In casting about me for subjects of the two courses of ten lectures each forwhich I thus became responsible, it seemed to me that the first course might well be a descriptive one on 'Man'sReligious Appetites,' and the second a metaphysical one on 'Their Satisfaction through Philosophy.' But theunexpected growth of the psychological matter as I came to write it out has resulted in the second subject beingpostponed entirely, and the description of man's religious constitution now fills the twenty lectures. In Lecture XX Ihave suggested rather than stated my own philosophic conclusions, and the reader who desires immediately to knowthem should turn to pages 456 463, and to the 'Postscript' of the book. I hope to be able at some later day to expressthem in more explicit form.In my belief that a large acquaintance with particulars often makes us wiser than the possession of abstract formulas,however deep, I have loaded the lectures with concrete examples, and I have chosen these among the extremerexpressions of the religious temperament. To some readers I may consequently seem, before they get beyond themiddle of the book, to offer a caricature of the subject. Such convulsions of piety, they will say, are not sane. If,however, they will have the patience to read to the end, I believe that this unfavorable impression will disappear; for Ithere combine the religious impulses with other principles of common sense which serve as correctives ofexaggeration, and allow the individual reader to draw as moderate conclusions as he will.My thanks for help in writing these lectures are due to Edwin D. Starbuck, of Stanford University, who made over tome his large collection of manuscript material; to Henry W. Rankin, of East Northfield, a friend unseen but proved, towhom I owe precious information; to Theodore Flournoy, of Geneva, to Canning Schiller, of Oxford, and to mycolleague Benjamin Rand, for documents; to my colleague Dickinson"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP4 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 05]Page 4S.

To usAmericans, the experience of receiving instruction from the living voice, as well as from the books, of Europeanscholars, is very familiar. At my own University of Harvard, not a winter passes without its harvest, large or small, oflectures from Scottish, English, French, or German representatives of the science or literature of their respectivecountries whom we have either induced to cross the ocean to address us, or captured on the wing as they were visitingour land. It seems the natural thing for us to listen whilst the Europeans talk. The contrary habit, of talking whilst theEuropeans listen, we have not yet acquired; and in him who first makes the adventure it begets a certain sense ofapology being due for so presumptuous an act. Particularly must this be the case of a soil as sacred to the Americanimagination as that of Edinburgh. The glories of the philosophic chair of this university were deeply impressed on myimagination in boyhood. Professor Fraser's Essays in Philosophy, then just published, was the first philosophic book Iever looked into, and I well remember the awestruck feeling I received from the account of Sir William Hamilton'sclass-room therein contained. Hamilton's own lectures were the first philosophic writings I ever forced myself tostudy, and after that I was immersed in Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown. Such juvenile emotions of reverencenever get outgrown; and I confess that to find my humble self promoted from my native wilderness to be actually forthe time an official here, and transmuted into a colleague of these illustrious names, carries with it a sense ofdreamland quite as much as of reality.But since I have received the honor of this appointment I have felt that it would never do to decline. The academiccareer also has its heroic obligations, so I stand here without further deprecatory words. Let me say only this, that nowthat the current, here and at Aberdeen, has begun to run from"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP12 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 36]Page 12west to east, I hope it may continue to do so. As the years go by, I hope that many of my countrymen may be asked tolecture in the Scottish universities, changing places with Scotsmen lecturing in the United States; I hope that ourpeople may become in all these higher matters even as one people; and that the peculiar philosophic temperament, aswell as the peculiar political temperament, that goes with our English speech may more and more pervade andinfluence the world.As regards the manner in which I shall have to administer this lectureship, I am neither a theologian, nor a scholarlearned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I amparticularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other ofthe facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, that, as a psychologist, the natural thing for mewould be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities.If the inquiry be psychological, not religious institutions, but rather religious feelings and religious impulses must beits subject, and I must confine myself to those more developed subjective phenomena recorded in literature producedby articulate and fully self-conscious men, in works of piety and autobiography. Interesting as the origins and earlystages of a subject always are, yet when one seeks earnestly for its full significance, one must always look to its morecompletely evolved and perfect forms. It follows from this that the documents that will most concern us will be thoseof the men who were most accomplished in the religious life and best able to give an intelligible account of their ideasand motives. These men, of course, are either comparatively modern writers, or else such earlier ones as have becomereligious classics. The documents humains which we shall find most instructive need not then be sought for in thehaunts of special erudition—they lie along the beaten highway; and this circumstance, which flows so naturally fromthe character of our problem, suits admirably also your lecturer's lack of special theological learning. I may take mycitations, my sentences"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP13 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 37]Page 13and paragraphs of personal confession, from books that most of you at some time will have had already in yourhands, and yet this will be no detriment to the value of my conclusions. It is true that some more adventurous readerand investigator, lecturing here in future, may unearth from the shelves of libraries documents that will make a moredelectable and curious entertainment to listen to than mine. Yet I doubt whether he will necessarily, by his control ofso much more out-of-the-way material, get much closer to the essence of the matter in hand.The question, What are the religious propensities? and the question, What is their philosophic significance? are twoentirely different orders of question from the logical point of view; and, as a failure to recognize this fact distinctlymay breed confusion, I wish to insist upon the point a little before we enter into the documents and materials to whichI have referred.In recent books on logic, distinction is made between two orders of inquiry concerning anything. First, what is thenature of it? how did it come about? what is its constitution, origin, and history? And second, What is its importance,meaning, or significance, now that it is once here? The answer to the one question is given in an existential judgmentor proposition. The answer to the other is a proposition of value, what the Germans call a Werthurtheil, or what wemay, if we like, denominate a spiritual judgment. Neither judgment can be deduced immediately from the other. Theyproceed from diverse intellectual preoccupations, and the mind combines them only by making them first separately,and then adding them together.In the matter of religions it is particularly easy to distinguish the two orders of question. Every religious phenomenonhas its history and its derivation from natural antecedents. What is nowadays called the higher criticism of the Bible isonly a study of the Bible from this existential point of view, neglected too much by the earlier church. Under justwhat biographic conditions did the sacred writers bring forth their various contributions to the holy volume? Andwhat had they exactly in their several individual minds, when they delivered their utterances? These are manifestly"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP14 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 39]Page 14questions of historical fact, and one does not see how the answer to them can decide offhand the still further question:of what use should such a volume, with its manner of coming into existence so defined, be to us as a guide to life anda revelation? To answer this other question we must have already in our mind some sort of a general theory as towhat the peculiarities in a thing should be which give it value for purposes of revelation; and this theory itself wouldbe what I just called a spiritual judgment. Combining it with our existential judgment, we might indeed deduceanother spiritual judgment as to the Bible's worth. Thus if our theory of revelation-value were to affirm that any book,to possess it, must have been composed automatically or not by the free caprice of the writer, or that it must exhibitno scientific and historic errors and express no local or personal passions, the Bible would probably fare ill at ourhands. But if, on the other hand, our theory should allow that a book may well be a revelation in spite of errors andpassions and deliberate human composition, if only it be a true record of the inner experiences of great-souled personswrestling with the crises of their fate, then the verdict would be much more favorable. You see that the existentialfacts by themselves are insufficient for determining the value; and the best adepts of the higher criticism accordinglynever confound the existential with the spiritual problem. With the same conclusions of fact before them, some takeone view, and some another, of the Bible's value as a revelation, according as their spiritual judgment as to thefoundation of values differs.I make these general remarks about the two sorts of judgment, because there are many religious persons—some of younow present, possibly, are among them—who do not yet make a working use of the distinction, and who maytherefore feel at first a little startled at the purely existential point of view from which in the following lectures thephenomena of religious experience must be considered. When I handle them biologically and psychologically as ifthey were mere curious facts of individual history, some of you may think it a degradation of so sublime a subject,and may even suspect me, until"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP15 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 40]Page 15my purpose gets more fully expressed, of deliberately seeking to discredit the religious side of life.Such a result is of course absolutely alien to my intention; and since such a prejudice on your part would seriouslyobstruct the due effect of much of what I have to relate, I will devote a few more words to the point.There can be no doubt that as a matter of fact a religious life, exclusively pursued, does tend to make the personexceptional and eccentric. I speak not now of your ordinary religious believer, who follows the conventionalobservances of his country, whether it be Buddhist, Christian, or Mohammedan. His religion has been made for himby others, communicated to him by tradition, determined to fixed forms by imitation, and retained by habit. It wouldprofit us little to study this second-hand religious life. We must make search rather for the original experiences whichwere the pattern-setters to all this mass of suggested feeling and imitated conduct. These experiénces we can only findin individuals for whom religion exists not as a dull habit, but as an acute fever rather. But such individuals are'geniuses' in the religious line; and like many other geniuses who have brought forth fruits effective enough forcommemoration in the pages of biography, such religious geniuses have often shown symptoms of nervous instability.Even more perhaps than other kinds of genius, religious leaders have been subject to abnormal psychical visitations.Invariably they have been creatures of exalted emotional sensibility. Often they have led a discordant inner life, andhad melancholy during a part of their career. They have known no measure, been liable to obsessions and fixed ideas;and frequently they have fallen into trances, heard voices, seen visions, and presented all sorts of peculiarities whichare ordinarily classed as pathological. Often, moreover, these pathological features in their career have helped to givethem their religious authority and influence.If you ask for a concrete example, there can be no better one than is furnished by the person of George Fox. TheQuaker religion which he founded is something which it is impossible to overpraise. In a day of shams, it was areligion of veracity rooted in spiritual inwardness, and a return to something more like the original gospel truth thanmen had"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP16 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 41]Page 16ever known in England. So far as our Christian sects to-day are evolving into liberality, they are simply reverting inessence to the position which Fox and the early Quakers so long ago assumed. No one can pretend for a moment thatin point of spiritual sagacity and capacity, Fox's mind was unsound. Every one who confronted him personally, fromOliver Cromwell down to county magistrates and jailers, seems to have acknowledged his superior power. Yet fromthe point of view of his nervous constitution, Fox was a psychopath or détraqué of the deepest dye. His Journalabounds in entries of this sort:—''As I was walking with several friends, I lifted up my head, and saw three steeple-house spires, and they struck at my life. I asked themwhat place that was? They said, Lichfield. Immediately the word of the Lord came to me, that I must go thither. Being come to the housewe were going to, I wished the friends to walk into the house, saying nothing to them of whither I was to go. As soon as they were goneI stept away, and went by my eye over hedge and ditch till I came within a mile of Lichfield; where, in a great field, shepherds werekeeping their sheep. Then was I commanded by the Lord to pull off my shoes. I stood still, for it was winter: but the word of the Lordwas like a fire in me. So I put off my shoes, and left them with the shepherds; and the poor shepherds trembled, and were astonished.Then I walked on about a mile, and as soon as I was got within the city, the word of the Lord came to me again, saying: Cry, 'Wo to thebloody city of Lichfield!' So I went up and down the streets, crying with a loud voice, Wo to the bloody city of Lichfield! It being marketday, I went into the market-place, and to and fro in the several parts of it, and made stands, crying as before, Wo to the bloody city ofLichfield! And no one laid hands on me. As I went thus crying through the streets, there seemed to me to be a channel of blood runningdown the streets, and the market-place appeared like a pool of blood. When I had declared what was upon me, and felt myself clear, Iwent out of the town in peace; and returning to the shepherds gave them some money, and took my shoes of them again."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP17 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 43]Page 17But the fire of the Lord was so on my feet, and all over me, that I did not matter to put on my shoes again, and was at a stand whether Ishould or no, till I felt freedom from the Lord so to do: then, after I had washed my feet, I put on my shoes again. After this a deepconsideration came upon me, for what reason I should be sent to cry against that city, and call it The bloody city! For though theparliament had the minister one while, and the king another, and much blood had been shed in the town during the wars between them,yet there was no more than had befallen many other places. But afterwards I came to understand, that in the Emperor Diocletian's time athousand Christians were martyr'd in Lichfield. So I was to go, without my shoes, through the channel of their blood, and into the pool oftheir blood in the market-place, that I might raise up the memorial of the blood of those martyrs, which had been shed above a thousandyears before, and lay cold in their streets. So the sense of this blood was upon me, and I obeyed the word of the Lord.\"Bent as we are on studying religion's existential conditions, we cannot possibly ignore these pathological aspects ofthe subject. We must describe and name them just as if they occurred in non-religious men. It is true that weinstinctively recoil from seeing an object to which our emotions and affections are committed handled by the intellectas any other object is handled. The first thing the intellect does with an object is to class it along with something else.But any object that is infinitely important to us and awakens our devotion feels to us also as if it must be sui generisand unique. Probably a crab would be filled with a sense of personal outrage if it could hear us class it without ado orapology as a crustacean, and thus dispose of it. \"I am no such thing,\" it would say; \"I am MYSELF, MYSELF alone.\"The next thing the intellect does is to lay bare the causes in which the thing originates. Spinoza says: \"I will analyzethe actions and appetites of men as if it were a question of lines, of planes, and of solids.\" And elsewhere he remarksthat he will consider our passions and their properties with the same"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP18 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 44]Page 18eye with which he looks on all other natural things, since the consequences of our affections flow from their naturewith the same necessity as it results from the nature of a triangle that its three angles should be equal to two rightangles. Similarly M. Taine, in the introduction to his history of English literature, has written: \"Whether facts bemoral or physical, it makes no matter. They always have their causes. There are causes for ambition, courage, veracity,just as there are for digestion, muscular movement, animal heat. Vice and virtue are products like vitriol and sugar.\"When we read such proclamations of the intellect bent on showing the existential conditions of absolutely everything,we feel—quite apart from our legitimate impatience at the somewhat ridiculous swagger of the program, in view ofwhat the authors are actually able to perform—menaced and negated in the springs of our innermost life. Such cold-blooded assimilations threaten, we think, to undo our soul's vital secrets, as if the same breath which should succeed inexplaining their origin would simultaneously explain away their significance, and make them appear of no morepreciousness, either, than the useful groceries of which M. Taine speaks.Perhaps the commonest expression of this assumption that spiritual value is undone if lowly origin be asserted is seenin those comments which unsentimental people so often pass on their more sentimental acquaintances. Alfred believesin immortality so strongly because his temperament is so emotional. Fanny's extraordinary conscientiousness is merelya matter of over-instigated nerves. William's melancholy about the universe is due to bad digestion—probably hisliver is torpid. Eliza's delight in her church is a symptom of her hysterical constitution. Peter would be less troubledabout his soul if he would take more exercise in the open air, etc. A more fully developed example of the same kind ofreasoning is the fashion, quite common nowadays among certain writers, of criticising the religious emotions byshowing a connection between them and the sexual life. Conversion is a crisis of puberty and adolescence. Themacerations of saints, and the devotion of missionaries, are only instances of the parental instinct of self-sacrificegone astray.

And the like.1We are surely all familiar in a general way with this method of discrediting states of mind for which we have anantipathy. We all use it to some degree in criticising persons whose states of mind we regard as overstrained. Butwhen other people criticise our own more exalted soul-flights by calling them1As with many ideas that float in the air of one's time, this notion shrinks from dogmatic general statement and expresses itself onlypartially and by innuendo. It seems to me that few conceptions are less instructive than this re-interpretation of religion as pervertedsexuality. It reminds one, so crudely is it often employed, of the famous Catholic taunt, that the Reformation may be best understood byremembering that its fons et origo was Luther's wish to marry a nun:—the effects are infinitely wider than the alleged causes, and for themost part opposite in nature. It is true that in the vast collection of religious phenomena, some are undisguisedly amatory—e.g., sex-deities and obscene rites in polytheism, and ecstatic feelings of union with the Saviour in a few Christian mystics. But then why notequally call religion an aberration of the digestive function, and prove one's point by the worship of Bacchus and Ceres, or by the ecstaticfeelings of some other saints about the Eucharist? Religious language clothes itself in such poor symbols as our life affords, and thewhole organism gives overtones of comment whenever the mind is strongly stirred to expression. Language drawn from eating anddrinking is probably as common in religious literature as is language drawn from the sexual life. We 'hunger and thirst' afterrighteousness; we 'find the Lord a sweet savor;' we 'taste and see that he is good.' 'Spiritual milk for American babes, drawn from thebreasts of both testaments,' is a sub-title of the once famous New England Primer, and Christian devotional literature indeed quite floatsin milk, thought of from the point of view, not of the mother, but of the greedy babe.Saint François de Sales, for instance, thus describes the 'orison of quietude': \"In this state the soul is like a little child still at the breast, whosemother, to caress him whilst he is still in her arms, makes her milk distill into his mouth without his even moving his lips. So it is here. OurLord desires that our will should be satisfied with sucking the milk which His Majesty pours into our mouth, and that we should relish thesweetness without even knowing that it cometh from the Lord.\" And again: \"Consider the little infants, united and joined to the breasts oftheir nursing mothers, you will see that from time to time they press themselves closer by little starts to which the pleasure of suckingprompts them. Even so, during its orison, the heart united to its God oftentimes makes attempts at closer union by movements during which itpresses closer upon the divine sweetness.\" Chemin de la Perfection, ch. xxxi.; Amour de Dieu, vii. ch. i.In fact, one might almost as well interpret religion as a perversion of the respiratory function.

But the champions of the latter will then saythat their chief argument has no analogue elsewhere. The two main phenomena of religion, namely, melancholy and conversion, they willsay, are essentially phenomena of adolescence, and therefore synchronous with the development of sexual life. To which the retort again iseasy. Even were the asserted synchrony unrestrictedly true as a fact (which it is not), it is not only the sexual life, but the entire higher mentallife which awakens during adolescence. One might then as well set up the thesis that the interest in mechanics, physics, chemistry, logic,philosophy, and sociology, which springs up during adolescent years along with that in poetry and religion, is also a perversion of the sexualinstinct:—but that would be too absurd. Moreover, if the argument from synchrony is to decide, what is to be done with the fact that thereligious age par excellence would seem to be old age, when the uproar of the sexual life is past?The plain truth is that to interpret religion one must in the end look at the immediate content of the religious consciousness. The moment onedoes this, one sees how wholly disconnected it is in the main from the content of the sexual consciousness. Everything about the two thingsdiffers, objects, moods, faculties concerned, and acts impelled to. Any general assimilation is simply impossible: what we find most often iscomplete hostility and contrast. If now the defenders of the sex-theory say that this makes no difference to their thesis; that without thechemical contributions which the sex-organs make to the blood, the brain would not be nourished so as to carry on religious activities, thisfinal proposition may be true or not true; but at any rate it has become profoundly uninstructive: we can deduce no consequences from itwhich help us to interpret religion's meaning or value. In this sense the religious life depends just as much upon the spleen, the pancreas, andthe kidneys as on the sexual apparatus, and the whole theory has lost its point in evaporating into a vague general assertion of thedependence, somehow, of the mind upon the body."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP21 hl[27 02 2011 00 27 53]Page 21sidering. Medical materialism finishes up Saint Paul by calling his vision on the road to Damascus a discharginglesion of the occipital cortex, he being an epileptic. It snuffs out Saint Teresa as an hysteric, Saint Francis of Assisi asan hereditary degenerate. George Fox's discontent with the shams of his age, and his pining for spiritual veracity, ittreats as a symptom of a disordered colon. Carlyle's organ-tones of misery it accounts for by a gastro-duodenalcatarrh. All such mental over-tensions, it says, are, when you come to the bottom of the matter, mere affairs ofdiathesis (auto-intoxications most probably), due to the perverted action of various glands which physiology will yetdiscover.And medical materialism then thinks that the spiritual authority of all such personages is successfully undermined.1Let us ourselves look at the matter in the largest possible way. Modern psychology, finding definite psycho-physicalconnections to hold good, assumes as a convenient hypothesis that the dependence of mental states upon bodilyconditions must be thorough-going and complete. If we adopt the assumption, then of course what medicalmaterialism insists on must be true in a general way, if not in every detail: Saint Paul certainly had once an epileptoid,if not an epileptic seizure; George Fox was an hereditary degenerate; Carlyle was undoubtedly auto-intoxicated bysome organ or other, no matter which,—and the rest. But now, I ask you, how can such an existential account of factsof mental history decide in one way or another upon their spiritual significance? According to the general postulate ofpsychology just referred to, there is not a single one of our states of mind, high or low, healthy or morbid, that has notsome organic process as its condition. Scientific theories are organically conditioned just as much as religiousemotions are; and if we only knew the facts intimately enough, we should doubtless see 'the liver' determining thedicta of the sturdy atheist as decisively as it does those of the Methodist under conviction anxious about his soul.When it alters in one way the blood that percolates it, we get the methodist, when in another way, we get1For a first-rate example of medical-materialist reasoning, see an article on 'les Variétés du Type dévot,' by Dr. Binet-Sanglé, in theRevue de l'Hypnotisme, xiv. 161."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP22 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 05]Page 22the atheist form of mind. So of all our raptures and our drynesses, our longings and pantings, our questions andbeliefs. They are equally organically founded, be they of religious or of non-religious content.To plead the organic causation of a religious state of mind, then, in refutation of its claim to possess superior spiritualvalue, is quite illogical and arbitrary, unless one have already worked out in advance some psycho-physical theoryconnecting spiritual values in general with determinate sorts of physiological change. Otherwise none of our thoughtsand feelings, not even our scientific doctrines, not even our dis- beliefs, could retain any value as revelations of thetruth, for every one of them without exception flows from the state of their possessor's body at the time.It is needless to say that medical materialism draws in point of fact no such sweeping skeptical conclusion. It is sure,just as every simple man is sure, that some states of mind are inwardly superior to others, and reveal to us more truth,and in this it simply makes use of an ordinary spiritual judgment. It has no physiological theory of the production ofthese its favorite states, by which it may accredit them; and its attempt to discredit the states which it dislikes, byvaguely associating them with nerves and liver, and connecting them with names connoting bodily affliction, isaltogether illogical and inconsistent.Let us play fair in this whole matter, and be quite candid with ourselves and with the facts. When we think certainstates of mind superior to others, is it ever because of what we know concerning their organic antecedents? No! it isalways for two entirely different reasons. It is either because we take an immediate delight in them; or else it isbecause we believe them to bring us good consequential fruits for life. When we speak disparagingly of 'feverishfancies,' surely the fever-process as such is not the ground of our disesteem—for aught we know to the contrary, 103°or 104° Fahrenheit might be a much more favorable temperature for truths to germinate and sprout in, than the moreordinary blood-heat of 97 or 98 degrees. It is either the disagreeableness itself of the fancies, or their inability to bearthe criticisms of the convalescent hour. When we praise the thoughts which health"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP23 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 07]Page 23brings, health's peculiar chemical metabolisms have nothing to do with determining our judgment. We know in factalmost nothing about these metabolisms. It is the character of inner happiness in the thoughts which stamps them asgood, or else their consistency with our other opinions and their serviceability for our needs, which make them passfor true in our esteem.Now the more intrinsic and the more remote of these criteria do not always hang together. Inner happiness andserviceability do not always agree. What immediately feels most 'good' is not always most 'true,' when measured bythe verdict of the rest of experience. The difference between Philip drunk and Philip sober is the classic instance incorroboration. If merely 'feeling good' could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience.But its revelations, however acutely satisfying at the moment, are inserted into an environment which refuses to bearthem out for any length of time. the consequence of this discrepancy of the two criteria is the uncertainty which stillprevails over so many of our spiritual judgments. There are moments of sentimental and mystical experience—weshall hereafter hear much of them—that carry an enormous sense of inner authority and illumination with them whenthey come. But they come seldom, and they do not come to every one; and the rest of life makes either no connectionwith them, or tends to contradict them more than it confirms them. Some persons follow more the voice of the momentin these cases, some prefer to be guided by the average results. Hence the sad discordancy of so many of the spiritualjudgments of human beings; a discordancy which will be brought home to us acutely enough before these lecturesend.It is, however, a discordancy that can never be resolved by any merely medical test. A good example of theimpossibility of holding strictly to the medical tests is seen in the theory of the pathological causation of geniuspromulgated by recent authors. \"Genius,\" said Dr. Moreau, \"is but one of the many branches of the neuropathic tree.\"\"Genius,\" says Dr. Lombroso, \"is a symptom of hereditary degeneration of the epileptoid variety, and is allied tomoral insanity.\" \"Whenever a"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP24 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 08]Page 24man's life,\" writes Mr. Nisbet, \"is at once sufficiently illustrious and recorded with sufficient fullness to be a subjectof profitable study, he inevitably falls into the morbid category. And it is worthy of remark that, as a rule, the greaterthe genius, the greater the unsoundness.\"1Now do these authors, after having succeeded in establishing to their own satisfaction that the works of genius arefruits of disease, consistently proceed thereupon to impugn the value of the fruits? do they deduce a new spiritualjudgment from their new doctrine of existential conditions? Do they frankly forbid us to admire the productions ofgenius from now onwards? and say outright that no neuropath can ever be a revealer of new truth?No! their immediate spiritual instincts are too strong for them here, and hold their own against inferences which, inmere love of logical consistency, medical materialism ought to be only too glad to draw. One disciple of the school,indeed, has striven to impugn the value of works of genius in a wholesale way (such works of contemporary art,namely, as he himself is unable to enjoy, and they are many) by using medical arguments.2 But for the most part themasterpieces are left unchallenged; and the medical line of attack either confines itself to such secular productions asevery one admits to be intrinsically eccentric, or else addresses itself exclusively to religious manifestations. And thenit is because the religious manifestations have been already condemned because the critic dislikes them on internal orspiritual grounds.In the natural sciences and industrial arts it never occurs to any one to try to refute opinions by showing up theirauthor's neurotic constitution. Opinions here are invariably tested by logic and by experiment, no matter what may betheir author's neurological type. It should be no otherwise with religious opinions. Their value can only be ascertainedby spiritual judgments directly passed upon them, judgments based on our own immediate feeling primarily; andsecondarily on what we can ascertain of their experiential relations to our moral needs and to the rest of what we holdas true.1J.

And conversely if her theology can standthese other tests, it will make no difference how hysterical or nervously off her balance Saint Teresa may have beenwhen she was with us here below.You see that at bottom we are thrown back upon the general principles by which the empirical philosophy has alwayscontended that we must be guided in our search for truth. Dogmatic philosophies have sought for tests for truth whichmight dispense us from appealing to the future. Some direct mark, by noting which we can be protected immediatelyand absolutely, now and forever, against all mistake—such has been the darling dream of philosophic dogmatists. It isclear that the origin of the truth would be an admirable criterion of this sort, if only the various origins could bediscriminated from one another from this point of view, and the history of dogmatic opinion shows that origin hasalways been a favorite test. Origin in immediate intuition; origin in pontifical authority; origin in supernaturalrevelation, as by vision, hearing, or unaccountable impression; origin in direct possession by a higher spirit, expressingitself in prophecy and warning; origin in automatic utterance generally,—these origins have been stock warrants forthe truth of one opinion after another which we find represented in religious history. The medical materialists aretherefore only so many belated dogmatists, neatly turning the tables on their predecessors by using the criterion oforigin in a destructive instead of an accreditive way.They are effective with their talk of pathological origin only so long as supernatural origin is pleaded by the otherside, and nothing but the argument from origin is under discussion. But the argument from origin has seldom beenused alone, for it is too obviously insufficient. Dr. Maudsley is perhaps the cleverest of the rebutters of supernaturalreligion on grounds of origin. Yet he finds himself forced to write:—"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP26 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 11]Page 26''What right have we to believe Nature under any obligation to do her work by means of complete minds only? Shemay find an incomplete mind a more suitable instrument for a particular purpose. It is the work that is done, and thequality in the worker by which it was done, that is alone of moment; and it may be no great matter from a cosmicalstandpoint, if in other qualities of character he was singularly defective—if indeed he were hypocrite, adulterer,eccentric, or lunatic. Home we come again, then, to the old and last resort of certitude,—namely the common assentof mankind, or of the competent by instruction and training among mankind.\"1In other words, not its origin, but the way in which it works on the whole, is Dr. Maudsley's final test of a belief. Thisis our own empiricist criterion; and this criterion the stoutest insisters on supernatural origin have also been forced touse in the end. Among the visions and messages some have always been too patently silly, among the trances andconvulsive seizures some have been too fruitless for conduct and character, to pass themselves off as significant, stillless as divine. In the history of Christian mysticism the problem how to discriminate between such messages andexperiences as were really divine miracles, and such others as the demon in his malice was able to counterfeit, thusmaking the religious person twofold more the child of hell he was before, has always been a difficult one to solve,needing all the sagacity and experience of the best directors of conscience. In the end it had to come to our empiricistcriterion: By their fruits ye shall know them, not by their roots. Jonathan Edwards's Treatise on Religious Affections isan elaborate working out of this thesis. The roots of a man's virtue are inaccessible to us. No appearances whateverare infallible proofs of grace. Our practice is the only sure evidence, even to ourselves, that we are genuinelyChristians.\"In forming a judgment of ourselves now,\" Edwards writes, \"we should certainly adopt that evidence which our supreme Judge willchiefly make use of when we come to1H. MAUDSLEY: Natural Causes and Supernatural Seemings, 1886, pp. 257, 256."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP27 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 12]Page 27stand before him at the last day. There is not one grace of the Spirit of God, of the existence of which, in any professor of religion,Christian practice is not the most decisive evidence. The degree in which our experience is productive of practice shows the degree inwhich our experience is spiritual and divine.\"Catholic writers are equally emphatic. The good dispositions which a vision, or voice, or other apparent heavenlyfavor leave behind them are the only marks by which we may be sure they are not possible deceptions of the tempter.Says Saint Teresa:—\"Like imperfect sleep which, instead of giving more strength to the head, doth but leave it the more exhausted, the result of mereoperations of the imagination is but to weaken the soul. Instead of nourishment and energy she reaps only lassitude and disgust: whereasa genuine heavenly vision yields to her a harvest of ineffable spiritual riches, and an admirable renewal of bodily strength. I alleged thesereasons to those who so often accused my visions of being the work of the enemy of mankind and the sport of my imagination. I showedthem the jewels which the divine hand had left with me:—they were my actual dispositions. All those who knew me saw that I waschanged; my confessor bore witness to the fact; this improvement, palpable in all respects, far from being hidden, was brilliantly evidentto all men. As for myself, it was impossible to believe that if the demon were its author, he could have used, in order to lose me and leadme to hell, an expedient so contrary to his own interests as that of uprooting my vices, and filling me with masculine courage and othervirtues instead, for I saw clearly that a single one of these visions was enough to enrich me with all that wealth.\"1I fear I may have made a longer excursus than was necessary, and that fewer words would have dispelled theuneasiness which may have arisen among some of you as I announced my pathological programme. At any rate youmust1Autobiography, ch. xxviii."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP28 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 13]Page 28all be ready now to judge the religious life by its results exclusively, and I shall assume that the bugaboo of morbidorigin will scandalize your piety no more.Still, you may ask me, if its results are to be the ground of our final spiritual estimate of a religious phenomenon, whythreaten us at all with so much existential study of its conditions? Why not simply leave pathological questions out?To this I reply in two ways: First, I say, irrepressible curiosity imperiously leads one on; and I say, secondly, that italways leads to a better understanding of a thing's significance to consider its exaggerations and perversions, itsequivalents and substitutes and nearest relatives elsewhere. Not that we may thereby swamp the thing in the wholesalecondemnation which we pass on its inferior congeners, but rather that we may by contrast ascertain the more preciselyin what its merits consists, by learning at the same time to what particular dangers of corruption it may also beexposed.Insane conditions have this advantage, that they isolate special factors of the mental life, and enable us to inspect themunmasked by their more usual surroundings. They play the part in mental anatomy which the scalpel and themicroscope play in the anatomy of the body. To understand a thing rightly we need to see it both out of itsenvironment and in it, and to have acquaintance with the whole range of its variations. The study of hallucinations hasin this way been for psychologists the key to their comprehension of normal sensation, that of illusions has been thekey to the right comprehension of perception. Morbid impulses and imperative conceptions, 'fixed ideas,' so called,have thrown a flood of light on the psychology of the normal will; and obsessions and delusions have performed thesame service for that of the normal faculty of belief.Similarly, the nature of genius has been illuminated by the attempts, of which I already made mention, to class it withpsychopathical phenomena. Borderland insanity, crankiness, insane temperament, loss of mental balance, psychopathicdegeneration (to use a few of the many synonyms by which it has been called), has certain peculiarities and liabilitieswhich, when combined with a superior quality of intellect in an individual, make it more probable that he will makehis mark"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP29 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 15]Page 29and affect his age, than if his temperament were less neurotic. There is of course no special affinity betweencrankiness as such and superior intellect,1 for most psychopaths have feeble intellects, and superior intellects morecommonly have normal nervous systems. But the psychopathic temperament, whatever be the intellect with which itfinds itself paired, often brings with it ardor and excitability of character. The cranky person has extraordinaryemotional susceptibility. He is liable to fixed ideas and obsessions. His conceptions tend to pass immediately intobelief and action; and when he gets a new idea, he has no rest till he proclaims it, or in some way 'works it off.' \"Whatshall I think of it?\" a common person says to himself about a vexed question; but in a 'cranky' mind \"What must I doabout it?\" is the form the question tends to take. In the autobiography of that high-souled woman, Mrs. Annie Besant,I read the following passage: \"Plenty of people wish well to any good cause, but very few care to exert themselves tohelp it, and still fewer will risk anything in its support. 'Some one ought to do it, but why should I?' is the everreëchoed phrase of weak-kneed amiability. 'Some one ought to do it, so why not I?' is the cry of some earnest servantof man, eagerly forward springing to face some perilous duty. Between these two sentences lie whole centuries ofmoral evolution.'' True enough! and between these two sentences lie also the different destinies of the ordinarysluggard and the psychopathic man. Thus, when a superior intellect and a psychopathic temperament coalesce—as inthe endless permutations and combinations of human faculty, they are bound to coalesce often enough—in the sameindividual, we have the best possible condition for the kind of effective genius that gets into the biographicaldictionaries. Such men do not remain mere critics and understanders with their intellect. Their ideas possess them,they inflict them, for better or worse, upon their companions or their age. It is they who get counted when MessrsLombroso, Nisbet, and others invoke statistics to defend their paradox.To pass now to religious phenomena, take the melancholy1Superior intellect, as Professor Bain has admirably shown, seems to consist in nothing so much as in a large development of the facultyof association by similarity."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP30 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 16]Page 30which, as we shall see, constitutes an essential moment in every complete religious evolution. Take the happinesswhich achieved religious belief confers. Take the trance-like states of insight into truth which all religious mysticsreport.1 These are each and all of them special cases of kinds of human experience of much wider scope. Religiousmelancholy, whatever peculiarities it may have quâ religious, is at any rate melancholy. Religious happiness ishappiness. Religious trance is trance. And the moment we renounce the absurd notion that a thing is exploded away assoon as it is classed with others, or its origin is shown; the moment we agree to stand by experimental results andinner quality, in judging of values,—who does not see that we are likely to ascertain the distinctive significance ofreligious melancholy and happiness, or of religious trances, far better by comparing them as conscientiously as we canwith other varieties of melancholy, happiness, and trance, than by refusing to consider their place in any more generalseries, and treating them as if they were outside of nature's order altogether?I hope that the course of these lectures will confirm us in this supposition. As regards the psychopathic origin of somany religious phenomena, that would not be in the least surprising or disconcerting, even were such phenomenacertified from on high to be the most precious of human experiences. No one organism can possibly yield to its ownerthe whole body of truth. Few of us are not in some way infirm, or even diseased; and our very infirmities help usunexpectedly. In the psychopathic temperament we have the emotionality which is the sine quâ non of moralperception; we have the intensity and tendency to emphasis which are the essence of practical moral vigor; and wehave the love of metaphysics and mysticism which carry one's interests beyond the surface of the sensible world.What, then, is more natural than that this temperament should introduce one to regions of religious truth, to corners ofthe universe, which your robust Philistine type of nervous system, forever offering its biceps to be felt, thumping itsbreast, and thanking Heaven that it has n't a1I may refer to a criticism of the insanity theory of genius in the Psychological Review, ii. 287 (1895)."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP31 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 17]Page 31single morbid fibre in its composition, would be sure to hide forever from its self-satisfied possessors?If there were such a thing as inspiration from a higher realm, it might well be that the neurotic temperament wouldfurnish the chief condition of the requisite receptivity. And having said thus much, I think that I may let the matter ofreligion and neuroticism drop.The mass of collateral phenomena, morbid or healthy, with which the various religious phenomena must be comparedin order to understand them better, forms what in the slang of pedagogics is termed 'the apperceiving mass' by whichwe comprehend them. The only novelty that I can imagine this course of lectures to possess lies in the breadth of theapperceiving mass.

Someof these would-be definitions may possibly come before us in later portions of this course, and I shall not be pedanticenough to enumerate any of them to you now. Meanwhile the very fact that they are so many and so different fromone another is enough to prove that the word 'religion' cannot stand for any single principle or essence, but is rather acollective name. The theorizing mind tends always to the oversimplification of its materials. This is the root of all thatabsolutism and one-sided dogmatism by which both philosophy and religion have been infested. Let us not fallimmediately into a one-sided view of our subject, but let us rather admit freely at the outset that we may very likelyfind no one essence, but many characters which may alternately be equally important in religion. If we should inquirefor the essence of 'government,' for example, one man might tell us it was authority, another submission, anotherpolice, another an army, another an assembly, another a system of laws; yet all the while it would be true that noconcrete government can exist without all these things, one of which is more important at one moment and others atanother. The man who knows governments most completely is he who troubles himself least about a definition whichshall give their essence. Enjoying an intimate acquaintance with all their particularities in turn, he would naturallyregard an abstract conception in which these were unified as a thing more misleading than enlightening. And why maynot religion be a conception equally complex?1Consider also the 'religious sentiment' which we see1I can do no better here than refer my readers to the extended and admirable remarks on the futility of all these definitions of religion, inan article by Professor Leuba, published in the Monist for January, 1901, after my own text was written."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP33 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 20]Page 33referred to in so many books, as if it were a single sort of mental entity.In the psychologies and in the philosophies of religion, we find the authors attempting to specify just what entity it is.One man allies it to the feeling of dependence; one makes it a derivative from fear; others connect it with the sexuallife; others still identify it with the feeling of the infinite; and so on. Such different ways of conceiving it ought ofthemselves to arouse doubt as to whether it possibly can be one specific thing; and the moment we are willing to treatthe term 'religious sentiment' as a collective name for the many sentiments which religious objects may arouse inalternation, we see that it probably contains nothing whatever of a psychologically specific nature. There is religiousfear, religious love, religious awe, religious joy, and so forth. But religious love is only man's natural emotion of lovedirected to a religious object; religious fear is only the ordinary fear of commerce, so to speak, the common quakingof the human breast, in so far as the notion of divine retribution may arouse it; religious awe is the same organic thrillwhich we feel in a forest at twilight, or in a mountain gorge; only this time it comes over us at the thought of oursupernatural relations; and similarly of all the various sentiments which may be called into play in the lives ofreligious persons. As concrete states of mind, made up of a feeling plus a specific sort of object, religious emotions ofcourse are psychic entities distinguishable from other concrete emotions; but there is no ground for assuming a simpleabstract 'religious emotion' to exist as a distinct elementary mental affection by itself, present in every religiousexperience without exception.As there thus seems to be no one elementary religious emotion, but only a common storehouse of emotions uponwhich religious objects may draw, so there might conceivably also prove to be no one specific and essential kind ofreligious object, and no one specific and essential kind of religious act.The field of religion being as wide as this, it is manifestly impossible that I should pretend to cover it. My lecturesmust be limited to a fraction of the subject. And, although it would indeed be foolish to set up an abstract definition ofreligion's"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP34 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 21]Page 34essence, and then proceed to defend that definition against all comers, yet this need not prevent me from taking myown narrow view of what religion shall consist in for the purpose of these lectures, or, out of the many meanings ofthe word, from choosing the one meaning in which I wish to interest you particularly, and proclaiming arbitrarily thatwhen I say 'religion' I mean that. This, in fact, is what I must do, and I will now preliminarily seek to mark out thefield I choose.One way to mark it out easily is to say what aspects of the subject we leave out. At the outset we are struck by onegreat partition which divides the religious field. On the one side of it lies institutional, on the other personal religion.As M. P. Sabatier says, one branch of religion keeps the divinity, another keeps man most in view. Worship andsacrifice, procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity, theology and ceremony and ecclesiasticalorganization, are the essentials of religion in the institutional branch. Were we to limit our view to it, we should haveto define religion as an external art, the art of winning the favor of the gods. In the more personal branch of religion itis on the contrary the inner dispositions of man himself which form the centre of interest, his conscience, his deserts,his helplessness, his incompleteness. And although the favor of the God, as forfeited or gained, is still an essentialfeature of the story, and theology plays a vital part therein, yet the acts to which this sort of religion prompts arepersonal not ritual acts, the individual transacts the business by himself alone, and the ecclesiastical organization, withits priests and sacraments and other go-betweens, sinks to an altogether secondary place. The relation goes direct fromheart to heart, from soul to soul, between man and his maker.Now in these lectures I propose to ignore the institutional branch entirely, to say nothing of the ecclesiasticalorganization, to consider as little as possible the systematic theology and the ideas about the gods themselves, and toconfine myself as far as I can to personal religion pure and simple. To some of you personal religion, thus nakedlyconsidered, will no doubt seem too incomplete a thing to wear the general name. \"It is a part of religion,\" you willsay, \"but only its unorganized rudiment; if we are to name it by itself, we had"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP35 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 22]Page 35better call it man's conscience or morality than his religion. The name 'religion' should be reserved for the fullyorganized system of feeling, thought, and institution, for the Church, in short, of which this personal religion, socalled, is but a fractional element.\"But if you say this, it will only show the more plainly how much the question of definition tends to become a disputeabout names. Rather than prolong such a dispute, I am willing to accept almost any name for the personal religion ofwhich I propose to treat. Call it conscience or morality, if you yourselves prefer, and not religion—under either nameit will be equally worthy of our study. As for myself, I think it will prove to contain some elements which moralitypure and simple does not contain, and these elements I shall soon seek to point out; so I will myself continue to applythe word 'religion' to it; and in the last lecture of all, I will bring in the theologies and the ecclesiasticisms, and saysomething of its relation to them.In one sense at least the personal religion will prove itself more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism.Churches, when once established, live at second-hand upon tradition; but the founders of every church owed theirpower originally to the fact of their direct personal communion with the divine. Not only the superhuman founders,the Christ, the Buddha, Mahomet, but all the originators of Christian sects have been in this case;—so personalreligion should still seem the primordial thing, even to those who continue to esteem it incomplete.There are, it is true, other things in religion chronologically more primordial than personal devoutness in the moralsense. Fetishism and magic seem to have preceded inward piety historically—at least our records of inward piety donot reach back so far. And if fetishism and magic be regarded as stages of religion, one may say that personal religionin the inward sense and the genuinely spiritual ecclesiasticisms which it founds are phenomena of secondary or eventertiary order. But, quite apart from the fact that many anthropologists—for instance, Jevons and Frazer—expresslyoppose 'religion' and 'magic' to each other, it is certain that the whole system of thought which leads to magic,fetishism, and the lower"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP36 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 29]Page 36superstitions may just as well be called primitive science as called primitive religion. The question thus becomes averbal one again; and our knowledge of all these early stages of thought and feeling is in any case so conjectural andimperfect that farther discussion would not be worth while.Religion, therefore, as I now ask you arbitrarily to take it, shall mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences ofindividual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they mayconsider the divine. Since the relation may be either moral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in thesense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical organizations may secondarily grow. In theselectures, however, as I have already said, the immediate personal experiences will amply fill our time, and we shallhardly consider theology or ecclesiasticism at all.We escape much controversial matter by this arbitrary definition of our field. But, still, a chance of controversy comesup over the word 'divine,' if we take it in the definition in too narrow a sense. There are systems of thought which theworld usually calls religious, and yet which do not positively assume a God. Buddhism is in this case. Popularly, ofcourse, the Buddha himself stands in place of a God; but in strictness the Buddhistic system is atheistic. Moderntranscendental idealism, Emersonianism, for instance, also seems to let God evaporate into abstract Ideality. Not adeity in concreto, not a superhuman person, but the immanent divinity in things, the essentially spiritual structure ofthe universe, is the object of the transcendentalist cult. In that address to the graduating class at Divinity College in1838 which made Emerson famous, the frank expression of this worship of mere abstract laws was what made thescandal of the performance.\"These laws,\" said the speaker, \"execute themselves. They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance: Thus, in the soulof man there is a justice whose retributions are instant and entire. He who does a good deed is instantly ennobled. He who does a meandeed is by the action itself contracted. He who puts off impurity thereby puts on purity. If a man is at heart just, then in so"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP37 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 41]Page 37far is he God; the safety of God, the immortality of God, the majesty of God, do enter into that man with justice. If a man dissemble,deceive, he deceives himself, and goes out of acquaintance with his own being. Character is always known. Thefts never enrich; almsnever impoverish; murder will speak out of stone walls. The least admixture of a lie—for example, the taint of vanity, any attempt tomake a good impression, a favorable appearance—will instantly vitiate the effect. But speak the truth, and all things alive or brute arevouchers, and the very roots of the grass underground there do seem to stir and move to bear you witness. For all things proceed out ofthe same spirit, which is differently named love, justice, temperance, in its different applications, just as the ocean receives differentnames on the several shores which it washes. In so far as he roves from these ends, a man bereaves himself of power, of auxiliaries. Hisbeing shrinks he becomes less and less, a mote, a point, until absolute badness is absolute death. The perception of this law awakens inthe mind a sentiment which we call the religious sentiment, and which makes our highest happiness. Wonderful is its power to charm andto command. It is a mountain air. It is the embalmer of the world. It makes the sky and the hills sublime, and the silent song of the stars isit. It is the beatitude of man. It makes him illimitable. When he says 'I ought'; when love warms him; when he chooses, warned from onhigh, the good and great deed; then, deep melodies wander through his soul from supreme wisdom. Then he can worship, and beenlarged by his worship; for he can never go behind this sentiment. All the expressions of this sentiment are sacred and permanent inproportion to their purity. [They] affect us more than all other compositions. The sentences of the olden time, which ejaculate this piety,are still fresh and fragrant. And the unique impression of Jesus upon mankind, whose name is not so much written as ploughed into thehistory of this world, is proof of the subtle virtue of this infusion.\"1Such is the Emersonian religion. The universe has a divine1Miscellanies, 1868, p. 120 (abridged)."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP38 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 42]Page 38soul of order, which soul is moral, being also the soul within the soul of man. But whether this soul of the universe bea mere quality like the eye's brilliancy or the skin's softness, or whether it be a self-conscious life like the eye's seeingor the skin's feeling, is a decision that never unmistakably appears in Emerson's pages. It quivers on the boundary ofthese things, sometimes leaning one way, sometimes the other, to suit the literary rather than the philosophic need.Whatever it is, though, it is active. As much as if it were a God, we can trust it to protect all ideal interests and keepthe world's balance straight. The sentences in which Emerson, to the very end, gave utterance to this faith are as fineas anything in literature: \"If you love and serve men, you cannot by any hiding or stratagem escape the remuneration.Secret retributions are always restoring the level, when disturbed, of the divine justice. It is impossible to tilt the beam.All the tyrants and proprietors and monopolists of the world in vain set their shoulders to heave the bar. Settlesforevermore the ponderous equator to its line, and man and mote, and star and sun, must range to it, or be pulverizedby the recoil.\"1Now it would be too absurd to say that the inner experiences that underlie such expressions of faith as this and impelthe writer to their utterance are quite unworthy to be called religious experiences. The sort of appeal that Emersonianoptimism, on the one hand, and Buddhistic pessimism, on the other, make to the individual and the sort of responsewhich he makes to them in his life are in fact indistinguishable from, and in many respects identical with, the bestChristian appeal and response. We must therefore, from the experiential point of view, call these godless or quasi-godless creeds 'religions'; and accordingly when in our definition of religion we speak of the individual's relation to'what he considers the divine,' we must interpret the term 'divine' very broadly, as denoting any object that is godlike,whether it be a concrete deity or not.But the term 'godlike,' if thus treated as a floating general quality, becomes exceedingly vague, for many gods haveflourished in religious history, and their attributes have been1Lectures and Biographical Sketches, 1868, p. 186."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP39 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 43]Page 39discrepant enough. What then is that essentially godlike quality—be it embodied in a concrete deity or not—ourrelation to which determines our character as religious men? It will repay us to seek some answer to this questionbefore we proceed farther.For one thing, gods are conceived to be first things in the way of being and power. They overarch and envelop, andfrom them there is no escape. What relates to them is the first and last word in the way of truth. Whatever then weremost primal and enveloping and deeply true might at this rate be treated as godlike, and a man's religion might thusbe identified with his attitude, whatever it might be, towards what he felt to be the primal truth.Such a definition as this would in a way be defensible. Religion, whatever it is, is a man's total reaction upon life, sowhy not say that any total reaction upon life is a religion? Total reactions are different from casual reactions, and totalattitudes are different from usual or professional attitudes. To get at them you must go behind the foreground ofexistence and reach down to that curious sense of the whole residual cosmos as an everlasting presence, intimate oralien, terrible or amusing, lovable or odious, which in some degree every one possesses. This sense of the world'spresence, appealing as it does to our peculiar individual temperament, makes us either strenuous or careless, devout orblasphemous, gloomy or exultant, about life at large; and our reaction, involuntary and inarticulate and often halfunconscious as it is, is the completest of all our answers to the question, ''What is the character of this universe inwhich we dwell?\" It expresses our individual sense of it in the most definite way. Why then not call these reactionsour religion, no matter what specific character they may have? Non-religious as some of these reactions may be, inone sense of the word 'religious,' they yet belong to the general sphere of the religious life, and so should genericallybe classed as religious reactions. \"He believes in No-God, and he worships him,\" said a colleague of mine of astudent who was manifesting a fine atheistic ardor; and the more fervent opponents of Christian doctrine have oftenenough shown a temper which, psychologically considered, is indistinguishable from religious zeal."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP40 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 45]Page 40But so very broad a use of the word 'religion' would be inconvenient, however defensible it might remain on logicalgrounds. There are trifling, sneering attitudes even towards the whole of life; and in some men these attitudes are finaland systematic. It would strain the ordinary use of language too much to call such attitudes religious, even though,from the point of view of an unbiased critical philosophy, they might conceivably be perfectly reasonable ways oflooking upon life. Voltaire, for example, writes thus to a friend, at the age of seventy-three: \"As for myself,\" he says,\"weak as I am, I carry on the war to the last moment, I get a hundred pike-thrusts, I return two hundred, and I laugh. Isee near my door Geneva on fire with quarrels over nothing, and I laugh again; and, thank God, I can look upon theworld as a farce even when it becomes as tragic as it sometimes does. All comes out even at the end of the day, andall comes out still more even when all the days are over.\"Much as we may admire such a robust old gamecock spirit in a valetudinarian, to call it a religious spirit would beodd. Yet it is for the moment Voltaire's reaction on the whole of life. Je m'en fiche is the vulgar French equivalent forour English ejaculation 'Who cares?' And the happy term je m'en fichisme recently has been invented to designate thesystematic determination not to take anything in life too solemnly. 'All is vanity' is the relieving word in all difficultcrises for this mode of thought, which that exquisite literary genius Renan took pleasure, in his later days of sweetdecay, in putting into coquettishly sacrilegious forms which remain to us as excellent expressions of the 'all is vanity'state of mind. Take the following passage, for example,—we must hold to duty, even against the evidence, Renansays,—but he then goes on:—\"There are many chances that the world may be nothing but a fairy pantomime of which no God has care. We must therefore arrangeourselves so that on neither hypothesis we shall be completely wrong. We must listen to the superior voices, but in such a way that if thesecond hypothesis were true we should not have been too completely duped. If in effect the world be not a serious thing, it is thedogmatic people who will be the shallow ones, and the worldly"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP41 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 46]Page 41minded whom the theologians now call frivolous will be those who are really wise.\"In utrumque paratus, then. Be ready for anything—that perhaps is wisdom. Give ourselves up, according to the hour, to confidence, toskepticism, to optimism, to irony, and we may be sure that at certain moments at least we shall be with the truth. Good-humor is aphilosophic state of mind; it seems to say to Nature that we take her no more seriously than she takes us. I maintain that one shouldalways talk of philosophy with a smile. We owe it to the Eternal to be virtuous; but we have the right to add to this tribute our irony as asort of personal reprisal. In this way we return to the right quarter jest for jest; we play the trick that has been played on us. SaintAugustine's phrase: Lord, if we are deceived, it is by thee! remains a fine one, well suited to our modern feeling. Only we wish theEternal to know that if we accept the fraud, we accept it knowingly and willingly. We are resigned in advance to losing the interest onour investments of virtue, but we wish not to appear ridiculous by having counted on them too securely.\"1Surely all the usual associations of the word 'religion' would have to be stripped away if such a systematic parti prisof irony were also to be denoted by the name. For common men 'religion,' whatever more special meanings it mayhave, signifies always a serious state of mind. If any one phrase could gather its universal message, that phrase wouldbe, 'All is not vanity in this Universe, whatever the appearances may suggest.' If it can stop anything, religion ascommonly apprehended can stop just such chaffing talk as Renan's. It favors gravity, not pertness; it says 'hush' to allvain chatter and smart wit.But if hostile to light irony, religion is equally hostile to heavy grumbling and complaint. The world appears tragicenough in some religions, but the tragedy is realized as purging, and a way of deliverance is held to exist. We shallsee enough of the religious melancholy in a future lecture; but melancholy, according to our ordinary use of language,1Feuilles détachées, pp. 394 398 (abridged)."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP42 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 47]Page 42forfeits all title to be called religious when, in Marcus Aurelius's racy words, the sufferer simply lies kicking andscreaming after the fashion of a sacrificed pig. The mood of a Schopenhauer or a Nietzsche,—and in a less degreeone may sometimes say the same of our own sad Carlyle,—though often an ennobling sadness, is almost as often onlypeevishness running away with the bit between its teeth. The sallies of the two German authors remind one, half thetime, of the sick shriekings of two dying rats. They lack the purgatorial note which religious sadness gives forth.There must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude which we denominate religious. If glad, itmust not grin or snicker; if sad, it must not scream or curse. It is precisely as being solemn experiences that I wish tointerest you in religious experiences. So I propose—arbitrarily again, if you please—to narrow our definition oncemore by saying that the word 'divine,' as employed therein, shall mean for us not merely the primal and envelopingand real, for that meaning if taken without restriction might well prove too broad. The divine shall mean for us onlysuch a primal reality as the individual feels impelled to respond to solemnly and gravely, and neither by a curse nor ajest.But solemnity, and gravity, and all such emotional attributes, admit of various shades; and, do what we will with ourdefining, the truth must at last be confronted that we are dealing with a field of experience where there is not a singleconception that can be sharply drawn. The pretension, under such conditions, to be rigorously 'scientific' or 'exact' inour terms would only stamp us as lacking in understanding of our task. Things are more or less divine, states of mindare more or less religious, reactions are more or less total, but the boundaries are always misty, and it is everywhere aquestion of amount and degree. Nevertheless, at their extreme of development, there can never be any question as towhat experiences are religious. The divinity of the object and the solemnity of the reaction are too well marked fordoubt. Hesitation as to whether a state of mind is 'religious,' or 'irreligious,' or 'moral,' or 'philosophical,' is only likelyto arise when the state of mind is weakly characterized, but in that case it will be hardly worthy of our study at all.With"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP43 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 49]Page 43states that can only by courtesy be called religious we need have nothing to do, our only profitable business beingwith what nobody can possibly feel tempted to call anything else. I said in my former lecture that we learn most abouta thing when we view it under a microscope, as it were, or in its most exaggerated form. This is as true of religiousphenomena as of any other kind of fact. The only cases likely to be profitable enough to repay our attention willtherefore be cases where the religious spirit is unmistakable and extreme. Its fainter manifestations we may tranquillypass by. Here, for example, is the total reaction upon life of Frederick Locker Lampson, whose autobiography, entitled'Confidences,' proves him to have been a most amiable man.\"I am so far resigned to my lot that I feel small pain at the thought of having to part from what has been called the pleasant habit ofexistence, the sweet fable of life. I would not care to live my wasted life over again, and so to prolong my span. Strange to say, I havebut little wish to be younger. I submit with a chill at my heart. I humbly submit because it is the Divine Will, and my appointed destiny.I dread the increase of infirmities that will make me a burden to those around me, those dear to me. No! let me slip away as quietly andcomfortably as I can. Let the end come, if peace come with it.\"I do not know that there is a great deal to be said for this world, or our sojourn here upon it; but it has pleased God so to place us, and itmust please me also. I ask you, what is human life? Is not it a maimed happiness—care and weariness, weariness and care, with thebaseless expectation, the strange cozenage of a brighter to-morrow? At best it is but a froward child, that must be played with andhumored, to keep it quiet till it falls asleep, and then the care is over.\"1This is a complex, a tender, a submissive, and a graceful state of mind. For myself, I should have no objection tocalling it on the whole a religious state of mind, although I dare say that to many of you it may seem too listless andhalf-1Op. cit., pp. 314, 313."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP44 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 50]Page 44hearted to merit so good a name. But what matters it in the end whether we call such a state of mind religious or not?It is too insignificant for our instruction in any case; and its very possessor wrote it down in terms which he would nothave used unless he had been thinking of more energetically religious moods in others, with which he found himselfunable to compete. It is with these more energetic states that our sole business lies, and we can perfectly well afford tolet the minor notes and the uncertain border go.It was the extremer cases that I had in mind a little while ago when I said that personal religion, even without theologyor ritual, would prove to embody some elements that morality pure and simple does not contain. You may rememberthat I promised shortly to point out what those elements were. In a general way I can now say what I had in mind.\"I accept the universe\" is reported to have been a favorite utterance of our New England transcendentalist, MargaretFuller; and when some one repeated this phrase to Thomas Carlyle, his sardonic comment is said to have been: \"Gad!she'd better!\" At bottom the whole concern of both morality and religion is with the manner of our acceptance of theuniverse. Do we accept it only in part and grudgingly, or heartily and altogether? Shall our protests against certainthings in it be radical and unforgiving, or shall we think that, even with evil, there are ways of living that must lead togood? If we accept the whole, shall we do so as if stunned into submission,—as Carlyle would have us—\"Gad! we'dbetter!\"—or shall we do so with enthusiastic assent? Morality pure and simple accepts the law of the whole which itfinds reigning, so far as to acknowledge and obey it, but it may obey it with the heaviest and coldest heart, and nevercease to feel it as a yoke. But for religion, in its strong and fully developed manifestations, the service of the highestnever is felt as a yoke. Dull submission is left far behind, and a mood of welcome, which may fill any place on thescale between cheerful serenity and enthusiastic gladness, has taken its place.It makes a tremendous emotional and practical difference to one whether one accept the universe in the drabdiscolored way of stoic resignation to necessity, or with the"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP45 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 51]Page 45passionate happiness of Christian saints. The difference is as great as that between passivity and activity, as thatbetween the defensive and the aggressive mood. Gradual as are the steps by which an individual may grow from onestate into the other, many as are the intermediate stages which different individuals represent, yet when you place thetypical extremes beside each other for comparison, you feel that two discontinuous psychological universes confrontyou, and that in passing from one to the other a 'critical point' has been overcome.If we compare stoic with Christian ejaculations we see much more than a difference of doctrine; rather is it adifference of emotional mood that parts them. When Marcus Aurelius reflects on the eternal reason that has orderedthings, there is a frosty chill about his words which you rarely find in a Jewish, and never in a Christian piece ofreligious writing. The universe is 'accepted' by all these writers; but how devoid of passion or exultation the spirit ofthe Roman Emperor is! Compare his fine sentence: \"If gods care not for me or my children, here is a reason for it,\"with Job's cry: \"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him!\" and you immediately see the difference I mean. Theanima mundi, to whose disposal of his own personal destiny the Stoic consents, is there to be respected and submittedto, but the Christian God is there to be loved; and the difference of emotional atmosphere is like that between an arcticclimate and the tropics, though the outcome in the way of accepting actual conditions uncomplainingly may seem inabstract terms to be much the same.\"It is a man's duty,\" says Marcus Aurelius, \"to comfort himself and wait for the natural dissolution, and not to be vexed, but to findrefreshment solely in these thoughts—first that nothing will happen to me which is not conformable to the nature of the universe; andsecondly that I need do nothing contrary to the God and deity within me; for there is no man who can compel me to transgress.1 He is anabscess on the universe who withdraws and separates himself from the reason of our common nature, through1Book V., ch. x. (abridged)."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP46 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 53]Page 46being displeased with the things which happen. For the same nature produces these, and has produced thee too. And so accept everythingwhich happens, even if it seem disagreeable, because it leads to this, the health of the universe and to the prosperity and felicity of Zeus.For he would not have brought on any man what he has brought, if it were not useful for the whole. The integrity of the whole ismutilated if thou cuttest off anything. And thou dost cut off, as far as it is in thy power, when thou art dissatisfied, and in a manner triestto put anything out of the way.\"1Compare now this mood with that of the old Christian author of the Theologia Germanica:—\"Where men are enlightened with the true light, they renounce all desire and choice, and commit and commend themselves and all thingsto the eternal Goodness, so that every enlightened man could say: 'I would fain be to the Eternal Goodness what his own hand is to aman.' Such men are in a state of freedom, because they have lost the fear of pain or hell, and the hope of reward or heaven, and are livingin pure submission to the eternal Goodness, in the perfect freedom of fervent love. When a man truly perceiveth and considereth himself,who and what he is, and findeth himself utterly vile and wicked and unworthy, he falleth into such a deep abasement that it seemeth tohim reasonable that all creatures in heaven and earth should rise up against him. And therefore he will not and dare not desire anyconsolation and release; but he is willing to be unconsoled and unreleased; and he doth not grieve over his sufferings, for they are rightin his eyes, and he hath nothing to say against them. This is what is meant by true repentance for sin; and he who in this present timeentereth into this hell, none may console him. Now God hath not forsaken a man in this hell, but He is laying his hand upon him, that theman may not desire nor regard anything but the eternal Good only. And then, when the man neither careth for nor desireth anything butthe eternal Good1Book V., ch. ix. (abridged)."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP47 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 54]Page 47alone, and seeketh not himself nor his own things, but the honour of God only, he is made a partaker of all manner of joy, bliss, peace,rest, and consolation, and so the man is henceforth in the kingdom of heaven. This hell and this heaven are two good safe ways for aman, and happy is he who truly findeth them.\"1How much more active and positive the impulse of the Christian writer to accept his place in the universe is! MarcusAurelius agrees to the scheme—the German theologian agrees with it. He literally abounds in agreement, he runs outto embrace the divine decrees.Occasionally, it is true, the Stoic rises to something like a Christian warmth of sentiment, as in the often quotedpassage of Marcus Aurelius:—\"Everything harmonizes with me which is harmonious to thee, O Universe. Nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in due timefor thee. Everything is fruit to me which thy seasons bring, O Nature: from thee are all things, in thee are all things, to thee all things, tothee all things return. The poet says, Dear City of Cecrops; and wilt thou not say, Dear City of Zeus?\"2But compare even as devout a passage as this with a genuine Christian outpouring, and it seems a little cold. Turn, forinstance, to the Imitation of Christ:—\"Lord, thou knowest what is best; let this or that be according as thou wilt. Give what thou wilt, so much as thou wilt, when thou wilt.Do with me as thou knowest best, and as shall be most to thine honour. Place me where thou wilt, and freely work thy will with me in allthings. When could it be evil when thou wert near? I had rather be poor for thy sake than rich without thee. I choose rather to be apilgrim upon the earth with thee, than without thee1Chaps. x., xi.

Where thou art, there is heaven; and where thou art not, behold there death and hell.\"1It is a good rule in physiology, when we are studying the meaning of an organ, to ask after its most peculiar andcharacteristic sort of performance, and to seek its office in that one of its functions which no other organ can possiblyexert. Surely the same maxim holds good in our present quest. The essence of religious experiences, the thing bywhich we finally must judge them, must be that element or quality in them which we can meet nowhere else. Andsuch a quality will be of course most prominent and easy to notice in those religious experiences which are most one-sided, exaggerated, and intense.Now when we compare these intenser experiences with the experiences of tamer minds, so cool and reasonable thatwe are tempted to call them philosophical rather than religious, we find a character that is perfectly distinct. Thatcharacter, it seems to me, should be regarded as the practically important differentia of religion for our purpose; andjust what it is can easily be brought out by comparing the mind of an abstractly conceived Christian with that of amoralist similarly conceived.A life is manly, stoical, moral, or philosophical, we say, in proportion as it is less swayed by paltry personalconsiderations and more by objective ends that call for energy, even though that energy bring personal loss and pain.This is the good side of war, in so far as it calls for 'volunteers'. And for morality life is a war, and the service of thehighest is a sort of cosmic patriotism which also calls for volunteers. Even a sick man, unable to be militantoutwardly, can carry on the moral warfare. He can willfully turn his attention away from his own future, whether inthis world or the next. He can train himself to indifference to his present drawbacks and immerse himself in whateverobjective interests still remain accessible. He can follow public news, and sympathize with1Benham's translation: Book III., chaps. xv., lix.

He can cultivate cheerful manners, and be silent about his miseries. He can contemplatewhatever ideal aspects of existence his philosophy is able to present to him, and practice whatever duties, such aspatience, resignation, trust, his ethical system requires. Such a man lives on his loftiest, largest plane. He is a high-hearted freeman and no pining slave. And yet he lacks something which the Christian par excellence, the mystic andascetic saint, for example, has in abundant measure, and which makes of him a human being of an altogether differentdenomination.The Christian also spurns the pinched and mumping sick-room attitude, and the lives of saints are full of a kind ofcallousness to diseased conditions of body which probably no other human records show. But whereas the merelymoralistic spurning takes an effort of volition, the Christian spurning is the result of the excitement of a higher kind ofemotion, in the presence of which no exertion of volition is required. The moralist must hold his breath and keep hismuscles tense; and so long as this athletic attitude is possible all goes well—morality suffices. But the athletic attitudetends ever to break down, and it inevitably does break down even in the most stalwart when the organism begins todecay, or when morbid fears invade the mind. To suggest personal will and effort to one all sicklied o'er with thesense of irremediable impotence is to suggest the most impossible of things. What he craves is to be consoled in hisvery powerlessness, to feel that the spirit of the universe recognizes and secures him, all decaying and failing as he is.Well, we are all such helpless failures in the last resort. The sanest and best of us are of one clay with lunatics andprison inmates, and death finally runs the robustest of us down. And whenever we feel this, such a sense of the vanityand provisionality of our voluntary career comes over us that all our morality appears but as a plaster hiding a sore itcan never cure, and all our well-doing as the hollowest substitute for that well-being that our lives ought to begrounded in, but, alas! are not.And here religion comes to our rescue and takes our fate into her hands. There is a state of mind, known to religiousmen, but to no others, in which the will to assert ourselves and hold our own has been displaced by a willingness toclose"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP50 hl[27 02 2011 00 28 58]Page 50our mouths and be as nothing in the floods and waterspouts of God. In this state of mind, what we most dreaded hasbecome the habitation of our safety, and the hour of our moral death has turned into our spiritual birthday. The timefor tension in our soul is over, and that of happy relaxation, of calm deep breathing, of an eternal present, with nodiscordant future to be anxious about, has arrived. Fear is not held in abeyance as it is by mere morality, it ispositively expunged and washed away.We shall see abundant examples of this happy state of mind in later lectures of this course. We shall see howinfinitely passionate a thing religion at its highest flights can be. Like love, like wrath, like hope, ambition, jealousy,like every other instinctive eagerness and impulse, it adds to life an enchantment which is not rationally or logicallydeducible from anything else. This enchantment, coming as a gift when it does come,—a gift of our organism, thephysiologists will tell us, a gift of God's grace, the theologians say,—is either there or not there for us, and there arepersons who can no more become possessed by it than they can fall in love with a given woman by mere word ofcommand. Religious feeling is thus an absolute addition to the Subject's range of life. It gives him a new sphere ofpower. When the outward battle is lost, and the outer world disowns him, it redeems and vivifies an interior worldwhich otherwise would be an empty waste.If religion is to mean anything definite for us, it seems to me that we ought to take it as meaning this added dimensionof emotion, this enthusiastic temper of espousal, in regions where morality strictly so called can at best but bow itshead and acquiesce. It ought to mean nothing short of this new reach of freedom for us, with the struggle over, thekeynote of the universe sounding in our ears, and everlasting possession spread before our eyes.1This sort of happiness in the absolute and everlasting is what we find nowhere but in religion. It is parted off from all1Once more, there are plenty of men, constitutionally sombre men, in whose religious life this rapturousness is lacking. They arereligious in the wider sense; yet in this acutest of all senses they are not so, and it is religion in the acutest sense that I wish, withoutdisputing about words, to study first, so as to get at its typical differentia."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP51 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 16]Page 51mere animal happiness, all mere enjoyment of the present, by that element of solemnity of which I have already madeso much account. Solemnity is a hard thing to define abstractly, but certain of its marks are patent enough. A solemnstate of mind is never crude or simple—it seems to contain a certain measure of its own opposite in solution. Asolemn joy preserves a sort of bitter in its sweetness; a solemn sorrow is one to which we intimately consent. Butthere are writers who, realizing that happiness of a supreme sort is the prerogative of religion, forget this complication,and call all happiness, as such, religious. Mr. Havelock Ellis, for example, identifies religion with the entire field ofthe soul's liberation from oppressive moods.''The simplest functions of physiological life,\" he writes, \"may be its ministers. Every one who is at all acquainted with the Persianmystics knows how wine may be regarded as an instrument of religion. Indeed, in all countries and in all ages, some form of physicalenlargement—singing, dancing, drinking, sexual excitement—has been intimately associated with worship. Even the momentaryexpansion of the soul in laughter is, to however slight an extent, a religious exercise. Whenever an impulse from the world strikesagainst the organism, and the resultant is not discomfort or pain, not even the muscular contraction of strenuous manhood, but a joyousexpansion or aspiration of the whole soul—there is religion. It is the infinite for which we hunger, and we ride gladly on every little wavethat promises to bear us towards it.\"1But such a straight identification of religion with any and every form of happiness leaves the essential peculiarity ofreligious happiness out. The more commonplace happinesses which we get are 'reliefs,' occasioned by our momentaryescapes from evils either experienced or threatened. But in its most characteristic embodiments, religious happiness isno mere feeling of escape. It cares no longer to escape. It consents to the evil outwardly as a form of sacrifice—inwardly it knows it to be permanently overcome. If you ask how religion1The New Spirit, p. 232."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP52 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 18]Page 52thus falls on the thorns and faces death, and in the very act annuls annihilation, I cannot explain the matter, for it isreligion's secret, and to understand it you must yourself have been a religious man of the extremer type. In our futureexamples, even of the simplest and healthiest-minded type of religious consciousness, we shall find this complexsacrificial constitution, in which a higher happiness holds a lower unhappiness in check. In the Louvre there is apicture, by Guido Reni, of St. Michael with his foot on Satan's neck. The richness of the picture is in large part due tothe fiend's figure being there. The richness of its allegorical meaning also is due to his being there—that is, the worldis all the richer for having a devil in it, so long as we keep our foot upon his neck. In the religious consciousness, thatis just the position in which the fiend, the negative or tragic principle, is found; and for that very reason the religiousconsciousness is so rich from the emotional point of view.1 We shall see how in certain men and women it takes on amonstrously ascetic form. There are saints who have literally fed on the negative principle, on humiliation andprivation, and the thought of suffering and death,—their souls growing in happiness just in proportion as theiroutward state grew more intolerable. No other emotion than religious emotion can bring a man to this peculiar pass.And it is for that reason that when we ask our question about the value of religion for human life, I think we ought tolook for the answer among these violenter examples rather than among those of a more moderate hue.Having the phenomenon of our study in its acutest possible form to start with, we can shade down as much as weplease later. And if in these cases, repulsive as they are to our ordinary worldly way of judging, we find ourselvescompelled to acknowledge religion's value and treat it with respect, it will have proved in some way its value for lifeat large. By subtracting and toning down extravagances we may thereupon proceed to trace the boundaries of itslegitimate sway.To be sure, it makes our task difficult to have to deal so much with eccentricities and extremes. \"How can religion onthe whole be the most important of all human functions,\"1I owe this allegorical illustration to my lamented colleague and friend, Charles Carroll Everett."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP53 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 19]Page 53you may ask, \"if every several manifestation of it in turn have to be corrected and sobered down and pruned away?\"Such a thesis seems a paradox impossible to sustain reasonably,—yet I believe that something like it will have to beour final contention. That personal attitude which the individual finds himself impelled to take up towards what heapprehends to be the divine—and you will remember that this was our definition—will prove to be both a helplessand a sacrificial attitude. That is, we shall have to confess to at least some amount of dependence on sheer mercy, andto practice some amount of renunciation, great or small, to save our souls alive. The constitution of the world we livein requires it:—\"Entbehren sollst du! sollst entbehren!Das ist der ewige GesangDer jedem an die Ohren klingt,Den, unser ganzes Leben langUns heiser jede Stunde singt.\"For when all is said and done, we are in the end absolutely dependent on the universe; and into sacrifices andsurrenders of some sort, deliberately looked at and accepted, we are drawn and pressed as into our only permanentpositions of repose. Now in those states of mind which fall short of religion, the surrender is submitted to as animposition of necessity, and the sacrifice is undergone at the very best without complaint. In the religious life, on thecontrary, surrender and sacrifice are positively espoused: even unnecessary givings-up are added in order that thehappiness may increase. Religion thus makes easy and felicitous what in any case is necessary; and if it be the onlyagency that can accomplish this result, its vital importance as a human faculty stands vindicated beyond dispute. Itbecomes an essential organ of our life, performing a function which no other portion of our nature can so successfullyfulfill. From the merely biological point of view, so to call it, this is a conclusion to which, so far as I can now see,we shall inevitably be led, and led moreover by following the purely empirical method of demonstration which Isketched to you in the first lecture. Of the farther office of religion as a metaphysical revelation I will say nothingnow.But to foreshadow the terminus of one's investigations is"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP54 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 20]Page 54one thing, and to arrive there safely is another. In the next lecture, abandoning the extreme generalities which haveengrossed us hitherto, I propose that we begin our actual journey by addressing ourselves directly to the concrete facts."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP55 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 21]Page 55Lecture IIIThe Reality of the UnseenWere one asked to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say thatit consists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjustingourselves thereto. This belief and this adjustment are the religious attitude in the soul. I wish during this hour to callyour attention to some of the psychological peculiarities of such an attitude as this, of belief in an object which wecannot see. All our attitudes, moral, practical, or emotional, as well as religious, are due to the 'objects' of ourconsciousness, the things which we believe to exist, whether really or ideally, along with ourselves. Such objects maybe present to our senses, or they may be present only to our thought. In either case they elicit from us a reaction; andthe reaction due to things of thought is notoriously in many cases as strong as that due to sensible presences. It may beeven stronger. The memory of an insult may make us angrier than the insult did when we received it. We arefrequently more ashamed of our blunders afterwards than we were at the moment of making them; and in general ourwhole higher prudential and moral life is based on the fact that material sensations actually present may have a weakerinfluence on our action than ideas of remoter facts.The more concrete objects of most men's religion, the deities whom they worship, are known to them only in idea. Ithas been vouchsafed, for example, to very few Christian believers to have had a sensible vision of their Saviour;though enough appearances of this sort are on record, by way of miraculous exception, to merit our attention later.The whole force of the Christian religion, therefore, so far as belief in the divine personages determines the prevalentattitude of the believer, is in general exerted by the instrumentality of pure ideas, of which nothing in the individual'spast experience directly serves as a model.But in addition to these ideas of the more concrete reli-"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP56 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 22]Page 56gious objects, religion is full of abstract objects which prove to have an equal power. God's attributes as such, hisholiness, his justice, his mercy, his absoluteness, his infinity, his omniscience, his tri-unity, the various mysteries ofthe redemptive process, the operation of the sacraments, etc., have proved fertile wells of inspiring meditation forChristian believers.1 We shall see later that the absence of definite sensible images is positively insisted on by themystical authorities in all religions as the sine qua non of a successful orison, or contemplation of the higher divinetruths. Such contemplations are expected (and abundantly verify the expectation, as we shall also see) to influence thebeliever's subsequent attitude very powerfully for good.Immanuel Kant held a curious doctrine about such objects of belief as God, the design of creation, the soul, itsfreedom, and the life hereafter. These things, he said, are properly not objects of knowledge at all. Our conceptionsalways require a sense-content to work with, and as the words 'soul,' 'God,' 'immortality,' cover no distinctive sense-content whatever, it follows that theoretically speaking they are words devoid of any significance. Yet strangelyenough they have a definite meaning for our practice. We can act as if there were a God; feel as if we were free;consider Nature as if she were full of special designs; lay plans as if we were to be immortal; and we find then thatthese words do make a genuine difference in our moral life. Our faith that these unintelligible objects actually existproves thus to be a full equivalent in praktischer Hinsicht, as Kant calls it, or from the point of view of our action, fora knowledge of what they might be, in case we were permitted positively to conceive them. So we have the strangephenomenon, as Kant assures us, of a mind believing with all its strength in the real presence of a set of things of noone of which it can form any notion whatsoever.1Example: \"I have had much comfort lately in meditating on the passages which show the personality of the Holy Ghost, and hisdistinctness from the Father and the Son. It is a subject that requires searching into to find out, but, when realized, gives one so muchmore true and lively a sense of the fullness of the Godhead, and its work in us and to us, than when only thinking of the Spirit in itseffect on us.\" AUGUSTUS HARE: Memorials, i. 244, Maria Hare to Lucy H. Hare."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP57 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 24]Page 57My object in thus recalling Kant's doctrine to your mind is not to express any opinion as to the accuracy of thisparticularly uncouth part of his philosophy, but only to illustrate the characteristic of human nature which we areconsidering, by an example so classical in its exaggeration. The sentiment of reality can indeed attach itself sostrongly to our object of belief that our whole life is polarized through and through, so to speak, by its sense of theexistence of the thing believed in, and yet that thing, for purpose of definite description, can hardly be said to bepresent to our mind at all. It is as if a bar of iron, without touch or sight, with no representative faculty whatever,might nevertheless be strongly endowed with an inner capacity for magnetic feeling; and as if, through the variousarousals of its magnetism by magnets coming and going in its neighborhood, it might be consciously determined todifferent attitudes and tendencies. Such a bar of iron could never give you an outward description of the agencies thathad the power of stirring it so strongly; yet of their presence, and of their significance for its life, it would be intenselyaware through every fibre of its being.It is not only the Ideas of pure Reason, as Kant styled them, that have this power of making us vitally feel presencesthat we are impotent articulately to describe. All sorts of higher abstractions bring with them the same kind ofimpalpable appeal. Remember those passages from Emerson which I read at my last lecture. The whole universe ofconcrete objects, as we know them, swims, not only for such a transcendentalist writer, but for all of us, in a widerand higher universe of abstract ideas, that lend it its significance. As time, space, and the ether soak through all things,so (we feel) do abstract and essential goodness, beauty, strength, significance, justice, soak through all things good,strong, significant, and just.Such ideas, and others equally abstract, form the background for all our facts, the fountain-head of all the possibilitieswe conceive of. They give its 'nature,' as we call it, to every special thing. Everything we know is 'what' it is bysharing in the nature of one of these abstractions. We can never look directly at them, for they are bodiless andfeatureless and footless, but we grasp all other things by their means,"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP58 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 25]Page 58and in handling the real world we should be stricken with helplessness in just so far forth as we might lose thesemental objects, these adjectives and adverbs and predicates and heads of classification and conception.This absolute determinability of our mind by abstractions is one of the cardinal facts in our human constitution.Polarizing and magnetizing us as they do, we turn towards them and from them, we seek them, hold them, hate them,bless them, just as if they were so many concrete beings. And beings they are, beings as real in the realm which theyinhabit as the changing things of sense are in the realm of space.Plato gave so brilliant and impressive a defense of this common human feeling, that the doctrine of the reality ofabstract objects has been known as the platonic theory of ideas ever since. Abstract Beauty, for example, is for Plato aperfectly definite individual being, of which the intellect is aware as of something additional to all the perishingbeauties of the earth. \"The true order of going,\" he says, in the often quoted passage in his 'Banquet,' \"is to use thebeauties of earth as steps along which one mounts upwards for the sake of that other Beauty, going from one to two,and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions, until from fairnotions he arrives at the notion of absolute Beauty, and at last knows what the essence of Beauty is.\"1 In our lastlecture we had a glimpse of the way in which a platonizing writer like Emerson may treat the abstract divineness ofthings, the moral structure of the universe, as a fact worthy of worship. In those various churches without a Godwhich to-day are spreading through the world under the name of ethical societies, we have a similar worship of theabstract divine, the moral law believed in as an ultimate object. 'Science' in many minds is genuinely taking the placeof a religion. Where this is so, the scientist treats the 'Laws of Nature' as objective facts to be revered. A brilliantschool of interpretation of Greek mythology would have it that in their origin the Greek gods were only half-metaphoric personifications of those great spheres of abstract law and order into which the natural world falls apart—the sky-sphere, the1Symposium, Jowett, 1871, i. 527."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP59 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 26]Page 59ocean-sphere, the earth-sphere, and the like; just as even now we may speak of the smile of the morning, the kiss ofthe breeze, or the bite of the cold, without really meaning that these phenomena of nature actually wear a human face.1As regards the origin of the Greek gods, we need not at present seek an opinion. But the whole array of our instancesleads to a conclusion something like this: It is as if there were in the human consciousness a sense of reality, a feelingof objective presence, a perception of what we may call 'something there,' more deep and more general than any ofthe special and particular 'senses' by which the current psychology supposes existent realities to be originally revealed.If this were so, we might suppose the senses to waken our attitudes and conduct as they so habitually do, by firstexciting this sense of reality; but anything else, any idea, for example, that might similarly excite it, would have thatsame prerogative of appearing real which objects of sense normally possess. So far as religious conceptions were ableto touch this reality-feeling, they would be believed in in spite of criticism, even though they might be so vague andremote as to be almost unimaginable, even though they might be such non-entities in point of whatness as Kantmakes the objects of his moral theology to be.The most curious proofs of the existence of such an undifferentiated sense of reality as this are found in experiencesof hallucination. It often happens that an hallucination is imperfectly developed: the person affected will feel a'presence' in the room, definitely localized, facing in one particular way, real in the most emphatic sense of the word,often coming suddenly, and as suddenly gone; and yet neither seen, heard, touched, nor cognized in any of the usual'sensible' ways. Let me give you an example of this, before I pass to the objects with whose presence religion is morepeculiarly concerned.An intimate friend of mine, one of the keenest intellects I know, has had several experiences of this sort. He writes asfollows in response to my inquiries:—\"I have several times within the past few years felt the1Example: \"Nature is always so interesting, under whatever aspect she shows herself, that when it rains, I seem to see a beautiful womanweeping. She appears the more beautiful, the more afflicted she is.\" B. de St. Pierre."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP60 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 28]Page 60so-called 'consciousness of a presence.' The experiences which I have in mind are clearly distinguishable from another kind ofexperience which I have had very frequently, and which I fancy many persons would also call the 'consciousness of a presence.' But thedifference for me between the two sets of experience is as great as the difference between feeling a slight warmth originating I know notwhere, and standing in the midst of a conflagration with all the ordinary senses alert.\"It was about September, 1884, when I had the first experience. On the previous night I had had, after getting into bed at my rooms inCollege, a vivid tactile hallucination of being grasped by the arm, which made me get up and search the room for an intruder; but thesense of presence properly so called came on the next night. After I had got into bed and blown out the candle, I lay awake awhilethinking on the previous night's experience, when suddenly I felt something come into the room and stay close to my bed. It remainedonly a minute or two. I did not recognize it by any ordinary sense, and yet there was a horribly unpleasant 'sensation' connected with it. Itstirred something more at the roots of my being than any ordinary perception. The feeling had something of the quality of a very largetearing vital pain spreading chiefly over the chest, but within the organism—and yet the feeling was not pain so much as abhorrence. Atall events, something was present with me, and I knew its presence far more surely than I have ever known the presence of any fleshlyliving creature. I was conscious of its departure as of its coming: an almost instantaneously swift going through the door, and the'horrible sensation' disappeared.\"On the third night when I retired my mind was absorbed in some lectures which I was preparing, and I was still absorbed in these whenI became aware of the actual presence (though not of the coming) of the thing that was there the night before, and of the 'horriblesensation.' I then mentally concentrated all my effort to charge this 'thing,' if it was evil, to depart, if it was not evil, to tell me who orwhat it was, and if it could not explain itself, to go, and that I would compel it to go. It went as on the"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP61 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 29]Page 61previous night, and my body quickly recovered its normal state.''On two other occasions in my life I have had precisely the same 'horrible sensation.' Once it lasted a full quarter of an hour. In all threeinstances the certainty that there in outward space there stood something was indescribably stronger than the ordinary certainty ofcompanionship when we are in the close presence of ordinary living people. The something seemed close to me, and intensely more realthan any ordinary perception. Although I felt it to be like unto myself, so to speak, or finite, small, and distressful, as it were, I did n'trecognize it as any individual being or person.\"Of course such an experience as this does not connect itself with the religious sphere. Yet it may upon occasion do so;and the same correspondent informs me that at more than one other conjuncture he had the sense of presencedeveloped with equal intensity and abruptness, only then it was filled with a quality of joy.\"There was not a mere consciousness of something there, but fused in the central happiness of it, a startling awareness of some ineffablegood. Not vague either, not like the emotional effect of some poem, or scene, or blossom, of music, but the sure knowledge of the closepresence of a sort of mighty person, and after it went, the memory persisted as the one perception of reality. Everything else might be adream, but not that.\"My friend, as it oddly happens, does not interpret these latter experiences theistically, as signifying the presence ofGod. But it would clearly not have been unnatural to interpret them as a revelation of the deity's existence. When wereach the subject of mysticism, we shall have much more to say upon this head.Lest the oddity of these phenomena should disconcert you, I will venture to read you a couple of similar narratives,much shorter, merely to show that we are dealing with a well-marked natural kind of fact. In the first case, which Itake from the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research, the"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP62 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 30]Page 62sense of presence developed in a few moments into a distinctly visualized hallucination,—but I leave that part of thestory out.\"I had read,\" the narrator says, \"some twenty minutes or so, was thoroughly absorbed in the book, my mind was perfectly quiet, and forthe time being my friends were quite forgotten, when suddenly without a moment's warning my whole being seemed roused to thehighest state of tension or aliveness, and I was aware, with an intenseness not easily imagined by those who had never experienced it,that another being or presence was not only in the room, but quite close to me. I put my book down, and although my excitement wasgreat, I felt quite collected, and not conscious of any sense of fear. Without changing my position, and looking straight at the fire, I knewsomehow that my friend A. H. was standing at my left elbow, but so far behind me as to be hidden by the armchair in which I wasleaning back. Moving my eyes round slightly without otherwise changing my position, the lower portion of one leg became visible, and Iinstantly recognized the gray-blue material of trousers he often wore, but the stuff appeared semi-transparent, reminding me of tobaccosmoke in consistency,\"1—and hereupon the visual hallucination came.Another informant writes:—\"Quite early in the night I was awakened. I felt as if I had been aroused intentionally, and at first thought some one was breaking intothe house. I then turned on my side to go to sleep again, and immediately felt a consciousness of a presence in the room, and singular tostate, it was not the consciousness of a live person, but of a spiritual presence. This may provoke a smile, but I can only tell you the factsas they occurred to me. I do not know how to better describe my sensations than by simply stating that I felt a consciousness of aspiritual presence. I felt also at the same time a strong feeling of superstitious dread, as if something strange and fearful were about tohappen.\"21Journal of the S. P. R., February, 1895, p. 26.2E.

It is sometimes so definitely characterized that I could point to its exact position. This impressionof presence is impossible to describe. It varies in intensity and clearness according to the personality from whom the writing professes tocome. If it is some one whom I love, I feel it immediately, before any writing has come. My heart seems to recognize it.\"In an earlier book of mine I have cited at full length a curious case of presence felt by a blind man. The presence wasthat of the figure of a gray-bearded man dressed in a pepper and salt suit, squeezing himself under the crack of thedoor and moving across the floor of the room towards a sofa. The blind subject of this quasi-hallucination is anexceptionally intelligent reporter. He is entirely without internal visual imagery and cannot represent light or colors tohimself, and is positive that his other senses, hearing, etc., were not involved in this false perception. It seems to havebeen an abstract conception rather, with the feelings of reality and spatial outwardness directly attached to it—in otherwords, a fully objectified and exteriorized idea.Such cases, taken along with others which would be too tedious for quotation, seem sufficiently to prove the existencein our mental machinery of a sense of present reality more diffused and general than that which our special sensesyield. For the psychologists the tracing of the organic seat of such a feeling would form a pretty problem—nothingcould be more natural than to connect it with the muscular sense, with the feeling that our muscles were innervatingthemselves for action. Whatsoever thus innervated our activity, or 'made our flesh creep,'—our senses are what do sooftenest,—might then appear real and present, even though it were but an abstract idea.

It seems to me as if I haveloved and suffered and that erelong I shall die, in a dream. My last word will be, 'I have been dreaming.'\"1In another lecture we shall see how in morbid melancholy this sense of the unreality of things may become a carkingpain, and even lead to suicide.We may now lay it down as certain that in the distinctively religious sphere of experience, many persons (how manywe cannot tell) possess the objects of their belief, not in the form of mere conceptions which their intellect accepts astrue, but rather in the form of quasi-sensible realities directly apprehended. As his sense of the real presence of theseobjects fluctuates, so the believer alternates between warmth and coldness in his faith. Other examples will bring thishome to one better than abstract description, so I proceed immediately to cite some. The first example is a negativeone, deploring the loss of the sense in question. I have extracted it from an account given me by a scientific man ofmy acquaintance, of his religious life. It seems to me to show clearly that the feeling of reality may be somethingmore like a sensation than an intellectual operation properly so-called.\"Between twenty and thirty I gradually became more and more agnostic and irreligious, yet I cannot say that I ever lost that 'indefiniteconsciousness' which Herbert Spencer describes so well, of an Absolute Reality behind phe-1Pensées d'un Solitaire, p. 66."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP65 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 34]Page 65nomena. For me this Reality was not the pure Unknowable of Spencer's philosophy, for although I had ceased my childish prayers toGod, and never prayed to It in a formal manner, yet my more recent experience shows me to have been in a relation to It whichpractically was the same thing as prayer. Whenever I had any trouble, especially when I had conflict with other people, eitherdomestically or in the way of business, or when I was depressed in spirits or anxious about affairs, I now recognize that I used to fallback for support upon this curious relation I felt myself to be in to this fundamental cosmical It. It was on my side, or I was on Its side,however you please to term it, in the particular trouble, and it always strengthened me and seemed to give me endless vitality to feel itsunderlying and supporting presence. In fact, it was an unfailing fountain of living justice, truth, and strength, to which I instinctivelyturned at times of weakness, and it always brought me out. I know now that it was a personal relation I was in to it, because of late yearsthe power of communicating with it has left me, and I am conscious of a perfectly definite loss. I used never to fail to find it when Iturned to it. Then came a set of years when sometimes I found it, and then again I would be wholly unable to make connection with it. Iremember many occasions on which at night in bed, I would be unable to get to sleep on account of worry. I turned this way and that inthe darkness, and groped mentally for the familiar sense of that higher mind of my mind which had always seemed to be close at hand asit were, closing the passage, and yielding support, but there was no electric current. A blank was there instead of It: I could n't findanything. Now, at the age of nearly fifty, my power of getting into connection with it has entirely left me; and I have to confess that agreat help has gone out of my life. Life has become curiously dead and indifferent; and I can now see that my old experience wasprobably exactly the same thing as the prayers of the orthodox, only I did not call them by that name. What I have spoken of as 'It' waspractically not Spencer's Unknowable, but just my own instinctive and individual God, whom I relied upon for higher sympathy, butwhom somehow I have lost.\""},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP66 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 52]Page 66Nothing is more common in the pages of religious biography than the way in which seasons of lively and of difficultfaith are described as alternating. Probably every religious person has the recollection of particular crises in which adirecter vision of the truth, a direct perception, perhaps, of a living God's existence, swept in and overwhelmed thelanguor of the more ordinary belief. In James Russell Lowell's correspondence there is a brief memorandum of anexperience of this kind:—\"I had a revelation last Friday evening. I was at Mary's, and happening to say something of the presence of spirits (of whom, I said, I wasoften dimly aware), Mr. Putnam entered into an argument with me on spiritual matters. As I was speaking, the whole system rose upbefore me like a vague destiny looming from the Abyss. I never before so clearly felt the Spirit of God in me and around me. The wholeroom seemed to me full of God. The air seemed to waver to and fro with the presence of Something I knew not what. I spoke with thecalmness and clearness of a prophet. I cannot tell you what this revelation was. I have not yet studied it enough. But I shall perfect it oneday, and then you shall hear it and acknowledge its grandeur.\"1Here is a longer and more developed experience from a manuscript communication by a clergyman,—I take it fromStarbuck's manuscript collection:—\"I remember the night, and almost the very spot on the hilltop, where my soul opened out, as it were, into the Infinite, and there was arushing together of the two worlds, the inner and the outer. It was deep calling unto deep,—the deep that my own struggle had opened upwithin being answered by the unfathomable deep without, reaching beyond the stars. I stood alone with Him who had made me, and allthe beauty of the world, and love, and sorrow, and even temptation. I did not seek Him, but felt the perfect unison of my spirit with His.The ordinary sense of things around me faded. For the moment nothing but an ineffable joy and exaltation remained. It is impossiblefully to1Letters of Lowell, i. 75."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP67 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 53]Page 67describe the experience. It was like the effect of some great orchestra when all the separate notes have melted into one swelling harmonythat leaves the listener conscious of nothing save that his soul is being wafted upwards, and almost bursting with its own emotion. Theperfect stillness of the night was thrilled by a more solemn silence. The darkness held a presence that was all the more felt because it wasnot seen. I could not any more have doubted that He was there than that I was. Indeed, I felt myself to be, if possible, the less real of thetwo.\"My highest faith in God and truest idea of him were then born in me. I have stood upon the Mount of Vision since, and felt the Eternalround about me. But never since has there come quite the same stirring of the heart. Then, if ever, I believe, I stood face to face withGod, and was born anew of his spirit. There was, as I recall it, no sudden change of thought or of belief, except that my early crudeconception had, as it were, burst into flower. There was no destruction of the old, but a rapid, wonderful unfolding. Since that time nodiscussion that I have heard of the proofs of God's existence has been able to shake my faith. Having once felt the presence of God'sspirit, I have never lost it again for long. My most assuring evidence of his existence is deeply rooted in that hour of vision, in thememory of that supreme experience, and in the conviction, gained from reading and reflection, that something the same has come to allwho have found God. I am aware that it may justly be called mystical. I am not enough acquainted with philosophy to defend it fromthat or any other charge. I feel that in writing of it I have overlaid it with words rather than put it clearly to your thought. But, such as itis, I have described it as carefully as I now am able to do.\"Here is another document, even more definite in character, which, the writer being a Swiss, I translate from theFrench original.1\"I was in perfect health: we were on our sixth day of1I borrow it, with Professor Flournoy's permission, from his rich collection of psychological documents."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP68 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 55]Page 68tramping, and in good training. We had come the day before from Sixt to Trient by Buet. I felt neither fatigue, hunger, nor thirst, and mystate of mind was equally healthy. I had had at Forclaz good news from home; I was subject to no anxiety, either near or remote, for wehad a good guide, and there was not a shadow of uncertainty about the road we should follow. I can best describe the condition in whichI was by calling it a state of equilibrium. When all at once I experienced a feeling of being raised above myself, I felt the presence ofGod—I tell of the thing just as I was conscious of it—as if his goodness and his power were penetrating me altogether. The throb ofemotion was so violent that I could barely tell the boys to pass on and not wait for me. I then sat down on a stone, unable to stand anylonger, and my eyes overflowed with tears. I thanked God that in the course of my life he had taught me to know him, that he sustainedmy life and took pity both on the insignificant creature and on the sinner that I was. I begged him ardently that my life might beconsecrated to the doing of his will. I felt his reply, which was that I should do his will from day to day, in humility and poverty, leavinghim, the Almighty God, to be judge of whether I should some time be called to bear witness more conspicuously. Then, slowly, theecstasy left my heart; that is, I felt that God had withdrawn the communion which he had granted, and I was able to walk on, but veryslowly, so strongly was I still possessed by the interior emotion. Besides, I had wept uninterruptedly for several minutes, my eyes wereswollen, and I did not wish my companions to see me. The state of ecstasy may have lasted four or five minutes, although it seemed atthe time to last much longer. My comrades waited for me ten minutes at the cross of Barine, but I took about twenty-five or thirtyminutes to join them, for as well as I can remember, they said that I had kept them back for about half an hour. The impression had beenso profound that in climbing slowly the slope I asked myself if it were possible that Moses on Sinai could have had a more intimatecommunication with God. I think it well to add that in this ecstasy of mine God had neither form, color, odor, nor taste; moreover, thatthe feeling of his presence"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP69 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 56]Page 69was accompanied with no determinate localization. It was rather as if my personality had been transformed by the presence of a spiritualspirit. But the more I seek words to express this intimate intercourse, the more I feel the impossibility of describing the thing by any ofour usual images. At bottom the expression most apt to render what I felt is this: God was present, though invisible; he fell under no oneof my senses, yet my consciousness perceived him.\"The adjective 'mystical' is technically applied, most often, to states that are of brief duration. Of course such hours ofrapture as the last two persons describe are mystical experiences, of which in a later lecture I shall have much to say.Meanwhile here is the abridged record of another mystical or semi-mystical experience, in a mind evidently framed bynature for ardent piety. I owe it to Starbuck's collection. The lady who gives the account is the daughter of a man wellknown in his time as a writer against Christianity. The suddenness of her conversion shows well how native the senseof God's presence must be to certain minds. She relates that she was brought up in entire ignorance of Christiandoctrine, but, when in Germany, after being talked to by Christian friends, she read the Bible and prayed, and finallythe plan of salvation flashed upon her like a stream of light.\"To this day,\" she writes, \"I cannot understand dallying with religion and the commands of God. The very instant I heard my Father's crycalling unto me, my heart bounded in recognition. I ran, I stretched forth my arms, I cried aloud, 'Here, here I am, my Father.' Oh, happychild, what should I do? 'Love me,' answered my God. 'I do, I do,' I cried passionately. 'Come unto me,' called my Father. 'I will,' myheart panted. Did I stop to ask a single question? Not one. It never occurred to me to ask whether I was good enough, or to hesitate overmy unfitness, or to find out what I thought of his church, or to wait until I should be satisfied. Satisfied! I was satisfied. Had I not foundmy God and my Father? Did he not love me? Had he not called me? Was there not a Church into which I might enter? Since then Ihave had direct answers to prayer—so significant as to be almost like talking with God"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP70 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 57]Page 70and hearing his answer. The idea of God's reality has never left me for one moment.\"Here is still another case, the writer being a man aged twenty-seven, in which the experience, probably almost ascharacteristic, is less vividly described:—\"I have on a number of occasions felt that I had enjoyed a period of intimate communion with the divine. These meetings came unaskedand unexpected, and seemed to consist merely in the temporary obliteration of the conventionalities which usually surround and cover mylife. Once it was when from the summit of a high mountain I looked over a gashed and corrugated landscape extending to a longconvex of ocean that ascended to the horizon, and again from the same point when I could see nothing beneath me but a boundlessexpanse of white cloud, on the blown surface of which a few high peaks, including the one I was on, seemed plunging about as if theywere dragging their anchors. What I felt on these occasions was a temporary loss of my own identity, accompanied by an illuminationwhich revealed to me a deeper significance than I had been wont to attach to life. It is in this that I find my justification for saying that Ihave enjoyed communication with God. Of course the absence of such a being as this would be chaos. I cannot conceive of life withoutits presence.\"Of the more habitual and so to speak chronic sense of God's presence the following sample from Professor Starbuck'smanuscript collection may serve to give an idea. It is from a man aged forty-nine,—probably thousands ofunpretending Christians would write an almost identical account.\"God is more real to me than any thought or thing or person. I feel his presence positively, and the more as I live in closer harmony withhis laws as written in my body and mind. I feel him in the sunshine or rain; and awe mingled with a delicious restfulness most nearlydescribes my feelings. I talk to him as to a companion in prayer and praise, and our communion is delightful. He answers me again andagain, often in words so clearly spoken that it seems"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP71 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 58]Page 71my outer ear must have carried the tone, but generally in strong mental impressions. Usually a text of Scripture, unfolding some newview of him and his love for me, and care for my safety. I could give hundreds of instances, in school matters, social problems, financialdifficulties, etc. That he is mine and I am his never leaves me, it is an abiding joy. Without it life would be a blank, a desert, a shoreless,trackless waste.''I subjoin some more examples from writers of different ages and sexes. They are also from Professor Starbuck'scollection, and their number might be greatly multiplied. The first is from a man twenty-seven years old:—\"God is quite real to me. I talk to him and often get answers. Thoughts sudden and distinct from any I have been entertaining come tomy mind after asking God for his direction. Something over a year ago I was for some weeks in the direst perplexity. When the troublefirst appeared before me I was dazed, but before long (two or three hours) I could hear distinctly a passage of Scripture: 'My grace issufficient for thee.' Every time my thoughts turned to the trouble I could hear this quotation. I don't think I ever doubted the existence ofGod, or had him drop out of my consciousness. God has frequently stepped into my affairs very perceptibly, and I feel that he directsmany little details all the time. But on two or three occasions he has ordered ways for me very contrary to my ambitions and plans.\"Another statement (none the less valuable psychologically for being so decidedly childish) is that of a boy ofseventeen:—\"Sometimes as I go to church, I sit down, join in the service, and before I go out I feel as if God was with me, right side of me, singingand reading the Psalms with me. And then again I feel as if I could sit beside him, and put my arms around him, kiss him, etc. When Iam taking Holy Communion at the altar, I try to get with him and generally feel his presence.\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP72 hl[27 02 2011 00 29 59]Page 72I let a few other cases follow at random:—\"God surrounds me like the physical atmosphere. He is closer to me than my own breath. In him literally I live and move and have mybeing.\"—\"There are times when I seem to stand in his very presence, to talk with him. Answers to prayer have come, sometimes direct andoverwhelming in their revelation of his presence and powers. There are times when God seems far off, but this is always my ownfault.\"—\"I have the sense of a presence, strong, and at the same time soothing, which hovers over me. Sometimes it seems to enwrap me withsustaining arms.\"Such is the human ontological imagination, and such is the convincingness of what it brings to birth. Unpicturablebeings are realized, and realized with an intensity almost like that of an hallucination. They determine our vitalattitude as decisively as the vital attitude of lovers is determined by the habitual sense, by which each is haunted, ofthe other being in the world. A lover has notoriously this sense of the continuous being of his idol, even when hisattention is addressed to other matters and he no longer represents her features. He cannot forget her; sheuninterruptedly affects him through and through.I spoke of the convincingness of these feelings of reality, and I must dwell a moment longer on that point. They are asconvincing to those who have them as any direct sensible experiences can be, and they are, as a rule, much moreconvincing than results established by mere logic ever are. One may indeed be entirely without them; probably morethan one of you here present is without them in any marked degree; but if you do have them, and have them at allstrongly, the probability is that you cannot help regarding them as genuine perceptions of truth, as revelations of akind of reality which no adverse argument, however unanswerable by you in words, can expel from your belief. Theopinion opposed to mysticism in philosophy is sometimes spoken of as rationalism. Rationalism insists that all ourbeliefs ought ultimately to find for themselves articulate grounds. Such grounds, for rationalism, must consist of fourthings: (1) definitely statable abstract"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP73 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 01]Page 73principles; (2) definite facts of sensation; (3) definite hypotheses based on such facts; and (4) definite inferenceslogically drawn. Vague impressions of something indefinable have no place in the rationalistic system, which on itspositive side is surely a splendid intellectual tendency, for not only are all our philosophies fruits of it, but physicalscience (amongst other good things) is its result.Nevertheless, if we look on man's whole mental life as it exists, on the life of men that lies in them apart from theirlearning and science, and that they inwardly and privately follow, we have to confess that the part of it of whichrationalism can give an account is relatively superficial. It is the part that has the prestige undoubtedly, for it has theloquacity, it can challenge you for proofs, and chop logic, and put you down with words. But it will fail to convince orconvert you all the same, if your dumb intuitions are opposed to its conclusions. If you have intuitions at all, theycome from a deeper level of your nature than the loquacious level which rationalism inhabits. Your wholesubconscious life, your impulses, your faiths, your needs, your divinations, have prepared the premises, of which yourconsciousness now feels the weight of the result; and something in you absolutely knows that that result must be truerthan any logic-chopping rationalistic talk, however clever, that may contradict it. This inferiority of the rationalisticlevel in founding belief is just as manifest when rationalism argues for religion as when it argues against it. That vastliterature of proofs of God's existence drawn from the order of nature, which a century ago seemed so overwhelminglyconvincing, to-day does little more than gather dust in libraries, for the simple reason that our generation has ceased tobelieve in the kind of God it argued for. Whatever sort of a being God may be, we know to-day that he is nevermorethat mere external inventor of 'contrivances' intended to make manifest his 'glory' in which our great-grandfathers tooksuch satisfaction, though just how we know this we cannot possibly make clear by words either to others or toourselves. I defy any of you here fully to account for your persuasion that if a God exist he must be a more cosmicand tragic personage than that Being.The truth is that in the metaphysical and religious sphere,"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP74 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 02]Page 74articulate reasons are cogent for us only when our inarticulate feelings of reality have already been impressed in favorof the same conclusion. Then, indeed, our intuitions and our reason work together, and great world-ruling systems,like that of the Buddhist or of the Catholic philosophy, may grow up. Our impulsive belief is here always what sets upthe original body of truth, and our philosophy is but its showy verbalized translation. The immediate assurance is thedeep thing in us, the argument is but a surface exhibition. Instinct leads, intelligence does but follow. If a person feelsthe presence of a living God after the fashion shown by my quotations, your critical arguments, be they never sosuperior, will vainly set themselves to change his faith.Please observe, however, that I do not yet say that it is better that the subconscious and non-rational should thus holdprimacy in the religious realm. I confine myself to simply pointing out that they do so hold it as a matter of fact.So much for our sense of the reality of the religious objects. Let me now say a brief word more about the attitudesthey characteristically awaken.We have already agreed that they are solemn; and we have seen reason to think that the most distinctive of them is thesort of joy which may result in extreme cases from absolute self-surrender. The sense of the kind of object to whichthe surrender is made has much to do with determining the precise complexion of the joy; and the whole phenomenonis more complex than any simple formula allows. In the literature of the subject, sadness and gladness have each beenemphasized in turn. The ancient saying that the first maker of the Gods was fear receives voluminous corroborationfrom every age of religious history; but none the less does religious history show the part which joy has evermoretended to play. Sometimes the joy has been primary; sometimes secondary, being the gladness of deliverance from thefear. This latter state of things, being the more complex, is also the more complete; and as we proceed, I think weshall have abundant reason for refusing to leave out either the sadness or the gladness, if we look at religion with thebreadth of view which it demands. Stated in the completest possible terms, a man's religion involves both moods ofcontraction and moods of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP75 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 03]Page 75expansion of his being. But the quantitative mixture and order of these moods vary so much from one age of theworld, from one system of thought, and from one individual to another, that you may insist either on the dread and thesubmission, or on the peace and the freedom as the essence of the matter, and still remain materially within the limitsof the truth. The constitutionally sombre and the constitutionally sanguine onlooker are bound to emphasize oppositeaspects of what lies before their eyes.The constitutionally sombre religious person makes even of his religious peace a very sober thing. Danger still hoversin the air about it. Flexion and contraction are not wholly checked. It were sparrowlike and childish after ourdeliverance to explode into twittering laughter and caper-cutting, and utterly to forget the imminent hawk on bough.Lie low, rather, lie low; for you are in the hands of a living God. In the Book of Job, for example, the impotence ofman and the omnipotence of God is the exclusive burden of its author's mind. \"It is as high as heaven; what canst thoudo?—deeper than hell; what canst thou know?\" There is an astringent relish about the truth of this conviction whichsome men can feel, and which for them is as near an approach as can be made to the feeling of religious joy.\"In Job,\" says that coldly truthful writer, the author of Mark Rutherford, \"God reminds us that man is not the measure of his creation.The world is immense, constructed on no plan or theory which the intellect of man can grasp. It is transcendent everywhere. This is theburden of every verse, and is the secret, if there be one, of the poem. Sufficient or insufficient, there is nothing more. God is great, weknow not his ways. He takes from us all we have, but yet if we possess our souls in patience, we may pass the valley of the shadow, andcome out in sunlight again. We may or we may not! What more have we to say now than God said from the whirlwind over twothousand five hundred years ago?\"1If we turn to the sanguine onlooker, on the other hand, we1Mark Rutherford's Deliverance, London, 1885, pp. 196, 198."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP76 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 05]Page 76find that deliverance is felt as incomplete unless the burden be altogether overcome and the danger forgotten. Suchonlookers give us definitions that seem to the sombre minds of whom we have just been speaking to leave out all thesolemnity that makes religious peace so different from merely animal joys. In the opinion of some writers an attitudemight be called religious, though no touch were left in it of sacrifice or submission, no tendency to flexion, no bowingof the head. Any \"habitual and regulated admiration,\" says Professor J. R. Seeley,1 \"is worthy to be called a religion\";and accordingly he thinks that our Music, our Science, and our so-called 'Civilization,' as these things are noworganized and admiringly believed in, form the more genuine religions of our time. Certainly the unhesitating andunreasoning way in which we feel that we must inflict our Civilization upon 'lower' races, by means of Hotchkissguns, etc., reminds one of nothing so much as of the early spirit of Islam spreading its religion by the sword.In my last lecture I quoted to you the ultra-radical opinion of Mr. Havelock Ellis, that laughter of any sort may beconsidered a religious exercise, for it bears witness to the soul's emancipation. I quoted this opinion in order to denyits adequacy. But we must now settle our scores more carefully with this whole optimistic way of thinking. It is fartoo complex to be decided off-hand. I propose accordingly that we make of religious optimism the theme of the nexttwo lectures.1In his book (too little read, I fear), Natural Religion, 3d edition, Boston, 1886, pp. 91, 122."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP77 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 06]Page 77Lectures IV and VThe Religion of Healthy-MindednessIf we were to ask the question: 'What is human life's chief concern?' one of the answers we should receive would be:'It is happiness.' How to gain, how to keep, how to recover happiness, is in fact for most men at all times the secretmotive of all they do, and of all they are willing to endure. The hedonistic school in ethics deduces the moral lifewholly from the experiences of happiness and unhappiness which different kinds of conduct bring; and, even more inthe religious life than in the moral life, happiness and unhappiness seem to be the poles round which the interestrevolves. We need not go so far as to say with the author whom I lately quoted that any persistent enthusiasm is, assuch, religion, nor need we call mere laughter a religious exercise; but we must admit that any persistent enjoymentmay produce the sort of religion which consists in a grateful admiration of the gift of so happy an existence; and wemust also acknowledge that the more complex ways of experiencing religion are new manners of producing happiness,wonderful inner paths to a supernatural kind of happiness, when the first gift of natural existence is unhappy, as it sooften proves itself to be.With such relations between religion and happiness, it is perhaps not surprising that men come to regard the happinesswhich a religious belief affords as a proof of its truth. If a creed makes a man feel happy, he almost inevitably adoptsit. Such a belief ought to be true; therefore it is true—such, rightly or wrongly, is one of the 'immediate inferences' ofthe religious logic used by ordinary men.\"The near presence of God's spirit,\" says a German writer,1 \"may be experienced in its reality—indeed only experienced.

No other proof is equally convincing, and therefore happiness is the point from which every efficacious newtheology should start.\"In the hour immediately before us, I shall invite you to consider the simpler kinds of religious happiness, leaving themore complex sorts to be treated on a later day.In many persons, happiness is congenital and irreclaimable. 'Cosmic emotion' inevitably takes in them the form ofenthusiasm and freedom. I speak not only of those who are animally happy. I mean those who, when unhappiness isoffered or proposed to them, positively refuse to feel it, as if it were something mean and wrong. We find suchpersons in every age, passionately flinging themselves upon their sense of the goodness of life, in spite of thehardships of their own condition, and in spite of the sinister theologies into which they may be born. From the outsettheir religion is one of union with the divine. The heretics who went before the reformation are lavishly accused by thechurch writers of antinomian practices, just as the first Christians were accused of indulgence in orgies by theRomans. It is probable that there never has been a century in which the deliberate refusal to think ill of life has notbeen idealized by a sufficient number of persons to form sects, open or secret, who claimed all natural things to bepermitted. Saint Augustine's maxim, Dilige et quod vis fac,—if you but love [God], you may do as you incline,—ismorally one of the profoundest of observations, yet it is pregnant, for such persons, with passports beyond the boundsof conventional morality. According to their characters they have been refined or gross; but their belief has been at alltimes systematic enough to constitute a definite religious attitude. God was for them a giver of freedom, and the stingof evil was overcome. Saint Francis and his immediate disciples were, on the whole, of this company of spirits, ofwhich there are of course infinite varieties. Rousseau in the earlier years of his writing, Diderot, B. de Saint Pierre,and many of the leaders of the eighteenth century anti-christian movement"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP79 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 09]Page 79were of this optimistic type. They owed their influence to a certain authoritativeness in their feeling that Nature, if youwill only trust her sufficiently, is absolutely good.It is to be hoped that we all have some friend, perhaps more often feminine than masculine, and young than old, whosesoul is of this sky-blue tint, whose affinities are rather with flowers and birds and all enchanting innocencies than withdark human passions, who can think no ill of man or God, and in whom religious gladness, being in possession fromthe outset, needs no deliverance from any antecedent burden.\"God has two families of children on this earth,\" says Francis W. Newman,1 \"the once-born and the twice-born,\" and the once-born hedescribes as follows: \"They see God, not as a strict Judge, not as a Glorious Potentate; but as the animating Spirit of a beautifulharmonious world, Beneficent and Kind, Merciful as well as Pure. The same characters generally have no metaphysical tendencies: theydo not look back into themselves. Hence they are not distressed by their own imperfections: yet it would be absurd to call them self-righteous; for they hardly think of themselves at all. This childlike quality of their nature makes the opening of religion very happy tothem: for they no more shrink from God, than a child from an emperor, before whom the parent trembles: in fact, they have no vividconception of any of the qualities in which the severer Majesty of God consists.2 He is to them the impersonation of Kindness andBeauty. They read his character, not in the disordered world of man, but in romantic and harmonious nature. Of human sin they knowperhaps little in their own hearts and not very much in the world; and human suffering does but melt them to tenderness. Thus, whenthey approach God, no inward disturbance ensues; and without being as yet spiritual, they have a certain complacency and perhapsromantic sense of excitement in their simple worship.\"1The Soul; its Sorrows and its Aspirations, 3d edition, 1852, pp. 89, 91.2I once heard a lady describe the pleasure it gave her to think that she \"could always cuddle up to God.\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP80 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 10]Page 80In the Romish Church such characters find a more congenial soil to grow in than in Protestantism, whose fashions offeeling have been set by minds of a decidedly pessimistic order. But even in Protestantism they have been abundantenough; and in its recent 'liberal' developments of Unitarianism and latitudinarianism generally, minds of this orderhave played and still are playing leading and constructive parts. Emerson himself is an admirable example. TheodoreParker is another,—here are a couple of characteristic passages from Parker's correspondence.1\"Orthodox scholars say: 'In the heathen classics you find no consciousness of sin.' It is very true—God be thanked for it. They wereconscious of wrath, of cruelty, avarice, drunkenness, lust, sloth, cowardice, and other actual vices, and struggled and got rid of thedeformities, but they were not conscious of 'enmity against God,' and did n't sit down and whine and groan against non-existent evil. Ihave done wrong things enough in my life, and do them now; I miss the mark, draw bow, and try again. But I am not conscious of hatingGod, or man, or right, or love, and I know there is much 'health in me'; and in my body, even now, there dwelleth many a good thing,spite of consumption and Saint Paul.\" In another letter Parker writes: \"I have swum in clear sweet waters all my days; and if sometimesthey were a little cold, and the stream ran adverse and something rough, it was never too strong to be breasted and swum through. Fromthe days of earliest boyhood, when I went stumbling through the grass, up to the gray-bearded manhood of this time, there is none buthas left me honey in the hive of memory that I now feed on for present delight. When I recall the years I am filled with a sense ofsweetness and wonder that such little things can make a mortal so exceedingly rich. But I must confess that the chiefest of all my delightsis still the religious.\"Another good expression of the 'once-born' type of con-1JOHN WEISS: Life of Theodore Parker, i. 152, 32."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP81 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 28]Page 81sciousness, developing straight and natural, with no element of morbid compunction or crisis, is contained in theanswer of Dr. Edward Everett Hale, the eminent Unitarian preacher and writer, to one of Dr. Starbuck's circulars. Iquote a part of it:—''I observe, with profound regret, the religious struggles which come into many biographies, as if almost essential to the formation of thehero. I ought to speak of these, to say that any man has an advantage, not to be estimated, who is born, as I was, into a family where thereligion is simple and rational; who is trained in the theory of such a religion, so that he never knows, for an hour, what these religious orirreligious struggles are. I always knew God loved me, and I was always grateful to him for the world he placed me in. I always liked totell him so, and was always glad to receive his suggestions to me. I can remember perfectly that when I was coming to manhood, thehalf-philosophical novels of the time had a deal to say about the young men and maidens who were facing the 'problem of life.' I had noidea whatever what the problem of life was. To live with all my might seemed to me easy; to learn where there was so much to learnseemed pleasant and almost of course; to lend a hand, if one had a chance, natural; and if one did this, why, he enjoyed life because hecould not help it, and without proving to himself that he ought to enjoy it. A child who is early taught that he is God's child, that he maylive and move and have his being in God, and that he has, therefore, infinite strength at hand for the conquering of any difficulty, willtake life more easily, and probably will make more of it, than one who is told that he is born the child of wrath and wholly incapable ofgood.\"1One can but recognize in such writers as these the presence of a temperament organically weighted on the side ofcheer and fatally forbidden to linger, as those of opposite temperament linger, over the darker aspects of the universe.In some1STARBUCK: Psychology of Religion, pp. 305, 306."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP82 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 29]Page 82individuals optimism may become quasi-pathological. The capacity for even a transient sadness or a momentaryhumility seems cut off from them as by a kind of congenital anæsthesia.1The supreme contemporary example of such an inability to feel evil is of course Walt Whitman.\"His favorite occupation,\" writes his disciple, Dr. Bucke, \"seemed to be strolling or sauntering about outdoors by himself, looking at thegrass, the trees, the flowers, the vistas of light, the varying aspects of the sky, and listening to the birds, the crickets, the tree frogs, and allthe hundreds of natural sounds. It was evident that these things gave him a pleasure far beyond what they give to ordinary people. Until Iknew the man,\" continues Dr. Bucke, \"it had not occurred to me that any one could derive so much absolute happiness from these thingsas he did. He was very fond of flowers, either wild or cultivated; liked all sorts. I think he admired lilacs and sunflowers just as much asroses. Perhaps, indeed, no man who ever lived liked so many things and disliked so few as Walt Whitman. All natural objects seemed tohave a charm for him. All sights and sounds seemed to please him. He appeared to like (and I believe1\"I know not to what physical laws philosophers will some day refer the feelings of melancholy. For myself, I find that they are the mostvoluptuous of all sensations,\" writes Saint Pierre, and accordingly he devotes a series of sections of his work on Nature to the Plaisirs dela Ruine, Plaisirs des Tombeaux, Ruines de la Nature, Plaisirs de la Solitude—each of them more optimistic than the last.This finding of a luxury in woe is very common during adolescence. The truth-telling Marie Bashkirtseff expresses it well:—\"In this depression and dreadful uninterrupted suffering, I don't condemn life. On the contrary, I like it and find it good. Can you believe it? Ifind everything good and pleasant, even my tears, my grief. I enjoy weeping, I enjoy my despair. I enjoy being exasperated and sad. I feel asif these were so many diversions, and I love life in spite of them all. I want to live on. It would be cruel to have me die when I am soaccommodating. I cry, I grieve, and at the same time I am pleased—no, not exactly that—I know not how to express it. But everything in lifepleases me. I find everything agreeable, and in the very midst of my prayers for happiness, I find myself happy at being miserable. It is not Iwho undergo all this—my body weeps and cries; but something inside of me which is above me is glad of it all.\" Journal de MarieBashkirtseff, i. 67."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP83 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 30]Page 83he did like) all the men, women, and children he saw (though I never knew him to say that he liked any one), but each who knew himfelt that he liked him or her, and that he liked others also. I never knew him to argue or dispute, and he never spoke about money. Healways justified, sometimes playfully, sometimes quite seriously, those who spoke harshly of himself or his writings, and I often thoughthe even took pleasure in the opposition of enemies. When I first knew [him], I used to think that he watched himself, and would notallow his tongue to give expression to fretfulness, antipathy, complaint, and remonstrance. It did not occur to me as possible that thesemental states could be absent in him. After long observation, however, I satisfied myself that such absence or unconsciousness wasentirely real. He never spoke deprecatingly of any nationality or class of men, or time in the world's history, or against any trades oroccupations—not even against any animals, insects, or inanimate things, nor any of the laws of nature, nor any of the results of thoselaws, such as illness, deformity, and death. He never complained or grumbled either at the weather, pain, illness, or anything else. Henever swore. He could not very well, since he never spoke in anger and apparently never was angry. He never exhibited fear, and I do notbelieve he ever felt it.\"1Walt Whitman owes his importance in literature to the systematic expulsion from his writings of all contractileelements. The only sentiments he allowed himself to express were of the expansive order; and he expressed these inthe first person, not as your mere monstrously conceited individual might so express them, but vicariously for all men,so that a passionate and mystic ontological emotion suffuses his words, and ends by persuading the reader that menand women, life and death, and all things are divinely good.Thus it has come about that many persons to-day regard Walt Whitman as the restorer of the eternal natural religion.He has infected them with his own love of comrades, with his own gladness that he and they exist. Societies areactually1R. M.

The word nowadays means sometimes the mere natural animal man without asense of sin; sometimes it means a Greek or Roman with his own peculiar religious consciousness. In neither of thesesenses does it fitly define this poet. He is more than your mere animal man who has not tasted of the tree of good andevil. He is aware enough of sin for a swagger to be present in his indifference towards it, a conscious pride in hisfreedom from flexions and contractions, which your genuine pagan in the first sense of the word would never show.\"I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contained,I stand and look at them long and long;They do not sweat and whine about their condition.They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins.Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\"2No natural pagan could have written these well-known lines. But on the other hand Whitman is less than a Greek orRoman; for their consciousness, even in Homeric times, was full to the brim of the sad mortality of this sunlit world,and such a consciousness Walt Whitman resolutely refuses to adopt. When, for example, Achilles, about to slayLycaon, Priam's young son, hears him sue for mercy, he stops to say:—\"Ah, friend, thou too must die: why thus lamentest1I refer to The Conservator, edited by Horace Traubel, and published monthly at Philadelphia.2Song of Myself, 32."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP85 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 33]Page 85thou? Patroclos too is dead, who was better far than thou. Over me too hang death and forceful fate. There cometh morn or eve or somenoonday when my life too some man shall take in battle, whether with spear he smite, or arrow from the string.\"1Then Achilles savagely severs the poor boy's neck with his sword, heaves him by the foot into the Scamander, andcalls to the fishes of the river to eat the white fat of Lycaon. Just as here the cruelty and the sympathy each ring true,and do not mix or interfere with one another, so did the Greeks and Romans keep all their sadnesses and gladnessesunmingled and entire. Instinctive good they did not reckon sin; nor had they any such desire to save the credit of theuniverse as to make them insist, as so many of us insist, that what immediately appears as evil must be 'good in themaking,' or something equally ingenious. Good was good, and bad just bad, for the earlier Greeks. They neitherdenied the ills of nature,—Walt Whitman's verse, 'What is called good is perfect and what is called bad is just asperfect,' would have been mere silliness to them,—nor did they, in order to escape from those ills, invent 'another anda better world' of the imagination, in which, along with the ills, the innocent goods of sense would also find no place.This integrity of the instinctive reactions, this freedom from all moral sophistry and strain, gives a pathetic dignity toancient pagan feeling. And this quality Whitman's outpourings have not got. His optimism is too voluntary anddefiant; his gospel has a touch of bravado and an affected twist,2 and this diminishes its effect on many readers whoyet are well disposed towards optimism, and on the whole quite willing to admit that in important respects Whitman isof the genuine lineage of the prophets.If, then, we give the name of healthy-mindedness to the tendency which looks on all things and sees that they are1Iliad, XXI., E. Myers's translation.2\"God is afraid of me!\" remarked such a titanic-optimistic friend in my presence one morning when he was feeling particularly hearty andcannibalistic. The defiance of the phrase showed that a Christian education in humility still rankled in his breast."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP86 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 34]Page 86good, we find that we must distinguish between a more involuntary and a more voluntary or systematic way of beinghealthy-minded. In its involuntary variety, healthy-mindedness is a way of feeling happy about things immediately. Inits systematical variety, it is an abstract way of conceiving things as good. Every abstract way of conceiving thingsselects some one aspect of them as their essence for the time being, and disregards the other aspects. Systematichealthy-mindedness, conceiving good as the essential and universal aspect of being, deliberately excludes evil from itsfield of vision; and although, when thus nakedly stated, this might seem a difficult feat to perform for one who isintellectually sincere with himself and honest about facts, a little reflection shows that the situation is too complex tolie open to so simple a criticism.In the first place, happiness, like every other emotional state, has blindness and insensibility to opposing facts given itas its instinctive weapon for self-protection against disturbance. When happiness is actually in possession, the thoughtof evil can no more acquire the feeling of reality than the thought of good can gain reality when melancholy rules. Tothe man actively happy, from whatever cause, evil simply cannot then and there be believed in. He must ignore it; andto the bystander he may then seem perversely to shut his eyes to it and hush it up.But more than this: the hushing of it up may, in a perfectly candid and honest mind, grow into a deliberate religiouspolicy, or parti pris. Much of what we call evil is due entirely to the way men take the phenomenon. It can so often beconverted into a bracing and tonic good by a simple change of the sufferer's inner attitude from one of fear to one offight; its sting so often departs and turns into a relish when, after vainly seeking to shun it, we agree to face about andbear it cheerfully, that a man is simply bound in honor, with reference to many of the facts that seem at first todisconcert his peace, to adopt this way of escape. Refuse to admit their badness; despise their power; ignore theirpresence; turn your attention the other way; and so far as you yourself are concerned at any rate, though the facts maystill exist, their evil character exists no longer. Since you make them evil or good"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP87 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 35]Page 87by your own thoughts about them, it is the ruling of your thoughts which proves to be your principal concern.The deliberate adoption of an optimistic turn of mind thus makes its entrance into philosophy. And once in, it is hardto trace its lawful bounds. Not only does the human instinct for happiness, bent on self-protection by ignoring, keepworking in its favor, but higher inner ideals have weighty words to say. The attitude of unhappiness is not onlypainful, it is mean and ugly. What can be more base and unworthy than the pining, puling, mumping mood, no matterby what outward ills it may have been engendered? What is more injurious to others? What less helpful as a way outof the difficulty? It but fastens and perpetuates the trouble which occasioned it, and increases the total evil of thesituation. At all costs, then, we ought to reduce the sway of that mood; we ought to scout it in ourselves and others,and never show it tolerance. But it is impossible to carry on this discipline in the subjective sphere without zealouslyemphasizing the brighter and minimizing the darker aspects of the objective sphere of things at the same time. Andthus our resolution not to indulge in misery, beginning at a comparatively small point within ourselves, may not stopuntil it has brought the entire frame of reality under a systematic conception optimistic enough to be congenial withits needs.In all this I say nothing of any mystical insight or persuasion that the total frame of things absolutely must be good.Such mystical persuasion plays an enormous part in the history of the religious consciousness, and we must look at itlater with some care. But we need not go so far at present. More ordinary non-mystical conditions of rapture sufficefor my immediate contention. All invasive moral states and passionate enthusiasms make one feelingless to evil insome direction. The common penalties cease to deter the patriot, the usual prudences are flung by the lover to thewinds. When the passion is extreme, suffering may actually be gloried in, provided it be for the ideal cause, death maylose its sting, the grave its victory. In these states, the ordinary contrast of good and ill seems to be swallowed up in ahigher denomination, an omnipotent excitement which engulfs the evil, and which the human being welcomes as thecrowning experience"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP88 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 36]Page 88of his life. This, he says, is truly to live, and I exult in the heroic opportunity and adventure.The systematic cultivation of healthy-mindedness as a religious attitude is therefore consonant with important currentsin human nature, and is anything but absurd. In fact, we all do cultivate it more or less, even when our professedtheology should in consistency forbid it. We divert our attention from disease and death as much as we can; and theslaughter-houses and indecencies without end on which our life is founded are huddled out of sight and nevermentioned, so that the world we recognize officially in literature and in society is a poetic fiction far handsomer andcleaner and better than the world that really is.1The advance of liberalism, so-called, in Christianity, during the past fifty years, may fairly be called a victory ofhealthy-mindedness within the church over the morbidness with which the old hell-fire theology was moreharmoniously related. We have now whole congregations whose preachers, far from magnifying our consciousness ofsin, seem devoted rather to making little of it. They ignore, or even deny, eternal punishment, and insist on the dignityrather than on the depravity of man. They look at the continual preoccupation of the old-fashioned Christian with thesalvation of his soul as something sickly and reprehensible rather than admirable; and a sanguine and 'muscular'attitude, which to our fore-fathers would have seemed purely heathen, has become in their eyes an ideal element ofChristian character. I am not asking whether or not they are right, I am only pointing out the change.The persons to whom I refer have still retained for the most part their nominal connection with Christianity, in spite oftheir discarding of its more pessimistic theological elements. But in that 'theory of evolution' which, gatheringmomentum for a century, has within the past twenty-five years swept so1\"As I go on in this life, day by day, I become more of a bewildered child; I cannot get used to this world, to procreation, to heredity, tosight, to hearing; the commonest things are a burthen.

The idea of a universal evolution lends itselfto a doctrine of general meliorism and progress which fits the religious needs of the healthy-minded so well that itseems almost as if it might have been created for their use. Accordingly we find 'evolutionism' interpreted thusoptimistically and embraced as a substitute for the religion they were born in, by a multitude of our contemporarieswho have either been trained scientifically, or been fond of reading popular science, and who had already begun to beinwardly dissatisfied with what seemed to them the harshness and irrationality of the orthodox Christian scheme. Asexamples are better than descriptions, I will quote a document received in answer to Professor Starbuck's circular ofquestions. The writer's state of mind may by courtesy be called a religion, for it is his reaction on the whole nature ofthings, it is systematic and reflective, and it loyally binds him to certain inner ideals. I think you will recognize in him,coarse-meated and incapable of wounded spirit as he is, a sufficiently familiar contemporary type.Q. What does Religion mean to you?A. It means nothing; and it seems, so far as I can observe, useless to others. I am sixty-seven years of age and haveresided in X. fifty years, and have been in business forty-five, consequently I have some little experience of life andmen, and some women too, and I find that the most religious and pious people are as a rule those most lacking inuprightness and morality. The men who do not go to church or have any religious convictions are the best. Praying,singing of hymns, and sermonizing are pernicious—they teach us to rely on some supernatural power, when we oughtto rely on ourselves. I teetotally disbelieve in a God. The God-idea was begotten in ignorance, fear, and a general lackof any knowledge of Nature.

What comes before your mind corresponding to the words God, Heaven, Angels, etc.?A. Nothing whatever. I am a man without a religion. These words mean so much mythic bosh.Q. Have you had any experiences which appeared providential?A. None whatever. There is no agency of the superintending kind.

His contentment with thefinite incases him like a lobster-shell and shields him from all morbid repining at his distance from the Infinite. Wehave in him an excellent example of the optimism which may be encouraged by popular science.To my mind a current far more important and interesting religiously than that which sets in from natural sciencetowards healthy-mindedness is that which has recently poured over America and seems to be gathering force everyday,—I am ignorant what foothold it may yet have acquired in Great Britain,—and to which, for the sake of having abrief designation, I will give the title of the 'Mind-cure movement.' There are various sects of this 'New Thought,' touse another of the names by which it calls itself; but their agreements are so profound that their differences may beneglected for my present purpose, and I will treat the movement, without apology, as if it were a simple thing.It is a deliberately optimistic scheme of life, with both a speculative and a practical side. In its gradual developmentduring the last quarter of a century, it has taken up into itself a number of contributory elements, and it must now bereckoned with as a genuine religious power. It has reached the stage, for example, when the demand for its literature isgreat enough for insincere stuff, mechanically produced for the market, to be to a certain extent supplied bypublishers, —a phenomenon never observed, I imagine, until a religion has got well past its earliest insecurebeginnings.One of the doctrinal sources of Mind-cure is the four Gospels; another is Emersonianism or New Englandtranscendentalism; another is Berkeleyan idealism; another is spiritism, with its messages of 'law' and 'progress' and'development'; another the optimistic popular science evolutionism of which I have recently spoken; and, finally,Hinduism has contributed a strain. But the most characteristic feature of the mindcure movement is an inspirationmuch more direct. The leaders in this faith have had an intuitive belief in the all-saving power of healthy-mindedattitudes as such, in the conquering efficacy of courage, hope, and trust, and a correlative contempt for doubt, fear,worry, and all nervously precautionary"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP92 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 41]Page 92states of mind.1 Their belief has in a general way been corroborated by the practical experience of their disciples; andthis experience forms to-day a mass imposing in amount.The blind have been made to see, the halt to walk; lifelong invalids have had their health restored. The moral fruitshave been no less remarkable. The deliberate adoption of a healthy-minded attitude has proved possible to many whonever supposed they had it in them; regeneration of character has gone on on an extensive scale; and cheerfulness hasbeen restored to countless homes. The indirect influence of this has been great. The mind-cure principles arebeginning so to pervade the air that one catches their spirit at second-hand. One hears of the 'Gospel of Relaxation,' ofthe 'Don't Worry Movement,' of people who repeat to themselves, 'Youth, health, vigor!' when dressing in themorning, as their motto for the day. Complaints of the weather are getting to be forbidden in many households; andmore and more people are recognizing it to be bad form to speak of disagreeable sensations, or to make much of theordinary inconveniences and ailments of life. These general tonic effects on public opinion would be good even if themore striking results were non-existent. But the latter abound so that we can afford to over-look the innumerablefailures and self-deceptions that are mixed in with them (for in everything human failure is a matter of course), andwe can also overlook the verbiage of a good deal of the mind-cure literature, some of which is so moonstruck withoptimism and so vaguely expressed that an academically trained intellect finds it almost impossible to read it at all.The plain fact remains that the spread of the movement has been due to practical fruits, and the extremely practicalturn of character of the American people has never been better1'Cautionary Verses for Children': this title of a much used work, published early in the nineteenth century, shows how far the muse ofevangelical protestantism in England, with her mind fixed on the idea of danger, had at last drifted away from the original gospelfreedom. Mind-cure might be briefly called a reaction against all that religion of chronic anxiety which marked the earlier part of ourcentury in the evangelical circles of England and America."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP93 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 43]Page 93shown than by the fact that this, their only decidedly original contribution to the systematic philosophy of life, shouldbe so intimately knit up with concrete therapeutics. To the importance of mind-cure the medical and clericalprofessions in the United States are beginning, though with much recalcitrancy and protesting, to open their eyes. It isevidently bound to develop still farther, both speculatively and practically, and its latest writers are far and away theablest of the group.1 It matters nothing that, just as there are hosts of persons who cannot pray, so there are greaterhosts who cannot by any possibility be influenced by the mind-curers' ideas. For our immediate purpose, the importantpoint is that so large a number should exist who can be so influenced. They form a psychic type to be studied withrespect.2To come now to a little closer quarters with their creed. The fundamental pillar on which it rests is nothing more thanthe general basis of all religious experience, the fact that man has a dual nature, and is connected with two spheres ofthought, a shallower and a profounder sphere, in either of which he may learn to live more habitually. The shallowerand lower sphere is that of the fleshly sensations, instincts,1I refer to Mr. Horatio W. Dresser and Mr. Henry Wood, especially the former. Mr. Dresser's works are published by G. P. Putnam'sSons, New York and London; Mr. Wood's by Lee & Shepard, Boston.2Lest my own testimony be suspected, I will quote another reporter, Dr. H. H. Goddard, of Clark University, whose thesis on ''the Effects ofMind on Body as evidenced by Faith Cures\" is published in the American Journal of Psychology for 1899 (vol. x.). This critic, after a widestudy of the facts, concludes that the cures by mind-cure exist, but are in no respect different from those now officially recognized inmedicine as cures by suggestion; and the end of his essay contains an interesting physiological speculation as to the way in which thesuggestive ideas may work (p. 67 of the reprint). As regards the general phenomenon of mental cure itself, Dr. Goddard writes: \"In spite ofthe severe criticism we have made of reports of cure, there still remains a vast amount of material, showing a powerful influence of the mindin disease. Many cases are of diseases that have been diagnosed and treated by the best physicians of the country, or which prominenthospitals have tried their hand at curing, but without success. People of culture and education have been treated by this method withsatisfactory results. Diseases of long standing have been ameliorated, and even cured. We have traced the mental element through primitivemedicine and folk-medicine of to-day, patent medicine, and witchcraft. We are convinced that it is impossible to(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP94 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 44]Page 94and desires, of egotism, doubt, and the lower personal interests. But whereas Christian theology has alwaysconsidered frowardness to be the essential vice of this part of human nature, the mind-curers say that the mark of thebeast in it is fear; and this is what gives such an entirely new religious turn to their persuasion.\"Fear,\" to quote a writer of the school, \"has had its uses in the evolutionary process, and seems to constitute the whole of forethought inmost animals; but that it should remain any part of the mental equipment of human civilized life is an absurdity. I find that the fearelement of forethought is not stimulating to those more civilized persons to whom duty and attraction are the natural motives, but isweakening and deterrent. As soon as it becomes unnecessary, fear becomes a positive deterrent, and should be entirely removed, as deadflesh is removed from living tissue. To assist in the analysis of fear, and in the denunciation of its expressions, I have coined the wordforethought to stand for the unprofitable element of forethought, and have defined the word 'worry' as fearthought in contradistinction toforethought. I have also defined fearthought as the self-imposed or self-permitted suggestion of inferiority, in order to(Footnote continued from previous page)account for the existence of these practices, if they did not cure disease, and that if they cured disease, it must have been the mentalelement that was effective. The same argument applies to those modern schools of mental therapeutics—Divine Healing and ChristianScience. It is hardly conceivable that the large body of intelligent people who comprise the body known distinctively as Mental Scientistsshould continue to exist if the whole thing were a delusion. It is not a thing of a day; it is not confined to a few; it is not local. It is truethat many failures are recorded, but that only adds to the argument. There must be many and striking successes to counterbalance thefailures, otherwise the failures would have ended the delusion. Christian Science, Divine Healing, or Mental Science do not, and nevercan in the very nature of things, cure all diseases; nevertheless, the practical applications of the general principles of the broadest mentalscience will tend to prevent disease. We do find sufficient evidence to convince us that the proper reform in mental attitude wouldrelieve many a sufferer of ills that the ordinary physician cannot touch; would even delay the approach of death to many a victim beyondthe power of absolute cure, and the faithful adherence to a truer philosophy of life will keep many a man well, and give the doctor timeto devote to alleviating ills that are unpreventable\" (pp. 33, 34 of reprint)."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP95 hl[27 02 2011 00 30 45]Page 95place it where it really belongs, in the category of harmful, unnecessary, and therefore not respectable things.'1The 'misery-habit,' the 'martyr-habit,' engendered by the prevalent 'fearthought,' get pungent criticism from the mind-cure writers:—\"Consider for a moment the habits of life into which we are born. There are certain social conventions or customs and allegedrequirements, there is a theological bias, a general view of the world. There are conservative ideas in regard to our early training, oureducation, marriage, and occupation in life. Following close upon this, there is a long series of anticipations, namely, that we shall suffercertain children's diseases, diseases of middle life, and of old age; the thought that we shall grow old, lose our faculties, and againbecome childlike; while crowning all is the fear of death. Then there is a long line of particular fears and trouble-bearing expectations,such, for example, as ideas associated with certain articles of food, the dread of the east wind, the terrors of hot weather, the aches andpains associated with cold weather, the fear of catching cold if one sits in a draught, the coming of hay-fever upon the 14th of August inthe middle of the day, and so on through a long list of fears, dreads, worriments, anxieties, anticipations, expectations, pessimisms,morbidities, and the whole ghostly train of fateful shapes which our fellow-men, and especially physicians, are ready to help us conjureup, an array worthy to rank with Bradley's 'unearthly ballet of bloodless categories.'\"Yet this is not all. This vast array is swelled by innumerable volunteers from daily life,—the fear of accident, the possibility of calamity,the loss of property, the chance of robbery, of fire, or the outbreak of war. And it is not deemed sufficient to fear for ourselves. When afriend is taken ill, we must forthwith fear the worst and apprehend1HORACE FLETCHER: Happiness as found in Forethought minus Fearthought, Menticulture Series, ii.

If one meets with sorrow sympathy means to enter into and increase the suffering.\"1\"Man,\" to quote another writer, \"often has fear stamped upon him before his entrance into the outer world; he is reared in fear; all his lifeis passed in bondage to fear of disease and death, and thus his whole mentality becomes cramped, limited, and depressed, and his bodyfollows its shrunken pattern and specification. Think of the millions of sensitive and responsive souls among our ancestors who havebeen under the dominion of such a perpetual nightmare! Is it not surprising that health exists at all? Nothing but the boundless divinelove, exuberance, and vitality, constantly poured in, even though unconsciously to us, could in some degree neutralize such an ocean ofmorbidity.\"2Although the disciples of the mind-cure often use Christian terminology, one sees from such quotations how widelytheir notion of the fall of man diverges from that of ordinary Christians.3Their notion of man's higher nature is hardly less diver-1H. W. DRESSER: Voices of Freedom, New York, 1899, p. 38.2HENRY WOOD: Ideal Suggestion through Mental Photography, Boston, 1899, p. 54.3Whether it differs so much from Christ's own notion is for the exegetists to decide. According to Harnack, Jesus felt about evil and diseasemuch as our mind-curers do. \"What is the answer which Jesus sends to John the Baptist?\" asks Harnack, and says it is this: \"'The blind see,and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead rise up, and the gospel is preached to the poor.' That is the 'coming ofthe kingdom,' or rather in these saving works the kingdom is already there. By the overcoming and removal of misery, of need, of sickness,by these actual effects John is to see that the new time has arrived. The casting out of devils is only a part of this work of redemption, butJesus points to that as the sense and seal of his mission. Thus to the wretched, sick, and poor did he address himself, but not as a moralist,and without a trace of sentimentalism. He never makes groups and departments of the ills; he never spends time in asking whether the sickone 'deserves' to be cured; and it never occurs to him to sympathize with the pain or the death. He nowhere says that sickness is a beneficentinfliction, and that evil has a healthy use. No, he calls sickness sickness and health health. All evil, all wretchedness, is for him somethingdreadful; it is of the great kingdom of Satan; but he feels the power of the Saviour within him. He knows that advance is possible only whenweakness is overcome, when sickness is made well.\" Das Wesen des Christenthums, 1900, p. 39."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP97 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 04]Page 97gent, being decidedly pantheistic. The spiritual in man appears in the mind-cure philosophy as partly conscious, butchiefly subconscious; and through the subconscious part of it we are already one with the Divine without any miracleof grace, or abrupt creation of a new inner man. As this view is variously expressed by different writers, we find in ittraces of Christian mysticism, of transcendental idealism, of vedantism, and of the modern psychology of thesubliminal self. A quotation or two will put us at the central point of view:—\"The great central fact of the universe is that spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all, that manifests itself in and through all.This spirit of infinite life and power that is back of all is what I call God. I care not what term you may use, be it Kindly Light,Providence, the Over-Soul, Omnipotence, or whatever term may be most convenient, so long as we are agreed in regard to the greatcentral fact itself. God then fills the universe alone, so that all is from Him and in Him, and there is nothing that is outside. He is the lifeof our life, our very life itself. We are partakers of the life of God; and though we differ from Him in that we are individualized spirits,while He is the Infinite Spirit, including us, as well as all else beside, yet in essence the life of God and the life of man are identically thesame, and so are one. They differ not in essence or quality; they differ in degree.\"The great central fact in human life is the coming into a conscious vital realization of our oneness with this Infinite Life, and theopening of ourselves fully to this divine inflow. In just the degree that we come into a conscious realization of our oneness with theInfinite Life, and open ourselves to this divine inflow, do we actualize in ourselves the qualities and powers of the Infinite Life, do wemake ourselves channels through which the Infinite Intelligence and Power can work. In just the degree in which you realize youroneness with the Infinite Spirit, you will exchange dis-ease for ease, inharmony for harmony, suffering and pain for abounding healthand strength. To recognize our own divinity, and our intimate relation to the Universal, is to attach the belts of our machinery to thepowerhouse of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP98 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 05]Page 98the Universe. One need remain in hell no longer than one chooses to; we can rise to any heaven we ourselves choose; and when wechoose so to rise, all the higher powers of the Universe combine to help us heavenward.\"1Let me now pass from these abstracter statements to some more concrete accounts of experience with the mind-curereligion. I have many answers from correspondents—the only difficulty is to choose. The first two whom I shall quoteare my personal friends. One of them, a woman, writing as follows, expresses well the feeling of continuity with theInfinite Power, by which all mind-cure disciples are inspired.\"The first underlying cause of all sickness, weakness, or depression is the human sense of separateness from that Divine Energy whichwe call God. The soul which can feel and affirm in serene but jubilant confidence, as did the Nazarene: 'I and my Father are one,' has nofurther need of healer, or of healing. This is the whole truth in a nutshell, and other foundation for wholeness can no man lay than thisfact of impregnable divine union. Disease can no longer attack one whose feet are planted on this rock, who feels hourly, momently, theinflux of the Deific Breath. If one with Omnipotence, how can weariness enter the consciousness, how illness assail that indomitablespark?\"This possibility of annulling forever the law of fatigue has been abundantly proven in my own case; for my earlier life bears a record ofmany, many years of bedridden invalidism, with spine and lower limbs paralyzed. My thoughts were no more impure than they are to-day, although my belief in the necessity of illness was dense and unenlightened; but since my resurrection in the flesh, I have worked asa healer unceasingly for fourteen years without a vacation, and can truthfully assert that I have never known a moment of fatigue or pain,although coming in touch constantly with excessive weakness, illness, and disease of all kinds. For how can a conscious part of Deity besick?—since 'Greater is he that is with us than all that can strive against us.'\"1R. W. TRINE: In Tune with the Infinite, 26th thousand, N. Y., 1899.

I was always breaking down, and had several attacks of what is called nervous prostration, withterrible insomnia, being on the verge of insanity; besides having many other troubles, especially of the digestive organs. I had been sentaway from home in charge of doctors, had taken all the narcotics, stopped all work, been fed up, and in fact knew all the doctors withinreach. But I never recovered permanently till this New Thought took possession of me.\"I think that the one thing which impressed me most was learning the fact that we must be in absolutely constant relation or mental touch(this word is to me very expressive) with that essence of life which permeates all and which we call God. This is almost unrecognizableunless we live it into ourselves actually, that is, by a constant turning to the very innermost, deepest consciousness of our real selves orof God in us, for illumination from within, just as we turn to the sun for light, warmth, and invigoration without. When you do thisconsciously, realizing that to turn inward to the light within you is to live in the presence of God or your divine self, you soon discoverthe unreality of the objects to which you have hitherto been turning and which have engrossed you without.\"I have come to disregard the meaning of this attitude for bodily health as such, because that comes of itself, as an incidental result, andcannot be found by any special mental act or desire to have it, beyond that general attitude of mind I have referred to above. That whichwe usually make the object of life, those outer things we are all so wildly seeking, which we so often live and die for, but which then donot give us peace and happiness, they should all come of themselves as accessory, and as the mere outcome or natural result of a farhigher life sunk deep in the bosom of the spirit.

Such things should be results, not objects. I would also include pleasures of many kinds which seemharmless and good at the time, and are pursued because many accept them—I mean conventionalities, sociabilities, and fashions in theirvarious development, these being mostly approved by the masses, although they may be unreal, and even unhealthy superfluities.\"Here is another case, more concrete, also that of a woman. I read you these cases without comment,—they express somany varieties of the state of mind we are studying.\"I had been a sufferer from my childhood till my fortieth year. [Details of ill-health are given which I omit.] I had been in Vermontseveral months hoping for good from the change of air, but steadily growing weaker, when one day during the latter part of October,while resting in the afternoon, I suddenly heard as it were these words: 'You will be healed and do a work you never dreamed of.' Thesewords were impressed upon my mind with such power I said at once that only God could have put them there. I believed them in spite ofmyself and of my suffering and weakness, which continued until Christmas, when I returned to Boston. Within two days a young friendoffered to take me to a mental healer (this was January 7, 1881). The healer said: 'There is nothing but Mind; we are expressions of theOne Mind; body is only a mortal belief; as a man thinketh so is he.' I could not accept all she said, but I translated all that was there forme in this way: 'There is nothing but God; I am created by Him, and am absolutely dependent upon Him; mind is given me to use; and byjust so much of it as I will put upon the thought of right action in body I shall be lifted out of bondage to my ignorance and fear and pastexperience.' That day I commenced accordingly to take"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP101 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 09]Page 101a little of every food provided for the family, constantly saying to myself: 'The Power that created the stomach must take care of what Ihave eaten.' By holding these suggestions through the evening I went to bed and fell asleep, saying: 'I am soul, spirit, just one with God'sThought of me,' and slept all night without waking, for the first time in several years [the distress-turns had usually recurred about twoo'clock in the night]. I felt the next day like an escaped prisoner, and believed I had found the secret that would in time give me perfecthealth. Within ten days I was able to eat anything provided for others, and after two weeks I began to have my own positive mentalsuggestions of Truth, which were to me like stepping-stones. I will note a few of them; they came about two weeks apart.\"Ist. I am Soul, therefore it is well with me.\"2d. I am Soul, therefore I am well.\"3d. A sort of inner vision of myself as a four-footed beast with a protuberance on every part of my body where I had suffering, with myown face, begging me to acknowledge it as myself.

Again refusal to acknowledge.\"5th. Once more the vision, but only of my eyes with the longing look; and again the refusal. Then came the conviction, the innerconsciousness, that I was perfectly well and always had been, for I was Soul, an expression of God's Perfect Thought. That was to me theperfect and completed separation between what I was and what I appeared to be. I succeeded in never losing sight after this of my realbeing, by constantly affirming this truth, and by degrees (though it took me two years of hard work to get there) I expressed healthcontinuously throughout my whole body.\"In my subsequent nineteen years' experience I have never known this Truth to fail when I applied it, though in my ignorance I haveoften failed to apply it, but through my failures I have learned the simplicity and trustfulness of the little child.\"But I fear that I risk tiring you by so many examples, and"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP102 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 11]Page 102I must lead you back to philosophic generalities again. You see already by such records of experience how impossibleit is not to class mind-cure as primarily a religious movement. Its doctrine of the oneness of our life with God's life isin fact quite indistinguishable from an interpretation of Christ's message which in these very Gifford lectures has beendefended by some of your very ablest Scottish religious philosophers.1But philosophers usually profess to give a quasi-logical explanation of the existence of evil, whereas of the generalfact of evil in the world, the existence of the selfish, suffering, timorous finite consciousness, the mind-curers, so faras I am acquainted with them, profess to give no speculative explanation. Evil is empirically there for them as it is foreverybody, but the practical point of view predominates, and it would ill agree with the spirit of their system to spendtime in worrying over it as a 'mystery' or 'problem,' or in 'laying to heart' the lesson of its experience, after the mannerof the Evangelicals. Don't reason about it, as Dante says, but give a1The Cairds, for example. In EDWARD CAIRD's Glasgow Lectures of 1890—92 passages like this abound:—\"The declaration made in the beginning of the ministry of Jesus that 'the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand,' passes withscarce a break into the announcement that 'the kingdom of God is among you'; and the importance of this announcement is asserted to be suchthat it makes, so to speak, a difference in kind between the greatest saints and prophets who lived under the previous reign of division, and'the least in the kingdom of heaven.' The highest ideal is brought close to men and declared to be within their reach, they are called on to be'perfect as their Father in heaven is perfect.' The sense of alienation and distance from God which had grown upon the pious in Israel just inproportion as they had learned to look upon Him as no mere national divinity, but as a God of justice who would punish Israel for its sin ascertainly as Edom or Moab, is declared to be no longer in place; and the typical form of Christian prayer points to the abolition of thecontrast between this world and the next which through all the history of the Jews had continually been growing wider: 'As in heaven, so onearth.' The sense of the division of man from God, as a finite being from the Infinite, as weak and sinful from the Omnipotent Goodness, isnot indeed lost; but it can no longer overpower the consciousness of oneness. The terms 'Son' and 'Father' at once state the opposition andmark its limit. They show that it is not an absolute opposition, but one which presupposes an indestructible principle of unity, that can andmust become a principle of reconciliation.\" The Evolution of Religion, ii. pp. 146, 147."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP103 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 12]Page 103glance and pass beyond! It is Avidhya, ignorance! something merely to be outgrown and left behind, transcended andforgotten. Christian Science so-called, the sect of Mrs. Eddy, is the most radical branch of mind-cure in its dealingswith evil. For it evil is simply a lie, and any one who mentions it is a liar. The optimistic ideal of duty forbids us topay it the compliment even of explicit attention. Of course, as our next lectures will show us, this is a bad speculativeomission, but it is intimately linked with the practical merits of the system we are examining. Why regret a philosophyof evil, a mindcurer would ask us, if I can put you in possession of a life of good?After all, it is the life that tells; and mind-cure has developed a living system of mental hygiene which may well claimto have thrown all previous literature of the Diatetik der Seele into the shade. This system is wholly and exclusivelycompacted of optimism: 'Pessimism leads to weakness. Optimism leads to power.' 'Thoughts are things,' as one of themost vigorous mind-cure writers prints in bold type at the bottom of each of his pages; and if your thoughts are ofhealth, youth, vigor, and success, before you know it these things will also be your outward portion. No one can failof the regenerative influence of optimistic thinking, pertinaciously pursued. Every man owns indefeasibly this inlet tothe divine. Fear, on the contrary, and all the contracted and egoistic modes of thought, are inlets to destruction. Mostmind-curers here bring in a doctrine that thoughts are 'forces,' and that, by virtue of a law that like attracts like, oneman's thoughts draw to themselves as allies all the thoughts of the same character that exist the world over. Thus onegets, by one's thinking, reinforcements from elsewhere for the realization of one's desires; and the great point in theconduct of life is to get the heavenly forces on one's side by opening one's own mind to their influx.On the whole, one is struck by a psychological similarity between the mind-cure movement and the Lutheran andWesleyan movements. To the believer in moralism and works, with his anxious query, 'What shall I do to be saved?'Luther and Wesley replied: 'You are saved now, if you would but believe it.' And the mind-curers come with preciselysimilar"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP104 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 13]Page 104words of emancipation. They speak, it is true, to persons for whom the conception of salvation has lost its ancienttheological meaning, but who labor nevertheless with the same eternal human difficulty. Things are wrong with them;and 'What shall I do to be clear, right, sound, whole, well?' is the form of their question. And the answer is: 'You arewell, sound, and clear already, if you did but know it.' ''The whole matter may be summed up in one sentence,\" saysone of the authors whom I have already quoted, \"God is well, and so are you. You must awaken to the knowledge ofyour real being.\"The adequacy of their message to the mental needs of a large fraction of mankind is what gave force to those earliergospels. Exactly the same adequacy holds in the case of the mind-cure message, foolish as it may sound upon itssurface; and seeing its rapid growth in influence, and its therapeutic triumphs, one is tempted to ask whether it maynot be destined (probably by very reason of the crudity and extravagance of many of its manifestations1) to play apart almost as great in the evolution of the popular religion of the future as did those earlier movements in their day.But I here fear that I may begin to 'jar upon the nerves' of some of the members of this academic audience. Suchcontemporary vagaries, you may think, should hardly take so large a place in dignified Gifford lectures. I can onlybeseech you to have patience. The whole outcome of these lectures will, I imagine, be the emphasizing to your mindof the enormous diversities which the spiritual lives of different men exhibit. Their wants, their susceptibilities, andtheir capacities all vary and must be classed under different heads. The result is that we have really different types ofreligious experience; and, seeking in these lectures closer acquaintance with the healthy-minded type, we must take itwhere we find it in most radical form. The psychology of individual types of character has hardly begun even to besketched as yet—our lectures may possibly serve as a crumb-like contribution to the struc-1It remains to be seen whether the school of Mr. Dresser, which assumes more and more the form of mind-cure experience and academicphilosophy mutually impregnating each other, will score the practical triumphs of the less critical and rational sects."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP105 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 14]Page 105ture. The first thing to bear in mind (especially if we ourselves belong to the cleric-academic-scientific type, theofficially and conventionally 'correct' type, 'the deadly respectable' type, for which to ignore others is a besettingtemptation) is that nothing can be more stupid than to bar out phenomena from our notice, merely because we areincapable of taking any part in them ourselves.Now the history of Lutheran salvation by faith, of methodistic conversions, and of what I call the mind-curemovement seems to prove the existence of numerous persons in whom—at any rate at a certain stage in theirdevelopment—a change of character for the better, so far from being facilitated by the rules laid down by officialmoralists, will take place all the more successfully if those rules be exactly reversed. Official moralists advise us neverto relax our strenuousness. \"Be vigilant, day and night,\" they adjure us; \"hold your passive tendencies in check; shrinkfrom no effort; keep your will like a bow always bent.\" But the persons I speak of find that all this conscious effortleads to nothing but failure and vexation in their hands, and only makes them twofold more the children of hell theywere before. The tense and voluntary attitude becomes in them an impossible fever and torment. Their machineryrefuses to run at all when the bearings are made so hot and the belts so tight.Under these circumstances the way to success, as vouched for by innumerable authentic personal narrations, is by ananti-moralistic method, by the 'surrender' of which I spoke in my second lecture. Passivity, not activity; relaxation, notintentness, should be now the rule. Give up the feeling of responsibility, let go your hold, resign the care of yourdestiny to higher powers, be genuinely indifferent as to what becomes of it all, and you will find not only that yougain a perfect inward relief, but often also, in addition, the particular goods you sincerely thought you wererenouncing. This is the salvation through self-despair, the dying to be truly born, of Lutheran theology, the passageinto nothing of which Jacob Behmen writes. To get to it, a critical point must usually be passed, a corner turnedwithin one. Something must give way, a native hardness must break down and liquefy; and this event (as we shallabundantly see hereafter) is frequently"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP106 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 16]Page 106sudden and automatic, and leaves on the Subject an impression that he has been wrought on by an external power.Whatever its ultimate significance may prove to be, this is certainly one fundamental form of human experience.Some say that the capacity or incapacity for it is what divides the religious from the merely moralistic character. Withthose who undergo it in its fullness, no criticism avails to cast doubt on its reality. They know; for they have actuallyfelt the higher powers, in giving up the tension of their personal will.A story which revivalist preachers often tell is that of a man who found himself at night slipping down the side of aprecipice. At last he caught a branch which stopped his fall, and remained clinging to it in misery for hours. Butfinally his fingers had to loose their hold, and with a despairing farewell to life, he let himself drop. He fell just sixinches. If he had given up the struggle earlier, his agony would have been spared. As the mother earth received him,so, the preachers tell us, will the everlasting arms receive us if we confide absolutely in them, and give up thehereditary habit of relying on our personal strength, with its precautions that cannot shelter and safeguards that neversave.The mind-curers have given the widest scope to this sort of experience. They have demonstrated that a form ofregeneration by relaxing, by letting go, psychologically indistinguishable from the Lutheran justification by faith andthe Wesleyan acceptance of free grace, is within the reach of persons who have no conviction of sin and care nothingfor the Lutheran theology. It is but giving your little private convulsive self a rest, and finding that a greater Self isthere. The results, slow or sudden, or great or small, of the combined optimism and expectancy, the regenerativephenomena which ensue on the abandonment of effort, remain firm facts of human nature, no matter whether weadopt a theistic, a pantheistic-idealistic, or a medical-materialistic view of their ultimate causal explanation.11The theistic explanation is by divine grace, which creates a new nature within one the moment the old nature is sincerely given up. Thepantheistic explanation (which is that of most mind-curers) is by the merging of the narrower private self into the wider or greater self,the spirit of the universe (which is your own 'subconscious' self), the moment the isolating barriers of(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP107 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 17]Page 107When we take up the phenomena of revivalistic conversion, we shall learn something more about all this. Meanwhile Iwill say a brief word about the mind-curer's methods.They are of course largely suggestive. The suggestive influence of environment plays an enormous part in all spiritualeducation. But the word 'suggestion,' having acquired official status, is unfortunately already beginning to play inmany quarters the part of a wet blanket upon investigation, being used to fend off all inquiry into the varyingsusceptibilities of individual cases. 'Suggestion' is only another name for the power of ideas, so far as they proveefficacious over belief and conduct. Ideas efficacious over some people prove inefficacious over others. Ideasefficacious at some times and in some human surroundings are not so at other times and elsewhere. The ideas ofChristian churches are not efficacious in the therapeutic direction to-day, whatever they may have been in earliercenturies; and when the whole question is as to why the salt has lost its savor here or gained it there, the mere blankwaving of the word 'suggestion' as if it were a banner gives no light. Dr. Goddard, whose candid psychological essayon Faith Cures ascribes them to nothing but ordinary suggestion, concludes by saying that \"Religion [and by this heseems to mean our popular Christianity] has in it all there is in mental therapeutics, and has it in its best form. Livingup to [our religious] ideas will do anything for us that can be done.\" And this in spite of the actual fact that the popularChristianity does absolutely nothing, or did nothing until mind-cure came to the rescue.1An idea, to be suggestive, must come to the individual with(Footnote continued from previous page)mistrust and anxiety are removed. The medico-materialistic explanation is that simpler cerebral processes act more freely where they areleft to act automatically by the shunting-out of physiologically (though in this instance not spiritually) 'higher' ones which, seeking toregulate, only succeed in inhibiting results.—Whether this third explanation might, in a psycho-physical account of the universe, becombined with either of the others may be left an open question here.1Within the churches a disposition has always prevailed to regard sickness as a visitation: something sent by God for our good, either aschastisement, as warning, or as opportunity for exercising virtue, and, in the Catholic Church, of earning 'merit.' \"Illness,\" says a goodCatholic writer (P.

The mind-cure with its gospel of healthy-mindedness has come as a revelation to manywhose hearts the church-Christianity had left hardened. It has let loose their springs of higher life. In what can theoriginality of any religious movement consist, save in finding a channel, until then sealed up, through which thosesprings may be set free in some group of human beings?The force of personal faith, enthusiasm, and example, and above all the force of novelty, are always the primesuggestive agency in this kind of success. If mind-cure should ever become official, respectable, and intrenched, theseelements of suggestive efficacy will be lost. In its acuter stages every(Footnote continued from previous page)Introd. à la Vie Mystique, 1899, p. 218), \"is the most excellent of corporeal mortifications, the mortification which one has not one's selfchosen, which is imposed directly by God, and is the direct expression of his will. 'If other mortifications are of silver,' Mgr. Gay says,'this one is of gold; since although it comes of ourselves, coming as it does of original sin, still on its greater side, as coming (like all thathappens) from the providence of God, it is of divine manufacture. And how just are its blows! And how efficacious it is! I do nothesitate to say that patience in a long illness is mortification's very masterpiece, and consequently the triumph of mortified souls.'\"According to this view, disease should in any case be submissively accepted, and it might under certain circumstances even beblasphemous to wish it away.Of course there have been exceptions to this, and cures by special miracle have at all times been recognized within the church's pale, almostall the great saints having more or less performed them. It was one of the heresies of Edward Irving, to maintain them still to be possible. Anextremely pure faculty of healing after confession and conversion on the patient's part, and prayer on the priest's, was quite spontaneouslydeveloped in the German pastor, Joh. Christoph Blumhardt, in the early forties and exerted during nearly thirty years. Blumhardt's Life byZündel (5th edition, Zurich, 1887) gives in chapters ix., x., xi., and xvii. a pretty full account of his healing activity, which he invariablyascribed to direct divine interposition. Blumhardt was a singularly pure, simple, and non-fanatical character, and in this part of his workfollowed no previous model. In Chicago to-day we have the case of Dr. J. A. Dowie, a Scottish Baptist preacher, whose weekly 'Leaves ofHealing' were in the year of grace 1900 in their sixth volume, and who, although he denounces the cures wrought in other sects as 'diabolicalcounterfeits' of his own exclusively 'Divine Healing,' must on the whole be counted into the mind-cure movement. In mind-cure circles thefundamental article of faith is that disease should never be accepted. It is wholly of the pit. God wants us to be absolutely healthy, and weshould not tolerate ourselves on any lower terms."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP109 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 20]Page 109religion must be a homeless Arab of the desert. The church knows this well enough, with its everlasting inner struggleof the acute religion of the few against the chronic religion of the many, indurated into an obstructiveness worse thanthat which irreligion opposes to the movings of the Spirit. \"We may pray,\" says Jonathan Edwards, \"concerning allthose saints that are not lively Christians, that they may either be enlivened, or taken away; if that be true that is oftensaid by some at this day, that these cold dead saints do more hurt than natural men, and lead more souls to hell, andthat it would be well for mankind if they were all dead.\"1The next condition of success is the apparent existence, in large numbers, of minds who unite healthy-mindednesswith readiness for regeneration by letting go. Protestantism has been too pessimistic as regards the natural man,Catholicism has been too legalistic and moralistic, for either the one or the other to appeal in any generous way to thetype of character formed of this peculiar mingling of elements. However few of us here present may belong to such atype, it is now evident that it forms a specific moral combination, well represented in the world.Finally, mind-cure has made what in our protestant countries is an unprecedentedly great use of the subconscious life.To their reasoned advice and dogmatic assertion, its founders have added systematic exercise in passive relaxation,concentration, and meditation, and have even invoked something like hypnotic practice. I quote some passages atrandom:—\"The value, the potency of ideals is the great practical truth on which the New Thought most strongly insists,—the development namelyfrom within outward, from small to great.2 Consequently one's thought should be centred on the ideal outcome, even though this trust beliterally like a step in the dark.3 To attain the ability thus effec-1Edwards, from whose book on the Revival in New England I quote these words, dissuades from such a use of prayer, but it is easy tosee that he enjoys making his thrust at the cold dead church-members.2H.W.

One isto learn to marshal the tendencies of the mind, so that they may be held together as a unit by the chosen ideal. To this end, one should setapart times for silent meditation, by one's self, preferably in a room where the surroundings are favorable to spiritual thought. In NewThought terms, this is called 'entering the silence.'\"1\"The time will come when in the busy office or on the noisy street you can enter into the silence by simply drawing the mantle of yourown thoughts about you and realizing that there and everywhere the Spirit of Infinite Life, Love, Wisdom, Peace, Power, and Plenty isguiding, keeping, protecting, leading you. This is the spirit of continual prayer.2 One of the most intuitive men we ever met had a desk ata city office where several other gentlemen were doing business constantly, and often talking loudly. Entirely undisturbed by the manyvarious sounds about him, this self-centred faithful man would, in any moment of perplexity, draw the curtains of privacy so completelyabout him that he would be as fully inclosed in his own psychic aura, and thereby as effectually removed from all distractions, as thoughhe were alone in some primeval wood. Taking his difficulty with him into the mystic silence in the form of a direct question, to whichhe expected a certain answer, he would remain utterly passive until the reply came, and never once through many years' experience didhe find himself disappointed or misled.\"3Wherein, I should like to know, does this intrinsically differ from the practice of 'recollection' which plays so great apart in Catholic discipline? Otherwise called the practice of the presence of God (and so known among ourselves, asfor instance in Jeremy Taylor), it is thus defined by the eminent teacher Alvarez de Paz in his work on Contemplation.1DRESSER: Voices of Freedom, 33.2TRINE: In Tune with the Infinite, p. 214.3TRINE: p. 117."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP111 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 28]Page 111\"It is the recollection of God, the thought of God, which in all places and circumstances makes us see him present, lets us communerespectfully and lovingly with him, and fills us with desire and affection for him. Would you escape from every ill? Never lose thisrecollection of God, neither in prosperity nor in adversity, nor on any occasion whichsoever it be. Invoke not, to excuse yourself fromthis duty, either the difficulty or the importance of your business, for you can always remember that God sees you, that you are under hiseye. If a thousand times an hour you forget him, reanimate a thousand times the recollection. If you cannot practice this exercisecontinuously, at least make yourself as familiar with it as possible; and, like unto those who in a rigorous winter draw near the fire asoften as they can, go as often as you can to that ardent fire which will warm your soul.\"1All the external associations of the Catholic discipline are of course unlike anything in mind-cure thought, but thepurely spiritual part of the exercise is identical in both communions, and in both communions those who urge it writewith authority, for they have evidently experienced in their own persons that whereof they tell. Compare again somemind-cure utterances:—\"High, healthful, pure thinking can be encouraged, promoted, and strengthened. Its current can be turned upon grand ideals until it formsa habit and wears a channel. By means of such discipline the mental horizon can be flooded with the sunshine of beauty, wholeness, andharmony. To inaugurate pure and lofty thinking may at first seem difficult, even almost mechanical, but perseverance will at lengthrender it easy, then pleasant, and finally delightful.\"The soul's real world is that which it has built of its thoughts, mental states, and imaginations.

Whenever the thought isnot occupied with one's daily duty or profession, it should be sent aloft into the spiritual atmosphere. There are quiet leisure moments byday, and wakeful hours at night, when this wholesome and delightful exercise may be engaged in to great advantage. If one who hasnever made any systematic effort to lift and control the thought-forces will, for a single month, earnestly pursue the course heresuggested, he will be surprised and delighted at the result, and nothing will induce him to go back to careless, aimless, and superficialthinking. At such favorable seasons the outside world, with all its current of daily events, is barred out, and one goes into the silentsanctuary of the inner temple of soul to commune and aspire. The spiritual hearing becomes delicately sensitive, so that the 'still, smallvoice' is audible, the tumultuous waves of external sense are hushed, and there is a great calm. The ego gradually becomes conscious thatit is face to face with the Divine Presence; that mighty, healing, loving, Fatherly life which is nearer to us than we are to ourselves.There is soul-contact with the Parent-Soul, and an influx of life, love, virtue, health, and happiness from the Inexhaustible Fountain.\"1When we reach the subject of mysticism, you will undergo so deep an immersion into these exalted states ofconsciousness as to be wet all over, if I may so express myself; and the cold shiver of doubt with which this littlesprinkling may affect you will have long since passed away—doubt, I mean, as to whether all such writing be notmere abstract talk and rhetoric set down pour encourager les autres. You will then be convinced, I trust, that thesestates of consciousness of 'union' form a perfectly definite class of experiences, of which the soul may occasionallypartake, and which certain persons may live by in a deeper sense than they live by anything else with which they haveacquaintance. This brings me to a general philosophical reflection with which I should1HENRY WOOD: Ideal Suggestion through Mental Photography, pp. 51, 70 (abridged)."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP113 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 41]Page 113like to pass from the subject of healthy-mindedness, and close a topic which I fear is already only too long drawn out.It concerns the relation of all this systematized healthy-mindedness and mind-cure religion to scientific method andthe scientific life.In a later lecture I shall have to treat explicitly of the relation of religion to science on the one hand, and to primevalsavage thought on the other. There are plenty of persons today—'scientists' or 'positivists,' they are fond of callingthemselves—who will tell you that religious thought is a mere survival, an atavistic reversion to a type ofconsciousness which humanity in its more enlightened examples has long since left behind and outgrown. If you askthem to explain themselves more fully, they will probably say that for primitive thought everything is conceived ofunder the form of personality. The savage thinks that things operate by personal forces, and for the sake of individualends. For him, even external nature obeys individual needs and claims, just as if these were so many elementarypowers. Now science, on the other hand, these positivists say, has proved that personality, so far from being anelementary force in nature, is but a passive resultant of the really elementary forces, physical, chemical, physiological,and psycho-physical, which are all impersonal and general in character. Nothing individual accomplishes anything inthe universe save in so far as it obeys and exemplifies some universal law. Should you then inquire of them by whatmeans science has thus supplanted primitive thought, and discredited its personal way of looking at things, they wouldundoubtedly say it has been by the strict use of the method of experimental verification. Follow out science'sconceptions practically, they will say, the conceptions that ignore personality altogether, and you will always becorroborated. The world is so made that all your expectations will be experientially verified so long, and only so long,as you keep the terms from which you infer them impersonal and universal.But here we have mind-cure, with her diametrically opposite philosophy, setting up an exactly identical claim. Live asif I were true, she says, and every day will practically prove you right. That the controlling energies of nature are per-"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP114 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 42]Page 114sonal, that your own personal thoughts are forces, that the powers of the universe will directly respond to yourindividual appeals and needs, are propositions which your whole bodily and mental experience will verify. And thatexperience does largely verify these primeval religious ideas is proved by the fact that the mind-cure movementspreads as it does, not by proclamation and assertion simply, but by palpable experiential results. Here, in the veryheyday of science's authority, it carries on an aggressive warfare against the scientific philosophy, and succeeds byusing science's own peculiar methods and weapons. Believing that a higher power will take care of us in certain waysbetter than we can take care of ourselves, if we only genuinely throw ourselves upon it and consent to use it, it findsthe belief, not only not impugned, but corroborated by its observation.How conversions are thus made, and converts confirmed, is evident enough from the narratives which I have quoted.I will quote yet another couple of shorter ones to give the matter a perfectly concrete turn. Here is one:—''One of my first experiences in applying my teaching was two months after I first saw the healer. I fell, spraining my right ankle, which Ihad done once four years before, having then had to use a crutch and elastic anklet for some months, and carefully guarding it ever since.As soon as I was on my feet I made the positive suggestion (and felt it through all my being): 'There is nothing but God, all life comesfrom him perfectly. I cannot be sprained or hurt, I will let him take care of it.' Well, I never had a sensation in it, and I walked two milesthat day.\"The next case not only illustrates experiment and verification, but also the element of passivity and surrender of whichawhile ago I made such account.\"I went into town to do some shopping one morning, and I had not been gone long before I began to feel ill. The ill feeling increasedrapidly, until I had pains in all my bones, nausea and faintness, headache, all the symptoms in short that precede an attack of influenza. Ithought that I was going to have the grippe, epidemic then in Boston,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP115 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 43]Page 115or something worse. The mind-cure teachings that I had been listening to all the winter thereupon came into my mind, and I thought thathere was an opportunity to test myself. On my way home I met a friend, and I refrained with some effort from telling her how I felt. Thatwas the first step gained. I went to bed immediately, and my husband wished to send for the doctor. But I told him that I would ratherwait until morning and see how I felt. Then followed one of the most beautiful experiences of my life.\"I cannot express it in any other way than to say that I did 'lie down in the stream of life and let it flow over me.' I gave up all fear of anyimpending disease; I was perfectly willing and obedient. There was no intellectual effort, or train of thought. My dominant idea was:'Behold the hand-maid of the Lord: be it unto me even as thou wilt,' and a perfect confidence that all would be well, that all was well.The creative life was flowing into me every instant, and I felt myself allied with the Infinite, in harmony, and full of the peace thatpasseth understanding. There was no place in my mind for a jarring body. I had no consciousness of time or space or persons; but only oflove and happiness and faith.\"I do not know how long this state lasted, nor when I fell asleep; but when I woke up in the morning, I was well.\"These are exceedingly trivial instances,1 but in them, if we have anything at all, we have the method of experimentand verification. For the point I am driving at now, it makes no difference whether you consider the patients to bedeluded victims of their imagination or not. That they seemed to themselves to have been cured by the experimentstried was enough to make them converts to the system. And although it is evident that one must be of a certain mentalmould to get such results (for not every one can get thus cured to his own satisfaction any more than every one can becured by the first regular practitioner whom he calls in), yet it would surely be pedantic and over-scrupulous for thosewho can get their savage and primitive philosophy of mental healing verified in such experimental ways as this, togive them up at word of1See Appendix to this lecture for two other cases furnished me by friends."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP116 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 45]Page 116command for more scientific therapeutics. What are we to think of all this? Has science made too wide a claim?I believe that the claims of the sectarian scientist are, to say the least, premature. The experiences which we have beenstudying during this hour (and a great many other kinds of religious experiences are like them) plainly show theuniverse to be a more many-sided affair than any sect, even the scientific sect, allows for. What, in the end, are all ourverifications but experiences that agree with more or less isolated systems of ideas (conceptual systems) that our mindshave framed? But why in the name of common sense need we assume that only one such system of ideas can be true?The obvious outcome of our total experience is that the world can be handled according to many systems of ideas, andis so handled by different men, and will each time give some characteristic kind of profit, for which he cares, to thehandler, while at the same time some other kind of profit has to be omitted or postponed. Science gives to all of ustelegraphy, electric lighting, and diagnosis, and succeeds in preventing and curing a certain amount of disease.Religion in the shape of mind-cure gives to some of us serenity, moral poise, and happiness, and prevents certainforms of disease as well as science does, or even better in a certain class of persons. Evidently, then, the science andthe religion are both of them genuine keys for unlocking the world's treasure-house to him who can use either of thempractically. Just as evidently neither is exhaustive or exclusive of the other's simultaneous use. And why, after all, maynot the world be so complex as to consist of many interpenetrating spheres of reality, which we can thus approach inalternation by using different conceptions and assuming different attitudes, just as mathematicians handle the samenumerical and spatial facts by geometry, by analytical geometry, by algebra, by the calculus, or by quaternions, andeach time come out right? On this view religion and science, each verified in its own way from hour to hour and fromlife to life, would be coeternal. Primitive thought, with its belief in individualized personal forces, seems at any rate asfar as ever from being driven by science from the field to-day.

In a later lecture therelations of religion both to science and to primitive thought will have to receive much more explicit attention.Appendix(See note to p. 115.)CASE I. \"My own experience is this: I had long been ill, and one of the first results of my illness, a dozen years before,had been a diplopia which deprived me of the use of my eyes for reading and writing almost entirely, while a laterone had been to shut me out from exercise of any kind under penalty of immediate and great exhaustion. I had beenunder the care of doctors of the highest standing both in Europe and America, men in whose power to help me I hadhad great faith, with no or ill result. Then, at a time when I seemed to be rather rapidly losing ground, I heard somethings that gave me interest enough in mental healing to make me try it; I had no great hope of getting any good fromit—it was a chance I tried, partly because my thought was interested by the new possibility it seemed to open, partlybecause it was the only chance I then could see.

Ibelieved from the start in the possibility of such action, for I knew the power of the mind to shape, helping orhindering, the body's nerve-activities, and I thought telepathy probable, although unproved, but I had no belief in it asmore than a possibility, and no strong conviction nor any mystic or religious faith connected with my thought of it thatmight have brought imagination strongly into play.\"I sat quietly with the healer for half an hour each day, at first with no result; then, after ten days or so, I became quitesuddenly and swiftly conscious of a tide of new energy rising within me, a sense of power to pass beyond old halting-places, of power to break the bounds that, though often tried before, had long been veritable walls about my life, toohigh to climb. I began to read and walk as I had not done for years, and the change was sudden, marked, andunmistakable. This tide seemed to mount for some weeks, three or four perhaps, when, summer having come, I cameaway, taking the treatment up again a few months later. The lift I got proved permanent, and left me slowly gainingground instead of losing it, but with this lift the influence seemed in a way to have spent itself, and, though myconfidence in the reality of the power had gained immensely from this first experience, and should have helped me tomake further gain in health and strength if my belief in it had been the potent factor there, I never after this got anyresult at all as striking or as clearly marked as this which came when I made trial of it first, with little faith anddoubtful expectation. It is difficult to put all the evidence in such a matter into words, to gather up into a distinctstatement all that one bases one's conclusions on, but I have always felt that I had abundant evidence to justify (tomyself, at least) the conclusion that I came to then, and since have held to, that the physical change which came at thattime was, first, the result of a change wrought within me by a change of mental state; and, secondly, that that changeof mental state was not, save in a very secondary way, brought about through the influence of an excited imagination,or a consciously received suggestion of an hypnotic sort.

In my case the disease was distinctly what would be classed as nervous,not organic; but from such opportunities as I have had of observing, I have come to the conclusion that the dividingline that has been drawn is an arbitrary one, the nerves controlling the internal activities and the nutrition of the bodythroughout; and I believe that the central nervous system, by starting and inhibiting local centres, can exercise a vastinfluence upon disease of any kind, if it can be brought to bear. In my judgment the question is simply how to bring itto bear, and I think that the uncertainty and remarkable differences in the results obtained through mental healing dobut show how ignorant we are as yet of the forces at work and of the means we should take to make them effective.That these results are not due to chance coincidences my observation of myself and others makes me sure; that theconscious mind, the imagination, enters into them as a factor in many cases is doubtless true, but in many others, andsometimes very extraordinary ones, it hardly seems to enter in at all. On the whole I am inclined to think that as thehealing action, like the morbid one, springs from the plane of the normally unconscious mind, so the strongest andmost effective impressions are those which it receives, in some as yet unknown, subtle way, directly from a healthiermind whose state, through a hidden law of sympathy, it reproduces.\"CASE II. \"At the urgent request of friends, and with no faith and hardly any hope (possibly owing to a previousunsuccessful experience with a Christian Scientist), our little daughter was placed under the care of a healer, andcured of a trouble about which the physician had been very discouraging in his diagnosis.

We saw how this temperament may become the basis for apeculiar type of religion, a religion in which good, even the good of this world's life, is regarded as the essential thingfor a rational being to attend to. This religion directs him to settle his scores with the more evil aspects of the universeby systematically declining to lay them to heart or make much of them, by ignoring them in his reflective calculations,or even, on occasion, by denying outright that they exist. Evil is a disease; and worry over disease is itself anadditional form of disease, which only adds to the original complaint. Even repentance and remorse, affections whichcome in the character of ministers of good, may be but sickly and relaxing impulses. The best repentance is to up andact for righteousness, and forget that you ever had relations with sin.Spinoza's philosophy has this sort of healthy-mindedness woven into the heart of it, and this has been one secret of itsfascination. He whom Reason leads, according to Spinoza, is led altogether by the influence over his mind of good.Knowledge of evil is an 'inadequate' knowledge, fit only for slavish minds. So Spinoza categorically condemnsrepentance. When men make mistakes, he says,—\"One might perhaps expect gnawings of conscience and repentance to help to bring them on the right path, and might thereupon conclude(as every one does conclude) that these affections are good things. Yet when we look at the matter closely, we shall find that not only arethey not good, but on the contrary deleterious and evil passions. For it is manifest that we can always get along better by reason and loveof truth than by worry of conscience and remorse. Harmful are these and evil, inasmuch as they form a par-"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP122 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 52]Page 122ticular kind of sadness; and the disadvantages of sadness,\" he continues, \"I have already proved, and shown that we should strive to keepit from our life. Just so we should endeavor, since uneasiness of conscience and remorse are of this kind of complexion, to flee and shunthese states of mind.\"1Within the Christian body, for which repentance of sins has from the beginning been the critical religious act, healthy-mindedness has always come forward with its milder inter-pretation. Repentance according to such healthy-mindedChristians means getting away from the sin, not groaning and writhing over its commission. The Catholic practice ofconfession and absolution is in one of its aspects little more than a systematic method of keeping healthy-mindednesson top. By it a man's accounts with evil are periodically squared and audited, so that he may start the clean page withno old debts inscribed. Any Catholic will tell us how clean and fresh and free he feels after the purging operation.Martin Luther by no means belonged to the healthy-minded type in the radical sense in which we have discussed it,and he repudiated priestly absolution for sin. Yet in this matter of repentance he had some very healthy-minded ideas,due in the main to the largeness of his conception of God.\"When I was a monk,\" he says, \"I thought that I was utterly cast away, if at any time I felt the lust of the flesh: that is to say, if I felt anyevil motion, fleshly lust, wrath, hatred, or envy against any brother. I assayed many ways to help to quiet my conscience, but it would notbe; for the concupiscence and lust of my flesh did always return, so that I could not rest, but was continually vexed with these thoughts:This or that sin thou hast committed: thou art infected with envy, with impatiency, and such other sins: therefore thou art entered intothis holy order in vain, and all thy good works are unprofitable. But if then I had rightly understood these sentences of Paul: 'The fleshlusteth contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh; and these two are one against another, so that ye1Tract on God, Man, and Happiness, Book ii. ch. x."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP123 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 53]Page 123cannot do the things that ye would do,' I should not have so miserably tormented myself, but should have thought and said to myself, asnow commonly I do, 'Martin, thou shalt not utterly be without sin, for thou hast flesh; thou shalt therefore feel the battle thereof.' Iremember that Staupitz was wont to say, 'I have vowed unto God above a thousand times that I would become a better man: but I neverperformed that which I vowed. Hereafter I will make no such vow: for I have now learned by experience that I am not able to perform it.Unless, therefore, God be favorable and merciful unto me for Christ's sake, I shall not be able, with all my vows and all my good deeds,to stand before him.' This (of Staupitz's) was not only a true, but also a godly and a holy desperation; and this must they all confess, bothwith mouth and heart, who will be saved. For the godly trust not to their own righteousness. They look unto Christ their reconciler, whogave his life for their sins. Moreover, they know that the remnant of sin which is in their flesh is not laid to their charge, but freelypardoned. Notwithstanding, in the mean while they fight in spirit against the flesh, lest they should fulfill the lusts thereof; and althoughthey feel the flesh to rage and rebel, and themselves also do fall sometimes into sin through infirmity, yet are they not discouraged, northink therefore that their state and kind of life, and the works which are done according to their calling, displease God; but they raise upthemselves by faith.\"1One of the heresies for which the Jesuits got that spiritual genius, Molinos, the founder of Quietism, so abominablycondemned was his healthy-minded opinion of repentance:—\"When thou fallest into a fault, in what matter soever it be, do not trouble nor afflict thyself for it. For they are effects of our frail Nature,stained by Original Sin. The common enemy will make thee believe, as soon as thou fallest into any fault, that thou walkest in error, andtherefore art out of God and his favor, and herewith would he make thee distrust of the divine Grace, telling thee of thy1Commentary on Galatians, Philadelphia, 1891, pp. 510 514 (abridged)."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP124 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 55]Page 124misery, and making a giant of it; and putting it into thy head that every day thy soul grows worse instead of better, whilst it so oftenrepeats these failings. O blessed Soul, open thine eyes; and shut the gate against these diabolical suggestions, knowing thy misery, andtrusting in the mercy divine. Would not he be a mere fool who, running at tournament with others, and falling in the best of the career,should lie weeping on the ground and afflicting himself with discourses upon his fall? Man (they would tell him), lose no time, get up andtake the course again, for he that rises again quickly and continues his race is as if he had never fallen. If thou seest thyself fallen onceand a thousand times, thou oughtest to make use of the remedy which I have given thee, that is, a loving confidence in the divine mercy.These are the weapons with which thou must fight and conquer cowardice and vain thoughts. This is the means thou oughtest to use—not to lose time, not to disturb thyself, and reap no good.''1Now in contrast with such healthy-minded views as these, if we treat them as a way of deliberately minimizing evil,stands a radically opposite view, a way of maximizing evil, if you please so to call it, based on the persuasion that theevil aspects of our life are of its very essence, and that the world's meaning most comes home to us when we lay themmost to heart. We have now to address ourselves to this more morbid way of looking at the situation. But as I closedour last hour with a general philosophical reflection on the healthy-minded way of taking life, I should like at thispoint to make another philosophical reflection upon it before turning to that heavier task. You will excuse the briefdelay.If we admit that evil is an essential part of our being and the key to the interpretation of our life, we load ourselvesdown with a difficulty that has always proved burdensome in philosophies of religion. Theism, whenever it haserected itself into a systematic philosophy of the universe, has shown a reluctance to let God be anything less thanAll-in-All. In other words, philosophic theism has always shown a tendency to become pantheistic and monistic, andto consider the world1MOLINOS: Spiritual Guide, Book II., chaps. xvii., xviii. (abridged)."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP125 hl[27 02 2011 00 31 56]Page 125as one unit of absolute fact; and this has been at variance with popular or practical theism, which latter has ever beenmore or less frankly pluralistic, not to say polytheistic, and shown itself perfectly well satisfied with a universecomposed of many original principles, provided we be only allowed to believe that the divine principle remainssupreme, and that the others are subordinate. In this latter case God is not necessarily responsible for the existence ofevil; he would only be responsible if it were not finally overcome. But on the monistic or pantheistic view, evil, likeeverything else, must have its foundation in God; and the difficulty is to see how this can possibly be the case if Godbe absolutely good. This difficulty faces us in every form of philosophy in which the world appears as one flawlessunit of fact. Such a unit is an Individual, and in it the worst parts must be as essential as the best, must be asnecessary to make the individual what he is; since if any part whatever in an individual were to vanish or alter, itwould no longer be that individual at all. The philosophy of absolute idealism, so vigorously represented both inScotland and America to-day, has to struggle with this difficulty quite as much as scholastic theism struggled in itstime; and although it would be premature to say that there is no speculative issue whatever from the puzzle, it isperfectly fair to say that there is no clear or easy issue, and that the only obvious escape from paradox here is to cutloose from the monistic assumption altogether, and to allow the world to have existed from its origin in pluralisticform, as an aggregate or collection of higher and lower things and principles, rather than an absolutely unitary fact.For then evil would not need to be essential; it might be, and may always have been, an independent portion that hadno rational or absolute right to live with the rest, and which we might conceivably hope to see got rid of at last.Now the gospel of healthy-mindedness, as we have described it, casts its vote distinctly for this pluralistic view.Whereas the monistic philosopher finds himself more or less bound to say, as Hegel said, that everything actual isrational, and that evil, as an element dialectically required, must be pinned in and kept and consecrated and have afunction awarded to it in the final system of truth, healthy-mindedness"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP126 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 03]Page 126refuses to say anything of the sort.1 Evil, it says, is emphatically irrational, and not to be pinned in, or preserved, orconsecrated in any final system of truth. It is a pure abomination to the Lord, an alien unreality, a waste element, tobe sloughed off and negated, and the very memory of it, if possible, wiped out and forgotten. The ideal, so far frombeing co-extensive with the whole actual, is a mere extract from the actual, marked by its deliverance from all contactwith this diseased, inferior, and excrementitious stuff.Here we have the interesting notion fairly and squarely presented to us, of there being elements of the universe whichmay make no rational whole in conjunction with the other elements, and which, from the point of view of any systemwhich those other elements make up, can only be considered so much irrelevance and accident—so much 'dirt,' as itwere, and matter out of place. I ask you now not to forget this notion; for although most philosophers seem either toforget it or to disdain it too much ever to mention it, I believe that we shall have to admit it ourselves in the end ascontaining an element of truth. The mind-cure gospel thus once more appears to us as having dignity and importance.We have seen it to be a genuine religion, and no mere silly appeal to imagination to cure disease; we have seen itsmethod of all experimental verification to be not unlike the method of all science; and now here we find mind-cure asthe champion of a perfectly definite conception of the metaphysical structure of the world. I hope that, in view of allthis, you will not regret my having pressed it upon your attention at such length.Let us now say good-by for a while to all this way of thinking, and turn towards those persons who cannot so swiftlythrow off the burden of the consciousness of evil, but are congenitally fated to suffer from its presence. Just as we saw1I say this in spite of the monistic utterances of many mind-cure writers; for these utterances are really inconsistent with their attitudetowards disease, and can easily be shown not to be logically involved in the experiences of union with a higher Presence with whichthey connect themselves. The higher Presence, namely, need not be the absolute whole of things, it is quite sufficient for the life ofreligious experience to regard it as a part, if only it be the most ideal part."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP127 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 04]Page 127that in healthy-mindedness there are shallower and profounder levels, happiness like that of the mere animal, andmore regenerate sorts of happiness, so also are there different levels of the morbid mind, and the one is much moreformidable than the other. There are people for whom evil means only a mal-adjustment with things, a wrongcorrespondence of one's life with the environment. Such evil as this is curable, in principle at least, upon the naturalplane, for merely by modifying either the self or the things, or both at once, the two terms may be made to fit, and allgo merry as a marriage bell again. But there are others for whom evil is no mere relation of the subject to particularouter things, but something more radical and general, a wrongness or vice in his essential nature, which no alterationof the environment, or any superficial rearrangement of the inner self, can cure, and which requires a supernaturalremedy. On the whole, the Latin races have leaned more towards the former way of looking upon evil, as made up ofills and sins in the plural, removable in detail; while the Germanic races have tended rather to think of Sin in thesingular, and with a capital S, as of something ineradicably ingrained in our natural subjectivity, and never to beremoved by any superficial piecemeal operations.1 These comparisons of races are always open to exception, butundoubtedly the northern tone in religion has inclined to the more intimately pessimistic persuasion, and this way offeeling, being the more extreme, we shall find by far the more instructive for our study.Recent psychology has found great use for the word 'threshold' as a symbolic designation for the point at which onestate of mind passes into another. Thus we speak of the threshold of a man's consciousness in general, to indicate theamount of noise, pressure, or other outer stimulus which it takes to arouse his attention at all. One with a highthreshold will doze through an amount of racket by which one with a low threshold would be immediately waked.Similarly, when one is sensitive to small differences in any order of sensation, we say he has a low 'difference-threshold'—his mind easily steps over it into the consciousness of the differences in ques-1Cf. J. MILSAND: Luther et le Serf-Arbitre, 1884, passim."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP128 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 16]Page 128tion. And just so we might speak of a 'pain-threshold,' a 'fear-threshold,' a 'misery-threshold,' and find it quicklyoverpassed by the consciousness of some individuals, but lying too high in others to be often reached by theirconsciousness. The sanguine and healthy-minded live habitually on the sunny side of their misery-line, the depressedand melancholy live beyond it, in darkness and apprehension. There are men who seem to have started in life with abottle or two of champagne inscribed to their credit; whilst others seem to have been born close to the pain-threshold,which the slightest irritants fatally send them over.Does it not appear as if one who lived more habitually on one side of the pain-threshold might need a different sort ofreligion from one who habitually lived on the other? This question, of the relativity of different types of religion todifferent types of need, arises naturally at this point, and will become a serious problem ere we have done. But beforewe confront it in general terms, we must address ourselves to the unpleasant task of hearing what the sick souls, as wemay call them in contrast to the healthy-minded, have to say of the secrets of their prison-house, their own peculiarform of consciousness. Let us then resolutely turn our backs on the once-born and their sky-blue optimistic gospel; letus not simply cry out, in spite of all appearances, \"Hurrah for the Universe!—God's in his Heaven, all's right with theworld.\" Let us see rather whether pity, pain, and fear, and the sentiment of human helplessness may not open aprofounder view and put into our hands a more complicated key to the meaning of the situation.To begin with, how can things so insecure as the successful experiences of this world afford a stable anchorage? Achain is no stronger than its weakest link, and life is after all a chain. In the healthiest and most prosperous existence,how many links of illness, danger, and disaster are always interposed? Unsuspectedly from the bottom of everyfountain of pleasure, as the old poet said, something bitter rises up: a touch of nausea, a falling dead of the delight, awhiff of melancholy, things that sound a knell, for fugitive as they may be, they bring a feeling of coming from adeeper region and often"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP129 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 17]Page 129have an appalling convincingness. The buzz of life ceases at their touch as a piano-string stops sounding when thedamper falls upon it.Of course the music can commence again;—and again and again,—at intervals. But with this the healthy-mindedconsciousness is left with an irremediable sense of precariousness. It is a bell with a crack; it draws its breath onsufferance and by an accident.Even if we suppose a man so packed with healthy-mindedness as never to have experienced in his own person any ofthese sobering intervals, still, if he is a reflecting being, he must generalize and class his own lot with that of others;and, doing so, he must see that his escape is just a lucky chance and no essential difference. He might just as wellhave been born to an entirely different fortune. And then indeed the hollow security! What kind of a frame of thingsis it of which the best you can say is, \"Thank God, it has let me off clear this time!\" Is not its blessedness a fragilefiction? Is not your joy in it a very vulgar glee, not much unlike the snicker of any rogue at his success? If indeed itwere all success, even on such terms as that! But take the happiest man, the one most envied by the world, and in ninecases out of ten his inmost consciousness is one of failure. Either his ideals in the line of his achievements are pitchedfar higher than the achievements themselves, or else he has secret ideals of which the world knows nothing, and inregard to which he inwardly knows himself to be found wanting.When such a conquering optimist as Goethe can express himself in this wise, how must it be with less successfulmen?\"I will say nothing,\" writes Goethe in 1824, \"against the course of my existence. But at bottom it has been nothing but pain and burden,and I can affirm that during the whole of my 75 years, I have not had four weeks of genuine well-being. It is but the perpetual rolling of arock that must be raised up again forever.\"What single-handed man was ever on the whole as successful as Luther? yet when he had grown old, he looked backon his life as if it were an absolute failure."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP130 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 19]Page 130\"I am utterly weary of life. I pray the Lord will come forthwith and carry me hence. Let him come, above all, with his last Judgment: Iwill stretch out my neck, the thunder will burst forth, and I shall be at rest.\"—And having a necklace of white agates in his hand at thetime he added: \"Oh God, grant that it may come without delay. I would readily eat up this necklace to-day, for the Judgment to come to-morrow.\"—The Electress Dowager, one day when Luther was dining with her, said to him: \"Doctor, I wish you may live forty years tocome.\" \"Madam,'' replied he, \"rather than live forty years more, I would give up my chance of Paradise.\"Failure, then, failure! so the world stamps us at every turn. We strew it with our blunders, our misdeeds, our lostopportunities, with all the memorials of our inadequacy to our vocation. And with what a damning emphasis does itthen blot us out! No easy fine, no mere apology or formal expiation, will satisfy the world's demands, but every poundof flesh exacted is soaked with all its blood. The subtlest forms of suffering known to man are connected with thepoisonous humiliations incidental to these results.And they are pivotal human experiences. A process so ubiquitous and everlasting is evidently an integral part of life.\"There is indeed one element in human destiny,\" Robert Louis Stevenson writes, \"that not blindness itself cancontrovert. Whatever else we are intended to do, we are not intended to succeed; failure is the fate allotted.\"1 And ournature being thus rooted in failure, is it any wonder that theologians should have held it to be essential, and thoughtthat only through the personal experience of humiliation which it engenders the deeper sense of life's significance isreached?21He adds with characteristic healthy-mindedness: \"Our business is to continue to fail in good spirits.\"2The God of many men is little more than their court of appeal against the damnatory judgment passed on their failures by the opinion of thisworld. To our own consciousness there is usually a residuum of worth left over after our sins and errors have been told off—our capacity ofacknowledging and regretting them is the germ of a better self in posse at least. But the world deals(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP131 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 20]Page 131But this is only the first stage of the world-sickness. Make the human being's sensitiveness a little greater, carry him alittle farther over the misery-threshold, and the good quality of the successful moments themselves when they occur isspoiled and vitiated. All natural goods perish. Riches take wings; fame is a breath; love is a cheat; youth and healthand pleasure vanish. Can things whose end is always dust and disappointment be the real goods which our soulsrequire? Back of everything is the great spectre of universal death, the all-encompassing blackness:—\"What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the Sun? I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, andbehold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; as the one dieth, so dieth the other;all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. The dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of themis forgotten. Also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in anythingthat is done under the Sun. Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the Sun: but if a man live many yearsand rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many.\"In short, life and its negation are beaten up inextricably together. But if the life be good, the negation of it must bebad. Yet the two are equally essential facts of existence; and all natural happiness thus seems infected with acontradiction. The breath of the sepulchre surrounds it.To a mind attentive to this state of things and rightly subject to the joy-destroying chill which such a contemplationengenders, the only relief that healthy-mindedness can give is(Footnote continued from previous page)with us in actu and not in posse: and of this hidden germ, not to be guessed at from without, it never takes account. Then we turn to theAll-knower, who knows our bad, but knows this good in us also, and who is just. We cast ourselves with our repentance on his mercy:only by an All-knower can we finally be judged. So the need of a God very definitely emerges from this sort of experience of life."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP132 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 21]Page 132by saying: 'Stuff and nonsense, get out into the open air!' or 'Cheer up, old fellow, you'll be all right erelong, if youwill only drop your morbidness!' But in all seriousness, can such bald animal talk as that be treated as a rationalanswer? To ascribe religious value to mere happy-go-lucky contentment with one's brief chance at natural good is butthe very consecration of forgetfulness and superficiality. Our troubles lie indeed too deep for that cure. The fact thatwe can die, that we can be ill at all, is what perplexes us; that fact that we now for a moment live and are well isirrelevant to that perplexity. We need a life not correlated with death, a health not liable to illness, a kind of good thatwill not perish, a good in fact that flies beyond the Goods of nature.It all depends on how sensitive the soul may become to discords. \"The trouble with me is that I believe too much incommon happiness and goodness,\" said a friend of mine whose consciousness was of this sort, \"and nothing canconsole me for their transiency. I am appalled and disconcerted at its being possible.\" And so with most of us: a littlecooling down of animal excitability and instinct, a little loss of animal toughness, a little irritable weakness anddescent of the pain-threshold, will bring the worm at the core of all our usual springs of delight into full view, andturn us into melancholy metaphysicians. The pride of life and glory of the world will shrivel. It is after all but thestanding quarrel of hot youth and hoary eld. Old age has the last word: the purely naturalistic look at life, howeverenthusiastically it may begin, is sure to end in sadness.This sadness lies at the heart of every merely positivistic, agnostic, or naturalistic scheme of philosophy. Let sanguinehealthy-mindedness do its best with its strange power of living in the moment and ignoring and forgetting, still theevil background is really there to be thought of, and the skull will grin in at the banquet. In the practical life of theindividual, we know how his whole gloom or glee about any present fact depends on the remoter schemes and hopeswith which it stands related. Its significance and framing give it the chief part of its value. Let it be known to leadnowhere, and however agreeable it may be in its immediacy, its glow and gilding vanish.

They are partners of death and the worm istheir brother, and they turn to a mere flatness.The lustre of the present hour is always borrowed from the background of possibilities it goes with. Let our commonexperiences be enveloped in an eternal moral order; let our suffering have an immortal significance; let Heaven smileupon the earth, and deities pay their visits; let faith and hope be the atmosphere which man breathes in;—and his dayspass by with zest; they stir with prospects, they thrill with remoter values. Place around them on the contrary thecurdling cold and gloom and absence of all permanent meaning which for pure naturalism and the popular scienceevolutionism of our time are all that is visible ultimately, and the thrill stops short, or turns rather to an anxioustrembling.For naturalism, fed on recent cosmological speculations, mankind is in a position similar to that of a set of peopleliving on a frozen lake, surrounded by cliffs over which there is no escape, yet knowing that little by little the ice ismelting, and the inevitable day drawing near when the last film of it will disappear, and to be drowned ignominiouslywill be the human creature's portion. The merrier the skating, the warmer and more sparkling the sun by day, and theruddier the bonfires at night, the more poignant the sadness with which one must take in the meaning of the totalsituation.The early Greeks are continually held up to us in literary works as models of the healthy-minded joyousness whichthe religion of nature may engender. There was indeed much joyousness among the Greeks—Homer's flow ofenthusiasm for most things that the sun shines upon is steady. But even in Homer the reflective passages arecheerless,1 and the moment the Greeks grew systematically pensive and thought of ultimates, they became unmitigatedpessimists.2 The jealousy of the gods, the nemesis that follows too much happiness, the1E. g., Iliad, XVII. 446: \"Nothing then is more wretched anywhere than man of all that breathes and creeps upon this earth.\"2E. g., Theognis, 425 428: \"Best of all for all things upon earth is it not to be born not to behold the splendors of the Sun; next best to traverseas(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP134 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 24]Page 134all-encompassing death, fate's dark opacity, the ultimate and unintelligible cruelty, were the fixed background of theirimagination. The beautiful joyousness of their polytheism is only a poetic modern fiction. They knew no joyscomparable in quality of preciousness to those which we shall erelong see that Brahmans, Buddhists, Christians,Mohammedans, twice-born people whose religion is non-naturalistic, get from their several creeds of mysticism andrenunciation.Stoic insensibility and Epicurean resignation were the farthest advance which the Greek mind made in that direction.The Epicurean said: \"Seek not to be happy, but rather to escape unhappiness; strong happiness is always linked withpain; therefore hug the safe shore, and do not tempt the deeper raptures. Avoid disappointment by expecting little, andby aiming low; and above all do not fret.\" The Stoic said: \"The only genuine good that life can yield a man is the freepossession of his own soul; all other goods are lies.\" Each of these philosophies is in its degree a philosophy ofdespair in nature's boons. Trustful self-abandonment to the joys that freely offer has entirely departed from bothEpicurean and Stoic; and what each proposes is a way of rescue(Footnote continued from previous page)soon as possible the gates of Hades.\" See also the almost identical passage in dipus in Colonus, 1225.—The Anthology is full ofpessimistic utterances: \"Naked came I upon the earth, naked I go below the ground—why then do I vainly toil when I see the end nakedbefore me?\" — \"How did I come to be? Whence am I? Wherefore did I come? To pass away. How can I learn aught when naught Iknow? Being naught I came to life: once more shall I be what I was. Nothing and nothingness is the whole race of mortals.\"—\"For deathwe are all cherished and fattened like a herd of hogs that is wantonly butchered.\"The difference between Greek pessimism and the oriental and modern variety is that the Greeks had not made the discovery that the patheticmood may be idealized, and figure as a higher form of sensibility. Their spirit was still too essentially masculine for pessimism to beelaborated or lengthily dwelt on in their classic literature. They would have despised a life set wholly in a minor key, and summoned it tokeep within the proper bounds of lachrymosity. They discovery that the enduring emphasis, so far as this world goes, may be laid on its painand failure, was reserved for races more complex, and (so to speak) more feminine than the Hellenes had attained to being in the classicperiod. But all the same was the outlook of those Hellenes blackly pessimistic."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP135 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 25]Page 135from the resultant dust-and-ashes state of mind. The Epicurean still awaits results from economy of indulgence anddamping of desire. The Stoic hopes for no results, and gives up natural good altogether. There is dignity in both theseforms of resignation. They represent distinct stages in the sobering process which man's primitive intoxication withsense-happiness is sure to undergo. In the one the hot blood has grown cool, in the other it has become quite cold; andalthough I have spoken of them in the past tense, as if they were merely historic, yet Stoicism and Epicureanism willprobably be to all time typical attitudes, marking a certain definite stage accomplished in the evolution of the world-sick soul.1 They mark the conclusion of what we call the once-born period, and represent the highest flights of whattwice-born religion would call the purely natural man—Epicureanism, which can only by great courtesy be called areligion, showing his refinement, and Stoicism exhibiting his moral will. They leave the world in the shape of anunreconciled contradiction, and seek no higher unity. Compared with the complex ecstasies which the supernaturallyregenerated Christian may enjoy, or the oriental pantheist indulge in, their receipts for equanimity are expedientswhich seem almost crude in their simplicity.Please observe, however, that I am not yet pretending finally to judge any of these attitudes. I am only describing theirvariety.The securest way to the rapturous sorts of happiness of which the twice-born make report has as an historic matter offact been through a more radical pessimism than anything that we have yet considered. We have seen how the lustreand1For instance, on the very day on which I write this page, the post brings me some aphorisms from a worldly-wise old friend inHeidelberg which may serve as a good contemporaneous expression of Epicureanism: \"By the word 'happiness' every human beingunderstands something different. It is a phantom pursued only by weaker minds. The wise man is satisfied with the more modest butmuch more definite term contentment. What education should chiefly aim at is to save us from a discontented life. Health is one favoringcondition, but by no means an indispensable one, of contentment. Woman's heart and love are a shrewd device of Nature, a trap whichshe sets for the average man, to force him into working. But the wise man will always prefer work chosen by himself.\""},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP136 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 26]Page 136enchantment may be rubbed off from the goods of nature. But there is a pitch of unhappiness so great that the goodsof nature may be entirely forgotten, and all sentiment of their existence vanish from the mental field. For thisextremity of pessimism to be reached, something more is needed than observation of life and reflection upon death.The individual must in his own person become the prey of a pathological melancholy. As the healthy-mindedenthusiast succeeds in ignoring evil's very existence, so the subject of melancholy is forced in spite of himself toignore that of all good whatever: for him it may no longer have the least reality. Such sensitiveness and susceptibilityto mental pain is a rare occurrence where the nervous constitution is entirely normal; one seldom finds it in a healthysubject even where he is the victim of the most atrocious cruelties of outward fortune. So we note here the neuroticconstitution, of which I said so much in my first lecture, making its active entrance on our scene, and destined to playa part in much that follows. Since these experiences of melancholy are in the first instance absolutely private andindividual, I can now help myself out with personal documents. Painful indeed they will be to listen to, and there isalmost an indecency in handling them in public. Yet they lie right in the middle of our path; and if we are to touch thepsychology of religion at all seriously, we must be willing to forget conventionalities, and dive below the smooth andlying official conversational surface.One can distinguish many kinds of pathological depression. Sometimes it is mere passive joylessness and dreariness,discouragement, dejection, lack of taste and zest and spring. Professor Ribot has proposed the name anhedonia todesignate this condition.\"The state of anhedonia, if I may coin a new word to pair off with analgesia,\" he writes, \"has been very little studied, but it exists. Ayoung girl was smitten with a liver disease which for some time altered her constitution. She felt no longer any affection for her fatherand mother. She would have played with her doll, but it was impossible to find the least pleasure in the act. The same things whichformerly convulsed her with laughter entirely failed to"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP137 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 27]Page 137interest her now. Esquirol observed the case of a very intelligent magistrate who was also a prey to hepatic disease. Every emotionappeared dead within him. He manifested neither perversion nor violence, but complete absence of emotional reaction. If he went to thetheatre, which he did out of habit, he could find no pleasure there. The thought of his house, of his home, of his wife, and of his absentchildren moved him as little, he said, as a theorem of Euclid.\"1Prolonged seasickness will in most persons produce a temporary condition of anhedonia. Every good, terrestrial orcelestial, is imagined only to be turned from with disgust. A temporary condition of this sort, connected with thereligious evolution of a singularly lofty character, both intellectual and moral, is well described by the Catholicphilosopher, Father Gratry, in his autobiographical recollections. In consequence of mental isolation and excessivestudy at the Polytechnic school, young Gratry fell into a state of nervous exhaustion with symptoms which he thusdescribes:—\"I had such a universal terror that I woke at night with a start, thinking that the Pantheon was tumbling on the Polytechnic school, or thatthe school was in flames, or that the Seine was pouring into the Catacombs, and that Paris was being swallowed up. And when theseimpressions were past, all day long without respite I suffered an incurable and intolerable desolation, verging on despair. I thoughtmyself, in fact, rejected by God, lost, damned! I felt something like the suffering of hell. Before that I had never even thought of hell. Mymind had never turned in that direction. Neither discourses nor reflections had impressed me in that way. I took no account of hell. Now,and all at once, I suffered in a measure what is suffered there.\"But what was perhaps still more dreadful is that every idea of heaven was taken away from me: I could no longer conceive of anythingof the sort. Heaven did not seem to me worth going to. It was like a vacuum; a mythological elysium, an abode of shadows less real thanthe earth.

Happiness, joy, light, affection, love—all these words were now devoid of sense.Without doubt I could still have talked of all these things, but I had become incapable of feeling anything in them, of understandinganything about them, of hoping anything from them, or of believing them to exist. There was my great and inconsolable grief! I neitherperceived nor conceived any longer the existence of happiness or perfection. An abstract heaven over a naked rock. Such was my presentabode for eternity.\"1So much for melancholy in the sense of incapacity for joyous feeling. A much worse form of it is positive and activeanguish, a sort of psychical neuralgia wholly unknown to healthy life. Such anguish may partake of variouscharacters, having sometimes more the quality of loathing; sometimes that of irritation and exasperation; or again ofself-mistrust and self-despair; or of suspicion, anxiety, trepidation, fear. The patient may rebel or submit; may accusehimself, or accuse outside powers; and he may or he may not be tormented by the theoretical mystery of why heshould so have to suffer. Most cases are mixed cases, and we should not treat our classifications with too muchrespect. Moreover, it is only a relatively small proportion of cases that connect themselves with the religious sphere ofexperience at all. Exasperated cases, for1A. GRATRY: Souvenirs de ma jeunesse, 1880, pp. 119 121, abridged. Some persons are affected with anhedonia permanently, or at anyrate with a loss of the usual appetite for life. The annals of suicide supply such examples as the following:—An uneducated domestic servant, aged nineteen, poisons herself, and leaves two letters expressing her motive for the act. To her parents shewrites:—\"Life is sweet perhaps to some, but I prefer what is sweeter than life, and that is death. So good-by forever, my dear parents. It is nobody'sfault, but a strong desire of my own which I have longed to fulfill for three or four years. I have always had a hope that some day I mighthave an opportunity of fulfilling it, and now it has come. It is a wonder I have put this off so long, but I thought perhaps I should cheer up abit and put all thought out of my head.\" To her brother she writes: \"Good-by forever, my own dearest brother. By the time you get this I shallbe gone forever. I know, dear love, there is no forgiveness for what I am going to do. I am tired of living, so am willing to die.

I quote now literally from the first case of melancholy on which I lay my hand. It is a letterfrom a patient in a French asylum.\"I suffer too much in this hospital, both physically and morally. Besides the burnings and the sleeplessness (for I no longer sleep since Iam shut up here, and the little rest I get is broken by bad dreams, and I am waked with a jump by nightmares, dreadful visions, lightning,thunder, and the rest), fear, atrocious fear, presses me down, holds me without respite, never lets me go. Where is the justice in it all!What have I done to deserve this excess of severity? Under what form will this fear crush me? What would I not owe to any one whowould rid me of my life! Eat, drink, lie awake all night, suffer without interruption—such is the fine legacy I have received from mymother! What I fail to understand is this abuse of power. There are limits to everything, there is a middle way. But God knows neithermiddle way nor limits. I say God, but why? All I have known so far has been the devil. After all, I am afraid of God as much as of thedevil, so I drift along, thinking of nothing but suicide, but with neither courage nor means here to execute the act. As you read this, itwill easily prove to you my insanity. The style and the ideas are incoherent enough—I can see that myself. But I cannot keep myselffrom being either crazy or an idiot; and, as things are, from whom should I ask pity? I am defenseless against the invisible enemy who istightening his coils around me. I should be no better armed against him even if I saw him, or had seen him. Oh, if he would but kill me,devil take him! Death, death, once for all! But I stop. I have raved to you long enough. I say raved, for I can write no otherwise, havingneither brain nor thoughts left. O God! what a misfortune to be born! Born like a mushroom, doubtless between an evening and amorning; and how true and right I was when in our philosophy-year in college I chewed the cud of bitterness with the pessimists. Yes,indeed, there is more pain in life than gladness—it is one long agony until the grave.

First, you see how the entire consciousness of the poor man is so choked with the feelingof evil that the sense of there being any good in the world is lost for him altogether. His attention excludes it, cannotadmit it: the sun has left his heaven. And secondly you see how the querulous temper of his misery keeps his mindfrom taking a religious direction. Querulousness of mind tends in fact rather towards irreligion; and it has played, sofar as I know, no part whatever in the construction of religious systems.Religious melancholy must be cast in a more melting mood. Tolstoy has left us, in his book called My Confession, awonderful account of the attack of melancholy which led him to his own religious conclusions. The latter in somerespects are peculiar; but the melancholy presents two characters which make it a typical document for our presentpurpose. First it is a well-marked case of anhedonia, of passive loss of appetite for all life's values; and second, itshows how the altered and estranged aspect which the world assumed in consequence of this stimulated Tolstoy'sintellect to a gnawing, carking questioning and effort for philosophic relief. I mean to quote Tolstoy at some length;but before doing so, I will make a general remark on each of these two points.First on our spiritual judgments and the sense of value in general.It is notorious that facts are compatible with opposite emotional comments, since the same fact will inspire entirelydifferent feelings in different persons, and at different times in the same person; and there is no rationally deducibleconnection between any outer fact and the sentiments it may happen to provoke. These have their source in anothersphere of existence altogether, in the animal and spiritual region of the subject's being. Conceive yourself, if possible,suddenly stripped of all the emotion with which your world now inspires you, and try to imagine it as it exists, purelyby itself, without your favorable or unfavorable, hopeful or apprehen-1ROUBINOVITCH ET TOULOUSE: La Mélancolie, 1897, p. 170, abridged."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP141 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 38]Page 141sive comment. It will be almost impossible for you to realize such a condition of negativity and deadness. No oneportion of the universe would then have importance beyond another; and the whole collection of its things and seriesof its events would be without significance, character, expression, or perspective. Whatever of value, interest, ormeaning our respective worlds may appear endued with are thus pure gifts of the spectator's mind. The passion of loveis the most familiar and extreme example of this fact. If it comes, it comes; if it does not come, no process ofreasoning can force it. Yet it transforms the value of the creature loved as utterly as the sunrise transforms Mont Blancfrom a corpse-like gray to a rosy enchantment; and it sets the whole world to a new tune for the lover and gives a newissue to his life. So with fear, with indignation, jealousy, ambition, worship. If they are there, life changes. Andwhether they shall be there or not depends almost always upon non-logical, often on organic conditions. And as theexcited interest which these passions put into the world is our gift to the world, just so are the passions themselvesgifts,—gifts to us, from sources sometimes low and sometimes high; but almost always non-logical and beyond ourcontrol. How can the moribund old man reason back to himself the romance, the mystery, the imminence of greatthings with which our old earth tingled for him in the days when he was young and well? Gifts, either of the flesh orof the spirit; and the spirit bloweth where it listeth; and the world's materials lend their surface passively to all thegifts alike, as the stage-setting receives indifferently whatever alternating colored lights may be shed upon it from theoptical apparatus in the gallery.Meanwhile the practically real world for each one of us, the effective world of the individual, is the compound world,the physical facts and emotional values in indistinguishable combination. Withdraw or pervert either factor of thiscomplex resultant, and the kind of experience we call pathological ensues.In Tolstoy's case the sense that life had any meaning whatever was for a time wholly withdrawn. The result was atransformation in the whole expression of reality. When we come to study the phenomenon of conversion or religiousregen-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP142 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 39]Page 142eration, we shall see that a not infrequent consequence of the change operated in the subject is a transfiguration of theface of nature in his eyes. A new heaven seems to shine upon a new earth. In melancholiacs there is usually a similarchange, only it is in the reverse direction. The world now looks remote, strange, sinister, uncanny. Its color is gone, itsbreath is cold, there is no speculation in the eyes it glares with. \"It is as if I lived in another century,\" says one asylumpatient.—\"I see everything through a cloud,\" says another, \"things are not as they were, and I am changed.\"—''I see,\" says athird,\"I touch, but the things do not come near me, a thick veil alters the hue and look of everything.\"—\"Persons move likeshadows, and sounds seem to come from a distant world.\"—\"There is no longer any past for me; people appear so strange; it is as if I could not see any reality, as if I were in atheatre; as if people were actors, and everything were scenery; I can no longer find myself; I walk, but why?Everything floats before my eyes, but leaves no impression.\"—\"I weep false tears, I have unreal hands: the things Isee are not real things.\"—Such are expressions that naturally rise to the lips of melancholy subjects describing theirchanged state.1Now there are some subjects whom all this leaves a prey to the profoundest astonishment. The strangeness is wrong.The unreality cannot be. A mystery is concealed, and a metaphysical solution must exist. If the natural world is sodouble-faced and unhomelike, what world, what thing is real? An urgent wondering and questioning is set up, aporing theoretic activity, and in the desperate effort to get into right relations with the matter, the sufferer is often ledto what becomes for him a satisfying religious solution.At about the age of fifty, Tolstoy relates that he began to have moments of perplexity, of what he calls arrest, as if heknew not 'how to live,' or what to do. It is obvious that these were moments in which the excitement and interestwhich our functions naturally bring had ceased. Life had been enchanting, it was now flat sober, more than sober,dead. Things were meaningless whose meaning had always been self-evident. The questions 'Why?' and 'What next?'began to1I cull these examples from the work of G. DUMAS: La Tristesse et la Joie, 1900."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP143 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 52]Page 143beset him more and more frequently. At first it seemed as if such questions must be answerable, and as if he couldeasily find the answers if he would take the time; but as they ever became more urgent, he perceived that it was likethose first discomforts of a sick man, to which he pays but little attention till they run into one continuous suffering,and then he realizes that what he took for a passing disorder means the most meomentous thing in the world for him,means his death.These questions 'Why?' 'Wherefore?' 'What for?' found no response.\"I felt,\" says Tolstoy, \"that something had broken within me on which my life had always rested, that I had nothing left to hold on to, andthat morally my life had stopped. An invincible force impelled me to get rid of my existence, in one way or another. It cannot be saidexactly that I wished to kill myself, for the force which drew me away from life was fuller, more powerful, more general than any meredesire. It was a force like my old aspiration to live, only it impelled me in the opposite direction. It was an aspiration of my whole beingto get out of life.\"Behold me then, a man happy and in good health, hiding the rope in order not to hang myself to the rafters of the room where everynight I went to sleep alone; behold me no longer going shooting, lest I should yield to the too easy temptation of putting an end to myselfwith my gun.\"I did not know what I wanted. I was afraid of life; I was driven to leave it; and in spite of that I still hoped something from it.\"All this took place at a time when so far as all my outer circumstances went, I ought to have been completely happy. I had a good wifewho loved me and whom I loved; good children and a large property which was increasing with no pains taken on my part. I was morerespected by my kinsfolk and acquaintance than I had ever been; I was loaded with praise by strangers; and without exaggeration I couldbelieve my name already famous. Moreover I was neither insane nor ill. On the contrary, I possessed a physical and mental strengthwhich I have rarely met in persons"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP144 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 53]Page 144of my age. I could mow as well as the peasants, I could work with my brain eight hours uninterruptedly and feel no bad effects.\"And yet I could give no reasonable meaning to any actions of my life. And I was surprised that I had not understood this from the verybeginning. My state of mind was as if some wicked and stupid jest was being played upon me by some one. One can live only so long asone is intoxicated, drunk with life; but when one grows sober one cannot fail to see that it is all a stupid cheat. What is truest about it isthat there is nothing even funny or silly in it; it is cruel and stupid, purely and simply.\"The oriental fable of the traveler surprised in the desert by a wild beast is very old.\"Seeking to save himself from the fierce animal, the traveler jumps into a well with no water in it; but at the bottom of this well he sees adragon waiting with open mouth to devour him. And the unhappy man, not daring to go out lest he should be the prey of the beast, notdaring to jump to the bottom lest he should be devoured by the dragon, clings to the branches of a wild bush which grows out of one ofthe cracks of the well. His hands weaken, and he feels that he must soon give way to certain fate; but still he clings, and sees two mice,one white, the other black, evenly moving round the bush to which he hangs, and gnawing off its roots.\"The traveler sees this and knows that he must inevitably perish; but while thus hanging he looks about him and finds on the leaves of thebush some drops of honey. These he reaches with his tongue and licks them off with rapture.\"Thus I hang upon the boughs of life, knowing that the inevitable dragon of death is waiting ready to tear me, and I cannot comprehendwhy I am thus made a martyr. I try to suck the honey which formerly consoled me; but the honey pleases me no longer, and day and nightthe white mouse and the black mouse gnaw the branch to which I cling. I can see but one thing: the inevitable dragon and the mice—Icannot turn my gaze away from them.\"This is no fable, but the literal incontestable truth which every one may understand. What will be the outcome of"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP145 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 55]Page 145what I do to-day? Of what I shall do to-morrow? What will be the outcome of all my life? Why should I live? Why should I doanything? Is there in life any purpose which the inevitable death which awaits me does not undo and destroy?\"These questions are the simplest in the world. From the stupid child to the wisest old man, they are in the soul of every human being.Without an answer to them, it is impossible, as I experienced, for life to go on.\"'But perhaps,' I often said to myself, 'there may be something I have failed to notice or to comprehend. It is not possible that thiscondition of despair should be natural to mankind.' And I sought for an explanation in all the branches of knowledge acquired by men. Iquestioned painfully and protractedly and with no idle curiosity. I sought, not with indolence, but laboriously and obstinately for days andnights together. I sought like a man who is lost and seeks to save himself,—and I found nothing. I became convinced, moreover, that allthose who before me had sought for an answer in the sciences have also found nothing. And not only this, but that they have recognizedthat the very thing which was leading me to despair—the meaningless absurdity of life—is the only incontestable knowledge accessibleto man.\"To prove this point, Tolstoy quotes the Buddha, Solomon, and Schopenhauer. And he finds only four ways in whichmen of his own class and society are accustomed to meet the situation. Either mere animal blindness, sucking thehoney without seeing the dragon or the mice,—\"and from such a way,\" he says, \"I can learn nothing, after what I nowknow;\" or reflective epicureanism, snatching what it can while the day lasts,—which is only a more deliberate sort ofstupefaction than the first; or manly suicide; or seeing the mice and dragon and yet weakly and plaintively clinging tothe bush of life.Suicide was naturally the consistent course dictated by the logical intellect.\"Yet,\" says Tolstoy, \"whilst my intellect was working, something else in me was working too, and kept me from"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP146 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 56]Page 146the deed—a consciousness of life, as I may call it, which was like a force that obliged my mind to fix itself in another direction and drawme out of my situation of despair. During the whole course of this year, when I almost unceasingly kept asking myself how to end thebusiness, whether by the rope or by the bullet, during all that time, alongside of all those movements of my ideas and observations, myheart kept languishing with another pining emotion. I can call this by no other name than that of a thirst for God. This craving for Godhad nothing to do with the movement of my ideas,—in fact, it was the direct contrary of that movement,—but it came from my heart. Itwas like a feeling of dread that made me seem like an orphan and isolated in the midst of all these things that were so foreign. And thisfeeling of dread was mitigated by the hope of finding the assistance of some one.\"1Of the process, intellectual as well as emotional, which, starting from this idea of God, led to Tolstoy's recovery, I willsay nothing in this lecture, reserving it for a later hour. The only thing that need interest us now is the phenomenon ofhis absolute disenchantment with ordinary life, and the fact that the whole range of habitual values may, to a man aspowerful and full of faculty as he was, come to appear so ghastly a mockery.When disillusionment has gone as far as this, there is seldom a restitutio ad integrum. One has tasted of the fruit ofthe tree, and the happiness of Eden never comes again. The happiness that comes, when any does come,—and oftenenough it fails to return in an acute form, though its form is sometimes very acute,—is not the simple ignorance of ill,but something vastly more complex, including natural evil as one of its elements, but finding natural evil no suchstumbling-block and terror because it now sees it swallowed up in supernatural good. The process is one ofredemption, not of mere reversion to natural health, and the sufferer, when saved, is saved by what seems to him asecond birth, a deeper kind of conscious being than he could enjoy before.1My extracts are from the French translation by 'ZORIA.'

He was a typical case of thepsychopathic temperament, sensitive of conscience to a diseased degree, beset by doubts, fears, and insistent ideas,and a victim of verbal automatisms, both motor and sensory. These were usually texts of Scripture which, sometimesdamnatory and sometimes favorable, would come in a half-hallucinatory form as if they were voices, and fasten onhis mind and buffet it between them like a shuttlecock. Added to this were a fearful melancholy self-contempt anddespair.\"Nay, thought I, now I grow worse and worse; now I am farther from conversion than ever I was before. If now I should have burned atthe stake, I could not believe that Christ had love for me; alas, I could neither hear him, nor see him, nor feel him, nor savor any of histhings. Sometimes I would tell my condition to the people of God, which, when they heard, they would pity me, and would tell of thePromises. But they had as good have told me that I must reach the Sun with my finger as have bidden me receive or rely upon thePromise. [Yet] all this while as to the act of sinning, I never was more tender than now; I durst not take a pin or stick, though but so bigas a straw, for my conscience now was sore, and would smart at every touch; I could not tell how to speak my words, for fear I shouldmisplace them. Oh, how gingerly did I then go, in all I did or said! I found myself as on a miry bog that shook if I did but stir; and wasas there left both by God and Christ, and the spirit, and all good things.\"But my original and inward pollution, that was my plague and my affliction. By reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own eyesthan was a toad; and I thought I was so in God's eyes too. Sin and corruption, I said, would as naturally bubble out of my heart as waterwould bubble out of a fountain. I could have changed heart with anybody. I thought none but the Devil himself could equal"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP148 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 58]Page 148me for inward wickedness and pollution of mind. Sure, thought I, I am forsaken of God; and thus I continued a long while, even for someyears together.\"And now I was sorry that God had made me a man. The beasts, birds, fishes, etc., I blessed their condition, for they had not a sinfulnature; they were not obnoxious to the wrath of God; they were not to go to hell-fire after death. I could therefore have rejoiced, had mycondition been as any of theirs. Now I blessed the condition of the dog and toad, yea, gladly would I have been in the condition of thedog or horse, for I knew they had no soul to perish under the everlasting weight of Hell or Sin, as mine was like to do. Nay, and though Isaw this, felt this, and was broken to pieces with it, yet that which added to my sorrow was, that I could not find with all my soul that Idid desire deliverance. My heart was at times exceedingly hard. If I would have given a thousand pounds for a tear, I could not shed one;no, nor sometimes scarce desire to shed one.\"I was both a burthen and a terror to myself; nor did I ever so know, as now, what it was to be weary of my life, and yet afraid to die.How gladly would I have been anything but myself! Anything but a man! and in any condition but my own.\"1Poor patient Bunyan, like Tolstoy, saw the light again, but we must also postpone that part of his story to another hour.In a later lecture I will also give the end of the experience of Henry Alline, a devoted evangelist who worked in NovaScotia a hundred years ago, and who thus vividly describes the high-water mark of the religious melancholy whichformed its beginning. The type was not unlike Bunyan's.\"Everything I saw seemed to be a burden to me; the earth seemed accursed for my sake: all trees, plants, rocks, hills, and vales seemed tobe dressed in mourning and groaning, under the weight of the curse, and everything around me seemed to be conspiring my ruin. My sinsseemed to be laid open; so that I thought that every one I1Grace abounding to the Chief of Sinners: I have printed a number of detached passages continuously."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP149 hl[27 02 2011 00 32 59]Page 149saw knew them, and sometimes I was almost ready to acknowledge many things, which I thought they knew: yea sometimes it seemed tome as if every one was pointing me out as the most guilty wretch upon earth. I had now so great a sense of the vanity and emptiness of allthings here below, that I knew the whole world could not possibly make me happy, no, nor the whole system of creation. When I wakedin the morning, the first thought would be, Oh, my wretched soul, what shall I do, where shall I go? And when I laid down, would say, Ishall be perhaps in hell before morning. I would many times look on the beasts with envy, wishing with all my heart I was in their place,that I might have no soul to lose; and when I have seen birds flying over my head, have often thought within myself, Oh, that I could flyaway from my danger and distress! Oh, how happy should I be, if I were in their place!\"1Envy of the placid beasts seems to be a very widespread affection in this type of sadness.The worst kind of melancholy is that which takes the form of panic fear. Here is an excellent example, for permissionto print which I have to thank the sufferer. The original is in French, and though the subject was evidently in a badnervous condition at the time of which he writes, his case has otherwise the merit of extreme simplicity. I translatefreely.\"Whilst in this state of philosophic pessimism and general depression of spirits about my prospects, I went one evening into a dressing-room in the twilight to procure some article that was there; when suddenly there fell upon me without any warning, just as if it came outof the darkness, a horrible fear of my own existence. Simultaneously there arose in my mind the image of an epileptic patient whom I hadseen in the asylum, a black-haired youth with greenish skin, entirely idiotic, who used to sit all day on one of the benches, or rathershelves against the wall, with his knees drawn up against his chin, and1The Life and Journal of the Rev.

He sat there like a sort of sculpturedEgyptian cat or Peruvian mummy, moving nothing but his black eyes and looking absolutely non-human. This image and my fearentered into a species of combination with each other. That shape am I, I felt, potentially. Nothing that I possess can defend me againstthat fate, if the hour for it should strike for me as it struck for him. There was such a horror of him, and such a perception of my ownmerely momentary discrepancy from him, that it was as if something hitherto solid within my breast gave way entirely, and I became amass of quivering fear. After this the universe was changed for me altogether. I awoke morning after morning with a horrible dread at thepit of my stomach, and with a sense of the insecurity of life that I never knew before, and that I have never felt since.1 It was like arevelation; and although the immediate feelings passed away, the experience has made me sympathetic with the morbid feelings of othersever since. It gradually faded, but for months I was unable to go out into the dark alone.\"In general I dreaded to be left alone. I remember wondering how other people could live, how I myself had ever lived, so unconsciousof that pit of insecurity beneath the surface of life. My mother in particular, a very cheerful person, seemed to me a perfect paradox in herunconsciousness of danger, which you may well believe I was very careful not to disturb by revelations of my own state of mind. I havealways thought that this experience of melancholia of mine had a religious bearing.\"On asking this correspondent to explain more fully what he meant by these last words, the answer he wrote was this:—1Compare Bunyan: \"There was I struck into a very great trembling, insomuch that at some times I could, for days together, feel my verybody, as well as my mind, to shake and totter under the sense of the dreadful judgment of God, that should fall on those that have sinnedthat most fearful and unpardonable sin. I felt also such clogging and heat at my stomach, by reason of this my terror, that I was,especially at some times, as if my breast-bone would have split asunder. Thus did I wind, and twine, and shrink, under the burden thatwas upon me; which burden also did so oppress me that I could neither stand, nor go, nor lie, either at rest or quiet.\""},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP151 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 02]Page 151\"I mean that the fear was so invasive and powerful that if I had not clung to scripture-texts like 'The eternal God is my refuge,' etc.,'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden,' etc., 'I am the resurrection and the life,' etc., I think I should have grown reallyinsane.\"1There is no need of more examples. The cases we have looked at are enough. One of them gives us the vanity ofmortal things; another the sense of sin; and the remaining one describes the fear of the universe;—and in one or otherof these three ways it always is that man's original optimism and self-satisfaction get leveled with the dust.In none of these cases was there any intellectual insanity or delusion about matters of fact; but were we disposed toopen the chapter of really insane melancholia, with its hallucinations and delusions, it would be a worse story still—desperation absolute and complete, the whole universe coagulating about the sufferer into a material of overwhelminghorror, surrounding him without opening or end. Not the conception or intellectual perception of evil, but the grislyblood-freezing heart-palsying sensation of it close upon one, and no other conception or sensation able to live for amoment in its presence. How irrelevantly remote seem all our usual refined optimisms and intellectual and moralconsolations in presence of a need of help like this! Here is the real core of the religious problem: Help! help! Noprophet can claim to bring a final message unless he says things that will have a sound of reality in the ears of victimssuch as these. But the deliverance must come in as strong a form as the complaint, if it is to take effect; and thatseems a reason why the coarser religions, revivalistic, orgiastic, with blood and miracles and super-natural operations,may possibly never be displaced. Some constitutions need them too much.Arrived at this point, we can see how great an antagonism may naturally arise between the healthy-minded way ofviewing life and the way that takes all this experience of evil as something essential. To this latter way, the morbid-minded1For another case of fear equally sudden, see HENRY JAMES: Society the Redeemed Form of Man, Boston, 1879, pp. 43 ff."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP152 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 03]Page 152way, as we might call it, healthy-mindedness pure and simple seems unspeakably blind and shallow. To the healthy-minded way, on the other hand, the way of the sick soul seems unmanly and diseased. With their grubbing in rat-holesinstead of living in the light; with their manufacture of fears, and preoccupation with every unwholesome kind ofmisery, there is something almost obsene about these children of wrath and cravers of a second birth. If religiousintolerance and hanging and burning could again become the order of the day, there is little doubt that, however itmay have been in the past, the healthy-minded would at present show themselves the less indulgent party of the two.In our own attitude, not yet abandoned, of impartial on-lookers, what are we to say of this quarrel? It seems to methat we are bound to say that morbid-mindedness ranges over the wider scale of experience, and that its survey is theone that overlaps. The method of averting one's attention from evil, and living simply in the light of good is splendidas long as it will work. It will work with many persons; it will work far more generally than most of us are ready tosuppose; and within the sphere of its successful operation there is nothing to be said against it as a religious solution.But it breaks down impotently as soon as melancholy comes; and even though one be quite free from melancholyone's self, there is no doubt that healthy-mindedness is inadequate as a philosophical doctrine, because the evil factswhich it refuses positively to account for are a genuine portion of reality; and they may after all be the best key tolife's significance, and possibly the only openers of our eyes to the deepest levels of truth.The normal process of life contains moments as bad as any of those which insane melancholy is filled with, momentsin which radical evil gets its innings and takes its solid turn. The lunatic's visions of horror are all drawn from thematerial of daily fact. Our civilization is founded on the shambles, and every individual existence goes out in a lonelyspasm of helpless agony. If you protest, my friend, wait till you arrive there yourself! To believe in the carnivorousreptiles of geologic times is hard for our imagination—they seem too much like mere museum specimens. Yet there isno tooth in any one of"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP153 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 04]Page 153those museum-skulls that did not daily through long years of the foretime hold fast to the body struggling in despairof some fated living victim. Forms of horror just as dreadful to their victims, if on a smaller spatial scale, fill theworld about us to-day. Here on our very hearths and in our gardens the infernal cat plays with the panting mouse, orholds the hot bird fluttering in her jaws. Crocodiles and rattlesnakes and pythons are at this moment vessels of life asreal as we are; their loathsome existence fills every minute of every day that drags its length along; and whenever theyor other wild beasts clutch their living prey, the deadly horror which an agitated melancholiac feels is the literallyright reaction on the situation.1It may indeed be that no religious reconciliation with the absolute totality of things is possible. Some evils, indeed, areministerial to higher forms of good; but it may be that there are forms of evil so extreme as to enter into no goodsystem whatsoever, and that, in respect of such evil, dumb submission or neglect to notice is the only practicalresource. This question must confront us on a later day. But provisionally, and as a mere matter of program andmethod, since the evil facts are as genuine parts of nature as the good ones, the philosophic presumption should be thatthey have some1Example: ''It was about eleven o'clock at night but I strolled on still with the people . Suddenly upon the left side of our road, acrackling was heard among the bushes; all of us were alarmed, and in an instant a tiger, rushing out of the jungle, pounced upon the oneof the party that was foremost, and carried him off in the twinkling of an eye. The rush of the animal, and the crush of the poor victim'sbones in his mouth, and his last cry of distress, 'Ho hai!' involuntarily reëchoed by all of us, was over in three seconds; and then I knownot what happened till I returned to my senses, when I found myself and companions lying down on the ground as if prepared to bedevoured by our enemy, the sovereign of the forest. I find my pen incapable of describing the terror of that dreadful moment. Our limbsstiffened, our power of speech ceased, and our hearts beat violently, and only a whisper of the same 'Ho hai!' was heard from us. In thisstate we crept on all fours for some distance back, and then ran for life with the speed of an Arab horse for about half an hour, andfortunately happened to come to a small village . After this every one of us was attacked with fever, attended with shivering, in whichdeplorable state we remained till morning.\"—Autobiography of Lutfullah, a Mohammedan Gentleman, Leipzig, 1857, p. 112."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP154 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 06]Page 154rational significance, and that systematic healthy-mindedness, failing as it does to accord to sorrow, pain, and deathany positive and active attention whatever, is formally less complete than systems that try at least to include theseelements in their scope.The completest religions would therefore seem to be those in which the pessimistic elements are best developed.Buddhism, of course, and Christianity are the best known to us of these. They are essentially religions of deliverance:the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into the real life. In my next lecture, I will try to discusssome of the psychological conditions of this second birth.

At theclose of it we were brought into full view of the contrast between the two ways of looking at life which arecharacteristic respectively of what we called the healthy-minded, who need to be born only once, and of the sicksouls, who must be twice-born in order to be happy. The result is two different conceptions of the universe of ourexperience. In the religion of the once-born the world is a sort of rectilinear or one-storied affair, whose accounts arekept in one denomination, whose parts have just the values which naturally they appear to have, and of which asimple algebraic sum of pluses and minuses will give the total worth. Happiness and religious peace consist in livingon the plus side of the account. In the religion of the twice-born, on the other hand, the world is a double-storiedmystery. Peace cannot be reached by the simple addition of pluses and elimination of minuses from life. Natural goodis not simply insufficient in amount and transient, there lurks a falsity in its very being. Cancelled as it all is by deathif not by earlier enemies, it gives no final balance, and can never be the thing intended for our lasting worship. Itkeeps us from our real good, rather; and renunciation and despair of it are our first step in the direction of the truth.There are two lives, the natural and the spiritual, and we must lose the one before we can participate in the other.In their extreme forms, of pure naturalism and pure salvationism, the two types are violently contrasted; though hereas in most other current classifications, the radical extremes are somewhat ideal abstractions, and the concrete humanbeings whom we oftenest meet are intermediate varieties and mixtures. Practically, however, you all recognize thedifference: you understand, for example, the disdain of the methodist convert for the mere sky-blue healthy-mindedmoralist; and you likewise enter into the aversion of the latter to what"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP156 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 14]Page 156seems to him the diseased subjectivism of the Methodist, dying to live, as he calls it, and making of paradox and theinversion of natural appearances the essence of God's truth.1The psychological basis of the twice-born character seems to be a certain discordancy or heterogeneity in the nativetemperament of the subject, an incompletely unified moral and intellectual constitution.\"Homo duplex, homo duplex!\" writes Alphonse Daudet.\"The first time that I perceived that I was two was at the death of my brother Henri, when my father cried out so dramatically, 'He isdead, he is dead!' While my first self wept, my second self thought, 'How truly given was that cry, how fine it would be at the theatre.' Iwas then fourteen years old.\"This horrible duality has often given me matter for reflection. Oh, this terrible second me, always seated whilst the other is on foot,acting, living, suffering, bestirring itself. This second me that I have never been able to intoxicate, to make shed tears, or put to sleep.And how it sees into things, and how it mocks!\"2Recent works on the psychology of character have had much to say upon this point.3 Some persons are born with aninner constitution which is harmonious and well balanced from the outset. Their impulses are consistent with oneanother, their will follows without trouble the guidance of their intellect, their passions are not excessive, and theirlives are little haunted by regrets. Others are oppositely constituted; and are so in degrees which may vary fromsomething so slight as to result in a merely odd or whimsical inconsistency, to a discordancy of which theconsequences may be inconvenient1E. g., \"Our young people are diseased with the theological problems of original sin, origin of evil, predestination, and the like.

Of the more innocent kinds of heterogeneity I find a good example in Mrs. Annie Besant'sautobiography.\"I have ever been the queerest mixture of weakness and strength, and have paid heavily for the weakness. As a child I used to suffertortures of shyness, and if my shoe-lace was untied would feel shamefacedly that every eye was fixed on the unlucky string; as a girl Iwould shrink away from strangers and think myself unwanted and unliked, so that I was full of eager gratitude to any one who noticedme kindly; as the young mistress of a house I was afraid of my servants, and would let careless work pass rather than bear the pain ofreproving the ill-doer; when I have been lecturing and debating with no lack of spirit on the platform, I have preferred to go without whatI wanted at the hotel rather than to ring and make the waiter fetch it. Combative on the platform in defense of any cause I cared for, Ishrink from quarrel or disapproval in the house, and am a coward at heart in private while a good fighter in public. How often have Ipassed unhappy quarters of an hour screwing up my courage to find fault with some subordinate whom my duty compelled me toreprove, and how often have I jeered at myself for a fraud as the doughty platform combatant, when shrinking from blaming some lad orlass for doing their work badly. An unkind look or word has availed to make me shrink into myself as a snail into its shell, while, on theplatform, opposition makes me speak my best.\"1This amount of inconsistency will only count as amiable weakness; but a stronger degree of heterogeneity may makehavoc of the subject's life. There are persons whose existence is little more than a series of zig-zags, as now onetendency and now another gets the upper hand. Their spirit wars with their flesh, they wish for incompatibles,wayward impulses interrupt their most deliberate plans, and their lives are one long drama of repentance and of effortto repair misdemeanors and mistakes.Heterogeneous personality has been explained as the result of inheritance—the traits of character of incompatible and1ANNIE BESANT: an Autobiography, p. 82."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP158 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 27]Page 158antagonistic ancestors are supposed to be preserved alongside of each other.1 This explanation may pass for what it isworth—it certainly needs corroboration. But whatever the cause of heterogeneous personality may be, we find theextreme examples of it in the psychopathic temperament, of which I spoke in my first lecture. All writers about thattemperament make the inner heterogeneity prominent in their descriptions. Frequently, indeed, it is only this trait thatleads us to ascribe that temperament to a man at all. A 'dégénéré supérieur' is simply a man of sensibility in manydirections, who finds more difficulty than is common in keeping his spiritual house in order and running his furrowstraight, because his feelings and impulses are too keen and too discrepant mutually. In the haunting and insistentideas, in the irrational impulses, the morbid scruples, dreads, and inhibitions which beset the psychopathictemperament when it is thoroughly pronounced, we have exquisite examples of heterogeneous personality. Bunyanhad an obsession of the words, \"Sell Christ for this, sell him for that, sell him, sell him!\" which would run through hismind a hundred times together, until one day out of breath with retorting, \"I will not, I will not,\" he impulsively said,\"Let him go if he will,\" and this loss of the battle kept him in despair for over a year. The lives of the saints are full ofsuch blasphemous obsessions, ascribed invariably to the direct agency of Satan. The phenomenon connects itself withthe life of the subconscious self, so-called, of which we must erelong speak more directly.Now in all of us, however constituted, but to a degree the greater in proportion as we are intense and sensitive andsubject to diversified temptations, and to the greatest possible degree if we are decidedly psychopathic, does thenormal evolution of character chiefly consist in the straightening out and unifying of the inner self. The higher and thelower feelings, the useful and the erring impulses, begin by being a comparative chaos within us—they must end byforming a stable system of functions in right subordination. Unhappiness is apt to characterize the period of order-making and struggle. If the individual be of tender conscience and religiously1SMITH BAKER, in Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases, September, 1893."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP159 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 28]Page 159quickened, the unhappiness will take the form of moral remorse and compunction, of feeling inwardly vile and wrong,and of standing in false relations to the author of one's being and appointer of one's spiritual fate. This is the religiousmelancholy and 'conviction of sin' that have played so large a part in the history of Protestant Christianity. The man'sinterior is a battle-ground for what he feels to be two deadly hostile selves, one actual, the other ideal. As VictorHugo makes his Mahomet say:—\"Fils, je suis le champ vil des sublimes combats:Tantôt l'homme d'en haut, et tantôt l'homme d'en bas;Et le mal dans ma bouche avec le bien alterne,Comme dans le désert le sable et la citerne.\"Wrong living, impotent aspirations; \"What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I,\" as Saint Paul says; self-loathing, self-despair; an unintelligible and intolerable burden to which one is mysteriously the heir.Let me quote from some typical cases of discordant personality, with melancholy in the form of self-condemnationand sense of sin. Saint Augustine's case is a classic example. You all remember his half-pagan, half-Christian bringingup at Carthage, his emigration to Rome and Milan, his adoption of Manicheism and subsequent skepticism, and hisrestless search for truth and purity of life; and finally how, distracted by the struggle between the two souls in hisbreast, and ashamed of his own weakness of will, when so many others whom he knew and knew of had thrown offthe shackles of sensuality and dedicated themselves to chastity and the higher life, he heard a voice in the garden say,\"Sume, lege\" (take and read), and opening the Bible at random, saw the text, \"not in chambering and wantonness,\"etc., which seemed directly sent to his address, and laid the inner storm to rest forever.1 Augustine's psychological1LOUIS GOURDON (Essai sur la Conversion de Saint Augustin, Paris, Fischbacher, 1900) has shown by an analysis of Augustine's writingsimmediately after the date of his conversion (A. D. 386) that the account he gives in the Confessions is premature. The crisis in the gardenmarked a definitive conversion from his former life, but it was to the neo-platonic spiritualism and only a halfway stage towardChristianity. The latter he appears not fully and radically to have embraced until four years more had passed."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP160 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 29]Page 160genius has given an account of the trouble of having a divided self which has never been surpassed.\"The new will which I began to have was not yet strong enough to overcome that other will, strengthened by long indulgence. So thesetwo wills, one old, one new, one carnal, the other spiritual, contended with each other and disturbed my soul. I understood by my ownexperience what I had read, 'flesh lusteth against spirit, and spirit against flesh.' It was myself indeed in both the wills, yet more myself inthat which I approved in myself than in that which I disapproved in myself. Yet it was through myself that habit had attained so fierce amastery over me, because I had willingly come whither I willed not. Still bound to earth, I refused, O God, to fight on thy side, as muchafraid to be freed from all bonds, as I ought to have feared being trammeled by them.\"Thus the thoughts by which I meditated upon thee were like the efforts of one who would awake, but being overpowered with sleepinessis soon asleep again. Often does a man when heavy sleepiness is on his limbs defer to shake it off, and though not approving it,encourage it; even so I was sure it was better to surrender to thy love than to yield to my own lusts, yet, though the former courseconvinced me, the latter pleased and held me bound. There was naught in me to answer thy call, 'Awake, thou sleeper,' but onlydrawling, drowsy words, 'Presently; yes, presently; wait a little while.' But the 'presently' had no 'present,' and the 'little while' grew long .For I was afraid thou wouldst hear me too soon, and heal me at once of my disease of lust, which I wished to satiate rather than to seeextinguished. With what lashes of words did I not scourge my own soul. Yet it shrank back; it refused, though it had no excuse to offer .I said within myself: 'Come, let it be done now,' and as I said it, I was on the point of the resolve. I all but did it, yet I did not do it. And Imade another effort, and almost succeeded, yet I did not reach it, and did not grasp it, hesitating to die to death, and live to life; and theevil to which I was so wonted held me more than the better life I had not tried.\"11Confessions, Book VIII., chaps. v., vii., xi., abridged."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP161 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 31]Page 161There could be no more perfect description of the divided will, when the higher wishes lack just that last acuteness,that touch of explosive intensity, of dynamogenic quality (to use the slang of the psychologists), that enables them toburst their shell, and make irruption efficaciously into life and quell the lower tendencies forever. In a later lecture weshall have much to say about this higher excitability.I find another good description of the divided will in the autobiography of Henry Alline, the Nova Scotian evangelist,of whose melancholy I read a brief account in my last lecture. The poor youth's sins were, as you will see, of the mostharmless order, yet they interfered with what proved to be his truest vocation, so they gave him great distress.\"I was now very moral in my life, but found no rest of conscience. I now began to be esteemed in young company, who knew nothing ofmy mind all this while, and their esteem began to be a snare to my soul, for I soon began to be fond of carnal mirth, though I stillflattered myself that if I did not get drunk, nor curse, nor swear, there would be no sin in frolicking and carnal mirth, and I thought Godwould indulge young people with some (what I called simple or civil) recreation. I still kept a round of duties, and would not suffermyself to run into any open vices, and so got along very well in time of health and prosperity, but when I was distressed or threatened bysickness, death, or heavy storms of thunder, my religion would not do, and I found there was something wanting, and would begin torepent my going so much to frolics, but when the distress was over, the devil and my own wicked heart, with the solicitations of myassociates, and my fondness for young company, were such strong allurements, I would again give way, and thus I got to be very wildand rude, at the same time kept up my rounds of secret prayer and reading; but God, not willing I should destroy myself, still followedme with his calls, and moved with such power upon my conscience, that I could not satisfy myself with my diversions, and in the midstof my mirth sometimes would have such a sense of my lost"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP162 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 32]Page 162and undone condition, that I would wish myself from the company, and after it was over, when I went home, would make manypromises that I would attend no more on these frolics, and would beg forgiveness for hours and hours; but when I came to have thetemptation again, I would give way: no sooner would I hear the music and drink a glass of wine, but I would find my mind elevated andsoon proceed to any sort of merriment or diversion, that I thought was not debauched or openly vicious; but when I returned from mycarnal mirth I felt as guilty as ever, and could sometimes not close my eyes for some hours after I had gone to my bed. I was one of themost unhappy creatures on earth.\"Sometimes I would leave the company (often speaking to the fiddler to cease from playing, as if I was tired), and go out and walk aboutcrying and praying, as if my very heart would break, and beseeching God that he would not cut me off, nor give me up to hardness ofheart. Oh, what unhappy hours and nights I thus wore away! When I met sometimes with merry companions, and my heart was ready tosink, I would labor to put on as cheerful a countenance as possible, that they might not distrust anything, and sometimes would beginsome discourse with young men or young women on purpose, or propose a merry song, lest the distress of my soul would be discovered,or mistrusted, when at the same time I would then rather have been in a wilderness in exile, than with them or any of their pleasures orenjoyments. Thus for many months when I was in company, I would act the hypocrite and feign a merry heart, but at the same timewould endeavor as much as I could to shun their company, oh wretched and unhappy mortal that I was! Everything I did, and wherever Iwent, I was still in a storm, and yet I continued to be the chief contriver and ringleader of the frolics for many months after; though itwas a toil and torment to attend them; but the devil and my own wicked heart drove me about like a slave, telling me that I must do thisand do that, and bear this and bear that, and turn here and turn there, to keep my credit up, and retain the esteem of my associates: and allthis while I continued"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP163 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 33]Page 163as strict as possible in my duties, and left no stone unturned to pacify my conscience, watching even against my thoughts, and prayingcontinually wherever I went: for I did not think there was any sin in my conduct, when I was among carnal company, because I did nottake any satisfaction there, but only followed it, I thought, for sufficient reasons.''But still, all that I did or could do, conscience would roar night and day.\"Saint Augustine and Alline both emerged into the smooth waters of inner unity and peace, and I shall next ask you toconsider more closely some of the peculiarities of the process of unification, when it occurs. It may come gradually, orit may occur abruptly; it may come through altered feelings, or through altered powers of action; or it may comethrough new intellectual insights, or through experiences which we shall later have to designate as 'mystical.' Howeverit come, it brings a characteristic sort of relief; and never such extreme relief as when it is cast into the religiousmould. Happiness! happiness! religion is only one of the ways in which men gain that gift. Easily, permanently, andsuccessfully, it often transforms the most intolerable misery into the profoundest and most enduring happiness.But to find religion is only one out of many ways of reaching unity; and the process of remedying innerincompleteness and reducing inner discord is a general psychological process, which may take place with any sort ofmental material, and need not necessarily assume the religious form. In judging of the religious types of regenerationwhich we are about to study, it is important to recognize that they are only one species of a genus that contains othertypes as well. For example, the new birth may be away from religion into incredulity; or it may be from moralscrupulosity into freedom and license; or it may be produced by the irruption into the individual's life of some newstimulus or passion, such as love, ambition, cupidity, revenge, or patriotic devotion. In all these instances we haveprecisely the same psychological form of event,—a firmness, stability, and equilibrium succeeding a period of stormand stress and inconsistency.

Jouffroy's doubts had long harassed him; but he dateshis final crisis from a certain night when his disbelief grew fixed and stable, and where the immediate result wassadness at the illusions he had lost.\"I shall never forget that night of December,\" writes Jouffroy, \"in which the veil that concealed from me my own incredulity was torn. Ihear again my steps in that narrow naked chamber where long after the hour of sleep had come I had the habit of walking up and down. Isee again that moon, half-veiled by clouds, which now and again illuminated the frigid window-panes. The hours of the night flowed onand I did not note their passage. Anxiously I followed my thoughts, as from layer to layer they descended towards the foundation of myconsciousness, and, scattering one by one all the illusions which until then had screened its windings from my view, made them everymoment more clearly visible.\"Vainly I clung to these last beliefs as a shipwrecked sailor clings to the fragments of his vessel; vainly, frightened at the unknown voidin which I was about to float, I turned with them towards my childhood, my family, my country, all that was dear and sacred to me: theinflexible current of my thought was too strong,—parents, family, memory, beliefs, it forced me to let go of everything. The investigationwent on more obstinate and more severe as it drew near its term, and did not stop until the end was reached. I knew then that in the depthof my mind nothing was left that stood erect.\"This moment was a frightful one; and when towards morning I threw myself exhausted on my bed, I seemed to feel my earlier life, sosmiling and so full, go out like a fire, and before me another life opened, sombre and unpeopled, where in future I must live alone, alonewith my fatal thought which had exiled me thither, and which I was"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP165 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 36]Page 165tempted to curse. The days which followed this discovery were the saddest of my life.\"1In John Foster's Essay on Decision of Character, there is an account of a case of sudden conversion to avarice, whichis illustrative enough to quote:—A young man, it appears, \"wasted, in two or three years, a large patrimony in profligate revels with a number of worthless associates whocalled themselves his friends, and who, when his last means were exhausted, treated him of course with neglect or contempt. Reduced toabsolute want, he one day went out of the house with an intention to put an end to his life; but wandering awhile almost unconsciously,he came to the brow of an eminence which overlooked what were lately his estates. Here he sat down, and remained fixed in thought anumber of hours, at the end of which he sprang from the ground with a vehement,1TH. JOUFFROY: Nouveaux Mélanges philosophiques, 2me édition, p. 83. I add two other cases of counter-conversion dating from acertain moment. The first is from Professor Starbuck's manuscript collection, and the narrator is a woman.\"Away down in the bottom of my heart, I believe I was always more or less skeptical about 'God;' skepticism grew as an undercurrent, allthrough my early youth, but it was controlled and covered by the emotional elements in my religious growth. When I was sixteen I joined thechurch and was asked if I loved God. I replied 'Yes,' as was customary and expected. But instantly with a flash something spoke within me,'No, you do not.' I was haunted for a long time with shame and remorse for my falsehood and for my wickedness in not loving God, mingledwith fear that there might be an avenging God who would punish me in some terrible way. At nineteen, I had an attack of tonsilitis. Before Ihad quite recovered, I heard told a story of a brute who had kicked his wife downstairs, and then continued the operation until she becameinsensible. I felt the horror of the thing keenly. Instantly this thought flashed through my mind: 'I have no use for a God who permits suchthings.' This experience was followed by months of stoical indifference to the God of my previous life, mingled with feelings of positivedislike and a somewhat proud defiance of him. I still thought there might be a God. If so he would probably damn me, but I should have tostand it. I felt very little fear and no desire to propitiate him. I have never had any personal relations with him since this painful experience.\"The second case exemplifies how small an additional stimulus will overthrow the mind into a new state of equilibrium when the process ofpreparation and incubation has proceeded far enough.

He had formed his resolution, which was, that all these estates should be his again; he had formed his plan, too, whichhe instantly began to execute. He walked hastily forward, determined to seize the first opportunity, of however humble a kind, to gainany money, though it were ever so despicable a trifle, and resolved absolutely not to spend, if he could help it, a farthing of whatever hemight obtain. The first thing that drew his attention was a heap of coals shot out of carts on the pavement before a house. He offeredhimself to shovel or wheel them into the place where they were to be laid, and was employed. He received a few pence for the labor; andthen, in pursuance of the saving part of his plan, requested some small gratuity of meat and drink, which was given him. He then lookedout for the next thing that might chance; and went, with indefatigable industry, through a succession of servile employments in differentplaces, of longer and shorter duration, still scrupulous in avoiding, as far as possible, the expense of a penny. He promptly seized everyopportunity which could advance his design, without re-(Footnote continued from previous page)proverbial last straw added to the camel's burden, or that touch of a needle which makes the salt in a supersaturated fluid suddenly beginto crystallize out.Tolstoy writes: \"S., a frank and intelligent man, told me as follows how he ceased to believe:—\"He was twenty-six years old when one day on a hunting expedition, the time for sleep having come, he set himself to pray according to thecustom he had held from childhood.\"His brother, who was hunting with him, lay upon the hay and looked at him. When S. had finished his prayer and was turning to sleep, thebrother said, 'Do you still keep up that thing?' Nothing more was said. But since that day, now more than thirty years ago, S. has neverprayed again; he never takes communion, and does not go to church. All this, not because he became acquainted with convictions of hisbrother which he then and there adopted; not because he made any new resolution in his soul, but merely because the words spoken by hisbrother were like the light push of a finger against a leaning wall already about to tumble by its own weight. These words but showed himthat the place wherein he supposed religion dwelt in him had long been empty, and that the sentences he uttered, the crosses and bows whichhe made during his prayer, were actions with no inner sense. Having once seized their absurdity, he could no longer keep them up.\" MaConfession, p. 8."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP167 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 38]Page 167garding the meanness of occupation or appearance. By this method he had gained, after a considerable time, money enough to purchasein order to sell again a few cattle, of which he had taken pains to understand the value. He speedily but cautiously turned his first gainsinto second advantages; retained without a single deviation his extreme parsimony; and thus advanced by degrees into larger transactionsand incipient wealth. I did not hear, or have forgotten, the continued course of his life, but the final result was, that he more thanrecovered his lost possessions, and died an inveterate miser, worth £60,000.\"1Let me turn now to the kind of case, the religious case, namely, that immediately concerns us. Here is one of thesimplest possible type, an account of the conversion to the sys-1Op. cit., Letter III., abridged.I subjoin an additional document which has come into my possession, and which represents in a vivid way what is probably a very frequentsort of conversion, if the opposite of 'falling in love,' falling out of love, may be so termed. Falling in love also conforms frequently to thistype, a latent process of unconscious preparation often preceding a sudden awakening to the fact that the mischief is irretrievably done. Thefree and easy tone in this narrative gives it a sincerity that speaks for itself.\"For two years of this time I went through a very bad experience, which almost drove me mad. I had fallen violently in love with a girl who,young as she was, had a spirit of coquetry like a cat. As I look back on her now, I hate her, and wonder how I could ever have fallen so lowas to be worked upon to such an extent by her attractions. Nevertheless, I fell into a regular fever, could think of nothing else; whenever I wasalone, I pictured her attractions, and spent most of the time when I should have been working, in recalling our previous interviews, andimagining future conversations. She was very pretty, good humored, and jolly to the last degree, and intensely pleased with my admiration.Would give me no decided answer yes or no, and the queer thing about it was that whilst pursuing her for her hand, I secretly knew all alongthat she was unfit to be a wife for me, and that she never would say yes. Although for a year we took our meals at the same boarding-house,so that I saw her continually and familiarly, our closer relations had to be largely on the sly, and this fact, together with my jealousy ofanother one of her male admirers, and my own conscience despising me for my uncontrollable weakness, made me so nervous and sleeplessthat I really thought I should become insane. I understand well those young men murdering their sweethearts, which appear so often in thepapers. Nevertheless I did love her passionately, and in some ways she did deserve it.\"The queer thing was the sudden and unexpected way in which it all stopped. I was going to my work after breakfast one morning, thinkingas(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP168 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 40]Page 168tematic religion of healthy-mindedness of a man who must already have been naturally of the healthy-minded type. Itshows how, when the fruit is ripe, a touch will make it fall.Mr. Horace Fletcher, in his little book called Menticulture, relates that a friend with whom he was talking of the self-control attained by the Japanese through their practice of the Buddhist discipline said:—\"'You must first get rid of anger and worry.' 'But,' said I, 'is that possible?' 'Yes,' replied he; 'it is possible to the Japanese, and ought to bepossible to us.'\"On my way back I could think of nothing else but the words 'get rid, get rid'; and the idea must have continued to possess me during mysleeping hours, for the first con-(Footnote continued from previous page)usual of her and of my misery, when, just as if some outside power laid hold of me, I found myself turning round and almost running tomy room, where I immediately got out all the relics of her which I possessed, including some hair, all her notes and letters, andambrotypes on glass. The former I made a fire of, the latter I actually crushed beneath my heel, in a sort of fierce joy of revenge andpunishment. I now loathed and despised her altogether, and as for myself I felt as if a load of disease had suddenly been removed fromme. That was the end. I never spoke to her or wrote to her again in all the subsequent years, and I have never had a single moment ofloving thought towards one who for so many months entirely filled my heart. In fact, I have always rather hated her memory, thoughnow I can see that I had gone unnecessarily far in that direction. At any rate, from that happy morning onward I regained possession ofmy own proper soul, and have never since fallen into any similar trap.\"This seems to me an unusually clear example of two different levels of personality, inconsistent in their dictates, yet so well balanced againsteach other as for a long time to fill the life with discord and dissatisfaction. At last, not gradually, but in a sudden crisis, the unstableequilibrium is resolved, and this happens so unexpectedly that it is as if, to use the writer's words, \"some outside power laid hold.\"Professor Starbuck gives an analogous case, and a converse case of hatred suddenly turning into love, in his Psychology of Religion, p. 141.Compare the other highly curious instances which he gives on pp. 137 144, of sudden non-religious alterations of habit or character. Heseems right in conceiving all such sudden changes as results of special cerebral functions unconsciously developing until they are ready toplay a controlling part, when they make irruption into the conscious life. When we treat of sudden 'conversion,' I shall make as much use as Ican of this hypothesis of subconscious incubation."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP169 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 41]Page 169sciousness in the morning brought back the same thought, with the revelation of a discovery, which framed itself into the reasoning, 'If itis possible to get rid of anger and worry, why is it necessary to have them at all?' I felt the strength of the argument, and at once acceptedthe reasoning. The baby had discovered that it could walk. It would scorn to creep any longer.\"From the instant I realized that these cancer spots of worry and anger were removable, they left me. With the discovery of theirweakness they were exorcised. From that time life has had an entirely different aspect.\"Although from that moment the possibility and desirability of freedom from the depressing passions has been a reality to me, it took mesome months to feel absolute security in my new position; but, as the usual occasions for worry and anger have presented themselvesover and over again, and I have been unable to feel them in the slightest degree, I no longer dread or guard against them, and I amamazed at my increased energy and vigor of mind; at my strength to meet situations of all kinds, and at my disposition to love andappreciate everything.\"I have had occasion to travel more than ten thousand miles by rail since that morning. The same Pullman porter, conductor, hotel-waiter, peddler, book-agent, cabman, and others who were formerly a source of annoyance and irritation have been met, but I am notconscious of a single incivility.

The porter from the hotel came running and panting into thestation just as the train pulled out of sight. When he saw me, he looked as if he feared a scolding, and began to tell of being blocked in acrowded street and unable to get out.

Here is your fee, I am sorry you had all this trouble in earning it.' Thelook of surprise that came over his face was so filled with pleasure that I was repaid on the spot for the delay in my departure. Next dayhe would not accept a cent for the service, and he and I are friends for life.\"During the first weeks of my experience I was on guard only against worry and anger; but, in the mean time, having noticed the absenceof the other depressing and dwarfing passions, I began to trace a relationship, until I was convinced that they are all growths from the tworoots I have specified. I have felt the freedom now for so long a time that I am sure of my relation toward it; and I could no more harborany of the thieving and depressing influences that once I nursed as a heritage of humanity than a fop would voluntarily wallow in a filthygutter.\"There is no doubt in my mind that pure Christianity and pure Buddhism, and the Mental Sciences and all Religions, fundamentally teachwhat has been a discovery to me; but none of them have presented it in the light of a simple and easy process of elimination. At one timeI wondered if the elimination would not yield to indifference and sloth. In my experience, the contrary is the result. I feel such anincreased desire to do something useful that it seems as if I were a boy again and the energy for play had returned. I could fight asreadily as (and better than) ever, if there were occasion for it. It does not make one a coward. It can't, since fear is one of the thingseliminated. I notice the absence of timidity in the presence of any audience. When a boy, I was standing under a tree which was struck bylightning, and received a shock from the effects of which I never knew exemption until I had dissolved partnership with worry. Sincethen, lightning and thunder have been encountered under conditions which would formerly have caused great depression and discomfort,without [my] experiencing a trace of either. Surprise is also greatly modified, and one is less liable to become startled by unexpectedsights or noises.\"As far as I am individually concerned, I am not bothering"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP171 hl[27 02 2011 00 33 50]Page 171myself at present as to what the results of this emancipated condition may be. I have no doubt that the perfect health aimed at byChristian Science may be one of the possibilities, for I note a marked improvement in the way my stomach does its duty in assimilatingthe food I give it to handle, and I am sure it works better to the sound of a song than under the friction of a frown. Neither am I wastingany of this precious time formulating an idea of a future existence or a future Heaven. The Heaven that I have within myself is asattractive as any that has been promised or that I can imagine; and I am willing to let the growth lead where it will, as long as the angerand their brood have no part in misguiding it.\"1The older medicine used to speak of two ways, lysis and crisis, one gradual, the other abrupt, in which one mightrecover from a bodily disease. In the spiritual realm there are also two ways, one gradual, the other sudden, in whichinner unification may occur. Tolstoy and Bunyan may again serve us as examples, examples, as it happens, of thegradual way, though it must be confessed at the outset that it is hard to follow these windings of the hearts of others,and one feels that their words do not reveal their total secret.Howe'er this be, Tolstoy, pursuing his unending questioning, seemed to come to one insight after another. First heperceived that his conviction that life was meaningless took only this finite life into account. He was looking for thevalue of one finite term in that of another, and the whole result could only be one of those indeterminate equations inmathematics which end with 0 = 0. Yet this is as far as the reasoning intellect by itself can go, unless irrationalsentiment or faith brings in the infinite. Believe in the infinite as common people do, and life grows possible again.\"Since mankind has existed, wherever life has been, there also has been the faith that gave the possibility of living. Faith is the sense oflife, that sense by virtue of which man does not destroy himself, but continues to live on. It is the force whereby we live. If Man did notbelieve that he must1H.

The idea of an infinite God, of the divinity of the soul, of the union of men's actions with God—these are ideas elaborated in the infinite secret depths of human thought. They are ideas without which there would be no life, withoutwhich I myself,\" said Tolstoy, \"would not exist. I began to see that I had no right to rely on my individual reasoning and neglect theseanswers given by faith, for they are the only answers to the question.\"Yet how believe as the common people believe, steeped as they are in grossest superstition? It is impossible,—but yettheir life! their life! It is normal. It is happy! It is an answer to the question!Little by little, Tolstoy came to the settled conviction—he says it took him two years to arrive there—that his troublehad not been with life in general, not with the common life of common men, but with the life of the upper,intellectual, artistic classes, the life which he had personally always led, the cerebral life, the life of conventionality,artificiality, and personal ambition. He had been living wrongly and must change. To work for animal needs, to abjurelies and vanities, to relieve common wants, to be simple, to believe in God, therein lay happiness again.\"I remember,\" he says, \"one day in early spring, I was alone in the forest, lending my ear to its mysterious noises. I listened, and mythought went back to what for these three years it always was busy with—the quest of God. But the idea of him, I said, how did I evercome by the idea?\"And again there arose in me, with this thought, glad aspirations towards life. Everything in me awoke and received a meaning. Why doI look farther? a voice within me asked. He is there: he, without whom one cannot live. To acknowledge God and to live are one and thesame thing. God is what life is. Well, then! live, seek God, and there will be no life without him. \"After this, things cleared up within me and about me better than ever, and the light has never wholly died away. I was saved fromsuicide. Just how or when the change took place I cannot tell. But as insensibly and gradually as"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP173 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 04]Page 173the force of life had been annulled within me, and I had reached my moral death-bed, just as gradually and imperceptibly did the energyof life come back. And what was strange was that this energy that came back was nothing new. It was my ancient juvenile force of faith,the belief that the sole purpose of my life was to be better. I gave up the life of the conventional world, recognizing it to be no life, but aparody on life, which its superfluities simply keep us from comprehending,'' —and Tolstoy thereupon embraced the life of the peasants,and has felt right and happy, or at least relatively so, ever since.1As I interpret his melancholy, then, it was not merely an accidental vitiation of his humors, though it was doubtlessalso that. It was logically called for by the clash between his inner character and his outer activities and aims.Although a literary artist, Tolstoy was one of those primitive oaks of men to whom the superfluities and insincerities,the cupidities, complications, and cruelties of our polite civilization are profoundly unsatisfying, and for whom theeternal veracities lie with more natural and animal things. His crisis was the getting of his soul in order, the discoveryof its genuine habitat and vocation, the escape from falsehoods into what for him were ways of truth. It was a case ofheterogeneous personality tardily and slowly finding its unity and level. And though not many of us can imitateTolstoy, not having enough, perhaps, of the aboriginal human marrow in our bones, most of us may at least feel as ifit might be better for us if we could.Bunyan's recovery seems to have been even slower. For years together he was alternately haunted with texts ofScripture, now up and now down, but at last with an ever growing relief in his salvation through the blood of Christ.\"My peace would be in and out twenty times a day; comfort now and trouble presently; peace now and before I could go a furlong as fullof guilt and fear as ever heart could hold.\" When a good text comes home to him, \"This,\" he writes, \"gave me good encouragement forthe1I have considerably abridged Tolstoy's words in my translation."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP174 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 06]Page 174space of two or three hours\"; or \"This was a good day to me, I hope I shall not forget it\"; or \"The glory of these words was then soweighty on me that I was ready to swoon as I sat; yet not with grief and trouble, but with solid joy and peace\"; or ''This made a strangeseizure on my spirit; it brought light with it, and commanded a silence in my heart of all those tumultuous thoughts that before did use,like masterless hell-hounds, to roar and bellow and make a hideous noise within me. It showed me that Jesus Christ had not quiteforsaken and cast off my Soul.\"Such periods accumulate until he can write: \"And now remained only the hinder part of the tempest, for the thunder was gone beyondme, only some drops would still remain, that now and then would fall upon me\";—and at last: \"Now did my chains fall off my legsindeed; I was loosed from my afflictions and irons; my temptations also fled away; so that from that time, those dreadful Scriptures ofGod left off to trouble me; now went I also home rejoicing, for the grace and love of God. Now could I see myself in Heaven and Earthat once; in Heaven by my Christ, by my Head, by my Righteousness and Life, though on Earth by my body or person. Christ was aprecious Christ to my soul that night; I could scarce lie in my bed for joy and peace and triumph through Christ.\"Bunyan became a minister of the gospel, and in spite of his neurotic constitution, and of the twelve years he lay inprison for his non-conformity, his life was turned to active use. He was a peacemaker and doer of good, and theimmortal Allegory which he wrote has brought the very spirit of religious patience home to English hearts.But neither Bunyan nor Tolstoy could become what we have called healthy-minded. They had drunk too deeply of thecup of bitterness ever to forget its taste, and their redemption is into a universe two stories deep. Each of themrealized a good which broke the effective edge of his sadness; yet the sadness was preserved as a minor ingredient inthe heart of the faith by which it was overcome. The fact of interest for us is that as a matter of fact they could and didfind something welling up in the inner reaches of their consciousness, by"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP175 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 07]Page 175which such extreme sadness could be overcome. Tolstoy does well to talk of it as that by which men live; for that isexactly what it is, a stimulus, an excitement, a faith, a force that reinfuses the positive willingness to live, even in fullpresence of the evil perceptions that erewhile made life seem unbearable. For Tolstoy's perceptions of evil appearwithin their sphere to have remained unmodified. His later works show him implacable to the whole system of officialvalues: the ignobility of fashionable life; the infamies of empire; the spuriousness of the church; the vain conceit ofthe professions; the meannesses and cruelties that go with great success; and every other pompous crime and lyinginstitution of this world. To all patience with such things his experience has been for him a permanent ministry ofdeath.Bunyan also leaves this world to the enemy.\"I must first pass a sentence of death,\" he says, \"upon everything that can properly be called a thing of this life, even to reckon myself,my wife, my children, my health, my enjoyments, and all, as dead to me, and myself as dead to them; to trust in God through Christ, astouching the world to come; and as touching this world, to count the grave my house, to make my bed in darkness, and to say tocorruption, Thou art my father, and to the worm, Thou are my mother and sister. The parting with my wife and my poor children hathoften been to me as the pulling of my flesh from my bones, especially my poor blind child who lay nearer my heart than all I had besides.Poor child, thought I, what sorrow art thou like to have for thy portion in this world! Thou must be beaten, must beg, suffer hunger,cold, nakedness, and a thousand calamities, though I cannot now endure that the wind should blow upon thee. But yet I must venture youall with God, though it goeth to the quick to leave you.\"1The 'hue of resolution' is there, but the full flood of ecstatic liberation seems never to have poured over poor JohnBunyan's soul.1In my quotations from Bunyan I have omitted certain intervening portions of the text."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP176 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 08]Page 176These examples may suffice to acquaint us in a general way with the phenomenon technically called 'Conversion.'

This at least is what conversion signifies in general terms, whether or not we believe that a direct divineoperation is needed to bring such a moral change about.Before entering upon a minuter study of the process, let me enliven our understanding of the definition by a concreteexample. I choose the quaint case of an unlettered man, Stephen H. Bradley, whose experience is related in a scarceAmerican pamphlet.1I select this case because it shows how in these inner alterations one may find one unsuspected depth below another,as if the possibilities of character lay disposed in a series of layers or shells, of whose existence we have nopremonitory knowledge.Bradley thought that he had been already fully converted at the age of fourteen.\"I thought I saw the Saviour, by faith, in human shape, for about one second in the room, with arms extended, appearing to say to me,Come. The next day I rejoiced with trembling; soon after, my happiness was so great that I said that I wanted to die; this world had noplace in my affections, as I knew of, and every day appeared as solemn to me as the Sabbath. I had an ardent desire that all mankindmight feel as I did; I wanted to have them all love God supremely. Previous to this time I was very selfish and selfrighteous; but now Idesired the welfare of all mankind, and could with a feeling heart forgive my worst enemies, and I felt as if I should be willing to bear thescoffs and1A sketch of the life of Stephen H.

This did not appearto satisfy them; they said they knew they had it. I requested them to pray for me, thinking with myself, that if I had not got religion now,after so long a time professing to be a Christian, that it was time I had, and hoped their prayers would be answered in my behalf.\"One Sabbath, I went to hear the Methodist at the Academy. He spoke of the ushering in of the day of general judgment; and he set itforth in such a solemn and terrible manner as I never heard before. The scene of that day appeared to be taking place, and so awakenedwere all the powers of my mind that, like Felix, I trembled involuntarily on the bench where I was sitting, though I felt nothing at heart.The next day evening I went to hear him again. He took his text from Revelation: 'And I saw the dead, small and great, stand beforeGod.' And he represented the terrors of that day in such a manner that it appeared as if it would melt the heart of stone. When he finishedhis discourse, an old gentleman turned to me and said, 'This is what I call preaching.' I thought the same; but my feelings were stillunmoved by what he said, and I did not enjoy religion, but I believe he did.\"I will now relate my experience of the power of the Holy Spirit which took place on the same night. Had any person told me previous tothis that I could have experienced the power of the Holy Spirit in the manner which I did, I could not have believed it, and should havethought the person deluded that told me so. I went directly home after the meeting, and when I got home I wondered what made me feelso stupid. I retired to rest soon after I got home, and felt indifferent to the things of religion until I began to be exercised by the HolySpirit, which began in about five minutes after, in the following manner:—"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP179 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 12]Page 179\"At first, I began to feel my heart beat very quick all on a sudden, which made me at first think that perhaps something is going to ail me,though I was not alarmed, for I felt no pain. My heart increased in its beating, which soon convinced me that it was the Holy Spirit fromthe effect it had on me. I began to feel exceedingly happy and humble, and such a sense of unworthiness as I never felt before. I couldnot very well help speaking out, which I did, and said, Lord, I do not deserve this happiness, or words to that effect, while there was astream (resembling air in feeling) came into my mouth and heart in a more sensible manner than that of drinking anything, whichcontinued, as near as I could judge, five minutes or more, which appeared to be the cause of such a palpitation of my heart. It tookcomplete possession of my soul, and I am certain that I desired the Lord, while in the midst of it, not to give me any more happiness, forit seemed as if I could not contain what I had got. My heart seemed as if it would burst, but it did not stop until I felt as if I wasunutterably full of the love and grace of God. In the mean time while thus exercised, a thought arose in my mind, what can it mean? andall at once, as if to answer it, my memory became exceedingly clear, and it appeared to me just as if the New Testament was placed openbefore me, eighth chapter of Romans, and as light as if some candle lighted was held for me to read the 26th and 27th verses of thatchapter, and I read these words: 'The Spirit helpeth our infirmities with groanings which cannot be uttered.' And all the time that myheart was a-beating, it made me groan like a person in distress, which was not very easy to stop, though I was in no pain at all, and mybrother being in bed in another room came and opened the door, and asked me if I had got the toothache. I told him no, and that he mightget to sleep. I tried to stop. I felt unwilling to go to sleep myself, I was so happy, fearing I should lose it—thinking within myself'My willing soul would stayIn such a frame as this.'And while I lay reflecting, after my heart stopped beating,"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP180 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 13]Page 180feeling as if my soul was full of the Holy Spirit, I thought that perhaps there might be angels hovering round my bed. I felt just as if Iwanted to converse with them, and finally I spoke, saying, 'O ye affectionate angels! how is it that ye can take so much interest in ourwelfare, and we take so little interest in our own.' After this, with difficulty I got to sleep; and when I awoke in the morning my firstthoughts were: What has become of my happiness? and, feeling a degree of it in my heart, I asked for more, which was given to me asquick as thought. I then got up to dress myself, and found to my surprise that I could but just stand. It appeared to me as if it was a littleheaven upon earth. My soul felt as completely raised above the fears of death as of going to sleep; and like a bird in a cage, I had adesire, if it was the will of God, to get released from my body and to dwell with Christ, though willing to live to do good to others, andto warn sinners to repent. I went downstairs feeling as solemn as if I had lost all my friends, and thinking with myself, that I would notlet my parents know it until I had first looked into the Testament. I went directly to the shelf and looked into it, at the eighth chapter ofRomans, and every verse seemed to almost speak and to confirm it to be truly the Word of God, and as if my feelings corresponded withthe meaning of the word. I then told my parents of it, and told them that I thought that they must see that when I spoke, that it was notmy own voice, for it appeared so to me. My speech seemed entirely under the control of the Spirit. within me; I do not mean that thewords which I spoke were not my own, for they were. I thought that I was influenced similar to the Apostles on the day of Pentecost(with the exception of having power to give it to others, and doing what they did). After breakfast I went round to converse with myneighbors on religion, which I could not have been hired to have done before this, and at their request I prayed with them, though I hadnever prayed in public before.\"I now feel as if I had discharged my duty by telling the truth, and hope by the blessing of God, it may do some good to all who shallread it.

Nowfor a minuter survey of the constituent elements of the conversion process.If you open the chapter on Association, of any treatise on Psychology, you will read that a man's ideas, aims, andobjects form diverse internal groups and systems, relatively independent of one another. Each 'aim' which he followsawakens a certain specific kind of interested excitement, and gathers a certain group of ideas together in subordinationto it as its associates; and if the aims and excitements are distinct in kind, their groups of ideas may have little incommon. When one group is present and engrosses the interest, all the ideas connected with other groups may beexcluded from the mental field. The President of the United States when, with paddle, gun, and fishing-rod, he goescamping in the wilderness for a vacation, changes his system of ideas from top to bottom. The presidential anxietieshave lapsed into the background entirely; the official habits are replaced by the habits of a son of nature, and thosewho knew the man only as the strenuous magistrate would not 'know him for the same person' if they saw him as thecamper.If now he should never go back, and never again suffer political interests to gain dominion over him, he would be forpractical intents and purposes a permanently transformed being. Our ordinary alterations of character, as we pass fromone of our aims to another, are not commonly called transformations, because each of them is so rapidly succeeded byanother in the reverse direction; but whenever one aim grows so stable as to expel definitively its previous rivals fromthe individual's life, we tend to speak of the phenomenon, and perhaps to wonder at it, as a 'transformation.'These alternations are the completest of the ways in which a self may be divided. A less complete way is thesimultaneous coexistence of two or more different groups of aims, of which one practically holds the right of way andinstigates activity,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP182 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 16]Page 182whilst the others are only pious wishes, and never practically come to anything. Saint Augustine's aspirations to apurer life, in our last lecture, were for a while an example. Another would be the President in his full pride of office,wondering whether it were not all vanity, and whether the life of a wood-chopper were not the wholesomer destiny.Such fleeting aspirations are mere velleitates, whimsies. They exist on the remoter skirts of the mind, and the real selfof the man, the centre of his energies, is occupied with an entirely different system. As life goes on, there is a constantchange of our interests, and a consequent change of place in our systems of ideas, from more central to moreperipheral, and from more peripheral to more central parts of consciousness. I remember, for instance, that oneevening when I was a youth, my father read aloud from a Boston newspaper that part of Lord Gifford's will whichfounded these four lectureships. At that time I did not think of being a teacher of philosophy: and what I listened towas as remote from my own life as if it related to the planet Mars. Yet here I am, with the Gifford system part andparcel of my very self, and all my energies, for the time being, devoted to successfully identifying myself with it. Mysoul stands now planted in what once was for it a practically unreal object, and speaks from it as from its properhabitat and centre.When I say 'Soul,' you need not take me in the ontological sense unless you prefer to; for although ontologicallanguage is instinctive in such matters, yet Buddhists or Humians can perfectly well describe the facts in thephenomenal terms which are their favorites. For them the soul is only a succession of fields of consciousness: yetthere is found in each field a part, or sub-field, which figures as focal and contains the excitement, and from which,as from a centre, the aim seems to be taken. Talking of this part, we involuntarily apply words of perspective todistinguish it from the rest, words like 'here,' 'this,' 'now,' 'mine,' or 'me'; and we ascribe to the other parts the positions'there,' 'then,' 'that,' 'his' or 'thine,' 'it,' 'not me.' But a 'here' can change to a 'there,' and a 'there' become a 'here,' andwhat was 'mine' and what was 'not mine' change their places.What brings such changes about is the way in which emo-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP183 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 17]Page 183tional excitement alters. Things hot and vital to us to-day are cold to-morrow. It is as if seen from the hot parts of thefield that the other parts appear to us, and from these hot parts personal desire and volition make their sallies. Theyare in short the centres of our dynamic energy, whereas the cold parts leave us indifferent and passive in proportion totheir coldness.Whether such language be rigorously exact is for the present of no importance. It is exact enough, if you recognizefrom your own experience the facts which I seek to designate by it.Now there may be great oscillation in the emotional interest, and the hot places may shift before one almost as rapidlyas the sparks that run through burnt-up paper. Then we have the wavering and divided self we heard so much of in theprevious lecture. Or the focus of excitement and heat, the point of view from which the aim is taken, may come to liepermanently within a certain system; and then, if the change be a religious one, we call it a conversion, especially if itbe by crisis, or sudden.Let us hereafter, in speaking of the hot place in a man's consciousness, the group of ideas to which he devotes himself,and from which he works, call it the habitual centre of his personal energy. It makes a great difference to a manwhether one set of his ideas, or another, be the centre of his energy; and it makes a great difference, as regards any setof ideas which he may possess, whether they become central or remain peripheral in him. To say that a man is'converted' means, in these terms, that religious ideas, previously peripheral in his consciousness, now take a centralplace, and that religious aims form the habitual centre of his energy.Now if you ask of psychology just how the excitement shifts in a man's mental system, and why aims that wereperipheral become at a certain moment central, psychology has to reply that although she can give a generaldescription of what happens, she is unable in a give case to account accurately for all the single forces at work.Neither an outside observer nor the Subject who undergoes the process can explain fully how particular experiencesare able to change one's centre of energy so decisively, or why they so often have to bide their"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP184 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 18]Page 184hour to do so. We have a thought, or we perform an act, repeatedly, but on a certain day the real meaning of thethought peals through us for the first time, or the act has suddenly turned into a moral impossibility. All we know isthat there are dead feelings, dead ideas, and cold beliefs, and there are hot and live ones; and when one grows hot andalive within us, everything has to re-crystallize about it. We may say that the heat and liveliness mean only the 'motorefficacy,' long deferred but now operative, of the idea; but such talk itself is only circumlocution, for whence thesudden motor efficacy? And our explanations then get so vague and general that one realizes all the more the intenseindividuality of the whole phenomenon.In the end we fall back on the hackneyed symbolism of a mechanical equilibrium. A mind is a system of ideas, eachwith the excitement it arouses, and with tendencies impulsive and inhibitive, which mutually check or reinforce oneanother. The collection of ideas alters by subtraction or by addition in the course of experience, and the tendenciesalter as the organism gets more aged. A mental system may be undermined or weakened by this interstitial alterationjust as a building is, and yet for a time keep upright by dead habit. But a new perception, a sudden emotional shock,or an occasion which lays bare the organic alteration, will make the whole fabric fall together; and then the centre ofgravity sinks into an attitude more stable, for the new ideas that reach the centre in the rearrangement seem now to belocked there, and the new structure remains permanent.Formed associations of ideas and habits are usually factors of retardation in such changes of equilibrium. Newinformation, however acquired, plays an accelerating part in the changes; and the slow mutation of our instincts andpropensities, under the 'unimaginable touch of time' has an enormous influence. Moreover, all these influences maywork subconsciously or half unconsciously.1 And when you get a1 Jouffroy is an example: ''Down this slope it was that my intelligence had glided, and little by little it had got far from its first faith. Butthis melancholy revolution had not taken place in the broad daylight of my consciousness; too many scruples, too many guides andsacred affections had made it dread-(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP185 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 25]Page 185Subject in whom the subconscious life—of which I must speak more fully soon—is largely developed, and in whommotives habitually ripen in silence, you get a case of which you can never give a full account, and in which, both tothe Subject and the onlookers, there may appear an element of marvel. Emotional occasions, especially violent ones,are extremely potent in precipitating mental rearrangements. The sudden and explosive ways in which love, jealousy,guilt, fear, remorse, or anger can seize upon one are known to everybody.1 Hope, happiness, security, resolve,emotions characteristic of conversion, can be equally explosive. And emotions that come in this explosive wayseldom leave things as they found them.In his recent work on the Psychology of Religion, Professor Starbuck of California has shown by a statistical inquiryhow closely parallel in its manifestations the ordinary 'conversion' which occurs in young people brought up inevangelical circles is to that growth into a larger spiritual life which is a normal phase of adolescence in every class ofhuman beings. The age is the same, falling usually between fourteen and seventeen. The symptoms are the same,—sense of incompleteness and imperfection; brooding, depression, morbid introspection, and sense of sin; anxiety aboutthe(Footnote continued from previous page)ful to me, so that I was far from avowing to myself the progress it had made. It had gone on in silence, by an involuntary elaboration ofwhich I was not the accomplice; and although I had in reality long ceased to be a Christian, yet, in the innocence of my intention, Ishould have shuddered to suspect it, and thought it calumny had I been accused of such a falling away.\" Then follows Jouffroy's accountof his counter-conversion, quoted above on p. 164.1One hardly needs examples; but for love, see p. 167, note; for fear, p. 149; for remorse, see Othello after the murder; for anger, see Learafter Cordelia's first speech to him; for resolve, see p. 165 (J. Foster case). Here is a pathological case in which guilt was the feeling thatsuddenly exploded: \"One night I was seized on entering bed with a rigor, such as Swedenborg describes as coming over him with a sense ofholiness, but over me with a sense of guilt. During that whole night I lay under the influence of the rigor, and from its inception I felt that Iwas under the curse of God. I have never done one act of duty in my life—sins against God and man, beginning as far as my memory goesback—a wildcat in human shape.\""},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP186 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 27]Page 186hereafter; distress over doubts, and the like. And the result is the same,—a happy relief and objectivity, as theconfidence in self gets greater through the adjustment of the faculties to the wider outlook. In spontaneous religiousawakening, apart from revivalistic examples, and in the ordinary storm and stress and moulting-time of adolescence,we also may meet with mystical experiences, astonishing the subjects by their suddenness, just as in revivalisticconversion. The analogy, in fact, is complete; and Starbuck's conclusion as to these ordinary youthful conversionswould seem to be the only sound one: Conversion is in its essence a normal adolescent phenomenon, incidental to thepassage from the child's small universe to the wider intellectual and spiritual life of maturity.\"Theology,\" says Dr. Starbuck, \"takes the adolescent tendencies and builds upon them; it sees that the essential thingin adolescent growth is bringing the person out of childhood into the new life of maturity and personal insight. Itaccordingly brings those means to bear which will intensify the normal tendencies. It shortens up the period ofduration of storm and stress.\" The conversion phenomena of 'conviction of sin' last, by this investigator's statistics,about one fifth as long as the periods of adolescent storm and stress phenomena of which he also got statistics, butthey are very much more intense. Bodily accompaniments, loss of sleep and appetite, for example, are much morefrequent in them. \"The essential distinction appears to be that conversion intensifies but shortens the period bybringing the person to a definite crisis.''1The conversions which Dr. Starbuck here has in mind are of course mainly those of very commonplace persons, kepttrue to a pre-appointed type by instruction, appeal, and example. The particular form which they affect is the result ofsuggestion and imitation.2 If they went through their1E. D. STARBUCK: The Psychology of Religion, pp. 224, 262.2No one understands this better than Jonathan Edwards understood it already. Conversion narratives of the more commonplace sort mustalways be taken with the allowances which he suggests: \"A rule received and established by common consent has a very great, though tomany persons an insensible influence in forming their notions of the process of their own experience. I know very well how they proceed asto this matter, for I have had frequent opportunities of observing their conduct. Very often their experience at first(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP187 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 39]Page 187growth-crisis in other faiths and other countries, although the essence of the change would be the same (since it is onein the main so inevitable), its accidents would be different. In Catholic lands, for example, and in our ownEpiscopalian sects, no such anxiety and conviction of sin is usual as in sects that encourage revivals. The sacramentsbeing more relied on in these more strictly ecclesiastical bodies, the individual's personal acceptance of salvationneeds less to be accentuated and led up to.But every imitative phenomenon must once have had its original, and I propose that for the future we keep as close asmay be to the more first-hand and original forms of experience. These are more likely to be found in sporadic adultcases.Professor Leuba, in a valuable article on the psychology of conversion,1 subordinates the theological aspect of thereligious life almost entirely to its moral aspect. The religious sense he defines as \"the feeling of un wholeness, ofmoral imperfection, of sin, to use the technical word, accompanied by the yearning after the peace of unity.\" \"Theword 'religion,'\" he says, \"is getting more and more to signify the conglomerate of desires and emotions springingfrom the sense of sin and its release\"; and he gives a large number of examples, in which the sin ranges fromdrunkenness to spiritual pride, to show that the sense of it may beset one and crave relief as urgently as does theanguish of the sickened flesh or any form of physical misery.Undoubtedly this conception covers an immense number of cases. A good one to use as an example is that of Mr. S.H.(Footnote continued from previous page)appears like a confused chaos, but then those parts are selected which bear the nearest resemblance to such particular steps as are insistedon; and these are dwelt upon in their thoughts, and spoken of from time to time, till they grow more and more conspicuous in their view,and other parts which are neglected grow more and more obscure. Thus what they have experienced is insensibly strained, so as to bringit to an exact conformity to the scheme already established in their minds. And it becomes natural also for ministers, who have to dealwith those who insist upon distinctness and clearness of method, to do so too.\" Treatise on Religious Affections.1Studies in the Psychology of Religious Phenomena, American Journal of Psychology, vii. 309 (1896)."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP188 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 41]Page 188Hadley, who after his conversion became an active and useful rescuer of drunkards in New York. His experience runsas follows:—\"One Tuesday evening I sat in a saloon in Harlem, a homeless, friendless, dying drunkard. I had pawned or sold everything that wouldbring a drink. I could not sleep unless I was dead drunk. I had not eaten for days, and for four nights preceding I had suffered withdelirium tremens, or the horrors, from midnight till morning. I had often said, 'I will never be a tramp. I will never be cornered, for whenthat time comes, if ever it comes, I will find a home in the bottom of the river.' But the Lord so ordered it that when that time did come Iwas not able to walk one quarter of the way to the river. As I sat there thinking, I seemed to feel some great and mighty presence. I didnot know then what it was. I did learn afterwards that it was Jesus, the sinner's friend. I walked up to the bar and pounded it with my fisttill I made the glasses rattle. Those who stood by drinking looked on with scornful curiosity. I said I would never take another drink, if Idied on the street, and really I felt as though that would happen before morning. Something said, 'If you want to keep this promise, goand have yourself locked up.' I went to the nearest station-house and had myself locked up.\"I was placed in a narrow cell, and it seemed as though all the demons that could find room came in that place with me. This was not allthe company I had, either. No, praise the Lord; that dear Spirit that came to me in the saloon was present, and said, Pray. I did pray, andthough I did not feel any great help, I kept on praying. As soon as I was able to leave my cell I was taken to the police court andremanded back to the cell. I was finally released, and found my way to my brother's house, where every care was given me. While lyingin bed the admonishing Spirit never left me, and when I arose the following Sabbath morning I felt that day would decide my fate, andtoward evening it came into my head to go to Jerry M'Auley's Mission. I went. The house was packed, and"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP189 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 42]Page 189with great difficulty I made my way to the space near the platform. There I saw the apostle to the drunkard and the outcast—that man ofGod, Jerry M'Auley. He rose, and amid deep silence told his experience. There was a sincerity about this man that carried convictionwith it, and I found myself saying, 'I wonder if God can save me?' I listened to the testimony of twenty-five or thirty persons, every oneof whom had been saved from rum, and I made up my mind that I would be saved or die right there. When the invitation was given, Iknelt down with a crowd of drunkards. Jerry made the first prayer. Then Mrs. M'Auley prayed fervently for us. Oh, what a conflict wasgoing on for my poor soul! A blessed whisper said, 'Come'; the devil said, 'Be careful.' I halted but a moment, and then, with a breakingheart, I said, 'Dear Jesus, can you help me?' Never with mortal tongue can I describe that moment. Although up to that moment my soulhad been filled with indescribable gloom, I felt the glorious brightness of the noonday sun shine into my heart. I felt I was a free man.Oh, the precious feeling of safety, of freedom, of resting on Jesus! I felt that Christ with all his brightness and power had come into mylife; that, indeed, old things had passed away and all things had become new.\"From that moment till now I have never wanted a drink of whiskey, and I have never seen money enough to make me take one. Ipromised God that night that if he would take away the appetite for strong drink, I would work for him all my life. He has done his part,and I have been trying to do mine.\"1Dr. Leuba rightly remarks that there is little doctrinal theology in such an experience, which starts with the absoluteneed of a higher helper, and ends with the sense that he has helped us. He gives other cases of drunkards' conversionswhich are purely ethical, containing, as recorded, no theo-1 I have abridged Mr. Hadley's account.

John B. Gough's case, for instance, is practically, says Dr. Leuba, the conversion of an atheist— neither God nor Jesus being mentioned.1 But in spite of the importance of this type of regeneration, with little orno intellectual readjustment, this writer surely makes it too exclusive. It corresponds to the subjectively centred formof morbid melancholy, of which Bunyan and Aline were examples. But we saw in our seventh lecture that there areobjective forms of melancholy also, in which the lack of rational meaning of the universe, and of life anyhow, is theburden that weighs upon one—you remember Tolstoy's case.2 So there are distinct elements in conversion, and theirrelations to individual lives deserve to be discriminated.3Some persons, for instance, never are, and possibly never under any circumstances could be, converted. Religiousideas cannot become the centre of their spiritual energy. They may be excellent persons, servants of God in practicalways, but they are not children of his kingdom. They are either incapable of imagining the invisible; or else, in thelanguage of devotion, they are life-long subjects of 'barrenness' and 'dryness.' Such inaptitude for religious faith mayin some cases be intellectual in its origin. Their religious facilties may be checked in their natural tendency to expand,by beliefs about the world that are inhibitive, the pessimistic and materialistic beliefs, for example, within which somany good souls, who in former times would have freely indulged their religious propensities, find themselvesnowadays, as it were, frozen; or the agnostic vetoes upon faith as something weak and1A restaurant waiter served provisionally as Gough's 'Saviour.' General Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, considers that the firstvital step in saving outcasts consists in making them feel that some decent human being cares enough for them to take an interest in thequestion whether they are to rise or sink.2The crisis of apathetic melancholy—no use in life—into which J. S. Mill records that he fell, and from which he emerged by the reading ofMarmontel's Memoris (Heaven save the mark!) and Wordsworth's poetry, is another intellectual and general metaphysical case. See Mill'sAutobiography, New York, 1873, pp. 141, 148.3Starbuck, in addition to 'escape from sin,' discriminates 'spiritual illumination' as a distinct type of conversion experience. Psychology ofReligion, p. 85."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP191 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 44]Page 191shameful, under which so many of us to-day lie cowering, afraid to use our instincts. In many persons suchinhibitions are never overcome. To the end of their days they refuse to believe, their personal energy never gets to itsreligious centre, and the latter remains inactive in perpetuity.In other persons the trouble is profounder. There are men anæsthetic on the religious side, deficient in that category ofsensibility. Just as a bloodless organism can never, in spite of all its goodwill, attain to the reckless 'animal spirits'enjoyed by those of sanguine temperament; so the nature which is spiritually barren may admire and envy faith inothers, but can never compass the enthusiasm and peace which those who are temperamentally qualified for faithenjoy. All this may, however, turn out eventually to have been a matter of temporary inhibition. Even late in life somethaw, some release may take place, some bolt be shot back in the barrenest breast, and the man's hard heart maysoften and break into religious feeling. Such cases more than any others suggest the idea that sudden conversion is bymiracle. So long as they exist, we must not imagine ourselves to deal with irretrievably fixed classes.Now there are two forms of mental occurrence in human beings, which lead to a striking difference in the conversionprocess, a difference to which Professor Starbuck has called attention. You know how it is when you try to recollect aforgotten name. Usually you help the recall by working for it, by mentally running over the places, persons, and thingswith which the word was connected. But sometimes this effort fails: you feel then as if the harder you tried the lesshope there would be, as though the name were jammed, and pressure in its direction only kept it all the more fromrising. And then the opposite expedient often succeeds. Give up the effort entirely; think of something altogetherdifferent, and in half an hour the lost name comes sauntering into your mind, as Emerson says, as carelessly as if ithad never been invited. Some hidden process was started in you by the effort, which went on after the effort ceased,and made the result come as if it came spontaneously. A certain music teacher, says Dr. Starbuck, says to her pupilsafter the thing to be done has"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP192 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 46]Page 192been clearly pointed out, and unsuccessfully attempted: \"Stop trying and it will do itself!\"1There is thus a conscious and voluntary way and an involuntary and unconscious way in which mental results may getaccomplished; and we find both ways exemplified in the history of conversion, giving us two types, which Starbuckcalls the volitional type and the type by self-surrender respectively.In the volitional type the regenerative change is usually gradual, and consists in the building up, piece by piece, of anew set of moral and spiritual habits. But there are always critical points here at which the movement forward seemsmuch more rapid. This psychological fact is abundantly illustrated by Dr. Starbuck. Our education in any practicalaccomplishment proceeds apparently by jerks and starts, just as the growth of our physical bodies does.\"An athlete sometimes awakens suddenly to an understanding of the fine points of the game and to a real enjoyment of it, just as theconvert awakens to an appreciation of religion. If he keeps on engaging in the sport, there may come a day when all at once the gameplays itself through him—when he loses himself in some great contest. In the same way, a musician may suddenly reach a point at whichpleasure in the technique of the art entirely falls away, and in some moment of inspiration he becomes the instrument through whichmusic flows. The writer has chanced to hear two different married persons, both of whose wedded lives had been beautiful from thebeginning, relate that not until a year or more after marriage did they awake to the full blessedness of married life. So it is with thereligious experience of these persons we are studying.\"2We shall erelong hear still more remarkable illustrations of subconsciously maturing processes eventuating in resultsof which we suddenly grow conscious.

The facts are now known to us far more extensively than he could know them, and the adjective 'unconscious,'being for many of them almost certainly a misnomer, is better replaced by the vaguer term 'subconscious' or'subliminal.'Of the volitional type of conversion it would be easy to give examples,1 but they are as a rule less interesting thanthose of the self-surrender type, in which the subconscious effects are more abundant and often startling. I willtherefore hurry to the latter, the more so because the difference between the two types is after all not radical. Even inthe most voluntarily built-up sort of regeneration there are passages of partial self-surrender interposed; and in thegreat majority of all cases, when the will has done its uttermost towards bringing one close to the complete unificationaspired after, it1For instance, C. G. Finney italicizes the volitional element: \"Just at this point the whole question of Gospel salvation opened to my mindin a manner most marvelous to me at the time. I think I then saw, as clearly as I ever have in my life, the reality and fullness of theatonement of Christ. Gospel salvation seemed to me to be an offer of something to be accepted, and all that was necessary on my partwas to get my own consent to give up my sins and accept Christ. After this distinct revelation had stood for some little time before mymind, the question seemed to be put, 'Will you accept it now, today?' I replied, 'Yes; I will accept it to-day, or I will die in the attempt!'\"He then went into the woods, where he describes his struggles. He could not pray, his heart was hardened in its pride. \"I then reproachedmyself for having promised to give my heart to God before I left the woods. When I came to try, I found I could not. My inward soulhung back, and there was no going out of my heart to God. The thought was pressing me, of the rashness of my promise that I wouldgive my heart to God that day, or die in the attempt. It seemed to me as if that was binding on my soul; and yet I was going to break myvow. A great sinking and discouragement came over me, and I felt almost too weak to stand upon my knees. Just at this moment I againthought I heard some one approach me, and I opened my eyes to see whether it were so. But right there the revelation of my pride ofheart, as the great difficulty that stood in the way, was distinctly shown to me. An over-whelming sense of my wickedness in beingashamed to have a human being see me on my knees before God took such powerful possession of me, that I cried at the top of my voice,and exclaimed that I would not leave that place if all the men on earth and all the devils in hell surrounded me. 'What!' I said, 'such adegraded sinner as I am, on my knees confessing my sins to the great and holy God; and ashamed to have any human being, and a sinnerlike myself, find me on my knees endeavoring to make my peace with my offended God!' The sin appeared awful, infinite. It broke medown before the Lord.\" Memoirs, pp. 14 16, abridged."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP194 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 48]Page 194seems that the very last step must be left to other forces and performed without the help of its activity. In other words,self-surrender becomes then indispensable. \"The personal will,\" says Dr. Starbuck, \"must be given up. In many casesrelief persistently refuses to come until the person ceases to resist, or to make an effort in the direction he desires togo.\"\"I had said I would not give up; but when my will was broken, it was all over,\" writes one of Starbuck's correspondents.—Another says:\"I simply said: 'Lord, I have done all I can; I leave the whole matter with Thee;' and immediately there came to me a great peace.\"—Another: \"All at once it occurred to me that I might be saved, too, if I would stop trying to do it all myself, and follow Jesus: somehow Ilost my load.\"—Another: \"I finally ceased to resist, and gave myself up, though it was a hard struggle. Gradually the feeling came overme that I had done my part, and God was willing to do his.\"1—\"Lord, Thy will be done; damn or save!'' cries John Nelson,2 exhaustedwith the anxious struggle to escape damnation; and at that moment his soul was filled with peace.Dr. Starbuck gives an interesting, and it seems to me a true, account—so far as conceptions so schematic can claimtruth at all—of the reasons why self-surrender at the last moment should be so indispensable. To begin with, there aretwo things in the mind of the candidate for conversion: first, the present incompleteness or wrongness, the 'sin' whichhe is eager to escape from; and, second, the positive ideal which he longs to compass. Now with most of us the senseof our present wrongness is a far more distinct piece of our consciousness than is the imagination of any positive idealwe can aim at. In a majority of cases, indeed, the 'sin' almost exclusively engrosses the attention, so that conversion is\"a process of struggling away from sin rather than of striving towards righteousness.\"3 A man's conscious wit andwill, so far as they strain towards the ideal, are aiming at something only dimly and inaccurately imagined. Yet all thewhile the forces of mere1STARBUCK: Op. cit., pp. 91, 114.2Extracts from the Journal of Mr. John Nelson, London, no date, p. 24.3STARBUCK, p. 64."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP195 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 50]Page 195organic ripening within him are going on towards their own prefigured result, and his conscious strainings are lettingloose subconscious allies behind the scenes, which in their way work towards rearrangement; and the rearrangementtowards which all these deeper forces tend is pretty surely definite, and definitely different from what he consciouslyconceives and determines. It may consequently be actually interfered with (jammed, as it were, like the lost wordwhen we seek too energetically to recall it), by his voluntary efforts slanting from the true direction.Starbuck seems to put his finger on the root of the matter when he says that to exercise the personal will is still to livein the region where the imperfect self is the thing most emphasized. Where, on the contrary, the subconscious forcestake the lead, it is more probably the better self in posse which directs the operation. Instead of being clumsily andvaguely aimed at from without, it is then itself the organizing centre. What then must the person do? \"He must relax,\"says Dr. Starbuck,—\"that is, he must fall back on the larger Power that makes for righteousness, which has beenwelling up in his own being, and let it finish in its own way the work it has begun. The act of yielding, in this pointof view, is giving one's self over to the new life, making it the centre of a new personality, and living, from within,the truth of it which had before been viewed objectively.\"1\"Man's extremity is God's opportunity\" is the theological way of putting this fact of the need of self-surrender; whilstthe physiological way of stating it would be, \"Let one do all in one's power, and one's nervous system will do therest.\" Both statements acknowledge the same fact.2To state it in terms of our own symbolism: When the new centre of personal energy has been subconsciouslyincubated so long as to be just ready to open into flower, 'hands off' is the only word for us, it must burst forthunaided!We have used the vague and abstract language of psychology. But since, in any terms, the crisis described is thethrowing of our conscious selves upon the mercy of powers which, whatever they may be, are more ideal than we areactually,1STARBUCK, p. 115.2STARBUCK, p. 113."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP196 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 51]Page 196and make for our redemption, you see why self-surrender has been and always must be regarded as the vital turning-point of the religious life, so far as the religious life is spiritual and no affair of outer works and ritual and sacraments.One may say that the whole development of Christianity in inwardness has consisted in little more than the greaterand greater emphasis attached to this crisis of self-surrender. From Catholicism to Lutheranism, and then toCalvinism; from that to Wesleyanism; and from this, outside of technical Christianity altogether, to pure 'liberalism' ortranscendental idealism, whether or not of the mind-cure type, taking in the mediæval mystics, the quietists, thepietists, and quakers by the way, we can trace the stages of progress towards the idea of an immediate spiritual help,experienced by the individual in his forlornness and standing in no essential need of doctrinal apparatus or propitiatorymachinery.Psychology and religion are thus in perfect harmony up to this point, since both admit that there are forces seeminglyoutside of the conscious individual that bring redemption to his life. Nevertheless psychology, defining these forces as'subconscious,' and speaking of their effects as due to 'incubation,' or 'cerebration,' implies that they do not transcendthe individual's personality; and herein she diverges from Christian theology, which insists that they are directsupernatural operations of the Deity. I propose to you that we do not yet consider this divergence final, but leave thequestion for a while in abeyance—continued inquiry may enable us to get rid of some of the apparent discord.Revert, then, for a moment more to the psychology of self-surrender.When you find a man living on the ragged edge of his consciousness, pent in to his sin and want and incompleteness,and consequently inconsolable, and then simply tell him that all is well with him, that he must stop his worry, breakwith his discontent, and give up his anxiety, you seem to him to come with pure absurdities. The only positiveconsciousness he has tells him that all is not well, and the better way you offer sounds simply as if you proposed tohim to assert cold-blooded falsehoods. 'The will to believe' cannot be stretched"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP197 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 53]Page 197as far as that. We can make ourselves more faithful to a belief of which we have the rudiments, but we cannot create abelief out of whole cloth when our perception actively assures us of its opposite. The better mind proposed to uscomes in that case in the form of a pure negation of the only mind we have, and we cannot actively will a purenegation.There are only two ways in which it is possible to get rid of anger, worry, fear, despair, or other undesirableaffections. One is that an opposite affection should overpoweringly break over us, and the other is by getting soexhausted with the struggle that we have to stop,—so we drop down, give up, and don't care any longer. Ouremotional brain-centres strike work, and we lapse into a temporary apathy. Now there is documentary proof that thisstate of temporary exhaustion not infrequently forms part of the conversion crisis. So long as the egoistic worry of thesick soul guards the door, the expansive confidence of the soul of faith gains no presence. But let the former faintaway, even but for a moment, and the latter can profit by the opportunity, and, having once acquired possession, mayretain it. Carlyle's Teufelsdröckh passes from the everlasting No to the everlasting Yes through a 'Centre ofIndifference.'Let me give you a good illustration of this feature in the conversion process. That genuine saint, David Brainerd,describes his own crisis in the following words:—\"One morning, while I was walking in a solitary place as usual, I at once saw that all my contrivances and projects to effect or procuredeliverance and salvation for myself were utterly in vain; I was brought quite to a stand, as finding myself totally lost. I saw that it wasforever impossible for me to do anything towards helping or delivering myself, that I had made all the pleas I ever could have made to alleternity; and that all my pleas were vain, for I saw that self-interest had led me to pray, and that I had never once prayed from anyrespect to the glory of God. I saw that there was no necessary connection between my prayers and the bestowment of divine mercy; thatthey laid not the least obligation upon God to bestow his grace upon me; and that there was no more virtue or goodness in them"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP198 hl[27 02 2011 00 34 54]Page 198than there would be in my paddling with my hand in the water. I saw that I had been heaping up my devotions before God, fasting,praying, etc., pretending, and indeed really thinking sometimes that I was aiming at the glory of God; whereas I never once truly intendedit, but only my own happiness. I saw that as I had never done anything for God, I had no claim on anything from him but perdition, onaccount of my hypocrisy and mockery. When I saw evidently that I had regard to nothing but self-interest, then my duties appeared avile mockery and a continual course of lies, for the whole was nothing but self-worship, and an horrid abuse of God.\"I continued, as I remember, in this state of mind, from Friday morning till the Sabbath evening following (July 12, 1739), when I waswalking again in the same solitary place. Here, in a mournful melancholy state I was attempting to pray; but found no heart to engage inthat or any other duty; my former concern, exercise, and religious affections were now gone. I thought that the Spirit of God had quiteleft me; but still was not distressed; yet disconsolate, as if there was nothing in heaven or earth could make me happy. Having been thusendeavoring to pray—though, as I thought, very stupid and senseless—for near half an hour; then, as I was walking in a thick grove,unspeakable glory seemed to open to the apprehension of my soul. I do not mean any external brightness, nor any imagination of a bodyof light, but it was a new inward apprehension or view that I had of God, such as I never had before, nor anything which had the leastresemblance to it. I had no particular apprehension of any one person in the Trinity, either the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost; but itappeared to be Divine glory. My soul rejoiced with joy unspeakable, to see such a God, such a glorious Divine Being; and I wasinwardly pleased and satisfied that he should be God over all for ever and ever. My soul was so captivated and delighted with theexcellency of God that I was even swallowed up in him; at least to that degree that I had no thought about my own salvation, and scarcereflected that there was such a creature as myself. I continued in this state of inward joy, peace, and astonishment, till near dark withoutany sensible abatement; and"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP199 hl[27 02 2011 00 35 01]Page 199then began to think and examine what I had seen; and felt sweetly composed in my mind all the evening following. I felt myself in a newworld, and everything about me appeared with a different aspect from what it was wont to do. At this time, the way of salvation openedto me with such infinite wisdom, suitableness, and excellency, that I wondered I should ever think of any other way of salvation; wasamazed that I had not dropped my own contrivances, and complied with this lovely, blessed, and excellent way before. If I could havebeen saved by my own duties or any other way that I had formerly contrived, my whole soul would now have refused it. I wondered thatall the world did not see and comply with this way of salvation, entirely by the righteousness of Christ.\"1I have italicized the passage which records the exhaustion of the anxious emotion hitherto habitual. In a largeproportion, perhaps the majority, of reports, the writers speak as if the exhaustion of the lower and the entrance of thehigher emotion were simultaneous,2 yet often again they speak as if the higher actively drove the lower out. This isundoubtedly true in a great many instances, as we shall presently see. But often there seems little doubt that bothconditions—subconscious ripening of the one affection and exhaustion of the other—must simultaneously haveconspired, in order to produce the result.T. W. B., a convert of Nettleton's, being brought to an acute paroxysm of conviction of sin, ate nothing all day, locked himself in hisroom in the evening in complete despair, crying aloud, \"How long, O Lord, how long?\"1EDWARDS'S and DWIGHT'S Life of Brainerd, New Haven, 1822, pp. 45 47, abridged.2Describing the whole phenomenon as a change of equilibrium, we might say that the movement of new psychic energies towards thepersonal centre and the recession of old ones towards the margin (or the rising of some objects above, and the sinking of others below theconscious threshold) were only two ways of describing an indivisible event. Doubtless this is often absolutely true, and Starbuck is rightwhen he says that 'self-surrender' and 'new determination,' though seeming at first sight to be such different experiences, are \"really the samething. Self-surrender sees the change in terms of the old self; determination sees it in terms of the new.\" Op. cit., p. 160."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/Dl /lib// ldP200 hl[27 02 2011 00 35 02]Page 200\"After repeating this and similar language,\" he says, \"several times, I seemed to sink away into a state of insensibility. When I came tomyself again I was on my knees, praying not for myself but for others. I felt submission to the will of God, willing that he should dowith me as should seem good in his sight. My concern seemed all lost in concern for others.\"1Our great American revivalist Finney writes: \"I said to myself: 'What is this? I must have grieved the Holy Ghost entirely away. I havelost all my conviction. I have not a particle of concern about my soul; and it must be that the Spirit has left me.' 'Why!' thought I, 'I neverwas so far from being concerned about my own salvation in my life.' I tried to recall my convictions, to get back again the load of sinunder which I had been laboring. I tried in vain to make myself anxious. I was so quiet and peaceful that I tried to feel concerned aboutthat, lest it should be the result of my having grieved the Spirit away.\"2But beyond all question there are persons in whom, quite independently of any exhaustion in the Subject's capacity forfeeling, or even in the absence of any acute previous feeling, the higher condition, having reached the due degree ofenergy, bursts through all barriers and sweeps in like a sudden flood. These are the most striking and memorablecases, the cases of instantaneous conversion to which the conception of divine grace has been most peculiarlyattached. I have given one of them at length—the case of Mr. Bradley. But I had better reserve the other cases and mycomments on the rest of the subject for the following lecture.1A. A. BONAR: Nettleton and his Labors, Edinburgh, 1854, p. 261.2CHARLES G.

Conversionof this type is an important phase of religious experience, owing to the part which it has played in Protestant theology,and it behooves us to study it conscientiously on that account.I think I had better cite two or three of these cases before proceeding to a more generalized account. One must knowconcrete instances first; for, as Professor Agassiz used to say, one can see no farther into a generalization than just sofar as one's previous acquaintance with particulars enables one to take it in. I will go back, then, to the case of ourfriend Henry Alline, and quote his report of the 26th of March, 1775, on which his poor divided mind became unifiedfor good.\"As I was about sunset wandering in the fields lamenting my miserable lost and undone condition, and almost ready to sink under myburden, I thought I was in such a miserable case as never any man was before. I returned to the house, and when I got to the door, just asI was stepping off the threshold, the following impressions came into my mind like a powerful but small still voice. You have beenseeking, praying, reforming, laboring, reading, hearing, and meditating, and what have you done by it towards your salvation? Are youany nearer to conversion now than when you first began? Are you any more prepared for heaven, or fitter to appear before the impartialbar of God, than when you first began to seek?\"It brought such conviction on me that I was obliged to say that I did not think I was one step nearer than at first, but as muchcondemned, as much exposed, and as miser-"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP202 hl[01 03 2011 00 25 57]Page 202able as before. I cried out within myself, O Lord God, I am lost, and if thou, O Lord, dost not find out some new way, I know nothing of,I shall never be saved, for the ways and methods I have prescribed to myself have all failed me, and I am willing they should fail. OLord, have mercy! O Lord, have mercy!\"These discoveries continued until I went into the house and sat down. After I sat down, being all in confusion, like a drowning man thatwas just giving up to sink, and almost in an agony, I turned very suddenly round in my chair, and seeing part of an old Bible lying in oneof the chairs, I caught hold of it in great haste; and opening it without any premeditation, cast my eyes on the 38th Psalm, which was thefirst time I ever saw the word of God: it took hold of me with such power that it seemed to go through my whole soul, so that it seemedas if God was praying in, with, and for me. About this time my father called the family to attend prayers; I attended, but paid no regardto what he said in his prayer, but continued praying in those words of the Psalm. Oh, help me, help me! cried I, thou Redeemer of souls,and save me, or I am gone forever; thou canst this night, if thou pleasest, with one drop of thy blood atone for my sins, and appease thewrath of an angry God. At that instant of time when I gave all up to him to do with me as he pleased, and was willing that God shouldrule over me at his pleasure, redeeming love broke into my soul with repeated scriptures, with such power that my whole soul seemed tobe melted down with love; the burden of guilt and condemnation was gone, darkness was expelled, my heart humbled and filled withgratitude, and my whole soul, that was a few minutes ago groaning under mountains of death, and crying to an unknown God for help,was now filled with immortal love, soaring on the wings of faith, freed from the chains of death and darkness, and crying out, My Lordand my God; thou art my rock and my fortress, my shield and my high tower, my life, my joy, my present and my everlasting portion.Looking up, I thought I saw that same light [he had on more than one previous occasion seen subjectively a bright blaze of light], thoughit appeared different; and as soon as I saw it, the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP203 hl[01 03 2011 00 25 58]Page 203design was opened to me, according to his promise, and I was obliged to cry out: Enough, enough, O blessed God! The work ofconversion, the change, and the manifestations of it are no more disputable than that light which I see, or anything that ever I saw.\"In the midst of all my joys, in less than half an hour after my soul was set at liberty, the Lord discovered to me my labor in the ministryand call to preach the gospel. I cried out, Amen, Lord, I'll go; send me, send me. I spent the greatest part of the night in ecstasies of joy,praising and adoring the Ancient of Days for his free and unbounded grace. After I had been so long in this transport and heavenly framethat my nature seemed to require sleep, I thought to close my eyes for a few moments; then the devil stepped in, and told me that if Iwent to sleep, I should lose it all, and when I should awake in the morning I would find it to be nothing but a fancy and delusion. Iimmediately cried out, O Lord God, if I am deceived, undeceive me.\"I then closed my eyes for a few minutes, and seemed to be refreshed with sleep; and when I awoke, the first inquiry was, Where is myGod? And in an instant of time, my soul seemed awake in and with God, and surrounded by the arms of everlasting love. About sunrise Iarose with joy to relate to my parents what God had done for my soul, and declared to them the miracle of God's unbounded grace. I tooka Bible to show them the words that were impressed by God on my soul the evening before; but when I came to open the Bible, itappeared all new to me.\"I so longed to be useful in the cause of Christ, in preaching the gospel, that it seemed as if I could not rest any longer, but go I must andtell the wonders of redeeming love. I lost all taste for carnal pleasures, and carnal company, and was enabled to forsake them.\"1Young Mr. Alline, after the briefest of delays, and with no book-learning but his Bible, and no teaching save that ofhis own experience, became a Christian minister, and thence-forward his life was fit to rank, for its austerity andsingle-1Life and Journals, Boston, 1806, pp. 31 40, abridged."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP204 hl[01 03 2011 00 25 59]Page 204mindedness, with that of the most devoted saints. But happy as he became in his strenuous way, he never got his tastefor even the most innocent carnal pleasures back. We must class him, like Bunyan and Tolstoy, amongst those uponwhose soul the iron of melancholy left a permanent imprint. His redemption was into another universe than this merenatural world, and life remained for him a sad and patient trial. Years later we can find him making such an entry asthis in his diary: ''On Wednesday the 12th I preached at a wedding, and had the happiness thereby to be the means ofexcluding carnal mirth.\"The next case I will give is that of a correspondent of Professor Leuba, printed in the latter's article, already cited, invol. vii. of the American Journal of Psychology. This subject was an Oxford graduate, the son of a clergyman, and thestory resembles in many points the classic case of Colonel Gardiner, which everybody may be supposed to know.Here it is, somewhat abridged:—\"Between the period of leaving Oxford and my conversion I never darkened the door of my father's church, although I lived with him foreight years, making what money I wanted by journalism, and spending it in high carousal with any one who would sit with me and drinkit away. So I lived, sometimes drunk for a week together, and then a terrible repentance, and would not touch a drop for a whole month.\"In all this period, that is, up to thirty-three years of age, I never had a desire to reform on religious grounds. But all my pangs were dueto some terrible remorse I used to feel after a heavy carousal, the remorse taking the shape of regret after my folly in wasting my life insuch a way—a man of superior talents and education. This terrible remorse turned me gray in one night, and whenever it came upon me Iwas perceptibly grayer the next morning. What I suffered in this way is beyond the expression of words. It was hell-fire in all its mostdreadful tortures. Often did I vow that if I got over 'this time' I would reform. Alas, in about three days I fully recovered, and was ashappy as ever. So it went on for years, but, with a physique like a rhinoceros,"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP205 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 00]Page 205I always recovered, and as long as I let drink alone, no man was as capable of enjoying life as I was.\"I was converted in my own bedroom in my father's rectory house at precisely three o'clock in the afternoon of a hot July day (July 13,1886). I was in perfect health, having been off from the drink for nearly a month. I was in no way troubled about my soul. In fact, Godwas not in my thoughts that day. A young lady friend sent me a copy of Professor Drummond's Natural Law in the Spiritual World,asking me my opinion of it as a literary work only. Being proud of my critical talents and wishing to enhance myself in my new friend'sesteem, I took the book to my bedroom for quiet, intending to give it a thorough study, and then write her what I thought of it. It washere that God met me face to face, and I shall never forget the meeting. 'He that hath the Son hath life eternal; he that hath not the Sonhath not life.' I had read this scores of times before, but this made all the difference. I was now in God's presence and my attention wasabsolutely 'soldered' on to this verse, and I was not allowed to proceed with the book till I had fairly considered what these words reallyinvolved. Only then was I allowed to proceed, feeling all the while that there was another being in my bedroom, though not seen by me.The stillness was very marvelous, and I felt supremely happy. It was most unquestionably shown me, in one second of time, that I hadnever touched the Eternal: and that if I died then, I must inevitably be lost. I was undone. I knew it as well as I now know I am saved.The Spirit of God showed it me in ineffable love; there was no terror in it; I felt God's love so powerfully upon me that only a mightysorrow crept over me that I had lost all through my own folly; and what was I to do? What could I do? I did not repent even; God neverasked me to repent. All I felt was 'I am undone,' and God cannot help it, although he loves me. No fault on the part of the Almighty. Allthe time I was supremely happy: I felt like a little child before his father. I had done wrong, but my Father did not scold me, but lovedme most wondrously. Still my doom was sealed. I was lost to a certainty, and being naturally of a brave"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP206 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 02]Page 206disposition I did not quail under it, but deep sorrow for the past, mixed with regret for what I had lost, took hold upon me, and my soulthrilled within me to think it was all over. Then there crept in upon me so gently, so lovingly, so unmistakably, a way of escape, and whatwas it after all? The old, old story over again, told in the simplest way: 'There is no name under heaven whereby ye can be saved exceptthat of the Lord Jesus Christ.' No words were spoken to me; my soul seemed to see my Saviour in the spirit, and from that hour to this,nearly nine years now, there has never been in my life one doubt that the Lord Jesus Christ and God the Father both worked upon me thatafternoon in July, both differently, and both in the most perfect love conceivable, and I rejoiced there and then in a conversion soastounding that the whole village heard of it in less than twenty-four hours.\"But a time of trouble was yet to come. The day after my conversion I went into the hay-field to lend a hand with the harvest, and nothaving made any promise to God to abstain or drink in moderation only, I took too much and came home drunk. My poor sister washeartbroken; and I felt ashamed of myself and got to my bedroom at once, where she followed me, weeping copiously. She said I hadbeen converted and fallen away instantly. But although I was quite full of drink (not muddled, however), I knew that God's work begunin me was not going to be wasted. About midday I made on my knees the first prayer before God for twenty years. I did not ask to beforgiven; I felt that was no good, for I would be sure to fall again. Well, what did I do? I committed myself to him in the profoundestbelief that my individuality was going to be destroyed, that he would take all from me, and I was willing. In such a surrender lies thesecret of a holy life. From that hour drink has had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never want it.

He gets a free hand in other ways, but never on sins of the flesh. Since I gave up to God all ownership inmy own life, he has guided me in a thousand ways, and has opened my path in a way almost incredible to those who do not enjoy theblessing of a truly surrendered life.\"So much for our graduate of Oxford, in whom you notice the complete abolition of an ancient appetite as one of theconversion's fruits.The most curious record of sudden conversion with which I am acquainted is that of M. Alphonse Ratisbonne, a free-thinking French Jew, to Catholicism, at Rome in 1842. In a letter to a clerical friend, written a few months later, theconvert gives a palpitating account of the circumstances.1 The predisposing conditions appear to have been slight. Hehad an elder brother who had been converted and was a Catholic priest. He was himself irreligious, and nourished anantipathy to the apostate brother and generally to his 'cloth.' Finding himself at Rome in his twenty-ninth year, he fellin with a French gentleman who tried to make a proselyte of him, but who succeeded no farther after two or threeconversations than to get him to hang (half jocosely) a religious medal round his neck, and to accept and read a copyof a short prayer to the Virgin. M. Ratisbonne represents his own part in the conversations as having been of a lightand chaffing order; but he notes the fact that for some days he was unable to banish the words of the prayer from hismind, and that the night before the crisis he had a sort of nightmare, in the imagery of which a black cross with noChrist upon it figured. Nevertheless, until noon of the next day he was free in mind and spent the time in trivialconversations. I now give his own words.\"If at this time any one had accosted me, saying: 'Alphonse, in a quarter of an hour you shall be adoring Jesus Christ as your God andSaviour; you shall lie prostrate with1My quotations are made from an Italian translation of this letter in the Biografia del Sig.

And yet that folly is at present my onlywisdom, my sole happiness.\"Coming out of the café I met the carriage of Monsieur B. [the proselyting friend]. He stopped and invited me in for a drive, but firstasked me to wait for a few minutes whilst he attended to some duty at the church of San Andrea delle Fratte. Instead of waiting in thecarriage, I entered the church myself to look at it. The church of San Andrea was poor, small, and empty; I believe that I found myselfthere almost alone. No work of art attracted my attention; and I passed my eyes mechanically over its interior without being arrested byany particular thought. I can only remember an entirely black dog which went trotting and turning before me as I mused. In an instant thedog had disappeared, the whole church had vanished, I no longer saw anything, or more truly I saw, O my God, one thing alone.\"Heavens, how can I speak of it? Oh no! human words cannot attain to expressing the inexpressible. Any description, however sublime itmight be, could be but a profanation of the unspeakable truth.\"I was there prostrate on the ground, bathed in my tears, with my heart beside itself, when M.

Oh, indeed, it was She! It was indeed She! [What he had seen had been a vision of the Virgin.]\"I did not know where I was: I did not know whether I was Alphonse or another. I only felt myself changed and believed myself anotherme; I looked for myself in myself and did not find myself. In the bottom of my soul I felt an explosion of the most ardent joy; I could notspeak; I had no wish to reveal what had happened. But I felt something solemn and sacred within me which made me ask for a priest. Iwas led to one; and there, alone, after he had given me the positive order, I spoke as best I could, kneeling, and with my heart stilltrembling. I could give no account to myself of the truth of which I had acquired a knowledge and a faith. All that I can say is that in aninstant the bandage had fallen from my eyes; and not one bandage only, but the whole manifold of bandages in which I had been broughtup. One after another they rapidly disappeared, even as the mud and ice disappear under the rays of the burning sun.\"I came out as from a sepulchre, from an abyss of darkness; and I was living, perfectly living. But I wept, for at the bottom of that gulf Isaw the extreme of misery from which I had been saved by an infinite mercy; and I shuddered at the sight of my iniquities, stupefied,melted, overwhelmed with wonder and with gratitude. You may ask me how I came to this new insight, for truly I had never opened abook of religion nor even read a single page of the Bible, and the dogma of original sin is either entirely denied or forgotten by theHebrews of to-day, so that I had thought so little about it that I doubt whether I ever knew its name. But how came I, then, to thisperception of it? I can answer nothing save this, that on entering that church I was in darkness altogether, and on coming out of it I sawthe fullness of the light. I can explain the change no better than by the simile of a profound sleep or the analogy of one born blind whoshould suddenly open his eyes to the day. He sees, but cannot define the light which bathes him and by means of which he sees theobjects which excite his wonder.

And I think I remain within the limits of veracity when I say that without having any knowledge of the letter of religious doctrine,I now intuitively perceived its sense and spirit. Better than if I saw them, I felt those hidden things; I felt them by the inexplicable effectsthey produced in me. It all happened in my interior mind; and those impressions, more rapid than thought, shook my soul, revolved andturned it, as it were, in another direction, towards other aims, by other paths. I express myself badly. But do you wish, Lord, that I shouldinclose in poor and barren words sentiments which the heart alone can understand?\"I might multiply cases almost indefinitely, but these will suffice to show you how real, definite, and memorable anevent a sudden conversion may be to him who has the experience. Throughout the height of it he undoubtedly seemsto himself a passive spectator or undergoer of an astounding process performed upon him from above. There is toomuch evidence of this for any doubt of it to be possible. Theology, combining this fact with the doctrines of electionand grace, has concluded that the spirit of God is with us at these dramatic moments in a peculiarly miraculous way,unlike what happens at any other juncture of our lives. At that moment, it believes, an absolutely new nature isbreathed into us, and we become partakers of the very substance of the Deity.That the conversion should be instantaneous seems called for on this view, and the Moravian Protestants appear tohave been the first to see this logical consequence. The Methodists soon followed suit, practically if not dogmatically,and a short time ere his death, John Wesley wrote:—\"In London alone I found 652 members of our Society who were exceeding clear in their experience, and whose testimony I could see noreason to doubt. And every one of these (without a single exception) has declared that his deliverance from sin was instantaneous; thatthe change was wrought in a moment. Had half of these, or one third, or one in twenty, declared it was gradually wrought in them, Ishould have believed this, with regard to them, and thought that some were gradually sanctified and some in-"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP211 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 08]Page 211stantaneously. But as I have not found, in so long a space of time, a single person speaking thus, I cannot but believe that sanctification iscommonly, if not always, an instantaneous work.\" Tyerman's Life of Wesley, i. 463.All this while the more usual sects of Protestantism have set no such store by instantaneous conversion. For them asfor the Catholic Church, Christ's blood, the sacraments, and the individual's ordinary religious duties are practicallysupposed to suffice to his salvation, even though no acute crisis of self-despair and surrender followed by relief shouldbe experienced. For Methodism, on the contrary, unless there have been a crisis of this sort, salvation is only offered,not effectively received, and Christ's sacrifice in so far forth is incomplete. Methodism surely here follows, if not thehealthier-minded, yet on the whole the profounder spiritual instinct. The individual models which it has set up astypical and worthy of imitation are not only the more interesting dramatically, but psychologically they have been themore complete.In the fully evolved Revivalism of Great Britain and America we have, so to speak, the codified and stereotypedprocedure to which this way of thinking has led. In spite of the unquestionable fact that saints of the once-born typeexist, that there may be a gradual growth in holiness without a cataclysm; in spite of the obvious leakage (as one maysay) of much mere natural goodness into the scheme of salvation; revivalism has always assumed that only its owntype of religious experience can be perfect; you must first be nailed on the cross of natural despair and agony, andthen in the twinkling of an eye be miraculously released.It is natural that those who personally have traversed such an experience should carry away a feeling of its being amiracle rather than a natural process. Voices are often heard, lights seen, or visions witnessed; automatic motorphenomena occur; and it always seems, after the surrender of the personal will, as if an extraneous higher power hadflooded in and taken possession. Moreover the sense of renovation, safety, cleanness, rightness, can be so marvelousand jubilant as well to warrant one's belief in a radically new substantial nature."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP212 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 09]Page 212\"Conversion,\" writes the New England Puritan, Joseph Alleine, \"is not the putting in a patch of holiness; but with thetrue convert holiness is woven into all his powers, principles, and practice. The sincere Christian is quite a new fabric,from the foundation to the top-stone. He is a new man, a new creature.\"And Jonathan Edwards says in the same strain: \"Those gracious influences which are the effects of the Spirit of Godare altogether supernatural—are quite different from anything that unregenerate men experience. They are what noimprovement, or composition of natural qualifications or principles will ever produce; because they not only differfrom what is natural, and from everything that natural men experience in degree and circumstances, but also in kind,and are of a nature far more excellent. From hence it follows that in gracious affections there are [also] newperceptions and sensations entirely different in their nature and kind from anything experienced by the [same] saintsbefore they were sanctified. The conceptions which the saints have of the loveliness of God, and that kind of delightwhich they experience in it, are quite peculiar, and entirely different from anything which a natural man can possess,or of which he can form any proper notion.\"And that such a glorious transformation as this ought of necessity to be preceded by despair is shown by Edwards inanother passage.\"Surely it cannot be unreasonable,\" he says, \"that before God delivers us from a state of sin and liability to everlasting woe, he shouldgive us some considerable sense of the evil from which he delivers us, in order that we may know and feel the importance of salvation,and be enabled to appreciate the value of what God is pleased to do for us. As those who are saved are successively in two extremelydifferent states—first in a state of condemnation and then in a state of justification and blessedness—and as God, in the salvation of men,deals with them as rational and intelligent creatures, it appears agreeable to this wisdom, that those who are saved should be madesensible of their Being, in those two different states.

Whatever partsuggestion and imitation may have played in producing them in men and women in excited assemblies, they have atany rate been in countless individual instances an original and unborrowed experience. Were we writing the story ofthe mind from the purely natural-history point of view, with no religious interest whatever, we should still have towrite down man's liability to sudden and complete conversion as one of his most curious peculiarities.What, now, must we ourselves think of this question? Is an instantaneous conversion a miracle in which God ispresent as he is present in no change of heart less strikingly abrupt? Are there two classes of human beings, evenamong the apparently regenerate, of which the one class really partakes of Christ's nature while the other merelyseems to do so? Or, on the contrary, may the whole phenomenon of regeneration, even in these startling instantaneousexamples, possibly be a strictly natural process, divine in its fruits, of course, but in one case more and in another lessso, and neither more nor less divine in its mere causation and mechanism than any other process, high or low, of man'sinterior life?Before proceeding to answer this question, I must ask you to listen to some more psychological remarks. At our lastlecture, I explained the shifting of men's centres of personal energy within them and the lighting up of new crises ofemotion. I explained the phenomena as partly due to explicitly conscious processes of thought and will, but as duelargely also to the subconscious incubation and maturing of motives deposited by the experiences of life. When ripe,the results hatch out, or burst into flower. I have now to speak of the subconscious region, in which such processes offlowering may occur, in a somewhat less vague way. I only regret that my limits of time here force me to be so short.The expression 'field of consciousness' has but recently"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP214 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 12]Page 214come into vogue in the psychology books. Until quite lately the unit of mental life which figured most was the single'idea,' supposed to be a definitely outlined thing. But at present psychologists are tending, first, to admit that the actualunit is more probably the total mental state, the entire wave of consciousness or field of objects present to the thoughtat any time; and, second, to see that it is impossible to outline this wave, this field, with any definiteness.As our mental fields succeed one another, each has its centre of interest, around which the objects of which we areless and less attentively conscious fade to a margin so faint that its limits are unassignable. Some fields are narrowfields and some are wide fields. Usually when we have a wide field we rejoice, for we then see masses of truthtogether, and often get glimpses of relations which we divine rather than see, for they shoot beyond the field into stillremoter regions of objectivity, regions which we seem rather to be about to perceive than to perceive actually. Atother times, of drowsiness, illness, or fatigue, our fields may narrow almost to a point, and we find ourselvescorrespondingly oppressed and contracted.Different individuals present constitutional differences in this matter of width of field. Your great organizing geniusesare men with habitually vast fields of mental vision, in which a whole programme of future operations will appeardotted out at once, the rays shooting far ahead into definite directions of advance. In common people there is neverthis magnificent inclusive view of a topic. They stumble along, feeling their way, as it were, from point to point, andoften stop entirely. In certain diseased conditions consciousness is a mere spark, without memory of the past orthought of the future, and with the present narrowed down to some one simple emotion or sensation of the body.The important fact which this 'field' formula commemorates is the indetermination of the margin. Inattentivelyrealized as is the matter which the margin contains, it is nevertheless there, and helps both to guide our behavior andto determine the next movement of our attention. It lies around us like a 'magnetic field,' inside of which our centre ofenergy turns like a compass-needle, as the present phase of consciousness alters into its successor. Our whole paststore"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP215 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 13]Page 215of memories floats beyond this margin, ready at a touch to come in; and the entire mass of residual powers, impulses,and knowledges that constitute our empirical self stretches continuously beyond it. So vaguely drawn are the outlinesbetween what is actual and what is only potential at any moment of our conscious life, that it is always hard to say ofcertain mental elements whether we are conscious of them or not.The ordinary psychology, admitting fully the difficulty of tracing the marginal outline, has nevertheless taken forgranted, first, that all the consciousness the person now has, be the same focal or marginal, inattentive or attentive, isthere in the 'field' of the moment, all dim and impossible to assign as the latter's outline may be; and, second, thatwhat is absolutely extra-marginal is absolutely non-existent, and cannot be a fact of consciousness at all.And having reached this point, I must now ask you to recall what I said in my last lecture about the subconscious life.I said, as you may recollect, that those who first laid stress upon these phenomena could not know the facts as we nowknow them. My first duty now is to tell you what I meant by such a statement.I cannot but think that the most important step forward that has occurred in psychology since I have been a student ofthat science is the discovery, first made in 1886, that, in certain subjects at least, there is not only the consciousness ofthe ordinary field, with its usual centre and margin, but an addition thereto in the shape of a set of memories,thoughts, and feelings which are extra-marginal and outside of the primary consciousness altogether, but yet must beclassed as conscious facts of some sort, able to reveal their presence by unmistakable signs. I call this the mostimportant step forward because, unlike the other advances which psychology has made, this discovery has revealed tous an entirely unsuspected peculiarity in the constitution of human nature. No other step forward which psychologyhas made can proffer any such claim as this.In particular this discovery of a consciousness existing beyond the field, or subliminally as Mr. Myers terms it, castslight on many phenomena of religious biography. That is"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP216 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 14]Page 216why I have to advert to it now, although it is naturally impossible for me in this place to give you any account of theevidence on which the admission of such a consciousness is based. You will find it set forth in many recent books,Binet's Alterations of Personality1 being perhaps as good a one as any to recommend.The human material on which the demonstration has been made has so far been rather limited and, in part at least,eccentric, consisting of unusually suggestible hypnotic subjects, and of hysteric patients. Yet the elementarymechanisms of our life are presumably so uniform that what is shown to be true in a marked degree of some personsis probably true in some degree of all, and may in a few be true in an extraordinarily high degree.The most important consequence of having a strongly developed ultra-marginal life of this sort is that one's ordinaryfields of consciousness are liable to incursions from it of which the subject does not guess the source, and which,therefore, take for him the form of unaccountable impulses to act, or inhibitions of action, of obsessive ideas, or evenof hallucinations of sight or hearing. The impulses may take the direction of automatic speech or writing, the meaningof which the subject himself may not understand even while he utters it; and generalizing this phenomenon, Mr.Myers has given the name of automatism, sensory or motor, emotional or intellectual, to this whole sphere of effects,due to 'uprushes' into the ordinary consciousness of energies originating in the subliminal parts of the mind.The simplest instance of an automatism is the phenomenon of post-hypnotic suggestion, so-called. You give to ahypnotized subject, adequately susceptible, an order to perform some designated act—usual or eccentric, it makes nodifference—after he wakes from his hypnotic sleep. Punctually, when the signal comes or the time elapses upon whichyou have told him that the act must ensue, he performs it;—but in so doing he has no recollection of your suggestion,and he always trumps up an improvised pretext for his behavior if the act be of an eccentric kind. It may even besuggested to a1Published in the International Scientific Series."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP217 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 15]Page 217subject to have a vision or to hear a voice at a certain interval after waking, and when the time comes the vision isseen or the voice heard, with no inkling on the subject's part of its source. In the wonderful explorations by Binet,Janet, Breuer, Freud, Mason, Prince, and others, of the subliminal consciousness of patients with hysteria, we haverevealed to us whole systems of underground life, in the shape of memories of a painful sort which lead a parasiticexistence, buried outside of the primary fields of consciousness, and making irruptions thereinto with hallucinations,pains, convulsions, paralyses of feeling and of motion, and the whole procession of symptoms of hysteric disease ofbody and of mind. Alter or abolish by suggestion these subconscious memories, and the patient immediately gets well.His symptoms were automatisms, in Mr. Myers's sense of the word. These clinical records sound like fairy-tales whenone first reads them, yet it is impossible to doubt their accuracy; and, the path having been once opened by these firstobservers, similar observations have been made elsewhere. They throw, as I said, a wholly new light upon our naturalconstitution.And it seems to me that they make a farther step inevitable. Interpreting the unknown after the analogy of the known,it seems to me that hereafter, wherever we meet with a phenomenon of automatism, be it motor impulses, or obsessiveidea, or unaccountable caprice, or delusion, or hallucination, we are bound first of all to make search whether it be notan explosion, into the fields of ordinary consciousness, of ideas elaborated outside of those fields in subliminalregions of the mind. We should look, therefore, for its source in the Subject's subconscious life. In the hypnotic cases,we ourselves create the source by our suggestion, so we know it directly. In the hysteric cases, the lost memorieswhich are the source have to be extracted from the patient's Subliminal by a number of ingenious methods, for anaccount of which you must consult the books. In other pathological cases, insane delusions, for example, orpsychopathic obsessions, the source is yet to seek, but by analogy it also should be in subliminal regions whichimprovements in our methods may yet conceivably put on tap. There lies the mechanism logically to be assumed,—but the assumption involves a vast program of"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP218 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 22]Page 218work to be done in the way of verification, in which the religious experiences of man must play their part.1And thus I return to our own specific subject of instantaneous conversions. You remember the cases of Alline,Bradley, Brainerd, and the graduate of Oxford converted at three in the afternoon. Similar occurrences abound, somewith and some without luminous visions, all with a sense of astonished happiness, and of being wrought on by ahigher control. If, abstracting altogether from the question of their value for the future spiritual life of the individual,we take them on their psychological side exclusively, so many peculiarities in them remind us of what we find outsideof conversion that we are tempted to class them along with other automatisms, and to suspect that what makes thedifference between a sudden and a gradual convert is not necessarily the presence of divine1The reader will here please notice that in my exclusive reliance in the last lecture on the subconscious 'incubation' of motives depositedby a growing experience, I followed the method of employing accepted principles of explanation as far as one can. The subliminalregion, whatever else it may be, is at any rate a place now admitted by psychologists to exist for the accumulation of vestiges of sensibleexperience (whether inattentively or attentively registered), and for their elaboration according to ordinary psychological or logical lawsinto results that end by attaining such a 'tension' that they may at times enter consciousness with something like a burst. It thus is'scientific' to interpret all otherwise unaccountable invasive alterations of consciousness as results of the tension of subliminal memoriesreaching the bursting-point. But candor obliges me to confess that there are occasional bursts into consciousness of results of which it isnot easy to demonstrate any prolonged subconscious incubation. Some of the cases I used to illustrate the sense of presence of the unseenin Lecture III were of this order (compare pages 59, 62, 63, 67); and we shall see other experiences of the kind when we come to thesubject of mysticism. The case of Mr. Bradley, that of M. Ratisbonne, possibly that of Colonel Gardiner, possibly that of Saint Paul,might not be so easily explained in this simple way. The result, then, would have to be ascribed either to a merely physiological nervestorm, a 'discharging lesion' like that of epilepsy; or, in case it were useful and rational, as in the two latter cases named, to some moremystical or theological hypothesis. I make this remark in order that the reader may realize that the subject is really complex. But I shallkeep myself as far as possible at present to the more 'scientific' view; and only as the plot thickens in subsequent lectures shall I considerthe question of its absolute sufficiency as an explanation of all the facts. That subconscious incubation explains a great number of them,there can be no doubt."},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP219 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 34]Page 219miracle in the case of one and of something less divine in that of the other, but rather a simple psychologicalpeculiarity, the fact, namely, that in the recipient of the more instantaneous grace we have one of those Subjects whoare in possession of a large region in which mental work can go on subliminally, and from which invasiveexperiences, abruptly upsetting the equilibrium of the primary consciousness, may come.I do not see why Methodists need object to such a view. Pray go back and recollect one of the conclusions to which Isought to lead you in my very first lecture. You may remember how I there argued against the notion that the worth ofa thing can be decided by its origin. Our spiritual judgment, I said, our opinion of the significance and value of ahuman event or condition, must be decided on empirical grounds exclusively. If the fruits for life of the state ofconversion are good, we ought to idealize and venerate it, even though it be a piece of natural psychology; if not, weought to make short work with it, no matter what supernatural being may have infused it.Well, how is it with these fruits? If we except the class of preëminent saints of whom the names illumine history, andconsider only the usual run of 'saints,' the shopkeeping church-members and ordinary youthful or middle-agedrecipients of instantaneous conversion, whether at revivals or in the spontaneous course of methodistic growth, youwill probably agree that no splendor worthy of a wholly supernatural creature fulgurates from them, or sets them apartfrom the mortals who have never experienced that favor. Were it true that a suddenly converted man as such is, asEdwards says,1 of an entirely different kind from a natural man, partaking as he does directly of Christ's substance,there surely ought to be some exquisite class-mark, some distinctive radiance attaching even to the lowliest specimenof this genus, to which no one of us could remain insensible, and which, so far as it went, would prove him moreexcellent than ever the most highly gifted among mere natural men. But notoriously there1Edwards says elsewhere: ''I am bold to say that the work of God in the conversion of one soul, considered together with the source,foundation, and purchase of it, and also the benefit, end, and eternal issue of it, is a more glorious work of God than the creation of thewhole material universe.\""},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP220 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 35]Page 220is no such radiance. Converted men as a class are indistinguishable from natural men; some natural men even excelsome converted men in their fruits; and no one ignorant of doctrinal theology could guess by mere every-dayinspection of the 'accidents' of the two groups of persons before him, that their substance differed as much as divinediffers from human substance.The believers in the non-natural character of sudden conversion have had practically to admit that there is nounmistakable class-mark distinctive of all true converts. The super-normal incidents, such as voices and visions andover-powering impressions of the meaning of suddenly presented scripture texts, the melting emotions and tumultuousaffections connected with the crisis of change, may all come by way of nature, or worse still, be counterfeited bySatan. The real witness of the spirit to the second birth is to be found only in the disposition of the genuine child ofGod, the permanently patient heart, the love of self eradicated. And this, it has to be admitted, is also found in thosewho pass no crisis, and may even be found outside of Christianity altogether.Throughout Jonathan Edward's admirably rich and delicate description of the supernaturally infused condition, in hisTreatise on Religious Affections, there is not one decisive trait, not one mark, that unmistakably parts it off from whatmay possibly be only an exceptionally high degree of natural goodness. In fact, one could hardly read a clearerargument than this book unwittingly offers in favor of the thesis that no chasm exists between the orders of humanexcellence, but that here as elsewhere, nature shows continuous differences, and generation and regeneration arematters of degree.All which denial of two objective classes of human beings separated by a chasm must not leave us blind to theextraordinary momentousness of the fact of his conversion to the individual himself who gets converted. There arehigher and lower limits of possibility set to each personal life. If a flood but goes above one's head, its absoluteelevation becomes a matter of small importance; and when we touch our own upper limit and live in our own highestcentre of energy, we may call ourselves saved, no matter how much higher some one else's centre may be. A smallman's salvation will always"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP221 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 36]Page 221be a great salvation and the greatest of all facts for him, and we should remember this when the fruits of our ordinaryevangelicism look discouraging. Who knows how much less ideal still the lives of these spiritual grubs andearthworms, these Crumps and Stigginses, might have been, if such poor grace as they have received had nevertouched them at all?1If we roughly arrange human beings in classes, each class standing for a grade of spiritual excellence, I believe weshall find natural men and converts both sudden and gradual in all the classes. The forms which regenerative changeeffects have, then, no general spiritual significance, but only a psychological significance. We have seen howStarbuck's laborious statistical studies tend to assimilate conversion to ordinary spiritual growth. Another Americanpsychologist, Professor George A. Coe,2 has analyzed the cases of seventy-seven converts or ex-candidates forconversion, known to him, and the results strikingly confirm the view that sudden conversion is connected with thepossession of an active subliminal self. Examining his subjects with reference to their hypnotic sensibility and to suchautomatisms as hypnagogic hallucinations, odd impulses, religious dreams about the time of their conversion, etc., hefound these relatively much more frequent in the group of converts whose transformation had been 'striking,' 'striking'transformation being defined as a \"change which, though not necessarily instantaneous, seems to the subject of it tobe distinctly different from a process of growth, however rapid.\"3 Candidates for conversion at revivals are, as youknow, often disappointed: they experience nothing striking. Professor Coe had a number of persons of this classamong his seventy-seven subjects,1Emerson writes: \"When we see a soul whose acts are regal, graceful, and pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such thing's can beand are, and not turn sourly on the angel and say: Crump is a better man, with his grunting resistance to all his native devils.\" Trueenough. Yet Crump may really be the better Crump, for his inner discords and second birth; and your once-born 'regal' character, thoughindeed always better than poor Crump, may fall far short of what he individually might be had he only some Crump-like capacity forcompunction over his own peculiar diabolisms, graceful and pleasant and invariably gentlemanly as these may be.2In his book, The Spiritual Life, New York, 1900.3Op. cit., p. 112."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP222 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 38]Page 222and they almost all, when tested by hypnotism, proved to belong to a subclass which he calls 'spontaneous,' that is,fertile in self-suggestions, as distinguished from a 'passive' subclass, to which most of the subjects of strikingtransformation belonged. His inference is that self-suggestion of impossibility had prevented the influence upon thesepersons of an environment which, on the more 'passive' subjects, had easily brought forth the effects they looked for.Sharp distinctions are difficult in these regions, and Professor Coe's numbers are small. But his methods were careful,and the results tally with what one might expect; and they seem, on the whole, to justify his practical conclusion,which is that if you should expose to a converting influence a subject in whom three factors unite: first, pronouncedemotional sensibility; second, tendency to automatisms; and third, suggestibility of the passive type; you might thensafely predict the result: there would be a sudden conversion, a transformation of the striking kind.Does this temperamental origin diminish the significance of the sudden conversion when it has occurred? Not in theleast, as Professor Coe well says; for \"the ultimate test of religious values is nothing psychological, nothing definablein terms of how it happens, but something ethical, definable only in terms of what is attained.\"1As we proceed farther in our inquiry we shall see that what is attained is often an altogether new level of spiritualvitality, a relatively heroic level, in which impossible things have become possible, and new energies and endurancesare shown. The personality is changed, the man is born anew, whether or not his psychological idiosyncrasies are whatgive the particular shape to his metamorphosis. 'Sanctification' is the technical name of this result; and erelongexamples of it shall be brought before you. In this lecture I have still only to add a few remarks on the assurance andpeace which fill the hour of change itself.One word more, though, before proceeding to that point, lest the final purpose of my explanation of suddenness bysub-1Op. cit., p. 144."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP223 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 39]Page 223liminal activity be misunderstood. I do indeed believe that if the Subject have no liability to such subconsciousactivity, or if his conscious fields have a hard rind of a margin that resists incursions from beyond it, his conversionmust be gradual if it occur, and must resemble any simple growth into new habits. His possession of a developedsubliminal self, and of a leaky or pervious margin, is thus a conditio sine qua non of the Subject's becomingconverted in the instantaneous way. But if you, being orthodox Christians, ask me as a psychologist whether thereference of a phenomenon to a subliminal self does not exclude the notion of the direct presence of the Deityaltogether, I have to say frankly that as a psychologist I do not see why it necessarily should. The lowermanifestations of the Subliminal, indeed, fall within the resources of the personal subject: his ordinary sense-material,inattentively taken in and subconsciously remembered and combined, will account for all his usual automatisms. Butjust as our primary wide-awake consciousness throws open our senses to the touch of things material, so it is logicallyconceivable that if there be higher spiritual agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological condition of theirdoing so might be our possession of a subconscious region which alone should yield access to them. The hubbub ofthe waking life might close a door which in the dreamy Subliminal might remain ajar or open.Thus that perception of external control which is so essential a feature in conversion might, in some cases at any rate,be interpreted as the orthodox interpret it: forces transcending the finite individual might impress him, on condition ofhis being what we may call a subliminal human specimen. But in any case the value of these forces would have to bedetermined by their effects, and the mere fact of their transcendency would of itself establish no presumption that theywere more divine than diabolical.I confess that this is the way in which I should rather see the topic left lying in your minds until I come to a muchlater lecture, when I hope once more to gather these dropped threads together into more definitive conclusions. Thenotion of a subconscious self certainly ought not at this point of our inquiry to be held to exclude all notion of ahigher pene-"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP224 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 41]Page 224tration. If there be higher powers able to impress us, they may get access to us only through the subliminal door. (Seebelow, p. 460 ff.)Let us turn now to the feelings which immediately fill the hour of the conversion experience. The first one to be notedis just this sense of higher control. It is not always, but it is very often present. We saw examples of it in Alline,Bradley, Brainerd, and elsewhere. The need of such a higher controlling agency is well expressed in the shortreference which the eminent French Protestant Adolphe Monod makes to the crisis of his own conversion. It was atNaples in his early manhood, in the summer of 1827.\"My sadness,\" he says, \"was without limit, and having got entire possession of me, it filled my life from the most indifferent external actsto the most secret thoughts, and corrupted at their source my feelings, my judgment, and my happiness. It was then that I saw that toexpect to put a stop to this disorder by my reason and my will, which were themselves diseased, would be to act like a blind man whoshould pretend to correct one of his eyes by the aid of the other equally blind one. I had then no resource save in some influence fromwithout. I remembered the promise of the Holy Ghost; and what the positive declarations of the Gospel had never succeeded in bringinghome to me, I learned at last from necessity, and believed, for the first time in my life, in this promise, in the only sense in which itanswered the needs of my soul, in that, namely, of a real external supernatural action, capable of giving me thoughts, and taking themaway from me, and exerted on me by a God as truly master of my heart as he is of the rest of nature. Renouncing then all merit, allstrength, abandoning all my personal resources, and acknowledging no other title to his mercy than my own utter misery, I went homeand threw myself on my knees, and prayed as I never yet prayed in my life. From this day onwards a new interior life began for me: notthat my melancholy had disappeared, but it had lost its sting. Hope had entered into my heart, and once entered on the path, the God ofJesus Christ, to"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP225 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 44]Page 225whom I then had learned to give myself up, little by little did the rest.\"1It is needless to remind you once more of the admirable congruity of Protestant theology with the structure of the mindas shown in such experiences. In the extreme of melancholy the self that consciously is can do absolutely nothing. It iscompletely bankrupt and without resource, and no works it can accomplish will avail. Redemption from suchsubjective conditions must be a free gift or nothing, and grace through Christ's accomplished sacrifice is such a gift.\"God,\" says Luther, \"is the God of the humble, the miserable, the oppressed, and the desperate, and of those that are brought even tonothing; and his nature is to give sight to the blind, to comfort the broken-hearted, to justify sinners, to save the very desperate anddamned. Now that pernicious and pestilent opinion of man's own righteousness, which will not be a sinner, unclean, miserable, anddamnable, but righteous and holy, suffereth not God to come to his own natural and proper work. Therefore God must take this maul inhand (the law, I mean) to beat in pieces and bring to nothing this beast with her vain confidence, that she may so learn at length by herown misery that she is utterly forlorn and damned. But here lieth the difficulty, that when a man is terrified and cast down, he is so littleable to raise himself up again and say, 'Now I am bruised and afflicted enough; now is the time of grace; now is the time to hear Christ.'The foolishness of man's heart is so great that then he rather seeketh to himself more laws to satisfy his conscience. 'If I live,' saith he, 'Iwill amend my life: I will do this, I will do that.' But here, except thou do the quite contrary, except thou send Moses away with his law,and in these terrors and this anguish lay hold upon Christ who died for thy sins, look for no salvation. Thy cowl, thy shaven crown, thychastity, thy obedience, thy poverty, thy works, thy merits? what shall all these do? what shall the1I piece together a quotation made by W. Monod, in his book la Vie, and a letter printed in the work: Adolphe Monod: I., Souvenirs desa Vie, 1885, p. 433."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP226 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 45]Page 226law of Moses avail? If I, wretched and damnable sinner, through works or merits could have loved the Son of God, and so come to him,what needed he to deliver himself for me? If I, being a wretch and damned sinner, could be redeemed by any other price, what neededthe Son of God to be given? But because there was no other price, therefore he delivered neither sheep, ox, gold, nor silver, but evenGod himself, entirely and wholly 'for me,' even 'for me,' I say, a miserable, wretched sinner. Now, therefore, I take comfort and applythis to myself. And this manner of applying is the very true force and power of faith. For he died not to justify the righteous, but the un-righteous, and to make them the children of God.\"1That is, the more literally lost you are, the more literally you are the very being whom Christ's sacrifice has alreadysaved. Nothing in Catholic theology, I imagine, has ever spoken to sick souls as straight as this message from Luther'spersonal experience. As Protestants are not all sick souls, of course reliance on what Luther exults in calling the dungof one's merits, the filthy puddle of one's own righteousness, has come to the front again in their religion; but theadequacy of his view of Christianity to the deeper parts of our human mental structure is shown by its wildfirecontagiousness when it was a new and quickening thing.Faith that Christ has genuinely done his work was part of what Luther meant by faith, which so far is faith in a factintellectually conceived of. But this is only one part of Luther's faith, the other part being far more vital. This otherpart is something not intellectual but immediate and intuitive, the assurance, namely, that I, this individual I, just as Istand, without one plea, etc., am saved now and forever.21Commentary on Galatians, ch. iii. verse 19, and ch. ii. verse 20, abridged.2In some conversions, both steps are distinct; in this one, for example:—\"Whilst I was reading the evangelical treatise, I was soon struck by an expression: 'the finished work of Christ.' 'Why,' I asked of myself,'does the author use these terms? Why does he not say \"the atoning work\" ?' Then these words, 'It is finished,' presented themselves to mymind. 'What is it that is finished?' I asked, and in an instant my mind replied: 'A perfect expiation for sin; entire satisfaction has been given;the debt has been paid by the(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP227 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 47]Page 227Professor Leuba is undoubtedly right in contending that the conceptual belief about Christ's work, although so oftenefficacious and antecedent, is really accessory and non-essential, and that the 'joyous conviction' can also come by farother channels than this conception. It is to the joyous conviction itself, the assurance that all is well with one, that hewould give the name of faith par excellence.\"When the sense of estrangement,\" he writes, \"fencing man about in a narrowly limited ego, breaks down, the individual finds himself 'atone with all creation.' He lives in the universal life; he and man, he and nature, he and God, are one. That state of confidence, trust, unionwith all things, following upon the achievement of moral unity, is the Faith-state. Various dogmatic beliefs suddenly, on the advent ofthe faith-state, acquire a character of certainty, assume a new reality, become an object of faith. As the ground of assurance here is notrational, argumentation is irrelevant. But such conviction being a mere casual offshoot of the faith-state, it is a gross error to imagine thatthe chief practical value of the faith-state is its power to stamp with the seal of reality certain particular theological conceptions.1 On thecontrary, its value lies solely in the fact that it is the psychic correlate of a biological growth reducing contending desires to onedirection; a growth which expresses itself in new affective states and new reactions; in larger, nobler, more Christ-like activities. Theground of the specific assurance in religious dogmas is then an affective experience. The objects of faith may even(Footnote continued from previous page)Substitute. Christ has died for our sins; not for ours only, but for those of all men. If, then, the entire work is finished, all the debt paid,what remains for me to do?' In another instant the light was shed through my mind by the Holy Ghost, and the joyous conviction wasgiven me that nothing more was to be done, save to fall on my knees, to accept this Saviour and his love, to praise God forever.\"Autobiography of Hudson Taylor. I translate back into English from the French translation of Challand (Geneva, no date), the originalnot being accessible.1Tolstoy's case was a good comment on those words. There was almost no theology in his conversion. His faith-state was the sense comeback that life was infinite in its moral significance."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP228 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 49]Page 228be preposterous; the affective stream will float them along, and invest them with unshakable certitude. The more startling the affectiveexperience, the less explicable it seems, the easier it is to make it the carrier of unsubstantiated notions.\"1The characteristics of the affective experience which, to avoid ambiguity, should, I think, be called the state ofassurance rather than the faith-state, can be easily enumerated, though it is probably difficult to realize their intensity,unless one have been through the experience one's self.The central one is the loss of all the worry, the sense that all is ultimately well with one, the peace, the harmony, thewillingness to be, even though the outer conditions should remain the same. The certainty of God's 'grace,' of'justification,' 'salvation,' is an objective belief that usually accompanies the change in Christians; but this may beentirely lacking and yet the affective peace remain the same— you will recollect the case of the Oxford graduate: andmany might be given where the assurance of personal salvation was only a later result. A passion of willingness, ofacquiescence, of admiration, is the glowing centre of this state of mind.The second feature is the sense of perceiving truths not known before. The mysteries of life become lucid, asProfessor Leuba says; and often, nay usually, the solution is more or less unutterable in words. But these moreintellectual phenomena may be postponed until we treat of mysticism.A third peculiarity of the assurance state is the objective change which the world often appears to undergo. 'Anappearance of newness beautifies every object,' the precise opposite of that other sort of newness, that dreadfulunreality and strangeness in the appearance of the world, which is experienced by melancholy patients, and of whichyou may recall my relating some examples.2 This sense of clean and beautiful newness within and without is one ofthe commonest entries in conversion records. Jonathan Edwards thus describes it in himself:—\"After this my sense of divine things gradually increased,1American Journal of Psychology, vii. 345 347, abridged.2Above, p. 142."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP229 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 51]Page 229and became more and more lively, and had more of that inward sweetness. The appearance of everything was altered; there seemed to be,as it were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine glory, in almost everything. God's excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love,seemed to appear in everything; in the sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water andall nature; which used greatly to fix my mind. And scarce anything, among all the works of nature, was so sweet to me as thunder andlightning; formerly nothing had been so terrible to me. Before, I used to be uncommonly terrified with thunder, and to be struck withterror when I saw a thunderstorm rising; but now, on the contrary, it rejoices me.''1Billy Bray, an excellent little illiterate English evangelist, records his sense of newness thus:—\"I said to the Lord: 'Thou hast said, they that ask shall receive, they that seek shall find, and to them that knock the door shall be opened,and I have faith to believe it.' In an instant the Lord made me so happy that I cannot express what I felt. I shouted for joy. I praised Godwith my whole heart. I think this was in November, 1823, but what day of the month I do not know. I remember this, that everythinglooked new to me, the people, the fields, the cattle, the trees. I was like a new man in a new world. I spent the greater part of my time inpraising the Lord.\"2Starbuck and Leuba both illustrate this sense of newness by quotations. I take the two following from Starbuck'smanuscript collection. One, a woman, says:—\"I was taken to a camp-meeting, mother and religious friends seeking and praying for my conversion. My emotional nature was stirredto its depths; confessions of depravity and pleading with God for salvation from sin made me oblivious of all surroundings. I plead formercy, and had a vivid realization of forgiveness and renewal of my1DWIGHT: Life of Edwards, New York, 1830, p. 61, abridged.2W. F. BOURNE: The King's Son, a Memoir of Billy Bray, London, Hamilton, Adams & Co., 1887, p. 9."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP230 hl[01 03 2011 00 26 58]Page 230nature. When rising from my knees I exclaimed, 'Old things have passed away, all things have become new.' It was like entering anotherworld, a new state of existence. Natural objects were glorified, my spiritual vision was so clarified that I saw beauty in every materialobject in the universe, the woods were vocal with heavenly music; my soul exulted in the love of God, and I wanted everybody to sharein my joy.\"The next case is that of a man:—\"I know not how I got back into the encampment, but found myself staggering up to Rev. —'s Holiness tent—and as it was full ofseekers and a terrible noise inside, some groaning, some laughing, and some shouting, and by a large oak, ten feet from the tent, I fell onmy face by a bench, and tried to pray, and every time I would call on God, something like a man's hand would strangle me by choking. Idon't know whether there were any one around or near me or not. I thought I should surely die if I did not get help, but just as often as Iwould pray, that unseen hand was felt on my throat and my breath squeezed off. Finally something said: 'Venture on the atonement, foryou will die anyway if you don't.' So I made one final struggle to call on God for mercy, with the same choking and strangling,determined to finish the sentence of prayer for Mercy, if I did strangle and die, and the last I remember that time was falling back on theground with the same unseen hand on my throat. I don't know how long I lay there or what was going on. None of my folks were present.When I came to myself, there were a crowd around me praising God. The very heavens seemed to open and pour down rays of light andglory. Not for a moment only, but all day and night, floods of light and glory seemed to pour through my soul, and oh, how I waschanged, and everything became new. My horses and hogs and even everybody seemed changed.\"This man's case introduces the feature of automatisms, which in suggestible subjects have been so startling a feature atrevivals since, in Edwards's, Wesley's, and Whitefield's"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP231 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 10]Page 231time, these became a regular means of gospel-propagation. They were at first supposed to be semi-miraculous proofsof 'power' on the part of the Holy Ghost; but great divergence of opinion quickly arose concerning them. Edwards, inhis Thoughts on the Revival of Religion in New England, has to defend them against their critics; and their value haslong been matter of debate even within the revivalistic denominations.1 They undoubtedly have no essential spiritualsignificance, and although their presence makes his conversion more memorable to the convert, it has never beenproved that converts who show them are more persevering or fertile in good fruits than those whose change of hearthas had less violent accompaniments. On the whole, unconsciousness, convulsions, visions, involuntary vocalutterances, and suffocation, must be simply ascribed to the subject's having a large subliminal region, involvingnervous instability. This is often the subject's own view of the matter afterwards. One of Starbuck's correspondentswrites, for instance:—\"I have been through the experience which is known as conversion. My explanation of it is this: the subject works his emotions up to thebreaking point, at the same time resisting their physical manifestations, such as quickened pulse, etc., and then suddenly lets them havetheir full sway over his body. The relief is something wonderful, and the pleasurable effects of the emotions are experienced to thehighest degree.\"There is one form of sensory automatism which possibly deserves special notice on account of its frequency. I refer tohallucinatory or pseudo-hallucinatory luminous phenomena, photisms, to use the term of the psychologists. SaintPaul's blinding heavenly vision seems to have been a phenomen of this sort; so does Constantine's cross in the sky.The last case but one which I quoted mentions floods of light and glory. Henry Alline mentions a light, about whoseexternality he seems uncertain. Colonel Gardiner sees a blazing light. President Finney writes:—1Consult WILLIAM B. SPRAGUE: Lectures on Revivals of Religion, New York, 1832, in the long Appendix to which the opinions of alarge number of ministers are given."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP232 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 11]Page 232\"All at once the glory of God shone upon and round about me in a manner almost marvelous. A light perfectly ineffable shone in mysoul, that almost prostrated me on the ground. This light seemed like the brightness of the sun in every direction. It was too intense forthe eyes. I think I knew something then, by actual experience, of that light that prostrated Paul on the way to Damascus. It was surely alight such as I could not have endured long.\"1Such reports of photisms are indeed far from uncommon. Here is another from Starbuck's collection, where the lightappeared evidently external:—\"I had attended a series of revival services for about two weeks off and on. Had been invited to the altar several times, all the timebecoming more deeply impressed, when finally I decided I must do this, or I should be lost. Realization of conversion was very vivid,like a ton's weight being lifted from my heart; a strange light which seemed to light up the whole room (for it was dark); a conscioussupreme bliss which caused me to repeat 'Glory to God' for a long time. Decided to be God's child for life, and to give up my petambition, wealth and social position. My former habits of life hindered my growth somewhat, but I set about overcoming thesesystematically, and in one year my whole nature was changed, i. e., my ambitions were of a different order.\"Here is another one of Starbuck's cases, involving a luminous element:—\"I had been clearly converted twenty-three years before, or rather reclaimed. My experience in regeneration was then clear and spiritual,and I had not backslidden. But I experienced entire sanctification on the 15th day of March, 1893, about eleven o'clock in the morning.The particular accompaniments of the experience were entirely unexpected. I was quietly sitting at home singing selections out ofPentecostal Hymns. Suddenly there seemed to be a1Memoirs, p. 34."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP233 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 12]Page 233something sweeping into me and inflating my entire being—such a sensation as I had never experienced before. When this experiencecame, I seemed to be conducted around a large, capacious, well-lighted room. As I walked with my invisible conductor and lookedaround, a clear thought was coined in my mind, 'They are not here, they are gone.' As soon as the thought was definitely formed in mymind, though no word was spoken, the Holy Spirit impressed me that I was surveying my own soul. Then, for the first time in all my life,did I know that I was cleansed from all sin, and filled with the fullness of God.\"Leuba quotes the case of a Mr. Peck, where the luminous affection reminds one of the chromatic hallucinationsproduced by the intoxicant cactus buds called mescal by the Mexicans:—\"When I went in the morning into the fields to work, the glory of God appeared in all his visible creation. I well remember we reapedoats, and how every straw and head of the oats seemed, as it were, arrayed in a kind of rainbow glory, or to glow, if I may so express it,in the glory of God.\"1The most characteristic of all the elements of the conversion crisis, and the last one of which I shall speak, is theecstasy of happiness produced. We have already heard several1These reports of sensorial photism shade off into what are evidently only metaphorical accounts of the sense of new spiritualillumination, as, for instance, in Brainerd's statement: \"As I was walking in a thick grove, unspeakable glory seemed to open to theapprehension of my soul. I do not mean any external brightness, for I saw no such thing, nor any imagination of a body of light in thethird heavens, or anything of that nature, but it was a new inward apprehension or view that I had of God.\"In a case like this next one from Starbuck's manuscript collection, the lighting up of the darkness is probably also metaphorical:—\"One Sunday night, I resolved that when I got home to the ranch where I was working, I would offer myself with my faculties and all to Godto be used only by and for him. It was raining and the roads were muddy; but this desire grew so strong that I kneeled down by the side ofthe road and told God all about it, intending then to get up and go on. Such a thing as any special answer to my prayer never entered mymind, having been(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP234 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 14]Page 234accounts of it, but I will add a couple more. President Finney's is so vivid that I give it at length:—\"All my feelings seemed to rise and flow out; and the utterance of my heart was, 'I want to pour my whole soul out to God.' The rising ofmy soul was so great that I rushed into the back room of the front office, to pray. There was no fire and no light in the room; neverthelessit appeared to me as if it were perfectly light. As I went in and shut the door after me, it seemed as if I met the Lord Jesus Christ face toface. It did not occur to me then, nor did it for some time afterwards, that it was wholly a mental state. On the contrary, it seemed to methat I saw him as I would see any other man. He said nothing, but looked at me in such a manner as to break me right down at his feet. Ihave always since regarded this as a most remarkable state of mind; for it seemed to me a reality that he stood before me, and I fell downat his feet and poured out my soul to him. I wept aloud like a child, and made such confessions(Footnote continued from previous page)converted by faith, but still being most undoubtedly saved. Well, while I was praying, I remember holding out my hands to God andtelling him they should work for him, my feet walk for him, my tongue speak for him, etc., etc., if he would only use me as hisinstrument and give me a satisfying experience—when suddenly the darkness of the night seemed lit up—I felt, realized, knew, that Godheard and answered my prayer. Deep happiness came over me; I felt I was accepted into the inner circle of God's loved ones.\"In the following case also the flash of light is metaphorical:—\"A prayer meeting had been called for at close of evening service. The minister supposed me impressed by his discourse (a mistake—he wasdull). He came and, placing his hand upon my shoulder, said: 'Do you not want to give your heart to God?' I replied in the affirmative. Thensaid he, 'Come to the front seat.' They sang and prayed and talked with me. I experienced nothing but unaccountable wretchedness. Theydeclared that the reason why I did not 'obtain peace' was because I was not willing to give up all to God. After about two hours the ministersaid we would go home. As usual, on retiring, I prayed. In great distress, I at this time simply said, 'Lord, I have done all I can, I leave thewhole matter with thee.' Immediately, like a flash of light, there came to me a great peace, and I arose and went into my parents' bedroom andsaid, 'I do feel so wonderfully happy.' This I regard as the hour of conversion. It was the hour in which I became assured of divine acceptanceand favor. So far as my life was concerned, it made little immediate change.\""},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP235 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 15]Page 235as I could with my choked utterance. It seemed to me that I bathed his feet with my tears; and yet I had no distinct impression that Itouched him, that I recollect. I must have continued in this state for a good while; but my mind was too much absorbed with theinterview to recollect anything that I said. But I know, as soon as my mind became calm enough to break off from the interview, Ireturned to the front office, and found that the fire that I had made of large wood was nearly burned out. But as I turned and was about totake a seat by the fire, I received a mighty baptism of the Holy Ghost. Without any expectation of it, without ever having the thought inmy mind that there was any such thing for me, without any recollection that I had ever heard the thing mentioned by any person in theworld, the Holy Spirit descended upon me in a manner that seemed to go through me, body and soul. I could feel the impression, like awave of electricity, going through and through me. Indeed, it seemed to come in waves and waves of liquid love; for I could not expressit in any other way. It seemed like the very breath of God. I can recollect distinctly that it seemed to fan me, like immense wings.\"No words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in my heart. I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do not know but Ishould say I literally bellowed out the unutterable gushings of my heart. These waves came over me, and over me, and over me, oneafter the other, until I recollect I cried out, 'I shall die if these waves continue to pass over me.' I said, 'Lord, I cannot bear any more;' yet Ihad no fear of death.\"How long I continued in this state, with this baptism continuing to roll over me and go through me, I do not know. But I know it waslate in the evening when a member of my choir—for I was the leader of the choir—came into the office to see me. He was a member ofthe church. He found me in this state of loud weeping, and said to me, 'Mr. Finney, what ails you?' I could make him no answer for sometime. He then said, 'Are you in pain?' I gathered myself up as best I could, and replied, 'No, but so happy that I cannot live.'\""},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP236 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 16]Page 236I just now quoted Billy Bray; I cannot do better than give his own brief account of his post-conversion feelings:—\"I can't help praising the Lord.

It misses the point of serious interest, which is not somuch the duration as the nature and quality of these shiftings of character to higher levels. Men lapse from every level—we need no statistics to1I add in a note a few more records:—\"One morning, being in deep distress, fearing every moment I should drop into hell, I was constrained to cry in earnest for mercy, and theLord came to my relief, and delivered my soul from the burden and guilt of sin. My whole frame was in a tremor from head to foot, and mysoul enjoyed sweet peace. The pleasure I then felt was indescribable. The happiness lasted about three days, during which time I never spoketo any person about my feelings.\" Autobiography of DAN YOUNG, edited by W. P. STRICKLAND, New York, 1860.\"In an instant there rose up in me such a sense of God's taking care of those who put their trust in him that for an hour all the world wascrystalline, the heavens were lucid, and I sprang to my feet and began to cry and laugh.\" H. W. BEECHER, quoted by LEUBA.\"My tears of sorrow changed to joy, and I lay there praising God in such ecstasy of joy as only the soul who experiences it can realize.\"—\"Icannot express how I felt. It was as if I had been in a dark dungeon and lifted into the light of the sun. I shouted and I sang praise unto himwho loved me and washed me from my sins. I was forced to retire into a secret place, for the tears did flow, and I did not wish my shopmatesto see me, and yet I could not keep it a secret.\"—\"I experienced joy almost to weeping.''—\"I felt my face must have shone like that of Moses.I had a general feeling of buoyancy.

Love is, for instance, well known not to be irrevocable, yet, constant or inconstant, it reveals new flightsand reaches of ideality while it lasts. These revelations form its significance to men and women, whatever be itsduration. So with the conversion experience: that it should for even a short time show a human being what the high-water mark of his spiritual capacity is, this is what constitutes its importance,—an importance which backslidingcannot diminish, although persistence might increase it. As a matter of fact, all the more striking instances ofconversion, all those, for instance, which I have quoted, have been permanent. The case of which there might be mostdoubt, on account of its suggesting so strongly an epileptoid seizure, was the case of M. Ratisbonne. Yet I aminformed that Ratisbonne's whole future was shaped by those few minutes. He gave up his project of marriage, becamea priest, founded at Jerusalem, where he went to dwell, a mission of nuns for the conversion of the Jews, showed notendency to use for egotistic purposes the notoriety given him by the peculiar circumstances of his conversion,—which, for the rest, he could seldom refer to without tears,—and in short remained an exemplary son of the Churchuntil he died, late in the 80's, if I remember rightly.The only statistics I know of, on the subject of the duration of conversions, are those collected for Professor Starbuckby Miss Johnston. They embrace only a hundred persons, evangelical church-members, more than half beingMethodists. According to the statement of the subjects themselves, there had been backsliding of some sort in nearlyall the cases, 93 per cent. of the women, 77 per cent. of the men. Discussing the returns more minutely, Starbuck findsthat only 6 per cent. are relapses from the religious faith which the conversion confirmed, and that the backslidingcomplained of is in most only a fluctuation in the ardor of sentiment. Only six of the hundred cases report a change offaith. Starbuck's conclusion is that the effect of conversion is to bring with it \"a changed attitude towards life, which isfairly constant and permanent, although the feelings fluctuate. In other words, the persons who have passed throughconversion, having once taken"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP238 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 19]Page 238a stand for the religious life, tend to feel themselves identified with it, no matter how much their religious enthusiasmdeclines.\"11Psychology of Religion, pp. 360, 357."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP239 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 20]Page 239Lectures XI, XII, and XIIISaintlinessThe last lecture left us in a state of expectancy. What may the practical fruits for life have been, of such movinglyhappy conversions as those we heard of? With this question the really important part of our task opens, for youremember that we began all this empirical inquiry not merely to open a curious chapter in human consciousness, butrather to attain a spiritual judgment as to the total value and positive meaning of all the religious trouble andhappiness which we have seen. We must, therefore, first describe the fruits of the religious life, and then we mustjudge them. This divides our inquiry into two distinct parts. Let us without further preamble proceed to the descriptivetask.It ought to be the pleasantest portion of our business in these lectures. Some small pieces of it, it is true, may bepainful, or may show human nature in a pathetic light, but it will be mainly pleasant, because the best fruits ofreligious experience are the best things that history has to show. They have always been esteemed so; here ifanywhere is the genuinely strenuous life; and to call to mind a succession of such examples as I have lately had towander through, though it has been only in the reading of them, is to feel encouraged and uplifted and washed inbetter moral air.The highest flights of charity, devotion, trust, patience, bravery to which the wings of human nature have spreadthemselves have been flown for religious ideals. I can do no better than quote, as to this, some remarks which Sainte-Beuve in his History of Port-Royal makes on the results of conversion or the state of grace.\"Even from the purely human point of view,\" Sainte-Beuve says, \"the phenomenon of grace must still appearsufficiently extraordinary, eminent, and rare, both in its nature and in its effects, to deserve a closer study. For the soularrives thereby at a certain fixed and invincible state, a state which is genuinely heroic, and from out of which thegreatest deeds which it ever performs are executed.

Penetrate a little beneath the diversity ofcircumstances, and it becomes evident that in Christians of different epochs it is always one and the same modificationby which they are affected: there is veritably a single fundamental and identical spirit of piety and charity, common tothose who have received grace; an inner state which before all things is one of love and humility, of infiniteconfidence in God, and of severity for one's self, accompanied with tenderness for others. The fruits peculiar to thiscondition of the soul have the same savor in all, under distant suns and in different surroundings, in Saint Teresa ofAvila just as in any Moravian brother of Herrnhut.\"1Sainte-Beuve has here only the more eminent instances of regeneration in mind, and these are of course the instructiveones for us also to consider. These devotees have often laid their course so differently from other men that, judgingthem by worldly law, we might be tempted to call them monstrous aberrations from the path of nature. I begin,therefore, by asking a general psychological question as to what the inner conditions are which may make one humancharacter differ so extremely from another.I reply at once that where the character, as something distinguished from the intellect, is concerned, the causes ofhuman diversity lie chiefly in our differing susceptibilities of emotional excitement, and in the different impulses andinhibitions which these bring in their train. Let me make this more clear.Speaking generally, our moral and practical attitude, at any given time, is always a resultant of two sets of forceswithin us, impulses pushing us one way and obstructions and inhibitions holding us back. \"Yes! yes!\" say theimpulses; \"No! no!\" say the inhibitions. Few people who have not expressly reflected on the matter realize howconstantly this factor of inhibition is upon us, how it constrains and moulds us by its1SAINTE-BEUVE: Port-Royal, vol. i. pp. 95 and 106, abridged."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP241 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 22]Page 241restrictive pressure almost as if we were fluids pent within the cavity of a jar. The influence is so incessant that itbecomes subconscious. All of you, for example, sit here with a certain constraint at this moment, and entirely withoutexpress consciousness of the fact, because of the influence of the occasion. If left alone in the room, each of youwould probably involuntarily rearrange himself, and make his attitude more 'free and easy.' But proprieties and theirinhibitions snap like cobwebs if any great emotional excitement supervenes. I have seen a dandy appear in the streetwith his face covered with shaving-lather because a house across the way was on fire; and a woman will run amongstrangers in her nightgown if it be a question of saving her baby's life or her own. Take a self-indulgent woman's lifein general. She will yield to every inhibition set by her disagreeable sensations, lie late in bed, live upon tea orbromides, keep indoors from the cold. Every difficulty finds her obedient to its 'no.' But make a mother of her, andwhat have you? Possessed by maternal excitement, she now confronts wakefulness, weariness, and toil without aninstant of hesitation or a word of complaint. The inhibitive power of pain over her is extinguished wherever the baby'sinterests are at stake. The inconveniences which this creature occasions have become, as James Hinton says, theglowing heart of a great joy, and indeed are now the very conditions whereby the joy becomes most deep.This is an example of what you have already heard of as the 'expulsive power of a higher affection.' But be theaffection high or low, it makes no difference, so long as the excitement it brings be strong enough. In one of HenryDrummond's discourses he tells of an inundation in India where an eminence with a bungalow upon it remainedunsubmerged, and became the refuge of a number of wild animals and reptiles in addition to the human beings whowere there. At a certain moment a royal Bengal tiger appeared swimming towards it, reached it, and lay panting like adog upon the ground in the midst of the people, still possessed by such an agony of terror that one of the Englishmencould calmly step up with a rifle and blow out its brains. The tiger's habitual ferocity was temporarily quelled by theemotion of fear, which became sovereign, and formed a new centre for his character."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP242 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 24]Page 242Sometimes no emotional state is sovereign, but many contrary ones are mixed together. In that case one hears both'yeses' and 'noes,' and the 'will' is called on then to solve the conflict. Take a soldier, for example, with his dread ofcowardice impelling him to advance, his fears impelling him to run, and his propensities to imitation pushing himtowards various courses if his comrades offer various examples. His person becomes the seat of a mass ofinterferences; and he may for a time simply waver, because no one emotion prevails. There is a pitch of intensity,though, which, if any emotion reach it, enthrones that one as alone effective and sweeps its antagonists and all theirinhibitions away. The fury of his comrades' charge, once entered on, will give this pitch of courage to the soldier; thepanic of their rout will give this pitch of fear. In these sovereign excitements, things ordinarily impossible grownatural because the inhibitions are annulled. Their 'no! no!' not only is not heard, it does not exist. Obstacles are thenlike tissue-paper hoops to the circus rider—no impediment; the flood is higher than the dam they make. \"Lass siebetteln gehn wenn sie hungrig sind!\" cries the grenadier, frantic over his Emperor's capture, when his wife and babesare suggested; and men pent into a burning theatre have been known to cut their way through the crowd with knives.1One mode of emotional excitability is exceedingly important in the composition of the energetic character, from its1\"'Love would not be love,' says Bourget, 'unless it could carry one to crime.' And so one may say that no passion would be a veritablepassion unless it could carry one to crime.\" (SIGHELE: Psychologie des Sectes, p. 136.) In other words, great passions annul the ordinaryinhibitions set by 'conscience.' And conversely, of all the criminal human beings, the false, cowardly, sensual, or cruel persons whoactually live, there is perhaps not one whose criminal impulse may not be at some moment overpowered by the presence of some otheremotion to which his character is also potentially liable, provided that other emotion be only made intense enough. Fear is usually themost available emotion for this result in this particular class of persons. It stands for conscience, and may here be classed appropriatelyas a 'higher affection.' If we are soon to die, or if we believe a day of judgment to be near at hand, how quickly do we put our moralhouse in order—we do not see how sin can evermore exert temptation over us! Old-fashioned hell-fire Christianity well knew how toextract from fear its full equivalent in the way of fruits for repentance, and its full conversion value."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP243 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 25]Page 243peculiarly destructive power over inhibitions. I mean what in its lower form is mere irascibility, susceptibility towrath, the fighting temper; and what in subtler ways manifests itself as impatience, grimness, earnestness, severity ofcharacter. Earnestness means willingness to live with energy, though energy bring pain. The pain may be pain to otherpeople or pain to one's self—it makes little difference; for when the strenuous mood is on one, the aim is to breaksomething, no matter whose or what. Nothing annihilates an inhibition as irresistibly as anger does it; for, as Moltkesays of war, destruction pure and simple is its essence. This is what makes it so invaluable an ally of every otherpassion. The sweetest delights are trampled on with a ferocious pleasure the moment they offer themselves as checksto a cause by which our higher indignations are elicited. It costs then nothing to drop friendships, to renounce long-rooted privileges and possessions, to break with social ties. Rather do we take a stern joy in the astringency anddesolation; and what is called weakness of character seems in most cases to consist in the inaptitude for thesesacrificial moods, of which one's own inferior self and its pet softnesses must often be the targets and the victims.1So far I have spoken of temporary alterations produced by shifting excitements in the same person. But the relativelyfixed differences of character of different persons are explained in a precisely similar way. In a man with a liability toa special sort of emotion, whole ranges of inhibition habitually vanish, which in other men remain effective, and othersorts of inhibition take their place. When a person has an inborn genius for certain emotions, his life differs strangelyfrom that of ordinary people, for none of their usual deterrents check him. Your mere aspirant to a type of character,on the contrary, only shows, when your natural lover, fighter, or reformer, with whom the passion is a gift of nature,comes along, the1Example: Benjamin Constant was often marveled at as an extraordinary instance of superior intelligence with inferior character. Hewrites (Journal, Paris, 1895, p. 56), \"I am tossed and dragged about by my miserable weakness. Never was anything so ridiculous as myindecision. Now marriage, now solitude; now Germany, now France, hesitation upon hesitation, and all because at bottom I am unable togive up anything.\" He can't 'get mad' at any of his alternatives; and the career of a man beset by such an all-round amiability is hopeless."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP244 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 26]Page 244hopeless inferiority of voluntary to instinctive action. He has deliberately to overcome his inhibitions; the genius withthe inborn passion seems not to feel them at all; he is free of all that inner friction and nervous waste. To a Fox, aGaribaldi, a General Booth, a John Brown, a Louise Michel, a Bradlaugh, the obstacles omnipotent over those aroundthem are as if non-existent. Could the rest of us so disregard them, there might be many such heroes, for many havethe wish to live for similar ideals, and only the adequate degree of inhibition-quenching fury is lacking.1The difference between willing and merely wishing, between having ideals that are creative and ideals that are butpinings and regrets, thus depends solely either on the amount of steam-pressure chronically driving the character inthe ideal direction, or on the amount of ideal excitement transiently acquired. Given a certain amount of love,indignation, generosity, magnanimity, admiration, loyalty, or enthusiasm of self-surrender, the result is always thesame. That whole raft of cowardly obstructions, which in tame persons and dull moods are sovereign impediments toaction, sinks away at1The great thing which the higher excitabilities give is courage; and the addition or subtraction of a certain amount of this quality makesa different man, a different life. Various excitements let the courage loose. Trustful hope will do it; inspiring example will do it; love willdo it; wrath will do it. In some people it is natively so high that the mere touch of danger does it, though danger is for most men the greatinhibitor of action. 'Love of adventure' becomes in such persons a ruling passion. \"I believe,\" says General Skobeleff, \"that my bravery issimply the passion and at the same time the contempt of danger. The risk of life fills me with an exaggerated rapture. The fewer there areto share it, the more I like it. The participation of my body in the event is required to furnish me an adequate excitement. Everythingintellectual appears to me to be reflex; but a meeting of man to man, a duel, a danger into which I can throw myself headforemost,attracts me, moves me, intoxicates me. I am crazy for it, I love it, I adore it. I run after danger as one runs after women; I wish it never tostop. Were it always the same, it would always bring me a new pleasure. When I throw myself into an adventure in which I hope to findit, my heart palpitates with the uncertainty; I could wish at once to have it appear and yet to delay. A sort of painful and delicious shivershakes me; my entire nature runs to meet the peril with an impetus that my will would in vain try to resist.\" (JULIETTE ADAM: LeGénéral Skobeleff, Nouvelle Revue, 1886, abridged.) Skobeleff seems to have been a cruel egoist; but the disinterested Garibaldi, if onemay judge by his 'Memorie,' lived in an unflagging emotion of similar danger-seeking excitement."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP245 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 27]Page 245once. Our conventionality,1 our shyness, laziness, and stinginess, our demands for precedent and permission, forguarantee and surety, our small suspicions, timidities, despairs, where are they now? Severed like cobwebs, brokenlike bubbles in the sun—\"Wo sind die Sorge nun und NothDie mich noch gestern wollt' erschlaffen?Ich schäm' mich dess' im Morgenroth.\"The flood we are borne on rolls them so lightly under that their very contact is unfelt. Set free of them, we float andsoar and sing. This auroral openness and uplift gives to all creative ideal levels a bright and caroling quality, which isnowhere more marked than where the controlling emotion is religious. \"The true monk,\" writes an Italian mystic,\"takes nothing with him but his lyre.\"We may now turn from these psychological generalities to those fruits of the religious state which form the specialsubject of our present lecture. The man who lives in his religious centre of personal energy, and is actuated byspiritual enthusiasms, differs from his previous carnal self in perfectly definite ways. The new ardor which burns inhis breast consumes in its glow the lower 'noes' which formerly beset him, and keeps him immune against infectionfrom the entire groveling portion of his nature. Magnanimities once impossible are now easy; paltry conventionalitiesand mean incentives once tyrannical hold no sway. The stone wall inside of him has fallen, the hardness in his hearthas broken down. The rest of us can, I think, imagine this by recalling our state of feeling in those temporary 'meltingmoods' into which either the trials of real life, or the theatre, or a novel sometimes throw us. Especially if we weep!For it is then as if our tears broke through an inveterate inner dam, and let all sorts of ancient peccancies and moralstagnancies drain away, leaving us now washed and soft of heart and open to every nobler leading. With most of usthe customary hardness quickly returns, but1See the case on p. 70, above, where the writer describes his experiences of communion with the Divine as consisting \"merely in thetemporary obliteration of the conventionalities which usually cover my life.\""},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP246 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 34]Page 246not so with saintly persons. Many saints, even as energetic ones as Teresa and Loyola, have possessed what thechurch traditionally reveres as a special grace, the so-called gift of tears. In these persons the melting mood seems tohave held almost uninterrupted control. And as it is with tears and melting moods, so it is with other exaltedaffections. Their reign may come by gradual growth or by a crisis; but in either case it may have 'come to stay.'At the end of the last lecture we saw this permanence to be true of the general paramountcy of the higher insight, eventhough in the ebbs of emotional excitement meaner motives might temporarily prevail and backsliding might occur.But that lower temptations may remain completely annulled, apart from transient emotion and as if by alteration of theman's habitual nature, is also proved by documentary evidence in certain cases. Before embarking on the generalnatural history of the regenerate character, let me convince you of this curious fact by one or two examples. The mostnumerous are those of reformed drunkards. You recollect the case of Mr. Hadley in the last lecture; the Jerry McAuleyWater Street Mission abounds in similar instances.1 You also remember the graduate of Oxford, converted at three inthe afternoon, and getting drunk in the hay-field the next day, but after that permanently cured of his appetite. ''Fromthat hour drink has had no terrors for me: I never touch it, never want it. The same thing occurred with my pipe, thedesire for it went at once and has never returned. So with every known sin, the deliverance in each case beingpermanent and complete. I have had no temptations since conversion.\"Here is an analogous case from Starbuck's manuscript collection:—\"I went into the old Adelphi Theatre, where there was a Holiness meeting, and I began saying, 'Lord, Lord, I must have this blessing.'Then what was to me an audible voice said: 'Are you willing to give up everything to the Lord?' and question after question kept comingup, to all of which I said: 'Yes, Lord; yes, Lord!' until this came:1Above, p. 188. \"The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania,\" is a saying I have heard quoted from some medicalman."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP247 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 45]Page 247'Why do you not accept it now?' and I said: 'I do, Lord.'— I felt no particular joy, only a trust. Just then the meeting closed, and, as Iwent out on the street, I met a gentleman smoking a fine cigar, and a cloud of smoke came into my face, and I took a long, deep breath ofit, and praise the Lord, all my appetite for it was gone. Then as I walked along the street, passing saloons where the fumes of liquor cameout, I found that all my taste and longing for that accursed stuff was gone. Glory to God! [But] for ten or eleven long years [after that] Iwas in the wilderness with its ups and downs. My appetite for liquor never came back.\"The classic case of Colonel Gardiner is that of a man cured of sexual temptation in a single hour. To Mr. Spears thecolonel said, \"I was effectually cured of all inclination to that sin I was so strongly addicted to that I thought nothingbut shooting me through the head could have cured me of it; and all desire and inclination to it was removed, asentirely as if I had been a sucking child; nor did the temptation return to this day.\" Mr. Webster's words on the samesubject are these: \"One thing I have heard the colonel frequently say, that he was much addicted to impurity before hisacquaintance with religion; but that, so soon as he was enlightened from above, he felt the power of the Holy Ghostchanging his nature so wonderfully that his sanctification in this respect seemed more remarkable than in any other.\"1Such rapid abolition of ancient impulses and propensities reminds us so strongly of what has been observed as theresult of hypnotic suggestion that it is difficult not to believe that subliminal influences play the decisive part in theseabrupt changes of heart, just as they do in hypnotism.2 Suggestive1Doddridge's Life of Colonel James Gardiner, London Religious Tract Society, pp. 23 32.2Here, for example, is a case, from Starbuck's book, in which a 'sensory automatism' brought about quickly what prayers and resolves hadbeen unable to effect. The subject is a woman. She writes:—\"When I was about forty I tried to quit smoking, but the desire was on me, and had me in its power. I cried and prayed and promised God toquit, but could not. I had smoked for fifteen years. When I was fifty-three, as I sat by the fire one day smoking, a voice came to me. I did nothear it with my(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP248 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 46]Page 248therapeutics abound in records of cure, after a few sittings, of inveterate bad habits with which the patient, left toordinary moral and physical influences, had struggled in vain. Both drunkenness and sexual vice have been cured inthis way, action through the subliminal seeming thus in many individuals to have the prerogative of inducingrelatively stable change. If the grace of God miraculously operates, it probably operates through the subliminal door,then. But just how anything operates in this region is still unexplained, and we shall do well now to say good-by tothe process of transformation altogether,—leaving it, if you like, a good deal of a psychological or theologicalmystery,—and to turn our attention to the fruits of the religious condition, no matter in what way they may have beenproduced.1(Footnote continued from previous page)ears, but more as a dream or sort of double think. It said, 'Louisa, lay down smoking.' At once I replied, 'Will you take the desire away?'But it only kept saying: 'Louisa, lay down smoking.' Then I got up, laid my pipe on the mantel-shelf, and never smoked again or had anydesire to. The desire was gone as though I had never known it or touched tobacco. The sight of others smoking and the smell of smokenever gave me the least wish to touch it again.\" The Psychology of Religion, p. 142.1Professor Starbuck expresses the radical destruction of old influences physiologically, as a cutting off of the connection between higher andlower cerebral centres. \"This condition,\" he says, \"in which the association-centres connected with the spiritual life are cut off from the lower,is often reflected in the way correspondents describe their experiences. For example: 'Temptations from without still assail me, but there isnothing within to respond to them.' The ego [here] is wholly identified with the higher centres, whose quality of feeling is that of withinness.Another of the respondents says: 'Since then, although Satan tempts me, there is as it were a wall of brass around me, so that his darts cannottouch me.'\"—Unquestionably, functional exclusions of this sort must occur in the cerebral organ. But on the side accessible to introspection,their causal condition is nothing but the degree of spiritual excitement, getting at last so high and strong as to be sovereign; and it must befrankly confessed that we do not know just why or how such sovereignty comes about in one person and not in another. We can only giveour imagination a certain delusive help by mechanical analogies.If we should conceive, for example, that the human mind, with its different possibilities of equilibrium, might be like a many-sided solidwith different surfaces on which it could lie flat, we might liken mental revolutions to the spatial revolutions of such a body. As it is pried up,say by a lever, from a position in which it lies on surface A, for instance, it will linger for a time(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP249 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 48]Page 249The collective name for the ripe fruits of religion in a character is Saintliness.1 The saintly character is the characterfor which spiritual emotions are the habitual centre of the personal energy; and there is a certain compositephotograph of universal saintliness, the same in all religions, of which the features can easily be traced.2They are these:—1. A feeling of being in a wider life than that of this world's selfish little interests; and a conviction, not merely intellectual, but as it weresensible, of the existence of an Ideal Power. In Christian saintliness this power is always personified as God; but abstract moral ideals,civic or patriotic utopias, or inner visions of holiness or right may also be felt as the true lords(Footnote continued from previous page)unstably halfway up, and if the lever cease to urge it, it will tumble back or 'relapse' under the continued pull of gravity. But if at last itrotate far enough for its centre of gravity to pass beyond surface A altogether, the body will fall over, on surface B, say, and abide therepermanently. The pulls of gravity towards A have vanished, and may now be disregarded. The polyhedron has become immune againstfarther attraction from their direction.In this figure of speech the lever may correspond to the emotional influences making for a new life, and the initial pull of gravity to theancient drawbacks and inhibitions. So long as the emotional influence fails to reach a certain pitch of efficacy, the changes it produces areunstable, and the man relapses into his original attitude. But when a certain intensity is attained by the new emotion, a critical point is passed,and there then ensues an irreversible revolution, equivalent to the production of a new nature.1I use this word in spite of a certain flavor of 'sanctimoniousness' which sometimes clings to it, because no other word suggests as well theexact combination of affections which the text goes on to describe.2\"It will be found,\" says Dr. W. R. INGE (in his lectures on Christian Mysticism, London, 1899, p. 326), \"that men of preëminent saintlinessagree very closely in what they tell us. They tell us that they have arrived at an unshakable conviction, not based on inference but onimmediate experience, that God is a spirit with whom the human spirit can hold intercourse; that in him meet all that they can imagine ofgoodness, truth, and beauty; that they can see his footprints everywhere in nature, and feel his presence within them as the very life of theirlife, so that in proportion as they come to themselves they come to him. They tell us what separates us from him and from happiness is, first,self-seeking in all its forms; and, secondly, sensuality in all its forms; that these are the ways of darkness and death, which hide from us theface of God; while the path of the just is like a shining light, which shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\""},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP250 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 49]Page 250and enlargers of our life, in ways which I described in the lecture on the Reality of the Unseen.12. A sense of the friendly continuity of the ideal power with our own life, and a willing self-surrender to its control.3. An immense elation and freedom, as the outlines of the confining selfhood melt down.4. A shifting of the emotional centre towards loving and harmonious affections, towards 'yes, yes,' and away from 'no,' where the claimsof the non-ego are concerned.1The 'enthusiasm of humanity' may lead to a life which coalesces in many respects with that of Christian saintliness. Take the followingrules proposed to members of the Union pour l'Action morale, in the Bulletin de l'Union, April 1 15, 1894. See, also, Revue Bleue,August 13, 1892.\"We would make known in our own persons the usefulness of rule, of discipline, of resignation and renunciation; we would teach thenecessary perpetuity of suffering, and explain the creative part which it plays. We would wage war upon false optimism; on the base hope ofhappiness coming to us ready made; on the notion of a salvation by knowledge alone, or by material civilization alone, vain symbol as this isof civilization, precarious external arrangement, ill-fitted to replace the intimate union and consent of souls. We would wage war also on badmorals, whether in public or in private life; on luxury, fastidiousness, and over-refinement; on all that tends to increase the painful, immoral,and anti-social multiplication of our wants; on all that excites envy and dislike in the soul of the common people, and confirms the notion thatthe chief end of life is freedom to enjoy. We would preach by our example the respect of superiors and equals, the respect of all men;affectionate simplicity in our relations with inferiors and insignificant persons; indulgence where our own claims only are concerned, butfirmness in our demands where they relate to duties towards others or towards the public.\"For the common people are what we help them to become; their vices are our vices, gazed upon, envied, and imitated; and if they come backwith all their weight upon us, it is but just.\"We forbid ourselves all seeking after popularity, all ambition to appear important.

Asceticism.—The self-surrender may become so passionate as to turn into self-immolation. It may then so overrulethe ordinary inhibitions of the flesh that the saint finds positive pleasure in sacrifice and asceticism, measuring andexpressing as they do the degree of his loyalty to the higher power.b. Strength of Soul.—The sense of enlargement of life may be so uplifting that personal motives and inhibitions,commonly omnipotent, become too insignificant for notice, and new reaches of patience and fortitude open out. Fearsand anxieties go, and blissful equanimity takes their place. Come heaven, come hell, it makes no difference now!c. Purity.—The shifting of the emotional centre brings with it, first, increase of purity. The sensitiveness to spiritualdiscords is enhanced, and the cleansing of existence from brutal and sensual elements becomes imperative. Occasionsof contact with such elements are avoided: the saintly life must deepen its spiritual consistency and keep unspottedfrom the world. In some temperaments this need of purity of spirit takes an ascetic turn, and weaknesses of the fleshare treated with relentless severity.d. Charity.—The shifting of the emotional centre brings, secondly, increase of charity, tenderness for fellow-creatures.The ordinary motives to antipathy, which usually set such close bounds to tenderness among human beings, areinhibited. The saint loves his enemies, and treats loathsome beggars as his brothers.I now have to give some concrete illustrations of these fruits of the spiritual tree. The only difficulty is to choose, forthey are so abundant.Since the sense of Presence of a higher and friendly Power seems to be the fundamental feature in the spiritual life, Iwill begin with that.In our narratives of conversion we saw how the world might look shining and transfigured to the convert,1 and,1Above, pp. 228 ff."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP252 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 52]Page 252apart from anything acutely religious, we all have moments when the universal life seems to wrap us round withfriendliness. In youth and health, in summer, in the woods or on the mountains, there come days when the weatherseems all whispering with peace, hours when the goodness and beauty of existence enfold us like a dry warm climate,or chime through us as if our inner ears were subtly ringing with the world's security. Thoreau writes:—\"Once, a few weeks after I came to the woods, for an hour I doubted whether the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a sereneand healthy life. To be alone was somewhat unpleasant. But, in the midst of a gentle rain, while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenlysensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sight and sound around myhouse, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once, like an atmosphere, sustaining me, as made the fancied advantages ofhuman neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them since. Every little pine-needle expanded and swelled with sympathyand befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to me, that I thought no place could ever bestrange to me again.\"1In the Christian consciousness this sense of the enveloping friendliness becomes most personal and definite. \"Thecompensation,\" writes a German author, \"for the loss of that sense of personal independence which man sounwillingly gives up, is the disappearance of all fear from one's life, the quite indescribable and inexplicable feeling ofan inner security, which one can only experience, but which, once it has been experienced, one can never forget.\"2I find an excellent description of this state of mind in a sermon by Mr. Voysey:—\"It is the experience of myriads of trustful souls, that this sense of God's unfailing presence with them in their going out and in theircoming in, and by night and day, is a1H.

It drives away all fear of what may befall them. That nearness of God is a constantsecurity against terror and anxiety. It is not that they are at all assured of physical safety, or deem themselves protected by a love which isdenied to others, but that they are in a state of mind equally ready to be safe or to meet with injury. If injury befall them, they will becontent to bear it because the Lord is their keeper, and nothing can befall them without his will. If it be his will, then injury is for them ablessing and no calamity at all. Thus and thus only is the trustful man protected and shielded from harm. And I for one—by no means athick-skinned or hard-nerved man—am absolutely satisfied with this arrangement, and do not wish for any other kind of immunity fromdanger and catastrophe. Quite as sensitive to pain as the most highly strung organism, I yet feel that the worst of it is conquered, and thesting taken out of it altogether, by the thought that God is our loving and sleepless keeper, and that nothing can hurt us without his will.\"1More excited expressions of this condition are abundant in religious literature. I could easily weary you with theirmonotony. Here is an account from Mrs. Jonathan Edwards:—\"Last night,\" Mrs. Edwards writes, \"was the sweetest night I ever had in my life. I never before, for so long a time together, enjoyed somuch of the light and rest and sweetness of heaven in my soul, but without the least agitation of body during the whole time. Part of thenight I lay awake, sometimes asleep, and sometimes between sleeping and waking. But all night I continued in a constant, clear, andlively sense of the heavenly sweetness of Christ's excellent love, of his nearness to me, and of my dearness to him; with an inexpressiblysweet calmness of soul in an entire rest in him. I seemed to myself to perceive a glow of divine love come down from the heart of Christin heaven into my heart in a constant stream, like a stream or pencil of sweet light. At the same time my heart and soul all1The Mystery of Pain and Death, London, 1892, p. 258."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP254 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 55]Page 254flowed out in love to Christ, so that there seemed to be a constant flowing and reflowing of heavenly love, and I appeared to myself tofloat or swim, in these bright, sweet beams, like the motes swimming in the beams of the sun, or the streams of his light which come in atthe window. I think that what I felt each minute was worth more than all the outward comfort and pleasure which I had enjoyed in mywhole life put together. It was pleasure, without the least sting, or any interruption. It was a sweetness, which my soul was lost in; itseemed to be all that my feeble frame could sustain. There was but little difference, whether I was asleep or awake, but if there was anydifference, the sweetness was greatest while I was asleep.1 As I awoke early the next morning, it seemed to me that I had entirely donewith myself. I felt that the opinions of the world concerning me were nothing, and that I had no more to do with any outward interest ofmy own than with that of a person whom I never saw. The glory of God seemed to swallow up every wish and desire of my heart. Afterretiring to rest and sleeping a little while, I awoke, and was led to reflect on God's mercy to me, in giving me, for many years, awillingness to die; and after that, in making me willing to live, that I might do and suffer whatever he called me to here. I also thoughthow God had graciously given me an entire resignation to his will, with respect to the kind and manner of death that I should die; havingbeen made willing to die on the rack, or at the stake, and if it were God's will, to die in darkness. But now it occurred to me, I used tothink of living no longer than to the ordinary age of man. Upon this I was led to ask myself, whether I was not1Compare Madame Guyon: \"It was my practice to arise at midnight for purposes of devotion. It seemed to me that God came at theprecise time and woke me from sleep in order that I might enjoy him. When I was out of health or greatly fatigued, he did not awake me,but at such times I felt, even in my sleep, a singular possession of God. He loved me so much that he seemed to pervade my being, at atime when I could be only imperfectly conscious of his presence. My sleep is sometimes broken,—a sort of half sleep; but my soulseems to be awake enough to know God, when it is hardly capable of knowing anything else.\" T. C.

And it seemed to me that I found a perfectwillingness, quietness, and alacrity of soul in consenting that it should be so, if it were most for the glory of God, so that there was nohesitation, doubt, or darkness in my mind. The glory of God seemed to overcome me and swallow me up, and every conceivablesuffering, and everything that was terrible to my nature, seemed to shrink to nothing before it. This resignation continued in its clearnessand brightness the rest of the night, and all the next day, and the night following, and on Monday in the forenoon, without interruption orabatement.\"1The annals of Catholic saintship abound in records as ecstatic or more ecstatic than this. \"Often the assaults of thedivine love,\" it is said of the Sister Séraphique de la Martinière, \"reduced her almost to the point of death. She usedtenderly to complain of this to God. 'I cannot support it,' she used to say. 'Bear gently with my weakness, or I shallexpire under the violence of your love.'\"2Let me pass next to the Charity and Brotherly Love which are a usual fruit of saintliness, and have always beenreckoned essential theological virtues, however limited may have been the kinds of service which the particulartheology enjoined. Brotherly love would follow logically from the assurance of God's friendly presence, the notion ofour brotherhood as men being an immediate inference from that of God's fatherhood of us all. When Christ utters theprecepts: \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them whichdespitefully use you, and persecute you,\" he gives for a reason: \"That ye may be the1I have considerably abridged the words of the original, which is given in EDWARDS'S Narrative of the Revival in New England.2BOUGAUD: Hist. de la Bienheureuse Marguerite Marie, 1894, p. 125."},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP256 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 58]Page 256children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rainon the just and on the unjust.'' One might therefore be tempted to explain both the humility as to one's self and thecharity towards others which characterize spiritual excitement, as results of the all-leveling character of theistic belief.But these affections are certainly not mere derivatives of theism. We find them in Stoicism, in Hinduism, and inBuddhism in the highest possible degree. They harmonize with paternal theism beautifully; but they harmonize withall reflection whatever upon the dependence of mankind on general causes; and we must, I think, consider them notsubordinate but coördinate parts of that great complex excitement in the study of which we are engaged. Religiousrapture, moral enthusiasm, onto-logical wonder, cosmic emotion, are all unifying states of mind, in which the sandand grit of the selfhood incline to disappear, and tenderness to rule. The best thing is to describe the conditionintegrally as a characteristic affection to which our nature is liable, a region in which we find ourselves at home, a seain which we swim; but not to pretend to explain its parts by deriving them too cleverly from one another. Like love orfear, the faith-state is a natural psychic complex, and carries charity with it by organic consequence. Jubilation is anexpansive affection, and all expansive affections are self-forgetful and kindly so long as they endure.We find this the case even when they are pathological in origin. In his instructive work, la Tristesse et la Joie,1 M.Georges Dumas compares together the melancholy and the joyous phase of circular insanity, and shows that, whileselfishness characterizes the one, the other is marked by altruistic impulses. No human being so stingy and useless aswas Marie in her melancholy period! But the moment the happy period begins, \"sympathy and kindness become hercharacteristic sentiments. She displays a universal goodwill, not only of intention, but in act. She becomes solicitousof the health of other patients, interested in getting them out, desirous to procure wool to knit socks for some of them.Never since she has been under my observation have I heard her in her joyous1Paris, 1900."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP257 hl[01 03 2011 00 27 59]Page 257period utter any but charitable opinions.\"1 And later, Dr. Dumas says of all such joyous conditions that \"unselfishsentiments and tender emotions are the only affective states to be found in them. The subject's mind is closed againstenvy, hatred, and vindictiveness, and wholly transformed into benevolence, indulgence, and mercy.\"2There is thus an organic affinity between joyousness and tenderness, and their companionship in the saintly life needin no way occasion surprise. Along with the happiness, this increase of tenderness is often noted in narratives ofconversion. \"I began to work for others\";—\"I had more tender feeling for my family and friends\";—''I spoke at onceto a person with whom I had been angry\";—\"I felt for every one, and loved my friends better\";—\"I felt every one tobe my friend\";—these are so many expressions from the records collected by Professor Starbuck.3\"When,\" says Mrs. Edwards, continuing the narrative from which I made quotation a moment ago, \"I arose on the morning of theSabbath, I felt a love to all mankind, wholly peculiar in its strength and sweetness, far beyond all that I had ever felt before. The powerof that love seemed inexpressible. I thought, if I were surrounded by enemies, who were venting their malice and cruelty upon me, intormenting me, it would still be impossible that I should cherish any feelings towards them but those of love, and pity, and ardent desiresfor their happiness. I never before felt so far from a disposition to judge and censure others, as I did that morning. I realized also, in anunusual and very lively manner, how great a part of Christianity lies in the performance of our social and relative duties to one another.The same joyful sense continued throughout the day—a sweet love to God and all mankind.\"Whatever be the explanation of the charity, it may efface all usual human barriers.41Page 130.2Page 167.3Op. cit., p. 127.4The barrier between men and animals also. We read of Towianski, an eminent Polish patriot and mystic, that \"one day one of his friendsmet him in the rain, caressing a big dog which was jumping upon him and covering(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP258 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 00]Page 258Here, for instance, is an example of Christian non-resistance from Richard Weaver's autobiography. Weaver was acollier, a semi-professional pugilist in his younger days, who became a much beloved evangelist. Fighting, afterdrinking, seems to have been the sin to which he originally felt his flesh most perversely inclined. After his firstconversion he had a backsliding, which consisted in pounding a man who had insulted a girl. Feeling that, havingonce fallen, he might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, he got drunk and went and broke the jaw ofanother man who had lately challenged him to fight and taunted him with cowardice for refusing as a Christian man;—I mention these incidents to show how genuine a change of heart is implied in the later conduct which he describesas follows:—\"I went down the drift and found the boy crying because a fellow-workman was trying to take the wagon from him by force. I said tohim:—\"'Tom, you must n't take that wagon.'\"He swore at me, and called me a Methodist devil. I told him that God did not tell me to let him rob me. He cursed again, and said hewould push the wagon over me.\"'Well,' I said, 'let us see whether the devil and thee are stronger than the Lord and me.'\"And the Lord and I proving stronger than the devil and he, he had to get out of the way, or the wagon would have(Footnote continued from previous page)him horribly with mud. On being asked why he permitted the animal thus to dirty his clothes, Towianski replied: 'This dog, whom I amnow meeting for the first time, has shown a great fellow-feeling for me, and a great joy in my recognition and acceptance of hisgreetings. Were I to drive him off, I should wound his feelings and do him a moral injury. It would be an offense not only to him, but toall the spirits of the other world who are on the same level with him. The damage which he does to my coat is as nothing in comparisonwith the wrong which I should inflict upon him, in case I were to remain indifferent to the manifestations of his friendship. We ought,'he added, 'both to lighten the condition of animals, whenever we can, and at the same time to facilitate in ourselves that union of theworld of all spirits, which the sacrifice of Christ has made possible.'\" André Towianski, Traduction de l'Italien, Turin, 1897 (privatelyprinted).

Then said Tom:—\"'I've a good mind to smack thee on the face.'\"'Well,' I said, 'if that will do thee any good, thou canst do it.' So he struck me on the face.\"I turned the other cheek to him, and said, 'Strike again.'\"He struck again and again, till he had struck me five times. I turned my cheek for the sixth stroke; but he turned away cursing. I shoutedafter him: 'The Lord forgive thee, for I do, and the Lord save thee.'\"This was on a Saturday; and when I went home from the coal-pit my wife saw my face was swollen, and asked what was the matterwith it. I said: 'I've been fighting, and I've given a man a good thrashing.'\"She burst out weeping, and said, 'O Richard, what made you fight?' Then I told her all about it; and she thanked the Lord I had notstruck back.\"But the Lord had struck, and his blows have more effect than man's. Monday came. The devil began to tempt me, saying: 'The othermen will laugh at thee for allowing Tom to treat thee as he did on Saturday.' I cried, 'Get thee behind me, Satan;'—and went on my wayto the coal-pit.\"Tom was the first man I saw. I said 'Good-morning,' but got no reply.\"He went down first. When I got down, I was surprised to see him sitting on the wagon-road waiting for me. When I came to him heburst into tears and said: 'Richard, will you forgive me for striking you?'\"'I have forgiven thee,' said I; 'ask God to forgive thee. The Lord bless thee.' I gave him my hand, and we went each to his work.\"1'Love your enemies!' Mark you, not simply those who happen not to be your friends, but your enemies, your positiveand active enemies. Either this is a mere Oriental hyperbole, a bit of verbal extravagance, meaning only that weshould, as far as we can, abate our animosities, or else it is sincere and literal. Outside of certain cases of intimateindividual relation, it seldom has been taken literally. Yet it makes one ask the1J.

Ifpositive well-wishing could attain so supreme a degree of excitement, those who were swayed by it might well seemsuperhuman beings. Their life would be morally discrete from the life of other men, and there is no saying, in theabsence of positive experience of an authentic kind,—for there are few active examples in our scriptures, and theBuddhistic examples are legendary,1—what the effects might be: they might conceivably transform the world.Psychologically and in principle, the precept 'Love your enemies' is not self-contradictory. It is merely the extremelimit of a kind of magnanimity with which, in the shape of pitying tolerance of our oppressors, we are fairly familiar.Yet if radically followed, it would involve such a breach with out instinctive springs of action as a whole, and withthe present world's arrangements, that a critical point would practically be passed, and we should be born into anotherkingdom of being. Religious emotion makes us feel that other kingdom to be close at hand, within our reach.The inhibition of instinctive repugnance is proved not only by the showing of love to enemies, but by the showing ofit to any one who is personally loathsome. In the annals of saintliness we find a curious mixture of motives impellingin this direction. Asceticism plays its part; and along with charity pure and simple, we find humility or the desire todisclaim distinction and to grovel on the common level before God. Certainly all three principles were at work whenFrancis of Assisi and Ignatius Loyola exchanged their garments with those of filthy beggars. All three are at workwhen religious persons consecrate their lives to the care of leprosy or other peculiarly unpleasant diseases. The nursingof the sick is a function to which the religious seem strongly drawn, even apart from the fact that church traditions setthat way. But in the annals of this sort of charity we find fantastic excesses of1As where the future Buddha, incarnated as a hare, jumps into the fire to cook himself for a meal for a beggar—having previouslyshaken himself three times, so that none of the insects in his fur should perish with him."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP261 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 10]Page 261devotion recorded which are only explicable by the frenzy of self-immolation simultaneously aroused. Francis ofAssisi kisses his lepers; Margaret Mary Alacoque, Francis Xavier, St. John of God, and others are said to havecleansed the sores and ulcers of their patients with their respective tongues; and the lives of such saints as Elizabethof Hungary and Madame de Chantal are full of a sort of reveling in hospital purulence, disagreeable to read of, andwhich makes us admire and shudder at the same time.So much for the human love aroused by the faith-state. Let me next speak of the Equanimity, Resignation, Fortitude,and Patience which it brings.'A paradise of inward tranquillity' seems to be faith's usual result; and it is easy, even without being religious one'sself, to understand this. A moment back, in treating of the sense of God's presence, I spoke of the unaccountablefeeling of safety which one may then have. And, indeed, how can it possibly fail to steady the nerves, to cool thefever, and appease the fret, if one be sensibly conscious that, no matter what one's difficulties for the moment mayappear to be, one's life as a whole is in the keeping of a power whom one can absolutely trust? In deeply religiousmen the abandonment of self to this power is passionate. Whoever not only says, but feels, 'God's will be done,' ismailed against every weakness; and the whole historic array of martyrs, missionaries, and religious reformers is thereto prove the tranquil-mindedness, under naturally agitating or distressing circumstances, which self-surrender brings.The temper of the tranquil-mindedness differs, of course, according as the person is of a constitutionally sombre or ofa constitutionally cheerful cast of mind. In the sombre it partakes more of resignation and submission; in the cheerfulit is a joyous consent. As an example of the former temper, I quote part of a letter from Professor Lagneau, avenerated teacher of philosophy who lately died, a great invalid, at Paris:—\"My life, for the success of which you send good wishes, will be what it is able to be. I ask nothing from it, I expect"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP262 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 22]Page 262nothing from it. For long years now I exist, think, and act, and am worth what I am worth, only through the despair which is my solestrength and my sole foundation. May it preserve for me, even in these last trials to which I am coming, the courage to do without thedesire of deliverance. I ask nothing more from the Source whence all strength cometh, and if that is granted, your wishes will have beenaccomplished.\"1There is something pathetic and fatalistic about this, but the power of such a tone as a protection against outwardshocks is manifest. Pascal is another Frenchman of pessimistic natural temperament. He expresses still more amply thetemper of self-surrendering submissiveness:—\"Deliver me, Lord,\" he writes in his prayers, \"from the sadness at my proper suffering which self-love might give, but put into me asadness like your own. Let my sufferings appease your choler. Make them an occasion for my conversion and salvation. I ask you neitherfor health nor for sickness, for life nor for death; but that you may dispose of my health and my sickness, my life and my death, for yourglory, for my salvation, and for the use of the Church and of your saints, of whom I would by your grace be one. You alone know what isexpedient for me; you are the sovereign master; do with me according to your will. Give to me, or take away from me, only conform mywill to yours. I know but one thing, Lord, that it is good to follow you, and bad to offend you. Apart from that, I know not what is goodor bad in anything. I know not which is most profitable to me, health or sickness, wealth or poverty, nor anything else in the world. Thatdiscernment is beyond the power of men or angels, and is hidden among the secrets of your Providence, which I adore, but do not seek tofathom.\"2When we reach more optimistic temperaments, the resignation grows less passive. Examples are sown so broadcastthroughout history that I might well pass on without citation. As it is, I snatch at the first that occurs to my mind.Madame1Bulletin de l'Union pour l'Action Morale, September, 1894.2B.

It is true that the thought of being drowned passed across my mind, but it cost no other sensation orreflection in me than this—that I felt quite contented and willing it were so, if it were my heavenly Father's choice.\" Sailing from Nice toGenoa, a storm keeps her eleven days at sea. \"As the irritated waves dashed round us,\" she writes, ''I could not help experiencing acertain degree of satisfaction in my mind. I pleased myself with thinking that those mutinous billows, under the command of Him whodoes all things rightly, might probably furnish me with a watery grave. Perhaps I carried the point too far, in the pleasure which I took inthus seeing myself beaten and bandied by the swelling waters. Those who were with me took notice of my intrepidity.\"1The contempt of danger which religious enthusiasm produces may be even more buoyant still. I take an example fromthat charming recent autobiography, \"With Christ at Sea,\" by Frank Bullen. A couple of days after he went throughthe conversion on shipboard of which he there gives an account,—\"It was blowing stiffly,\" he writes, \"and we were carrying1From THOMAS C.

Shortly after four bells we hauled down the flying-jib, and I sprang out astride theboom to furl it. I was sitting astride the boom when suddenly it gave way with me. The sail slipped through my fingers, and I fellbackwards, hanging head downwards over the seething tumult of shining foam under the ship's bows, suspended by one foot. But I feltonly high exultation in my certainty of eternal life. Although death was divided from me by a hair's breadth, and I was acutely consciousof the fact, it gave me no sensation but joy. I suppose I could have hung there no longer than five seconds, but in that time I lived a wholeage of delight. But my body asserted itself, and with a desperate gymnastic effort I regained the boom. How I furled the sail I don'tknow, but I sang at the utmost pitch of my voice praises to God that went pealing out over the dark waste of waters.\"1The annals of martyrdom are of course the signal field of triumph for religious imperturbability. Let me cite as anexample the statement of a humble sufferer, persecuted as a Huguenot under Louis XIV.:—\"They shut all the doors,\" Blanche Gamond writes, \"and I saw six women, each with a bunch of willow rods as thick as the hand couldhold, and a yard long. He gave me the order, 'Undress yourself,' which I did. He said, 'You are leaving on your shift; you must take it off.'They had so little patience that they took it off themselves, and I was naked from the waist up. They brought a cord with which they tiedme to a beam in the kitchen. They drew the cord tight with all their strength and asked me, 'Does it hurt you?' and then they dischargedtheir fury upon me, exclaiming as they struck me, 'Pray now to your God.' It was the Roulette woman who held this language. But at thismoment I received the greatest consolation that I can ever receive in my life, since I had the honor of being whipped for the name ofChrist, and in addition of being crowned with his mercy and his consolations. Why can I not write down the inconceivable influences,consolations, and peace1Op. cit., London, 1901, p. 130."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP265 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 26]Page 265which I felt interiorly? To understand them one must have passed by the same trial; they were so great that I was ravished, for therewhere afflictions abound grace is given superabundantly. In vain the women cried, 'We must double our blows; she does not feel them,for she neither speaks nor cries.' And how should I have cried, since I was swooning with happiness within?\"1The transition from tenseness, self-responsibility, and worry, to equanimity, receptivity, and peace, is the mostwonderful of all those shiftings of inner equilibrium, those changes of the personal centre of energy, which I haveanalyzed so often; and the chief wonder of it is that it so often comes about, not by doing, but by simply relaxing andthrowing the burden down. This abandonment of self-responsibility seems to be the fundamental act in specificallyreligious, as distinguished from moral practice. It antedates theologies and is independent of philosophies. Mind-cure,theosophy, stoicism, ordinary neurological hygiene, insist on it as emphatically as Christianity does, and it is capableof entering into closest marriage with every speculative creed.2 Christians who have it strongly live in what is called'recollection,' and are never anxious about the future, nor worry over the outcome of the day. Of Saint Catharine ofGenoa it is said that \"she took cognizance of things, only as they were presented to her in succession, moment bymoment.\" To her holy soul, \"the divine moment was the present moment, and when the present moment wasestimated in itself and in its relations, and when the duty that was involved in it was accomplished, it was permitted topass away as if it had never been, and to give way to the facts and duties of the moment which came after.\"3Hinduism, mind-cure, and theosophy all lay great emphasis upon this concentration of the consciousness upon themoment at hand.1CLAPARÈDE et GOTY: Deux Héroines de la Foi, Paris, 1880, p. 112.2Compare these three different statements of it: A.

The saintly person becomesexceedingly sensitive to inner inconsistency or discord, and mixture and confusion grow intolerable. All the mind'sobjects and occupations must be ordered with reference to the special spiritual excitement which is now its keynote.Whatever is unspiritual taints the pure water of the soul and is repugnant. Mixed with this exaltation of the moralsensibilities there is also an ardor of sacrifice, for the beloved deity's sake, of everything unworthy of him. Sometimesthe spiritual ardor is so sovereign that purity is achieved at a stroke—we have seen examples. Usually it is a moregradual conquest. Billy Bray's account of his abandonment of tobacco is a good example of the latter form ofachievement.\"I had been a smoker as well as a drunkard, and I used to love my tobacco as much as I loved my meat, and I would rather go down intothe mine without my dinner than without my pipe. In the days of old, the Lord spoke by the mouths of his servants, the prophets; now hespeaks to us by the spirit of his Son. I had not only the feeling part of religion, but I could hear the small, still voice within speaking tome. When I took the pipe to smoke, it would be applied within, 'It is an idol, a lust; worship the Lord with clean lips.' So, I felt it wasnot right to smoke. The Lord also sent a woman to convince me. I was one day in a house, and I took out my pipe to light it at the fire,and Mary Hawke—for that was the woman's name—said, 'Do you not feel it is wrong to smoke?' I said that I felt something insidetelling me that it was an idol, a lust, and she said that was the Lord. Then I said, 'Now, I must give it up, for the Lord is telling me of itinside, and the woman outside, so the tobacco must go, love it as I may.' There and then I took the tobacco out of my pocket, and threw itinto the fire, and put the pipe under my foot, 'ashes to ashes, dust to dust.' And I have not smoked since. I found it hard to break off oldhabits, but I cried to the Lord for help, and he gave me strength, for he has said, 'Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliverthee.' The day after I gave up smoking I had the toothache so bad that I"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP267 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 28]Page 267did not know what to do. I thought this was owing to giving up the pipe, but I said I would never smoke again, if I lost every tooth in myhead. I said, 'Lord, thou hast told us My yoke is easy and my burden is light,' and when I said that, all the pain left me. Sometimes thethought of the pipe would come back to me very strong; but the Lord strengthened me against the habit, and, bless his name, I have notsmoked since.\"Bray's biographer writes that after he had given up smoking, he thought that he would chew a little, but he conquered this dirty habit, too.\"On one occasion,\" Bray said, \"when at a prayer-meeting at Hicks Mill, I heard the Lord say to me, 'Worship me with clean lips.' So,when we got up from our knees, I took the quid out of my mouth and 'whipped 'en' [threw it] under the form. But, when we got on ourknees again, I put another quid into my mouth. Then the Lord said to me again, 'Worship me with clean lips.' So I took the quid out ofmy mouth, and whipped 'en under the form again, and said, 'Yes, Lord, I will.' From that time I gave up chewing as well as smoking, andhave been a free man.\"The ascetic forms which the impulse for veracity and purity of life may take are often pathetic enough. The earlyQuakers, for example, had hard battles to wage against the worldliness and insincerity of the ecclesiastical Christianityof their time. Yet the battle that cost them most wounds was probably that which they fought in defense of their ownright to social veracity and sincerity in their thee-ing and thou-ing, in not doffing the hat or giving titles of respect. Itwas laid on George Fox that these conventional customs were a lie and a sham, and the whole body of his followersthereupon renounced them, as a sacrifice to truth, and so that their acts and the spirit they professed might be more inaccord.\"When the Lord sent me into the world,\" says Fox in his Journal, \"he forbade me to put off my hat to any, high or low: and I wasrequired to 'thee' and 'thou' all men and women, without any respect to rich or poor, great or small. And as I traveled up and down, I wasnot to bid people Good-morning, or Good-evening, neither might I bow or"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP268 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 29]Page 268scrape with my leg to any one. This made the sects and professions rage. Oh! the rage that was in the priests, magistrates, professors, andpeople of all sorts: and especially in priests and professors: for though 'thou' to a single person was according to their accidence andgrammar rules, and according to the Bible, yet they could not bear to hear it: and because I could not put off my hat to them, it set themall into a rage. Oh! the scorn, heat, and fury that arose! Oh! the blows, punchings, beatings, and imprisonments that we underwent fornot putting off our hats to men! Some had their hats violently plucked off and thrown away, so that they quite lost them. The badlanguage and evil usage we received on this account is hard to be expressed, besides the danger we were sometimes in of losing our livesfor this matter, and that by the great professors of Christianity, who thereby discovered they were not true believers. And though it wasbut a small thing in the eye of man, yet a wonderful confusion it brought among all professors and priests: but, blessed be the Lord, manycame to see the vanity of that custom of putting off hats to men, and felt the weight of Truth's testimony against it.\"In the autobiography of Thomas Elwood, an early Quaker, who at one time was secretary to John Milton, we find anexquisitely quaint and candid account of the trials he underwent both at home and abroad, in following Fox's canonsof sincerity. The anecdotes are too lengthy for citation; but Elwood sets down his manner of feeling about these thingsin a shorter passage, which I will quote as a characteristic utterance of spiritual sensibility:—\"By this divine light, then,\" says Elwood, \"I saw that though I had not the evil of the common uncleanliness, debauchery, profaneness,and pollutions of the world to put away, because I had, through the great goodness of God and a civil education, been preserved out ofthose grosser evils, yet I had many other evils to put away and to cease from; some of which were not by the world, which lies inwickedness (1 John v. 19), accounted evils, but by the light of Christ were made manifest to me to be evils, and as such condemned inme."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP269 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 31]Page 269\"As particularly those fruits and effects of pride that discover themselves in the vanity and superfluity of apparel; which I took too muchdelight in. This evil of my doings I was required to put away and cease from; and judgment lay upon me till I did so.\"I took off from my apparel those unnecessary trimmings of lace, ribbons, and useless buttons, which had no real service, but were set ononly for that which was by mistake called ornament; and I ceased to wear rings.\"Again, the giving of flattering titles to men between whom and me there was not any relation to which such titles could be pretended tobelong. This was an evil I had been much addicted to, and was accounted a ready artist in; therefore this evil also was I required to putaway and cease from. So that thenceforward I durst not say, Sir, Master, My Lord, Madam (or My Dame); or say Your Servant to anyone to whom I did not stand in the real relation of a servant, which I had never done to any.\"Again, respect of persons, in uncovering the head and bowing the knee or body in salutation, was a practice I had been much in the useof; and this, being one of the vain customs of the world, introduced by the spirit of the world, instead of the true honor which this is afalse representation of, and used in deceit as a token of respect by persons one to another, who bear no real respect one to another; andbesides this, being a type and a proper emblem of that divine honor which all ought to pay to Almighty God, and which all of all sorts,who take upon them the Christian name, appear in when they offer their prayers to him, and therefore should not be given to men;—Ifound this to be one of those evils which I had been too long doing; therefore I was now required to put it away and cease from it.\"Again, the corrupt and unsound form of speaking in the plural number to a single person, you to one, instead of thou, contrary to thepure, plain, and single language of truth, thou to one, and you to more than one, which had always been used by God to men, and men toGod, as well as one to another, from the oldest record of time till corrupt men, for corrupt ends, in later and corrupt times, to flatter,fawn, and work upon the corrupt nature in men,"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP270 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 32]Page 270brought in that false and senseless way of speaking you to one, which has since corrupted the modern languages, and hath greatlydebased the spirits and depraved the manners of men;—this evil custom I had been as forward in as others, and this I was now called outof and required to cease from.\"These and many more evil customs which had sprung up in the night of darkness and general apostasy from the truth and true religionwere now, by the inshining of this pure ray of divine light in my conscience, gradually discovered to me to be what I ought to ceasefrom, shun, and stand a witness against.\"1These early Quakers were Puritans indeed. The slightest inconsistency between profession and deed jarred some ofthem to active protest. John Woolman writes in his diary:—\"In these journeys I have been where much cloth hath been dyed; and have at sundry times walked over ground where much of theirdyestuffs has drained away. This hath produced a longing in my mind that people might come into cleanness of spirit, cleanness ofperson, and cleanness about their houses and garments. Dyes being invented partly to please the eye, and partly to hide dirt, I have felt inthis weak state, when traveling in dirtiness, and affected with unwholesome scents, a strong desire that the nature of dyeing cloth to hidedirt may be more fully considered.\"Washing our garments to keep them sweet is cleanly, but it is the opposite to real cleanliness to hide dirt in them. Through giving wayto hiding dirt in our garments a spirit which would conceal that which is disagreeable is strengthened. Real cleanliness becometh a holypeople; but hiding that which is not clean by coloring our garments seems contrary to the sweetness of sincerity. Through some sorts ofdyes cloth is rendered less useful. And if the value of dyestuffs, and expense of dyeing, and the damage done to cloth, were all addedtogether, and that cost applied to keeping all sweet and clean, how much more would real cleanliness prevail.1The History of THOMAS ELWOOD, written by Himself, London, 1885, pp. 32 34."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP271 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 33]Page 271\"Thinking often on these things, the use of hats and garments dyed with a dye hurtful to them, and wearing more clothes in summer thanare useful, grew more uneasy to me; believing them to be customs which have not their foundation in pure wisdom. The apprehension ofbeing singular from my beloved friends was a strait upon me; and thus I continued in the use of some things, contrary to my judgment,about nine months. Then I thought of getting a hat the natural color of the fur, but the apprehension of being looked upon as one affectingsingularity felt uneasy to me. On this account I was under close exercise of mind in the time of our general spring meeting in 1762,greatly desiring to be rightly directed; when, being deeply bowed in spirit before the Lord, I was made willing to submit to what Iapprehended was required of me; and when I returned home, got a hat of the natural color of the fur.\"In attending meetings, this singularity was a trial to me, and more especially at this time, as white hats were used by some who werefond of following the changeable modes of dress, and as some friends, who knew not from what motives I wore it, grew shy of me, I feltmy way for a time shut up in the exercise of the ministry. Some friends were apprehensive that my wearing such a hat savored of anaffected singularity: those who spoke with me in a friendly way, I generally informed in a few words, that I believed my wearing it wasnot in my own will.\"When the craving for moral consistency and purity is developed to this degree, the subject may well find the outerworld too full of shocks to dwell in, and can unify his life and keep his soul unspotted only by withdrawing from it.That law which impels the artist to achieve harmony in his composition by simply dropping out whatever jars, orsuggests a discord, rules also in the spiritual life. To omit, says Stevenson, is the one art in literature: \"If I knew howto omit, I should ask no other knowledge.\" And life, when full of disorder and slackness and vague superfluity, can nomore have what we call character than literature can have it under similar conditions. So monasteries and communitiesof sympathetic devotees open their doors, and in their changeless order,"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP272 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 34]Page 272characterized by omissions quite as much as constituted of actions, the holy-minded person finds that innersmoothness and cleanness which it is torture to him to feel violated at every turn by the discordancy and brutality ofsecular existence.That the scrupulosity of purity may be carried to a fantastic extreme must be admitted. In this it resemblesAsceticism, to which further symptom of saintliness we had better turn next. The adjective 'ascetic' is applied toconduct originating on diverse psychological levels, which I might as well begin by distinguishing from one another.1. Asceticism may be a mere expression of organic hardihood, disgusted with too much ease.2. Temperance in meat and drink, simplicity of apparel, chastity, and non-pampering of the body generally, may befruits of the love of purity, shocked by whatever savors of the sensual.3. They may also be fruits of love, that is, they may appeal to the subject in the light of sacrifices which he is happy inmaking to the Deity whom he acknowledges.4. Again, ascetic mortifications and torments may be due to pessimistic feelings about the self, combined withtheological beliefs concerning expiation. The devotee may feel that he is buying himself free, or escaping worsesufferings hereafter, by doing penance now.5. In psychopathic persons, mortifications may be entered on irrationally, by a sort of obsession or fixed idea whichcomes as a challenge and must be worked off, because only thus does the subject get his interior consciousnessfeeling right again.6. Finally, ascetic exercises may in rarer instances be prompted by genuine perversions of the bodily sensibility, inconsequence of which normally pain-giving stimuli are actually felt as pleasures.I will try to give an instance under each of these heads in turn; but it is not easy to get them pure, for in casespronounced enough to be immediately classed as ascetic, several of the assigned motives usually work together.Moreover,"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP273 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 35]Page 273before citing any examples at all, I must invite you to some general psychological considerations which apply to all ofthem alike.A strange moral transformation has within the past century swept over our Western world. We no longer think that weare called on to face physical pain with equanimity. It is not expected of a man that he should either endure it or inflictmuch of it, and to listen to the recital of cases of it makes our flesh creep morally as well as physically. The way inwhich our ancestors looked upon pain as an eternal ingredient of the world's order, and both caused and suffered it asa matter-of-course portion of their day's work, fills us with amazement. We wonder that any human beings could havebeen so callous. The result of this historic alteration is that even in the Mother Church herself, where asceticdiscipline has such a fixed traditional prestige as a factor of merit, it has largely come into desuetude, if not discredit.A believer who flagellates or 'macerates' himself to-day arouses more wonder and fear than emulation. Many Catholicwriters who admit that the times have changed in this respect do so resignedly; and even add that perhaps it is as wellnot to waste feelings in regretting the matter, for to return to the heroic corporeal discipline of ancient days might bean extravagance.Where to seek the easy and the pleasant seems instinctive— and instinctive it appears to be in man; any deliberatetendency to pursue the hard and painful as such and for their own sakes might well strike one as purely abnormal.Nevertheless, in moderate degrees it is natural and even usual to human nature to court the arduous. It is only theextreme manifestations of the tendency that can be regarded as a paradox.The psychological reasons for this lie near the surface. When we drop abstractions and take what we call our will inthe act, we see that it is a very complex function. It involves both stimulations and inhibitions; it follows generalizedhabits; it is escorted by reflective criticisms; and it leaves a good or a bad taste of itself behind, according to themanner of the performance. The result is that, quite apart from the immediate pleasure which any sensible experiencemay give us, our own general moral attitude in procuring or undergoing the"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP274 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 37]Page 274experience brings with it a secondary satisfaction or distaste. Some men and women, indeed, there are who can live onsmiles and the word 'yes' forever. But for others (indeed for most), this is too tepid and relaxed a moral climate.Passive happiness is slack and insipid, and soon grows mawkish and intolerable. Some austerity and wintry negativity,some roughness, danger, stringency, and effort, some 'no! no!' must be mixed in, to produce the sense of an existencewith character and texture and power. The range of individual differences in this respect is enormous; but whateverthe mixture of yeses and noes may be, the person is infallibly aware when he has struck it in the right proportion forhim. This, he feels, is my proper vocation, this is the optimum, the law, the life for me to live. Here I find the degreeof equilibrium, safety, calm, and leisure which I need, or here I find the challenge, passion, fight, and hardshipwithout which my soul's energy expires.Every individual soul, in short, like every individual machine or organism, has its own best conditions of efficiency. Agiven machine will run best under a certain steam-pressure, a certain amperage; an organism under a certain diet,weight, or exercise. You seem to do best, I heard a doctor say to a patient, at about 140 millimeters of arterial tension.And it is just so with our sundry souls: some are happiest in calm weather; some need the sense of tension, of strongvolition, to make them feel alive and well. For these latter souls, whatever is gained from day to day must be paid forby sacrifice and inhibition, or else it comes too cheap and has no zest.Now when characters of this latter sort become religious, they are apt to turn the edge of their need of effort andnegativity against their natural self; and the ascetic life gets evolved as a consequence.When Professor Tyndall in one of his lectures tells us that Thomas Carlyle put him into his bath-tub every morning ofa freezing Berlin winter, he proclaimed one of the lowest grades of asceticism. Even without Carlyle, most of us findit necessary to our soul's health to start the day with a rather cool immersion. A little farther along the scale we getsuch statements as this, from one of my correspondents, an agnostic:—"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP275 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 38]Page 275''Often at night in my warm bed I would feel ashamed to depend so on the warmth, and whenever the thought would come over me Iwould have to get up, no matter what time of night it was, and stand for a minute in the cold, just so as to prove my manhood.\"Such cases as these belong simply to our head 1. In the next case we probably have a mixture of heads 2 and 3—theasceticism becomes far more systematic and pronounced. The writer is a Protestant, whose sense of moral energycould doubtless be gratified on no lower terms, and I take his case from Starbuck's manuscript collection.\"I practiced fasting and mortification of the flesh. I secretly made burlap shirts, and put the burrs next the skin, and wore pebbles in myshoes. I would spend nights flat on my back on the floor without any covering.\"The Roman Church has organized and codified all this sort of thing, and given it a market-value in the shape of'merit.' But we see the cultivation of hardship cropping out under every sky and in every faith, as a spontaneous needof character. Thus we read of Channing, when first settled as a Unitarian minister, that—\"He was now more simple than ever, and seemed to have become incapable of any form of self-indulgence. He took the smallest room inthe house for his study, though he might easily have commanded one more light, airy, and in every way more suitable; and chose for hissleeping chamber an attic which he shared with a younger brother. The furniture of the latter might have answered for the cell of ananchorite, and consisted of a hard mattress on a cotbedstead, plain wooden chairs and table, with matting on the floor. It was without fire,and to cold he was throughout life extremely sensitive; but he never complained or appeared in any way to be conscious ofinconvenience. 'I recollect,' says his brother, 'after one most severe night, that in the morning he sportively thus alluded to his suffering:\"If my bed were my country, I should be somewhat like Bonaparte: I have no control except over the part which I occupy; the instant Imove, frost takes possession.\"' In"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP276 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 44]Page 276sickness only would he change for the time his apartment and accept a few comforts. The dress too that he habitually adopted was ofmost inferior quality; and garments were constantly worn which the world would call mean, though an almost feminine neatnesspreserved him from the least appearance of neglect.\"1Channing's asceticism, such as it was, was evidently a compound of hardihood and love of purity. The democracywhich is an offshoot of the enthusiasm of humanity, and of which I will speak later under the head of the cult ofpoverty, doubtless bore also a share. Certainly there was no pessimistic element in his case. In the next case we have astrongly pessimistic element, so that it belongs under head 4. John Cennick was Methodism's first lay preacher. In1735 he was convicted of sin, while walking in Cheapside,—\"And at once left off song-singing, card-playing, and attending theatres. Sometimes he wished to go to a popish monastery, to spend hislife in devout retirement. At other times he longed to live in a cave, sleeping on fallen leaves, and feeding on forest fruits. He fasted longand often, and prayed nine times a day. Fancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so great a sinner as himself, he began to feed onpotatoes, acorns, crabs, and grass; and often wished that he could live on roots and herbs. At length, in 1737, he found peace with God,and went on his way rejoicing.\"2In this poor man we have morbid melancholy and fear, and the sacrifices made are to purge out sin, and to buy safety.The hopelessness of Christian theology in respect of the flesh and the natural man generally has, in systematizing fear,made of it one tremendous incentive to self-mortification. It would be quite unfair, however, in spite of the fact thatthis incentive has often been worked in a mercenary way for hortatory purposes, to call it a mercenary incentive. Theimpulse to expiate and do penance is, in its first intention, far too immediate and spontaneous an expression of self-despair and1Memoirs of W. E. Channing, Boston, 1840, i. 196.2L.

John Wesley, i. 274."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP277 hl[01 03 2011 00 28 45]Page 277anxiety to be obnoxious to any such reproach. In the form of loving sacrifice, of spending all we have to show ourdevotion, ascetic discipline of the severest sort may be the fruit of highly optimistic religious feeling.M. Vianney, the curé of Ars, was a French country priest, whose holiness was exemplary. We read in his life thefollowing account of his inner need of sacrifice:—\"'On this path,' M. Vianney said, 'it is only the first step that costs. There is in mortification a balm and a savor without which one cannotlive when once one has made their acquaintance. There is but one way in which to give one's self to God,—that is, to give one's selfentirely, and to keep nothing for one's self. The little that one keeps is only good to trouble one and make one suffer.' Accordingly heimposed it on himself that he should never smell a flower, never drink when parched with thirst, never drive away a fly, never showdisgust before a repugnant object, never complain of anything that had to do with his personal comfort, never sit down, never lean uponhis elbows when he was kneeling. The Curé of Ars was very sensitive to cold, but he would never take means to protect himself againstit. During a very severe winter, one of his missionaries contrived a false floor to his confessional and placed a metal case of hot waterbeneath. The trick succeeded, and the Saint was deceived: 'God is very good,' he said with emotion. 'This year, through all the cold, myfeet have always been warm.'\"1In this case the spontaneous impulse to make sacrifices for the pure love of God was probably the uppermostconscious motive. We may class it, then, under our head 3. Some authors think that the impulse to sacrifice is themain religious phenomenon. It is a prominent, a universal phenomenon certainly, and lies deeper than any specialcreed. Here, for instance, is what seems to be a spontaneous example of it, simply expressing what seemed right at thetime between the individual and his Maker. Cotton Mather, the New England Puritan divine, is generally reputed arather grotesque pedant;1A. MONNIN: Le Curé d'Ars, Vie de M. J. B. M.

So,two hours before my lovely consort expired, I kneeled by her bedside, and I took into my two hands a dear hand, the dearest in the world.With her thus in my hands, I solemnly and sincerely gave her up unto the Lord: and in token of my real Resignation, I gently put her outof my hands, and laid away a most lovely hand, resolving that I would never touch it more. This was the hardest, and perhaps the bravestaction that ever I did. She told me that she signed and sealed my act of resignation. And though before that she called for mecontinually, she after this never asked for me any more.\"1Father Vianney's asceticism taken in its totality was simply the result of a permanent flood of high spiritualenthusiasm, longing to make proof of itself. The Roman Church has, in its incomparable fashion, collected all themotives towards asceticism together, and so codified them that any one wishing to pursue Christian perfection mayfind a practical system mapped out for him in any one of a number of ready-made manuals.2 The dominant Churchnotion of perfection is of course the negative one of avoidance of sin. Sin proceeds from concupiscence, andconcupiscence from our carnal passions and temptations, chief of which are pride, sensuality in all its forms, and theloves of worldly excitement and possession. All these sources of sin must be resisted; and discipline and austeritiesare a most efficacious mode of meeting them. Hence there are always in these books chapters on self-mortification.But whenever a procedure is codified, the more delicate spirit of it evaporates, and if we wish the undiluted asceticspirit,—the passion of self-contempt wreaking itself on the poor flesh, the divine irrationality of devotion making1B.

If anything agreeable offersitself to your senses, yet does not at the same time tend purely to the honor and glory of God, renounce it and separate yourself from itfor the love of Christ, who all his life long had no other taste or wish than to do the will of his Father whom he called his meat andnourishment. For example, you take satisfaction in hearing of things in which the glory of God bears no part. Deny yourself thissatisfaction, mortify your wish to listen. You take pleasure in seeing objects which do not raise your mind to God: refuse yourself thispleasure, and turn away your eyes. The same with conversations and all other things. Act similarly, so far as you are able, with all theoperations of the senses, striving to make yourself free from their yokes.\"The radical remedy lies in the mortification of the four great natural passions, joy, hope, fear, and grief. You must seek to deprive theseof every satisfaction and leave them as it were in darkness and the void. Let your soul therefore turn always:\"Not to what is most easy, but to what is hardest;\"Not to what tastes best, but to what is most distasteful;\"Not to what most pleases, but to what disgusts;\"Not to matter of consolation, but to matter for desolation rather;\"Not to rest, but to labor;\"Not to desire the more, but the less;\"Not to aspire to what is highest and most precious, but to what is lowest and most contemptible;\"Not to will anything, but to will nothing;\"Not to seek the best in everything, but to seek the worst, so that you may enter for the love of Christ into a"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP280 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 00]Page 280complete destitution, a perfect poverty of spirit, and an absolute renunciation of everything in this world.\"Embrace these practices with all the energy of your soul and you will find in a short time great delights and unspeakable consolations.\"Despise yourself, and wish that others should despise you.\"Speak to your own disadvantage, and desire others to do the same;\"Conceive a low opinion of yourself, and find it good when others hold the same;\"To enjoy the taste of all things, have no taste for anything.\"To know all things, learn to know nothing.\"To possess all things, resolve to possess nothing.\"To be all things, be willing to be nothing.\"To get to where you have no taste for anything, go through whatever experiences you have no taste for.\"To learn to know nothing, go whither you are ignorant.\"To reach what you possess not, go whithersoever you own nothing.\"To be what you are not, experience what you are not.\"These later verses play with that vertigo of self-contradiction which is so dear to mysticism. Those that come next arecompletely mystical, for in them Saint John passes from God to the more metaphysical notion of the All.\"When you stop at one thing, you cease to open yourself to the All.\"For to come to the All you must give up the All.\"And if you should attain to owning the All, you must own it, desiring Nothing.\"In this spoliation, the soul finds its tranquillity and rest.

Suso, you will remember, was one of the fourteenth century German mystics; his autobiography,written in the third person, is a classic religious document.\"He was in his youth of a temperament full of fire and life; and when this began to make itself felt, it was very grievous to him; and hesought by many devices how he might bring his body into subjection. He wore for a long time a hair shirt and an iron chain, until theblood ran from him, so that he was obliged to leave them off. He secretly caused an undergarment to be made for him; and in theundergarment he had strips of leather fixed, into which a hundred and fifty brass nails, pointed and filed sharp, were driven, and thepoints of the nails were always turned towards the flesh. He had this garment made very tight, and so arranged as to go round him andfasten in front, in order that it might fit the closer to his body, and the pointed nails might be driven into his flesh; and it was highenough to reach upwards to his navel. In this he used to sleep at night. Now in summer, when it was hot, and he was very tired and illfrom his journeyings, or when he held the office of lecturer, he would sometimes, as he lay thus in bonds, and oppressed with toil, andtormented also by noxious insects, cry aloud and give way to fretfulness, and twist round and round in agony, as a worm does when runthrough with a pointed needle. It often seemed to him as if he were lying upon an ant-hill, from the torture caused by the insects; for if hewished to sleep, or when he had fallen asleep, they vied with one another.1 Sometimes he cried to Almighty God in the fullness of hisheart: Alas!1'Insects,' i. e. lice, were an unfailing token of mediæval sainthood. We read of Francis of Assisi's sheepskin that \"often a companion ofthe saint would take it to the fire to clean and dispediculate it, doing so, as he said, because the seraphic father himself was no enemy ofpidocchi, but on the contrary kept them on him (le portava adosso), and held it for an honor and a glory to wear these celestial pearls inhis habit.\" Quoted by P. SABATIER: Speculum Perfectionis, etc., Paris, 1898, p. 231, note."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP282 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 04]Page 282Gentle God, what a dying is this! When a man is killed by murderers or strong beasts of prey it is soon over; but I lie dying here underthe cruel insects, and yet cannot die. The nights in winter were never so long, nor was the summer so hot, as to make him leave off thisexercise. On the contrary, he devised something farther—two leathern loops into which he put his hands, and fastened one on each sidehis throat, and made the fastenings so secure that even if his cell had been on fire about him, he could not have helped himself. This hecontinued until his hands and arms had become almost tremulous with the strain, and then he devised something else: two leather gloves;and he caused a brazier to fit them all over with sharp-pointed brass tacks, and he used to put them on at night, in order that if he shouldtry while asleep to throw off the hair undergarment, or relieve himself from the gnawings of the vile insects, the tacks might then stickinto his body. And so it came to pass. If ever he sought to help himself with his hands in his sleep, he drove the sharp tacks into hisbreast, and tore himself, so that his flesh festered. When after many weeks the wounds had healed, he tore himself again and made freshwounds.\"He continued this tormenting exercise for about sixteen years. At the end of this time, when his blood was now chilled, and the fire ofhis temperament destroyed, there appeared to him in a vision on Whitsunday, a messenger from heaven, who told him that God requiredthis of him no longer. Whereupon he discontinued it, and threw all these things away into a running stream.\"Suso then tells how, to emulate the sorrows of his crucified Lord, he made himself a cross with thirty protruding iron needles and nails.This he bore on his bare back between his shoulders day and night. \"The first time that he stretched out this cross upon his back histender frame was struck with terror at it, and he blunted the sharp nails slightly against a stone. But soon, repenting of this womanlycowardice, he pointed them all again with a file, and placed once more the cross upon him. It made his back, where the bones are, bloodyand seared. Whenever he sat down or stood up, it was as if a hedgehog-skin were on"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP283 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 05]Page 283him. If any one touched him unawares, or pushed against his clothes, it tore him.\"Suso next tells of his penitences by means of striking this cross and forcing the nails deeper into the flesh, and likewise of his self-scourgings,—a dreadful story,—and then goes on as follows: \"At this same period the Servitor procured an old castaway door, and heused to lie upon it at night without any bedclothes to make him comfortable, except that he took off his shoes and wrapped a thick cloakround him. He thus secured for himself a most miserable bed; for hard pea-stalks lay in humps under his head, the cross with the sharpnails stuck into his back, his arms were locked fast in bonds, the horsehair undergarment was round his loins, and the cloak too washeavy and the door hard. Thus he lay in wretchedness, afraid to stir, just like a log, and he would send up many a sigh to God.\"In winter he suffered very much from the frost. If he stretched out his feet they lay bare on the floor and froze, if he gathered them upthe blood became all on fire in his legs, and this was great pain. His feet were full of sores, his legs dropsical, his knees bloody andseared, his loins covered with scars from the horsehair, his body wasted, his mouth parched with intense thirst, and his hands tremulousfrom weakness. Amid these torments he spent his nights and days; and he endured them all out of the greatness of the love which he borein his heart to the Divine and Eternal Wisdom, our Lord Jesus Christ, whose agonizing sufferings he sought to imitate. After a time hegave up this penitential exercise of the door, and instead of it he took up his abode in a very small cell, and used the bench, which was sonarrow and short that he could not stretch himself upon it, as his bed. In this hole, or upon the door, he lay at night in his usual bonds, forabout eight years. It was also his custom, during the space of twenty-five years, provided he was staying in the convent, never to go aftercompline in winter into any warm room, or to the convent stove to warm himself, no matter how cold it might be, unless he was obligedto do so for other reasons. Throughout all these years he never took a bath, either a water or a sweating bath; and this he did in order tomortify his"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP284 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 07]Page 284comfort-seeking body. He practiced during a long time such rigid poverty that he would neither receive nor touch a penny, either withleave or without it. For a considerable time he strove to attain such a high degree of purity that he would neither scratch nor touch anypart of his body, save only his hands and feet.\"1I spare you the recital of poor Suso's self-inflicted tortures from thirst. It is pleasant to know that after his fortiethyear, God showed him by a series of visions that he had sufficiently broken down the natural man, and that he mightleave these exercises off. His case is distinctly pathological, but he does not seem to have had the alleviation, whichsome ascetics have enjoyed, of an alteration of sensibility capable of actually turning torment into a perverse kind ofpleasure. Of the founder of the Sacred Heart order, for example, we read that\"Her love of pain and suffering was insatiable. She said that she could cheerfully live till the day of judgement, provided she mightalways have matter for suffering for God; but that to live a single day without suffering would be intolerable. She said again that she wasdevoured with two unassuageable fevers, one for the holy communion, the other for suffering, humiliation, and annihilation. 'Nothing butpain,' she continually said in her letters, 'makes my life supportable.'\"2So much for the phenomena to which the ascetic impulse will in certain persons give rise. In the ecclesiasticallyconsecrated character three minor branches of self-mortification have been recognized as indispensable pathways toperfection. I refer to the chastity, obedience, and poverty which the monk vows to observe; and upon the heads ofobedience and poverty I will make a few remarks.First, of Obedience. The secular life of our twentieth century opens with this virtue held in no high esteem. The duty1The Life of the Blessed HENRY SUSO, by Himself, translated by T. F. KNOX, London, 1865, pp. 56 80, abridged.2BOUGAUD: Hist. de la bienheureuse Marguerite Marie, Paris, 1894, pp. 265, 171.

So much so that it is difficult even imaginatively tocomprehend how men possessed of an inner life of their own could ever have come to think the subjection of its willto that of other finite creatures recommendable. I confess that to myself it seems something of a mystery. Yet itevidently corresponds to a profound interior need of many persons, and we must do our best to understand it.On the lowest possible plane, one sees how the expediency of obedience in a firm ecclesiastical organization musthave led to its being viewed as meritorious. Next, experience shows that there are times in every one's life when onecan be better counseled by others than by one's self. Inability to decide is one of the commonest symptoms of fatiguednerves; friends who see our troubles more broadly, often see them more wisely than we do; so it is frequently an act ofexcellent virtue to consult and obey a doctor, a partner, or a wife. But, leaving these lower prudential regions, wefind, in the nature of some of the spiritual excitements which we have been studying, good reasons for idealizingobedience. Obedience may spring from the general religious phenomenon of inner softening and self-surrender andthrowing one's self on higher powers. So saving are these attitudes felt to be that in themselves, apart from utility, theybecome ideally consecrated; and in obeying a man whose fallibility we see through thoroughly, we, nevertheless, mayfeel much as we do when we resign our will to that of infinite wisdom. Add self-despair and the passion of self-crucifixion to this, and obedience becomes an ascetic sacrifice, agreeable quite irrespective of whatever prudentialuses it might have.It is as a sacrifice, a mode of 'mortification,' that obedience is primarily conceived by Catholic writers, a ''sacrificewhich man offers to God, and of which he is himself both the priest and the victim. By poverty he immolates hisexterior possessions; by chastity he immolates his body; by obedience he completes the sacrifice, and gives to God allthat he yet holds as his own, his two most precious goods, his intellect and his will. The sacrifice is then complete andunreserved, a genuine"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP286 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 10]Page 286holocaust, for the entire victim is now consumed for the honor of God.\"1 Accordingly, in Catholic discipline, we obeyour superior not as mere man, but as the representative of Christ. Obeying God in him by our intention, obedience iseasy. But when the text-book theologians marshal collectively all their reasons for recommending it, the mixturesounds to our ears rather odd.\"One of the great consolations of the monastic life,\" says a Jesuit authority, \"is the assurance we have that in obeying we can commit nofault. The Superior may commit a fault in commanding you to do this thing or that, but you are certain that you commit no fault so longas you obey, because God will only ask you if you have duly performed what orders you received, and if you can furnish a clear accountin that respect, you are absolved entirely. Whether the things you did were opportune, or whether there were not something better thatmight have been done, these are questions not asked of you, but rather of your Superior. The moment what you did was done obediently,God wipes it out of your account, and charges it to the Superior. So that Saint Jerome well exclaimed, in celebrating the advantages ofobedience, 'Oh, sovereign liberty! Oh, holy and blessed security by which one becomes almost impeccable!'\"Saint John Climachus is of the same sentiment when he calls obedience an excuse before God. In fact, when God asks why you havedone this or that, and you reply, it is because I was so ordered by my Superiors, God will ask for no other excuse. As a passenger in agood vessel with a good pilot need give himself no farther concern, but may go to sleep in peace, because the pilot has charge over all,and 'watches for him'; so a religious person who lives under the yoke of obedience goes to heaven as if while sleeping, that is, whileleaning entirely on the conduct of his Superiors, who are the pilots of his vessel, and keep watch for him continually. It is no small thing,of a truth, to be able to cross the stormy sea of life on the shoulders and in1LEJEUNE: Introduction à la Vie Mystique, 1899, p. 277.

Their Superior bears alltheir burdens. A certain grave doctor said that he would rather spend his life in picking up straws by obedience, than by his ownresponsible choice busy himself with the loftiest works of charity, because one is certain of following the will of God in whatever onemay do from obedience, but never certain in the same degree of anything which we may do of our own proper movement.\"1One should read the letters in which Ignatius Loyola recommends obedience as the backbone of his order, if onewould gain insight into the full spirit of its cult.2 They are too long to quote; but Ignatius's belief is so vividlyexpressed in a couple of sayings reported by companions that, though they have been so often cited, I will ask yourpermission to copy them once more:—\"I ought,\" an early biographer reports him as saying, \"on entering religion, and thereafter, to place myself entirely in the hands of God,and of him who takes His place by His authority. I ought to desire that my Superior should oblige me to give up my own judgment, andconquer my own mind. I ought to set up no difference between one Superior and another, but recognize them all as equal before God,whose place they fill. For if I distinguish persons, I weaken the spirit of obedience. In the hands of my Superior, I must be a soft wax, athing, from which he is to require whatever pleases him, be it to write or receive letters, to speak or not to speak to such a person, or thelike; and I must put all my fervor in executing zealously and exactly what I am ordered. I must consider myself as a corpse which hasneither intelligence nor will; be like a mass of matter which without resistance lets itself be placed wherever it may please any one; like astick in the hand of an old man, who uses it according to his needs and places1ALFONSO RODRIGUEZ, S. J.: Pratique de la Perfection Chrétienne, Part iii., Treatise v., ch. x.2Letters li. and cxx. of the collection translated into French by BOUIX, Paris, 1870."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP288 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 13]Page 288it where it suits him. So must I be under the hands of the Order, to serve it in the way it judges most useful.\"I must never ask of the Superior to be sent to a particular place, to be employed in a particular duty. I must consider nothing asbelonging to me personally, and as regards the things I use, be like a statue which lets itself be stripped and never opposes resistance.\"1The other saying is reported by Rodriguez in the chapter from which I a moment ago made quotations. Whenspeaking of the Pope's authority, Rodriguez writes:—\"Saint Ignatius said, when general of his company, that if the Holy Father were to order him to set sail in the first bark which he mightfind in the port of Ostia, near Rome, and to abandon himself to the sea, without a mast, without sails, without oars or rudder or any of thethings that are needful for navigation or subsistence, he would obey not only with alacrity, but without anxiety or repugnance, and evenwith a great internal satisfaction.\"2With a solitary concrete example of the extravagance to which the virtue we are considering has been carried, I willpass to the topic next in order.\"Sister Marie Claire [of Port Royal] had been greatly imbued with the holiness and excellence of M. de Langres. This prelate, soon afterhe came to Port Royal, said to her one day, seeing her so tenderly attached to Mother Angélique, that it would perhaps be better not tospeak to her again. Marie Claire, greedy of obedience, took this inconsiderate word for an oracle of God, and from that day forwardremained for several years without once speaking to her sister.\"3Our next topic shall be Poverty, felt at all times and under all creeds as one adornment of a saintly life. Since theinstinct of ownership is fundamental in man's nature, this is one more example of the ascetic paradox. Yet it appearsno paradox at1BARTOLI-MICHEL, ii. 13.2RODRIGUEZ: Op. cit., Part iii., Treatise v., ch. vi.3SAINTE-BEUVE: Histoire de Port Royal, i. 346."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP289 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 20]Page 289all, but perfectly reasonable, the moment one recollects how easily higher excitements hold lower cupidities in check.Having just quoted the Jesuit Rodriguez on the subject of obedience, I will, to give immediately a concrete turn to ourdiscussion of poverty, also read you a page from his chapter on this latter virtue. You must remember that he iswriting instructions for monks of his own order, and bases them all on the text, \"Blessed are the poor in spirit.\"\"If any one of you,\" he says, \"will know whether or not he is really poor in spirit, let him consider whether he loves the ordinaryconsequences and effects of poverty, which are hunger, thirst, cold, fatigue, and the denudation of all conveniences. See if you are glad towear a worn-out habit full of patches. See if you are glad when something is lacking to your meal, when you are passed by in serving it,when what you receive is distasteful to you, when your cell is out of repair. If you are not glad of these things, if instead of loving themyou avoid them, then there is proof that you have not attained the perfection of poverty of spirit.\" Rodriguez then goes on to describe thepractice of poverty in more detail. \"The first point is that which Saint Ignatius proposes in his constitutions, when he says, 'Let no oneuse anything as if it were his private possession.' 'A religious person,' he says, 'ought in respect to all the things that he uses, to be like astatue which one may drape with clothing, but which feels no grief and makes no resistance when one strips it again. It is in this way thatyou should feel towards your clothes, your books, your cell, and everything else that you make use of; if ordered to quit them, or toexchange them for others, have no more sorrow than if you were a statue being uncovered. In this way you will avoid using them as ifthey were your private possession. But if, when you give up your cell, or yield possession of this or that object or exchange it for another,you feel repugnance and are not like a statue, that shows that you view these things as if they were your private property.'\"And this is why our holy founder wished the superiors to test their monks somewhat as God tested Abraham, and to put their povertyand their obedience to trial, that by"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP290 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 21]Page 290this means they may become acquainted with the degree of their virtue, and gain a chance to make ever farther progress in perfection, making the one move out of his room when he finds it comfortable and is attached to it; taking away from another a book of which he isfond; or obliging a third to exchange his garment for a worse one. Otherwise we should end by acquiring a species of property in allthese several objects, and little by little the wall of poverty that surrounds us and constitutes our principal defense would be thrown down.The ancient fathers of the desert used often thus to treat their companions. Saint Dositheus, being sick-nurse, desired a certain knife, andasked Saint Dorotheus for it, not for his private use, but for employment in the infirmary of which he had charge. Whereupon SaintDorotheus answered him: 'Ha! Dositheus, so that knife pleases you so much! Will you be the slave of a knife or the slave of Jesus Christ?Do you not blush with shame at wishing that a knife should be your master? I will not let you touch it.' Which reproach and refusal hadsuch an effect upon the holy disciple that since that time he never touched the knife again.\" \"Therefore, in our rooms,\" Father Rodriguez continues, \"there must be no other furniture than a bed, a table, a bench, and a candlestick,things purely necessary, and nothing more. It is not allowed among us that our cells should be ornamented with pictures or aught else,neither armchairs, carpets, curtains, nor any sort of cabinet or bureau of any elegance. Neither is it allowed us to keep anything to eat,either for ourselves or for those who may come to visit us. We must ask permission to go to the refectory even for a glass of water; andfinally we may not keep a book in which we can write a line, or which we may take away with us. One cannot deny that thus we are ingreat poverty. But this poverty is at the same time a great repose and a great perfection. For it would be inevitable, in case a religiousperson were allowed to own superfluous possessions, that these things would greatly occupy his mind, be it to acquire them, to preservethem, or to increase them; so that in not permitting us at all to own them, all these inconveniences are remedied. Among the various goodreasons why the"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP291 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 34]Page 291company forbids secular persons to enter our cells, the principal one is that thus we may the easier be kept in poverty. After all, we areall men, and if we were to receive people of the world into our rooms, we should not have the strength to remain within the boundsprescribed, but should at least wish to adorn them with some books to give the visitors a better opinion of our scholarship.\"1Since Hindu fakirs, Buddhist monks, and Mohammedan dervishes unite with Jesuits and Franciscans in idealizingpoverty as the loftiest individual state, it is worth while to examine into the spiritual grounds for such a seeminglyunnatural opinion. And first, of those which lie closest to common human nature.The opposition between the men who have and the men who are is immemorial. Though the gentleman, in the old-fashioned sense of the man who is well born, has usually in point of fact been predaceous and reveled in lands andgoods, yet he has never identified his essence with these possessions, but rather with the personal superiorities, thecourage, generosity, and pride supposed to be his birthright. To certain huckstering kinds of consideration he thankedGod he was forever inaccessible, and if in life's vicissitudes he should become destitute through their lack, he wasglad to think that with his sheer valor he was all the freer to work out his salvation. \"Wer nur selbst was hätte,\" saysLessing's Tempelherr, in Nathan the Wise, \"mein Gott, mein Gott, ich habe nichts!\" This ideal of the well-born manwithout possessions was embodied in knight-errantry and templardom; and, hideously corrupted as it has always been,it still dominates sentimentally, if not practically, the military and aristocratic view of life. We glorify the soldier asthe man absolutely unincumbered. Owning nothing but his bare life, and willing to toss that up at any moment whenthe cause commands him, he is the representative of unhampered freedom in ideal directions. The laborer who payswith his person day by day, and has no rights invested in the future, offers also much of this ideal detachment.

My heart echoes back, 'Lord Jesus, help me to do or suffer thy will. When thou seest me indanger of nestling,—in pity—in tender pity,—put a thorn in my nest to prevent me from it.'\"1The loathing of 'capital' with which our laboring classes today are growing more and more infected seems largelycomposed of this sound sentiment of antipathy for lives based on mere having. As an anarchist poet writes:—\"Not by accumulating riches, but by giving away that which you have,\"Shall you become beautiful;\"You must undo the wrappings, not case yourself in fresh ones;\"Not by multiplying clothes shall you make your body sound and healthy, but rather by discarding them \"For a soldier who is going on a campaign does not seek what fresh furniture he can carry on his back, but ratherwhat he can leave behind;\"Knowing well that every additional thing which he cannot freely use and handle is an impediment.\"2In short, lives based on having are less free than lives based either on doing or on being, and in the interest of actionpeople subject to spiritual excitement throw away possessions as so many clogs. Only those who have no privateinterests can follow an ideal straight away. Sloth and cowardice creep in with every dollar or guinea we have to guard.When a1R.

And thenceforward he denied all suchrequests, saying: A man possesses of learning only so much as comes out of him in action, and a monk is a goodpreacher only so far as his deeds proclaim him such, for every tree is known by its fruits.''1But beyond this more worthily athletic attitude involved in doing and being, there is, in the desire of not having,something profounder still, something related to that fundamental mystery of religious experience, the satisfactionfound in absolute surrender to the larger power. So long as any secular safeguard is retained, so long as any residualprudential guarantee is clung to, so long the surrender is incomplete, the vital crisis is not passed, fear still standssentinel, and mistrust of the divine obtains: we hold by two anchors, looking to God, it is true, after a fashion, but alsoholding by our proper machinations. In certain medical experiences we have the same critical point to overcome. Adrunkard, or a morphine or cocaine maniac, offers himself to be cured. He appeals to the doctor to wean him from hisenemy, but he dares not face blank abstinence. The tyrannical drug is still an anchor to windward: he hides supplies ofit among his clothing; arranges secretly to have it smuggled in in case of need. Even so an incompletely regenerateman still trusts in his own expedients. His money is like the sleeping potion which the chronically wakeful patientkeeps beside his bed; he throws1Speculum Perfectionis, ed. P.

Every one knows cases of this incompleteand ineffective desire for reform,—drunkards whom, with all their self-reproaches and resolves, one perceives to bequite unwilling seriously to contemplate never being drunk again! Really to give up anything on which we have relied,to give it up definitively, 'for good and all' and forever, signifies one of those radical alterations of character whichcame under our notice in the lectures on conversion. In it the inner man rolls over into an entirely different position ofequilibrium, lives in a new centre of energy from this time on, and the turning-point and hinge of all such operationsseems usually to involve the sincere acceptance of certain nakednesses and destitutions.Accordingly, throughout the annals of the saintly life, we find this ever-recurring note: Fling yourself upon God'sprovidence without making any reserve whatever,—take no thought for the morrow,—sell all you have and give it tothe poor,—only when the sacrifice is ruthless and reckless will the higher safety really arrive. As a concrete examplelet me read a page from the biography of Antoinette Bourignon, a good woman, much persecuted in her day by bothProtestants and Catholics, because she would not take her religion at second hand. When a young girl, in her father'shouse,—\"She spent whole nights in prayer, oft repeating: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And being one night in a most profound penitence,she said from the bottom of her heart: 'O my Lord! What must I do to please thee? For I have nobody to teach me. Speak to my soul andit will hear thee.' At that instant she heard, as if another had spoke within her: Forsake all earthly things. Separate thyself from the loveof the creatures. Deny thyself. She was quite astonished, not understanding this language, and mused long on these three points, thinkinghow she could fulfill them. She thought she could not live without earthly things, nor without loving the creatures, nor without lovingherself. Yet she said, 'By thy Grace I will do it, Lord!' But when she would perform her promise, she knew not where to begin. Havingthought on the religious in monasteries, that"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP295 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 39]Page 295they forsook all earthly things by being shut up in a cloister, and the love of themselves by subjecting of their wills, she asked leave of herfather to enter into a cloister of the barefoot Carmelites, but he would not permit it, saying he would rather see her laid in her grave. Thisseemed to her a great cruelty, for she thought to find in the cloister the true Christians she had been seeking, but she found afterwardsthat he knew the cloisters better than she; for after he had forbidden her, and told her he would never permit her to be a religious, norgive her any money to enter there, yet she went to Father Laurens, the Director, and offered to serve in the monastery and work hard forher bread, and be content with little, if he would receive her. At which he smiled and said: That cannot be. We must have money to build;we take no maids without money; you must find the way to get it, else there is no entry here.\"This astonished her greatly, and she was thereby undeceived as to the cloisters, resolving to forsake all company and live alone till itshould please God to show her what she ought to do and whither to go. She asked always earnestly, 'When shall I be perfectly thine, Omy God?' And she thought he still answered her, When thou shalt no longer possess anything, and shalt die to thyself. 'And where shall Ido that, Lord?' He answered her, In the desert. This made so strong an impression on her soul that she aspired after this; but being a maidof eighteen years only, she was afraid of unlucky chances, and was never used to travel, and knew no way. She laid aside all these doubtsand said, 'Lord, thou wilt guide me how and where it shall please thee. It is for thee that I do it. I will lay aside my habit of a maid, andwill take that of a hermit that I may pass unknown.' Having then secretly made ready this habit, while her parents thought to havemarried her, her father having promised her to a rich French merchant, she prevented the time, and on Easter evening, having cut herhair, put on the habit, and slept a little, she went out of her chamber about four in the morning, taking nothing but one penny to buy breadfor that day. And it being said to her in the going out, Where is thy faith? in a penny? she threw it away, begging pardon of God for herfault, and saying, 'No, Lord,"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP296 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 41]Page 296my faith is not in a penny, but in thee alone.' Thus she went away wholly delivered from the heavy burthen of the cares and good thingsof this world, and found her soul so satisfied that she no longer wished for anything upon earth, resting entirely upon God, with this onlyfear lest she should be discovered and be obliged to return home; for she felt already more content in this poverty than she had done forall her life in all the delights of the world.\"1The penny was a small financial safeguard, but an effective spiritual obstacle. Not till it was thrown away could thecharacter settle into the new equilibrium completely.Over and above the mystery of self-surrender, there are in the cult of poverty other religious mysteries. There is themystery of veracity: \"Naked came I into the world,\" etc.,—whoever first said that, possessed this mystery. My ownbare entity must fight the battle—shams cannot save me. There is also the mystery of democracy, or sentiment of theequality before God of all his creatures. This sentiment (which seems in general to have been more widespread inMohammedan than in Christian lands) tends to nullify man's usual acquisi-1An Apology for M. Antonia Bourignon, London, 1699, pp. 269, 270, abridged.Another example from Starbuck's MS. collection:—\"At a meeting held at six the next morning, I heard a man relate his experience. He said: The Lord asked him if he would confess Christamong the quarrymen with whom he worked, and he said he would. Then he asked him if he would give up to be used of the Lord the fourhundred dollars he had laid up, and he said he would, and thus the Lord saved him. The thought came to me at once that I had never made areal consecration either of myself or of my property to the Lord, but had always tried to serve the Lord in my way. Now the Lord asked me ifI would serve him in his way, and go out alone and penniless if he so ordered. The question was pressed home, and I must decide: To forsakeall and have him, or have all and lose him! I soon decided to take him; and the blessed assurance came, that he had taken me for his own, andmy joy was full. I returned home from the meeting with feelings as simple as a child. I thought all would be glad to hear of the joy of theLord that possessed me, and so I began to tell the simple story. But to my great surprise, the pastors (for I attended meetings in threechurches) opposed the experience and said it was fanaticism, and one told the members of his church to shun those that professed it, and Isoon found that my foes were those of my own household.\""},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP297 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 42]Page 297tiveness. Those who have it spurn dignities and honors, privileges and advantages, preferring, as I said in a formerlecture, to grovel on the common level before the face of God. It is not exactly the sentiment of humility, though itcomes so close to it in practice. It is humanity, rather, refusing to enjoy anything that others do not share. A profoundmoralist, writing of Christ's saying, 'Sell all thou hast and follow me,' proceeds as follows:—\"Christ may have meant: If you love mankind absolutely you will as a result not care for any possessions whatever, and this seems a verylikely proposition. But it is one thing to believe that a proposition is probably true; it is another thing to see it as a fact. If you lovedmankind as Christ loved them, you would see his conclusion as a fact. It would be obvious. You would sell your goods, and they wouldbe no loss to you. These truths, while literal to Christ, and to any mind that has Christ's love for mankind, become parables to lessernatures. There are in every generation people who, beginning innocently, with no predetermined intention of becoming saints, findthemselves drawn into the vortex by their interest in helping mankind, and by the understanding that comes from actually doing it. Theabandonment of their old mode of life is like dust in the balance. It is done gradually, incidentally, imperceptibly. Thus the wholequestion of the abandonment of luxury is no question at all, but a mere incident to another question, namely, the degree to which weabandon ourselves to the remorseless logic of our love for others.\"1But in all these matters of sentiment one must have 'been there' one's self in order to understand them. No Americancan ever attain to understanding the loyalty of a Briton towards his king, of a German towards his emperor; nor can aBriton or German ever understand the peace of heart of an American in having no king, no Kaiser, no spuriousnonsense, between him and the common God of all. If sentiments as simple as these are mysteries which one mustreceive as gifts of birth, how much more is this the case with those1J. J.

One can never fathom an emotion or divine its dictatesby standing outside of it. In the glowing hour of excitement, however, all incomprehensibilities are solved, and whatwas so enigmatical from without becomes transparently obvious. Each emotion obeys a logic of its own, and makesdeductions which no other logic can draw. Piety and charity live in a different universe from worldly lusts and fears,and form another centre of energy altogether. As in a supreme sorrow lesser vexations may become a consolation; asa supreme love may turn minor sacrifices into gain; so a supreme trust may render common safeguards odious, and incertain glows of generous excitement it may appear unspeakably mean to retain one's hold of personal possessions.The only sound plan, if we are ourselves outside the pale of such emotions, is to observe as well as we are able thosewho feel them, and to record faithfully what we observe; and this, I need hardly say, is what I have striven to do inthese last two descriptive lectures, which I now hope will have covered the ground sufficiently for our present needs."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP299 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 45]Page 299Lectures XIV and XVThe Value of SaintlinessWe have now passed in review the more important of the phenomena which are regarded as fruits of genuine religionand characteristics of men who are devout. To-day we have to change our attitude from that of description to that ofappreciation; we have to ask whether the fruits in question can help us to judge the absolute value of what religionadds to human life. Were I to parody Kant, I should say that a 'Critique of pure Saintliness' must be our theme.If, in turning to this theme, we could descend upon our subject from above like Catholic theologians, with our fixeddefinitions of man and man's perfection and our positive dogmas about God, we should have an easy time of it. Man'sperfection would be the fulfillment of his end; and his end would be union with his Maker. That union could bepursued by him along three paths, active, purgative, and contemplative, respectively; and progress along either pathwould be a simple matter to measure by the application of a limited number of theological and moral conceptions anddefinitions. The absolute significance and value of any bit of religious experience we might hear of would thus begiven almost mathematically into our hands.If convenience were everything, we ought now to grieve at finding ourselves cut off from so admirably convenient amethod as this. But we did cut ourselves off from it deliberately in those remarks which you remember we made, inour first lecture, about the empirical method; and it must be confessed that after that act of renunciation we can neverhope for clean-cut and scholastic results. We cannot divide man sharply into an animal and a rational part. We cannotdistinguish natural from supernatural effects; nor among the latter know which are favors of God, and which arecounterfeit operations of the demon. We have merely to collect things together without any special a prioritheological system, and out of an aggregate of piecemeal judgments as to the value of this and that experience—judgments in which our general philo-"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP300 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 46]Page 300sophic prejudices, our instincts, and our common sense are our only guides—decide that on the whole one type ofreligion is approved by its fruits, and another type condemned. 'On the whole,'—I fear we shall never escapecomplicity with that qualification, so dear to your practical man, so repugnant to your systematizer!I also fear that as I make this frank confession, I may seem to some of you to throw our compass overboard, and toadopt caprice as our pilot. Skepticism or wayward choice, you may think, can be the only results of such a formlessmethod as I have taken up. A few remarks in deprecation of such an opinion, and in farther explanation of theempiricist principles which I profess, may therefore appear at this point to be in place.Abstractly, it would seem illogical to try to measure the worth of a religion's fruits in merely human terms of value.How can you measure their worth without considering whether the God really exists who is supposed to inspire them?If he really exists, then all the conduct instituted by men to meet his wants must necessarily be a reasonable fruit ofhis religion,—it would be unreasonable only in case he did not exist. If, for instance, you were to condemn a religionof human or animal sacrifices by virtue of your subjective sentiments, and if all the while a deity were really theredemanding such sacrifices, you would be making a theoretical mistake by tacitly assuming that the deity must be non-existent; you would be setting up a theology of your own as much as if you were a scholastic philosopher.To this extent, to the extent of disbelieving peremptorily in certain types of deity, I frankly confess that we must betheologians. If disbeliefs can be said to constitute a theology, then the prejudices, instincts, and common sense which Ichose as our guides make theological partisans of us whenever they make certain beliefs abhorrent.But such common-sense prejudices and instincts are themselves the fruit of an empirical evolution. Nothing is morestriking than the secular alteration that goes on in the moral and religious tone of men, as their insight into nature andtheir social arrangements progressively develop. After an"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP301 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 48]Page 301interval of a few generations the mental climate proves unfavorable to notions of the deity which at an earlier datewere perfectly satisfactory: the older gods have fallen below the common secular level, and can no longer be believedin. Today a deity who should require bleeding sacrifices to placate him would be too sanguinary to be taken seriously.Even if powerful historical credentials were put forward in his favor, we would not look at them. Once, on thecontrary, his cruel appetites were of themselves credentials. They positively recommended him to men's imaginationsin ages when such coarse signs of power were respected and no others could be understood. Such deities then wereworshiped because such fruits were relished.Doubtless historic accidents always played some later part, but the original factor in fixing the figure of the gods mustalways have been psychological. The deity to whom the prophets, seers, and devotees who founded the particular cultbore witness was worth something to them personally. They could use him. He guided their imagination, warrantedtheir hopes, and controlled their will,—or else they required him as a safeguard against the demon and a curber ofother people's crimes. In any case, they chose him for the value of the fruits he seemed to them to yield. So soon asthe fruits began to seem quite worthless; so soon as they conflicted with indispensable human ideals, or thwarted tooextensively other values; so soon as they appeared childish, contemptible, or immoral when reflected on, the deitygrew discredited, and was erelong neglected and forgotten. It was in this way that the Greek and Roman gods ceasedto be believed in by educated pagans; it is thus that we ourselves judge of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Mohammedantheologies; Protestants have so dealt with the Catholic notions of deity, and liberal Protestants with older Protestantnotions; it is thus that Chinamen judge of us, and that all of us now living will be judged by our descendants. Whenwe cease to admire or approve what the definition of a deity implies, we end by deeming that deity incredible.Few historic changes are more curious than these mutations of theological opinion. The monarchical type ofsovereignty was, for example, so ineradicably planted in the mind"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP302 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 55]Page 302of our own forefathers that a dose of cruelty and arbitrariness in their deity seems positively to have been required bytheir imagination. They called the cruelty 'retributive justice,' and a God without it would certainly have struck themas not 'sovereign' enough. But to-day we abhor the very notion of eternal suffering inflicted; and that arbitrarydealing-out of salvation and damnation to selected individuals, of which Jonathan Edwards could persuade himselfthat he had not only a conviction, but a 'delightful conviction,' as of a doctrine 'exceeding pleasant, bright, and sweet,'appears to us, if sovereignly anything, sovereignly irrational and mean. Not only the cruelty, but the paltriness ofcharacter of the gods believed in by earlier centuries also strikes later centuries with surprise. We shall see examplesof it from the annals of Catholic saintship which make us rub our Protestant eyes. Ritual worship in general appears tothe modern transcendentalist, as well as to the ultra-puritanic type of mind, as if addressed to a deity of an almostabsurdly childish character, taking delight in toyshop furniture, tapers and tinsel, costume and mumbling andmummery, and finding his 'glory' incomprehensibly enhanced thereby;—just as on the other hand the formlessspaciousness of pantheism appears quite empty to ritualistic natures, and the gaunt theism of evangelical sects seemsintolerably bald and chalky and bleak. Luther, says Emerson, would have cut off his right hand rather than nail histheses to the door at Wittenberg, if he had supposed that they were destined to lead to the pale negations of BostonUnitarianism.So far, then, although we are compelled, whatever may be our pretensions to empiricism, to employ some sort of astandard of theological probability of our own whenever we assume to estimate the fruits of other men's religion, yetthis very standard has been begotten out of the drift of common life. It is the voice of human experience within us,judging and condemning all gods that stand athwart the pathway along which it feels itself to be advancing.Experience, if we take it in the largest sense, is thus the parent of those disbeliefs which, it was charged, wereinconsistent with the experiential method. The inconsistency, you see, is immaterial, and the charge may be neglected.If we pass from disbeliefs to positive beliefs, it seems to me"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP303 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 56]Page 303that there is not even a formal inconsistency to be laid against our method. The gods we stand by are the gods we needand can use, the gods whose demands on us are reinforcements of our demands on ourselves and on one another.What I then propose to do is, briefly stated, to test saintliness by common sense, to use human standards to help usdecide how far the religious life commends itself as an ideal kind of human activity. If it commends itself, then anytheological beliefs that may inspire it, in so far forth will stand accredited. If not, then they will be discredited, and allwithout reference to anything but human working principles. It is but the elimination of the humanly unfit, and thesurvival of the humanly fittest, applied to religious beliefs; and if we look at history candidly and without prejudice,we have to admit that no religion has ever in the long run established or proved itself in any other way. Religions haveapproved themselves; they have ministered to sundry vital needs which they found reigning. When they violated otherneeds too strongly, or when other faiths came which served the same needs better, the first religions were supplanted.The needs were always many, and the tests were never sharp. So the reproach of vagueness and subjectivity and 'onthe whole'-ness, which can with perfect legitimacy be addressed to the empirical method as we are forced to use it, isafter all a reproach to which the entire life of man in dealing with these matters is obnoxious. No religion has ever yetowed its prevalence to 'apodictic certainty.' In a later lecture I will ask whether objective certainty can ever be addedby theological reasoning to a religion that already empirically prevails.One word, also, about the reproach that in following this sort of an empirical method we are handing ourselves over tosystematic skepticism.Since it is impossible to deny secular alterations in our sentiments and needs, it would be absurd to affirm that one'sown age of the world can be beyond correction by the next age. Skepticism cannot, therefore, be ruled out by any setof thinkers as a possibility against which their conclusions are secure; and no empiricist ought to claim exemptionfrom this"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP304 hl[01 03 2011 00 29 57]Page 304universal liability. But to admit one's liability to correction is one thing, and to embark upon a sea of wanton doubt isanother. Of willfully playing into the hands of skepticism we cannot be accused. He who acknowledges theimperfectness of his instrument, and makes allowance for it in discussing his observations, is in a much better positionfor gaining truth than if he claimed his instrument to be infallible. Or is dogmatic or scholastic theology less doubtedin point of fact for claiming, as it does, to be in point of right undoubtable? And if not, what command over truthwould this kind of theology really lose if, instead of absolute certainty, she only claimed reasonable probability for herconclusions? If we claim only reasonable probability, it will be as much as men who love the truth can ever at anygiven moment hope to have within their grasp. Pretty surely it will be more than we could have had, if we wereunconscious of our liability to err.Nevertheless, dogmatism will doubtless continue to condemn us for this confession. The mere outward form ofinalterable certainty is so precious to some minds that to renounce it explicitly is for them out of the question. Theywill claim it even where the facts most patently pronounce its folly. But the safe thing is surely to recognize that allthe insights of creatures of a day like ourselves must be provisional. The wisest of critics is an altering being, subjectto the better insight of the morrow, and right at any moment, only 'up to date' and 'on the whole.' When larger rangesof truth open, it is surely best to be able to open ourselves to their reception, unfettered by our previous pretensions.''Heartily know, when half-gods go, the gods arrive.\"The fact of diverse judgments about religious phenomena is therefore entirely unescapable, whatever may be one'sown desire to attain the irreversible. But apart from that fact, a more fundamental question awaits us, the questionwhether men's opinions ought to be expected to be absolutely uniform in this field. Ought all men to have the samereligion? Ought they to approve the same fruits and follow the same leadings? Are they so like in their inner needsthat, for hard and soft, for proud and humble, for strenuous and lazy, for healthy-minded and despairing, exactly thesame religious incentives are required? Or are different functions in the organism of"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP305 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 09]Page 305humanity allotted to different types of man, so that some may really be the better for a religion of consolation andreassurance, whilst others are better for one of terror and reproof? It might conceivably be so; and we shall, I think,more and more suspect it to be so as we go on. And if it be so, how can any possible judge or critic help being biasedin favor of the religion by which his own needs are best met? He aspires to impartiality; but he is too close to thestruggle not to be to some degree a participant, and he is sure to approve most warmly those fruits of piety in otherswhich taste most good and prove most nourishing to him.I am well aware of how anarchic much of what I say may sound. Expressing myself thus abstractly and briefly, I mayseem to despair of the very notion of truth. But I beseech you to reserve your judgment until we see it applied to thedetails which lie before us. I do indeed disbelieve that we or any other mortal men can attain on a given day toabsolutely incorrigible and unimprovable truth about such matters of fact as those with which religions deal. But Ireject this dogmatic ideal not out of a perverse delight in intellectual instability. I am no lover of disorder and doubtas such. Rather do I fear to lose truth by this pretension to possess it already wholly. That we can gain more and moreof it by moving always in the right direction, I believe as much as any one, and I hope to bring you all to my way ofthinking before the termination of these lectures. Till then, do not, I pray you, harden your minds irrevocably againstthe empiricism which I profess.I will waste no more words, then, in abstract justification of my method, but seek immediately to use it upon the facts.In critically judging of the value of religious phenomena, it is very important to insist on the distinction betweenreligion as an individual personal function, and religion as an institutional, corporate, or tribal product. I drew thisdistinction, you may remember, in my second lecture. The word 'religion,' as ordinarily used, is equivocal. A survey ofhistory shows us that, as a rule, religious geniuses attract disciples, and produce groups of sympathizers. When thesegroups get strong enough to 'organize' themselves, they become ecclesiastical institutions with corporate ambitions oftheir own."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP306 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 11]Page 306The spirit of politics and the lust of dogmatic rule are then apt to enter and to contaminate the originally innocentthing; so that when we hear the word 'religion' nowadays, we think inevitably of some 'church' or other; and to somepersons the word 'church' suggests so much hypocrisy and tyranny and meanness and tenacity of superstition that in awholesale undiscerning way they glory in saying that they are 'down' on religion altogether. Even we who belong tochurches do not exempt other churches than our own from the general condemnation.But in this course of lectures ecclesiastical institutions hardly concern us at all. The religious experience which we arestudying is that which lives itself out within the private breast. First-hand individual experience of this kind hasalways appeared as a heretical sort of innovation to those who witnessed its birth. Naked comes it into the world andlonely; and it has always, for a time at least, driven him who had it into the wilderness, often into the literal wildernessout of doors, where the Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, St. Francis, George Fox, and so many others had to go. GeorgeFox expresses well this isolation; and I can do no better at this point than read to you a page from his Journal,referring to the period of his youth when religion began to ferment within him seriously.\"I fasted much,\" Fox says, \"walked abroad in solitary places many days, and often took my Bible, and sat in hollow trees and lonesomeplaces until night came on; and frequently in the night walked mournfully about by myself; for I was a man of sorrows in the time of thefirst workings of the Lord in me.\"During all this time I was never joined in profession of religion with any, but gave up myself to the Lord, having forsaken all evilcompany, taking leave of father and mother, and all other relations, and traveled up and down as a stranger on the earth, which way theLord inclined my heart; taking a chamber to myself in the town where I came, and tarrying sometimes more, sometimes less in a place:for I durst not stay long in a place, being afraid both of professor and profane, lest, being a tender young man, I"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP307 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 12]Page 307should be hurt by conversing much with either. For which reason I kept much as a stranger, seeking heavenly wisdom and gettingknowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from outward things, to rely on the Lord alone. As I had forsaken the priests, so I left theseparate preachers also, and those called the most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them all that could speak to mycondition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what todo; then, oh then, I heard a voice which said, 'There is one, even Jesus Christ, that can speak to thy condition.' When I heard it, my heartdid leap for joy. Then the Lord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition. I had not fellowship withany people, priests, nor professors, nor any sort of separated people. I was afraid of all carnal talk and talkers, for I could see nothing butcorruptions. When I was in the deep, under all shut up, I could not believe that I should ever overcome; my troubles, my sorrows, and mytemptations were so great that I often thought I should have despaired, I was so tempted. But when Christ opened to me how he wastempted by the same devil, and had overcome him, and had bruised his head; and that through him and his power, life, grace, and spirit, Ishould overcome also, I had confidence in him. If I had had a king's diet, palace, and attendance, all would have been as nothing; fornothing gave me comfort but the Lord by his power. I saw professors, priests, and people were whole and at ease in that condition whichwas my misery, and they loved that which I would have been rid of. But the Lord did stay my desires upon himself, and my care was castupon him alone.\"1A genuine first-hand religious experience like this is bound to be a heterodoxy to its witnesses, the prophet appearingas a mere lonely madman. If his doctrine prove contagious enough to spread to any others, it becomes a definite andlabeled heresy. But if it then still prove contagious enough to triumph over persecution, it becomes itself anorthodoxy; and1GEORGE FOX: Journal, Philadelphia, 1800, pp. 59 61, abridged."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP308 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 13]Page 308when a religion has become an orthodoxy, its day of inwardness is over: the spring is dry; the faithful live at secondhand exclusively and stone the prophets in their turn. The new church, in spite of whatever human goodness it mayfoster, can be henceforth counted on as a staunch ally in every attempt to stifle the spontaneous religious spirit, and tostop all later bubblings of the fountain from which in purer days it drew its own supply of inspiration. Unless, indeed,by adopting new movements of the spirit it can make capital out of them and use them for its selfish corporatedesigns! Of protective action of this politic sort, promptly or tardily decided on, the dealings of the Romanecclesiasticism with many individual saints and prophets yield examples enough for our instruction.The plain fact is that men's minds are built, as has been often said, in water-tight compartments. Religious after afashion, they yet have many other things in them beside their religion, and unholy entanglements and associationsinevitably obtain. The basenesses so commonly charged to religion's account are thus, almost all of them, notchargeable at all to religion proper, but rather to religion's wicked practical partner, the spirit of corporate dominion.And the bigotries are most of them in their turn chargeable to religion's wicked intellectual partner, the spirit ofdogmatic dominion, the passion for laying down the law in the form of an absolutely closed-in theoretic system. Theecclesiastical spirit in general is the sum of these two spirits of dominion; and I beseech you never to confound thephenomena of mere tribal or corporate psychology which it presents with those manifestations of the purely interiorlife which are the exclusive object of our study. The baiting of Jews, the hunting of Albigenses and Waldenses, thestoning of Quakers and ducking of Methodists, the murdering of Mormons and the massacring of Armenians, expressmuch rather that aboriginal human neophobia, that pugnacity of which we all share the vestiges, and that inborn hatredof the alien and of eccentric and non-conforming men as aliens, than they express the positive piety of the variousperpetrators. Piety is the mask, the inner force is tribal instinct. You believe as little as I do, in spite of the Christianunction with which the German emperor addressed"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP309 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 15]Page 309his troops upon their way to China, that the conduct which he suggested, and in which other Christian armies wentbeyond them, had anything whatever to do with the interior religious life of those concerned in the performance.Well, no more for past atrocities than for this atrocity should we make piety responsible. At most we may blame pietyfor not availing to check our natural passions, and sometimes for supplying them with hypocritical pretexts. Buthypocrisy also imposes obligations, and with the pretext usually couples some restriction; and when the passion gustis over, the piety may bring a reaction of repentance which the irreligious natural man would not have shown.For many of the historic aberrations which have been laid to her charge, religion as such, then, is not to blame. Yet ofthe charge that over-zealousness or fanaticism is one of her liabilities we cannot wholly acquit her, so I will nextmake a remark upon that point. But I will preface it by a preliminary remark which connects itself with much thatfollows.Our survey of the phenomena of saintliness has unquestionably produced in your minds an impression ofextravagance. Is it necessary, some of you have asked, as one example after another came before us, to be quite sofantastically good as that? We who have no vocation for the extremer ranges of sanctity will surely be let off at thelast day if our humility, asceticism, and devoutness prove of a less convulsive sort. This practically amounts to sayingthat much that it is legitimate to admire in this field need nevertheless not be imitated, and that religious phenomena,like all other human phenomena, are subject to the law of the golden mean. Political reformers accomplish theirsuccessive tasks in the history of nations by being blind for the time to other causes. Great schools of art work out theeffects which it is their mission to reveal, at the cost of a one-sidedness for which other schools must make amends.We accept a John Howard, a Mazzini, a Botticelli, a Michael Angelo, with a kind of indulgence. We are glad theyexisted to show us that way, but we are glad there are also other ways of seeing and taking life. So of many of thesaints whom we have looked at. We are proud of a human nature that could be so passionately extreme, but we"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP310 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 16]Page 310shrink from advising others to follow the example. The conduct we blame ourselves for not following lies nearer tothe middle line of human effort. It is less dependent on particular beliefs and doctrines. It is such as wears well indifferent ages, such as under different skies all judges are able to commend.The fruits of religion, in other words, are, like all human products, liable to corruption by excess. Common sense mustjudge them. It need not blame the votary; but it may be able to praise him only conditionally, as one who actsfaithfully according to his lights. He shows us heroism in one way, but the unconditionally good way is that for whichno indulgence need be asked.We find that error by excess is exemplified by every saintly virtue. Excess, in human faculties, means usually one-sidedness or want of balance; for it is hard to imagine an essential faculty too strong, if only other faculties equallystrong be there to coöperate with it in action. Strong affections need a strong will; strong active powers need a strongintellect; strong intellect needs strong sympathies, to keep life steady. If the balance exist, no one faculty can possiblybe too strong—we only get the stronger all-round character. In the life of saints, technically so called, the spiritualfaculties are strong, but what gives the impression of extravagance proves usually on examination to be a relativedeficiency of intellect. Spiritual excitement takes pathological forms whenever other interests are too few and theintellect too narrow. We find this exemplified by all the saintly attributes in turn—devout love of God, purity, charity,asceticism, all may lead astray. I will run over these virtues in succession.First of all let us take Devoutness. When unbalanced, one of its vices is called Fanaticism. Fanaticism (when not amere expression of ecclesiastical ambition) is only loyalty carried to a convulsive extreme. When an intensely loyaland narrow mind is once grasped by the feeling that a certain superhuman person is worthy of its exclusive devotion,one of the first things that happens is that it idealizes the devotion itself. To adequately realize the merits of the idolgets to be considered the one great merit of the worshiper; and the sacrifices and servilities by which savagetribesmen have from time imme-"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP311 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 18]Page 311morial exhibited their faithfulness to chieftains are now outbid in favor of the deity. Vocabularies are exhausted andlanguages altered in the attempt to praise him enough; death is looked on as gain if it attract his grateful notice; andthe personal attitude of being his devotee becomes what one might almost call a new and exalted kind of professionalspecialty within the tribe.1 The legends that gather round the lives of holy persons are fruits of this impulse tocelebrate and glorify. The Buddha2 and Mohammed3 and their companions and many Christian saints are incrustedwith a heavy jewelry of anecdotes which are meant to be honorific, but are simply abgeschmackt and silly, and forma touching expression of man's misguided propensity to praise.An immediate consequence of this condition of mind is jealousy for the deity's honor. How can the devotee show hisloyalty better than by sensitiveness in this regard? The slightest affront or neglect must be resented, the deity'senemies must be put to shame. In exceedingly narrow minds and active wills, such a care may become an engrossingpre-1Christian saints have had their specialties of devotion, Saint Francis to Christ's wounds; Saint Anthony of Padua to Christ's childhood;Saint Bernard to his humanity; Saint Teresa to Saint Joseph, etc. The Shi-ite Mohammedans venerate Ali, the Prophet's son-in-law,instead of Abu-bekr, his brother-in-law. Vambéry describes a dervish whom he met in Persia, \"who had solemnly vowed, thirty yearsbefore, that he would never employ his organs of speech otherwise but in uttering, everlastingly, the name of his favorite, Ali, Ali. Hethus wished to signify to the world that he was the most devoted partisan of that Ali who had been dead a thousand years. In his ownhome, speaking with his wife, children, and friends, no other word but 'Ali!' ever passed his lips. If he wanted food or drink or anythingelse, he expressed his wants still by repeating 'Ali!' Begging or buying at the bazaar, it was always 'Ali!' Treated ill or generously, hewould still harp on his monotonous 'Ali!' Latterly his zeal assumed such tremendous proportions that, like a madman, he would race, thewhole day, up and down the streets of the town, throwing his stick high up into the air, and shriek out, all the while, at the top of hisvoice, 'Ali!' This dervish was venerated by everybody as a saint, and received everywhere with the greatest distinction.\" ARMINIUSVAMBÉRY, his Life and Adventures, written by Himself, London, 1889, p. 69. On the anniversary of the death of Hussein, Ali's son, theShi-ite Moslems still make the air resound with cries of his name and Ali's.2Compare H. C. WARREN: Buddhism in Translation, Cambridge, U. S., 1898, passim.3Compare J. L.

Theologies representing the gods as mindful of their glory, and churches with imperialisticpolicies, have conspired to fan this temper to a glow, so that intolerance and persecution have come to be vicesassociated by some of us inseparably with the saintly mind. They are unquestionably its besetting sins. The saintlytemper is a moral temper, and a moral temper has often to be cruel. It is a partisan temper, and that is cruel. Betweenhis own and Jehovah's enemies a David knows no difference; a Catherine of Siena, panting to stop the warfare amongChristians which was the scandal of her epoch, can think of no better method of union among them than a crusade tomassacre the Turks; Luther finds no word of protest or regret over the atrocious tortures with which the Anabaptistleaders were put to death; and a Cromwell praises the Lord for delivering his enemies into his hands for 'execution.'Politics come in in all such cases; but piety finds the partnership not quite unnatural. So, when 'freethinkers' tell us thatreligion and fanaticism are twins, we cannot make an unqualified denial of the charge.Fanaticism must then be inscribed on the wrong side of religion's account, so long as the religious person's intellect ison the stage which the despotic kind of God satisfies. But as soon as the God is represented as less intent on his ownhonor and glory, it ceases to be a danger.Fanaticism is found only where the character is masterful and aggressive. In gentle characters, where devoutness isintense and the intellect feeble, we have an imaginative absorption in the love of God to the exclusion of all practicalhuman interests, which, though innocent enough, is too one-sided to be admirable. A mind too narrow has room butfor one kind of affection. When the love of God takes possession of such a mind, it expels all human loves and humanuses. There is no English name for such a sweet excess of devotion, so I will refer to it as a theopathic condition.The blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque may serve as an example.\"To be loved here upon the earth,\" her recent biographer"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP313 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 20]Page 313exclaims: \"to be loved by a noble, elevated, distinguished being; to be loved with fidelity, with devotion,—what enchantment! But to beloved by God! and loved by him to distraction [aimé jusqu'à la folie]!—Margaret melted away with love at the thought of such a thing.Like Saint Philip of Neri in former times, or like Saint Francis Xavier, she said to God: 'Hold back, O my God, these torrents whichoverwhelm me, or else enlarge my capacity for their reception.'\"1The most signal proofs of God's love which Margaret Mary received were her hallucinations of sight, touch, and hearing, and the mostsignal in turn of these were the revelations of Christ's sacred heart, \"surrounded with rays more brilliant than the Sun, and transparentlike a crystal. The wound which he received on the cross visibly appeared upon it. There was a crown of thorns round about this divineHeart, and a cross above it.\" At the same time Christ's voice told her that, unable longer to contain the flames of his love for mankind, hehad chosen her by a miracle to spread the knowledge of them. He thereupon took out her mortal heart, placed it inside of his own andinflamed it, and then replaced it in her breast, adding: \"Hitherto thou hast taken the name of my slave, hereafter thou shalt be called thewell-beloved disciple of my Sacred Heart.\"In a later vision the Saviour revealed to her in detail the 'great design' which he wished to establish through her instrumentality. \"I ask ofthee to bring it about that every first Friday after the week of holy Sacrament shall be made into a special holy day for honoring my Heartby a general communion and by services intended to make honorable amends for the indignities which it has received. And I promisethee that my Heart will dilate to shed with abundance the influences of its love upon all those who pay to it these honors, or who bring itabout that others do the same.\"\"This revelation,\" says Mgr. Bougaud, \"is unquestionably the most important of all the revelations which have illu-1BOUGAUD: Hist. de la bienheureuse Marguerite Marie, Paris, 1894, p. 145."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP314 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 22]Page 314mined the Church since that of the Incarnation and of the Lord's Supper. After the Eucharist, the supreme effort ofthe Sacred Heart.''1 Well, what were its good fruits for Margaret Mary's life? Apparently little else but sufferings andprayers and absences of mind and swoons and ecstasies. She became increasingly useless about the convent, herabsorption in Christ's love,—\"which grew upon her daily, rendering her more and more incapable of attending to external duties. They tried her in the infirmary, butwithout much success, although her kindness, zeal, and devotion were without bounds, and her charity rose to acts of such a heroism thatour readers would not bear the recital of them. They tried her in the kitchen, but were forced to give it up as hopeless—everythingdropped out of her hands. The admirable humility with which she made amends for her clumsiness could not prevent this from beingprejudicial to the order and regularity which must always reign in a community. They put her in the school, where the little girlscherished her, and cut pieces out of her clothes [for relics] as if she were already a saint, but where she was too absorbed inwardly to paythe necessary attention. Poor dear sister, even less after her visions than before them was she a denizen of earth, and they had to leave herin her heaven.\"2Poor dear sister, indeed! Amiable and good, but so feeble of intellectual outlook that it would be too much to ask ofus, with our Protestant and modern education, to feel anything but indulgent pity for the kind of saintship which sheembodies. A lower example still of theopathic saintliness is that of Saint Gertrude, a Benedictine nun of the thirteenthcentury, whose 'Revelations,' a well-known mystical authority, consist mainly of proofs of Christ's partiality for herundeserving person. Assurances of his love, intimacies and caresses and compliments of the most absurd and puerilesort, addressed by Christ to Gertrude as an individual, form the tissue of this1BOUGAUD: Hist. de la bienheureuse Marguerite Marie, Paris, 1894, pp. 365, 241.2BOUGAUD: Op. cit., p. 267."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP315 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 23]Page 315paltry-minded recital.1 In reading such a narrative, we realize the gap between the thirteenth and the twentieth century,and we feel that saintliness of character may yield almost absolutely worthless fruits if it be associated with suchinferior intellectual sympathies. What with science, idealism, and democracy, our own imagination has grown to needa God of an entirely different temperament from that Being interested exclusively in dealing out personal favors, withwhom our ancestors were so contented. Smitten as we are with the vision of social righteousness, a God indifferent toeverything but adulation, and full of partiality for his individual favorites, lacks an essential element of largeness; andeven the best professional sainthood of former centuries, pent in as it is to such a conception, seems to us curiouslyshallow and unedifying.Take Saint Teresa, for example, one of the ablest women, in many respects, of whose life we have the record. She hada powerful intellect of the practical order. She wrote admirable descriptive psychology, possessed a will equal to anyemergency, great talent for politics and business, a buoyant disposition, and a first-rate literary style. She wastenaciously aspiring, and put her whole life at the service of her religious1Examples: \"Suffering from a headache, she sought, for the glory of God, to relieve herself by holding certain odoriferous substances inher mouth, when the Lord appeared to her to lean over towards her lovingly, and to find comfort Himself in these odors. After havinggently breathed them in, He arose, and said with a gratified air to the Saints, as if contented with what He had done: 'See the new presentwhich my betrothed has given Me!'\"One day, at chapel, she heard supernaturally sung the words, 'Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus.' The Son of God leaning towards her like a sweetlover, and giving to her soul the softest kiss, said to her at the second Sanctus: 'In this Sanctus addressed to my person, receive with this kissall the sanctity of my divinity and of my humanity, and let it be to thee a sufficient preparation for approaching the communion table.' Andthe next following Sunday, while she was thanking God for this favor, behold the Son of God, more beauteous than thousands of angels,takes her in His arms as if He were proud of her, and presents her to God the Father, in that perfection of sanctity with which He haddowered her. And the Father took such delight in this soul thus presented by His only Son, that, as if unable longer to restrain Himself, Hegave her, and the Holy Ghost gave her also, the Sanctity attributed to each by His own Sanctus—and thus she remained endowed with theplenary fullness of the blessing of Sanctity, bestowed on her by Omnipotence, by Wisdom, and by Love.\" Révélations de Sainte Gertrude,Paris, 1898, i. 44, 186."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP316 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 31]Page 316ideals. Yet so paltry were these, according to our present way of thinking, that (although I know that others have beenmoved differently) I confess that my only feeling in reading her has been pity that so much vitality of soul shouldhave found such poor employment.In spite of the sufferings which she endured, there is a curious flavor of superficiality about her genius. ABirmingham anthropologist, Dr. Jordan, has divided the human race into two types, whom he calls 'shrews' and 'non-shrews' respectively.1 The shrew-type is defined as possessing an 'active unimpassioned temperament.' In other words,shrews are the 'motors,' rather than the 'sensories,'2 and their expressions are as a rule more energetic than the feelingswhich appear to prompt them. Saint Teresa, paradoxical as such a judgment may sound, was a typical shrew, in thissense of the term. The bustle of her style, as well as of her life, proves it. Not only must she receive unheard-ofpersonal favors and spiritual graces from her Saviour, but she must immediately write about them and exploiter themprofessionally, and use her expertness to give instruction to those less privileged. Her voluble egotism; her sense, notof radical bad being, as the really contrite have it, but of her 'faults' and 'imperfections' in the plural; her stereotypedhumility and return upon herself, as covered with 'confusion' at each new manifestation of God's singular partiality fora person so unworthy, are typical of shrewdom: a paramountly feeling nature would be objectively lost in gratitude,and silent. She had some public instincts, it is true; she hated the Lutherans, and longed for the church's triumph overthem; but in the main her idea of religion seems to have been that of an endless amatory flirtation—if one may say sowithout irreverence—between the devotee and the deity; and apart from helping younger nuns to go in this directionby the inspiration of her example and instruction, there is absolutely no human use in her, or sign of any generalhuman interest. Yet the spirit of her age, far from rebuking her, exalted her as superhuman.1FURNEAUX JORDAN: Character in Birth and Parentage, first edition. Later editions change the nomenclature.2As to this distinction, see the admirably practical account in J. M.

Any God who, on the one hand,can care to keep a pedantically minute account of individual shortcomings, and on the other can feel such partialities,and load particular creatures with such insipid marks of favor, is too small-minded a God for our credence. WhenLuther, in his immense manly way, swept off by a stroke of his hand the very notion of a debit and credit account keptwith individuals by the Almighty, he stretched the soul's imagination and saved theology from puerility.So much for mere devotion, divorced from the intellectual conceptions which might guide it towards bearing usefulhuman fruit.The next saintly virtue in which we find excess is Purity. In theopathic characters, like those whom we have justconsidered, the love of God must not be mixed with any other love. Father and mother, sisters, brothers, and friendsare felt as interfering distractions; for sensitiveness and narrowness, when they occur together, as they often do,require above all things a simplified world to dwell in. Variety and confusion are too much for their powers ofcomfortable adaptation. But whereas your aggressive pietist reaches his unity objectively, by forcibly stampingdisorder and divergence out, your retiring pietist reaches his subjectively, leaving disorder in the world at large, butmaking a smaller world in which he dwells himself and from which he eliminates it altogether. Thus, alongside of thechurch militant with its prisons, dragonnades, and inquisition methods, we have the church fugient, as one might callit, with its hermitages, monasteries, and sectarian organizations, both churches pursuing the same object—to unify thelife,1 and simplify the spectacle presented1On this subject I refer to the work of M. MURISIER (Les Maladies du Sentiment Religieux, Paris, 1901), who makes inner unification themainspring of the whole religious life. But all strongly ideal interests, religious or irreligious, unify the mind and tend to subordinateeverything to themselves. One would infer from M. Murisier's pages that this formal condition was peculiarly characteristic of religion,and that one might in comparison almost neglect material content, in studying the latter. I trust that the present work will convince thereader that religion has plenty of material content which is(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP318 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 46]Page 318to the soul. A mind extremely sensitive to inner discords will drop one external relation after another, as interferingwith the absorption of consciousness in spiritual things. Amusements must go first, then conventional 'society,' thenbusiness, then family duties, until at last seclusion, with a subdivision of the day into hours for stated religious acts, isthe only thing that can be borne. The lives of saints are a history of successive renunciations of complication, oneform of contact with the outer life being dropped after another, to save the purity of inner tone.1 \"Is it not better,\" ayoung sister asks her Superior, \"that I should not speak at all during the hour of recreation, so as not to run the risk, byspeaking, of falling into some sin of which I might not be conscious?\"2 If the life remains a social one at all, thosewho take part in it must follow one identical rule. Embosomed in this monotony, the zealot for purity feels clean andfree once more. The minuteness of uniformity maintained in certain sectarian communities, whether monastic or not,is something almost inconceivable to a man of the world. Costume, phraseology, hours, and habits are absolutelystereotyped, and there is no doubt that some persons are so made as to find in this stability an incomparable kind ofmental rest.We have no time to multiply examples, so I will let the case of Saint Louis of Gonzaga serve as a type of excess inpurifi-(Footnote continued from previous page)characteristic, and which is more important by far than any general psychological form. In spite of this criticism, I find M. Murisier'sbook highly instructive.1Example: \"At the first beginning of the Servitor's [Suso's] interior life, after he had purified his soul properly by confession, he marked outfor himself, in thought, three circles, within which he shut himself up, as in a spiritual intrenchment. The first circle was his cell, his chapel,and the choir. When he was within this circle, he seemed to himself in complete security. The second circle was the whole monastery as faras the outer gate. The third and outermost circle was the gate itself, and here it was necessary for him to stand well upon his guard. When hewent outside these circles, it seemed to him that he was in the plight of some wild animal which is outside its hole, and surrounded by thehunt, and therefore in need of all its cunning and watchfulness.\" The Life of the Blessed Henry Suso, by Himself, translated by KNOX,London, 1865, p. 168.2Vie des premières Religieuses Dominicaines de la Congrégation de St. Dominique, à Nancy; Nancy, 1896, p. 129."},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP319 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 47]Page 319cation. I think you will agree that this youth carried the elimination of the external and discordant to a point which wecannot unreservedly admire. At the age of ten, his biographer says:—\"The inspiration came to him to consecrate to the Mother of God his own virginity—that being to her the most agreeable of possiblepresents. Without delay, then, and with all the fervor there was in him, joyous of heart, and burning with love, he made his vow ofperpetual chastity. Mary accepted the offering of his innocent heart, and obtained for him from God, as a recompense, the extraordinarygrace of never feeling during his entire life the slightest tough of temptation against the virtue of purity. This was an altogetherexceptional favor, rarely accorded even to Saints themselves, and all the more marvelous in that Louis dwelt always in courts and amonggreat folks, where danger and opportunity are so unusually frequent. It is true that Louis from his earliest childhood had shown a naturalrepugnance for whatever might be impure or unvirginal, and even for relations of any sort whatever between persons of opposite sex. Butthis made it all the more surprising that he should, especially since this vow, feel it necessary to have recourse to such a number ofexpedients for protecting against even the shadow of danger the virginity which he had thus consecrated. One might suppose that if anyone could have contented himself with the ordinary precautions, prescribed for all Christians, it would assuredly have been he. But no! Inthe use of preservations and means of defense, in flight from the most insignificant occasions, from every possibility of peril, just as inthe mortification of his flesh, he went farther than the majority of saints. He, who by an extraordinary protection of God's grace wasnever tempted, measured all his steps as if he were threatened on every side by particular dangers. Thenceforward he never raised hiseyes, either when walking in the streets, or when in society.

He did not like to be alone with his own mother, whether at table or in conversation; and when therest of the company withdrew, he sought also a pretext for retiring. Several great ladies, relatives of his, he avoidedlearning to know even by sight; and he made a sort of treaty with his father, engaging promptly and readily to accedeto all his wishes, if he might only be excused from all visits to ladies.\" (Ibid., p. 71.)When he was seventeen years old Louis joined the Jesuit order,2 against his father's passionate entreaties, for he washeir of a princely house; and when a year later the father died, he took the loss as a 'particular attention' to himself onGod's part, and wrote letters of stilted good advice, as from a spiritual superior, to his grieving mother. He soonbecame so good a monk that if any one asked him the number of his brothers and sisters, he had to reflect and countthem over before replying. A Father asked him one day if he were never troubled by the thought of his family, towhich, \"I never think of them except when praying for them,\" was his only answer. Never was he seen to hold in hishand a flower or anything perfumed, that he might take pleasure in it. On the contrary, in the hospital, he used to seekfor whatever was most disgusting, and eagerly snatch the bandages of ulcers, etc., from the hands of his companions.He avoided worldly talk, and immediately tried to turn every conversation on to pious subjects, or else he remainedsilent. He systematically refused to notice his surroundings. Being ordered one day to bring a book from the rector'sseat in the refectory, he had1MESCHLER'S Life of Saint Louis of Gonzaga, French translation by LEBRÉQUIER, 1891, p. 40.2In his boyish note-book he praises the monastic life for its freedom from sin, and for the imperishable treasures, which it enables us to storeup, \"of merit in God's eyes which makes of Him our debtor for all Eternity.\" Loc. cit., p. 62."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP321 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 50]Page 321to ask where the rector sat, for in the three months he had eaten bread there, so carefully did he guard his eyes that hehad not noticed the place. One day, during recess, having looked by chance on one of his companions, he reproachedhimself as for a grave sin against modesty. He cultivated silence, as preserving from sins of the tongue; and hisgreatest penance was the limit which his superiors set to his bodily penances. He sought after false accusations andunjust reprimands as opportunities of humility; and such was his obedience that, when a room-mate, having no morepaper, asked him for a sheet, he did not feel free to give it to him without first obtaining the permission of thesuperior, who, as such, stood in the place of God, and transmitted his orders.I can find no other sorts of fruit than these of Louis's saintship. He died in 1591, in his twenty-ninth year, and isknown in the Church as the patron of all young people. On his festival, the altar in the chapel devoted to him in acertain church in Rome \"is embosomed in flowers, arranged with exquisite taste; and a pile of letters may be seen atits foot, written to the Saint by young men and women, and directed to 'Paradiso.'

It runs as follows:—\"The signs of abnormality which sanctified persons show are of frequent occurrence. They get out of tune with other people; often they willhave nothing to do with churches, which they regard as worldly; they become hypercritical towards others; they grow careless of their social,political, and financial obligations. As an instance of this type may be mentioned a woman of sixty-eight of whom the writer made a specialstudy. She had been a member of one of the most active and progressive churches in a busy part of a large city. Her pastor described her ashaving reached the censorious stage. She had grown more and more out of sympathy with the church; her connection with it finally consistedsimply in attendance at prayer-meeting, at which her only message was that of reproof and condemnation of the others for living on a lowplane. At last she withdrew from fellowship with any church. The writer found her living alone in a little room on the top story of a cheapboarding-house, quite out of touch with all human relations, but apparently happy in the enjoyment of her own spiritual blessings.

The Catholicism of the sixteenth century paid little heed to socialrighteousness; and to leave the world to the devil whilst saving one's own soul was then accounted no discreditablescheme. To-day, rightly or wrongly, helpfulness in general human affairs is, in consequence of one of those secularmutations in moral sentiment of which I spoke, deemed an essential element of worth in character; and to be of somepublic or private use is also reckoned as a species of divine service. Other early Jesuits, especially the missionariesamong them, the Xaviers, Brébeufs, Jogues, were objective minds, and fought in their way for the world's welfare; sotheir lives to-day inspire us. But when the intellect, as in this Louis, is originally no larger than a pin's head, andcherishes ideas of God of corresponding smallness, the result, notwithstanding the heroism put forth, is on the wholerepulsive. Purity, we see in the object-lesson, is not the one thing needful; and it is better that a life should contractmany a dirt-mark, than forfeit usefulness in its efforts to remain unspotted.Proceeding onwards in our search of religious extravagance, we next come upon excesses of Tenderness and Charity.Here saintliness has to face the charge of preserving the unfit, and breeding parasites and beggars. 'Resist not evil,''Love your enemies,' these are saintly maxims of which men(Footnote continued from previous page)was occupied in writing booklets on sanctification—page after page of dreamy rhapsody. She proved to be one of a small group ofpersons who claim that entire salvation involves three steps instead of two; not only must there be conversion and sanctification, but athird, which they call 'crucifixion' or 'perfect redemption,' and which seems to bear the same relation to sanctification that this bears toconversion. She related how the Spirit had said to her, 'Stop going to church. Stop going to holiness meetings. Go to your own room andI will teach you.' She professes to care nothing for colleges, or preachers, or churches, but only cares to listen to what God says to her.Her description of her experience seemed entirely consistent; she is happy and contented, and her life is entirely satisfactory to herself.While listening to her own story, one was tempted to forget that it was from the life of a person who could not live by it in conjunctionwith her fellows.\""},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP323 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 53]Page 323of this world find it hard to speak without impatience. Are the men of this world right, or are the saints in possessionof the deeper range of truth?No simple answer is possible. Here, if anywhere, one feels the complexity of the moral life, and the mysteriousness ofthe way in which facts and ideals are interwoven.Perfect conduct is a relation between three terms: the actor, the objects for which he acts, and the recipients of theaction. In order that conduct should be abstractly perfect, all three terms, intention, execution, and reception, should besuited to one another. The best intention will fail if it either work by false means or address itself to the wrongrecipient. Thus no critic or estimator of the value of conduct can confine himself to the actor's animus alone, apartfrom the other elements of the performance. As there is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood by those who hear it,so reasonable arguments, challenges to magnanimity, and appeals to sympathy or justice, are folly when we aredealing with human crocodiles and boa-constrictors. The saint may simply give the universe into the hands of theenemy by his trustfulness. He may by non-resistance cut off his own survival.Herbert Spencer tells us that the perfect man's conduct will appear perfect only when the environment is perfect: to noinferior environment is it suitably adapted. We may paraphrase this by cordially admitting that saintly conduct wouldbe the most perfect conduct conceivable in an environment where all were saints already; but by adding that in anenvironment where few are saints, and many the exact reverse of saints, it must be ill adapted. We must franklyconfess, then, using our empirical common sense and ordinary practical prejudices, that in the world that actually is,the virtues of sympathy, charity, and non-resistance may be, and often have been, manifested in excess. The powersof darkness have systematically taken advantage of them. The whole modern scientific organization of charity is aconsequence of the failure of simply giving alms. The whole history of constitutional government is a commentary onthe excellence of resisting evil, and when one cheek is smitten, of smiting back and not turning the other cheek also."},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP324 hl[01 03 2011 00 30 55]Page 324You will agree to this in general, for in spite of the Gospel, in spite of Quakerism, in spite of Tolstoi, you believe infighting fire with fire, in shooting down usurpers, locking up thieves, and freezing out vagabonds and swindlers.And yet you are sure, as I am sure, that were the world confined to these hard-headed, hard-hearted, and hard-fistedmethods exclusively, were there no one prompt to help a brother first, and find out afterwards whether he wereworthy; no one willing to drown his private wrongs in pity for the wronger's person; no one ready to be duped many atime rather than live always on suspicion; no one glad to treat individuals passionately and impulsively rather than bygeneral rules of prudence; the world would be an infinitely worse place than it is now to live in. The tender grace, notof a day that is dead, but of a day yet to be born somehow, with the golden rule grown natural, would be cut out fromthe perspective of our imaginations.The saints, existing in this way, may, with their extravagances of human tenderness, be prophetic. Nay, innumerabletimes they have proved themselves prophetic. Treating those whom they met, in spite of the past, in spite of allappearances, as worthy, they have stimulated them to be worthy, miraculously transformed them by their radiantexample and by the challenge of their expectation.From this point of view we may admit the human charity which we find in all saints, and the great excess of it whichwe find in some saints, to be a genuinely creative social force, tending to make real a degree of virtue which it aloneis ready to assume as possible. The saints are authors, auctores, increasers, of goodness. The potentialities ofdevelopment in human souls are unfathomable. So many who seemed irretrievably hardened have in point of fact beensoftened, converted, regenerated, in ways that amazed the subjects even more than they surprised the spectators, thatwe never can be sure in advance of any man that his salvation by the way of love is hopeless.

St. Paul long ago made our ancestors familiar with the idea that every soul isvirtually sacred. Since Christ died for us all without exception, St. Paul said, we must despair of no one. This belief inthe essential sacredness of every one expresses itself to-day in all sorts of humane customs and reformatoryinstitutions, and in a growing aversion to the death penalty and to brutality in punishment. The saints, with theirextravagance of human tenderness, are the great torch-bearers of this belief, the tip of the wedge, the cleavers of thedarkness. Like the single drops which sparkle in the sun as they are flung far ahead of the advancing edge of a wave-crest or of a flood, they show the way and are forerunners. The world is not yet with them, so they often seem in themidst of the world's affairs to be preposterous. Yet they are impregnators of the world, vivifiers and animaters ofpotentialities of goodness which but for them would lie forever dormant. It is not possible to be quite as mean as wenaturally are, when they have passed before us. One fire kindles another; and without that over-trust in human worthwhich they show, the rest of us would lie in spiritual stagnancy.Momentarily considered, then, the saint may waste his tenderness and be the dupe and victim of his charitable fever,but the general function of his charity in social evolution is vital and essential. If things are ever to move upward,some one must be ready to take the first step, and assume the risk of it. No one who is not willing to try charity, to trynon-resistance as the saint is always willing, can tell whether these methods will or will not succeed. When they dosucceed, they are far more powerfully successful than force or worldly prudence. Force destroys enemies; and the bestthat can be said of prudence is that it keeps what we already have in safety. But non-resistance, when successful, turnsenemies into friends; and charity regenerates its objects. These saintly methods are, as I said, creative energies; andgenuine saints find in the elevated excitement with which their faith endows them an authority and impressivenesswhich makes them irresistible in situations where men of shallower nature cannot get on at all without the use ofworldly prudence.

Paton, for example,in the New Hebrides, among brutish Melanesian cannibals, preserves a charmed life by dint of it. When it comes to the point, no oneever dares actually to strike him. Native converts, inspired by him, showed analogous virtue. ''One of our chiefs, full of the Christ-kindled desire to seek and to save, sent a message to an inland chief, that he and four attendants would come on Sabbath and tell themthe gospel of Jehovah God. The reply came back sternly forbidding their visit, and threatening with death any Christian that approachedtheir village. Our chief sent in response a loving message, telling them that Jehovah had taught the Christians to return good for evil, andthat they would come unarmed to tell them the story of how the Son of God came into the world and died in order to bless and save hisenemies. The heathen chief sent back a stern and prompt reply once more: 'If you come, you will be killed.' On Sabbath morn theChristian chief and his four companions were met outside the village by the heathen chief, who implored and threatened them once more.But the former said:—\"'We come to you without weapons of war! We come only to tell you about Jesus. We believe that He will protect us to-day.'\"As they pressed steadily forward towards the village, spears began to be thrown at them. Some they evaded, being all except one dexterouswarriors; and others they literally received with their bare hands, and turned them aside in an incredible manner. The heathen, apparentlythunderstruck at these men thus approaching them without weapons of war, and not even flinging back their own spears which they hadcaught, after having thrown what the old chief called 'a shower of spears,' desisted from mere surprise. Our Christian chief called out, as heand his companions drew up in the midst of them on the village public ground:—\"'Jehovah thus protects us. He has given us all your spears! Once we would have thrown them back at you and killed you. But now we come,not to fight but to tell you about Jesus. He has changed our dark hearts. He asks you now to lay down all these your other weapons of war,and to hear what we can tell you about the love of God, our great Father, the only living God.'\"The heathen were perfectly overawed. They manifestly looked on these Christians as protected by some Invisible One. They listened for thefirst time to the story of the Gospel and of the Cross. We lived to see that chief and all his tribe sitting in the school of Christ. And there isperhaps not an island in these southern seas, amongst all those won for Christ, where similar acts of heroism on the part of converts cannotbe recited.\" JOHN G.

They help to break the edge of the general reign of hardness, and are slowleavens of a better order.The next topic in order is Asceticism, which I fancy you are all ready to consider without argument a virtue liable toextravagance and excess. The optimism and refinement of the modern imagination has, as I have already saidelsewhere, changed the attitude of the church towards corporeal mortification, and a Suso or a Saint Peter ofAlcantara1 appear to us to-day rather in the light of tragic mountebanks than of sane men inspiring us with respect. Ifthe inner dispositions are right, we ask, what need of all this torment, this violation of the outer nature? It keeps theouter nature too important. Any one who is genuinely emancipated from the flesh will look on pleasures and pains,abundance and privation, as alike irrelevant and indifferent. He can engage in actions and experience enjoymentswithout fear of corruption or enslavement. As the Bhagavad-Gita says, only those need renounce worldly actions whoare still inwardly attached thereto. If one be really unattached to the fruits of action, one may mix in1Saint Peter, Saint Teresa tells us in her autobiography (French translation, p. 333), \"had passed forty years without ever sleeping morethan an hour and a half a day. Of all his mortifications, this was the one that had cost him the most. To compass it, he kept always on hisknees or on his feet. The little sleep he allowed nature to take was snatched in a sitting posture, his head leaning against a piece of woodfixed in the wall. Even had he wished to lie down, it would have been impossible, because his cell was only four feet and a half long. Inthe course of all these years he never raised his hood, no matter what the ardor of the sun or the rain's strength. He never put on a shoe.He wore a garment of coarse sackcloth, with nothing else upon his skin. This garment was as scant as possible, and over it a little cloakof the same stuff. When the cold was great he took off the cloak and opened for a while the door and little window of his cell. Then heclosed them and resumed the mantle,—his way, as he told us, of warming himself, and making his body feel a better temperature. It wasa frequent thing with him to eat(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP328 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 06]Page 328the world with equanimity. I quoted in a former lecture Saint Augustine's antinomian saying: If you only love Godenough, you may safely follow all your inclinations. \"He needs no devotional practices,\" is one of Ramakrishna'smaxims, \"whose heart is moved to tears at the mere mention of the name of Hari.\"1 And the Buddha, in pointing outwhat he called 'the middle way' to his disciples, told them to abstain from both extremes, excessive mortificationbeing as unreal and unworthy as mere desire and pleasure. The only perfect life, he said, is that of inner wisdom,which makes one thing as indifferent to us as another, and thus leads to rest, to peace, and to Nirvâna.2We find accordingly that as ascetic saints have grown older, and directors of conscience more experienced, theyusually have shown a tendency to lay less stress on special bodily mortifications. Catholic teachers have alwaysprofessed the rule that, since health is needed for efficiency in God's service, health must not be sacrificed tomortification. The general optimism and healthy-mindedness of liberal Protestant circles to-day makes mortificationfor mortification's sake repugnant to us. We can no longer sympathize with cruel deities, and the notion that God cantake delight in the spectacle of sufferings self-inflicted in his honor is abhorrent. In consequence of all these motivesyou probably are disposed, unless some(Footnote continued from previous page)once only in three days; and when I expressed my surprise, he said that it was very easy if one once had acquired the habit. One of hiscompanions has assured me that he has gone sometimes eight days without food. His poverty was extreme; and his mortification, evenin his youth, was such that he told me he had passed three years in a house of his order without knowing any of the monks otherwisethan by the sound of their voice, for he never raised his eyes, and only found his way about by following the others. He showed thissame modesty on public highways. He spent many years without ever laying eyes upon a woman; but he confessed to me that at the agehe had reached it was indifferent to him whether he laid eyes on them or not. He was very old when I first came to know him, and hisbody so attenuated that it seemed formed of nothing so much as of so many roots of trees. With all this sanctity he was very affable. Henever spoke unless he was questioned, but his intellectual right-mindedness and grace gave to all his words an irresistible charm.\"1F.

For in its spiritual meaning asceticism stands for nothing less than for the essence of the twice-bornphilosophy. It symbolizes, lamely enough no doubt, but sincerely, the belief that there is an element of real wrongnessin this world, which is neither to be ignored nor evaded, but which must be squarely met and overcome by an appealto the soul's heroic resources, and neutralized and cleansed away by suffering. As against this view, the ultra-optimistic form of the once-born philosophy thinks we may treat evil by the method of ignoring. Let a man who, byfortunate health and circumstances, escapes the suffering of any great amount of evil in his own person, also close hiseyes to it as it exists in the wider universe outside his private experience, and he will be quit of it altogether, and cansail through life happily on a healthy-minded basis. But we saw in our lectures on melancholy how precarious thisattempt necessarily is. Moreover it is but for the individual; and leaves the evil outside of him unredeemed andunprovided for in his philosophy.No such attempt can be a general solution of the problem; and to minds of sombre tinge, who naturally feel life as atragic mystery, such optimism is a shallow dodge or mean evasion. It accepts, in lieu of a real deliverance, what is alucky personal accident merely, a cranny to escape by. It leaves the general world unhelped and still in the clutch ofSatan. The real deliverance, the twice-born folk insist, must be of universal application. Pain and wrong and deathmust be fairly met and overcome in higher excitement, or else their sting remains essentially unbroken. If one hasever taken the fact of the prevalence of tragic death in this world's history fairly into his mind,—freezing, drowning,entombment alive, wild beasts, worse men, and hideous diseases,—he can with difficulty, it seems to me, continue hisown career of worldly prosperity without suspecting that he may all the while not be really inside the game, that hemay lack the great initiation."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP330 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 10]Page 330Well, this is exactly what asceticism thinks; and it voluntarily takes the initiation. Life is neither farce nor genteelcomedy, it says, but something we must sit at in mourning garments, hoping its bitter taste will purge us of our folly.The wild and the heroic are indeed such rooted parts of it that healthy-mindedness pure and simple, with itssentimental optimism, can hardly be regarded by any thinking man as a serious solution. Phrases of neatness, cosiness,and comfort can never be an answer to the sphinx's riddle.In these remarks I am leaning only upon mankind's common instinct for reality, which in point of fact has always heldthe world to be essentially a theatre for heroism. In heroism, we feel, life's supreme mystery is hidden. We tolerate noone who has no capacity whatever for it in any direction. On the other hand, no matter what a man's frailties otherwisemay be, if he be willing to risk death, and still more if he suffer it heroically, in the service he has chosen, the factconsecrates him forever. Inferior to ourselves in this or that way, if yet we cling to life, and he is able 'to fling it awaylike a flower' as caring nothing for it, we account him in the deepest way our born superior. Each of us in his ownperson feels that a high-hearted indifference to life would expiate all his short-comings.The metaphysical mystery, thus recognized by common sense, that he who feeds on death that feeds on men possesseslife supereminently and excellently, and meets best the secret demands of the universe, is the truth of whichasceticism has been the faithful champion. The folly of the cross, so inexplicable by the intellect, has yet itsindestructible vital meaning.Representatively, then, and symbolically, and apart from the vagaries into which the unenlightened intellect of formertimes may have let it wander, asceticism must, I believe, be acknowledged to go with the profounder way of handlingthe gift of existence. Naturalistic optimism is mere syllabub and flattery and sponge-cake in comparison. The practicalcourse of action for us, as religious men, would therefore, it seems to me, not be simply to turn our backs upon theascetic impulse, as most of us to-day turn them, but rather to discover some outlet for it of which the fruits in the wayof privation and hardship might be objectively useful. The older monastic"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP331 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 24]Page 331asceticism occupied itself with pathetic futilities, or terminated in the mere egotism of the individual, increasing hisown perfection.1 But is it not possible for us to discard most of these older forms of mortification, and yet find sanerchannels for the heroism which inspired them?Does not, for example, the worship of material luxury and wealth, which constitutes so large a portion of the 'spirit' ofour age, make somewhat for effeminacy and unmanliness? Is not the exclusively sympathetic and facetious way inwhich most children are brought up to-day—so different from the education of a hundred years ago, especially inevangelical circles—in danger, in spite of its many advantages, of developing a certain trashiness of fibre? Are therenot hereabouts some points of application for a renovated and revised ascetic discipline?Many of you would recognize such dangers, but would point to athletics, militarism, and individual and nationalenterprise and adventure as the remedies. These contemporary ideals are quite as remarkable for the energy withwhich they make for heroic standards of life, as contemporary religion is remarkable for the way in which it neglectsthem.2 War and adventure assuredly keep all who engage in them from treating themselves too tenderly. They demandsuch incredible efforts, depth beyond depth of exertion, both in degree and in duration, that the whole scale ofmotivation alters. Discomfort and annoyance, hunger and wet, pain and cold, squalor and filth, cease to have anydeterrent operation whatever. Death turns into a commonplace matter, and its usual power to check our actionvanishes. With the annulling of these customary inhibitions, ranges of new energy are set free, and life seems castupon a higher plane of power.The beauty of war in this respect is that it is so congruous with ordinary human nature. Ancestral evolution has madeus1\"The vanities of all others may die out, but the vanity of a saint as regards his sainthood is hard indeed to wear away.\" Ramakrishna, hisLife and Sayings, 1899, p. 172.2\"When a church has to be run by oysters, ice-cream, and fun,\" I read in an American religious paper, \"you may be sure that it is runningaway from Christ.\" Such, if one may judge by appearances, is the present plight of many of our churches."},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP332 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 26]Page 332all potential warriors; so the most insignificant individual, when thrown into an army in the field, is weaned fromwhatever excess of tenderness towards his precious person he may bring with him, and may easily develop into amonster of insensibility.But when we compare the military type of self-severity with that of the ascetic saint, we find a world-wide differencein all their spiritual concomitants.\"'Live and let live,'\" writes a clear-headed Austrian officer, \"is no device for an army. Contempt for one's owncomrades, for the troops of the enemy, and, above all, fierce contempt for one's own person, are what war demands ofevery one. Far better is it for an army to be too savage, too cruel, too barbarous, than to possess too muchsentimentality and human reasonableness. If the soldier is to be good for anything as a soldier, he must be exactly theopposite of a reasoning and thinking man. The measure of goodness in him is his possible use in war. War, and evenpeace, require of the soldier absolutely peculiar standards of morality. The recruit brings with him common moralnotions, of which he must seek immediately to get rid. For him victory, success, must be everything. The mostbarbaric tendencies in men come to life again in war, and for war's uses they are incommensurably good.\"1These words are of course literally true. The immediate aim of the soldier's life is, as Moltke said, destruction, andnothing but destruction; and whatever constructions wars result in are remote and non-military. Consequently thesoldier cannot train himself to be too feelingless to all those usual sympathies and respects, whether for persons or forthings, that make for conservation. Yet the fact remains that war is a school of strenuous life and heroism; and, beingin the line of aboriginal instinct, is the only school that as yet is universally available. But when we gravely askourselves whether this wholesale organization of irrationality and crime be our only bulwark against effeminacy, westand aghast at the thought, and think more kindly of ascetic religion. One hears of the mechanical equivalent of heat.What we now need to discover1C. V. B. K.: Friedens- und Kriegs-moral der Heere.

I have oftenthought that in the old monkish poverty-worship, in spite of the pedantry which infested it, there might be somethinglike that moral equivalent of war which we are seeking. May not voluntarily accepted poverty be 'the strenuous life,'without the need of crushing weaker peoples?Poverty indeed is the strenuous life,—without brass bands or uniforms or hysteric popular applause or lies orcircumlocutions; and when one sees the way in which wealth-getting enters as an ideal into the very bone and marrowof our generation, one wonders whether a revival of the belief that poverty is a worthy religious vocation may not be'the transformation of military courage,' and the spiritual reform which our time stands most in need of.Among us English-speaking peoples especially do the praises of poverty need once more to be boldly sung. We havegrown literally afraid to be poor. We despise any one who elects to be poor in order to simplify and save his innerlife. If he does not join the general scramble and pant with the money-making street, we deem him spiritless andlacking in ambition. We have lost the power even of imagining what the ancient idealization of poverty could havemeant: the liberation from material attachments, the unbribed soul, the manlier indifference, the paying our way bywhat we are or do and not by what we have, the right to fling away our life at any moment irresponsibly,—the moreathletic trim, in short, the moral fighting shape. When we of the so-called better classes are scared as men were neverscared in history at material ugliness and hardship; when we put off marriage until our house can be artistic, andquake at the thought of having a child without a bank-account and doomed to manual labor, it is time for thinkingmen to protest against so unmanly and irreligious a state of opinion.It is true that so far as wealth gives time for ideal ends and exercise to ideal energies, wealth is better than poverty andought to be chosen. But wealth does this in only a portion of the actual cases. Elsewhere the desire to gain wealth andthe"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP334 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 29]Page 334fear to lose it are our chief breeders of cowardice and propagators of corruption. There are thousands of conjuncturesin which a wealth-bound man must be a slave, whilst a man for whom poverty has no terrors becomes a freeman.Think of the strength which personal indifference to poverty would give us if we were devoted to unpopular causes.We need no longer hold our tongues or fear to vote the revolutionary or reformatory ticket. Our stocks might fall, ourhopes of promotion vanish, our salaries stop, our club doors close in our faces; yet, while we lived, we wouldimperturbably bear witness to the spirit, and our example would help to set free our generation. The cause would needits funds, but we its servants would be potent in proportion as we personally were contented with our poverty.I recommend this matter to your serious pondering, for it is certain that the prevalent fear of poverty among theeducated classes is the worst moral disease from which our civilization suffers.I have now said all that I can usefully say about the several fruits of religion as they are manifested in saintly lives, soI will make a brief review and pass to my more general conclusions.Our question, you will remember, is as to whether religion stands approved by its fruits, as these are exhibited in thesaintly type of character. Single attributes of saintliness may, it is true, be temperamental endowments, found in non-religious individuals. But the whole group of them forms a combination which, as such, is religious, for it seems toflow from the sense of the divine as from its psychological centre. Whoever possesses strongly this sense comesnaturally to think that the smallest details of this world derive infinite significance from their relation to an unseendivine order. The thought of this order yields him a superior denomination of happiness, and a steadfastness of soulwith which no other can compare. In social relations his serviceability is exemplary; he abounds in impulses to help.His help is inward as well as outward, for his sympathy reaches souls as well as bodies, and kindles unsuspectedfaculties therein. Instead of placing happiness where common men place it, in comfort, he places it in a higher kind ofinner excitement, which converts dis-"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP335 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 30]Page 335comforts into sources of cheer and annuls unhappiness. So he turns his back upon no duty, however thankless; andwhen we are in need of assistance, we can count upon the saint lending his hand with more certainty than we cancount upon any other person. Finally, his humble-mindedness and his ascetic tendencies save him from the pettypersonal pretensions which so obstruct our ordinary social intercourse, and his purity gives us in him a clean man fora companion. Felicity, purity, charity, patience, self-severity,—these are splendid excellencies, and the saint of allmen shows them in the completest possible measure.But, as we saw, all these things together do not make saints infallible. When their intellectual outlook is narrow, theyfall into all sorts of holy excesses, fanaticism or theopathic absorption, self-torment, prudery, scrupulosity, gullibility,and morbid inability to meet the world. By the very intensity of his fidelity to the paltry ideals with which an inferiorintellect may inspire him, a saint can be even more objectionable and damnable than a superficial carnal man wouldbe in the same situation. We must judge him not sentimentally only, and not in isolation, but using our ownintellectual standards, placing him in his environment, and estimating his total function.Now in the matter of intellectual standards, we must bear in mind that it is unfair, where we find narrowness of mind,always to impute it as a vice to the individual, for in religious and theological matters he probably absorbs hisnarrowness from his generation. Moreover, we must not confound the essentials of saintliness, which are thosegeneral passions of which I have spoken, with its accidents, which are the special determinations of these passions atany historical moment. In these determinations the saints will usually be loyal to the temporary idols of their tribe.Taking refuge in monasteries was as much an idol of the tribe in the middle ages, as bearing a hand in the world'swork is to-day. Saint Francis or Saint Bernard, were they living to-day, would undoubtedly be leading consecratedlives of some sort, but quite as undoubtedly they would not lead them in retirement. Our animosity to special historicmanifestations must not lead us to give away the saintly impulses in their essential nature to the tender mercies ofinimical critics."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP336 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 32]Page 336The most inimical critic of the saintly impulses whom I know is Nietzsche. He contrasts them with the worldlypassions as we find these embodied in the predaceous military character, altogether to the advantage of the latter. Yourborn saint, it must be confessed, has something about him which often makes the gorge of a carnal man rise, so it willbe worth while to consider the contrast in question more fully.Dislike of the saintly nature seems to be a negative result of the biologically useful instinct of welcoming leadership,and glorifying the chief of the tribe. The chief is the potential, if not the actual tyrant, the masterful, overpoweringman of prey. We confess our inferiority and grovel before him. We quail under his glance, and are at the same timeproud of owning so dangerous a lord. Such instinctive and submissive hero-worship must have been indispensable inprimeval tribal life. In the endless wars of those times, leaders were absolutely needed for the tribe's survival. If therewere any tribes who owned no leaders, they can have left no issue to narrate their doom. The leaders always had goodconsciences, for conscience in them coalesced with will, and those who looked on their face were as much smittenwith wonder at their freedom from inner restraint as with awe at the energy of their outward performances.Compared with these beaked and taloned graspers of the world, saints are herbivorous animals, tame and harmlessbarn-yard poultry. There are saints whose beard you may, if you ever care to, pull with impunity. Such a man excitesno thrills of wonder veiled in terror; his conscience is full of scruples and returns; he stuns us neither by his inwardfreedom nor his outward power; and unless he found within us an altogether different faculty of admiration to appealto, we should pass him by with contempt.In point of fact, he does appeal to a different faculty. Reënacted in human nature is the fable of the wind, the sun, andthe traveler. The sexes embody the discrepancy. The woman loves the man the more admiringly the stormier he showshimself, and the world deifies its rulers the more for being willful and unaccountable. But the woman in turnsubjugates the man by the mystery of gentleness in beauty, and the saint has always charmed the world by somethingsimilar. Mankind"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP337 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 33]Page 337is susceptible and suggestible in opposite directions, and the rivalry of influences is unsleeping. The saintly and theworldly ideal pursue their feud in literature as much as in real life.For Nietzsche the saint represents little but sneakingness and slavishness. He is the sophisticated invalid, thedegenerate par excellence, the man of insufficient vitality. His prevalence would put the human type in danger.''The sick are the greatest danger for the well. The weaker, not the stronger, are the strong's undoing. It is not fearof our fellow-man, which we should wish to see diminished; for fear rouses those who are strong to becometerrible in turn themselves, and preserves the hard-earned and successful type of humanity. What is to be dreadedby us more than any other doom is not fear, but rather the great disgust, not fear, but rather the great pity—disgustand pity for our human fellows. The morbid are our greatest peril—not the 'bad' men, not the predatory beings.Those born wrong, the miscarried, the broken—they it is, the weakest, who are undermining the vitality of therace, poisoning our trust in life, and putting humanity in question. Every look of them is a sigh,—'Would I weresomething other! I am sick and tired of what I am.' In this swamp-soil of self-contempt, every poisonous weedflourishes, and all so small, so secret, so dishonest, and so sweetly rotten. Here swarm the worms of sensitivenessand resentment; here the air smells odious with secrecy, with what is not to be acknowledged; here is wovenendlessly the net of the meanest of conspiracies, the conspiracy of those who suffer against those who succeedand are victorious; here the very aspect of the victorious is hated—as if health, success, strength, pride, and thesense of power were in themselves things vicious, for which one ought eventually to make bitter expiation. Oh,how these people would themselves like to inflict the expiation, how they thirst to be the hangmen! And all thewhile their duplicity never confesses their hatred to be hatred.\"1Poor Nietzsche's antipathy is itself sickly enough, but we all1Zur Genealogie der Moral, Dritte Abhandlung, § 14.

The carnivorous-minded 'strong man,'the adult male and cannibal, can see nothing but mouldiness and morbidness in the saint's gentleness and self-severity,and regards him with pure loathing. The whole feud revolves essentially upon two pivots: Shall the seen world or theunseen world be our chief sphere of adaptation? and must our means of adaptation in this seen world beaggressiveness or non-resistance?The debate is serious. In some sense and to some degree both worlds must be acknowledged and taken account of;and in the seen world both aggressiveness and non-resistance are needful. It is a question of emphasis, of more orless. Is the saint's type or the strong-man's type the more ideal?It has often been supposed, and even now, I think, it is supposed by most persons, that there can be one intrinsicallyideal type of human character. A certain kind of man, it is imagined, must be the best man absolutely and apart fromthe utility of his function, apart from economical considerations. The saint's type, and the knight's or gentleman's type,have always been rival claimants of this absolute ideality; and in the ideal of military religious orders both types werein a manner blended. According to the empirical philosophy, however, all ideals are matters of relation. It would beabsurd, for example, to ask for a definition of 'the ideal horse,' so long as dragging drays and running races, bearingchildren, and jogging about with tradesmen's packages all remain as indispensable differentiations of equine function.You may take what you call a general all-round animal as a compromise, but he will be inferior to any horse of amore specialized type, in some one particular direction. We must not forget this now when, in discussing saintliness,we ask if it be an ideal type of manhood. We must test it by its economical relations.I think that the method which Mr. Spencer uses in his Data of Ethics will help to fix our opinion. Ideality in conduct isaltogether a matter of adaptation. A society where all were invariably aggressive would destroy itself by inner friction,and in a society where some are aggressive, others must be non-resistant, if there is to be any kind of order. This isthe present constitution of society, and to the mixture we owe"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP339 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 41]Page 339many of our blessings. But the aggressive members of society are always tending to become bullies, robbers, andswindlers; and no one believes that such a state of things as we now live in is the millennium. It is meanwhile quitepossible to conceive an imaginary society in which there should be no aggressiveness, but only sympathy and fairness,—any small community of true friends now realizes such a society. Abstractly considered, such a society on a largescale would be the millennium, for every good thing might be realized there with no expense of friction. To such amillennial society the saint would be entirely adapted. His peaceful modes of appeal would be efficacious over hiscompanions, and there would be no one extant to take advantage of his non-resistance. The saint is thereforeabstractly a higher type of man than the 'strong man,' because he is adapted to the highest society conceivable,whether that society ever be concretely possible or not. The strong man would immediately tend by his presence tomake that society deteriorate. It would become inferior in everything save in a certain kind of bellicose excitement,dear to men as they now are.But if we turn from the abstract question to the actual situation, we find that the individual saint may be well or illadapted, according to particular circumstances. There is, in short, no absoluteness in the excellence of sainthood. Itmust be confessed that as far as this world goes, any one who makes an out-and saint of himself does so at his peril.If he is not a large enough man, he may appear more insignificant and contemptible, for all his saintship, than if hehad remained a worldling.1 Accordingly religion has seldom been so radically taken in our Western world that thedevotee could not mix it with some worldly temper. It has always found good men who could follow most of itsimpulses, but who stopped short when it came to non-resistance. Christ himself was fierce upon occasion. Cromwells,Stonewall Jacksons, Gordons, show that Christians can be strong men also.1We all know daft saints, and they inspire a queer kind of aversion. But in comparing saints with strong men we must choose individualson the same intellectual level. The under-witted strong man, homologous in his sphere with the under-witted saint, is the bully of theslums, the hooligan or rowdy. Surely on this level also the saint preserves a certain superiority."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP340 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 44]Page 340How is success to be absolutely measured when there are so many environments and so many ways of looking at theadaptation? It cannot be measured absolutely; the verdict will vary according to the point of view adopted. From thebiological point of view Saint Paul was a failure, because he was beheaded. Yet he was magnificently adapted to thelarger environment of history; and so far as any saint's example is a leaven of righteousness in the world, and draws itin the direction of more prevalent habits of saintliness, he is a success, no matter what his immediate bad fortune maybe. The greatest saints, the spiritual heroes whom every one acknowledges, the Francises, Bernards, Luthers, Loyolas,Wesleys, Channings, Moodys, Gratrys, the Phillips Brookses, the Agnes Joneses, Margaret Hallahans, and DoraPattisons, are successes from the outset. They show themselves, and there is no question; every one perceives theirstrength and stature. Their sense of mystery in things, their passion, their goodness, irradiate about them and enlargetheir outlines while they soften them. They are like pictures with an atmosphere and background; and, placedalongside of them, the strong men of this world and no other seem as dry as sticks, as hard and crude as blocks ofstone or brickbats.In a general way, then, and 'on the whole,'1 our abandonment of theological criteria, and our testing of religion bypractical common sense and the empirical method, leave it in possession of its towering place in history.Economically, the saintly group of qualities is indispensable to the world's welfare. The great saints are immediatesuccesses; the smaller ones are at least heralds and harbingers, and they may be leavens also, of a better mundaneorder. Let us be saints, then, if we can, whether or not we succeed visibly and temporally. But in our Father's houseare many mansions, and each of us must discover for himself the kind of religion and the amount of saintship whichbest comports with what he believes to be his powers and feels to be his truest mission and vocation. There are nosuccesses to be guaranteed and no set orders to be given to individuals, so long as we follow the methods of empiricalphilosophy.1See above, p. 300."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP341 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 45]Page 341This is my conclusion so far. I know that on some of your minds it leaves a feeling of wonder that such a methodshould have been applied to such a subject, and this in spite of all those remarks about empiricism which I made atthe beginning of Lecture XIV.1 How, you say, can religion, which believes in two worlds and an invisible order, beestimated by the adaptation of its fruits to this world's order alone? It is its truth, not its utility, you insist, upon whichour verdict ought to depend. If religion is true, its fruits are good fruits, even though in this world they should proveuniformly ill adapted and full of naught but pathos. It goes back, then, after all, to the question of the truth oftheology. The plot inevitably thickens upon us; we cannot escape theoretical considerations. I propose, then, that tosome degree we face the responsibility. Religious persons have often, though not uniformly, professed to see truth in aspecial manner. That manner is known as mysticism. I will consequently now proceed to treat at some length ofmystical phenomena, and after that, though more briefly, I will consider religious philosophy.1Above, pp. 300 305."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP342 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 47]Page 342Lectures XVI and XVIIMysticismOver and over again in these lectures I have raised points and left them open and unfinished until we should havecome to the subject of Mysticism. Some of you, I fear, may have smiled as you noted my reiterated postponements.But now the hour has come when mysticism must be faced in good earnest, and those broken threads wound uptogether. One may say truly, I think, that personal religious experience has its root and centre in mystical states ofconsciousness; so for us, who in these lectures are treating personal experience as the exclusive subject of our study,such states of consciousness ought to form the vital chapter from which the other chapters get their light. Whether mytreatment of mystical states will shed more light or darkness, I do not know, for my own constitution shuts me outfrom their enjoyment almost entirely, and I can speak of them only at second hand. But though forced to look uponthe subject so externally, I will be as objective and receptive as I can; and I think I shall at least succeed in convincingyou of the reality of the states in question, and of the paramount importance of their function.First of all, then, I ask, What does the expression 'mystical states of consciousness' mean? How do we part offmystical states from other states?The words 'mysticism' and 'mystical' are often used as terms of mere reproach, to throw at any opinion which weregard as vague and vast and sentimental, and without a base in either facts or logic. For some writers a 'mystic' is anyperson who believes in thought-transference, or spirit-return. Employed in this way the word has little value: there aretoo many less ambiguous synonyms. So, to keep it useful by restricting it, I will do what I did in the case of the word'religion,' and simply propose to you four marks which, when an experience has them, may justify us in calling itmystical for the purpose of the present lectures. In this way we shall save verbal disputation, and the recriminationsthat generally go therewith."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP343 hl[01 03 2011 00 31 48]Page 3431. Ineffability.—The handiest of the marks by which I classify a state of mind as mystical is negative. The subject of itimmediately says that it defies expression, that no adequate report of its contents can be given in words. It followsfrom this that its quality must be directly experienced; it cannot be imparted or transferred to others. In this peculiaritymystical states are more like states of feeling than like states of intellect. No one can make clear to another who hasnever had a certain feeling, in what the quality or worth of it consists. One must have musical ears to know the valueof a symphony; one must have been in love one's self to understand a lover's state of mind. Lacking the heart or ear,we cannot interpret the musician or the lover justly, and are even likely to consider him weak-minded or absurd. Themystic finds that most of us accord to his experiences an equally incompetent treatment.2. Noetic quality.—Although so similar to states of feeling, mystical states seem to those who experience them to bealso states of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect. They areilluminations, revelations, full of significance and importance, all inarticulate though they remain; and as a rule theycarry with them a curious sense of authority for after-time.These two characters will entitle any state to be called mystical, in the sense in which I use the word. Two otherqualities are less sharply marked, but are usually found. These are:—3. Transiency.—Mystical states cannot be sustained for long. Except in rare instances, half an hour, or at most an houror two, seems to be the limit beyond which they fade into the light of common day. Often, when faded, their qualitycan but imperfectly be reproduced in memory; but when they recur it is recognized; and from one recurrence toanother it is susceptible of continuous development in what is felt as inner richness and importance.4. Passivity.—Although the oncoming of mystical states may be facilitated by preliminary voluntary operations, as byfixing the attention, or going through certain bodily performances, or in other ways which manuals of mysticismprescribe; yet when the characteristic sort of consciousness once has set in, the mystic feels as if his own will were inabeyance,"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP344 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 00]Page 344and indeed sometimes as if he were grasped and held by a superior power. This latter peculiarity connects mysticalstates with certain definite phenomena of secondary or alternative personality, such as prophetic speech, automaticwriting, or the mediumistic trance. When these latter conditions are well pronounced, however, there may be norecollection whatever of the phenomenon, and it may have no significance for the subject's usual inner life, to which,as it were, it makes a mere interruption. Mystical states, strictly so called, are never merely interruptive. Somememory of their content always remains, and a profound sense of their importance. They modify the inner life of thesubject between the times of their recurrence. Sharp divisions in this region are, however, difficult to make, and wefind all sorts of gradations and mixtures.These four characteristics are sufficient to mark out a group of states of consciousness peculiar enough to deserve aspecial name and to call for careful study. Let it then be called the mystical group.Our next step should be to gain acquaintance with some typical examples. Professional mystics at the height of theirdevelopment have often elaborately organized experiences and a philosophy based thereupon. But you remember whatI said in my first lecture: phenomena are best understood when placed within their series, studied in their germ and intheir over-ripe decay, and compared with their exaggerated and degenerated kindred. The range of mysticalexperience is very wide, much too wide for us to cover in the time at our disposal. Yet the method of serial study is soessential for interpretation that if we really wish to reach conclusions we must use it. I will begin, therefore, withphenomena which claim no special religious significance, and end with those of which the religious pretensions areextreme.The simplest rudiment of mystical experience would seem to be that deepened sense of the significance of a maxim orformula which occasionally sweeps over one. \"I've heard that said all my life,\" we exclaim, \"but I never realized itsfull meaning until now.\" ''When a fellow-monk,\" said Luther, \"one day repeated the words of the Creed: 'I believe inthe forgiveness of sins,' I saw the Scripture in an entirely new light;"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP345 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 01]Page 345and straightway I felt as if I were born anew. It was as if I had found the door of paradise thrown wide open.\"1 Thissense of deeper significance is not confined to rational propositions. Single words,2 and conjunctions of words, effectsof light on land and sea, odors and musical sounds, all bring it when the mind is tuned aright. Most of us canremember the strangely moving power of passages in certain poems read when we were young, irrational doorways asthey were through which the mystery of fact, the wildness and the pang of life, stole into our hearts and thrilled them.The words have now perhaps become mere polished surfaces for us; but lyric poetry and music are alive andsignificant only in proportion as they fetch these vague vistas of a life continuous with our own, beckoning andinviting, yet ever eluding our pursuit. We are alive or dead to the eternal inner message of the arts according as wehave kept or lost this mystical susceptibility.A more pronounced step forward on the mystical ladder is found in an extremely frequent phenomenon, that suddenfeeling, namely, which sometimes sweeps over us, of having 'been here before,' as if at some indefinite past time, injust this place, with just these people, we were already saying just these things. As Tennyson writes:\"Moreover, something is or seems,That touches me with mystic gleams,Like glimpses of forgotten dreams—\"Of something felt, like something here;Of something done, I know not where;Such as no language may declare.\"31Newman's Securus judicat orbis terrarum is another instance.2'Mesopotamia' is the stock comic instance.—An excellent old German lady, who had done some traveling in her day, used to describe to meher Sehnsucht that she might yet visit 'Philadelphia,' whose wondrous name had always haunted her imagination. Of John Foster it is said that\"single words (as chalcedony), or the names of ancient heroes, had a mighty fascination over him. 'At any time the word hermit was enoughto transport him.' The words woods and forests would produce the most powerful emotion.\" Foster's Life, by RYLAND, New York, 1846, p. 3.3The Two Voices. In a letter to Mr. B. P. Blood, Tennyson reports of himself as follows:—(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP346 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 03]Page 346Sir James Crichton-Browne has given the technical name of 'dreamy states' to these sudden invasions of vaguelyreminiscent consciousness.1 They bring a sense of mystery and of the metaphysical duality of things, and the feelingof an enlargement of perception which seems imminent but which never completes itself. In Dr. Crichton-Browne'sopinion they connect themselves with the perplexed and scared disturbances of self-consciousness which occasionallyprecede epileptic attacks. I think that this learned alienist takes a rather absurdly alarmist view of an intrinsicallyinsignificant phenomenon. He follows it along the downward ladder, to insanity; our path pursues the upward ladderchiefly. The divergence shows how important it is to neglect no part of a phenomenon's connections, for we make itappear admirable or dreadful according to the context by which we set it off.Somewhat deeper plunges into mystical consciousness are met with in yet other dreamy states. Such feelings as thesewhich Charles Kingsley describes are surely far from being uncommon, especially in youth:—\"When I walk the fields, I am oppressed now and then with an innate feeling that everything I see has a meaning, if I could butunderstand it. And this feeling of being surrounded with truths which I cannot grasp amounts to(Footnote continued from previous page)\"I have never had any revelations through anæsthetics, but a kind of waking trance—this for lack of a better word—I have frequentlyhad, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone. This has come upon me through repeating my own name to myself silently, tillall at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away intoboundless being, and this not a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the surest, utterly beyond words—where death was an almostlaughable impossibility—the loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction, but the only true life. I am ashamed of my feebledescription. Have I not said the state is utterly beyond words?\"Professor Tyndall, in a letter, recalls Tennyson saying of this condition: \"By God Almighty! there is no delusion in the matter! It is nonebulous ecstasy, but a state of transcendent wonder, associated with absolute clearness of mind.\" Memoirs of Alfred Tennyson, ii. 473.1The Lancet, July 6 and 13, 1895, reprinted as the Cavendish Lecture, on Dreamy Mental States, London, Baillière, 1895.

Have you not felt that your real soul was imperceptible to your mental vision, except in a few hallowedmoments?\"1A much more extreme state of mystical consciousness is described by J. A. Symonds; and probably more persons thanwe suspect could give parallels to it from their own experience.\"Suddenly,\" writes Symonds, \"at church, or in company, or when I was reading, and always, I think, when my muscles were at rest, I feltthe approach of the mood. Irresistibly it took possession of my mind and will, lasted what seemed an eternity, and disappeared in a seriesof rapid sensations which resembled the awakening from anæsthetic influence. One reason why I disliked this kind of trance was that Icould not describe it to myself. I cannot even now find words to render it intelligible. It consisted in a gradual but swiftly progressiveobliteration of space, time, sensation, and the multitudinous factors of experience which seem to qualify what we are pleased to call ourSelf. In proportion as these conditions of ordinary consciousness were subtracted, the sense of an underlying or essential consciousnessacquired intensity. At last nothing remained but a pure, absolute, abstract Self. The universe became without form and void of content.But Self persisted, formidable in its vivid keenness, feeling the most poignant doubt about reality, ready, as it seemed, to find existencebreak as breaks a bubble round about it. And what then? The apprehension of a coming dissolution, the grim conviction that this statewas the last state of the conscious Self, the sense that I had followed the last thread of being to the verge of the abyss, and had arrived atdemonstration of eternal Maya or illusion, stirred or seemed to stir me up again. The return to ordinary conditions of sentient existencebegan by my first recovering the power of touch, and then by the gradual though rapid influx of familiar impressions and diurnalinterests. At last I felt myself once more a human being; and though the riddle of what is meant by1Charles Kingsley's Life, i. 55, quoted by INGE: Christian Mysticism, London, 1899, p. 341."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP348 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 06]Page 348life remained unsolved, I was thankful for this return from the abyss—this deliverance from so awful an initiation into the mysteries ofskepticism.\"This trance recurred with diminishing frequency until I reached the age of twenty-eight. It served to impress upon my growing naturethe phantasmal unreality of all the circumstances which contribute to a merely phenomenal consciousness. Often have I asked myselfwith anguish, on waking from that formless state of denuded, keenly sentient being, Which is the unreality?—the trance of fiery, vacant,apprehensive, skeptical Self from which I issue, or these surrounding phenomena and habits which veil that inner Self and build a self offlesh-and-blood conventionality? Again, are men the factors of some dream, the dream-like unsubstantiality of which they comprehendat such eventful moments? What would happen if the final stage of the trance were reached?\"1In a recital like this there is certainly something suggestive of pathology.2 The next step into mystical states carries usinto a realm that public opinion and ethical philosophy have long since branded as pathological, though privatepractice and certain lyric strains of poetry seem still to bear witness to its ideality. I refer to the consciousnessproduced by intoxicants and anæsthetics, especially by alcohol. The sway of alcohol over mankind is unquestionablydue to its power to stimulate the mystical faculties of human nature, usually crushed to earth by the cold facts and drycriticisms of the sober hour. Sobriety diminishes, discriminates, and says no; drunkenness expands, unites, and saysyes. It is in fact the great exciter of the Yes function in man. It brings its votary from the chill periphery of things tothe radiant core. It makes1H. F. BROWN: J. A. Symonds, a Biography, London, 1895, pp. 29 31, abridged.2Crichton-Browne expressly says that Symonds's \"highest nerve centres were in some degree enfeebled or damaged by these dreamy mentalstates which afflicted him so grievously.\" Symonds was, however, a perfect monster of many-sided cerebral efficiency, and his critic gives noobjective grounds whatever for his strange opinion, save that Symonds complained occasionally, as all susceptible and ambitious mencomplain, of lassitude and uncertainty as to his life's mission."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP349 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 08]Page 349him for the moment one with truth. Not through mere perversity do men run after it. To the poor and the unlettered itstands in the place of symphony concerts and of literature; and it is part of the deeper mystery and tragedy of life thatwhiffs and gleams of something that we immediately recognize as excellent should be vouchsafed to so many of usonly in the fleeting earlier phases of what in its totality is so degrading a poisoning. The drunken consciousness is onebit of the mystic consciousness, and our total opinion of it must find its place in our opinion of that larger whole.Nitrous oxide and ether, especially nitrous oxide, when sufficiently diluted with air, stimulate the mysticalconsciousness in an extraordinary degree. Depth beyond depth of truth seems revealed to the inhaler. This truth fadesout, however, or escapes, at the moment of coming to; and if any words remain over in which it seemed to clotheitself, they prove to be the veriest nonsense. Nevertheless, the sense of a profound meaning having been there persists;and I know more than one person who is persuaded that in the nitrous oxide trance we have a genuine metaphysicalrevelation.Some years ago I myself made some observations on this aspect of nitrous oxide intoxication, and reported them inprint. One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time, and my impression of its truth has ever since remainedunshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type ofconsciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of consciousnessentirely different. We may go through life without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite stimulus, and at atouch they are there in all their completeness, definite types of mentality which probably somewhere have their fieldof application and adaptation. No account of the universe in its totality can be final which leaves these other forms ofconsciousness quite disregarded. How to regard them is the question,—for they are so discontinuous with ordinaryconsciousness. Yet they may determine attitudes though they cannot furnish formulas, and open a region though theyfail to give a map. At any rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with reality. Looking back on my ownexperiences, they all"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP350 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 11]Page 350converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance. The keynote of itis invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of the world, whose contradictoriness and conflict make all ourdifficulties and troubles, were melted into unity. Not only do they, as contrasted species, belong to one and the samegenus, but one of the species, the nobler and better one, is itself the genus, and so soaks up and absorbs its oppositeinto itself. This is a dark saying, I know, when thus expressed in terms of common logic, but I cannot wholly escapefrom its authority. I feel as if it must mean something, something like what the hegelian philosophy means, if onecould only lay hold of it more clearly. Those who have ears to hear, let them hear; to me the living sense of its realityonly comes in the artificial mystic state of mind.1I just now spoke of friends who believe in the anæsthetic revelation. For them too it is a monistic insight, in which theother in its various forms appears absorbed into the One.\"Into this pervading genius,\" writes one of them, \"we pass, forgetting and forgotten, and thenceforth each is all, in God. There is nohigher, no deeper, no other, than the life in which we are founded. 'The One remains, the many change and pass;' and each and every oneof us is the One that remains. This is the ultimatum. As sure as being—whence is all our care—so sure is content, beyond duplexity,antithesis, or trouble, where I have triumphed in a solitude that God is not above.\"21What reader of Hegel can doubt that that sense of a perfected Being with all its otherness soaked up into itself, which dominates hiswhole philosophy, must have come from the prominence in his consciousness of mystical moods like this, in most persons keptsubliminal? The notion is thoroughly characteristic of the mystical level, and the Aufgabe of making it articulate was surely set toHegel's intellect by mystical feeling.2BENJAMIN PAUL BLOOD: The Anæsthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy, Amsterdam, N. Y., 1874, pp. 35, 36. Mr. Blood has madeseveral attempts to adumbrate the anæsthetic revelation, in pamphlets of rare literary distinction, privately printed and distributed by himselfat Amsterdam. Xenos Clark, a philosopher, who died young at Amherst in the '80's, much lamented by those who knew him, was alsoimpressed by the revelation. \"In the first place,\" he once wrote to me, \"Mr. Blood and I agree that the revelation is, if anything, non-emotional. It is utterly flat. It is, as Mr. Blood says, 'the one(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP351 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 18]Page 351This has the genuine religious mystic ring! I just now quoted J. A. Symonds. He also records a mystical experiencewith chloroform, as follows:—(Footnote continued from previous page)sole and sufficient insight why, or not why, but how, the present is pushed on by the past, and sucked forward by the vacuity of thefuture. Its inevitableness defeats all attempts at stopping or accounting for it. It is all precedence and presupposition, and questioning is inregard to it forever too late. It is an initiation of the past.' The real secret would be the formula by which the 'now' keeps exfoliating outof itself, yet never escapes. What is it, indeed, that keeps existence exfoliating? The formal being of anything, the logical definition of it,is static. For mere logic every question contains its own answer—we simply fill the hole with the dirt we dug out. Why are twice twofour? Because, in fact, four is twice two. Thus logic finds in life no propulsion, only a momentum. It goes because it is a-going. But therevelation adds: it goes because it is and was a-going. You walk, as it were, round yourself in the revelation. Ordinary philosophy is likea hound hunting his own trail. The more he hunts the farther he has to go, and his nose never catches up with his heels, because it isforever ahead of them. So the present is already a foregone conclusion, and I am ever too late to understand it. But at the moment ofrecovery from anæsthesis, just then, before starting on life, I catch, so to speak, a glimpse of my heels, a glimpse of the eternal processjust in the act of starting. The truth is that we travel on a journey that was accomplished before we set out; and the real end of philosophyis accomplished, not when we arrive at, but when we remain in, our destination (being already there),—which may occur vicariously inthis life when we cease our intellectual questioning. That is why there is a smile upon the face of the revelation, as we view it. It tells usthat we are forever half a second too late—that's all. 'You could kiss your own lips, and have all the fun to yourself,' it says, if you onlyknew the trick. It would be perfectly easy if they would just stay there till you got round to them. Why don't you manage it somehow?\"Dialectically minded readers of this farrago will at least recognize the region of thought of which Mr. Clark writes, as familiar. In his latestpamphlet, 'Tennyson's Trances and the Anæsthetic Revelation,' Mr. Blood describes its value for life as follows:—\"The Anæsthetic Revelation is the Initiation of Man into the Immemorial Mystery of the Open Secret of Being, revealed as the InevitableVortex of Continuity. Inevitable is the word. Its motive is inherent—it is what has to be. It is not for any love or hate, nor for joy nor sorrow,nor good nor ill. End, beginning, or purpose, it knows not of.\"It affords no particular of the multiplicity and variety of things; but it fills appreciation of the historical and the sacred with a secular andintimately personal illumination of the nature and motive of existence, which then seems reminiscent—as if it should have appeared, or shallyet appear, to every participant thereof.\"Although it is at first startling in its solemnity, it becomes directly such a(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP352 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 20]Page 352\"After the choking and stifling had passed away, I seemed at first in a state of utter blankness; then came flashes of intense light,alternating with blackness, and with a keen vision of what was going on in the room around me, but no sensation of touch. I thought thatI was near death; when, suddenly, my soul became aware of God, who was manifestly dealing with me, handling me, so to speak, in anintense personal present reality. I felt him streaming in like light upon me. I cannot describe the ecstasy I felt. Then, as I graduallyawoke from the influence of the anæsthetics, the old sense of my relation to the world began to return, the new sense of my relation toGod began to fade. I suddenly leapt to my feet on the chair where I was sitting, and shrieked out, 'It is too horrible, it is too horrible, it istoo horrible,' meaning that I could not bear this(Footnote continued from previous page)matter of course—so old-fashioned, and so akin to proverbs, that it inspires exultation rather than fear, and a sense of safety, as identifiedwith the aboriginal and the universal. But no words may express the imposing certainty of the patient that he is realizing the primordial,Adamic surprise of Life.\"Repetition of the experience finds it ever the same, and as if it could not possibly be otherwise. The subject resumes his normalconsciousness only to partially and fitfully remember its occurrence, and to try to formulate its baffling import,—with only this consolatoryafterthought: that he has known the oldest truth, and that he has done with human theories as to the origin, meaning, or destiny of the race.He is beyond instruction in 'spiritual things.'\"The lesson is one of central safety: the Kingdom is within. All days are judgment days: but there can be no climacteric purpose of eternity,nor any scheme of the whole. The astronomer abridges the row of bewildering figures by increasing his unit of measurement: so may wereduce the distracting multiplicity of things to the unity for which each of us stands.\"This has been my moral sustenance since I have known of it. In my first printed mention of it I declared: 'The world is no more the alienterror that was taught me. Spurning the cloud-grimed and still sultry battlements whence so lately Jehovan thunders boomed, my gray gulllifts her wing against the nightfall, and takes the dim leagues with a fearless eye.' And now, after twenty-seven years of this experience, thewing is grayer, but the eye is fearless still, while I renew and doubly emphasize that declaration. I know—as having known—the meaning ofExistence: the sane centre of the universe—at once the wonder and the assurance of the soul—for which the speech of reason has as yet noname but the Anæsthetic Revelation.\"—I have considerably abridged the quotation."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP353 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 21]Page 353disillusionment. Then I flung myself on the ground, and at last awoke covered with blood, calling to the two surgeons (who werefrightened), 'Why did you not kill me? Why would you not let me die?' Only think of it. To have felt for that long dateless ecstasy ofvision the very God, in all purity and tenderness and truth and absolute love, and then to find that I had after all had no revelation, butthat I had been tricked by the abnormal excitement of my brain.\"Yet, this question remains, Is it possible that the inner sense of reality which succeeded, when my flesh was dead to impressions fromwithout, to the ordinary sense of physical relations, was not a delusion but an actual experience? Is it possible that I, in that moment, feltwhat some of the saints have said they always felt, the undemonstrable but irrefragable certainty of God?\"11Op. cit., pp. 78 80, abridged. I subjoin, also abridging it, another interesting anæsthetic revelation communicated to me in manuscript bya friend in England. The subject, a gifted woman, was taking ether for a surgical operation.\"I wondered if I was in a prison being tortured, and why I remembered having heard it said that people 'learn through suffering,' and in viewof what I was seeing, the inadequacy of this saying struck me so much that I said, aloud, 'to suffer is to learn.'\"With that I became unconscious again, and my last dream immediately preceded my real coming to. It only lasted a few seconds, and wasmost vivid and real to me, though it may not be clear in words.\"A great Being or Power was traveling through the sky, his foot was on a kind of lightning as a wheel is on a rail, it was his pathway. Thelightning was made entirely of the spirits of innumerable people close to one another, and I was one of them. He moved in a straight line, andeach part of the streak or flash came into its short conscious existence only that he might travel. I seemed to be directly under the foot ofGod, and I thought he was grinding his own life up out of my pain. Then I saw that what he had been trying with all his might to do was tochange his course, to bend the line of lightning to which he was tied, in the direction in which he wanted to go. I felt my flexibility andhelplessness, and knew that he would succeed. He bended me, turning his corner by means of my hurt, hurting me more than I had ever beenhurt in my life, and at the acutest point of this, as he passed, I saw. I understood for a moment things that I have now forgotten, things that noone could remember while retaining sanity.

The phenomenon in one shape or another is not uncommon.(Footnote continued from previous page)acute angle, I should have both suffered and 'seen' still more, and should probably have died.''He went on and I came to. In that moment the whole of my life passed before me, including each little meaningless piece of distress, and Iunderstood them. This was what it had all meant, this was the piece of work it had all been contributing to do. I did not see God's purpose, Ionly saw his intentness and his entire relentlessness towards his means. He thought no more of me than a man thinks of hurting a cork whenhe is opening wine, or hurting a cartridge when he is firing. And yet, on waking, my first feeling was, and it came with tears, 'Domine nonsum digna,' for I had been lifted into a position for which I was too small. I realized that in that half hour under ether I had served God moredistinctly and purely than I had ever done in my life before, or than I am capable of desiring to do. I was the means of his achieving andrevealing something, I know not what or to whom, and that, to the exact extent of my capacity for suffering.\"While regaining consciousness, I wondered why, since I had gone so deep, I had seen nothing of what the saints call the love of God,nothing but his relentlessness. And then I heard an answer, which I could only just catch, saying, 'Knowledge and Love are One, and themeasure is suffering'—I give the words as they came to me. With that I came finally to (into what seemed a dream world compared with thereality of what I was leaving), and I saw that what would be called the 'cause' of my experience was a slight operation under insufficientether, in a bed pushed up against a window, a common city window in a common city street. If I had to formulate a few of the things I thencaught a glimpse of, they would run somewhat as follows:—\"The eternal necessity of suffering and its eternal vicariousness. The veiled and incommunicable nature of the worst sufferings;—thepassivity of genius, how it is essentially instrumental and defenseless, moved, not moving, it must do what it does;—the impossibility ofdiscovery without its price;—finally, the excess of what the suffering 'seer' or genius pays over what his generation gains. (He seems like onewho sweats his life out to earn enough to save a district from famine, and just as he staggers back, dying and satisfied, bringing a lac ofrupees to buy grain with, God lifts the lac away, dropping one rupee, and says, 'That you may give them. That you have earned for them. Therest is for ME.') I perceived also in a way never to be forgotten, the excess of what we see over what we can demonstrate.\"And so on!—these things may seem to you delusions, or truisms; but for me they are dark truths, and the power to put them into even suchwords as these has been given me by an ether dream.\""},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP355 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 24]Page 355\"I know,\" writes Mr. Trine, \"an officer on our police force who has told me that many times when off duty, and on his way home in theevening, there comes to him such a vivid and vital realization of his oneness with this Infinite Power, and this Spirit of Infinite Peace sotakes hold of and so fills him, that it seems as if his feet could hardly keep to the pavement, so buoyant and so exhilarated does hebecome by reason of this inflowing tide.\"1Certain aspects of nature seem to have a peculiar power of awakening such mystical moods.2 Most of the strikingcases which I have collected have occurred out of doors. Literature has commemorated this fact in many passages ofgreat beauty—this extract, for example, from Amiel's Journal In-time:—1In Tune with the Infinite, p. 137.2The larger God may then swallow up the smaller one. I take this from Starbuck's manuscript collection:—\"I never lost the consciousness of the presence of God until I stood at the foot of the Horseshoe Falls, Niagara. Then I lost him in theimmensity of what I saw. I also lost myself, feeling that I was an atom too small for the notice of Almighty God.\"I subjoin another similar case from Starbuck's collection:—\"In that time the consciousness of God's nearness came to me sometimes. I say God, to describe what is indescribable. A presence, I mightsay, yet that is too suggestive of personality, and the moments of which I speak did not hold the consciousness of a personality, but somethingin myself made me feel myself a part of something bigger than I, that was controlling. I felt myself one with the grass, the trees, birds,insects, everything in Nature. I exulted in the mere fact of existence, of being a part of it all—the drizzling rain, the shadows of the clouds,the tree-trunks, and so on. In the years following, such moments continued to come, but I wanted them constantly. I knew so well thesatisfaction of losing self in a perception of supreme power and love, that I was unhappy because that perception was not constant.\" Thecases quoted in my third lecture, pp. 66, 67, 70, are still better ones of this type. In her essay, The Loss of Personality, in The AtlanticMonthly (vol. lxxxv. p. 195), Miss Ethel D. Puffer explains that the vanishing of the sense of self, and the feeling of immediate unity with theobject, is due to the disappearance, in these rapturous experiences, of the motor adjustments which habitually intermediate between theconstant background of consciousness (which is the Self) and the object in the foreground, whatever it may be. I must refer the reader to thehighly instructive article, which seems to me to throw light upon the psychological conditions, though it fails to account for the rapture or therevelation-value of the experience in the Subject's eyes."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP356 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 36]Page 356\"Shall I ever again have any of those prodigious reveries which sometimes came to me in former days? One day, in youth, at sunrise,sitting in the ruins of the castle of Faucigny; and again in the mountains, under the noonday sun, above Lavey, lying at the foot of a treeand visited by three butterflies; once more at night upon the shingly shore of the Northern Ocean, my back upon the sand and my visionranging through the milky way;—such grand and spacious, immortal, cosmogonic reveries, when one reaches to the stars, when oneowns the infinite! Moments divine, ecstatic hours; in which our thought flies from world to world, pierces the great enigma, breatheswith a respiration broad, tranquil, and deep as the respiration of the ocean, serene and limitless as the blue firmament; instants ofirresistible intuition in which one feels one's self great as the universe, and calm as a god.

I felt that Iprayed as I had never prayed before, and knew now what prayer really is: to return from the solitude of individuation into theconsciousness of unity with all that is, to kneel down as one that passes away, and to rise up as one imperishable. Earth, heaven, and searesounded as in one vast world-encircling harmony. It was as if the chorus of all the great who had ever lived were about me.

I take it from the Autobiography of J. Trevor.2\"One brilliant Sunday morning, my wife and boys went to the Unitarian Chapel in Macclesfield. I felt it impossible to accompany them—as though to leave the sunshine on the hills, and go down there to the chapel, would be for the time an act of spiritual suicide. And Ifelt such need for new inspiration and expansion in my life. So, very reluctantly and sadly, I left my wife and boys to go down into thetown, while I went further up into the hills with my1Whitman in another place expresses in a quieter way what was probably with him a chronic mystical perception: \"There is,\" he writes,\"apart from mere intellect, in the make-up of every superior human identity, a wondrous something that realizes without argument,frequently without what is called education (though I think it the goal and apex of all education deserving the name), an intuition of theabsolute balance, in time and space, of the whole of this multifariousness, this revel of fools, and incredible make-believe and generalunsettledness, we call the world; a soul-sight of that divine clue and unseen thread which holds the whole congeries of things, all historyand time, and all events, however trivial, however momentous, like a leashed dog in the hand of the hunter. [Of] such soul-sight and root-centre for the mind mere optimism explains only the surface.\" Whitman charges it against Carlyle that he lacked this perception.Specimen Days and Collect, Philadelphia, 1882, p. 174.2My Quest for God, London, 1897, pp. 268, 269, abridged."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP358 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 39]Page 358stick and my dog. In the loveliness of the morning, and the beauty of the hills and valleys, I soon lost my sense of sadness and regret. Fornearly an hour I walked along the road to the 'Cat and Fiddle,' and then returned. On the way back, suddenly, without warning, I felt thatI was in Heaven—an inward state of peace and joy and assurance indescribably intense, accompanied with a sense of being bathed in awarm glow of light, as though the external condition had brought about the internal effect—a feeling of having passed beyond the body,though the scene around me stood out more clearly and as if nearer to me than before, by reason of the illumination in the midst of whichI seemed to be placed. This deep emotion lasted, though with decreasing strength, until I reached home, and for some time after, onlygradually passing away.\"The writer adds that having had further experiences of a similar sort, he now knows them well.\"The spiritual life,\" he writes, \"justifies itself to those who live it; but what can we say to those who do not understand? This, at least, wecan say, that it is a life whose experiences are proved real to their possessor, because they remain with him when brought closest intocontact with the objective realities of life. Dreams cannot stand this test. We wake from them to find that they are but dreams.Wanderings of an overwrought brain do not stand this test. These highest experiences that I have had of God's presence have been rareand brief—flashes of consciousness which have compelled me to exclaim with surprise—God is here!—or conditions of exaltation andinsight, less intense, and only gradually passing away. I have severely questioned the worth of these moments. To no soul have I namedthem, lest I should be building my life and work on mere phantasies of the brain. But I find that, after every questioning and test, theystand out to-day as the most real experiences of my life, and experiences which have explained and justified and unified all pastexperiences and all past growth.

It was in the most real seasons that the Real Presence came, and I was aware that Iwas immersed in the infinite ocean of God.\"1Even the least mystical of you must by this time be convinced of the existence of mystical moments as states ofconsciousness of an entirely specific quality, and of the deep impression which they make on those who have them. ACanadian psychiatrist, Dr. R. M. Bucke, gives to the more distinctly characterized of these phenomena the name ofcosmic consciousness. \"Cosmic consciousness in its more striking instances is not,\" Dr. Bucke says, \"simply anexpansion or extension of the self-conscious mind with which we are all familiar, but the superaddition of a functionas distinct from any possessed by the average man as self-consciousness is distinct from any function possessed byone of the higher animals.\"\"The prime characteristic of cosmic consciousness is a consciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the life and order of the universe. Alongwith the consciousness of the cosmos there occurs an intellectual enlightenment which alone would place the individual on a new plane ofexistence—would make him almost a member of a new species. To this is added a state of moral exaltation, an indescribable feeling ofelevation, elation, and joyousness, and a quickening of the moral sense, which is fully as striking, and more important than is theenhanced intellectual power. With these come what may be called a sense of immortality, a consciousness of eternal life, not a convictionthat he shall have this, but the consciousness that he has it already.\"2It was Dr. Bucke's own experience of a typical onset of cosmic consciousness in his own person which led him toinvestigate it in others. He has printed his conclusions in a1Op. cit., pp. 256, 257, abridged.2Cosmic Consciousness: a study in the evolution of the human Mind.

We parted at midnight. I had along drive in a hansom to my lodging. My mind, deeply under the influence of the ideas, images, and emotions called up by the readingand talk, was calm and peaceful. I was in a state of quiet, almost passive enjoyment, not actually thinking, but letting ideas, images, andemotions flow of themselves, as it were, through my mind. All at once, without warning of any kind, I found myself wrapped in a flame-colored cloud. For an instant I thought of fire, an immense conflagration somewhere close by in that great city; the next, I knew that thefire was within myself. Directly afterward there came upon me a sense of exultation, of immense joyousness accompanied orimmediately followed by an intellectual illumination impossible to describe. Among other things, I did not merely come to believe, but Isaw that the universe is not composed of dead matter, but is, on the contrary, a living Presence; I became conscious in myself of eternallife. It was not a conviction that I would have eternal life, but a consciousness that I possessed eternal life then; I saw that all men areimmortal; that the cosmic order is such that without any peradventure all things work together for the good of each and all; that thefoundation principle of the world, of all the worlds, is what we call love, and that the happiness of each and all is in the long runabsolutely certain. The vision lasted a few seconds and was gone; but the memory of it and the sense of the reality of what it taught hasremained during the quarter of a century which has since elapsed. I knew that what the vision showed was true. I had attained to a pointof view from which I saw that it must be true. That view, that conviction, I may say that consciousness, has never, even during periodsof the deepest depression, been lost.\"11Loc. cit., pp. 7, 8.

We must next pass to itsmethodical cultivation as an element of the religious life. Hindus, Buddhists, Mohammedans, and Christians all havecultivated it methodically.In India, training in mystical insight has been known from time immemorial under the name of yoga. Yoga means theexperimental union of the individual with the divine. It is based on persevering exercise; and the diet, posture,breathing, intellectual concentration, and moral discipline vary slightly in the different systems which teach it. Theyogi, or disciple, who has by these means overcome the obscurations of his lower nature sufficiently, enters into thecondition termed samâdhi, \"and comes face to face with facts which no instinct or reason can ever know.\" He learns—\"That the mind itself has a higher state of existence, beyond reason, a superconscious state, and that when the mind gets to that higherstate, then this knowledge beyond reasoning comes. All the different steps in yoga are intended to bring us scientifically to thesuperconscious state or samâdhi. Just as unconscious work is beneath consciousness, so there is another work which is aboveconsciousness, and which, also, is not accompanied with the feeling of egoism. There is no feeling of I, and yet the mind works,desireless, free from restlessness, objectless, bodiless. Then the Truth shines in its full effulgence, and we know ourselves—for Samâdhilies potential in us all—for what we truly are, free, immortal, omnipotent, loosed from the finite, and its contrasts of good and evilaltogether, and identical with the Atman or Universal Soul.\"1The Vedantists say that one may stumble into superconsciousness sporadically, without the previous discipline, but itis then impure. Their test of its purity, like our test of religion's value, is empirical: its fruits must be good for life.When a man comes out of Samâdhi, they assure us that he1My quotations are from VIVEKANANDA, Raja Yoga, London, 1896.

There seem to be four stages recognized in dhyâna. The first stage comes through concentration of themind upon one point. It excludes desire, but not discernment or judgment: it is still intellectual. In the second stage theintellectual functions drop off, and the satisfied sense of unity remains. In the third stage the satisfaction departs, andindifference begins, along with memory and self-consciousness. In the fourth stage the indifference, memory, andself-consciousness are perfected. [Just what 'memory' and 'self-consciousness' mean in this connection is doubtful.They cannot be the faculties familiar to us in the lower life.] Higher stages still of contemplation are mentioned—aregion where there exists nothing, and where the meditator says: \"There exists absolutely nothing,\" and stops. Then hereaches another region where he says: \"There are neither ideas nor absence of ideas,\" and stops again. Then anotherregion where, \"having reached the end of both idea and perception, he stops finally.\" This would seem to be, not yetNirvâna, but as close an approach to it as this life affords.2In the Mohammedan world the Sufi sect and various dervish bodies are the possessors of the mystical tradition. TheSufis have existed in Persia from the earliest times, and as their pantheism is so at variance with the hot and rigidmonotheism of the Arab mind, it has been suggested that Sufism must have been inoculated into Islam by Hinduinfluences. We Christians know little of Sufism, for its secrets are dis-1A European witness, after carefully comparing the results of Yoga with those of the hypnotic or dreamy states artificially producible byus, says: \"It makes of its true disciples good, healthy, and happy men. Through the mastery which the yogi attains over his thoughts andhis body, he grows into a 'character.' By the subjection of his impulses and propensities to his will, and the fixing of the latter upon theideal of goodness, he becomes a 'personality' hard to influence by others, and thus almost the opposite of what we usually imagine a'medium' so-called, or 'psychic subject' to be.\" KARL KELLNER: Yoga: Eine Skizze, München, 1896, p. 21.2I follow the account in C.

To give its existence a certain liveliness in your minds, I will quote a Moslemdocument, and pass away from the subject.Al-Ghazzali, a Persian philosopher and theologian, who flourished in the eleventh century, and ranks as one of thegreatest doctors of the Moslem church, has left us one of the few autobiographies to be found outside of Christianliterature. Strange that a species of book so abundant among ourselves should be so little represented elsewhere—theabsence of strictly personal confessions is the chief difficulty to the purely literary student who would like to becomeacquainted with the inwardness of religions other than the Christian.M. Schmölders has translated a part of Al-Ghazzali's autobiography into French\"1—\"The Science of the Sufis,\" says the Moslem author, \"aims at detaching the heart from all that is not God, and at giving to it for soleoccupation the meditation of the divine being. Theory being more easy for me than practice, I read [certain books] until I understood allthat can be learned by study and hearsay. Then I recognized that what pertains most exclusively to their method is just what no study cangrasp, but only transport, ecstasy, and the transformation of the soul. How great, for example, is the difference between knowing thedefinitions of health, of satiety, with their causes and conditions, and being really healthy or filled. How different to know in whatdrunkenness consists,—as being a state occasioned by a vapor that rises from the stomach,—and being drunk effectively. Without doubt,the drunken man knows neither the definition of drunkenness nor what makes it interesting for science. Being drunk, he knows nothing;whilst the physician, although not drunk, knows well in what drunkenness consists, and what are its predisposing conditions. Similarlythere is a difference between knowing the nature of abstinence, and being abstinent or having one's soul detached from the world.—ThusI had learned what words could teach of Sufism, but what was left could be learned neither.1For a full account of him, see D. B.

Considering my teaching, Ifound it was impure before God. I saw myself struggling with all my might to achieve glory and to spread my name. [Here follows anaccount of his six months' hesitation to break away from the conditions of his life at Bagdad, at the end of which he fell ill with aparalysis of the tongue.] Then, feeling my own weakness, and having entirely given up my own will, I repaired to God like a man indistress who has no more resources. He answered, as he answers the wretch who invokes him. My heart no longer felt any difficulty inrenouncing glory, wealth, and my children. So I quitted Bagdad, and reserving from my fortune only what was indispensable for mysubsistence, I distributed the rest. I went to Syria, where I remained about two years, with no other occupation than living in retreat andsolitude, conquering my desires, combating my passions, training myself to purify my soul, to make my character perfect, to prepare myheart for meditating on God—all according to the methods of the Sufis, as I had read of them.\"This retreat only increased my desire to live in solitude, and to complete the purification of my heart and fit it for meditation. But thevicissitudes of the times, the affairs of the family, the need of subsistence, changed in some respects my primitive resolve, and interferedwith my plans for a purely solitary life. I had never yet found myself completely in ecstasy, save in a few single hours; nevertheless, Ikept the hope of attaining this state. Every time that the accidents led me astray, I sought to return; and in this situation I spent ten years.During this solitary state things were revealed to me which it is impossible either to describe or to point out. I recognized for certain thatthe Sufis are assuredly walking in the path of God. Both in their acts and in their inaction, whether internal or external, they are illuminedby the light which proceeds from the prophetic source. The first condition for a Sufi is to purge his heart entirely of all that is not God.The next key of the"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP365 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 56]Page 365contemplative life consists in the humble prayers which escape from the fervent soul, and in the meditations on God in which the heart isswallowed up entirely. But in reality this is only the beginning of the Sufi life, the end of Sufism being total absorption in God. Theintuitions and all that precede are, so to speak, only the threshold for those who enter. From the beginning, revelations take place in soflagrant a shape that the Sufis see before them, whilst wide awake, the angels and the souls of the prophets. They hear their voices andobtain their favors. Then the transport rises from the perception of forms and figures to a degree which escapes all expression, and whichno man may seek to give an account of without his words involving sin.\"Whoever has had no experience of the transport knows of the true nature of prophetism nothing but the name. He may meanwhile besure of its existence, both by experience and by what he hears the Sufis say. As there are men endowed only with the sensitive facultywho reject what is offered them in the way of objects of the pure understanding, so there are intellectual men who reject and avoid thethings perceived by the prophetic faculty. A blind man can understand nothing of colors save what he has learned by narration andhearsay. Yet God has brought prophetism near to men in giving them all a state analogous to it in its principal characters. This state issleep. If you were to tell a man who was himself without experience of such a phenomenon that there are people who at times swoonaway so as to resemble dead men, and who [in dreams] yet perceive things that are hidden, he would deny it [and give his reasons].Nevertheless, his arguments would be refuted by actual experience. Wherefore, just as the understanding is a stage of human life inwhich an eye opens to discern various intellectual objects uncomprehended by sensation; just so in the prophetic the sight is illumined bya light which uncovers hidden things and objects which the intellect fails to reach. The chief properties of prophetism are perceptible onlyduring the transport, by those who embrace the Sufi life. The prophet is endowed with qualities to which you possess nothing analogous,and which consequently you cannot possibly understand. How should you know their"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP366 hl[01 03 2011 00 32 57]Page 366true nature, since one knows only what one can comprehend? But the transport which one attains by the method of the Sufis is like animmediate perception, as if one touched the objects with one's hand.\"1This incommunicableness of the transport is the keynote of all mysticism. Mystical truth exists for the individual whohas the transport, but for no one else. In this, as I have said, it resembles the knowledge given to us in sensations morethan that given by conceptual thought. Thought, with its remoteness and abstractness, has often enough in the historyof philosophy been contrasted unfavorably with sensation. It is a commonplace of metaphysics that God's knowledgecannot be discursive but must be intuitive, that is, must be constructed more after the pattern of what in ourselves iscalled immediate feeling, than after that of proposition and judgment. But our immediate feelings have no content butwhat the five senses supply; and we have seen and shall see again that mystics may emphatically deny that the sensesplay any part in the very highest type of knowledge which their transports yield.In the Christian church there have always been mystics. Although many of them have been viewed with suspicion,some have gained favor in the eyes of the authorities. The experiences of these have been treated as precedents, and acodified system of mystical theology has been based upon them, in which everything legitimate finds its place.2 Thebasis of the system is 'orison' or meditation, the methodical elevation of the soul towards God. Through the practice oforison the higher levels of mystical experience may be attained. It is odd that Protestantism, especially evangelicalProtestantism, should seemingly have abandoned everything methodical in this line. Apart from what prayer may leadto, Protestant mystical experience appears to have been almost exclusively1A.

It has been left to our mind-curers to reintroduce methodical meditation into our religious life.The first thing to be aimed at in orison is the mind's detachment from outer sensations, for these interfere with itsconcentration upon ideal things. Such manuals as Saint Ignatius's Spiritual Exercises recommend the disciple to expelsensation by a graduated series of efforts to imagine holy scenes. The acme of this kind of discipline would be a semi-hallucinatory mono-ideism—an imaginary figure of Christ, for example, coming fully to occupy the mind. Sensorialimages of this sort, whether literal or symbolic, play an enormous part in mysticism.1 But in certain cases imagerymay fall away entirely, and in the very highest raptures it tends to do so. The state of consciousness becomes theninsusceptible of any verbal description. Mystical teachers are unanimous as to this. Saint John of the Cross, forinstance, one of the best of them, thus describes the condition called the 'union of love,' which, he says, is reached by'dark contemplation.' In this the Deity compenetrates the soul, but in such a hidden way that the soul—\"finds no terms, no means, no comparison whereby to render the sublimity of the wisdom and the delicacy of the spiritual feeling withwhich she is filled. We receive this mystical knowledge of God clothed in none of the kinds of images, in none of the sensiblerepresentations, which our mind makes use of in other circumstances. Accordingly in this knowledge, since the senses and theimagination are not employed, we get neither form nor impression, nor can we give any account or furnish any likeness, although themysterious and sweet-tasting wisdom comes home so clearly to the inmost parts of our soul. Fancy a man seeing a certain kind of thingfor the first time in his life. He can understand it, use and enjoy it, but he cannot apply a name to it, nor communicate any idea of it, eventhough all the while it be a mere thing of sense.1M. RÉCÉJAC, in a recent volume, makes them essential. Mysticism he defines as \"the tendency to draw near to the Absolute morally,and by the aid of Symbols.\" See his Fondements de la Connaissance mystique, Paris, 1897, p. 66. But there are unquestionably mysticalconditions in which sensible symbols play no part."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP368 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 00]Page 368How much greater will be his powerlessness when it goes beyond the senses! This is the peculiarity of the divine language. The moreinfused, intimate, spiritual, and supersensible it is, the more does it exceed the senses, both inner and outer, and impose silence uponthem. The soul then feels as if placed in a vast and profound solitude, to which no created thing has access, in an immense andboundless desert, desert the more delicious the more solitary it is. There, in this abyss of wisdom, the soul grows by what it drinks infrom the well-springs of the comprehension of love, and recognizes, however sublime and learned may be the terms we employ, howutterly vile, insignificant, and improper they are, when we seek to discourse of divine things by their means.\"1I cannot pretend to detail to you the sundry stages of the Christian mystical life.2 Our time would not suffice, for onething; and moreover, I confess that the subdivisions and names which we find in the Catholic books seem to me torepresent nothing objectively distinct. So many men, so many minds: I imagine that these experiences can be asinfinitely varied as are the idiosyncrasies of individuals.The cognitive aspects of them, their value in the way of revelation, is what we are directly concerned with, and it iseasy to show by citation how strong an impression they leave of being revelations of new depths of truth. Saint Teresais the expert of experts in describing such conditions, so I will turn immediately to what she says of one of the highestof them, the 'orison of union.'\"In the orison of union,\" says Saint Teresa, \"the soul is1Saint John of the Cross: The Dark Night of the Soul, book ii. ch. xvii., in Vie et uvres, 3me édition, Paris, 1893, iii. 428 432. Chapterxi. of book ii. of Saint John's Ascent of Carmel is devoted to showing the harmfulness for the mystical life of the use of sensible imagery.2In particular I omit mention of visual and auditory hallucinations, verbal and graphic automatisms, and such marvels as 'levitation,'stigmatization, and the healing of disease. These phenomena, which mystics have often presented (or are believed to have presented), have noessential mystical significance, for they occur with no consciousness of illumination whatever, when they occur, as they often do, in personsof non-mystical mind. Consciousness of illumination is for us the essential mark of 'mystical' states."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP369 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 12]Page 369fully awake as regards God, but wholly asleep as regards things of this world and in respect of herself. During the short time the unionlasts, she is as it were deprived of every feeling, and even if she would, she could not think of any single thing. Thus she needs to employno artifice in order to arrest the use of her understanding: it remains so stricken with inactivity that she neither knows what she loves, norin what manner she loves, nor what she wills. In short, she is utterly dead to the things of the world and lives solely in God. I do noteven know whether in this state she has enough life left to breathe. It seems to me she has not; or at least that if she does breathe, she isunaware of it. Her intellect would fain understand something of what is going on within her, but it has so little force now that it can actin no way whatsoever. So a person who falls into a deep faint appears as if dead. \"Thus does God, when he raises a soul to union with himself, suspend the natural action of all her faculties. She neither sees, hears, norunderstands, so long as she is united with God. But this time is always short, and it seems even shorter than it is. God establishes himselfin the interior of this soul in such a way, that when she returns to herself, it is wholly impossible for her to doubt that she has been inGod, and God in her. This truth remains so strongly impressed on her that, even though many years should pass without the conditionreturning, she can neither forget the favor she received, nor doubt of its reality. If you, nevertheless, ask how it is possible that the soulcan see and understand that she has been in God, since during the union she has neither sight nor understanding, I reply that she does notsee it then, but that she sees it clearly later, after she has returned to herself, not by any vision, but by a certitude which abides with herand which God alone can give her. I knew a person who was ignorant of the truth that God's mode of being in everything must be eitherby presence, by power, or by essence, but who, after having received the grace of which I am speaking, believed this truth in the mostunshakable manner. So much so that, having consulted a half-learned man who was as ignorant on this point as she had been before shewas enlightened,"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP370 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 13]Page 370when he replied that God is in us only by 'grace,' she disbelieved his reply, so sure she was of the true answer; and when she came to askwiser doctors, they confirmed her in her belief, which much consoled her. \"But how, you will repeat, can one have such certainty in respect to what one does not see? This question, I am powerless to answer.These are secrets of God's omnipotence which it does not appertain to me to penetrate. All that I know is that I tell the truth; and I shallnever believe that any soul who does not possess this certainty has ever been really united to God.\"1The kinds of truth communicable in mystical ways, whether these be sensible or supersensible, are various. Some ofthem relate to this world,—visions of the future, the reading of hearts, the sudden understanding of texts, theknowledge of distant events, for example; but the most important revelations are theological or metaphysical.\"Saint Ignatius confessed one day to Father Laynez that a single hour of meditation at Manresa had taught him more truths aboutheavenly things than all the teachings of all the doctors put together could have taught him. One day in orison, on the steps of the choirof the Dominican church, he saw in a distinct manner the plan of divine wisdom in the creation of the world. On another occasion, duringa procession, his spirit was ravished in God, and it was given him to contemplate, in a form and images fitted to the weak understandingof a dweller on the earth, the deep mystery of the holy Trinity. This last vision flooded his heart with such sweetness, that the merememory of it in after times made him shed abundant tears.\"21The Interior Castle, Fifth Abode, ch. i., in uvres, translated by BOUIX, iii. 421 424.2BARTOLI-MICHEL: Vie de Saint Ignace de Loyola, i. 34 36. Others have had illuminations about the created world, Jacob Boehme, forinstance. At the age of twenty-five he was \"surrounded by the divine light, and replenished with the heavenly knowledge; insomuch as goingabroad into the fields to a green, at Görlitz, he there sat down, and viewing the herbs and grass of the field, in his inward light he saw intotheir essences, use, and properties,(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP371 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 15]Page 371Similarly with Saint Teresa. \"One day, being in orison,\" she writes, \"it was granted me to perceive in one instant how all things are seenand contained in God. I did not perceive them in their proper form, and nevertheless the view I had of them was of a sovereign clearness,and has remained vividly impressed upon my soul. It is one of the most signal of all the graces which the Lord has granted me. The viewwas so subtile and delicate that the understanding cannot grasp it.\"1She goes on to tell how it was as if the Deity were an enormous and sovereignly limpid diamond, in which all ouractions were contained in such a way that their full sinfulness appeared evident as never before. On another day, sherelates, while she was reciting the Athanasian Creed,—\"Our Lord made me comprehend in what way it is that(Footnote continued from previous page)which was discovered to him by their lineaments, figures, and signatures.\" Of a later period of experience he writes: \"In one quarter ofan hour I saw and knew more than if I had been many years together at an university. For I saw and knew the being of all things, theByss and the Abyss, and the eternal generation of the holy Trinity, the descent and original of the world and of all creatures through thedivine wisdom. I knew and saw in myself all the three worlds, the external and visible world being of a procreation or extern birth fromboth the internal and spiritual worlds; and I saw and knew the whole working essence, in the evil and in the good, and the mutual originaland existence; and likewise how the fruitful bearing womb of eternity brought forth. So that I did not only greatly wonder at it, but didalso exceedingly rejoice, albeit I could very hardly apprehend the same in my external man and set it down with the pen. For I had athorough view of the universe as in a chaos, wherein all things are couched and wrapt up, but it was impossible for me to explicate thesame.\" Jacob Behmen's Theosophic Philosophy, etc., by EDWARD TAYLOR, London, 1691, pp. 425, 427, abridged. So George Fox: \"I wascome up to the state of Adam in which he was before he fell. The creation was opened to me; and it was showed me, how all things hadtheir names given to them, according to their nature and virtue.

He made me see it so clearly that I remained as extremely surprised as I was comforted, and now,when I think of the holy Trinity, or hear It spoken of, I understand how the three adorable Persons form only one God and I experiencean unspeakable happiness.\"On still another occasion, it was given to Saint Teresa to see and understand in what wise the Mother of God had beenassumed into her place in Heaven.1The deliciousness of some of these states seems to be beyond anything known in ordinary consciousness. It evidentlyinvolves organic sensibilities, for it is spoken of as something too extreme to be borne, and as verging on bodily pain.2But it is too subtle and piercing a delight for ordinary words to denote. God's touches, the wounds of his spear,references to ebriety and to nuptial union have to figure in the phraseology by which it is shadowed forth. Intellectand senses both swoon away in these highest states of ecstasy. \"If our understanding comprehends,\" says Saint Teresa,\"it is in a mode which remains unknown to it, and it can understand nothing of what it comprehends. For my ownpart, I do not believe that it does comprehend, because, as I said, it does not understand itself to do so. I confess that itis all a mystery in which I am lost.\"3 In the condition called raptus or ravishment by theologians, breathing andcirculation are so depressed that it is a question among the doctors whether the soul be or be not temporarilydissevered from the body. One must read Saint Teresa's descriptions and the very exact distinctions which she makes,to persuade one's self that one is dealing, not with imaginary experiences, but with phenomena which, however rare,follow perfectly definite psychological types.1Loc. cit., p. 574.2Saint Teresa discriminates between pain in which the body has a part and pure spiritual pain (Interior Castle, 6th Abode, ch. xi.). As for thebodily part in these celestial joys, she speaks of it as \"penetrating to the marrow of the bones, whilst earthly pleasures affect only the surfaceof the senses. I think,\" she adds, \"that this is a just description, and I cannot make it better.\" Ibid., 5th Abode, ch. i.3Vie, p. 198."},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP373 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 18]Page 373To the medical mind these ecstasies signify nothing but suggested and imitated hypnoid states, on an intellectual basisof superstition, and a corporeal on of degeneration and hysteria. Undoubtedly these pathological conditions haveexisted in many and possibly in all the cases, but that fact tells us nothing about the value for knowledge of theconsciousness which they induce. To pass a spiritual judgement upon these states, we must not content ourselves withsuperficial medical talk, but inquire into their fruits for life.Their fruits appear to have been various. Stupefaction, for one thing, seems not to have been altogether absent as aresult. You may remember the helplessness in the kitchen and schoolroom of poor Margaret Mary Alacoque. Manyother ecstatics would have perished but for the care taken of them by admiring followers. The 'other-worldliness'encouraged by the mystical consciousness makes this over-abstraction from practical life peculiarly liable to befallmystics in whom the character is naturally passive and the intellect feeble; but in natively strong minds and characterswe find quite opposite results. The great Spanish mystics, who carried the habit of ecstasy as far as it has often beencarried, appear for the most part to have shown indomitable spirit and energy, and all the more so for the trances inwhich they indulged.Saint Ignatius was a mystic, but his mysticism made him assuredly one of the most powerfully practical humanengines that ever lived. Saint John of the Cross, writing of the intuitions and 'touches' by which God reaches thesubstance of the soul, tells us that—\"They enrich it marvelously. A single one of them may be sufficient to abolish at a stroke certain imperfections of which the soul duringits whole life had vainly tried to rid itself, and to leave it adorned with virtues and loaded with supernatural gifts. A single one of theseintoxicating consolations may reward it for all the labors undergone in its life—even were they numberless. Invested with an invinciblecourage, filled with an impassioned desire to suffer for its God, the soul then is seized with a strange torment—that of not being allowedto suffer enough.\"11 uvres, ii. 320."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP374 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 20]Page 374Saint Teresa is as emphatic, and much more detailed. You may perhaps remember a passage I quoted from her in myfirst lecture.1 There are many similar pages in her autobiography. Where in literature is a more evidently veraciousaccount of the formation of a new centre of spiritual energy, than is given in her description of the effects of certainecstasies which in departing leave the soul upon a higher level of emotional excitement?''Often, infirm and wrought upon with dreadful pains before the ecstasy, the soul emerges from it full of health and admirably disposedfor action as if God had willed that the body itself, already obedient to the soul's desires, should share in the soul's happiness. The soulafter such a favor is animated with a degree of courage so great that if at that moment its body should be torn to pieces for the cause ofGod, it would feel nothing but the liveliest comfort. Then it is that promises and heroic resolutions spring up in profusion in us, soaringdesires, horror of the world, and the clear perception of our proper nothingness. What empire is comparable to that of a soul who, fromthis sublime summit to which God has raised her, sees all the things of earth beneath her feet, and is captivated by no one of them? Howashamed she is of her former attachments! How amazed at her blindness! What lively pity she feels for those whom she recognizes stillshrouded in the darkness! She groans at having ever been sensitive to points of honor, at the illusion that made her ever see as honorwhat the world calls by that name. Now she sees in this name nothing more than an immense lie of which the world remains a victim.She discovers, in the new light from above, that in genuine honor there is nothing spurious, that to be faithful to this honor is to give ourrespect to what deserves to be respected really, and to consider as nothing, or as less than nothing, whatsoever perishes and is notagreeable to God. She laughs when she sees grave persons, persons of orison, caring for points of honor for which she now feelsprofoundest contempt. It is suitable to the dignity of their rank to act thus,1Above, p. 27."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP375 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 21]Page 375they pretend, and it makes them more useful to others. But she knows that in despising the dignity of their rank for the pure love of Godthey would do more good in a single day than they would effect in ten years by preserving it. She laughs at herself that there should everhave been a time in her life when she made any case of money, when she ever desired it. Oh! if human beings might only agreetogether to regard it as so much useless mud, what harmony would then reign in the world! With what friendship we would all treat eachother if our interest in honor and in money could but disappear from earth! For my own part, I feel as if it would be a remedy for all ourills.\"1Mystical conditions may, therefore, render the soul more energetic in the lines which their inspiration favors. But thiscould be reckoned an advantage only in case the inspiration were a true one. If the inspiration were erroneous, theenergy would be all the more mistaken and misbegotten. So we stand once more before that problem of truth whichconfronted us at the end of the lectures on saintliness. You will remember that we turned to mysticism precisely to getsome light on truth. Do mystical states establish the truth of those theological affections in which the saintly life hasits root?In spite of their repudiation of articulate self-description, mystical states in general assert a pretty distinct theoreticdrift. It is possible to give the outcome of the majority of them in terms that point in definite philosophical directions.One of these directions is optimism, and the other is monism. We pass into mystical states from out of ordinaryconsciousness as from a less into a more, as from a smallness into a vastness, and at the same time as from an unrestto a rest. We feel them as reconciling, unifying states. They appeal to the yes-function more than to the no-function inus. In them the unlimited absorbs the limits and peacefully closes the account. Their very denial of every adjectiveyou may propose as applicable to the ultimate truth,—He, the Self, the Atman, is to be described by 'No! no!' only,say the Upanishads,2—though it seems on the surface to be a no-function, is a denial1Vie, pp. 229, 200, 231 233, 243.2MÜLLER'S translation, part ii. p. 180."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP376 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 23]Page 376made on behalf of a deeper yes. Whoso calls the Absolute anything in particular, or says that it is this, seemsimplicitly to shut it off from being that—it is as if he lessened it. So we deny the 'this,' negating the negation which itseems to us to imply, in the interests of the higher affirmative attitude by which we are possessed. The fountain-headof Christian mysticism is Dionysius the Areopagite. He describes the absolute truth by negatives exclusively.\"The cause of all things is neither soul nor intellect; nor has it imagination, opinion, or reason, or intelligence; nor is it reason orintelligence; nor is it spoken or thought. It is neither number, nor order, nor magnitude, nor littleness, nor equality, nor inequality, norsimilarity, nor dissimilarity. It neither stands, nor moves, nor rests. It is neither essence, nor eternity, nor time. Even intellectual contactdoes not belong to it. It is neither science nor truth. It is not even royalty or wisdom; not one; not unity; not divinity or goodness; noreven spirit as we know it,\" etc., ad libitum.1But these qualifications are denied by Dionysius, not because the truth falls short of them, but because it so infinitelyexcels them. It is above them. It is super-lucent, super-splendent, super-essential, super-sublime, super everythingthat can be named. Like Hegel in his logic, mystics journey towards the positive pole of truth only by the 'Methodeder Absoluten Negativität.'2Thus come the paradoxical expressions that so abound in mystical writings. As when Eckhart tells of the still desert ofthe Godhead, \"where never was seen difference, neither Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost, where there is no one at home,yet where the spark of the soul is more at peace than in itself.\"3 As when Boehme writes of the Primal Love, that \"itmay fitly be compared to Nothing, for it is deeper than any Thing, and is as nothing with respect to alS things,forasmuch1T. DAVIDSON'S translation, in Journal of Speculative Philosophy, 1893, vol. xxii. p. 399.2\"Deus propter excellentiam non immerito Nihil vocatur.\" Scotus Erigena, quoted by ANDREW SETH: Two Lectures on Theism, New York,1897, p. 55.3J.

And because it is nothing respectively, it is therefore free from all things,and is that only good, which a man cannot express or utter what it is, there being nothing to which it may becompared, to express it by.\"1 Or as when Angelus Silesius sings:—\"Gott ist ein lauter Nichts, ihn rührt kein Nun noch Hier;Je mehr du nach ihm greiffst, je mehr entwind er dir.\"2To this dialectical use, by the intellect, of negation as a mode of passage towards a higher kind of affirmation, there iscorrelated the subtlest of moral counterparts in the sphere of the personal will. Since denial of the finite self and itswants, since asceticism of some sort, is found in religious experience to be the only doorway to the larger and moreblessed life, this moral mystery intertwines and combines with the intellectual mystery in all mystical writings.\"Love,\" continues Behmen, is Nothing, for \"when thou art gone forth wholly from the Creature and from that which is visible, and artbecome Nothing to all that is Nature and Creature, then thou art in that eternal One, which is God himself, and then thou shalt feel withinthee the highest virtue of Love. The treasure of treasures for the soul is where she goeth out of the Somewhat into that Nothing out ofwhich all things may be made. The soul here saith, I have nothing, for I am utterly stripped and naked; I can do nothing, for I have nomanner of power, but am as water poured out; I am nothing, for all that I am is no more than an image of Being, and only God is to me IAM; and so, sitting down in my own Nothingness, I give glory to the eternal Being, and will nothing of myself, that so God may will allin me, being unto me my God and all things.\"3In Paul's language, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.1Jacob Behmen's Dialogues on the Supersensual Life, translated by BERNARD HOLLAND, London, 1901, p. 48.2Cherubinischer Wandersmann, Strophe 25.3Op. cit., pp. 42, 74, abridged."},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP378 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 31]Page 378Only when I become as nothing can God enter in and no difference between his life and mine remain outstanding.1This overcoming of all the usual barriers between the individual and the Absolute is the great mystic achievement. Inmystic states we both become one with the Absolute and we become aware of our oneness. This is the everlasting andtriumphant mystical tradition, hardly altered by differences of clime or creed. In Hinduism, in Neoplatonism, inSufism, in Christian mysticism, in Whitmanism, we find the same recurring note, so that there is about mysticalutterances an eternal unanimity which ought to make a critic stop and think, and which brings it about that themystical classics have, as has been said, neither birthday nor native land. Perpetually telling of the unity of man withGod, their speech antedates languages, and they do not grow old.2'That art Thou!' say the Upanishads, and the Vedantists1From a French book I take this mystical expression of happiness in God's indwelling presence:—\"Jesus has come to take up his abode in my heart. It is not so much a habitation, an association, as a sort of fusion. Oh, new and blessed life!life which becomes each day more luminous. The wall before me, dark a few moments since, is splendid at this hour because the sun shineson it. Wherever its rays fall they light up a conflagration of glory; the smallest speck of glass sparkles, each grain of sand emits fire; even sothere is a royal song of triumph in my heart because the Lord is there. My days succeed each other; yesterday a blue sky; to-day a cloudedsun; a night filled with strange dreams; but as soon as the eyes open, and I regain consciousness and seem to begin life again, it is always thesame figure before me, always the same presence filling my heart. Formerly the day was dulled by the absence of the Lord. I used to wakeinvaded by all sorts of sad impressions, and I did not find him on my path. To-day he is with me; and the light cloudiness which covers thingsis not an obstacle to my communion with him. I feel the pressure of his hand, I feel something else which fills me with a serene joy; shall Idare to speak it out? Yes, for it is the true expression of what I experience. The Holy Spirit is not merely making me a visit; it is no meredazzling apparition which may from one moment to another spread its wings and leave me in my night, it is a permanent habitation. He candepart only if he takes me with him. More than that; he is not other than myself: he is one with me. It is not a juxtaposition, it is apenetration, a profound modification of my nature, a new manner of my being.\" Quoted from the MS.

In his divine majesty the me, the we, the thou, are not found, for in the One there can be no distinction.Every being who is annulled and entirely separated from himself, hears resound outside of him this voice and thisecho: I am God: he has an eternal way of existing, and is no longer subject to death.'\"2 In the vision of God, saysPlotinus, \"what sees is not our reason, but something prior and superior to our reason. He who thus sees does notproperly see, does not distinguish or imagine two things. He changes, he ceases to be himself, preserves nothing ofhimself. Absorbed in God, he makes but one with him, like a centre of a circle coinciding with another centre.\"3\"Here,'' writes Suso, \"the spirit dies, and yet is all alive in the marvels of the Godhead and is lost in the stillness ofthe glorious dazzling obscurity and of the naked simple unity. It is in this modeless where that the highest bliss is tobe found.\"4 \"Ich bin so gross als Gott,\" sings Angelus Silesius again, \"Er ist als ich so klein; Er kann nicht über mich,ich unter ihm nicht sein.\"5In mystical literature such self-contradictory phrases as 'dazzling obscurity,' 'whispering silence,' 'teeming desert,' arecontinually met with. They prove that not conceptual speech, but music rather, is the element through which we arebest spoken to by mystical truth. Many mystical scriptures are indeed little more than musical compositions.\"He who would hear the voice of Nada, 'the Soundless Sound,' and comprehend it, he has to learn the nature of1Upanishads, M.

Music gives us ontological messages which non-musical criticism is unable to contradict,though it may laugh at our foolishness in minding them.

It is on the whole pantheistic and optimistic, or at least the opposite ofpessimistic. It is anti-naturalistic, and harmonizes best with twice-bornness and so-called other-worldly states ofmind.My next task is to inquire whether we can invoke it as authoritative. Does it furnish any warrant for the truth of thetwice-bornness and supernaturality and pantheism which it favors? I must give my answer to this question asconcisely as I can.In brief my answer is this,—and I will divide it into three parts:—(1) Mystical states, when well developed, usually are, and have the right to be, absolutely authoritative over theindividuals to whom they come.(2) No authority emanates from them which should make it a duty for those who stand outside of them to accept theirrevelations uncritically.(3) They break down the authority of the non-mystical or rationalistic consciousness, based upon the understandingand the senses alone. They show it to be only one kind of consciousness. They open out the possibility of other ordersof truth, in which, so far as anything in us vitally responds to them, we may freely continue to have faith.I will take up these points one by one.1.As a matter of psychological fact, mystical states of a well-pronounced and emphatic sort are usually authoritativeover1Compare the extracts from Dr. Bucke, quoted on pp. 359, 360.2As serious an attempt as I know to mediate between the mystical region and the discursive life is contained in an article on Aristotle'sUnmoved Mover, by F. C. S. SCHILLER, in Mind, vol. ix., 1900."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP382 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 47]Page 382those who have them.1 They have been 'there,' and know. It is vain for rationalism to grumble about this. If themystical truth that comes to a man proves to be a force that he can live by, what mandate have we of the majority toorder him to live in another way? We can throw him into a prison or a madhouse, but we cannot change his mind—wecommonly attach it only the more stubbornly to its beliefs.2 It mocks our utmost efforts, as a matter of fact, and inpoint of logic it absolutely escapes our jurisdiction. Our own more 'rational' beliefs are based on evidence exactlysimilar in nature to that which mystics quote for theirs. Our senses, namely, have assured us of certain states of fact;but mystical experiences are as direct perceptions of fact for those who have them as any sensations ever were for us.The records show that even though the five senses be in abeyance in them, they are absolutely sensational in theirepistemological quality, if I may be pardoned the barbarous expression,—that is, they are face to face presentations ofwhat seems immediately to exist.The mystic is, in short, invulnerable, and must be left, whether we relish it or not, in undisturbed enjoyment of hiscreed. Faith, says Tolstoy, is that by which men live. And faith-state and mystic state are practically convertible terms.2.But I now proceed to add that mystics have no right to claim that we ought to accept the deliverance of their peculiarexperiences, if we are ourselves outsiders and feel no private call thereto. The utmost they can ever ask of us in thislife is to admit that they establish a presumption. They form a1I abstract from weaker states, and from those cases of which the books are full, where the director (but usually not the subject) remainsin doubt whether the experience may not have proceeded from the demon.2Example: Mr. John Nelson writes of his imprisonment for preaching Methodism: \"My soul was as a watered garden, and I could singpraises to God all day long; for he turned my captivity into joy, and gave me to rest as well on the boards, as if I had been on a bed of down.Now could I say, 'God's service is perfect freedom,' and I was carried out much in prayer that my enemies might drink of the same river ofpeace which my God gave so largely to me.\" Journal, London, no date, p. 172."},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP383 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 48]Page 383consensus and have an unequivocal outcome; and it would be odd, mystics might say, if such a unanimous type ofexperience should prove to be altogether wrong. At bottom, however, this would only be an appeal to numbers, likethe appeal of rationalism the other way; and the appeal to numbers has no logical force. If we acknowledge it, it is for'suggestive,' not for logical reasons: we follow the majority because to do so suits our life.But even this presumption from the unanimity of mystics is far from being strong. In characterizing mystic states aspantheistic, optimistic, etc., I am afraid I over-simplified the truth. I did so for expository reasons, and to keep thecloser to the classic mystical tradition. The classic religious mysticism, it now must be confessed, is only a 'privilegedcase.' It is an extract, kept true to type by the selection of the fittest specimens and their preservation in 'schools.' It iscarved out from a much larger mass; and if we take the larger mass as seriously as religious mysticism has historicallytaken itself, we find that the supposed unanimity largely disappears. To begin with, even religious mysticism itself, thekind that accumulates traditions and makes schools, is much less unanimous than I have allowed. It has been bothascetic and antinomianly self-indulgent within the Christian church.1 It is dualistic in Sankhya, and monistic inVedanta philosophy. I called it pantheistic; but the great Spanish mystics are anything but pantheists. They are withfew exceptions non-metaphysical minds, for whom 'the category of personality' is absolute. The 'union' of man withGod is for them much more like an occasional miracle than like an original identity.2 How different again, apart fromthe happiness common to all, is the mysticism of Walt Whitman, Edward Carpenter, Richard Jefferies, and othernaturalistic pantheists, from the more distinctively Christian sort.3 The fact is1RUYSBROECK, in the work which Maeterlinck has translated, has a chapter against the antinomianism of disciples. H. DELACROIX'S book(Essai sur le mysticisme spéculatif en Allemagne au XIVme Siècle, Paris, 1900) is full of antinomian material. Compare also A. JUNDT:Les Amis de Dieu au XIVme Siècle, Thèse de Strasbourg, 1879.2Compare PAUL ROUSSELOT: Les Mystiques Espagnols, Paris, 1869, ch. xii.3See CARPENTER'S Towards Democracy, especially the latter parts, and JEFFERIES'S wonderful and splendid mystic rhapsody, The Story of myHeart."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP384 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 50]Page 384that the mystical feeling of enlargement, union, and emancipation has no specific intellectual content whatever of itsown. It is capable of forming matrimonial alliances with material furnished by the most diverse philosophies andtheologies, provided only they can find a place in their framework for its peculiar emotional mood. We have no right,therefore, to invoke its prestige as distinctively in favor of any special belief, such as that in absolute idealism, or inthe absolute monistic identity, or in the absolute goodness, of the world. It is only relatively in favor of all these things—it passes out of common human consciousness in the direction in which they lie.So much for religious mysticism proper. But more remains to be told, for religious mysticism is only one half ofmysticism. The other half has no accumulated traditions except those which the text-books on insanity supply. Openany one of these, and you will find abundant cases in which 'mystical ideas' are cited as characteristic symptoms ofenfeebled or deluded states of mind. In delusional insanity, paranoia, as they sometimes call it, we may have adiabolical mysticism, a sort of religious mysticism turned upside down. The same sense of ineffable importance in thesmallest events, the same texts and words coming with new meanings, the same voices and visions and leadings andmissions, the same controlling by extraneous powers; only this time the emotion is pessimistic: instead of consolationswe have desolations; the meanings are dreadful; and the powers are enemies to life. It is evident that from the point ofview of their psychological mechanism, the classic mysticism and these lower mysticisms spring from the samemental level, from that great subliminal or transmarginal region of which science is beginning to admit the existence,but of which so little is really known. That region contains every kind of matter: 'seraph and snake' abide there side byside. To come from thence is no infallible credential. What comes must be sifted and tested, and run the gauntlet ofconfrontation with the total context of experience, just like what comes from the outer world of sense. Its value mustbe ascertained by empirical methods, so long as we are not mystics ourselves."},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP385 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 51]Page 385Once more, then, I repeat that non-mystics are under no obligation to acknowledge in mystical states a superiorauthority conferred on them by their intrinsic nature.13.Yet, I repeat once more, the existence of mystical states absolutely overthrows the pretension of non-mystical states tobe the sole and ultimate dictators of what we may believe. As a rule, mystical states merely add a supersensuousmeaning to the ordinary outward data of consciousness. They are excitements like the emotions of love or ambition,gifts to our spirit by means of which facts already objectively before us fall into a new expressiveness and make anew connection with our active life. They do not contradict these facts as such, or deny anything that our senses haveimmediately seized.2 It is the rationalistic critic rather who plays the part of denier in the controversy, and his denialshave no strength, for there never can be a state of facts to which new meaning may not truthfully be added, providedthe mind ascend to a more enveloping point of view. It must always remain an open question whether mystical statesmay not possibly be such superior points of view, windows through which the mind looks out upon a more extensiveand inclusive world. The difference of the views seen from the different mystical windows need not prevent us fromentertaining this supposition. The wider1In chapter i. of book ii. of his work Degeneration, 'MAX NORDAU' seeks to undermine all mysticism by exposing the weakness of thelower kinds. Mysticism for him means any sudden perception of hidden significance in things. He explains such perception by theabundant uncompleted associations which experiences may arouse in a degenerate brain. These give to him who has the experience avague and vast sense of its leading further, yet they awaken no definite or useful consequent in his thought. The explanation is a plausibleone for certain sorts of feeling of significance; and other alienists (WERNICKE, for example, in his Grundriss der Psychiatrie, Theil ii.,Leipzig, 1896) have explained 'paranoiac' conditions by a laming of the association-organ. But the higher mystical flights, with theirpositiveness and abruptness, are surely products of no such merely negative condition. It seems far more reasonable to ascribe them toinroads from the subconscious life, of the cerebral activity correlative to which we as yet know nothing.2They sometimes add subjective audita et visa to the facts, but as these are usually interpreted as transmundane, they oblige no alteration inthe facts of sense."},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP386 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 52]Page 386world would in that case prove to have a mixed constitution like that of this world, that is all. It would have itscelestial and its infernal regions, its tempting and its saving moments, its valid experiences and its counterfeit ones,just as our world has them; but it would be a wider world all the same. We should have to use its experiences byselecting and subordinating and substituting just as is our custom in this ordinary naturalistic world; we should beliable to error just as we are now; yet the counting in of that wider world of meanings, and the serious dealing with it,might, in spite of all the perplexity, be indispensable stages in our approach to the final fullness of the truth.In this shape, I think, we have to leave the subject. Mystical states indeed wield no authority due simply to their beingmystical states. But the higher ones among them point in directions to which the religious sentiments even ofnonmystical men incline. They tell of the supremacy of the ideal, of vastness, of union, of safety, and of rest. Theyoffer us hypotheses, hypotheses which we may voluntarily ignore, but which as thinkers we cannot possibly upset.The supernaturalism and optimism to which they would persuade us may, interpreted in one way or another, be afterall the truest of insights into the meaning of this life.\"Oh, the little more, and how much it is; and the little less, and what worlds away!\" It may be that possibility andpermission of this sort are all that the religious consciousness requires to live on. In my last lecture I shall have to tryto persuade you that this is the case. Meanwhile, however, I am sure that for many of my readers this diet is tooslender. If supernaturalism and inner union with the divine are true, you think, then not so much permission, ascompulsion to believe, ought to be found. Philosophy has always professed to prove religious truth by coerciveargument; and the construction of philosophies of this kind has always been one favorite function of the religious life,if we use this term in the large historic sense. But religious philosophy is an enormous subject, and in my next lectureI can only give that brief glance at it which my limits will allow."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP387 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 53]Page 387Lecture XVIIIPhilosophyThe subject of Saintliness left us face to face with the question, Is the sense of divine presence a sense of anythingobjectively true? We turned first to mysticism for an answer, and found that although mysticism is entirely willing tocorroborate religion, it is too private (and also too various) in its utterances to be able to claim a universal authority.But philosophy publishes results which claim to be universally valid if they are valid at all, so we now turn with ourquestion to philosophy. Can philosophy stamp a warrant of veracity upon the religious man's sense of the divine?I imagine that many of you at this point begin to indulge in guesses at the goal to which I am tending. I haveundermined the authority of mysticism, you say, and the next thing I shall probably do is to seek to discredit that ofphilosophy. Religion, you expect to hear me conclude, is nothing but an affair of faith, based either on vaguesentiment, or on that vivid sense of the reality of things unseen of which in my second lecture and in the lecture onMysticism I gave so many examples. It is essentially private and individualistic; it always exceeds our powers offormulation; and although attempts to pour its contents into a philosophic mould will probably always go on, menbeing what they are, yet these attempts are always secondary processes which in no way add to the authority, orwarrant the veracity, of the sentiments from which they derive their own stimulus and borrow whatever glow ofconviction they may themselves possess. In short, you suspect that I am planning to defend feeling at the expense ofreason, to rehabilitate the primitive and unreflective, and to dissuade you from the hope of any Theology worthy ofthe name.To a certain extent I have to admit that you guess rightly. I do believe that feeling is the deeper source of religion, andthat philosophic and theological formulas are secondary products, like translations of a text into another tongue. Butall such statements are misleading from their brevity, and it will take the whole hour for me to explain to you exactlywhat I mean."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP388 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 55]Page 388When I call theological formulas secondary products, I mean that in a world in which no religious feeling had everexisted, I doubt whether any philosophic theology could ever have been framed. I doubt if dispassionate intellectualcontemplation of the universe, apart from inner unhappiness and need of deliverance on the one hand and mysticalemotion on the other, would ever have resulted in religious philosophies such as we now possess. Men would havebegun with animistic explanations of natural fact, and criticised these away into scientific ones, as they actually havedone. In the science they would have left a certain amount of 'psychical research,' even as they now will probablyhave to re-admit a certain amount. But high-flying speculations like those of either dogmatic or idealistic theology,these they would have had no motive to venture on, feeling no need of commerce with such deities. Thesespeculations must, it seems to me, be classed as over-beliefs, buildings-out performed by the intellect into directionsof which feeling originally supplied the hint.But even if religious philosophy had to have its first hint supplied by feeling, may it not have dealt in a superior waywith the matter which feeling suggested? Feeling is private and dumb, and unable to give an account of itself. Itallows that its results are mysteries and enigmas, declines to justify them rationally, and on occasion is willing thatthey should even pass for paradoxical and absurd. Philosophy takes just the opposite attitude. Her aspiration is toreclaim from mystery and paradox whatever territory she touches. To find an escape from obscure and waywardpersonal persuasion to truth objectively valid for all thinking men has ever been the intellect's most cherished ideal.To redeem religion from unwholesome privacy, and to give public status and universal right of way to itsdeliverances, has been reason's task.I believe that philosophy will always have opportunity to labor at this task.1 We are thinking beings, and we cannotexclude the intellect from participating in any of our functions. Even in soliloquizing with ourselves, we construe ourfeelings intellectually. Both our personal ideals and our religious and mystical experiences must be interpreted con-1Compare Professor W. WALLACE'S Gifford Lectures, in Lectures and Essays, Oxford, 1898, pp. 17 ff."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP389 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 57]Page 389gruously with the kind of scenery which our thinking mind inhabits. The philosophic climate of our time inevitablyforces its own clothing on us. Moreover, we must exchange our feelings with one another, and in doing so we have tospeak, and to use general and abstract verbal formulas. Conceptions and constructions are thus a necessary part of ourreligion; and as moderator amid the clash of hypotheses, and mediator among the criticisms of one man'sconstructions by another, philosophy will always have much to do. It would be strange if I disputed this, when thesevery lectures which I am giving are (as you will see more clearly from now onwards) a laborious attempt to extractfrom the privacies of religious experience some general facts which can be defined in formulas upon which everybodymay agree.Religious experience, in other words, spontaneously and inevitably engenders myths, superstitions, dogmas, creeds,and metaphysical theologies, and criticisms of one set of these by the adherents of another. Of late, impartialclassifications and comparisons have become possible, alongside of the denunciations and anathemas by which thecommerce between creeds used exclusively to be carried on. We have the beginnings of a 'Science of Religions,' so-called; and if these lectures could ever be accounted a crumb-like contribution to such a science, I should be madevery happy.But all these intellectual operations, whether they be constructive or comparative and critical, presuppose immediateexperiences as their subject-matter. They are interpretative and inductive operations, operations after the fact,consequent upon religious feeling, not coördinate with it, not independent of what it ascertains.The intellectualism in religion which I wish to discredit pretends to be something altogether different from this. Itassumes to construct religious objects out of the resources of logical reason alone, or of logical reason drawingrigorous inference from non-subjective facts. It calls its conclusions dogmatic theology, or philosophy of the absolute,as the case may be; it does not call them science of religions. It reaches them in an a priori way, and warrants theirveracity.Warranted systems have ever been the idols of aspiring"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP390 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 58]Page 390souls. All-inclusive, yet simple; noble, clean, luminous, stable, rigorous, true;—what more ideal refuge could there bethan such a system would offer to spirits vexed by the muddiness and accidentality of the world of sensible things?Accordingly, we find inculcated in the theological schools of to-day, almost as much as in those of the fore-time, adisdain for merely possible or probable truth, and of results that only private assurance can grasp. Scholastics andidealists both express this disdain. Principal John Caird, for example, writes as follows in his Introduction to thePhilosophy of Religion:—''Religion must indeed be a thing of the heart; but in order to elevate it from the region of subjective caprice and waywardness, and todistinguish between that which is true and false in religion, we must appeal to an objective standard. That which enters the heart mustfirst be discerned by the intelligence to be true. It must be seen as having in its own nature a right to dominate feeling, and asconstituting the principle by which feeling must be judged.1 In estimating the religious character of individuals, nations, or races, the firstquestion is, not how they feel, but what they think and believe—not whether their religion is one which manifests itself in emotions, moreor less vehement and enthusiastic, but what are the conceptions of God and divine things by which these emotions are called forth.Feeling is necessary in religion, but it is by the content or intelligent basis of a religion, and not by feeling, that its character and worth areto be determined.\"2Cardinal Newman, in his work, The Idea of a University, gives more emphatic expression still to this disdain forsentiment.3 Theology, he says, is a science in the strictest sense of the word. I will tell you, he says, what it is not—not 'physical evidences' for God, not 'natural religion,' for these are but vague subjective interpretations:—\"If,\" he continues, \"the Supreme Being is powerful or skillful, just so far as the telescope shows power, or the1Op. cit., p. 174, abridged.2Ibid., p. 186, abridged and italicized.3Discourse II. § 7."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP391 hl[01 03 2011 00 33 59]Page 391microscope shows skill, if his moral law is to be ascertained simply by the physical processes of the animal frame, or his will gatheredfrom the immediate issues of human affairs, if his Essence is just as high and deep and broad as the universe and no more; if this be thefact, then will I confess that there is no specific science about God, that theology is but a name, and a protest in its behalf an hypocrisy.Then, pious as it is to think of Him, while the pageant of experiment or abstract reasoning passes by, still such piety is nothing more thana poetry of thought, or an ornament of language, a certain view taken of Nature which one man has and another has not, which giftedminds strike out, which others see to be admirable and ingenious, and which all would be the better for adopting. It is but the theology ofNature, just as we talk of the philosophy or the romance of history, or the poetry of childhood, or the picturesque or the sentimental or thehumorous, or any other abstract quality which the genius or the caprice of the individual, or the fashion of the day, or the consent of theworld, recognizes in any set of objects which are subjected to its contemplation. I do not see much difference between avowing that thereis no God, and implying that nothing definite can be known for certain about Him.\"What I mean by Theology, continues Newman, is none of these things: \"I simply mean the Science of God, or the truths we know aboutGod, put into a system, just as we have a science of the stars and call it astronomy, or of the crust of the earth and call it geology.\"In both these extracts we have the issue clearly set before us: Feeling valid only for the individual is pitted againstreason valid universally. The test is a perfectly plain one of fact. Theology based on pure reason must in point of factconvince men universally. If it did not, wherein would its superiority consist? If it only formed sects and schools,even as sentiment and mysticism form them, how would it fulfill its programme of freeing us from personal capriceand waywardness? This perfectly definite practical test of the pretensions of philosophy to found religion on universalreason simplifies my procedure to-day.

It will suffice if I show that as a matter of history it fails to prove its pretension to be'objectively' convincing. In fact, philosophy does so fail. It does not banish differences; it founds schools and sectsjust as feeling does. The logical reason of man operates, in short, in this field of divinity exactly as it has alwaysoperated in love, or in patriotism, or in politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our passions orour mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand. It finds arguments for our conviction, for indeed it has to find them.It amplifies and defines our faith, and dignifies it and lends it words and plausibility. It hardly ever engenders it; itcannot now secure it.1Lend me your attention while I run through some of the points of the older systematic theology. You find them in bothProtestant and Catholic manuals, best of all in the innumerable text-books published since Pope Leo's Encyclicalrecommending the study of Saint Thomas. I glance first at the arguments by which dogmatic theology establishesGod's existence, after that at those by which it establishes his nature.2The arguments for God's existence have stood for hundreds of years with the waves of unbelieving criticism breakingagainst them, never totally discrediting them in the ears of the faithful, but on the whole slowly and surely washingout the mortar from between their joints. If you have a God already whom you believe in, these arguments confirmyou. If you1As regards the secondary character of intellectual constructions, and the primacy of feeling and instinct in founding religious beliefs, seethe striking work of H. FIELDING, The Hearts of Men, London, 1902, which came into my hands after my text was written. \"Creeds,\"says the author, \"are the grammar of religion, they are to religion what grammar is to speech. Words are the expression of our wants;grammar is the theory formed afterwards. Speech never proceeded from grammar, but the reverse. As speech progresses and changesfrom unknown causes, grammar must follow\" (p. 313). The whole book, which keeps unusually close to concrete facts, is little morethan an amplification of this text.2For convenience' sake, I follow the order of A.

The proofs are various. The 'cosmological' one, so-called, reasons from thecontingence of the world to a First Cause which must contain whatever perfections the world itself contains. The'argument from design' reasons, from the fact that Nature's laws are mathematical, and her parts benevolently adaptedto each other, that this cause is both intellectual and benevolent. The 'moral argument' is that the moral lawpresupposes a lawgiver. The 'argument ex consensu gentium' is that the belief in God is so widespread as to begrounded in the rational nature of man, and should therefore carry authority with it.As I just said, I will not discuss these arguments technically. The bare fact that all idealists since Kant have feltentitled either to scout or to neglect them shows that they are not solid enough to serve as religion's all-sufficientfoundation. Absolutely impersonal reasons would be in duty bound to show more general convincingness. Causation isindeed too obscure a principle to bear the weight of the whole structure of theology. As for the argument from design,see how Darwinian ideas have revolutionized it. Conceived as we now conceive them, as so many fortunate escapesfrom almost limitless processes of destruction, the benevolent adaptations which we find in Nature suggest a deityvery different from the one who figured in the earlier versions of the argument.1 The fact is that these arguments dobut follow the combined1It must not be forgotten that any form of disorder in the world might, by the design argument, suggest a God for just that kind ofdisorder. The truth is that any state of things whatever that can be named is logically susceptible of teleological interpretation. The ruinsof the earthquake at Lisbon, for example: the whole of past history had to be planned exactly as it was to bring about in the fullness oftime just that particular arrangement of débris of masonry, furniture, and once living bodies. No other train of causes would have beensufficient. And so of any other arrangement, bad or good, which might as a matter of fact be found resulting anywhere from previousconditions. To avoid such pessimistic consequences and save its beneficent designer, the design argument accordingly invokes two otherprinciples, restrictive in their operation. The first is physical: Nature's forces tend of their own accord only to disorder and destruction, toheaps of ruins, not to architecture. This principle, though plausible at first sight, seems, in the light of recent biology, to be more andmore improbable. The second principle is one of anthropomorphic interpretation. No arrangement that for us is(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP394 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 09]Page 394suggestions of the facts and of our feeling. They prove nothing rigorously. They only corroborate our preëxistentpartialities.If philosophy can do so little to establish God's existence, how stands it with her efforts to define his attributes? It isworth while to look at the attempts of systematic theology in this direction.Since God is First Cause, this science of sciences says, he differs from all his creatures in possessing existence a se. From this 'a-se-ity'on God's part, theology deduces by(Footnote continued from previous page)'disorderly' can possibly have been an object of design at all. This principle is of course a mere assumption in the interests ofanthropomorphic Theism.When one views the world with no definite theological bias one way or the other, one sees that order and disorder, as we now recognize them,are purely human inventions. We are interested in certain types of arrangement, useful, æsthetic, or moral,—so interested that whenever wefind them realized, the fact emphatically rivets our attention. The result is that we work over the contents of the world selectively. It isoverflowing with disorderly arrangements from our point of view, but order is the only thing we care for and look at, and by choosing, onecan always find some sort of orderly arrangement in the midst of any chaos. If I should throw down a thousand beans at random upon a table,I could doubtless, by eliminating a sufficient number of them, leave the rest in almost any geometrical pattern you might propose to me, andyou might then say that that pattern was the thing prefigured beforehand, and that the other beans were mere irrelevance and packingmaterial. Our dealings with Nature are just like this. She is a vast plenum in which our attention draws capricious lines in innumerabledirections. We count and name whatever lies upon the special lines we trace, whilst the other things and the untraced lines are neither namednor counted. There are in reality infinitely more things 'unadapted' to each other in this world than there are things 'adapted'; infinitely morethings with irregular relations than with regular relations between them. But we look for the regular kind of thing exclusively, andingeniously discover and preserve it in our memory. It accumulates with other regular kinds, until the collection of them fills ourencyclopædias. Yet all the while between and around them lies an infinite anonymous chaos of objects that no one ever thought of together, ofrelations that never yet attracted our attention.The facts of order from which the physico-theological argument starts are thus easily susceptible of interpretation as arbitrary humanproducts. So long as this is the case, although of course no argument against God follows, it follows that the argument for him will fail toconstitute a knockdown proof of his existence. It will be convincing only to those who on other grounds believe in him already."},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP395 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 11]Page 395mere logic most of his other perfections. For instance, he must be both necessary and absolute, cannot not be, and cannot in any way bedetermined by anything else. This makes Him absolutely unlimited from without, and unlimited also from within; for limitation is non-being; and God is being itself. This unlimitedness makes God infinitely perfect. Moreover, God is One, and Only, for the infinitelyperfect can admit no peer. He is Spiritual, for were He composed of physical parts, some other power would have to combine them intothe total, and his aseity would thus be contradicted. He is therefore both simple and non-physical in nature. He is simple metaphysicallyalso, that is to say, his nature and his existence cannot be distinct, as they are in finite substances which share their formal natures withone another, and are individual only in their material aspect. Since God is one and only, his essentia and his esse must be given at onestroke. This excludes from his being all those distinctions, so familiar in the world of finite things, between potentiality and actuality,substance and accidents, being and activity, existence and attributes. We can talk, it is true, of God's powers, acts, and attributes, butthese discriminations are only 'virtual,' and made from the human point of view. In God all these points of view fall into an absoluteidentity of being.This absence of all potentiality in God obliges Him to be immutable. He is actuality, through and through. Were there anything potentialabout Him, He would either lose or gain by its actualization, and either lose or gain would contradict his perfection. He cannot, therefore,change. Furthermore, He is immense, boundless; for could He be outlined in space, He would be composite, and this would contradicthis indivisibility. He is therefore omnipresent, indivisibly there, at every point of space. He is similarly wholly present at every point oftime,—in other words eternal. For if He began in time, He would need a prior cause, and that would contradict his aseity. If He ended, itwould contradict his necessity. If He went through any succession, it would contradict his immutability.He has intelligence and will and every other creature-perfection, for we have them, and effectus nequit superare"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP396 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 22]Page 396causam. In Him, however, they are absolutely and eternally in act, and their object, since God can be bounded by naught that is external,can primarily be nothing else than God himself. He knows himself, then, in one eternal indivisible act, and wills himself with an infiniteself-pleasure.1 Since He must of logical necessity thus love and will himself, He cannot be called 'free' ad intra, with the freedom ofcontrarieties that characterizes finite creatures. Ad extra, however, or with respect to his creation, God is free. He cannot need to create,being perfect in being and in happiness already. He wills to create, then, by an absolute freedom.Being thus a substance endowed with intellect and will and freedom, God is a person; and a living person also, for He is both object andsubject of his own activity, and to be this distinguishes the living from the lifeless. He is thus absolutely self-sufficient: his self-knowledge and self-love are both of them infinite and adequate, and need no extraneous conditions to perfect them.He is omniscient, for in knowing himself as Cause He knows all creature things and events by implication. His knowledge is previsive,for He is present to all time. Even our free acts are known beforehand to Him, for otherwise his wisdom would admit of successivemoments of enrichment, and this would contradict his immutability. He is omnipotent for everything that does not involve logicalcontradiction. He can make being—in other words his power includes creation. If what He creates were made of his own substance, itwould have to be infinite in essence, as that substance, is; but it is finite; so it must be non-divine in substance. If it were made of asubstance, an eternally existing matter, for example, which God found there to his hand, and to which He simply gave its form, thatwould contradict God's definition as First Cause, and make Him a mere mover of something caused already. The things he creates, then,He creates ex nihilo, and gives them absolute being as so many finite substances additional to himself. The forms which he imprints uponthem have their prototypes in his ideas. But as in God there is no such thing as1For the scholastics the facultas appetendi embraces feeling, desire, and will."},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP397 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 24]Page 397multiplicity, and as these ideas for us are manifold, we must distinguish the ideas as they are in God and the way in which our mindsexternally imitate them. We must attribute them to Him only in a terminative sense, as differing aspects, from the finite point of view, ofhis unique essence.God of course is holy, good, and just. He can do no evil, for He is positive being's fullness, and evil is negation. It is true that He hascreated physical evil in places, but only as a means of wider good, for bonum totius pr eminet bonum partis. Moral evil He cannot will,either as end or means, for that would contradict his holiness. By creating free beings He permits it only, neither his justice nor hisgoodness obliging Him to prevent the recipients of freedom from misusing the gift.As regards God's purpose in creating, primarily it can only have been to exercise his absolute freedom by the manifestation to others ofhis glory. From this it follows that the others must be rational beings, capable in the first place of knowledge, love, and honor, and in thesecond place of happiness, for the knowledge and love of God is the mainspring of felicity. In so far forth one may say that God'ssecondary purpose in creating is love.I will not weary you by pursuing these metaphysical determinations farther, into the mysteries of God's Trinity, forexample. What I have given will serve as a specimen of the orthodox philosophical theology of both Catholics andProtestants. Newman, filled with enthusiasm at God's list of perfections, continues the passage which I began to quoteto you by a couple of pages of a rhetoric so magnificent that I can hardly refrain from adding them, in spite of theinroad they would make upon our time.1 He first enumerates God's attributes sonorously, then celebrates his ownershipof everything in earth and Heaven, and the dependence of all that happens upon his permissive will. He gives usscholastic philosophy 'touched with emotion,' and every philosophy should be touched with emotion to be rightlyunderstood. Emotionally, then, dogmatic theology is worth something to minds of the1Op. cit., Discourse III. § 7."},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP398 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 25]Page 398type of Newman's. It will aid us to estimate what it is worth intellectually, if at this point I make a short digression.What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. The Continental schools of philosophy have too oftenoverlooked the fact that man's thinking is organically connected with his conduct. It seems to me to be the chief gloryof English and Scottish thinkers to have kept the organic connection in view. The guiding principle of Britishphilosophy has in fact been that every difference must make a difference, every theoretical difference somewhere issuein a practical difference, and that the best method of discussing points of theory is to begin by ascertaining whatpractical difference would result from one alternative or the other being true. What is the particular truth in questionknown as? In what facts does it result? What is its cash-value in terms of particular experience? This is thecharacteristic English way of taking up a question. In this way, you remember, Locke takes up the question ofpersonal identity. What you mean by it is just your chain of particular memories, says he. That is the only concretelyverifiable part of its significance. All further ideas about it, such as the oneness or manyness of the spiritual substanceon which it is based, are therefore void of intelligible meaning; and propositions touching such ideas may beindifferently affirmed or denied. So Berkeley with his 'matter' The cash-value of matter is our physical sensations.That is what it is known as, all that we concretely verify of its conception. That, therefore, is the whole meaning ofthe term 'matter'— any other pretended meaning is mere wind of words. Hume does the same thing with causation. Itis known as habitual antecedence, and as tendency on our part to look for something definite to come. Apart from thispractical meaning it has no significance whatever, and books about it may be committed to the flames, says Hume.Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, James Mill, John Mill, and Professor Bain, have followed more or lessconsistently the same method; and Shadworth Hodgson has used the principle with full explicitness. When all is saidand done, it was English and Scotch writers, and not Kant, who introduced 'the critical method' into philosophy, theone method fitted to make philosophy a"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP399 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 26]Page 399study worthy of serious men. For what seriousness can possibly remain in debating philosophic propositions that willnever make an appreciable difference to us in action? And what could it matter, if all propositions were practicallyindifferent, which of them we should agree to call true or which false?An American philosopher of eminent originality, Mr. Charles Sanders Peirce, has rendered thought a service bydisentangling from the particulars of its application the principle by which these men were instinctively guided, andby singling it out as fundamental and giving to it a Greek name. He calls it the principle of pragmatism, and hedefends it somewhat as follows:1—Thought in movement has for its only conceivable motive the attainment of belief, or thought at rest. Only when ourthought about a subject has found its rest in belief can our action on the subject firmly and safely begin. Beliefs, inshort, are rules for action; and the whole function of thinking is but one step in the production of active habits. If therewere any part of a thought that made no difference in the thought's practical consequences, then that part would be noproper element of the thought's significance. To develop a thought's meaning we need therefore only determine whatconduct it is fitted to produce; that conduct is for us its sole significance; and the tangible fact at the root of all ourthought-distinctions is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference ofpractice. To attain perfect clearness in our thoughts of an object, we need then only consider what sensations,immediate or remote, we are conceivably to expect from it, and what conduct we must prepare in case the objectshould be true. Our conception of these practical consequences is for us the whole of our conception of the object, sofar as that conception has positive significance at all.This is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. Such a principle will help us on this occasion to decide,among the various attributes set down in the scholastic inven-1In an article, How to make our Ideas Clear, in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1878, vol. xii. p. 286."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP400 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 28]Page 400tory of God's perfections, whether some be not far less significant than others.If, namely, we apply the principle of pragmatism to God's metaphysical attributes, strictly so called, as distinguishedfrom his moral attributes, I think that, even were we forced by a coercive logic to believe them, we still should have toconfess them to be destitute of all intelligible significance. Take God's aseity, for example; or his necessariness; hisimmateriality; his 'simplicity' or superiority to the kind of inner variety and succession which we find in finite beings,his indivisibility, and lack of the inner distinctions of being and activity, substance and accident, potentiality andactuality, and the rest; his repudiation of inclusion in a genus; his actualized infinity; his 'personality,' apart from themoral qualities which it may comport; his relations to evil being permissive and not positive; his self-sufficiency,self-love, and absolute felicity in himself:—candidly speaking, how do such qualities as these make any definiteconnection with our life? And if they severally call for no distinctive adaptations of our conduct, what vital differencecan it possibly make to a man's religion whether they be true or false?For my own part, although I dislike to say aught that may grate upon tender associations, I must frankly confess thateven though these attributes were faultlessly deduced, I cannot conceive of its being of the smallest consequence to usreligiously that any one of them should be true. Pray, what specific act can I perform in order to adapt myself thebetter to God's simplicity? Or how does it assist me to plan my behavior, to know that his happiness is anyhowabsolutely complete? In the middle of the century just past, Mayne Reid was the great writer of books of out-of-dooradventure. He was forever extolling the hunters and field-observers of living animals' habits, and keeping up a fire ofinvective against the 'closet-naturalists,' as he called them, the collectors and classifiers, and handlers of skeletons andskins. When I was a boy, I used to think that a closet-naturalist must be the vilest type of wretch under the sun. Butsurely the systematic theologians are the closet-naturalists of the deity, even in Captain Mayne Reid's sense.

They have the trail of the serpent over them. One feels that in the theologians' hands, they areonly a set of titles obtained by a mechanical manipulation of synonyms; verbality has stepped into the place of vision,professionalism into that of life. Instead of bread we have a stone; instead of a fish, a serpent. Did such aconglomeration of abstract terms give really the gist of our knowledge of the deity, schools of theology might indeedcontinue to flourish, but religion, vital religion, would have taken its flight from this world. What keeps religion goingis something else than abstract definitions and systems of concatenated adjectives, and something different fromfaculties of theology and their professors. All these things are after-effects, secondary accretions upon thosephenomena of vital conversation with the unseen divine, of which I have shown you so many instances, renewingthemselves in sqcula sqculorum in the lives of humble private men.So much for the metaphysical attributes of God! From the point of view of practical religion, the metaphysicalmonster which they offer to our worship is an absolutely worthless invention of the scholarly mind.What shall we now say of the attributes called moral? Pragmatically, they stand on an entirely different footing. Theypositively determine fear and hope and expectation, and are foundations for the saintly life. It needs but a glance atthem to show how great is their significance.God's holiness, for example: being holy, God can will nothing but the good. Being omnipotent, he can secure itstriumph. Being omniscient, he can see us in the dark. Being just, he can punish us for what he sees. Being loving, hecan pardon too. Being unalterable, we can count on him securely. These qualities enter into connection with out life, itis highly important that we should be informed concerning them. That God's purpose in creation should be themanifestation of his glory is also an attribute which has definite relations to our"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP402 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 30]Page 402practical life. Among other things it has given a definite character to worship in all Christian countries. If dogmatictheology really does prove beyond dispute that a God with characters like these exists, she may well claim to give asolid basis to religious sentiment. But verily, how stands it with her arguments?It stands with them as ill as with the arguments for his existence. Not only do post-Kantian idealists reject them rootand branch, but it is a plain historic fact that they never have converted any one who has found in the moralcomplexion of the world, as he experienced it, reasons for doubting that a good God can have framed it. To proveGod's goodness by the scholastic argument that there is no non-being in his essence would sound to such a witnesssimply silly.No! the book of Job went over this whole matter once for all and definitively. Ratiocination is a relatively superficialand unreal path to the deity: ''I will lay mine hand upon my mouth; I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear, butnow mine eye seeth Thee.\" An intellect perplexed and baffled, yet a trustful sense of presence—such is the situationof the man who is sincere with himself and with the facts, but who remains religious still.1We must therefore, I think, bid a definitive good-by to dogmatic theology. In all sincerity our faith must do withoutthat warrant. Modern idealism, I repeat, has said good-by to this theology forever. Can modern idealism give faith abetter warrant, or must she still rely on her poor self for witness?The basis of modern idealism is Kant's doctrine of the Transcendental Ego of Apperception. By this formidable termKant merely meant the fact that the consciousness 'I think1Pragmatically, the most important attribute of God is his punitive justice. But who, in the present state of theological opinion on thatpoint, will dare maintain that hell fire or its equivalent in some shape is rendered certain by pure logic? Theology herself has largelybased this doctrine upon revelation; and, in discussing it, has tended more and more to substitute conventional ideas of criminal law for apriori principles of reason. But the very notion that this glorious universe, with planets and winds, and laughing sky and ocean, shouldhave been conceived and had its beams and rafters laid in technicalities of criminality, is incredible to our modern imagination. Itweakens a religion to hear it argued upon such a basis."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP403 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 32]Page 403them' must (potentially or actually) accompany all our objects. Former skeptics had said as much, but the 'I' inquestion had remained for them identified with the personal individual. Kant abstracted and depersonalized it, andmade it the most universal of all his categories, although for Kant himself the Transcendental Ego had no theologicalimplications.It was reserved for his successors to convert Kant's notion of Bewusstsein überhaupt, or abstract consciousness, intoan infinite concrete self-consciousness which is the soul of the world, and in which our sundry personal self-consciousness have their being. It would lead me into technicalities to show you even briefly how this transformationwas in point of fact effected. Suffice it to say that in the Hegelian school, which to-day so deeply influences bothBritish and American thinking, two principles have borne the brunt of the operation.The first of these principles is that the old logic of identity never gives us more than a post-mortem dissection ofdisjecta membra, and that the fullness of life can be construed to thought only by recognizing that every object whichour thought may propose to itself involves the notion of some other object which seems at first to negate the first one.The second principle is that to be conscious of a negation is already virtually to be beyond it. The mere asking of aquestion or expression of a dissatisfaction proves that the answer or the satisfaction is already imminent; the finite,realized as such, is already the infinite in posse.Applying these principles, we seem to get a propulsive force into our logic which the ordinary logic of a bare, starkself-identity in each thing never attains to. The objects of our thought now act within our thought, act as objects actwhen given in experience. They change and develop. They introduce something other than themselves along withthem; and this other, at first only ideal or potential, presently proves itself also to be actual. It supersedes the thing atfirst supposed, and both verifies and corrects it, in developing the fullness of its meaning.The program is excellent; the universe is a place where things are followed by other things that both correct and fulfillthem; and a logic which gave us something like this movement of fact would express truth far better than the"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP404 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 33]Page 404traditional school-logic, which never gets of its own accord from anything to anything else, and registers onlypredictions and subsections, or static resemblances and differences. Nothing could be more unlike the methods ofdogmatic theology than those of this new logic. Let me quote in illustration some passages from the Scottishtranscendentalist whom I have already named.\"How are we to conceive,\" Principal Caird writes, \"of the reality in which all intelligence rests?\" He replies: \"Two things may withoutdifficulty be proved, viz., that this reality is an absolute Spirit, and conversely that it is only in communion with this absolute Spirit orIntelligence that the finite Spirit can realize itself. It is absolute; for the faintest movement of human intelligence would be arrested, if itdid not presuppose the absolute reality of intelligence, of thought itself. Doubt or denial themselves presuppose and indirectly affirm it.When I pronounce anything to be true, I pronounce it, indeed, to be relative to thought, but not to be relative to my thought, or to thethought of any other individual mind. From the existence of all individual minds as such I can abstract; I can think them away. But thatwhich I cannot think away is thought or self-consciousness itself, in its independence and absoluteness, or, in other words, an AbsoluteThought or Self-Consciousness.\"Here, you see, Principal Carid makes the transition which Kant did not make: he converts the omnipresence ofconsciousness in general as a condition of 'truth' being anywhere possible, into an omnipresent universalconsciousness, which he identifies with God in his concreteness. He next proceeds to use the principle that toacknowledge your limits is in essence to be beyond them; and makes the transition to the religious experience ofindividuals in the following words:—\"If [Man] were only a creature of transient sensations and impulses, of an ever coming and going succession of intuitions, fancies,feelings, then nothing could ever have for him the character of objective truth or reality. But it is the prerogative of man's spiritual naturethat he can yield"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP405 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 34]Page 405himself up to a thought and will that are infinitely larger than his own. As a thinking, self-conscious being, indeed, he may be said, byhis very nature, to live in the atmosphere of the Universal Life. As a thinking being, it is possible for me to suppress and quell in myconsciousness every movement of self-assertion, every notion and opinion that is merely mine, every desire that belongs to me as thisparticular Self, and to become the pure medium of a thought that is universal—in one word, to live no more my own life, but let myconsciousness be possessed and suffused by the Infinite and Eternal life of spirit. And yet it is just in this renunciation of self that I trulygain myself, or realize the highest possibilities of my own nature. For whilst in one sense we give up self to live the universal andabsolute life of reason, yet that to which we thus surrender ourselves is in reality our truer self. The life of absolute reason is not a lifethat is foreign to us.\"Nevertheless, Principal Caird goes on to say, so far as we are able outwardly to realize this doctrine, the balm it offersremains incomplete. Whatever we may be in posse, the very best of us in actu falls very short of being absolutelydivine. Social morality, love, and self-sacrifice even, merge our Self only in some other finite self or selves. They donot quite identify it with the Infinite. Man's ideal destiny, infinite in abstract logic, might thus seem in practice foreverunrealizable.\"Is there, then,\" our author continues, \"no solution of the contradiction between the ideal and the actual? We answer, There is such asolution, but in order to reach it we are carried beyond the sphere of morality into that of religion. It may be said to be the essentialcharacteristic of religion as contrasted with morality, that it changes aspiration into fruition, anticipation into realization; that instead ofleaving man in the interminable pursuit of a vanishing ideal, it makes him the actual partaker of a divine or infinite life. Whether weview religion from the human side or the divine—as the surrender of the soul to God, or as the life of God in the soul—in either aspect itis of its very essence that the Infinite has ceased to be a far-off vision, and has become a present reality. The very first pulsation of the"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP406 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 40]Page 406spiritual life, when we rightly apprehend its significance, is the indication that the division between the Spirit and its object has vanished,that the ideal has become real, that the finite has reached its goal and become suffused with the presence and life of the Infinite.\"Oneness of mind and will with the divine mind and will is not the future hope and aim of religion, but its very beginning and birth in thesoul. To enter on the religious life is to terminate the struggle. In that act which constitutes the beginning of the religious life—call itfaith, or trust, or self-surrender, or by whatever name you will—there is involved the identification of the finite with a life which iseternally realized. It is true indeed that the religious life is progressive; but understood in the light of the foregoing idea, religiousprogress is not progress towards, but within the sphere of the Infinite. It is not the vain attempt by endless finite additions or incrementsto become possessed of infinite wealth, but it is the endeavor, by the constant exercise of spiritual activity, to appropriate that infiniteinheritance of which we are already in possession. The whole future of the religious life is given in its beginning, but it is givenimplicitly. The position of the man who has entered on the religious life is that evil, error, imperfection, do not really belong to him: theyare excrescences which have no organic relation to his true nature: they are already virtually, as they will be actually, suppressed andannulled, and in the very process of being annulled they become the means of spiritual progress. Though he is not exempt fromtemptation and conflict, [yet] in that inner sphere in which his true life lies, the struggle is over, the victory already achieved. It is not afinite but an infinite life which the spirit lives. Every pulse-beat of its [existence] is the expression and realization of the life of God.\"1You will readily admit that no description of the phenomena of the religious consciousness could be better than thesewords of your lamented preacher and philosopher. They reproduce the very rapture of those crises of conversion of1John Caird: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion, London and New York, 1880, pp. 243 250, and 291 299, much abridged."},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP407 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 42]Page 407which we have been hearing; they utter what the mystic felt but was unable to communicate; and the saint, in hearingthem, recognizes his own experience. It is indeed gratifying to find the content of religion reported so unanimously.But when all is said and done, has Principal Carid—and I only use him as an example of that whole mode of thinking—transcended the sphere of feeling and of the direct experience of the individual, and laid the foundations of religionin impartial reason? Has he made religion universal by coercive reasoning, transformed it from a private faith into apublic certainty? Has he rescued its affirmations from obscurity and mystery?I believe that he has done nothing of the kind, but that he has simply reaffirmed the individual's experiences in a moregeneralized vocabulary. And again, I can be excused from proving technically that the transcendentalist reasoningsfail to make religion universal, for I can point to the plain fact that a majority of scholars, even religiously disposedones, stubbornly refuse to treat them as convincing. The whole of Germany, one may say, has positively rejected theHegelian argumentation. As for Scotland, I need only mention Professor Fraser's and Professor Pringle-Pattison'smemorable criticisms, with which so many of you are familiar.1 Once more, I ask, if transcendental idealism were asobjectively and absolutely rational as it pretends to be, could it possibly fail so egregiously to be persuasive?What religion reports, you must remember, always purports to be a fact of experience: the divine is actually present,religion says, and between it and ourselves relations of give and take are actual. If definite perceptions of fact like thiscannot stand upon their own feet, surely abstract reasoning1A. C.

Conceptual processes can class facts, define them, interpret them;but they do not produce them, nor can they reproduce their individuality. There is always a plus, a thisness, whichfeeling alone can answer for. Philosophy in this sphere is thus a secondary function, unable to warrant faith's veracity,and so I revert to the thesis which I announced at the beginning of this lecture.In all sad sincerity I think we must conclude that the attempt to demonstrate by purely intellectual processes the truthof the deliverance of direct religious experience is absolutely hopeless.It would be unfair to philosophy, however, to leave her under this negative sentence. Let me close, then, by brieflyenumerating what she can do for religion. If she will abandon metaphysics and deduction for criticism and induction,and frankly transform herself from theology into science of religions, she can make herself enormously useful.The spontaneous intellect of man always defines the divine which it feels in ways that harmonize with its temporaryintellectual prepossessions. Philosophy can by comparison eliminate the local and the accidental from thesedefinitions. Both from dogma and from worship she can remove historic incrustations. By confronting thespontaneous religious constructions with the results of natural science, philosophy can also eliminate doctrines that arenow known to be scientifically absurd or incongruous.Sifting out in this way unworthy formulations, she can(Footnote continued from previous page)to meet Professor Royce's arguments articulately. I admit the momentary evasion. In the present lectures, which are cast throughout in apopular mould, there seemed no room for subtle metaphysical discussion, and for tactical purposes it was sufficient, the contention ofphilosophy being what it is (namely, that religion can be transformed into a universally convincing science), to point to the fact that noreligious philosophy has actually convinced the mass of thinkers. Meanwhile let me say that I hope that the present volume may befollowed by another, if I am spared to write it, in which not only Professor Royce's arguments, but others for monistic absolutism shallbe considered with all the technical fullness which their great importance calls for. At present I resign myself to lying passive under thereproach of superficiality."},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP409 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 44]Page 409leave a residuum of conceptions that at least are possible. With these she can deal as hypotheses, testing them in allthe manners, whether negative or positive, by which hypotheses are ever tested. She can reduce their number, as someare found more open to objection. She can perhaps become the champion of one which she picks out as being themost closely verified or verifiable. She can refine upon the definition of this hypothesis, distinguishing between whatis innocent over-belief and symbolism in the expression of it, and what is to be literally taken. As a result, she canoffer mediation between different believers, and help to bring about consensus of opinion. She can do this the moresuccessfully, the better she discriminates the common and essential from the individual and local elements of thereligious beliefs which she compares.I do not see why a critical Science of Religions of this sort might not eventually command as general a publicadhesion as is commanded by a physical science. Even the personally non-religious might accept its conclusions ontrust, much as blind persons now accept the facts of optics—it might appear as foolish to refuse them. Yet as thescience of optics has to be fed in the first instance, and continually verified later, by facts experienced by seeingpersons; so the science of religions would depend for its original material on facts of personal experience, and wouldhave to square itself with personal experience through all its critical reconstructions. It could never get away fromconcrete life, or work in a conceptual vacuum. It would forever have to confess, as every science confesses, that thesubtlety of nature flies beyond it, and that its formulas are but approximations. Philosophy lives in words, but truthand fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation. There is in the living act of perception alwayssomething that glimmers and twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too late. No one knowsthis as well as the philosopher. He must fire his volley of new vocables out of his conceptual shotgun, for hisprofession condemns him to this industry, but he secretly knows the hollowness and irrelevancy.

We return to the empirical philosophy: the true is what works well, even though thequalification 'on the whole' may always have to be added. In this lecture we must revert to description again, andfinish our picture of the religious consciousness by a word about some of its other characteristic elements. Then, in afinal lecture, we shall be free to make a general review and draw our independent conclusions.The first point I will speak of is the part which the æsthetic life plays in determining one's choice of a religion. Men, Isaid awhile ago, involuntarily intellectualize their religious experience. They need formulas, just as they needfellowship in worship. I spoke, therefore, too contemptuously of the pragmatic uselessness of the famous scholasticlist of attributes of the deity, for they have one use which I neglected to consider. The eloquent passage in whichNewman enumerates them1 puts us on the track of it. Intoning them as he would intone a cathedral service, he showshow high is their æsthetic value. It enriches our bare piety to carry these exalted and mysterious verbal additions justas it enriches a church to have an organ and old brasses, marbles and frescoes and stained windows. Epithets lend anatmosphere and overtones to our devotion. They are like a hymn of praise and service of glory, and may sound themore sublime for being incomprehensible. Minds like Newman's2 grow as jealous of their credit as1Idea of a University, Discourse III. § 7.2Newman's imagination so innately craved a sacerdotal system that he can write: \"From the age of fifteen, dogma has been the fundamentalprinciple of my religion: I know no other religion; I cannot enter into the idea of any other sort of religion.\" And again, speaking of himselfabout the age of thirty, he writes: \"I loved to act as feeling myself in my Bishop's sight, as if it were the sight of God.\" Apologia, 1897, pp.48, 50."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP412 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 58]Page 412heathen priests are of that of the jewelry and ornaments that blaze upon their idols.Among the buildings-out of religion which the mind spontaneously indulges in, the æsthetic motive must never beforgotten. I promised to say nothing of ecclesiastical systems in these lectures. I may be allowed, however, to put in aword at this point on the way in which their satisfaction of certain æsthetic needs contributes to their hold on humannature. Although some persons aim most at intellectual purity and simplification, for others richness is the supremeimaginative requirement.1 When one's mind is strongly of this type, an individual religion will hardly serve thepurpose. The inner need is rather of something institutional and complex, majestic in the hierarchic interrelatedness ofits parts, with authority descending from stage to stage, and at every stage objects for adjectives of mystery andsplendor, derived in the last resort from the Godhead who is the fountain and culmination of the system. One feelsthen as if in presence of some vast incrusted work of jewelry or architecture; one hears the multitudinous liturgicalappeal; one gets the honorific vibration coming from every quarter. Compared with such a noble complexity, in whichascending and descending movements seem in no way to jar upon stability, in which no single item, however humble,is insignificant, because so many august institutions hold it in its place, how flat does evangelical Protestantismappear, how bare those isolated religious lives whose boast it is that ''man in1The intellectual difference is quite on a par in practical importance with the analogous difference in character. We saw, under the headof Saintliness, how some characters resent confusion and must live in purity, consistency, simplicity (above, p. 257 ff.). For others, onthe contrary, superabundance, over-pressure, stimulation, lots of superficial relations, are indispensable. There are men who would suffera very syncope if you should pay all their debts, bring it about that their engagements had been kept, their letters answered, theirperplexities relieved, and their duties fulfilled, down to one which lay on a clean table under their eyes with nothing to interfere with itsimmediate performance. A day stripped so staringly bare would be for them appalling. So with ease, elegance, tributes of affection, socialrecognitions—some of us require amounts of these things which to others would appear a mass of lying and sophistication."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP413 hl[01 03 2011 00 34 59]Page 413the bush with God may meet.\"1 What a pulverization and leveling of what a gloriously piled-up structure! To animagination used to the perspectives of dignity and glory, the naked gospel scheme seems to offer an almshouse for apalace.It is much like the patriotic sentiment of those brought up in ancient empires. How many emotions must be frustratedof their object, when one gives up the titles of dignity, the crimson lights and blare of brass, the gold embroidery, theplumed troops, the fear and trembling, and puts up with a president in a black coat who shakes hands with you, andcomes, it may be, from a 'home' upon a veldt or prairie with one sitting-room and a Bible on its centre-table. Itpauperizes the monarchical imagination!The strength of these æsthetic sentiments makes it rigorously impossible, it seems to me, that Protestantism, howeversuperior in spiritual profundity it may be to Catholicism, should at the present day succeed in making many convertsfrom the more venerable ecclesiasticism. The latter offers a so much richer pasturage and shade to the fancy, has somany cells with so many different kinds of honey, is so indulgent in its multiform appeals to human nature, thatProtestantism will always show to Catholic eyes the almshouse physiognomy. The bitter negativity of it is to theCatholic mind incomprehensible. To intellectual Catholics many of the antiquated beliefs and practices to which theChurch gives countenance are, if taken literally, as childish as they are to Protestants. But they are childish in thepleasing sense of 'childlike,'—innocent and amiable, and worthy to be smiled on in consideration of the undevelopedcondition of the dear people's intellects. To the Protestant, on the contrary, they are childish in the sense of beingidiotic falsehoods. He must stamp out their delicate and lovable redundancy, leaving the Catholic to shudder at hisliteralness. He appears to the latter as morose as if he were some hard-eyed, numb, monotonous kind of reptile. Thetwo will never understand each other—their centres of emotional energy are too different. Rigorous1In Newman's Lectures on Justification, Lecture VIII. § 6, there is a splendid passage expressive of this æsthetic way of feeling theChristian scheme. It is unfortunately too long to quote."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP414 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 01]Page 414truth and human nature's intricacies are always in need of a mutual interpreter.1 So much for the æsthetic diversities inthe religious consciousness.In most books on religion, three things are represented as its most essential elements. These are Sacrifice, Confession,and Prayer. I must say a word in turn of each of these elements, though briefly. First of Sacrifice.Sacrifices to gods are omnipresent in primeval worship; but, as cults have grown refined, burnt offerings and theblood of he-goats have been superseded by sacrifices more spiritual in their nature. Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism getalong without ritual sacrifice; so does Christianity, save in so far as the notion is preserved in transfigured form in themystery of Christ's atonement. These religions substitute offerings of the heart, renunciations of the inner self, for allthose vain oblations. In the ascetic practices which Islam, Buddhism, and the older Christianity encourage we see howindestructible is the idea that sacrifice of some sort is a religious exercise. In lecturing on asceticism I spoke of itssignificance as symbolic of the sacrifices which life, whenever it is taken strenuously, calls for.2 But, as I said my sayabout those, and as these lectures expressly avoid earlier religious usages and questions of derivation, I will pass fromthe subject of Sacrifice altogether and turn to that of Confession.In regard to Confession I will also be most brief, saying my word about it psychologically, not historically. Not nearlyas widespread as sacrifice, it corresponds to a more inward and moral stage of sentiment. It is part of the generalsystem of purgation and cleansing which one feels one's self in need of, in order to be in right relations to one's deity.For him who1Compare the informality of Protestantism, where the 'meek lover of the good,' alone with his God, visits the sick, etc., for their ownsakes, with the elaborate 'business' that goes on in Catholic devotion, and carries with it the social excitement of all more complexbusinesses. An essentially worldlyminded Catholic woman can become a visitor of the sick on purely coquettish principles, with herconfessor and director, her 'merit' storing up, her patron saints, her privileged relation to the Almighty, drawing his attention as aprofessional dévote, her definite 'exercises,' and her definitely recognized social pose in the organization.2Above, p. 328 ff."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP415 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 02]Page 415confesses, shams are over and realities have begun; he has exteriorized his rottenness. If he has not actually got rid ofit, he at least no longer smears it over with a hypocritical show of virtue—he lives at least upon a basis of veracity.The complete decay of the practice of confession in Anglo-Saxon communities is a little hard to account for. Reactionagainst popery is of course the historic explanation, for in popery confession went with penances and absolution, andother inadmissible practices. But on the side of the sinner himself it seems as if the need ought to have been too greatto accept so summary a refusal of its satisfaction. One would think that in more men the shell of secrecy would havehad to open, the pent-in abscess to burst and gain relief, even though the ear that heard the confession were unworthy.The Catholic church, for obvious utilitarian reasons, has substituted auricular confession to one priest for the moreradical act of public confession. We English-speaking Protestants, in the general self-reliance and unsociability of ournature, seem to find it enough if we take God alone into our confidence.1The next topic on which I must comment is Prayer,—and this time it must be less briefly. We have heard much talk oflate against prayer, especially against prayers for better weather and for the recovery of sick people. As regardsprayers for the sick, if any medical fact can be considered to stand firm, it is that in certain environments prayer maycontribute to recovery, and should be encouraged as a therapeutic measure. Being a normal factor of moral health inthe person, its omission would be deleterious. The case of the weather is different. Notwithstanding the recency of theopposite belief,2 every one now knows that droughts and storms follow from physical antecedents, and that moralappeals cannot avert them. But petitional prayer is only one department1A fuller discussion of confession is contained in the excellent work by FRANK GRANGER: The Soul of a Christian, London, 1900, ch. xii.2Example: \"The minister at Sudbury, being at the Thursday lecture in Boston, heard the officiating clergyman praying for rain. As soon asthe service was over, he went to the petitioner and said, 'You Boston ministers, as soon as a tulip wilts under your windows, go to church andpray for rain, until all Concord and Sudbury are under water.'\" R. W. EMERSON: Lectures and Biographical Sketches, p. 363."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP416 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 03]Page 416of prayer; and if we take the word in the wider sense as meaning every kind of inward communion or conversationwith the power recognized as divine, we can easily see that scientific criticism leaves it untouched.Prayer in this wide sense is the very soul and essence of religion. \"Religion,\" says a liberal French theologian, \"is anintercourse, a conscious and voluntary relation, entered into by a soul in distress with the mysterious power uponwhich it feels itself to depend, and upon which its fate is contingent. This intercourse with God is realized by prayer.Prayer is religion in act; that is, prayer is real religion. It is prayer that distinguishes the religious phenomenon fromsuch similar or neighboring phenomena as purely moral or æsthetic sentiment. Religion is nothing if it be not the vitalact by which the entire mind seeks to save itself by clinging to the principle from which it draws its life. This act isprayer, by which term I understand no vain exercise of words, no mere repetition of certain sacred formulæ, but thevery movement itself of the soul, putting itself in a personal relation of contact with the mysterious power of which itfeels the presence,—it may be even before it has a name by which to call it. Wherever this interior prayer is lacking,there is no religion; wherever, on the other hand, this prayer rises and stirs the soul, even in the absence of forms or ofdoctrines, we have living religion. One sees from this why 'natural religion,' so-called, is not properly a religion. Itcuts man off from prayer. It leaves him and God in mutual remoteness, with no intimate commerce, no interiordialogue, no interchange, no action of God in man, no return of man to God. At bottom this pretended religion is onlya philosophy. Born at epochs of rationalism, of critical investigations, it never was anything but an abstraction. Anartificial and dead creation, it reveals to its examiner hardly one of the characters proper to religion.\"1It seems to me that the entire series of our lectures proves the truth of M. Sabatier's contention. The religiousphenomenon, studied as an inner fact, and apart from ecclesiastical or theological complications, has shown itself toconsist everywhere, and at all its stages, in the consciousness which indi-1AUGUSTE SABATIER: Esquisse d'une Philosophie de la Religion, 2me ́d., 1897, pp. 24 26, abridged."},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP417 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 04]Page 417viduals have of an intercourse between themselves and higher powers with which they feel themselves to be related.This intercourse is realized at the time as being both active and mutual. If it be not effective; if it be not a give andtake relation; if nothing be really transacted while it lasts; if the world is in no whit different for its having takenplace; then prayer, taken in this wide meaning of a sense that something is transacting, is of course a feeling of whatis illusory, and religion must on the whole be classed, not simply as containing elements of delusion,—theseundoubtedly everywhere exist,—but as being rooted in delusion altogether, just as materialists and atheists havealways said it was. At most there might remain, when the direct experiences of prayer were ruled out as falsewitnesses, some inferential belief that the whole order of existence must have a divine cause. But this way ofcontemplating nature, pleasing as it would doubtless be to persons of a pious taste, would leave to them but thespectators' part at a play, whereas in experimental religion and the prayerful life, we seem ourselves to be the actors,and to act, not in a play, but in a very serious reality.The genuineness of religion is thus indissolubly bound up with the question whether the prayerful consciousness be orbe not deceitful. The conviction that something is genuinely transacted in this consciousness is the very core of livingreligion. As to what is transacted, great differences of opinion have prevailed. The unseen powers have beensupposed, and are yet supposed, to do things which no enlightened man can nowadays believe in. It may well provethat the sphere of influence in prayer is subjective exclusively, and that what is immediately changed is only the mindof the praying person. But however our opinion of prayer's effects may come to be limited by criticism, religion, in thevital sense in which these lectures study it, must stand or fall by the persuasion that effects of some sort genuinely dooccur. Through prayer, religion insists, things which cannot be realized in any other manner come about: energywhich but for prayer would be bound is by prayer set free and operates in some part, be it objective or subjective, ofthe world of facts.This postulate is strikingly expressed in a letter written by the late Frederic W. H. Myers to a friend, who allows meto"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP418 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 05]Page 418quote from it. It shows how independent the prayer-instinct is of usual doctrinal complications. Mr. Myers writes:—\"I am glad that you have asked me about prayer, because I have rather strong ideas on the subject. First consider what are the facts. Thereexists around us a spiritual universe, and that universe is in actual relation with the material. From the spiritual universe comes theenergy which maintains the material; the energy which makes the life of each individual spirit. Our spirits are supported by a perpetualindrawal of this energy, and the vigor of that indrawal is perpetually changing, much as the vigor of our absorption of material nutrimentchanges from hour to hour.\"I call these 'facts' because I think that some scheme of this kind is the only one consistent with our actual evidence; too complex tosummarize here. How, then, should we act on these facts? Plainly we must endeavor to draw in as much spiritual life as possible, and wemust place our minds in any attitude which experience shows to be favorable to such indrawal. Prayer is the general name for thatattitude of open and earnest expectancy. If we then ask to whom to pray, the answer (strangely enough) must be that that does not muchmatter. The prayer is not indeed a purely subjective thing;—it means a real increase in intensity of absorption of spiritual power or grace;—but we do not know enough of what takes place in the spiritual world to know how the prayer operates;—who is cognizant of it, orthrough what channel the grace is given. Better let children pray to Christ, who is at any rate the highest individual spirit of whom wehave any knowledge. But it would be rash to say that Christ himself hears us; while to say that God hears us is merely to restate the firstprinciple,—that grace flows in from the infinite spiritual world.\"Let us reserve the question of the truth or falsehood of the belief that power is absorbed until the next lecture, whenour dogmatic conclusions, if we have any, must be reached. Let this lecture still confine itself to the description ofphenomena; and as a concrete example of an extreme sort, of the way in which the prayerful life may still be led, letme take a case"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP419 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 06]Page 419with which most of you must be acquainted, that of George Müller of Bristol, who died in 1898. Müller's prayerswere of the crassest petitional order. Early in life he resolved on taking certain Bible promises in literal sincerity, andon letting himself be fed, not by his own worldly foresight, but by the Lord's hand. He had an extraordinarily activeand successful career, among the fruits of which were the distribution of over two million copies of the Scripture text,in different languages; the equipment of several hundred missionaries; the circulation of more than a hundred andeleven million of scriptural books, pamphlets, and tracts; the building of five large orphanages, and the keeping andeducating of thousands of orphans; finally, the establishment of schools in which over a hundred and twenty-onethousand youthful and adult pupils were taught. In the course of this work Mr. Müller received and administerednearly a million and a half of pounds sterling, and traveled over two hundred thousand miles of sea and land.1 Duringthe sixty-eight years of his ministry, he never owned any property except his clothes and furniture, and cash in hand;and he left, at the age of eighty-six, an estate worth only a hundred and sixty pounds.His method was to let his general wants be publicly known, but not to acquaint other people with the details of his temporary necessities.For the relief of the latter, he prayed directly to the Lord, believing that sooner or later prayers are always answered if one have trustenough. \"When I lose such a thing as a key,\" he writes, \"I ask the Lord to direct me to it, and I look for an answer to my prayer; when aperson with whom I have made an appointment does not come, according to the fixed time, and I begin to be inconvenienced by it, I askthe Lord to be pleased to hasten him to me, and I look for an answer; when I do not understand a passage of the word of God, I lift upmy heart to the Lord that he would be pleased by his Holy Spirit to instruct me, and I expect to be taught, though I do not fix the timewhen, and the manner how it should be; when I am going to minister in the Word, I seek1My authority for these statistics is the little work on Müller, by FREDERIC G.

From this day and henceforward whilst the Lord gives to us oursupplies by the day, we purpose to pay at once for every article as it is purchased, and never to buy anything except we can pay for it atonce, however much it may seem to be needed, and however much those with whom we deal may wish to be paid only by the week.\"The articles needed of which Müller speaks were the food, fuel, etc., of his orphanages. Somehow, near as they often come to goingwithout a meal, they hardly ever seem actually to have done so. \"Greater and more manifest nearness of the Lord's presence I have neverhad than when after breakfast there were no means for dinner for more than a hundred persons; or when after dinner there were no meansfor the tea, and yet the Lord provided the tea; and all this without one single human being having been informed about our need. Through Grace my mind is so fully assured of the faithfulness of the Lord, that in the midst of the greatest need, I am enabled in peace togo about my other work. Indeed, did not the Lord give me this, which is the result of trusting in him, I should scarcely be able to work atall; for it is now comparatively a rare thing that a day comes when I am not in need for one or another part of the work.\"1In building his orphanages simply by prayer and faith, Müller affirms that his prime motive was \"to have something to point to as avisible proof that our God and Father is the same faithful God that he ever was,—as willing as ever to prove himself the living God, inour day as formerly, to all that put their trust in him.\"2 For this reason1The Life of Trust; Being a Narrative of the Lord's Dealings with George Müller, New American edition, N.

Wecertainly weaken faith instead of increasing it; and each time we work thus a deliverance of our own we find it more and more difficult totrust in God, till at last we give way entirely to our natural fallen reason and unbelief prevails. How different if one is enabled to waitGod's own time, and to look alone to him for help and deliverance! When at last help comes, after many seasons of prayer it may be,how sweet it is, and what a present recompense! Dear Christian reader, if you have never walked in this path of obedience before, do sonow, and you will then know experimentally the sweetness of the joy which results from it.\"1When the supplies came in but slowly, Müller always considered that this was for the trial of his faith and patience. When his faith andpatience had been sufficiently tried, the Lord would send more means. \"And thus it has proved,\"—I quote from his diary,—\"for to-daywas given me the sum of 2050 pounds, of which 2000 are for the building fund [of a certain house], and 50 for present necessities. It isimpossible to describe my joy in God when I received this donation. I was neither excited nor surprised; for I look out for answers to myprayers. I believe that God hears me. Yet my heart was so full of joy that I could only sit before God, and admire him, like David in 2Samuel vii. At last I cast myself flat down upon my face and burst forth in thanksgiving to God an din surrendering my heart afresh tohim for his blessed service.\"2George Müller's is a case extreme in every respect, and in no respect more so than in the extraordinary narrowness ofthe man's intellectual horizon. His God was, as he often said, his business partner. He seems to have been for Müllerlittle more than a sort of supernatural clergyman interested in the congregation of tradesmen and others in Bristol whowere his saints, and in the orphanages and other enterprises, but unpossessed of any of those vaster and wilder andmore ideal1Op. cit., p. 383, abridged.2Ibid., p. 323."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP422 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 10]Page 422attributes with which the human imagination elsewhere has invested him. Müller, in short, was absolutelyunphilosophical. His intensely private and practical conception of his relations with the Deity continued the traditionsof the most primitive human thought.1 When we compare a mind like his with such a mind as, for example, Emerson'sor Phillips Brooks's, we see the range which the religious consciousness covers.There is an immense literature relating to answers to petitional prayer. The evangelical journals are filled with suchanswers, and books are devoted to the subject,2 but for us Müller's case will suffice.1I cannot resist the temptation of quoting an expression of an even more primitive style of religious thought, which I find in Arber'sEnglish Garland, vol. vii. p. 440. Robert Lyde, an English sailor, along with an English boy, being prisoners on a French ship in 1689, setupon the crew, of seven Frenchmen, killed two, made the other five prisoners, and brought home the ship. Lyde thus describes how inthis feat he found his God a very present help in time of trouble:—''With the assistance of God I kept my feet when they three and one more did strive to throw me down. Feeling the Frenchman which hungabout my middle hang very heavy, I said to the boy, 'Go round the binnacle, and knock down that man that hangeth on my back.' So the boydid strike him one blow on the head which made him fall. Then I looked about for a marlin spike or anything else to strike them withal. Butseeing nothing, I said, 'LORD! what shall I do?' Then casting up my eye upon my left side, and seeing a marlin spike hanging, I jerked myright arm and took hold, and struck the point four times about a quarter of an inch deep into the skull of that man that had hold of my leftarm. [One of the Frenchmen then hauled the marlin spike away from him.] But through GOD'S wonderful providence! it either fell out of hishand, or else he threw it down, and at this time the Almighty GOD gave me strength enough to take one man in one hand, and throw at theother's head: and looking about again to see anything to strike them withal, but seeing nothing, I said, 'LORD! what shall I do now?' And thenit pleased GOD to put me in mind of my knife in my pocket. And although two of the men had hold of my right arm, yet GOD Almightystrengthened me so that I put my right hand into my right pocket, drew out the knife and sheath, put it between my legs and drew it out, andthen cut the man's throat with it that had his back to my breast: and he immediately dropt down, and scarce ever stirred after.\"—I haveslightly abridged Lyde's narrative.2As, for instance, In Answer to Prayer, by the BISHOP OF RIPON and others, London, 1898; Touching Incidents and Remarkable Answers toPrayer, Harrisburg, Pa., 1898 (?); H. L.

Persistencein leaning on the Almighty for support and guidance will, such persons say, bring with it proofs, palpable but muchmore subtle, of his presence and active influence. The following description of a 'led' life, by a Swiss writer whom Ihave already quoted, would no doubt appear to countless Christians in every country as if transcribed from their ownpersonal experience. One finds in this guided sort of life, says Dr. Hilty,—\"That books and words (and sometimes people) come to one's cognizance just at the very moment in which one needs them; that oneglides over great dangers as if with shut eyes, remaining ignorant of what would have terrified one or led one astray, until the peril is past—this being especially the case with temptations to vanity and sensuality; that paths on which one ought not to wander are, as it were,hedged off with thorns; but that on the other side great obstacles are suddenly removed; that when the time has come for something, onesuddenly receives a courage that formerly failed, or perceives the root of a matter that until then was concealed, or discovers thoughts,talents, yea, even pieces of knowledge and insight, in one's self, of which it is impossible to say whence they come; finally, that personshelp us or decline to help us, favor us or refuse us, as if they had to do so against their will, so that often those indifferent or evenunfriendly to us yield us the greatest service and furtherance. (God takes often their worldly goods, from those whom he leads, at just theright moment, when they threaten to impede the effort after higher interests.)\"Besides all this, other noteworthy things come to pass, of which it is not easy to give account. There is no doubt whatever that now onewalks continually through 'open doors' and on the easiest roads, with as little care and trouble as it is possible to imagine.\"Furthermore one finds one's self settling one's affairs neither too early nor too late, whereas they were wont to be spoiled byuntimeliness, even when the preparations had been well laid. In addition to this, one does them with"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP424 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 17]Page 424perfect tranquillity of mind, almost as if they were matters of no consequence, like errands done by us for another person, in which casewe usually act more calmly than when we act in our own concerns. Again, one finds that one can wait for everything patiently, and thatis one of life's great arts. One finds also that each thing comes duly, one thing after the other, so that one gains time to make one's footingsure before advancing farther. And then everything occurs to us at the right moment, just what we ought to do, etc., and often in a verystriking way, just as if a third person were keeping watch over those things which we are in easy danger of forgetting.\"Often, too, persons are sent to us at the right time, to offer or ask for what is needed, and what we should never have had the courage orresolution to undertake of our own accord.\"Through all these experiences one finds that one is kindly and tolerant of other people, even of such as are repulsive, negligent, or ill-willed, for they also are instruments of good in God's hand, and often most efficient ones. Without these thoughts it would be hard foreven the best of us always to keep our equanimity. But with the consciousness of divine guidance, one sees many a thing in life quitedifferently from what would otherwise be possible.\"All these are things that every human being knows, who has had experience of them; and of which the most speaking examples could bebrought forward. The highest resources of worldly wisdom are unable to attain that which, under divine leading, comes to us of its ownaccord.\"1Such accounts as this shade away into others where the belief is, not that particular events are tempered more towardlyto us by a superintending providence, as a reward for our reliance, but that by cultivating the continuous sense of ourconnection with the power that made things as they are, we are tempered more towardly for their reception. Theoutward face of nature need not alter, but the expressions of meaning in it alter. It was dead and is alive again. It islike the differ-1C.

In the latter case intercoursesprings into new vitality. So when one's affections keep in touch with the divinity of the world's authorship, fear andegotism fall away; and in the equanimity that follows, one finds in the hours, as they succeed each other, a series ofpurely benignant opportunities. It is as if all doors were opened, and all paths freshly smoothed. We meet a new worldwhen we meet the old world in the spirit which this kind of prayer infuses.Such a spirit was that of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.1 It is that of mind-curers, of the transcendentalists, and of theso-called 'liberal' Christians. As an expression of it, I will quote a page from one of Martineau's sermons:—\"The universe, open to the eye to-day, looks as it did a thousand years ago: and the morning hymn of Milton does but tell the beautywith which our own familiar sun dressed the earliest fields and gardens of the world. We see what all our fathers saw. And if we cannotfind God in your house or in mine, upon the roadside or the margin of the sea; in the bursting seed or opening flower; in the day duty orthe night musing; in the general laugh and the secret grief; in the procession of life, ever entering afresh, and solemnly passing by anddropping off; I do not think we should discern him any more on the grass of Eden, or beneath the moonlight of Gethsemane. Depend uponit, it is not the want of greater miracles, but of the soul to perceive such1\"Good Heaven!\" says Epictetus, \"any one thing in the creation is sufficient to demonstrate a Providence, to a humble and grateful mind.The mere possibility of producing milk from grass, cheese from milk, and wool from skins; who formed and planned it? Ought we not,whether we dig or plough or eat, to sing this hymn to God? Great is God, who has supplied us with these instruments to till the ground;great is God, who has given us hands and instruments of digestion; who has given us to grow insensibly and to breathe in sleep. Thesethings we ought forever to celebrate. But because the most of you are blind and insensible, there must be some one to fill this station,and lead, in behalf of all men, the hymn to God; for what else can I do, a lame old man, but sing hymns to God? Were I a nightingale, Iwould act the part of a nightingale; were I a swan, the part of a swan. But since I am a reasonable creature, it is my duty to praise God and I call on you to join the same song.\" Works, book i. ch. xvi., CARTER-HIGGINSON translation, abridged."},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP426 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 21]Page 426as are allowed us still, that makes us push all the sanctities into the far spaces we cannot reach. The devout feel that wherever God's handis, there is miracle: and it is simply an indevoutness which imagines that only where miracle is, can there be the real hand of God. Thecustoms of Heaven ought surely to be more sacred in our eyes than its anomalies; the dear old ways, of which the Most High is nevertired, than the strange things which he does not love well enough ever to repeat. And he who will but discern beneath the sun, as he risesany morning, the supporting finger of the Almighty, may recover the sweet and reverent surprise with which Adam gazed on the firstdawn in Paradise. It is no outward change, no shifting in time or place; but only the loving meditation of the pure in heart, that canreawaken the Eternal from the sleep within our souls: that can render him a reality again, and reassert for him once more his ancientname of 'the Living God.'\"1When we see all things in God, and refer all things to him, we read in common matters superior expressions ofmeaning. The deadness with which custom invests the familiar vanishes, and existence as a whole appearstransfigured. The state of a mind thus awakened from torpor is well expressed in these words, which I take from afriend's letter:—\"If we occupy ourselves in summing up all the mercies and bounties we are privileged to have, we are overwhelmed by their number (sogreat that we can imagine ourselves unable to give ourselves time even to begin to review the things we may imagine we have not). Wesum them and realize that we are actually killed with God's kindness; that we are surrounded by bounties upon bounties, without whichall would fall. Should we not love it; should we not feel buoyed up by the Eternal Arms?\"Sometimes this realization that facts are of divine sending, instead of being habitual, is casual, like a mysticalexperience.1JAMES MARTINEAU: end of the sermon 'Help Thou Mine Unbelief,' in Endeavours after a Christian Life, 2d series.

It was a poor drummerbeating the tattoo in the streets of Paris. I walked behind him in returning to the school on the evening of a holiday. His drum gave outthe tattoo in such a way that, at that moment at least, however peevish I were, I could find no pretext for fault-finding. It was impossibleto conceive more nerve or spirit, better time or measure, more clearness or richness, than were in this drumming. Ideal desire could go nofarther in that direction. I was enchanted and consoled; the perfection of this wretched act did me good. Good is at least possible, I said,since the ideal can thus sometimes get embodied.\"1In Sénancour's novel of Obermann a similar transient lifting of the veil is recorded. In Paris streets, on a March day,he comes across a flower in bloom, a jonquil:\"It was the strongest expression of desire: it was the first perfume of the year. I felt all the happiness destined for man. This unutterableharmony of souls, the phantom of the ideal world, arose in me complete. I never felt anything so great or so instantaneous. I know notwhat shape, what analogy, what secret of relation it was that made me see in this flower a limitless beauty. I shall never inclose in aconception this power, this immensity that nothing will express; this form that nothing will contain; this ideal of a better world which onefeels, but which, it seems, nature has not made actual.\"2We heard in previous lectures of the vivified face of the world as it may appear to converts after their awakening.3 Asa rule, religious persons generally assume that whatever natural facts connect themselves in any way with their destinyare significant of the divine purposes with them.

So long as this operativeness isadmitted to be real, it makes no essential difference whether its immediate effects be subjective or objective. Thefundamental religious point is that in prayer, spiritual energy, which otherwise would slumber, does become active,and spiritual work of some kind is effected really.So much for Prayer, taken in the wide sense of any kind of communion. As the core of religion, we must return to itin the next lecture.The last aspect of the religious life which remains for me to touch upon is the fact that its manifestations so frequentlyconnect themselves with the subconscious part of our existence. You may remember what I said in my openinglecture1 about the prevalence of the psychopathic temperament in religious biography. You will in point of fact hardlyfind a religious leader of any kind in whose life there is no record of automatisms. I speak not merely of savage priestsand prophets, whose followers regard automatic utterance and action as by itself tantamount to inspiration, I speak ofleaders of thought and subjects of intellectualized experience. Saint Paul had his visions, his ecstasies, his gift oftongues, small as was the importance he attached to the latter. The whole array of Christian saints and heresiarchs,including the greatest, the Bernards, the Loyolas, the Luthers, the Foxes, the Wesleys, had their visions, voices, raptconditions, guiding impressions, and 'openings.' They had these things, because they had exalted sensibility, and tosuch things persons of exalted sensibility are liable. In such liability there lie, however, consequences for theology.Beliefs are strengthened wherever automatisms corroborate them. Incursions from beyond the transmarginal regionhave a peculiar power to increase conviction. The inchoate sense of presence is infinitely stronger1Above, pp. 30, 31."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP429 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 35]Page 429than conception, but strong as it may be, it is seldom equal to the evidence of hallucination. Saints who actually see orhear their Saviour reach the acme of assurance. Motor automatisms, though rarer, are, if possible, even moreconvincing than sensations. The subjects here actually feel themselves played upon by powers beyond their will. Theevidence is dynamic; the God or spirit moves the very organs of their body.1The great field for this sense of being the instrument of a higher power is of course 'inspiration.' It is easy todiscriminate between the religious leaders who have been habitually subject to inspiration and those who have not. Inthe teachings of the Buddha, of Jesus, of Saint Paul (apart from his gift of tongues), of Saint Augustine, of Huss, ofLuther, of Wesley, automatic or semi-automatic composition appears to have been only occasional. In the Hebrewprophets, on the contrary, in Mohammed, in some of the Alexandrians, in many minor Catholic saints, in Fox, inJoseph Smith, something like it appears to have been frequent, sometimes habitual. We have distinct professions ofbeing under the direction of a foreign power, and serving as its mouthpiece. As regards the Hebrew prophets, it isextraordinary, writes an author who has made a careful study of them, to see—1A friend of mine, a first-rate psychologist, who is a subject of graphic automatism, tells me that the appearance of independent actuationin the movements of his arm, when he writes automatically, is so distinct that it obliges him to abandon a psychophysical theory whichhe had previously believed in, the theory, namely, that we have no feeling of the discharge downwards of our voluntary motor-centres.We must normally have such a feeling, he thinks, or the sense of an absence would not be so striking as it is in these experiences.Graphic automatism of a fully developed kind is rare in religious history, so far as my knowledge goes. Such statements as AntoniaBourignon's, that \"I do nothing but lend my hand and spirit to another power than mine,\" is shown by the context to indicate inspirationrather than directly automatic writing. In some eccentric sects this latter occurs. The most striking instance of it is probably the bulkyvolume called, 'Oahspe, a new Bible in the Words of Jehovah and his angel ambassadors,' Boston and London, 1891, written andillustrated automatically by DR. NEWBROUGH of New York, whom I understand to be now, or to have been lately, at the head of thespiritistic community of Shalam in New Mexico. The latest automatically written book which has come under my notice is 'Zertoulem'sWisdom of the Ages,' by GEORGE A. FULLER, Boston, 1901."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP430 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 36]Page 430\"How, one after another, the same features are reproduced in the prophetic books. The process is always extremely different from what itwould be if the prophet arrived at his insight into spiritual things by the tentative efforts of his own genius. There is something sharp andsudden about it. He can lay his finger, so to speak, on the moment when it came. And it always comes in the form of an overpoweringforce from without, against which he struggles, but in vain. Listen, for instance, [to] the opening of the book of Jeremiah. Read through inlike manner the first two chapters of the prophecy of Ezekiel.\"It is not, however, only at the beginning of his career that the prophet passes through a crisis which is clearly not self-caused. Scatteredall through the prophetic writings are expressions which speak of some strong and irresistible impulse coming down upon the prophet,determining his attitude to the events of his time, constraining his utterance, making his words the vehicle of a higher meaning than theirown. For instance, this of Isaiah's: 'The Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand,'—an emphatic phrase which denotes the overmasteringnature of the impulse,—'and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people.' Or passages like this from Ezekiel: 'Thehand of the Lord God fell upon me,' 'The hand of the Lord was strong upon me.' The one standing characteristic of the prophet is that hespeaks with the authority of Jehovah himself. Hence it is that the prophets one and all preface their addresses so confidently, 'The Wordof the Lord,' or 'Thus saith the Lord.' They have even the audacity to speak in the first person, as if Jehovah himself were speaking. As inIsaiah: 'Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called; I am He, I am the First, I also am the last,'—and so on. The personality of theprophet sinks entirely into the background; he feels himself for the time being the mouthpiece of the Almighty.\"1\"We need to remember that prophecy was a profession, and that the prophets formed a professional class. There were schools of theprophets, in which the gift was regu-1W.

A group of young men would gather round some commanding figure—a Samuel or an Elisha—and would not onlyrecord or spread the knowledge of his sayings and doings, but seek to catch themselves something of his inspiration. It seems that musicplayed its part in their exercises. It is perfectly clear that by no means all of these Sons of the prophets ever succeeded in acquiring morethan a very small share in the gift which they sought. It was clearly possible to 'counterfeit' prophecy. Sometimes this was donedeliberately. But it by no means follows that in all cases where a false message was given, the giver of it was altogether conscious ofwhat he was doing.\"1Here, to take another Jewish case, is the way in which Philo of Alexandria describes his inspiration:—\"Sometimes, when I have come to my work empty, I have suddenly become full; ideas being in an invisible manner showered upon me,and implanted in me from on high; so that through the influence of divine inspiration, I have become greatly excited, and have knownneither the place in which I was, nor those who were present, nor myself, nor what I was saying, nor what I was writing; for then I havebeen conscious of a richness of interpretation, an enjoyment of light, a most penetrating insight, a most manifest energy in all that was tobe done; having such effect on my mind as the clearest ocular demonstration would have on the eyes.\"2If we turn to Islam, we find that Mohammed's revelations all came from the subconscious sphere. To the question inwhat way he got them,—\"Mohammed is said to have answered that sometimes he heard a knell as from a bell, and that this had the strongest effect on him; andwhen the angel went away, he had1Op. cit., p. 91.

Mr. Clissold is a Swedenborgian. Swedenborg'scase is of course the palmary one of audita et visa, serving as a basis of religious revelation."},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP432 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 39]Page 432received the revelation. Sometimes again he held converse with the angel as with a man, so as easily to understand his words. The laterauthorities, however, distinguish still other kinds. In the Itqân (103) the following are enumerated: 1, revelations with sound of bell, 2,by inspiration of the holy spirit in M.'s heart, 3, by Gabriel in human form, 4, by God immediately, either when awake (as in his journeyto heaven) or in dream. In Almawâhib alladunîya the kinds are thus given: 1, Dream, 2, Inspiration of Gabriel in the Prophet's heart, 3,Gabriel taking Dahya's form, 4, with the bell-sound, etc., 5, Gabriel in propriâ personâ (only twice), 6, revelation in heaven, 7, Godappearing in person, but veiled, 8, God revealing himself immediately without veil. Others add two other stages, namely: 1, Gabriel in theform of still another man, 2, God showing himself personally in dream.''1In none of these cases is the revelation distinctly motor. In the case of Joseph Smith (who had prophetic revelationsinnumerable in addition to the revealed translation of the gold plates which resulted in the Book of Mormon),although there may have been a motor element, the inspiration seems to have been predominantly sensorial. He beganhis translation by the aid of the 'peep-stones' which he found, or thought or said that he found, with the gold plates,—apparently a case of 'crystal gazing.' For some of the other revelations he used the peep-stones, but seems generally tohave asked the Lord for more direct instruction.2Other revelations are described as 'openings'—Fox's, for example, were evidently of the kind known in spiritisticcircles1NÖLDEKE, Geschichte des Qorâns, 1860, p. 16. Compare the fuller account in Sir WILLIAM MUIR'S Life of Mahomet, 3d ed., 1894, ch.iii.2The Mormon theocracy has always been governed by direct revelations accorded to the President of the Church and its Apostles. From anobliging letter written to me in 1899 by an eminent Mormon, I quote the following extract:—\"It may be very interesting for you to know that the President [Mr. Snow] of the Mormon Church claims to have had a number of revelationsvery recently from heaven. To explain fully what these revelations are, it is necessary to know that we, as a people, believe that the Churchof Jesus Christ has again been established through messengers sent from heaven. This Church has at its head a prophet, seer, and revelator,who gives to man God's holy(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP433 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 40]Page 433of to-day as 'impressions.' As all effective initiators of change must needs live to some degree upon this psychopathiclevel of sudden perception or conviction of new truth, or of impulse to action so obsessive that it must be worked off,I will say nothing more about so very common a phenomenon.When, in addition to these phenomena of inspiration, we take religious mysticism into the account, when we recall thestriking and sudden unifications of a discordant self which we saw in conversion, and when we review the extravagantobsessions of tenderness, purity, and self-severity met with in saintliness, we cannot, I think, avoid the conclusion thatin religion we have a department of human nature with unusually close relations to the transmarginal or subliminalregion. If the word 'subliminal' is offensive to any of you, as smelling too much of psychical research or otheraberrations, call it by any other name you please, to distinguish it from the level of full sunlit consciousness. Call thislatter the A-region of personality, if you care to, and call the other the B-region. The B-region, then, is obviously thelarger part of each of us, for it is the abode of everything that is latent and the reservoir of everything that passesunrecorded or unobserved. It contains, for example, such things as all our momentarily inactive memories, and itharbors the springs of all our obscurely motived passions, impulses, likes, dislikes, and prejudices. Our intuitions,hypotheses, fancies, superstitions, persuasions, convictions, and in general all our non-rational operations, come fromit. It is the source of our dreams, and apparently they may return to it. In it arise whatever mystical experiences wemay have, and our automatisms, sensory or motor; our life in hypnotic and 'hypnoid' conditions, if we are subjects tosuch conditions; our delusions, fixed ideas, and hysterical accidents, if we are hysteric subjects; our supra-normalcognitions, if such there be, and if we are telepathic subjects. It is also the fountain-head of much that feeds ourreligion. In(Footnote continued from previous page)will. Revelation is the means through which the will of God is declared directly and in fullness to man. These revelations are got throughdreams of sleep or in waking visions of the mind, by voices without visional appearance, or by actual manifestations of the Holy Presencebefore the eye.

In the nextlecture, which is also the last one, we must try to draw the critical conclusions which so much material may suggest."},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP435 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 42]Page 435Lecture XXConclusionsThe material of our study of human nature is now spread before us; and in this parting hour, set free from the duty ofdescription, we can draw our theoretical and practical conclusions. In my first lecture, defending the empiricalmethod, I foretold that whatever conclusions we might come to could be reached by spiritual judgments only,appreciations of the significance for life of religion, taken 'on the whole.' Our conclusions cannot be as sharp asdogmatic conclusions would be, but I will formulate them, when the time comes, as sharply as I can.Summing up in the broadest possible way the characteristics of the religious life, as we have found them, it includesthe following beliefs:—1. That the visible world is part of a more spiritual universe from which it draws its chief significance;2. That union or harmonious relation with that higher universe is our true end;3. That prayer or inner communion with the spirit thereof—be that spirit 'God' or 'law'—is a process wherein work isreally done, and spiritual energy flows in and produces effects, psychological or material, within the phenomenalworld.Religion includes also the following psychological characteristics:—4. A new zest which adds itself like a gift to life, and takes the form either of lyrical enchantment or of appeal toearnestness and heroism.5. An assurance of safety and a temper of peace, and, in relation to others, a preponderance of loving affections.In illustrating these characteristics by documents, we have been literally bathed in sentiment. In re-reading mymanuscript, I am almost appalled at the amount of emotionality which I find in it. After so much of this, we canafford to be dryer and less sympathetic in the rest of the work that lies before us."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP436 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 43]Page 436The sentimentality of many of my documents is a consequence of the fact that I sought them among the extravagancesof the subject. If any of you are enemies of what our ancestors used to brand as enthusiasm, and are, nevertheless, stilllistening to me now, you have probably felt my selection to have been sometimes almost perverse, and have wished Imight have stuck to soberer examples. I reply that I took these extremer examples as yielding the profounderinformation. To learn the secrets of any science, we go to expert specialists, even though they may be eccentricpersons, and not to commonplace pupils. We combine what they tell us with the rest of our wisdom, and form ourfinal judgment independently. Even so with religion. We who have pursued such radical expressions of it may now besure that we know its secrets as authentically as any one can know them who learns them from another; and we havenext to answer, each of us for himself, the practical question: what are the dangers in this element of life? and in whatproportion may it need to be restrained by other elements, to give the proper balance?But this question suggests another one which I will answer immediately and get it out of the way, for it has more thanonce already vexed us.1 Ought it to be assumed that in all men the mixture of religion with other elements should beidentical? Ought it, indeed, to be assumed that the lives of all men should show identical religious elements? In otherwords, is the existence of so many religious types and sects and creeds regrettable?To these questions I answer 'No' emphatically. And my reason is that I do not see how it is possible that creatures insuch different positions and with such different powers as human individuals are, should have exactly the samefunctions and the same duties. No two of us have identical difficulties, nor should we be expected to work outidentical solutions. Each, from his peculiar angle of observation, takes in a certain sphere of fact and trouble, whicheach must deal with in a unique manner. One of us must soften himself, another must1For example, on pages 128, 152, 304, above."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP437 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 44]Page 437harden himself; one must yield a point, another must stand firm,—in order the better to defend the position assignedhim. If an Emerson were forced to be a Wesley, or a Moody forced to be a Whitman, the total human consciousnessof the divine would suffer. The divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by beingchampions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions. Each attitude being a syllable inhuman nature's total message, it takes the whole of us to spell the meaning out completely. So a 'god of battles' mustbe allowed to be the god for one kind of person, a god of peace and heaven and home, the god for another. We mustfrankly recognize the fact that we live in partial systems, and that parts are not interchangeable in the spiritual life. Ifwe are peevish and jealous, destruction of the self must be an element of our religion; why need it be one if we aregood and sympathetic from the outset? If we are sick souls, we require a religion of deliverance; but why think somuch of deliverance, if we are healthy-minded?1 Unquestionably, some men have the completer experience and thehigher vocation, here just as in the social world; but1From this point of view, the contrasts between the healthy and the morbid mind, and between the once-born and the twice-born types, ofwhich I spoke in earlier lectures (see pp. 151 156), cease to be the radical antagonisms which many think them. The twice-born lookdown upon the rectilinear consciousness of life of the once-born as being 'mere morality,' and not properly religion. \"Dr. Channing,\" anorthodox minister is reported to have said, \"is excluded from the highest form of religious life by the extraordinary rectitude of hischaracter.\" It is indeed true that the outlook upon life of the twiceborn—holding as it does more of the element of evil in solution—is thewider and completer. The 'heroic' or 'solemn' way in which life comes to them is a 'higher synthesis' into which healthy-mindedness andmorbidness both enter and combine. Evil is not evaded, but sublated in the higher religious cheer of these persons (see pp. 49 54,328 331). But the final consciousness which each type reaches of union with the divine has the same practical significance for theindividual; and individuals may well be allowed to get to it by the channels which lie most open to their several temperaments. In thecases which were quoted in Lecture IV, of the mind-cure form of healthy-mindedness, we found abundant examples of regenerativeprocess. The severity of the crisis in this process is a matter of degree. How long one shall continue to drink the consciousness of evil,and when one shall begin to short-circuit and get rid of it, are also matters of amount and degree, so that in many instances it is quitearbitrary whether we class the individual as a once-born or a twice-born subject."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP438 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 45]Page 438for each man to stay in his own experience, whate'er it be, and for others to tolerate him there, is surely best.But, you may now ask, would not this one-sidedness be cured if we should all espouse the science of religions as ourown religion? In answering this question I must open again the general relations of the theoretic to the active life.Knowledge about a thing is not the thing itself. You remember what Al-Ghazzali told us in the Lecture on Mysticism,—that to understand the causes of drunkenness, as a physician understands them, is not to be drunk. A science mightcome to understand everything about the causes and elements of religion, and might even decide which elements werequalified, by their general harmony with other branches of knowledge, to be considered true; and yet the best man atthis science might be the man who found it hardest to be personally devout. Tout savoir c'est tout pardonner. Thename of Renan would doubtless occur to many persons as an example of the way in which breadth of knowledge maymake one only a dilettante in possibilities, and blunt the acuteness of one's living faith.1 If religion be a function bywhich either God's cause or man's cause is to be really advanced, then he who lives the life of it, however narrowly, isa better servant than he who merely knows about it, however much. Knowledge about life is one thing; effectiveoccupation of a place in life, with its dynamic currents passing through your being, is another.For this reason, the science of religions may not be an equivalent for living religion; and if we turn to the innerdifficulties of such a science, we see that a point comes when she must drop the purely theoretic attitude, and either lether knots remain uncut, or have them cut by active faith. To see this, suppose that we have our science of religionsconstituted as a matter of fact. Suppose that she has assimilated all the necessary historical material and distilled outof it as its essence the same conclusions which I myself a few moments ago pronounced. Suppose that she agrees thatreligion, wherever it is an active thing, involves a belief in ideal presences,1Compare, e. g., the quotation from Renan on p. 40, above."},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP439 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 51]Page 439and a belief that in our prayerful communion with them,1 work is done, and something real comes to pass. She hasnow to exert her critical activity, and to decide how far, in the light of other sciences and in that of generalphilosophy, such beliefs can be considered true.Dogmatically to decide this is an impossible task. Not only are the other sciences and the philosophy still far frombeing completed, but in their present state we find them full of conflicts. The sciences of nature know nothing ofspiritual presences, and on the whole hold no practical commerce whatever with the idealistic conceptions towardswhich general philosophy inclines. The scientist, so-called, is, during his scientific hours at least, so materialistic thatone may well say that on the whole the influence of science goes against the notion that religion should be recognizedat all. And this antipathy to religion finds an echo within the very science of religions itself. The cultivator of thisscience has to become acquainted with so many groveling and horrible superstitions that a presumption easily arises inhis mind that any belief that is religious probably is false. In the 'prayerful communion' of savages with such mumbo-jumbos of deities as they acknowledge, it is hard for us to see what genuine spiritual work—even though it were workrelative only to their dark savage obligations—can possibly be done.The consequence is that the conclusions of the science of religions are as likely to be adverse as they are to befavorable to the claim that the essence of religion is true. There is a notion in the air about us that religion is probablyonly an anachronism, a case of 'survival,' an atavistic relapse into a mode of thought which humanity in its moreenlightened examples has outgrown; and this notion our religious anthropologists at present do little to counteract.This view is so widespread at the present day that I must consider it with some explicitness before I pass to my ownconclusions. Let me call it the 'Survival theory,' for brevity's sake.The pivot round which the religious life, as we have traced it, revolves, is the interest of the individual in his private1'Prayerful' taken in the broader sense explained above on pp. 415 ff."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP440 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 52]Page 440personal destiny. Religion, in short, is a monumental chapter in the history of human egotism. The gods believed in—whether by crude savages or by men disciplined intellectually—agree with each other in recognizing personal calls.Religious thought is carried on in terms of personality, this being, in the world of religion, the one fundamental fact.Today, quite as much as at any previous age, the religious individual tells you that the divine meets him on the basis ofhis personal concerns.Science, on the other hand, has ended by utterly repudiating the personal point of view. She catalogues her elementsand records her laws indifferent as to what purpose may be shown forth by them, and constructs her theories quitecareless of their bearing on human anxieties and fates. Though the scientist may individually nourish a religion, andbe a theist in his irresponsible hours, the days are over when it could be said that for Science herself the heavensdeclare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork. Our solar system, with its harmonies, is seen nowas but one passing case of a certain sort of moving equilibrium in the heavens, realized by a local accident in anappalling wilderness of worlds where no life can exist. In a span of time which as a cosmic interval will count but asan hour, it will have ceased to be. The Darwinian notion of chance production, and subsequent destruction, speedy ordeferred, applies to the largest as well as to the smallest facts. It is impossible, in the present temper of the scientificimagination, to find in the driftings of the cosmic atoms, whether they work on the universal or on the particular scale,anything but a kind of aimless weather, doing and undoing, achieving no proper history, and leaving no result. Naturehas no one distinguishable ultimate tendency with which it is possible to feel a sympathy. In the vast rhythm of herprocesses, as the scientific mind now follows them, she appears to cancel herself. The books of natural theology whichsatisfied the intellects of our grandfathers seem to us quite grotesque,1 representing, as they did, a God who1How was it ever conceivable, we ask, that a man like Christian Wolff, in whose dry-as-dust head all the learning of the early eighteenthcentury was concentrated, should have preserved such a baby-like faith in the personal and human character of Nature as to expound heroperations as he did in his(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP441 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 54]Page 441conformed the largest things of nature to the paltriest of our private wants. The God whom science recognizes must bea God of universal laws exclusively, a God who does a wholesale, not a retail business. He cannot accommodate hisprocesses to the convenience of individuals. The bubbles on the foam which coats a stormy sea are floating episodes,made and unmade by the forces of the wind and water. Our private(Footnote continued from previous page)work on the uses of natural things? This, for example, is the account he gives of the sun and its utility:—\"We see that God has created the sun to keep the changeable conditions on the earth in such an order that living creatures, men and beasts,may inhabit its surface. Since men are the most reasonable of creatures, and able to infer God's invisible being from the contemplation of theworld, the sun is so far forth contributes to the primary purpose of creation: without it the race of man could not be preserved or continued. The sun makes daylight, not only on our earth, but also on the other planets; and daylight is of the utmost utility to us; for by its means wecan commodiously carry on those occupations which in the night-time would either be quite impossible, or at any rate impossible without ourgoing to the expense of artificial light. The beasts of the field can find food by day which they would not be able to find at night. Moreoverwe owe it to the sunlight that we are able to see everything that is on the earth's surface, not only near by, but also at a distance, and torecognize both near and far things according to their species, which again is of manifold use to us not only in the business necessary tohuman life, and when we are traveling, but also for the scientific knowledge of Nature, which knowledge for the most part depends onobservations made with the help of sight, and, without the sunshine, would have been impossible. If any one would rightly impress on hismind the great advantages which he derives from the sun, let him imagine himself living through only one month, and see how it would bewith all his undertakings, if it were not day but night. He would then be sufficiently convinced out of his own experience, especially if he hadmuch work to carry on in the street or in the fields. From the sun we learn to recognize when it is midday, and by knowing this point of timeexactly, we can set our clocks right, on which account astronomy owes much to the sun. By help of the sun one can find the meridian. Butthe meridian is the basis of our sun-dials, and generally speaking, we should have no sun-dials if we had no sun.\" Vernünftige Gedanken vonden Absichten der natürlichen Dinge, 1782, pp. 74 84.Or read the account of God's beneficence in the institution of \"the great variety throughout the world of men's faces, voices, andhandwriting,\" given in Derham's Physico-theology, a book that had much vogue in the eighteenth century. \"Had Man's body,\" says Dr.Derham, ''been made according to any of the Atheistical Schemes, or any other Method than that of the infinite Lord of the World, this wiseVariety would never have been: but(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP442 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 55]Page 442selves are like those bubbles,—epiphenomena, as Clifford, I believe, ingeniously called them; their destinies weightnothing and determine nothing in the world's irremediable currents of events.(Footnote continued from previous page)Men's Faces would have been cast in the same, or not a very different Mould, their Organs of Speech would have sounded the same ornot so great a Variety of Notes; and the same Structure of Muscles and Nerves would have given the Hand the same Direction in Writing.And in this Case, what Confusion, what Disturbance, what Mischiefs would the world eternally have lain under! No Security could havebeen to our persons; no Certainty, no Enjoyment of our Possessions; no Justice between Man and Man; no Distinction between Good andBad, between Friends and Foes, between Father and Child, Husband and Wife, Male or Female; but all would have been turned topsy-turvy, by being exposed to the Malice of the Envious and ill-Natured, to the Fraud and Violence of Knaves and Robbers, to the Forgeriesof the crafty Cheat, to the Lusts of the Effeminate and Debauched, and what not! Our Courts of Justice can abundantly testify the direEffects of Mistaking Men's Faces, of counterfeiting their Hands, and forging Writings. But now as the infinitely wise Creator and Rulerhath ordered the Matter, every man's Face can distinguish him in the Light, and his Voice in the Dark; his Handwriting can speak forhim though absent, and be his Witness, and secure his Contracts in future Generations. A manifest as well as admirable Indication of thedivine Superintendence and Management.\"A God so careful as to make provision even for the unmistakable signing of bank checks and deeds was a deity truly after the heart ofeighteenth century Anglicanism.I subjoin, omitting the capitals, Derham's 'Vindication of God by the Institution of Hills and Valleys,' and Wolff's altogether culinary accountof the institution of Water:—\"The uses,\" says Wolff, \"which water serves in human life are plain to see and need not be described at length. Water is a universal drink ofman and beasts. Even though men have made themselves drinks that are artificial, they could not do this without water. Beer is brewed ofwater and malt, and it is the water in it which quenches thirst. Wine is prepared from grapes, which could never have grown without the helpof water; and the same is true of those drinks which in England and other places they produce from fruit. Therefore since God so plannedthe world that men and beasts should live upon it and find there everything required for their necessity and convenience, he also made wateras one means whereby to make the earth into so excellent a dwelling. And this is all the more manifest when we consider the advantageswhich we obtain from this same water for the cleaning of our household utensils, of our clothing, and of other matters. When one goes into agrinding-mill one sees that the grindstone must always be kept wet and then one will get a still greater idea of the use of water.\"Of the hills and valleys, Derham, after praising their beauty, discourses as(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP443 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 56]Page 443You see how natural it is, from this point of view, to treat religion as a mere survival, for religion does in factperpetuate the traditions of the most primeval thought. To coerce the spiritual powers, or to square them and get themon our side, was, during enormous tracts of time, the one great object in our dealings with the natural world. For ourancestors, dreams, hallucinations, revelations, and cock-and-bull stories were inextricably mixed with facts. Up to acomparatively recent date such distinctions as those between what has been verified and what is only conjectured,between the impersonal and the personal aspects of existence, were hardly suspected(Footnote continued from previous page)follows: \"Some constitutions are indeed of so happy a strength, and so confirmed an health, as to be indifferent to almost any place ortemperature of the air. But then others are so weakly and feeble, as not to be able to bear one, but can live comfortably in another place.With some the more subtle and finer air of the hills doth best agree, who are languishing and dying in the feculent and grosser air of greattowns, or even the warmer and vaporous air of the valleys and waters. But contrariwise, others languish on the hills, and grow lusty andstrong in the warmer air of the valleys.\"So that this opportunity of shifting our abode from the hills to the vales, is an admirable easement, refreshment, and great benefit to thevaletudinarian, feeble part of mankind; affording those an easy and comfortable life, who would otherwise live miserably, languish, and pineaway.\"To this salutary conformation of the earth we may add another great convenience of the hills, and that is affording commodious places forhabitation, serving (as an eminent author wordeth it) as screens to keep off the cold and nipping blasts of the northern and easterly winds, andreflecting the benign and cherishing sunbeams, and so rendering our habitations both more comfortable and more cheerly in winter.\"Lastly, it is to the hills that the fountains owe their rise and the rivers their conveyance, and consequently those vast masses and lofty pilesare not, as they are charged, such rude and useless excrescences of our ill-formed globe; but the admirable tools of nature, contrived andordered by the infinite Creator, to do one of its most useful works. For, was the surface of the earth even and level, and the middle parts of itsislands and continents not mountainous and high as now it is, it is most certain there could be no descent for the rivers, no conveyance for thewaters; but, instead of gliding along those gentle declivities which the higher lands now afford them quite down to the sea, they wouldstagnate and perhaps stink, and also drown large tracts of land.\"[Thus] the hills and vales, though to a peevish and weary traveler they may seem incommodious and troublesome, yet are a noble work ofthe great Creator, and wisely appointed by him for the good of our sublunary world.\""},{"pageNumber":458,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP444 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 57]Page 444or conceived. Whatever you imagined in a lively manner, whatever you thought fit to be true, you affirmedconfidently; and whatever you affirmed, your comrades believed. Truth was what had not yet been contradicted, mostthings were taken into the mind from the point of view of their human suggestiveness, and the attention confined itselfexclusively to the æsthetic and dramatic aspects of events.1How indeed could it be otherwise? The extraordinary1Until the seventeenth century this mode of thought prevailed. One need only recall the dramatic treatment even of mechanical questionsby Aristotle, as, for example, his explanation of the power of the lever to make a small weight raise a larger one. This is due, accordingto Aristotle, to the generally miraculous character of the circle and of all circular movement. The circle is both convex and concave; it ismade by a fixed point and a moving line, which contradict each other; and whatever moves in a circle moves in opposite directions.Nevertheless, movement in a circle is the most 'natural' movement; and the long arm of the lever, moving, as it does, in the larger circle,has the greater amount of this natural motion, and consequently requires the lesser force. Or recall the explanation by Herodotus of theposition of the sun in winter: It moves to the south because of the cold which drives it into the warm parts of the heavens over Libya. Orlisten to Saint Augustine's speculations: \"Who gave to chaff such power to freeze that it preserves snow buried under it, and such powerto warm that it ripens green fruit? Who can explain the strange properties of fire itself, which blackens all that it burns, though itselfbright, and which, though of the most beautiful colors, discolors almost all that it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel intogrimy cinders? Then what wonderful properties do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light tap breaks it, and a slight pressurepulverizes it, and yet is so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to decay.\" City of God, book xxi. ch. iv.Such aspects of things as these, their naturalness and unnaturalness, the sympathies and antipathies of their superficial qualities, theireccentricities, their brightness and strength and destructiveness, were inevitably the ways in which they originally fastened our attention.If you open early medical books, you will find sympathetic magic invoked on every page. Take, for example, the famous vulnerary ointmentattributed to Paracelsus. For this there were a variety of receipts, including usually human fat, the fat of either a bull, a wild boar, or a bear;powdered earthworms, the usnia, or mossy growth on the weathered skull of a hanged criminal, and other materials equally unpleasant—thewhole prepared under the planet Venus if possible, but never under Mars or Saturn. Then, if a splinter of wood, dipped in the patient's blood,or the bloodstained weapon that wounded him, be immersed in this ointment, the wound itself being tightly bound up, the latter infallibly getswell,—I quote now Van Helmont's account,—for the blood on the weapon or splinter, containing in it the spirit of the wounded man, isroused to active excitement by the contact of the(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP445 hl[01 03 2011 00 35 58]Page 445value, for explanation and prevision, of those mathematical and mechanical modes of conception which science uses,was a result that could not possibly have been expected in advance. Weight, movement, velocity, direction, position,what(Footnote continued from previous page)ointment, whence there results to it a full commission or power to cure its cousin-german, the blood in the patient's body. This it does bysucking out the dolorous and exotic impression from the wounded part. But to do this it has to implore the aid of the bull's fat, and otherportions of the unguent. The reason why bull's fat is so powerful is that the bull at the time of slaughter is full of secret reluctancy andvindictive murmurs, and therefore dies with a higher flame of revenge about him than any other animal. And thus we have made it out,says this author, that the admirable efficacy of the ointment ought to be imputed, not to any auxiliary concurrence of Satan, but simply tothe energy of the posthumous character of Revenge remaining firmly impressed upon the blood and concreted fat in the unguent. J. B.VAN HELMONT: A Ternary of Paradoxes, translated by WALTER CHARLETON, London, 1650.—I much abridge the original in mycitations.The author goes on to prove by the analogy of many other natural facts that this sympathetic action between things at a distance is the truerationale of the case. \"If,\" he says, \"the heart of a horse, slain by a witch, taken out of the yet reeking carcase, be impaled upon an arrow androasted, immediately the whole witch becomes tormented with the insufferable pains and cruelty of the fire, which could by no means happenunless there preceded a conjunction of the spirit of the witch with the spirit of the horse. In the reeking and yet panting heart, the spirit of thewitch is kept captive, and the retreat of it prevented by the arrow transfixed. Similarly hath not many a murdered carcase at the coroner'sinquest suffered a fresh hæmorrhage or cruentation at the presence of the assassin?—the blood being, as in a furious fit of anger, enraged andagitated by the impress of revenge conceived against the murderer, at the instant of the soul's compulsive exile from the body. So, if you havedropsy, gout, or jaundice, by including some of your warm blood in the shell and white of an egg, which, exposed to a gentle heat, and mixedwith a bait of flesh, you shall give to a hungry dog or hog, the disease shall instantly pass from you into the animal, and leave you entirely.And similarly again, if you burn some of the milk either of a cow or of a woman, the gland from which it issued will dry up. A gentleman atBrussels had his nose mowed off in a combat, but the celebrated surgeon Tagliacozzus digged a new nose for him out of the skin of the armof a porter at Bologna. About thirteen months after his return to his own country, the engrafted nose grew cold, putrefied, and in a few daysdropped off, and it was then discovered that the porter had expired, near about the same punctilio of time. There are still at Brussels eye-witnesses of this occurrence,\" says Van Helmont; and adds, \"I pray what is there in this of superstition or of exalted imagination?\"Modern mind-cure literature—the works of Prentice Mulford, for example—is full of sympathetic magic."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP446 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 09]Page 446thin, pallid, uninteresting ideas! How could the richer animistic aspects of Nature, the peculiarities and oddities thatmake phenomena picturesquely striking or expressive, fail to have been first singled out and followed by philosophyas the more promising avenue to the knowledge of Nature's life? Well, it is still in these richer animistic and dramaticaspects that religion delights to dwell. It is the terror and beauty of phenomena, the 'promise' of the dawn and of therainbow, the 'voice' of the thunder, the 'gentleness' of the summer rain, the 'sublimity' of the stars, and not the physicallaws which these things follow, by which the religious mind still continues to be most impressed; and just as of yore,the devout man tells you that in the solitude of his room or of the fields he still feels the divine presence, thatinflowings of help come in reply to his prayers, and that sacrifices to this unseen reality fill him with security andpeace.Pure anachronism! says the survival-theory;—anachronism for which deanthropomorphization of the imagination isthe remedy required. The less we mix the private with the cosmic, the more we dwell in universal and impersonalterms, the truer heirs of Science we become.In spite of the appeal which this impersonality of the scientific attitude makes to a certain magnanimity of temper, Ibelieve it to be shallow, and I can now state my reason in comparatively few words. That reason is that, so long as wedeal with the cosmic and the general, we deal only with the symbols of reality, but as soon as we deal with privateand personal phenomena as such, we deal with realities in the completest sense of the term. I think I can easily makeclear what I mean by these words.The world of our experience consists at all times of two parts, an objective and a subjective part, of which the formermay be incalculably more extensive than the latter, and yet the latter can never be omitted or suppressed. Theobjective part is the sum total of whatsoever at any given time we may be thinking of, the subjective part is the inner'state' in which the thinking comes to pass. What we think of may be enormous,—the cosmic times and spaces, forexample,—whereas the inner state may be the most fugitive and paltry activity of"},{"pageNumber":461,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP447 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 10]Page 447mind. Yet the cosmic objects, so far as the experience yields them, are but ideal pictures of something whoseexistence we do not inwardly possess but only point at outwardly, while the inner state is our very experience itself;its reality and that of our experience are one. A conscious field plus its object as felt or thought of plus an attitudetowards the object plus the sense of a self to whom the attitude belongs—such a concrete bit of personal experiencemay be a small bit, but it is a solid bit as long as it lasts; not hollow, not a mere abstract element of experience, suchas the 'object' is when taken all alone. It is a full fact, even though it be an insignificant fact; it is of the kind to whichall realities whatsoever must belong; the motor currents of the world run through the like of it; it is on the lineconnecting real events with real events. That unsharable feeling which each one of us has of the pinch of hisindividual destiny as he privately feels it rolling out on fortune's wheel may be disparaged for its egotism, may besneered at as unscientific, but it is the one thing that fills up the measure of our concrete actuality, and any would-beexistent that should lack such a feeling, or its analogue, would be a piece of reality only half made up.1If this be true, it is absurd for science to say that the egotistic elements of experience should be suppressed. The axisof reality runs solely through the egotistic places,—they are strung upon it like so many beads. To describe the worldwith all the various feelings of the individual pinch of destiny, all the various spiritual attitudes, left out from thedescription—they being as describable as anything else—would be something like offering a printed bill of fare as theequivalent for a solid meal. Religion makes no such blunder. The individual's religion may be egotistic, and thoseprivate realities which it keeps in touch with may be narrow enough; but at any rate it always remains infinitely lesshollow and abstract, as far as it goes, than a science which prides itself on taking no account of anything private at all.A bill of fare with one real raisin on it instead of the word1Compare Lotze's doctrine that the only meaning we can attach to the notion of a thing as it is 'in itself' is by conceiving it as it is foritself; i. e., as a piece of full experience with a private sense of 'pinch' or inner activity of some sort going with it."},{"pageNumber":462,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP448 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 12]Page 448'raisin,' with one real egg instead of the word 'egg,' might be an inadequate meal, but it would at least be acommencement of reality. The contention of the survival-theory that we ought to stick to non-personal elementsexclusively seems like saying that we ought to be satisfied forever with reading the naked bill of fare. I think,therefore, that however particular questions connected with our individual destinies may be answered, it is only byacknowledging them as genuine questions, and living in the sphere of thought which they open up, that we becomeprofound. But to live thus is to be religious; so I unhesitatingly repudiate the survival-theory of religion, as beingfounded on an egregious mistake. It does not follow, because our ancestors made so many errors of fact and mixedthem with their religion, that we should therefore leave off being religious at all.1 By being religious we establishourselves in possession of ultimate reality at the only points at which reality is given us to guard. Our responsibleconcern is with our private destiny, after all.You see now why I have been so individualistic throughout these lectures, and why I have seemed so bent onrehabilitating the element of feeling in religion and subordinating its intellectual part. Individuality is founded infeeling; and the recesses of feeling, the darker, blinder strata of character, are the only places in the world in which wecatch real fact in the1Even the errors of fact may possibly turn out not to be as wholesale as the scientist assumes. We saw in Lecture IV how the religiousconception of the universe seems to many mind-curers 'verified' from day to day by their experience of fact. 'Experience of fact' is a fieldwith so many things in it that the sectarian scientist, methodically declining, as he does, to recognize such 'facts' as mind-curers andothers like them experience, otherwise than by such rude heads of classification as 'bosh,' 'rot,' 'folly,' certainly leaves out a mass of rawfact which, save for the industrious interest of the religious in the more personal aspects of reality, would never have succeeded ingetting itself recorded at all. We know this to be true already in certain cases; it may, therefore, be true in others as well. Miraculoushealings have always been part of the supernaturalist stock in trade, and have always been dismissed by the scientist as figments of theimagination. But the scientist's tardy education in the facts of hypnotism has recently given him an apperceiving mass for phenomena ofthis order, and he consequently now allows that the healings may exist, provided you expressly call them effects of 'suggestion.' Even thestigmata of the cross on Saint Francis's hands and feet may on these terms not be a fable. Similarly, the time-honored phenomenon ofdiabolical(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP449 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 13]Page 449making, and directly perceive how events happen, and how work is actually done.1 Compared with this world ofliving individualized feelings, the world of generalized objects which the intellect contemplates is without solidity orlife. As in stereoscopic or kinetoscopic pictures seen outside the instrument, the third dimension, the movement, thevital element, are not there. We get a beautiful picture of an express train supposed to be moving, but where in thepicture, as I have heard a friend say, is the energy or the fifty miles an hour?2Let us agree, then, that Religion, occupying herself with personal destinies and keeping thus in contact with the onlyabsolute realities which we know, must necessarily play an eternal part in human history. The next thing to decide is(Footnote continued from previous page)possession is on the point of being admitted by the scientist as a fact, now that he has the name of 'hystero-demonopathy' by which toapperceive it. No one can foresee just how far this legitimation of occultist phenomena under newly found scientist titles may proceed—even 'prophecy,' even 'levitation,' might creep into the pale.Thus the divorce between scientist facts and religious facts may not necessarily be as eternal as it at first sight seems, nor the personalism andromanticism of the world, as they appeared to primitive thinking, be matters so irrevocably outgrown. The final human opinion may, in short,in some manner now impossible to foresee, revert to the more personal style, just as any path of progress may follow a spiral rather than astraight line. If this were so, the rigorously impersonal view of science might one day appear as having been a temporarily useful eccentricityrather than the definitively triumphant position which the sectarian scientist at present so confidently announces it to be.1Hume's criticism has banished causation from the world of physical objects, and 'Science' is absolutely satisfied to define cause in terms ofconcomitant change—read Mach, Pearson, Ostwald. The 'original' of the notion of causation is in our inner personal experience, and onlythere can causes in the old-fashioned sense be directly observed and described.2When I read in a religious paper words like these: \"Perhaps the best thing we can say of God is that he is the Inevitable Inference,\" Irecognize the tendency to let religion evaporate in intellectual terms. Would martyrs have sung in the flames for a mere inference, howeverinevitable it might be? Original religious men, like Saint Francis, Luther, Behmen, have usually been enemies of the intellect's pretension tomeddle with religious things. Yet the intellect, everywhere invasive, shows everywhere its shallowing effect. See how the ancient spirit ofMethodism evaporates under those wonderfully able rationalistic booklets (which every one should read) of a philosopher like ProfessorBowne (The Christian Revelation, The Christian Life, The Atone-(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP450 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 14]Page 450what she reveals about those destinies, or whether indeed she reveals anything distinct enough to be considered ageneral message to mankind. We have done as you see, with our preliminaries, and our final summing up can nowbegin.I am well aware that after all the palpitating documents which I have quoted, and all the perspectives of emotion-in-spiring institution and belief that my previous lectures have opened, the dry analysis to which I now advance mayappear to many of you like an anticlimax, a tapering-off and flattening out of the subject, instead of a crescendo ofinterest and result. I said awhile ago that the religious attitude of Protestants appears poverty-stricken to the Catholicimagination. Still more poverty-stricken, I fear, may my final summing up of the subject appear at first to some ofyou. On which account I pray you now to bear this point in mind, that in the present part of it I am expressly trying toreduce religion to its lowest admissible terms, to that minimum, free from(Footnote continued from previous page)ment: Cincinnati and New York, 1898, 1899, 1900). See the positively expulsive purpose of philosophy properly so called:—\"Religion,\" writes M. Vacherot (La Religion, Paris, 1869, pp. 313, 436, et passim), \"answers to a transient state or condition, not to apermanent determination of human nature, being merely an expression of that stage of the human mind which is dominated by theimagination. Christianity has but a single possible final heir to its estate, and that is scientific philosophy.\"In a still more radical vein, Professor Ribot (Psychologie des Sentiments, p. 310) describes the evaporation of religion. He sums it up in asingle formula—the ever-growing predominance of the rational intellectual element, with the gradual fading out of the emotional element,this latter tending to enter into the group of purely intellectual sentiments. \"Of religious sentiment properly so called, nothing survives at lastsave a vague respect for the unknowable x which is a last relic of the fear, and a certain attraction towards the ideal, which is a relic of thelove, that characterized the earlier periods of religious growth. To state this more simply, religion tends to turn into religious philosophy.—These are psychologically entirely different things, the one being a theoretic construction of ratiocination, whereas the other is the living workof a group of persons, or of a great inspired leader, calling into play the entire thinking and feeling organism of man.\"I find the same failure to recognize that the stronghold of religion lies in individuality in attempts like those of Professor Baldwin (MentalDevelopment, Social and Ethical Interpretations, ch. x.) and Mr. H. R. Marshall (Instinct and Reason, chaps. viii. to xii.) to make it a purely'conservative social force.'"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP451 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 15]Page 451individualistic excrescences, which all religions contain as their nucleus, and on which it may be hoped that allreligious persons may agree. That established, we should have a result which might be small, but would at least besolid; and on it and round it the ruddier additional beliefs on which the different individuals make their venture mightbe grafted, and flourish as richly as you please. I shall add my own over-belief (which will be, I confess, of asomewhat pallid kind, as befits a critical philosopher), and you will, I hope, also add your over-beliefs, and we shallsoon be in the varied world of concrete religious constructions once more. For the moment, let me dryly pursue theanalytic part of the task.Both thought and feeling are determinants of conduct, and the same conduct may be determined either by feeling orby thought. When we survey the whole field of religion, we find a great variety in the thoughts that have prevailedthere; but the feelings on the one hand and the conduct on the other are almost always the same, for Stoic, Christian,and Buddhist saints are practically indistinguishable in their lives. The theories which Religion generates, being thusvariable, are secondary; and if you wish to grasp her essence, you must look to the feelings and the conduct as beingthe more constant elements. It is between these two elements that the short circuit exists on which she carries on herprincipal business, while the ideas and symbols and other institutions form loop-lines which may be perfections andimprovements, and may even some day all be united into one harmonious system, but which are not to be regarded asorgans with an indispensable function, necessary at all times for religious life to go on. This seems to me the firstconclusion which we are entitled to draw from the phenomena we have passed in review.The next step is to characterize the feelings. To what psychological order do they belong?The resultant outcome of them is in any case what Kant calls a 'sthenic' affection, an excitement of the cheerful,expansive, 'dynamogenic' order which, like any tonic, freshens our vital powers. In almost every lecture, but especiallyin the lectures on Conversion and on Saintliness, we have seen how this emotion overcomes temperamentalmelancholy and imparts endurance to the Subject, or a zest, or a meaning, or an"},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP452 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 16]Page 452enchantment and glory to the common objects of life.1 The name of 'faith-state,' by which Professor Leuba designatesit, is a good one.2 It is a biological as well as a psychological condition, and Tolstoy is absolutely accurate in classingfaith among the forces by which men live.3 The total absence of it, anhedonia,4 means collapse.The faith-state may hold a very minimum of intellectual content. We saw examples of this in those sudden raptures ofthe divine presence, or in such mystical seizures as Dr. Bucke described.5 It may be a mere vague enthusiasm, halfspiritual, half vital, a courage, and a feeling that great and wondrous things are in the air.6When, however, a positive intellectual content is associated1Compare, for instance, pages 189, 202, 206, 209, 229 to 236, 252 to 255.2American Journal of Psychology, vii. 345.3Above, p. 171.4Above, p. 136.5Above, p. 360.6Example: Henri Perreyve writes to Gratry: ''I do not know how to deal with the happiness which you aroused in me this morning. Itoverwhelms me; I want to do something, yet I can do nothing and am fit for nothing. I would fain do great things.\" Again, after an inspiringinterview, he writes: \"I went homewards, intoxicated with joy, hope, and strength. I wanted to feed upon my happiness in solitude, far fromall men. It was late; but, unheeding that, I took a mountain path and went on like a madman, looking at the heavens, regardless of earth.Suddenly an instinct made me draw hastily back—I was on the very edge of a precipice, one step more and I must have fallen. I took frightand gave up my nocturnal promenade.\" A. GRATRY: Henri Perreyve, London, 1872, pp. 92, 89.This primacy, in the faith-state, of vague expansive impulse over direction is well expressed in Walt Whitman's lines (Leaves of Grass, 1872,p. 190):—\"O to confront night, storms, hunger, ridicule, accidents, rebuffs, as thetrees and animals do. Dear Camerado! I confess I have urged you onward with me, and stillurge you, without the least idea what is our destination,Or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quell'd and defeated.\"This readiness for great things, and this sense that the world by its importance, wonderfulness, etc., is apt for their production, would seem tobe the undifferentiated germ of all the higher faiths. Trust in our own dreams of ambition, or in our country's expansive destinies, and faith inthe providence of God, all have their source in that onrush of our sanguine impulses, and in that sense of the exceedingness of the possibleover the real."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP453 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 17]Page 453with a faith-state, it gets invincibly stamped in upon belief,1 and this explains the passionate loyalty of religiouspersons everywhere to the minutest details of their so widely differing creeds. Taking creeds and faith-state together,as forming 'religions,' and treating these as purely subjective phenomena, without regard to the question of their 'truth,'we are obliged, on account of their extraordinary influence upon action and endurance, to class them amongst themost important biological functions of mankind. Their stimulant and anæsthetic effect is so great that Professor Leuba,in a recent article,2 goes so far as to say that so long as men can use their God, they care very little who he is, or evenwhether he is at all. \"The truth of the matter can be put,\" says Leuba, \"in this way: God is not known, he is notunderstood; he is used—sometimes as meat-purveyor, sometimes as moral support, sometimes as friend, sometimesas an object of love. If he proves himself useful, the religious consciousness asks for no more than that. Does Godreally exist? How does he exist? What is he? are so many irrelevant questions. Not God, but life, more life, a larger,richer, more satisfying life, is, in the last analysis, the end of religion. The love of life, at any and every level ofdevelopment, is the religious impulse.\"3At this purely subjective rating, therefore, Religion must be considered vindicated in a certain way from the attacks ofher critics. It would seem that she cannot be a mere anachronism and survival, but must exert a permanent function,whether she be with or without intellectual content, and whether, if she have any, it be true or false.1Compare LEUBA: Loc. cit., pp. 346 349.2The Contents of Religious Consciousness, in The Monist, xi. 536, July, 1901.3Loc. cit., pp. 571, 572, abridged. See, also, this writer's extraordinarily true criticism of the notion that religion primarily seeks to solve theintellectual mystery of the world. Compare what W. BENDER says (in his Wesen der Religion, Bonn, 1888, pp. 85, 38): \"Not the questionabout God, and not the inquiry into the origin and purpose of the world is religion, but the question about Man. All religious views of life areanthropocentric.\" \"Religion is that activity of the human impulse towards self-preservation by means of which Man seeks to carry hisessential vital purposes through against the adverse pressure of the world by raising himself freely towards the world's ordering andgoverning powers when the limits of his own strength are reached.\" The whole book is little more than a development of these words."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP454 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 18]Page 454We must next pass beyond the point of view of merely subjective utility, and make inquiry into the intellectualcontent itself.First, is there, under all the discrepancies of the creeds, a common nucleus to which they bear their testimonyunanimously?And second, ought we to consider the testimony true?I will take up the first question first, and answer it immediately in the affirmative. The warring gods and formulas ofthe various religions do indeed cancel each other, but there is a certain uniform deliverance in which religions allappear to meet. It consists of two parts:—1. An uneasiness; and2. Its solution.1. The uneasiness, reduced to its simplest terms, is a sense that there is something wrong about us as we naturallystand.2. The solution is a sense that we are saved from the wrongness by making proper connection with the higher powers.In those more developed minds which alone we are studying, the wrongness takes a moral character, and the salvationtakes a mystical tinge. I think we shall keep well within the limits of what is common to all such minds if weformulate the essence of their religious experience in terms like these:—The individual, so far as he suffers from his wrongness and criticises it, is to that extent consciously beyond it, and inat least possible touch with something higher, if anything higher exist. Along with the wrong part there is thus a betterpart of him, even though it may be but a most helpless germ. With which part he should identify his real being is byno means obvious at this stage; but when stage 2 (the stage of solution or salvation) arrives,1 the man identifies hisreal being with the germinal higher part of himself; and does so in the following way. He becomes conscious that thishigher part is conterminous and continuous with a MORE of the same quality, which is operative in the universeoutside of him, and which he can keep in working touch with, and in a fashion get on board of and save himself whenall his lower being has gone to pieces in the wreck.1Remember that for some men it arrives suddenly, for others gradually, whilst others again practically enjoy it all their life."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP455 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 20]Page 455It seems to me that all the phenomena are accurately describable in these very simple general terms.1 They allow forthe divided self and the struggle; they involve the change of personal centre and the surrender of the lower self; theyexpress the appearance of exteriority of the helping power and yet account for our sense of union with it;2 and theyfully justify our feelings of security and joy. There is probably no autobiographic document, among all those which Ihave quoted, to which the description will not well apply. One need only add such specific details as will adapt it tovarious theologies and various personal temperaments, and one will then have the various experiences reconstructedin their individual forms.So far, however, as this analysis goes, the experiences are only psychological phenomena. They possess, it is true,enormous biological worth. Spiritual strength really increases in the subject when he has them, a new life opens forhim, and they seem to him a place of conflux where the forces of two universes meet; and yet this may be nothing buthis subjective way of feeling things, a mood of his own fancy, in spite of the effects produced. I now turn to mysecond question: What is the objective 'truth' of their content?3The part of the content concerning which the question of truth most pertinently arises is that 'MORE of the samequality' with which our own higher self appears in the experience to come into harmonious working relation. Is such a'more' merely our own notion, or does it really exist? If so, in what shape does it exist? Does it act, as well as exist?And in what form should we conceive of that 'union' with it of which religious geniuses are so convinced?1The practical difficulties are: 1, to 'realize the reality' of one's higher part; 2, to identify one's self with it exclusively; and 3, to identifyit with all the rest of ideal being.2\"When mystical activity is at its height, we find consciousness possessed by the sense of a being at once excessive and identical with theself: great enough to be God; interior enough to be me. The 'objectivity' of it ought in that case to be called excessivity, rather, orexceedingness.\" RÉCÉJAC: Essai sur les fondements de la conscience mystique, 1897, p. 46.3The word 'truth' is here taken to mean something additional to bare value for life, although the natural propensity of man is to believe thatwhatever has great value for life is thereby certified as true."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP456 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 27]Page 456It is in answering these questions that the various theologies perform their theoretic work, and that their divergenciesmost come to light. They all agree that the 'more' really exists; though some of them hold it to exist in the shape of apersonal god or gods, while others are satisfied to conceive it as a stream of ideal tendency embedded in the eternalstructure of the world. They all agree, moreover, that it acts as well as exists, and that something really is effected forthe better when you throw your life into its hands. It is when they treat of the experience of 'union' with it that theirspeculative differences appear most clearly. Over this point pantheism and theism, nature and second birth, works andgrace and karma, immortality and reincarnation, rationalism and mysticism, carry on inveterate disputes.At the end of my lecture on Philosophy1 I held out the notion that an impartial science of religions might sift out fromthe midst of their discrepancies a common body of doctrine which she might also formulate in terms to whichphysical science need not object. This, I said, she might adopt as her own reconciling hypothesis, and recommend itfor general belief. I also said that in my last lecture I should have to try my own hand at framing such an hypothesis.The time has now come for this attempt. Who says 'hypothesis' renounces the ambition to be coercive in hisarguments. The most I can do is, accordingly, to offer something that may fit the facts so easily that your scientificlogic will find no plausible pretext for vetoing your impulse to welcome it as true.The 'more,' as we called it, and the meaning of our 'union' with it, form the nucleus of our inquiry. Into what definitedescription can these words be translated, and for what definite facts do they stand? It would never do for us to placeourselves offhand at the position of a particular theology, the Christian theology, for example, and proceedimmediately to define the 'more' as Jehovah, and the 'union' as his imputation to us of the righteousness of Christ.That would be unfair to other religions, and, from our present standpoint at least, would be an over-belief.1Above, p. 408."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP457 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 28]Page 457We must begin by using less particularized terms; and, since one of the duties of the science of religions is to keepreligion in connection with the rest of science, we shall do well to seek first of all a way of describing the 'more,'which psychologists may also recognize as real. The subconscious self is nowadays a well-accredited psychologicalentity; and I believe that in it we have exactly the mediating term required. Apart from all religious considerations,there is actually and literally more life in our total soul than we are at any time aware of. The exploration of thetransmarginal field has hardly yet been seriously undertaken, but what Mr. Myers said in 1892 in his essay on theSubliminal Consciousness1 is as true as when it was first written: \"Each of us is in reality an abiding psychical entityfar more extensive than he knows—an individuality which can never express itself completely through any corporealmanifestation. The Self manifests through the organism; but there is always some part of the Self unmanifested; andalways, as it seems, some power of organic expression in abeyance or reserve.\"2 Much of the content of this largerbackground against which our conscious being stands out in relief is insignificant. Imperfect memories, silly jingles,inhibitive timidities, 'dissolutive' phenomena of various sorts, as Myers calls them, enter into it for a large part. But init many of the performances of genius seem also to have their origin; and in our study of conversion, of mysticalexperiences, and of prayer, we have seen how striking a part invasions from this region play in the religious life.Let me then propose, as an hypothesis, that whatever it1Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, vol. vii. p. 305.

Compare also my paper: 'Frederic Myers's Services to Psychology,' in the saidProceedings, part xlii., May, 1901.2Compare the inventory given above on p. 433, and also what is said of the subconscious self on pp. 215 218, 221 222.—In a privatelyprinted syllabus which I receive from Mr. H.

Starting thus with a recognized psychological fact as ourbasis, we seem to preserve a contact with 'science' which the ordinary theologian lacks. At the same time thetheologian's contention that the religious man is moved by an external power is vindicated, for it is one of thepeculiarities of invasions from the subconscious region to take on objective appearances, and to suggest to the Subjectan external control. In the religious life the control is felt as 'higher'; but since on our hypothesis it is primarily thehigher faculties of our own hidden mind which are controlling, the sense of union with the power beyond us is a senseof something, not merely apparently, but literally true.This doorway into the subject seems to me the best one for a science of religions, for it mediates between a number ofdifferent points of view. Yet it is only a doorway, and difficulties present themselves as soon as we step through it,and ask how far our transmarginal consciousness carries us if we follow it on its remoter side. Here the over-beliefsbegin: here mysticism and the conversion-rapture and Vedantism and transcendental idealism bring in their monisticinterpretations1 and tell us that the finite self rejoins the absolute self, for it was always one with God and identicalwith the soul of the world.2 Here the prophets of all the different religions come with their visions, voices, raptures,and other1Compare above, pp. 378 ff.2One more expression of this belief, to increase the reader's familiarity with the notion of it:—\"If this room is full of darkness for thousands of years, and you come in and begin to weep and wail, 'Oh, the darkness,' will the darknessvanish? Bring the light in, strike a match, and light comes in a moment. So what good will it do you to think all your lives, 'Oh, I have doneevil, I have made many mistakes'? It requires no ghost to tell us that. Bring in the light, and the evil goes in a moment. Strengthen the realnature, build up yourselves, the effulgent, the resplendent, the ever pure, call that up in every one whom you see. I wish that every one of ushad come to such a state that even when we see the vilest of human beings we can see the God within, and instead of condemning, say, 'Rise,thou effulgent One, rise thou who art always pure, rise thou birthless and deathless, rise almighty, and manifest your nature.'

If we follow any one of them, or if we follow philosophical theory and embracemonistic pantheism on non-mystical grounds, we do so in the exercise of our individual freedom, and build out ourreligion in the way most congruous with our personal susceptibilities. Among these susceptibilities intellectual onesplay a decisive part. Although the religious question is primarily a question of life, of living or not living in the higherunion which opens itself to us as a gift, yet the spiritual excitement in which the gift appears a real one will often failto be aroused in an individual until certain particular intellectual beliefs or ideas which, as we say, come home to him,are touched.1 These ideas will thus be essential to that individual's religion;—(Footnote continued from previous page)prayer: remembering our nature.\" \"Why does man go out to look for a God?

Not to become pure, you are pure already. You are not to beperfect, you are that already. Every good thought which you think or act upon is simply tearing the veil, as it were, and the purity, theInfinity, the God behind, manifests itself—the eternal Subject of everything, the eternal Witness in this universe, your own Self.Knowledge is, as it were, a lower step, a degradation.

As I have elsewhere written,the most interesting and valuable things about a man are usually his over-beliefs.Disregarding the over-beliefs, and confining ourselves to what is common and generic, we have in the fact that theconscious person is continuous with a wider self through which saving experiences come,1 a positive content ofreligious experience which, it seems to me, is literally and objectively true as far as it goes. If I now proceed to statemy own hypothesis about the farther limits of this extension of our personality, I shall be offering my own over-belief—though I know it will appear a sorry under-belief to some of you—for which I can only bespeak the sameindulgence which in a converse case I should accord to yours.The further limits of our being plunge, it seems to me, into an altogether other dimension of existence from thesensible and merely 'understandable' world. Name it the mystical region, or the supernatural region, whichever youchoose. So far as our ideal impulses originate in this region (and most of them do originate in it, for we find thempossessing us in a way for which we cannot articulately account), we belong to it in a more intimate sense than that inwhich we belong to the visible world, for we belong in the most intimate sense wherever our ideals belong. Yet theunseen region in question is not merely ideal, for it produces effects in this world. When we commune with it, work isactually done upon our finite(Footnote continued from previous page)pray for all. Most of all I have learned to pray! And although I have still much to learn in this domain, prayer ever brings me morestrength, consolation, and comfort. I feel more than ever that I have only made a few steps on the long road of progress; but I look at itslength without dismay, for I have confidence that the day will come when all my efforts shall be rewarded.

The universe, at those parts of it which our personal being constitutes, takes a turngenuinely for the worse or for the better in proportion as each one of us fulfills or evades God's demands. As far asthis goes I probably have you with me, for I only translate into schematic language what I may call the instinctivebelief of mankind: God is real since he produces real effects.The real effects in question, so far as I have as yet admitted them, are exerted on the personal centres of energy of thevarious subjects, but the spontaneous faith of most of the1That the transaction of opening ourselves, otherwise called prayer, is a perfectly definite one for certain persons, appears abundantly inthe preceding lectures. I append another concrete example to reinforce the impression on the reader's mind:—\"Man can learn to transcend these limitations [of finite thought] and draw power and wisdom at will. The divine presence is known throughexperience. The turning to a higher plane is a distinct act of consciousness. It is not a vague, twilight or semi-conscious experience. It is notan ecstasy; it is not a trance. It is not super-consciousness in the Vedantic sense. It is not due to self-hypnotization. It is a perfectly calm,sane, sound, rational, common-sense shifting of consciousness from the phenomena of sense-perception to the phenomena of seership, fromthe thought of self to a distinctively higher realm. For example, if the lower self be nervous, anxious, tense, one can in a few momentscompel it to be calm. This is not done by a word simply. Again I say, it is not hypnotism. It is by the exercise of power. One feels the spirit ofpeace as definitely as heat is perceived on a hot summer day. The power can be as surely used as the sun's rays can be focused and made todo work, to set fire to wood.\" The Higher Law, vol. iv. pp. 4, 6, Boston, August, 1901.2Transcendentalists are fond of the term 'Over-soul,' but as a rule they use it in an intellectualist sense, as meaning only a medium ofcommunion. 'God' is a causal agent as well as a medium of communion, and that is the aspect which I wish to emphasize."},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP462 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 45]Page 462subjects is that they embrace a wider sphere than this. Most religious men believe (or 'know,' if they be mystical) thatnot only they themselves, but the whole universe of beings to whom the God is present, are secure in his parentalhands. There is a sense, a dimension, they are sure, in which we are all saved, in spite of the gates of hell and alladverse terrestrial appearances. God's existence is the guarantee of an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved.This world may indeed, as science assures us, some day burn up or freeze; but if it is part of his order, the old idealsare sure to be brought elsewhere to fruition, so that where God is, tragedy is only provisional and partial, andshipwreck and dissolution are not the absolutely final things. Only when this farther step of faith concerning God istaken, and remote objective consequences are predicted, does religion, as it seems to me, get wholly free from the firstimmediate subjective experience, and bring a real hypothesis into play. A good hypothesis in science must have otherproperties than those of the phenomenon it is immediately invoked to explain, otherwise it is not prolific enough. God,meaning only what enters into the religious man's experience of union, falls short of being an hypothesis of this moreuseful order. He needs to enter into wider cosmic relations in order to justify the subject's absolute confidence andpeace.That the God with whom, starting from the hither side of our own extra-marginal self, we come at its remoter margininto commerce should be the absolute world-ruler, is of course a very considerable over-belief. Over-belief as it is,though, it is an article of almost every one's religion. Most of us pretend in some way to prop it upon our philosophy,but the philosophy itself is really propped upon this faith. What is this but to say that Religion, in her fullest exerciseof function, is not a mere illumination of facts already elsewhere given, not a mere passion, like love, which viewsthings in a rosier light. It is indeed that, as we have seen abundantly. But it is something more, namely, a postulator ofnew facts as well. The world interpreted religiously is not the materialistic world over again, with an alteredexpression; it must have, over and above the altered expression, a natural constitution different at some point fromthat which a materialistic world"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP463 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 46]Page 463would have. It must be such that different events can be expected in it, different conduct must be required.This thoroughly 'pragmatic' view of religion has usually been taken as a matter of course by common men. They haveinterpolated divine miracles into the field of nature, they have built a heaven out beyond the grave. It is onlytranscendentalist metaphysicians who think that, without adding any concrete details to Nature, or subtracting any, butby simply calling it the expression of absolute spirit, you make it more divine just as it stands. I believe the pragmaticway of taking religion to be the deeper way. It gives it body as well as soul, it makes it claim, as everything real mustclaim, some characteristic realm of fact as its very own. What the more characteristically divine facts are, apart fromthe actual inflow of energy in the faith-state and the prayer-state, I know not. But the over-belief on which I am readyto make my personal venture is that they exist. The whole drift of my education goes to persuade me that the world ofour present consciousness is only one out of many worlds of consciousness that exist, and that those other worldsmust contain experiences which have a meaning for our life also; and that although in the main their experiences andthose of this world keep discrete, yet the two become continuous at certain points, and higher energies filter in. Bybeing faithful in my poor measure to this over-belief, I seem to myself to keep more sane and true. I can, of course,put myself into the sectarian scientist's attitude, and imagine vividly that the world of sensations and of scientific lawsand objects may be all. But whenever I do this, I hear that inward monitor of which W. K. Clifford once wrote,whispering the word 'bosh!' Humbug is humbug, even though it bear the scientific name, and the total expression ofhuman experience, as I view it objectively, invincibly urges me beyond the narrow 'scientific' bounds. Assuredly, thereal world is of a different temperament,—more intricately built than physical science allows. So my objective and mysubjective conscience both hold me to the over-belief which I express. Who knows whether the faithfulness ofindividuals here below to their own poor over-beliefs may not actually help God in turn to be more effectively faithfulto his own greater tasks?"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP464 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 47]Page 464PostscriptIn writing my concluding lecture I had to aim so much at simplification that I fear that my general philosophicposition received so scant a statement as hardly to be intelligible to some of my readers. I therefore add this epilogue,which must also be so brief as possibly to remedy but little the defect. In a later work I may be enabled to state myposition more amply and consequently more clearly.Originality cannot be expected in a field like this, where all the attitudes and tempers that are possible have beenexhibited in literature long ago, and where any new writer can immediately be classed under a familiar head. If oneshould make a division of all thinkers into naturalists and supernaturalists, I should undoubtedly have to go, alongwith most philosophers, into the supernaturalist branch. But there is a crasser and a more refined supernaturalism, andit is to the refined division that most philosophers at the present day belong. If not regular transcendental idealists,they at least obey the Kantian direction enough to bar out ideal entities from interfering causally in the course ofphenomenal events. Refined supernaturalism is universalistic supernaturalism; for the 'crasser' variety 'piecemeal'supernaturalism would perhaps be the better name. It went with that older theology which today is supposed to reignonly among uneducated people, or to be found among the few belated professors of the dualisms which Kant isthought to have displaced. It admits miracles and providential leadings, and finds no intellectual difficulty in mixingthe ideal and the real worlds together by interpolating influences from the ideal region among the forces that causallydetermine the real world's details. In this the refined supernaturalists think that it muddles disparate dimensions ofexistence. For them the world of the ideal has no efficient causality, and never bursts into the world of phenomena atparticular points. The ideal world, for them, is not a world of facts, but only of the meaning of facts; it is a point ofview for judging facts. It appertains to a different '-ology,' and inhabits a different dimension of being altogether fromthat in which existential propositions obtain. It cannot get down"},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP465 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 48]Page 465upon the flat level of experience and interpolate itself piecemeal between distinct portions of nature, as those whobelieve, for example, in divine aid coming in response to prayer, are bound to think it must.Notwithstanding my own inability to accept either popular Christianity or scholastic theism, I suppose that my beliefthat in communion with the Ideal new force comes into the world, and new departures are made here below, subjectsme to being classed among the supernaturalists of the piecemeal or crasser type. Universalistic supernaturalismsurrenders, it seems to me, too easily to naturalism. It takes the facts of physical science at their face-value, and leavesthe laws of life just as naturalism finds them, with no hope of remedy, in case their fruits are bad. It confines itself tosentiments about life as a whole, sentiments which may be admiring and adoring, but which need not be so, as theexistence of systematic pessimism proves. In this universalistic way of taking the ideal world, the essence of practicalreligion seems to me to evaporate. Both instinctively and for logical reasons, I find it hard to believe that principlescan exist which make no difference in facts.1 But all facts are particular facts, and the whole interest of the questionof God's existence seems to me to lie in the consequences for particulars which that existence may be expected toentail. That no concrete particular of experience should alter its complexion in consequence of a God being thereseems to me an incredible proposition, and yet it is the thesis to which (implicitly at any rate) refined supernaturalism1Transcendental idealism, of course, insists that its ideal world makes this difference, that facts exist. We owe it to the Absolute that wehave a world of fact at all. 'A world' of fact!—that exactly is the trouble. An entire world is the smallest unit with which the Absolute canwork, whereas to our finite minds work for the better ought to be done within this world, setting in at single points. Our difficulties andour ideals are all piecemeal affairs, but the Absolute can do no piecework for us; so that all the interests which our poor souls compassraise their heads too late. We should have spoken earlier, prayed for another world absolutely, before this world was born. It is strange, Ihave heard a friend say, to see this blind corner into which Christian thought has worked itself at last, with its God who can raise noparticular weight whatever, who can help us with no private burden, and who is on the side of our enemies as much as he is on our own.Odd evolution from the God of David's psalms!"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP466 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 49]Page 466seems to cling. It is only with experience en bloc, it says, that the Absolute maintains relations. It condescends to notransactions of detail.I am ignorant of Buddhism and speak under correction, and merely in order the better to describe my general point ofview; but as I apprehend the Buddhistic doctrine of Karma, I agree in principle with that. All supernaturalists admitthat facts are under the judgment of higher law; but for Buddhism as I interpret it, and for religion generally so far asit remains unweakened by transcendentalistic metaphysics, the word 'judgment' here means no such bare academicverdict or platonic appreciation as it means in Vedantic or modern absolutist systems; it carries, on the contrary,execution with it, is in rebus as well as post rem, and operates 'causally' as partial factor in the total fact. The universebecomes a gnosticism1 pure and simple on any other terms. But this view that judgment and execution go together isthat of the crasser supernaturalist way of thinking, so the present volume must on the whole be classed with the otherexpressions of that creed.I state the matter thus bluntly, because the current of thought in academic circles runs against me, and I feel like aman who must set his back against an open door quickly if he does not wish to see it closed and locked. In spite of itsbeing so shocking to the reigning intellectual tastes, I believe that a candid consideration of piecemeal supernaturalismand a complete discussion of all its metaphysical bearings will show it to be the hypothesis by which the largestnumber of legitimate requirements are met. That of course would be a program for other books than this; what I nowsay sufficiently indicates to the philosophic reader the place where I belong.If asked just where the differences in fact which are due to God's existence come in, I should have to say that ingeneral I have no hypothesis to offer beyond what the phenomenon of 'prayerful communion,' especially when certainkinds of incursion from the subconscious region take part in it, imme-1See my Will to Believe and other Essays in Popular Philosophy, 1897, p. 165."},{"pageNumber":481,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP467 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 50]Page 467diately suggests. The appearance is that in this phenomenon something ideal, which in one sense is part of ourselvesand in another sense is not ourselves, actually exerts an influence, raises our centre of personal energy, and producesregenerative effects unattainable in other ways. If, then, there be a wider world of being than that of our every-dayconsciousness, if in it there be forces whose effects on us are intermittent, if one facilitating condition of the effects bethe openness of the 'subliminal' door, we have the elements of a theory to which the phenomena of religious life lendplausibility. I am so impressed by the importance of these phenomena that I adopt the hypothesis which they sonaturally suggest. At these places at least, I say, it would seem as though transmundane energies, God, if you will,produced immediate effects within the natural world to which the rest of our experience belongs.The difference in natural 'fact' which most of us would assign as the first difference which the existence of a Godought to make would, I imagine, be personal immortality. Religion, in fact, for the great majority of our own racemeans immortality, and nothing else. God is the producer of immortality; and whoever has doubts of immortality iswritten down as an atheist without farther trial. I have said nothing in my lectures about immortality or the belieftherein, for to me it seems a secondary point. If only our ideals are cared for in 'eternity,' I do not see why we mightnot be willing to resign their care to other hands than ours. Yet I sympathize with the urgent impulse to be presentourselves, and in the conflict of impulses, both of them so vague yet both of them noble, I know not how to decide. Itseems to me that it is eminently a case for facts to testify. Facts, I think, are yet lacking to prove 'spirit-return,' thoughI have the highest respect for the patient labors of Messrs. Myers, Hodgson, and Hyslop, and am somewhat impressedby their favorable conclusions. I consequently leave the matter open, with this brief word to save the reader from apossible perplexity as to why immortality got no mention in the body of this book.The ideal power with which we feel ourselves in connection, the 'God' of ordinary men, is, both by ordinary men andby philosophers, endowed with certain of those metaphysical"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP468 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 51]Page 468attributes which in the lecture on philosophy I treated with such disrespect. He is assumed as a matter of course to be'one and only' and to be 'infinite'; and the notion of many finite gods is one which hardly any one thinks it worthwhile to consider, and still less to uphold. Nevertheless, in the interests of intellectual clearness, I feel bound to saythat religious experience, as we have studied it, cannot be cited as unequivocally supporting the infinitist belief. Theonly thing that it unequivocally testifies to is that we can experience union with something larger than ourselves and inthat union find our greatest peace: Philosophy, with its passion for unity, and mysticism with its mono-ideistic bent,both 'pass to the limit' and identify the something with a unique God who is the all-inclusive soul of the world.Popular opinion, respectful to their authority, follows the example which they set.Meanwhile the practical needs and experiences of religion seem to me sufficiently met by the belief that beyond eachman and in a fashion continuous with him there exists a larger power which is friendly to him and to his ideals. Allthat the facts require is that the power should be both other and larger than our conscious selves. Anything larger willdo, if only it be large enough to trust for the next step. It need not be infinite, it need not be solitary. It mightconceivably even be only a larger and more godlike self, of which the present self would then be but the mutilatedexpression, and the universe might conceivably be a collection of such selves, of different degrees of inclusiveness,with no absolute unity realized in it at all.1 Thus would a sort of polytheism return upon us—a polytheism which I donot on this occasion defend, for my only aim at present is to keep the testimony of religious experience clearly withinits proper bounds.2Upholders of the monistic view will say to such a polytheism (which, by the way, has always been the real religion ofcommon people, and is so still to-day) that unless there be one all-inclusive God, our guarantee of security is leftimperfect. In the Absolute, and in the Absolute only, all is saved. If there be different gods, each caring for his part,some por-1Such a notion is suggested in my Ingersoll Lecture On Human Immortality, Boston and London, 1899.2Cf. above pp. 124 125."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP469 hl[01 03 2011 00 36 52]Page 469tion of some of us might not be covered with divine protection, and our religious consolation would thus fail to becomplete. It goes back to what was said on pages 124 126, about the possibility of there being portions of the universethat may irretrievably be lost. Common sense is less sweeping in its demands than philosophy or mysticism have beenwont to be, and can suffer the notion of this world being partly saved and partly lost. The ordinary moralistic state ofmind makes the salvation of the world conditional upon the success with which each unit does its part. Partial andconditional salvation is in fact a most familiar notion when taken in the abstract, the only difficulty being to determinethe details. Some men are even disinterested enough to be willing to be in the unsaved remnant as far as their personsgo, if only they can be persuaded that their cause will prevail—all of us are willing, whenever our activity-excitementrises sufficiently high. I think, in fact, that a final philosophy of religion will have to consider the pluralistichypothesis more seriously than it has hitherto been willing to consider it. For practical life at any rate, the chance ofsalvation is enough. No fact in human nature is more characteristic than its willingness to live on a chance. Theexistence of the chance makes the difference, as Edmund Gurney says, between a life of which the keynote isresignation and a life of which the keynote is hope.1 But all these statements are unsatisfactory from their brevity, andI can only say that I hope to return to the same questions in another book.1Tertium Quid, 1887, p. 99.

They are printed as delivered, without developments or notes.The pragmatic movement, so-called—I do not like the name, but apparently it is too late to change it—seems to haverather suddenly precipitated itself out of the air. A number of tendencies that have always existed in philosophy haveall at once become conscious of themselves collectively, and of their combined mission; and this has occurred in somany countries, and from so many different points of view, that much unconcerted statement has resulted. I havesought to unify the picture as it presents itself to my own eyes, dealing in broad strokes, and avoiding minutecontroversy. Much futile controversy might have been avoided, I believe, if our critics had been willing to wait untilwe got our message fairly out.If my lectures interest any reader in the general subject, he will doubtless wish to read farther. I therefore give him afew references.In America, JOHN DEWEY'S 'Studies in Logical Theory' are the foundation. Read also by DEWEY the articles in thePhilosophical Review, vol. xv, pp. 113 and 465, in Mind, vol. xv, p. 293, and in the Journal of Philosophy, vol. iv, p.197.Probably the best statements to begin with, however, are F. C. S. SCHILLER'S in his 'Studies in Humanism,' especially theessays numbered i, v, vi, vii, xviii and xix. His previous essays and in general the polemic literature of the subject arefully referred to in his footnotes.Furthermore, see G. MILHAUD: le Rationnel, 1898, and the fine articles by LE ROY in the Revue de Métaphysique, vols.7, 8 and 9. Also articles by BLONDEL and DE SAILLY in the Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne, 4me Série, vols. 2 and 3.PAPINI announces a book on Pragmatism, in the French language, to be published very soon.To avoid one misunderstanding at least, let me say that there is no logical connexion between pragmatism, as I"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP482 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 22]Page 482understand it, and a doctrine which I have recently set forth as 'radical empiricism.'

collection of essays of his called 'Heretics,' Mr. Chesterton writes these words: ''Thereare some people—and I am one of them—who think that the most practical and important thing about a man is stillhis view of the universe. We think that for a landlady considering a lodger it is important to know his income, but stillmore important to know his philosophy. We think that for a general about to fight an enemy it is important to knowthe enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's philosophy. We think the question is not whetherthe theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the long run anything else affects them.\"I think with Mr. Chesterton in this matter. I know that you, ladies and gentlemen, have a philosophy, each and all ofyou, and that the most interesting and important thing about you is the way in which it determines the perspective inyour several worlds. You know the same of me. And yet I confess to a certain tremor at the audacity of the enterprisewhich I am about to begin. For the philosophy which is so important in each of us is not a technical matter; it is ourmore or less dumb sense of what life honestly and deeply means. It is only partly got from books; it is our individualway of just seeing and feeling the total push and pressure of the cosmos. I have no right to assume that many of youare students of the cosmos in the classroom sense, yet here I stand desirous of interesting you in a philosophy whichto no small extent has to be technically treated. I wish to fill you with sympathy with a contemporaneous tendency inwhich I profoundly believe, and yet I have to talk like a professor to you who are not students. Whatever universe aprofessor believes in must at any rate be a universe that lends itself to lengthy discourse. A universe definable in twosentences is something for which the professorial intellect has no use. No faith in anything of that cheap kind! I haveheard friends and colleagues try to popularize philosophy in this very hall, but they soon grew"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP488 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 28]Page 488dry, and then technical, and the results were only partially encouraging. So my enterprise is a bold one. The founderof pragmatism himself recently gave a course of lectures at the Lowell Institute with that very word in its title,—flashes of brilliant light relieved against Cimmerian darkness! None of us, I fancy, understood all that he said—yethere I stand, making a very similar venture.I risk it because the very lectures I speak of drew—they brought good audiences. There is, it must be confessed, acurious fascination in hearing deep things talked about, even though neither we nor the disputants understand them.We get the problematic thrill, we feel the presence of the vastness. Let a controversy begin in a smoking-roomanywhere, about free-will or God's omniscience, or good and evil, and see how every one in the place pricks up hisears. Philosophy's results concern us all most vitally, and philosophy's queerest arguments tickle agreeably our senseof subtlety and ingenuity.Believing in philosophy myself devoutly, and believing also that a kind of new dawn is breaking upon usphilosophers, I feel impelled, per fas aut nefas, to try to impart to you some news of the situation.Philosophy is at once the most sublime and the most trivial of human pursuits. It works in the minutest crannies and itopens out the widest vistas. It 'bakes no bread,' as has been said, but it can inspire our souls with courage; andrepugnant as its manners, its doubting and challenging, its quibbling and dialectics, often are to common people, noone of us can get along without the far-flashing beams of light it sends over the world's perspectives. Theseilluminations at least, and the contrast-effects of darkness and mystery that accompany them, give to what it says aninterest that is much more than professional.The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash of human temperaments. Undignified as such atreatment may seem to some of my colleagues, I shall have to take account of this clash and explain a good many ofthe divergencies of philosophers by it. Of whatever temperament a professional philosopher is, he tries, whenphilosophizing, to sink the fact of his temperament. Temperament is no conventionally recognized reason, so he urgesimpersonal reasons"},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP489 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 29]Page 489only for his conclusions. Yet his temperament really gives him a stronger bias than any of his more strictly objectivepremises. It loads the evidence for him one way or the other, making for a more sentimental or a more hard-heartedview of the universe, just as this fact or that principle would. He trusts his temperament. Wanting a universe that suitsit, he believes in any representation of the universe that does suit it. He feels men of opposite temper to be out of keywith the world's character, and in his heart considers them incompetent and 'not in it,' in the philosophic business,even though they may far excel him in dialectical ability.Yet in the forum he can make no claim, on the bare ground of his temperament, to superior discernment or authority.There arises thus a certain insincerity in our philosophic discussions: the potentest of all our premises is nevermentioned. I am sure it would contribute to clearness if in these lectures we should break this rule and mention it, andI accordingly feel free to do so.Of course I am talking here of very positively marked men, men of radical idiosyncracy, who have set their stamp andlikeness on philosophy and figure in its history. Plato, Locke, Hegel, Spencer, are such temperamental thinkers. Mostof us have, of course, no very definite intellectual temperament, we are a mixture of opposite ingredients, each onepresent very moderately. We hardly know our own preferences in abstract matters; some of us are easily talked out ofthem, and end by following the fashion or taking up with the beliefs of the most impressive philosopher in ourneighborhood, whoever he may be. But the one thing that has counted so far in philosophy is that a man should seethings, see them straight in his own peculiar way, and be dissatisfied with any opposite way of seeing them. There isno reason to suppose that this strong temperamental vision is from now onward to count no longer in the history ofman's beliefs.Now the particular difference of temperament that I have in mind in making these remarks is one that has counted inliterature, art, government, and manners as well as in philosophy. In manners we find formalists and free-and-easypersons. In government, authoritarians and anarchists. In literature, purists or academicals, and realists. In art, classics"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP490 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 30]Page 490and romantics. You recognize these contrasts as familiar; well, in philosophy we have a very similar contrastexpressed in the pair of terms 'rationalist' and 'empiricist,' 'empiricist' meaning your lover of facts in all their crudevariety, 'rationalist' meaning your devotee to abstract and eternal principles. No one can live an hour without bothfacts and principles, so it is a difference rather of emphasis; yet it breeds antipathies of the most pungent characterbetween those who lay the emphasis differently; and we shall find it extraordinarily convenient to express a certaincontrast in men's ways of taking their universe, by talking of the 'empiricist' and of the 'rationalist' temper. Theseterms make the contrast simple and massive.More simple and massive than are usually the men of whom the terms are predicated. For every sort of permutationand combination is possible in human nature; and if I now proceed to define more fully what I have in mind when Ispeak of rationalists and empiricists, by adding to each of those titles some secondary qualifying characteristics, I begyou to regard my conduct as to a certain extent arbitrary. I select types of combination that nature offers veryfrequently, but by no means uniformly, and I select them solely for their convenience in helping me to my ulteriorpurpose of characterizing pragmatism. Historically we find the terms 'intellectualism' and 'sensationalism' used assynonyms of 'rationalism' and 'empiricism.' Well, nature seems to combine most frequently with intellectualism anidealistic and optimistic tendency. Empiricists on the other hand are not uncommonly materialistic, and their optimismis apt to be decidedly conditional and tremulous. Rationalism is always monistic. It starts from wholes and universals,and makes much of the unity of things. Empiricism starts from the parts, and makes of the whole a collection—is notaverse therefore to calling itself pluralistic. Rationalism usually considers itself more religious than empiricism, butthere is much to say about this claim, so I merely mention it. It is a true claim when the individual rationalist is whatis called a man of feeling, and when the individual empiricist prides himself on being hard-headed. In that case therationalist will usually also be in favor of what is called free-will, and the empiricist will be a"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP491 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 31]Page 491fatalist—I use the terms most popularly current. The rationalist finally will be of dogmatic temper in his affirmations,while the empiricist may be more sceptical and open to discussion.I will write these traits down in two columns. I think you will practically recognize the two types of mental make-upthat I mean if I head the columns by the titles 'tender-minded' and 'tough-minded' respectively.THE TENDER-MINDED.THE TOUGH-MINDED.Rationalistic (going by 'principles'),Empiricist (going by 'facts'),Intellectualistic,Sensationalistic,Idealistic,Materialistic,Optimistic,Pessimistic,Religious,Irreligious,Free-willist,Fatalistic,Monistic,Pluralistic,Dogmatical.Sceptical.Pray postpone for a moment the question whether the two contrasted mixtures which I have written down are eachinwardly coherent and self-consistent or not—I shall very soon have a good deal to say on that point. It suffices forour immediate purpose that tender-minded and tough-minded people, characterized as I have written them down, doboth exist. Each of you probably knows some well-marked example of each type, and you know what each examplethinks of the example on the other side of the line. They have a low opinion of each other. Their antagonism,whenever as individuals their temperaments have been intense, has formed in all ages a part of the philosophicatmosphere of the time. It forms a part of the philosophic atmosphere to-day. The tough think of the tender assentimentalists and soft-heads. The tender feel the tough to be unrefined, callous, or brutal. Their mutual reaction isvery much like that that takes place when Bostonian tourists mingle with a population like that of Cripple Creek. Eachtype believes the other to be inferior to itself; but disdain in the one case is mingled with amusement, in the other ithas a dash of fear.Now, as I have already insisted, few of us are tender-foot Bostonians pure and simple, and few are typical RockyMountain toughs, in philosophy. Most of us have a hankering"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP492 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 33]Page 492for the good things on both sides of the line. Facts are good, of course—give us lots of facts. Principles are good—give us plenty of principles. The world is indubitably one if you look at it in one way, but as indubitably is it many, ifyou look at it in another. It is both one and many—let us adopt a sort of pluralistic monism. Everything of course isnecessarily determined, and yet of course our wills are free: a sort of free-will determinism is the true philosophy. Theevil of the parts is undeniable, but the whole can't be evil: so practical pessimism may be combined with metaphysicaloptimism. And so forth—your ordinary philosophic layman never being a radical, never straightening out his system,but living vaguely in one plausible compartment of it or another to suit the temptations of successive hours.But some of us are more than mere laymen in philosophy. We are worthy of the name of amateur athletes, and arevexed by too much inconsistency and vacillation in our creed. We cannot preserve a good intellectual conscience solong as we keep mixing incompatibles from opposite sides of the line.And now I come to the first positively important point which I wish to make. Never were as many men of a decidedlyempiricist proclivity in existence as there are at the present day. Our children, one may say, are almost born scientific.But our esteem for facts has not neutralized in us all religiousness. It is itself almost religious. Our scientific temper isdevout. Now take a man of this type, and let him be also a philosophic amateur, unwilling to mix a hodge-podgesystem after the fashion of a common layman, and what does he find his situation to be, in this blessed year of ourLord 1906? He wants facts; he wants science; but he also wants a religion. And being an amateur and not anindependent originator in philosophy he naturally looks for guidance to the experts and professionals whom he findsalready in the field. A very large number of you here present, possibly a majority of you, are amateurs of just this sort.Now what kinds of philosophy do you find actually offered to meet your need? You find an empirical philosophy thatis not religious enough, and a religious philosophy that is not empirical enough for your purpose. If you look to thequarter"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP493 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 39]Page 493where facts are most considered you find the whole tough-minded program in operation, and the 'conflict betweenscience and religion' in full blast. Either it is that Rocky Mountain tough of a Haeckel with his materialistic monism,his ether-god and his jest at your God as a 'gaseous vertebrate'; or it is Spencer treating the world's history as aredistribution of matter and motion solely, and bowing religion politely out at the front door:—she may indeedcontinue to exist, but she must never show her face inside the temple.For a hundred and fifty years past the progress of science has seemed to mean the enlargement of the materialuniverse and the diminution of man's importance. The result is what one may call the growth of naturalistic orpositivistic feeling. Man is no lawgiver to nature, he is an absorber. She it is who stands firm; he it is who mustaccommodate himself. Let him record truth, inhuman though it be, and submit to it! The romantic spontaneity andcourage are gone, the vision is materialistic and depressing. Ideals appear as inert by-products of physiology; what ishigher is explained by what is lower and treated forever as a case of 'nothing but'—nothing but something else of aquite inferior sort. You get, in short, a materialistic universe, in which only the tough-minded find themselvescongenially at home.If now, on the other hand, you turn to the religious quarter for consolation, and take counsel of the tender-mindedphilosophies, what do you find?Religious philosophy in our day and generation is, among us English-reading people, of two main types. One of theseis more radical and aggressive, the other has more the air of fighting a slow retreat. By the more radical wing ofreligious philosophy I mean the so-called transcendental idealism of the Anglo-Hegelian school, the philosophy ofsuch men as Green, the Cairds, Bosanquet, and Royce. This philosophy has greatly influenced the more studiousmembers of our protestant ministry. It is pantheistic, and undoubtedly it has already blunted the edge of the traditionaltheism in protestantism at large.That theism remains, however. It is the lineal descendant, through one stage of concession after another, of thedogmatic scholastic theism still taught rigorously in the semi-"},{"pageNumber":529,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP494 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 40]Page 494naries of the catholic church. For a long time it used to be called among us the philosophy of the Scottish school. It iswhat I meant by the philosophy that has the air of fighting a slow retreat. Between the encroachments of the hegeliansand other philosophers of the 'Absolute,' on the one hand, and those of the scientific evolutionists and agnostics, onthe other, the men that give us this kind of a philosophy, James Martineau, Professor Bowne, Professor Ladd andothers, must feel themselves rather tightly squeezed. Fair-minded and candid as you like, this philosophy is not radicalin temper. It is eclectic, a thing of compromises, that seeks a modus vivendi above all things. It accepts the facts ofDarwinism, the facts of cerebral physiology, but it does nothing active or enthusiastic with them. It lacks thevictorious and aggressive note. It lacks prestige in consequence; whereas absolutism has a certain prestige due to themore radical style of it.These two systems are what you have to choose between if you turn to the tender-minded school. And if you are thelovers of facts I have supposed you to be, you find the trail of the serpent of rationalism, of intellectualism, overeverything that lies on that side of the line. You escape indeed the materialism that goes with the reigning empiricism;but you pay for your escape by losing contact with the concrete parts of life. The more absolutistic philosophers dwellon so high a level of abstraction that they never even try to come down. The absolute mind which they offer us, themind that makes our universe by thinking it, might, for aught they show us to the contrary, have made any one of amillion other universes just as well as this. You can deduce no single actual particular from the notion of it. It iscompatible with any state of things whatever being true here below. And the theistic God is almost as sterile aprinciple. You have to go to the world which he has created to get any inkling of his actual character: he is the kindof god that has once for all made that kind of a world. The God of the theistic writers lives on as purely abstractheights as does the Absolute. Absolutism has a certain sweep and dash about it, while the usual theism is more insipid,but both are equally remote and vacuous. What you want is a philosophy that will not only exercise your powers"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP495 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 41]Page 495of intellectual abstraction, but that will make some positive connexion with this actual world of finite human lives.You want a system that will combine both things, the scientific loyalty to facts and willingness to take account ofthem, the spirit of adaptation and accommodation, in short, but also the old confidence in human values and theresultant spontaneity, whether of the religious or of the romantic type. And this is then your dilemma: you find the twoparts of your quaesitum hopelessly separated. You find empiricism with in humanism and irreligion; or else you find arationalistic philosophy that indeed may call itself religious, but that keeps out of all definite touch with concrete factsand joys and sorrows.I am not sure how many of you live close enough to philosophy to realize fully what I mean by this last reproach, so Iwill dwell a little longer on that unreality in all rationalistic systems by which your serious believer in facts is so apt tofeel repelled.I wish that I had saved the first couple of pages of a thesis which a student handed me a year or two ago. Theyillustrated my point so clearly that I am sorry I can not read them to you now. This young man, who was a graduate ofsome Western college, began by saying that he had always taken for granted that when you entered a philosophicclassroom you had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street.The two were supposed, he said, to have so little to do with each other, that you could not possibly occupy your mindwith them at the same time. The world of concrete personal experiences to which the street belongs is multitudinousbeyond imagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which your philosophy-professorintroduces you is simple, clean and noble. The contradictions of real life are absent from it. Its architecture is classic.Principles of reason trace its outlines, logical necessities cement its parts. Purity and dignity are what it mostexpresses. It is a kind of marble temple shining on a hill.In point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than a clear addition built upon it, a classic sanctuary inwhich"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP496 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 42]Page 496the rationalist fancy may take refuge from the intolerably confused and gothic character which mere facts present. It isno explanation of our concrete universe, it is another thing altogether, a substitute for it, a remedy, a way of escape.Its temperament, if I may use the word temperament here, is utterly alien to the temperament of existence in theconcrete. Refinement is what characterizes our intellectualist philosophies. They exquisitely satisfy that craving for arefined object of contemplation which is so powerful an appetite of the mind. But I ask you in all seriousness to lookabroad on this colossal universe of concrete facts, on their awful bewilderments, their surprises and cruelties, on thewildness which they show, and then to tell me whether 'refined' is the one inevitable descriptive adjective that springsto your lips.Refinement has its place in things, true enough. But a philosophy that breathes out nothing but refinement will neversatisfy the empiricist temper of mind. It will seem rather a monument of artificiality. So we find men of sciencepreferring to turn their backs on metaphysics as on something altogether cloistered and spectral, and practical menshaking philosophy's dust off their feet and following the call of the wild.Truly there is something a little ghastly in the satisfaction with which a pure but unreal system will fill a rationalistmind. Leibnitz was a rationalist mind, with infinitely more interest in facts than most rationalist minds can show. Yetif you wish for superficiality incarnate, you have only to read that charmingly written 'Théodicée' of his, in which hesought to justify the ways of God to man, and to prove that the world we live in is the best of possible worlds. Let mequote a specimen of what I mean.Among other obstacles to his optimistic philosophy, it falls to Leibnitz to consider the number of the eternallydamned. That it is infinitely greater, in our human case, than that of those saved, he assumes as a premise from thetheologians, and then proceeds to argue in this way. Even then, he says:\"The evil will appear as almost nothing in comparison with the good, if we once consider the real magnitude of theCity of God. Coelius Secundus Curio has written a little book, 'De Amplitudine Regni Coelestis,' which was reprintednot long"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP497 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 43]Page 497ago. But he failed to compass the extent of the kingdom of the heavens. The ancients had small ideas of the works ofGod . It seemed to them that only our earth had inhabitants, and even the notion of our antipodes gave them pause.The rest of the world for them consisted of some shining globes and a few crystalline spheres. But to-day, whateverbe the limits that we may grant or refuse to the Universe we must recognize in it a countless number of globes, as bigas ours or bigger, which have just as much right as it has to support rational inhabitants, tho it does not follow thatthese need all be men. Our earth is only one among the six principal satellites of our sun. As all the fixed stars aresuns, one sees how small a place among visible things our earth takes up, since it is only a satellite of one amongthem. Now all these suns may be inhabited by none but happy creatures; and nothing obliges us to believe that thenumber of damned persons is very great; for a very few instances and samples suffice for the utility which good drawsfrom evil. Moreover, since there is no reason to suppose that there are stars everywhere, may there not be a great spacebeyond the region of the stars? And this immense space, surrounding all this region, may be replete with happinessand glory . What now becomes of the consideration of our Earth and of its denizens? Does it not dwindle tosomething incomparably less than a physical point, since our Earth is but a point compared with the distance of thefixed stars. Thus the part of the Universe which we know, being almost lost in nothingness compared with that whichis unknown to us, but which we are yet obliged to admit; and all the evils that we know lying in this almost-nothing; itfollows that the evils may be almost-nothing in comparison with the goods that the Universe contains.''Leibnitz continues elsewhere:\"There is a kind of justice which aims neither at the amendment of the criminal, nor at furnishing an example toothers, nor at the reparation of the injury. This justice is founded in pure fitness, which finds a certain satisfaction inthe expiation of a wicked deed. The Socinians and Hobbes objected to this punitive justice, which is properlyvindictive justice, and which God has reserved for himself at many junctures . It is always founded in the fitness ofthings, and satisfies not"},{"pageNumber":533,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP498 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 44]Page 498only the offended party, but all wise lookers-on, even as beautiful music or a fine piece of architecture satisfies awell-constituted mind. It is thus that the torments of the damned continue, even tho they serve no longer to turn anyone away from sin, and that the rewards of the blest continue, even tho they confirm no one in good ways. Thedamned draw to themselves ever new penalties by their continuing sins, and the blest attract ever fresh joys by theirunceasing progress in good. Both facts are founded on the principle of fitness, for God has made all thingsharmonious in perfection as I have already said.\"Leibnitz's feeble grasp of reality is too obvious to need comment from me. It is evident that no realistic image of theexperience of a damned soul had ever approached the portals of his mind. Nor had it occurred to him that the smalleris the number of 'samples' of the genus 'lost-soul' whom God throws as a sop to the eternal fitness, the moreunequitably grounded is the glory of the blest. What he gives us is a cold literary exercise, whose cheerful substanceeven hell-fire does not warm.And do not tell me that to show the shallowness of rationalist philosophizing I have had to go back to a shallowwigpated age. The optimism of present-day rationalism sounds just as shallow to the fact-loving mind. The actualuniverse is a thing wide open, but rationalism makes systems, and systems must be closed. For men in practical lifeperfection is something far off and still in process of achievement. This for rationalism is but the illusion of the finiteand relative: the absolute ground of things is a perfection eternally complete.I find a fine example of revolt against the airy and shallow optimism of current religious philosophy in a publicationof that valiant anarchistic writer Morrison I. Swift. Mr. Swift's anarchism goes a little farther than mine does, but Iconfess that I sympathize a good deal, and some of you, I know, will sympathize heartily with his dissatisfaction withthe idealistic optimisms now in vogue. He begins his pamphlet on 'Human Submission' with a series of city reporter'sitems from newspapers (suicides, deaths from starvation, and the like) as specimens of our civilized régime. Forinstance:\"After trudging through the snow from one end of the city"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP499 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 55]Page 499to the other in the vain hope of securing employment, and with his wife and six children without food and ordered toleave their home in an upper east-side tenement-house because of non-payment of rent, John Corcoran, a clerk, to-day ended his life by drinking carbolic acid. Corcoran lost his position three weeks ago through illness, and during theperiod of idleness his scanty savings disappeared. Yesterday he obtained work with a gang of city snow-shovelers, buthe was too weak from illness, and was forced to quit after an hour's trial with the shovel. Then the weary task oflooking for employment was again resumed. Thoroughly discouraged, Corcoran returned to his home last night to findhis wife and children without food and the notice of dispossession on the door. On the following morning he drankthe poison.\"The records of many more such cases lie before me [Mr. Swift goes on]; an encyclopedia might easily be filled withtheir kind. These few I cite as an interpretation of the Universe. 'We are aware of the presence of God in his world,'says a writer in a recent English review. [The very presence of ill in the temporal order is the condition of theperfection of the eternal order, writes Professor Royce (The World and the Individual, II, 385).] 'The Absolute is thericher for every discord and for all the diversity which it embraces,' says F. H. Bradley (Appearance and Reality, 204).He means that these slain men make the universe richer, and that is philosophy. But while Professor Royce andBradley and a whole host of guileless thoroughfed thinkers are unveiling Reality and the Absolute and explainingaway evil and pain, this is the condition of the only beings known to us anywhere in the universe with a developedconsciousness of what the universe is. What these people experience is Reality. It gives us an absolute phase of theuniverse. It is the personal experience of those best qualified in our circle of knowledge to have experience, to tell uswhat is. Now what does thinking about the experience of these persons come to, compared to directly and personallyfeeling it as they feel it? The philosophers are dealing in shades, while those who live and feel know truth. And themind of mankind—not yet the mind of philosophers and of the proprietary class—but of the great mass of the silentlythinking men and feeling men, is coming to this view. They"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP500 hl[01 03 2011 00 37 56]Page 500are judging the universe as they have hitherto permitted the hierophants of religion and learning to judge them. \"This Cleveland workingman, killing his children and himself [another of the cited cases] is one of the elementalstupendous facts of this modern world and of this universe. It cannot be glozed over or minimized away by all thetreatises on God, and Love, and Being, helplessly existing in their monumental vacuity. This is one of the simpleirreducible elements of this world's life, after millions of years of opportunity and twenty centuries of Christ. It is inthe mental world what atoms or sub-atoms are in the physical, primary, indestructible. And what it blazons to man isthe imposture of all philosophy which does not see in such events the consummate factor of all conscious experience.These facts invincibly prove religion a nullity. Man will not give religion two thousand centuries or twenty centuriesmore to try itself and waste human time. Its time is up; its probation is ended; its own record ends it. Mankind has notæons and eternities to spare for trying out discredited systems.\"1Such is the reaction of an empiricist mind upon the rationalist bill of fare. It is an absolute 'No, I thank you.' 'Religion,'says Mr. Swift, 'is like a sleep-walker to whom actual things are blank.' And such, tho possibly less tensely chargedwith feeling, is the verdict of every seriously inquiring amateur in philosophy to-day who turns to the philosophy-professors for the wherewithal to satisfy the fulness of his nature's needs. Empiricist writers give him a materialism,rationalists give him something religious, but to that religion 'actual things are blank.' He becomes thus the judge of usphilosophers. Tender or tough, he finds us wanting. None of us may treat his verdicts disdainfully, for after all, his isthe typically perfect mind, the mind the sum of whose demands is greatest, the mind whose criticisms anddissatisfactions are fatal in the long run.It is at this point that my own solution begins to appear. I offer the oddly-named thing pragmatism as a philosophythat can satisfy both kinds of demand. It can remain religious like the rationalisms, but at the same time, like theempiricisms, it1Morrison I. Swift, Human Submission, Part Second, Philadelphia, Liberty Press, 1905, pp. 4 10."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP501 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 35]Page 501can preserve the richest intimacy with facts. I hope I may be able to leave many of you with as favorable an opinionof it as I preserve myself. Yet, as I am near the end of my hour, I will not introduce pragmatism bodily now. I willbegin with it on the stroke of the clock next time. I prefer at the present moment to return a little on what I have said.If any of you here are professional philosophers, and some of you I know to be such, you will doubtless have felt mydiscourse so far to have been crude in an unpardonable, nay, in an almost incredible degree. Tender-minded andtough-minded, what a barbaric disjunction! And, in general, when philosophy is all compacted of delicateintellectualities and subtleties and scrupulosities, and when every possible sort of combination and transition obtainswithin its bounds, what a brutal caricature and reduction of highest things to the lowest possible expression is it torepresent its field of conflict as a sort of rough-and-tumble fight between two hostile temperaments! What achildishly external view! And again, how stupid it is to treat the abstractness of rationalist systems as a crime, and todamn them because they offer themselves as sanctuaries and places of escape, rather than as prolongations of theworld of facts. Are not all our theories just remedies and places of escape? And, if philosophy is to be religious, howcan she be anything else than a place of escape from the crassness of reality's surface? What better thing can she dothan raise us out of our animal senses and show us another and a nobler home for our minds in that great frameworkof ideal principles subtending all reality, which the intellect divines? How can principles and general views ever beanything but abstract outlines? Was Cologne cathedral built without an architect's plan on paper? Is refinement initself an abomination? Is concrete rudeness the only thing that's true?Believe me, I feel the full force of the indictment. The picture I have given is indeed monstrously over-simplified andrude. But like all abstractions, it will prove to have its use. If philosophers can treat the life of the universe abstractly,they must not complain of an abstract treatment of the life of philosophy itself. In point of fact the picture I havegiven is, however coarse and sketchy, literally true.

The details of systems may be reasoned out piecemeal, and when the student is working at asystem, he may often forget the forest for the single tree. But when the labor is accomplished, the mind alwaysperforms its big summarizing act, and the system forthwith stands over against one like a living thing, with thatstrange simple note of individuality which haunts our memory, like the wraith of the man, when a friend or enemy ofours is dead.Not only Walt Whitman could write 'who touches this book touches a man.' The books of all the great philosophersare like so many men. Our sense of an essential personal flavor in each one of them, typical but indescribable, is thefinest fruit of our own accomplished philosophic education. What the system pretends to be is a picture of the greatuniverse of God. What it is,—and oh so flagrantly!—is the revelation of how intensely odd the personal flavor ofsome fellow creature is. Once reduced to these terms (and all our philosophies get reduced to them in minds madecritical by learning) our commerce with the systems reverts to the informal, to the instinctive human reaction ofsatisfaction or dislike. We grow as peremptory in our rejection or admission, as when a person presents himself as acandidate for our favor; our verdicts are couched in as simple adjectives of praise or dispraise. We measure the totalcharacter of the universe as we feel it, against the flavor of the philosophy proffered us, and one word is enough.'Statt der lebendigen Natur,' we say, 'da Gott die Menschen schuf hinein,'—that nebulous concoction, that wooden, thatstraight-laced thing, that crabbed artificiality, that musty schoolroom product, that sick man's dream! Away with it.Away with all of them! Impossible! Impossible!Our work over the details of his system is indeed what gives us our resultant impression of the philosopher, but it ison the resultant impression itself that we react. Expertness in philosophy is measured by the definiteness of oursummarizing reactions, by the immediate perceptive epithet with which the expert hits such complex objects off. Butgreat expertness is not necessary for the epithet to come. Few people have definitely articulated philosophies of theirown. But almost"},{"pageNumber":538,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP503 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 38]Page 503every one has his own peculiar sense of a certain total character in the universe, and of the inadequacy fully to matchit of the peculiar systems that he knows. They don't just cover his world. One will be too dapper, another too pedantic,a third too much of a job-lot of opinions, a fourth too morbid, and a fifth too artificial, or what not. At any rate heand we know off-hand that such philosophies are out of plumb and out of key and out of 'whack,' and have nobusiness to speak up in the universe's name. Plato, Locke, Spinoza, Mill, Caird, Hegel—I prudently avoid namesnearer home!—I am sure that to many of you, my hearers, these names are little more than reminders of as manycurious personal ways of falling short. It would be an obvious absurdity if such ways of taking the universe wereactually true.We philosophers have to reckon with such feelings on your part. In the last resort, I repeat, it will be by them that allour philosophies shall ultimately be judged. The finally victorious way of looking at things will be the mostcompletely impressive way to the normal run of minds.One word more—namely about philosophies necessarily being abstract outlines. There are outlines and outlines,outlines of buildings that are fat, conceived in the cube by their planner, and outlines of buildings invented flat onpaper, with the aid of ruler and compass. These remain skinny and emaciated even when set up in stone and mortar,and the outline already suggests that result. An outline in itself is meagre, truly, but it does not necessarily suggest ameagre thing. It is the essential meagreness of what is suggested by the usual rationalistic philosophies that movesempiricists to their gesture of rejection. The case of Herbert Spencer's system is much to the point here. Rationalistsfeel his fearful array of insufficiencies. His dry schoolmaster temperament, the hurdy-gurdy monotony of him, hispreference for cheap makeshifts in argument, his lack of education even in mechanical principles, and in general thevagueness of all his fundamental ideas, his whole system wooden, as if knocked together out of cracked hemlockboards—and yet the half of England wants to bury him in Westminster Abbey.Why?

His principles may be all skin and bone, butat any rate his books try to mould themselves upon the particular shape of this particular world's carcase. The noise offacts resounds through all his chapters, the citations of fact never cease, he emphasizes facts, turns his face towardstheir quarter; and that is enough. It means the right kind of thing for the empiricist mind.The pragmatistic philosophy of which I hope to begin talking in my next lecture preserves as cordial a relation withfacts, and, unlike Spencer's philosophy, it neither begins nor ends by turning positive religious constructions out ofdoors—it treats them cordially as well.I hope I may lead you to find it just the mediating way of thinking that you require."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP505 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 41]Page 505Lecture IIWhat Pragmatism MeansSome years ago, being with a camping party in the mountains, I returned from a solitary ramble to find every oneengaged in a ferocious metaphysical dispute. The corpus of the dispute was a squirrel—a live squirrel supposed to beclinging to one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the tree's opposite side a human being was imagined to stand.This human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how fast he goes,the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction, and always keeps the tree between himself and the man, so thatnever a glimpse of him is caught. The resultant metaphysical problem now is this: Does the man go round the squirrelor not? He goes round the tree, sure enough, and the squirrel is on the tree; but does he go round the squirrel? In theunlimited leisure of the wilderness, discussion had been worn threadbare. Every one had taken sides, and wasobstinate; and the numbers on both sides were even. Each side, when I appeared therefore appealed to me to make it amajority. Mindful of the scholastic adage that whenever you meet a contradiction you must make a distinction, Iimmediately sought and found one, as follows: \"Which party is right,\" I said, \"depends on what you practically meanby 'going round' the squirrel. If you mean passing from the north of him to the east, then to the south, then to the west,and then to the north of him again, obviously the man does go round him, for he occupies these successive positions.But if on the contrary you mean being first in front of him, then on the right of him, then behind him, then on his left,and finally in front again, it is quite as obvious that the man fails to go round him, for by the compensating movementsthe squirrel makes, he keeps his belly turned towards the man all the time, and his back turned away. Make thedistinction, and there is no occasion for any farther dispute. You are both right and both wrong according as youconceive the verb 'to go round' in one practical fashion or the other.\""},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP506 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 43]Page 506Although one or two of the hotter disputants called my speech a shuffling evasion, saying they wanted no quibbling orscholastic hair-splitting, but meant just plain honest English 'round,' the majority seemed to think that the distinctionhad assuaged the dispute.I tell this trivial anecdote because it is a peculiarly simple example of what I wish now to speak of as the pragmaticmethod. The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might beinterminable. Is the world one or many?—fated or free?—material or spiritual?—here are notions either of whichmay or may not hold good of the world; and disputes over such notions are unending. The pragmatic method in suchcases is to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences. What difference would itpractically make to any one if this notion rather than that notion were true? If no practical difference whatever can betraced, then the alternatives mean practically the same thing, and all dispute is idle. Whenever a dispute is serious, weought to be able to show some practical difference that must follow from one side or the other's being right.A glance at the history of the idea will show you still better what pragmatism means. The term is derived from thesame Greek word pragma, meaning action, from which our words 'practice' and 'practical' come. It was firstintroduced into philosophy by Mr. Charles Peirce in 1878. In an article entitled 'How to Make Our Ideas Clear,' in the'Popular Science Monthly' for January of that year1 Mr. Peirce, after pointing out that our beliefs are really rules foraction, said that, to develop a thought's meaning, we need only determine what conduct it is fitted to produce: thatconduct is for us its sole significance. And the tangible fact at the root of all our thought-distinctions, however subtle,is that there is no one of them so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice. To attain perfectclearness in our thoughts of an object, then, we need only consider what conceivable effects of a practical kind theobject may involve—what sensations we are to expect from it, and what reactions we must1Translated in the Revue Philosophique for January, 1879 (vol. vii)."},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP507 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 44]Page 507prepare. Our conception of these effects, whether immediate or remote, is then for us the whole of our conception ofthe object, so far as that conception has positive significance at all.This is the principle of Peirce, the principle of pragmatism. It lay entirely unnoticed by any one for twenty years, untilI, in an address before Professor Howison's philosophical union at the university of California, brought it forwardagain and made a special application of it to religion. By that date (1898) the times seemed ripe for its reception. Theword 'pragmatism' spread, and at present it fairly spots the pages of the philosophic journals. On all hands we find the'pragmatic movement' spoken of, sometimes with respect, sometimes with contumely, seldom with clearunderstanding. It is evident that the term applies itself conveniently to a number of tendencies that hitherto havelacked a collective name, and that it has 'come to stay.'To take in the importance of Peirce's principle, one must get accustomed to applying it to concrete cases. I found afew years ago that Ostwald, the illustrious Leipzig chemist, had been making perfectly distinct use of the principle ofpragmatism in his lectures on the philosophy of science, though he had not called it by that name.''All realities influence our practice,\" he wrote me, \"and that influence is their meaning for us. I am accustomed to putquestions to my classes in this way: In what respects would the world be different if this alternative or that were true?If I can find nothing that would become different, then the alternative has no sense.\"That is, the rival views mean practically the same thing, and meaning, other than practical, there is for us none.Ostwald in a published lecture gives this example of what he means. Chemists have long wrangled over the innerconstitution of certain bodies called 'tautomerous.' Their properties seemed equally consistent with the notion that aninstable hydrogen atom oscillates inside of them, or that they are instable mixtures of two bodies. Controversy raged,but never was decided. \"It would never have begun,\" says Ostwald, \"if the combatants had asked themselves whatparticular experimental fact could have been made different by one or the other"},{"pageNumber":543,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP508 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 45]Page 508view being correct. For it would then have appeared that no difference of fact could possibly ensue; and the quarrelwas as unreal as if, theorizing in primitive times about the raising of dough by yeast, one party should have invoked a'brownie,' while another insisted on an 'elf' as the true cause of the phenomenon.\"1It is astonishing to see how many philosophical disputes collapse into insignificance the moment you subject them tothis simple test of tracing a concrete consequence. There can be no difference anywhere that does n't make adifference else-where—no difference in abstract truth that does n't express itself in a difference in concrete fact and inconduct consequent upon that fact, imposed on somebody, somehow, somewhere, and somewhen. The whole functionof philosophy ought to be to find out what definite difference it will make to you and me, at definite instants of ourlife, if this world-formula or that world-formula be the true one.There is absolutely nothing new in the pragmatic method. Socrates was an adept at it. Aristotle used it methodically.Locke, Berkeley, and Hume made momentous contributions to truth by its means. Shadworth Hodgson keeps insistingthat realities are only what they are 'known as.' But these forerunners of pragmatism used it in fragments: they werepreluders only. Not until in our time has it generalized itself, become conscious of a universal mission, pretended to aconquering destiny. I believe in that destiny, and I hope I may end by inspiring you with my belief.Pragmatism represents a perfectly familiar attitude in philosophy, the empiricist attitude, but it represents it, as itseems to me, both in a more radical and in a less objectionable form than it has ever yet assumed. A pragmatist turnshis back resolutely and once for all upon a lot of inveterate habits dear to professional philosophers. He turns awayfrom ab-1'Theorie und Praxis,' Zeitsch. des Oesterreichischen Ingenieur u. Architecten-Vereines, 1905, Nr. 4 u. 6. I find a still more radicalpragmatism than Ostwald's in an address by Professor W. S. Franklin: \"I think that the sickliest notion of physics, even if a student getsit, is that it is 'the science of masses, molecules, and the ether.' And I think that the healthiest notion, even if a student does not wholly getit, is that physics is the science of the ways of taking hold of bodies and pushing them!\" (Science, January 2, 1903.)"},{"pageNumber":544,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP509 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 47]Page 509straction and insufficiency, from verbal solutions, from bad a priori reasons, from fixed principles, closed systems,and pretended absolutes and origins. He turns towards concreteness and adequacy, towards facts, towards action andtowards power. That means the empiricist temper regnant and the rationalist temper sincerely given up. It means theopen air and possibilities of nature, as against dogma, artificiality, and the pretence of finality in truth.At the same time it does not stand for any special results. It is a method only. But the general triumph of that methodwould mean an enormous change in what I called in my last lecture the 'temperament' of philosophy. Teachers of theultra-rationalistic type would be frozen out, much as the courtier type is frozen out in republics, as the ultramontanetype of priest is frozen out in protestant lands. Science and metaphysics would come much nearer together, would infact work absolutely hand in hand.Metaphysics has usually followed a very primitive kind of quest. You know how men have always hankered afterunlawful magic, and you know what a great part in magic words have always played. If you have his name, or theformula of incantation that binds him, you can control the spirit, genie, afrite, or whatever the power may be. Solomonknew the names of all the spirits, and having their names, he held them subject to his will. So the universe has alwaysappeared to the natural mind as a kind of enigma, of which the key must be sought in the shape of some illuminatingor power-bringing word or name. That word names the universe's principle, and to possess it is after a fashion topossess the universe itself. 'God,' 'Matter,' 'Reason,' 'the Absolute,' 'Energy,' are so many solving names. You can restwhen you have them. You are at the end of your metaphysical quest.But if you follow the pragmatic method, you cannot look on any such word as closing your quest. You must bring outof each word its practical cash-value, set it at work within the stream of your experience. It appears less as a solution,then, than as a program for more work, and more particularly as an indication of the ways in which existing realitiesmay be changed.Theories thus become instruments, not answers to enigmas, in"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP510 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 48]Page 510which we can rest. We don't lie back upon them, we move forward, and, on occasion, make nature over again by theiraid. Pragmatism unstiffens all our theories, limbers them up and sets each one at work. Being nothing essentially new,it harmonizes with many ancient philosophic tendencies. It agrees with nominalism for instance, in always appealingto particulars; with utilitarianism in emphasizing practical aspects; with positivism in its disdain for verbal solutions,useless questions and metaphysical abstractions.All these, you see, are anti-intellectualist tendencies. Against rationalism as a pretension and a method pragmatism isfully armed and militant. But, at the outset, at least, it stands for no particular results. It has no dogmas, and nodoctrines save its method. As the young Italian pragmatist Papini has well said, it lies in the midst of our theories, likea corridor in a hotel. Innumerable chambers open out of it. In one you may find a man writing an atheistic volume; inthe next some one on his knees praying for faith and strength; in a third a chemist investigating a body's properties. Ina fourth a system of idealistic metaphysics is being excogitated; in a fifth the impossibility of metaphysics is beingshown. But they all own the corridor, and all must pass through it if they want a practicable way of getting into or outof their respective rooms.No particular results then, so far, but only an attitude of orientation, is what the pragmatic method means. The attitudeof looking away from first things, principles, 'categories,' supposed necessities; and of looking towards last things,fruits, consequences, facts.So much for the pragmatic method! You may say that I have been praising it rather than explaining it to you, but Ishall presently explain it abundantly enough by showing how it works on some familiar problems. Meanwhile theword pragmatism has come to be used in a still wider sense, as meaning also a certain theory of truth. I mean to givea whole lecture to the statement of that theory, after first paving the way, so I can be very brief now. But brevity ishard to follow, so I ask for your redoubled attention for a quarter of an hour. If much remains obscure, I hope to makeit clearer in the later lectures."},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP511 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 49]Page 511One of the most successfully cultivated branches of philosophy in our time is what is called inductive logic, the studyof the conditions under which our sciences have evolved. Writers on this subject have begun to show a singularunanimity as to what the laws of nature and elements of fact mean, when formulated by mathematicians, physicistsand chemists. When the first mathematical, logical, and natural uniformities, the first laws, were discovered, menwere so carried away by the clearness, beauty and simplification that resulted, that they believed themselves to havedeciphered authentically the eternal thoughts of the Almighty. His mind also thundered and reverberated insyllogisms. He also thought in conic sections, squares and roots and ratios, and geometrized like Euclid. He madeKepler's laws for the planets to follow; he made velocity increase proportionally to the time in falling bodies; he madethe law of the sines for light to obey when refracted; he established the classes, orders, families and genera of plantsand animals, and fixed the distances between them. He thought the archetypes of all things, and devised theirvariations; and when we rediscover any one of these his wondrous institutions, we seize his mind in its very literalintention.But as the sciences have developed farther, the notion has gained ground that most, perhaps all, of our laws are onlyapproximations. The laws themselves, moreover, have grown so numerous that there is no counting them; and somany rival formulations are proposed in all the branches of science that investigators have become accustomed to thenotion that no theory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but that any one of them may from some point of view beuseful. Their great use is to summarize old facts and to lead to new ones. They are only a man-made language, aconceptual shorthand, as some one calls them, in which we write our reports of nature; and languages, as is wellknown, tolerate much choice of expression and many dialects.Thus human arbitrariness has driven divine necessity from scientific logic. If I mention the names of Sigwart, Mach,Ostwald, Pearson, Milhaud, Poincaré, Duhem, Ruyssen, those of you who are students will easily identify thetendency I speak of, and will think of additional names."},{"pageNumber":547,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP512 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 51]Page 512Riding now on the front of this wave of scientific logic Messrs. Schiller and Dewey appear with their pragmatisticaccount of what truth everywhere signifies. Everywhere, these teachers say, 'truth' in our ideas and beliefs means thesame thing that it means in science. It means, they say, nothing but this, that ideas (which themselves are but parts ofour experience) become true just in so far as they help us to get into satisfactory relation with other parts of ourexperience, to summarize them and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts instead of following theinterminable succession of particular phenomena. Any idea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that willcarry us prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, workingsecurely, simplifying, saving labor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true instrumentally. This is the'instrumental' view of truth taught so successfully at Chicago, the view that truth in our ideas means their power to'work,' promulgated so brilliantly at Oxford.Messrs. Dewey, Schiller and their allies, in reaching this general conception of all truth, have only followed theexample of geologists, biologists and philologists. In the establishment of these other sciences, the successful strokewas always to take some simple process actually observable in operation—as denudation by weather, say, or variationfrom parental type, or change of dialect by incorporation of new words and pronunciations—and then to generalize it,making it apply to all times, and produce great results by summating its effects through the ages.The observable process which Schiller and Dewey particularly singled out for generalization is the familiar one bywhich any individual settles into new opinions. The process here is always the same. The individual has a stock of oldopinions already, but he meets a new experience that puts them to a strain. Somebody contradicts them; or in areflective moment he discovers that they contradict each other; or he hears of facts with which they are incompatible;or desires arise in him which they cease to satisfy. The result is an inward trouble to which his mind till then had beena stranger, and from which he seeks to escape by modifying his previous mass of opinions. He saves as much of it ashe can, for in this"},{"pageNumber":548,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP513 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 52]Page 513matter of belief we are all extreme conservatives. So he tries to change first this opinion, and then that (for they resistchange very variously), until at last some new idea comes up which he can graft upon the ancient stock with aminimum of disturbance of the latter, some idea that mediates between the stock and the new experience and runsthem into one another most felicitously and expediently.This new idea is then adopted as the true one. It preserves the older stock of truths with a minimum of modification,stretching them just enough to make them admit the novelty, but conceiving that in ways as familiar as the case leavespossible. An outrée explanation, violating all our preconceptions, would never pass for a true account of a novelty. Weshould scratch round industriously till we found something less excentric. The most violent revolutions in anindividual's beliefs leave most of his old order standing. Time and space, cause and effect, nature and history, andone's own biography remain untouched. New truth is always a go-between, a smoother-over of transitions. It marriesold opinion to new fact so as ever to show a minimum of jolt, a maximum of continuity. We hold a theory true just inproportion to its success in solving this 'problem of maxima and minima.' But success in solving this problem iseminently a matter of approximation. We say this theory solves it on the whole more satisfactorily than that theory;but that means more satisfactorily to ourselves, and individuals will emphasize their points of satisfaction differently.To a certain degree, therefore, everything here is plastic.The point I now urge you to observe particularly is the part played by the older truths. Failure to take account of it isthe source of much of the unjust criticism levelled against pragmatism. Their influence is absolutely controlling.Loyalty to them is the first principle—in most cases it is the only principle; for by far the most usual way of handlingphenomena so novel that they would make for a serious rearrangement of our preconceptions is to ignore themaltogether, or to abuse those who bear witness for them.You doubtless wish examples of this process of truth's growth, and the only trouble is their superabundance. Thesimplest case of new truth is of course the mere numerical"},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP514 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 53]Page 514addition of new kinds of facts, or of new single facts of old kinds, to our experience—an addition that involves noalteration in the old beliefs. Day follows day, and its contents are simply added. The new contents themselves are nottrue, they simply come and are. Truth is what we say about them, and when we say that they have come, truth issatisfied by the plain additive formula.But often the day's contents oblige a rearrangement. If I should now utter piercing shrieks and act like a maniac onthis platform, it would make many of you revise your ideas as to the probable worth of my philosophy. 'Radium' camethe other day as part of the day's content, and seemed for a moment to contradict our ideas of the whole order ofnature, that order having come to be identified with what is called the conservation of energy. The mere sight ofradium paying heat away indefinitely out of its own pocket seemed to violate that conservation. What to think? If theradiations from it were nothing but an escape of unsuspected 'potential' energy, pre-existent inside of the atoms, theprinciple of conservation would be saved. The discovery of 'helium' as the radiation's outcome, opened a way to thisbelief. So Ramsay's view is generally held to be true, because, although it extends our old ideas of energy, it causes aminimum of alteration in their nature.I need not multiply instances. A new opinion counts as 'true' just in proportion as it gratifies the individual's desire toassimilate the novel in his experience to his beliefs in stock. It must both lean on old truth and grasp new fact; and itssuccess (as I said a moment ago) in doing this, is a matter for the individual's appreciation. When old truth grows,then, by new truth's addition, it is for subjective reasons. We are in the process and obey the reasons. That new idea istruest which performs most felicitously its function of satisfying our double urgency. It makes itself true, gets itselfclassed as true, by the way it works; grafting itself then upon the ancient body of truth, which thus grows much as atree grows by the activity of a new layer of cambium.Now Dewey and Schiller proceed to generalize this observation and to apply it to the most ancient parts of truth. Theyalso once were plastic. They also were called true for human"},{"pageNumber":550,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP515 hl[01 03 2011 01 36 54]Page 515reasons. They also mediated between still earlier truths and what in those days were novel observations. Purelyobjective truth, truth in whose establishment the function of giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts ofexperience with newer parts played no rôle whatever, is nowhere to be found. The reasons why we call things true isthe reason why they are true, for 'to be true' means only to perform this marriage-function.The trail of the human serpent is thus over everything. Truth independent; truth that we find merely; truth no longermalleable to human need; truth incorrigible, in a word; such truth exists indeed superabundantly—or is supposed toexist by rationalistically minded thinkers; but then it means only the dead heart of the living tree, and its being theremeans only that truth also has its paleontology and its 'prescription,' and may grow stiff with years of veteran serviceand petrified in men's regard by sheer antiquity. But how plastic even the oldest truths nevertheless really are has beenvividly shown in our day by the transformation of logical and mathematical ideas, a transformation which seems evento be invading physics. The ancient formulas are reinterpreted as special expressions of much wider principles,principles that our ancestors never got a glimpse of in their present shape and formulation.Mr. Schiller still gives to all this view of truth the name of 'Humanism,' but, for this doctrine too, the name ofpragmatism seems fairly to be in the ascendant, so I will treat it under the name of pragmatism in these lectures.Such then would be the scope of pragmatism—first, a method; and second, a genetic theory of what is meant by truth.And these two things must be our future topics.What I have said of the theory of truth will, I am sure, have appeared obscure and unsatisfactory to most of you byreason of its brevity. I shall make amends for that hereafter. In a lecture on 'common sense' I shall try to show what Imean by truths grown petrified by antiquity. In another lecture I shall expatiate on the idea that our thoughts becometrue in proportion as they successfully exert their go-between function. In a third I shall show how hard it is todiscriminate subjective from objective factors in Truth's development. You may"},{"pageNumber":551,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP516 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 11]Page 516not follow me wholly in these lectures; and if you do, you may not wholly agree with me. But you will, I know, regardme at least as serious, and treat my effort with respectful consideration.You will probably be surprised to learn, then, that Messrs. Schiller's and Dewey's theories have suffered a hailstorm ofcontempt and ridicule. All rationalism has risen against them. In influential quarters Mr. Schiller, in particular, hasbeen treated like an impudent schoolboy who deserves a spanking. I should not mention this, but for the fact that itthrows so much sidelight upon that rationalistic temper to which I have opposed the temper of pragmatism.Pragmatism is uncomfortable away from facts. Rationalism is comfortable only in the presence of abstractions. Thispragmatist talk about truths in the plural, about their utility and satisfactoriness, about the success with which they'work,' etc., suggests to the typical intellectualist mind a sort of coarse lame second-rate make-shift article of truth.Such truths are not real truth. Such tests are merely subjective. As against this, objective truth must be something non-utilitarian, haughty, refined, remote, august, exalted. It must be an absolute correspondence of our thoughts with anequally absolute reality. It must be what we ought to think unconditionally. The conditioned ways in which we dothink are so much irrelevance and matter for psychology. Down with psychology, up with logic, in all this question!See the exquisite contrast of the types of mind! The pragmatist clings to facts and concreteness, observes truth at itswork in particular cases, and generalizes. Truth, for him, becomes a class-name for all sorts of definite working-valuesin experience. For the rationalist it remains a pure abstraction, to the bare name of which we must defer. When thepragmatist undertakes to show in detail just why we must defer, the rationalist is unable to recognize the concretesfrom which his own abstraction is taken. He accuses us of denying truth; whereas we have only sought to traceexactly why people follow it and always ought to follow it. Your typical ultra-abstractionist fairly shudders atconcreteness: other things equal, he positively prefers the pale and spectral. If the two universes were offered, hewould always choose the skinny outline"},{"pageNumber":552,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP517 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 12]Page 517rather than the rich thicket of reality. It is so much purer, clearer, nobler.I hope that as these lectures go on, the concreteness and closeness to facts of the pragmatism which they advocate maybe what approves itself to you as its most satisfactory peculiarity. It only follows here the example of the sister-sciences, interpreting the unobserved by the observed. It brings old and new harmoniously together. It converts theabsolutely empty notion of a static relation of 'correspondence' (what that may mean we must ask later) between ourminds and reality, into that of a rich and active commerce (that any one may follow in detail and understand) betweenparticular thoughts of ours, and the great universe of other experiences in which they play their parts and have theiruses.But enough of this at present? The justification of what I say must be postponed. I wish now to add a word in furtherexplanation of the claim I made at our last meeting, that pragmatism may be a happy harmonizer of empiricist ways ofthinking with the more religious demands of human beings.Men who are strongly of the fact-loving temperament, you may remember me to have said, are liable to be kept at adistance by the small sympathy with facts which that philosophy from the present-day fashion of idealism offersthem. It is far too intellectualistic. Old fashioned theism was bad enough, with its notion of God as an exaltedmonarch, made up of a lot of unintelligible or preposterous 'attributes'; but, so long as it held strongly by the argumentfrom design, it kept some touch with concrete realities. Since, however, darwinism has once for all displaced designfrom the minds of the 'scientific,' theism has lost that foothold; and some kind of an immanent or pantheistic deityworking in things rather than above them is, if any, the kind recommended to our contemporary imagination.Aspirants to a philosophic religion turn, as a rule, more hopefully nowadays towards idealistic pantheism than towardsthe older dualistic theism, in spite of the fact that the latter still counts able defenders.But, as I said in my first lecture, the brand of pantheism offered is hard for them to assimilate if they are lovers of"},{"pageNumber":553,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP518 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 14]Page 518facts, or empirically minded. It is the absolutistic brand, spurning the dust and reared upon pure logic. It keeps noconnexion whatever with concreteness. Affirming the Absolute Mind, which is its substitute for God, to be the rationalpresupposition of all particulars of fact, whatever they may be, it remains supremely indifferent to what the particularfacts in our world actually are. Be they what they may, the Absolute will father them. Like the sick lion in Esop'sfable, all footprints lead into his den, but nulla vestigia retrorsum. You cannot redescend into the world of particularsby the Absolute's aid, or deduce any necessary consequences of detail important for your life from your idea of hisnature. He gives you indeed the assurance that all is well with Him, and for his eternal way of thinking; but thereuponhe leaves you to be finitely saved by your own temporal devices.Far be it from me to deny the majesty of this conception, or its capacity to yield religious comfort to a mostrespectable class of minds. But from the human point of view, no one can pretend that it does n't suffer from the faultsof remoteness and abstractness. It is eminently a product of what I have ventured to call the rationalistic temper. Itdisdains empiricism's needs. It substitutes a pallid outline for the real world's richness. It is dapper, it is noble in thebad sense, in the sense in which to be noble is to be inapt for humble service. In this real world of sweat and dirt, itseems to me that when a view of things is 'noble,' that ought to count as a presumption against its truth, and as aphilosophic disqualification. The prince of darkness may be a gentleman, as we are told he is, but whatever the God ofearth and heaven is, he can surely be no gentleman. His menial services are needed in the dust of our human trials,even more than his dignity is needed in the empyrean.Now pragmatism, devoted though she be to facts, has no such materialistic bias as ordinary empiricism labors under.Moreover, she has no objection whatever to the realizing of abstractions, so long as you get about among particularswith their aid and they actually carry you somewhere. Interested in no conclusions but those which our minds and ourexperiences work out together, she has no a priori prejudices against theology. If theological ideas prove to have avalue for concrete"},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP519 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 15]Page 519life, they will be true, for pragmatism, in the sense of being good for so much. For how much more they are true, willdepend entirely on their relations to the other truths that also have to be acknowledged.What I said just now about the Absolute of transcendental idealism is a case in point. First, I called it majestic andsaid it yielded religious comfort to a class of minds, and then I accused it of remoteness and sterility. But so far as itaffords such comfort, it surely is not sterile; it has that amount of value; it performs a concrete function. As a goodpragmatist, I myself ought to call the Absolute true 'in so far forth,' then; and I unhesitatingly now do so.But what does true in so far forth mean in this case? To answer, we need only apply the pragmatic method. What dobelievers in the Absolute mean by saying that their belief affords them comfort? They mean that since in the Absolutefinite evil is 'overruled' already, we may, therefore, whenever we wish, treat the temporal as if it were potentially theeternal, be sure that we can trust its outcome, and, without sin, dismiss our fear and drop the worry of our finiteresponsibility. In short, they mean that we have a right ever and anon to take a moral holiday, to let the world wag inits own way, feeling that its issues are in better hands than ours and are none of our business.The universe is a system of which the individual members may relax their anxieties occasionally, in which the don't-care mood is also right for men, and moral holidays in order,—that, if I mistake not, is part, at least, of what theAbsolute is 'known-as,' that is the great difference in our particular experiences which his being true makes, for us,that is part of his cash-value when he is pragmatically interpreted. Farther than that the ordinary lay-reader inphilosophy who thinks favorably of absolute idealism does not venture to sharpen his conceptions. He can use theAbsolute for so much, and so much is very precious. He is pained at hearing you speak incredulously of the Absolute,therefore, and disregards your criticisms because they deal with aspects of the conception that he fails to follow.If the Absolute means this, and means no more than this, who can possibly deny the truth of it? To deny it would be"},{"pageNumber":555,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP520 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 16]Page 520to insist that men should never relax, and that holidays are never in order.I am well aware how odd it must seem to some of you to hear me say that an idea is 'true' so long as to believe it isprofitable to our lives. That it is good, for as much as it profits, you will gladly admit. If what we do by its aid is good,you will allow the idea itself to be good in so far forth, for we are the better for possessing it. But is it not a strangemisuse of the word 'truth,' you will say, to call ideas also 'true' for this reason?To answer this difficulty fully is impossible at this stage of my account. You touch here upon the very central point ofMessrs. Schiller's, Dewey's and my own doctrine of truth, which I can not discuss with detail until my sixth lecture.Let me now say only this, that truth is one species of good, and not, as is usually supposed, a category distinct fromgood, and coordinate with it. The true is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief, and good,too, for definite, assignable reasons. Surely you must admit this, that if there were no good for life in true ideas, or ifthe knowledge of them were positively disadvantageous and false ideas the only useful ones, then the current notionthat truth is divine and precious, and its pursuit a duty, could never have grown up or become a dogma. In a worldlike that, our duty would be to shun truth, rather. But in this world, just as certain foods are not only agreeable to ourtaste, but good for our teeth, our stomach, and our tissues; so certain ideas are not only agreeable to think about, oragreeable as supporting other ideas that we are fond of, but they are also helpful in life's practical struggles. If there beany life that it is really better we should lead, and if there be any idea which, if believed in, would help us to lead thatlife, then it would be really better for us to believe in that idea, unless, indeed, belief in it incidentally clashed withother greater vital benefits.'What would be better for us to believe'! This sounds very like a definition of truth. It comes very near to saying 'whatwe ought to believe': and in that definition none of you would find any oddity. Ought we ever not to believe what it isbetter for us to believe? And can we then keep the notion of what is better for us, and what is true for us, permanentlyapart?"},{"pageNumber":556,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP521 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 17]Page 521Pragmatism says no, and I fully agree with her. Probably you also agree, so far as the abstract statement goes, but witha suspicion that if we practically did believe everything that made for good in our own personal lives, we should befound indulging all kinds of fancies about this world's affairs, and all kinds of sentimental superstitions about a worldhereafter. Your suspicion here is undoubtedly well founded, and it is evident that something happens when you passfrom the abstract to the concrete that complicates the situation.I said just now that what is better for us to believe is true unless the belief incidentally clashes with some other vitalbenefit. Now in real life what vital benefits is any particular belief of ours most liable to clash with? What indeedexcept the vital benefits yielded by other beliefs when these prove incompatible with the first ones? In other words,the greatest enemy of any one of our truths may be the rest of our truths. Truths have once for all this desperateinstinct of self-preservation and of desire to extinguish whatever contradicts them. My belief in the Absolute, basedon the good it does me, must run the gauntlet of all my other beliefs. Grant that it may be true in giving me a moralholiday. Nevertheless, as I conceive it,—and let me speak now confidentially, as it were, and merely in my ownprivate person,—it clashes with other truths of mine whose benefits I hate to give up on its account. It happens to beassociated with a kind of logic of which I am the enemy, I find that it entangles me in metaphysical paradoxes that areinacceptable, etc., etc. But as I have enough trouble in life already without adding the trouble of carrying theseintellectual inconsistencies, I personally just give up the Absolute. I just take my moral holidays; or else as aprofessional philosopher, I try to justify them by some other principle.If I could restrict my notion of the Absolute to its bare holiday-giving value, it would n't clash with my other truths.But we can not easily thus restrict our hypotheses. They carry supernumerary features, and these it is that clash so. Mydisbelief in the Absolute means then disbelief in those other supernumerary features, for I fully believe in thelegitimacy of taking moral holidays.You see by this what I meant when I called pragmatism a mediator and reconciler and said, borrowing the word from"},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP522 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 19]Page 522Papini, that she 'unstiffens' our theories. She has in fact no prejudices whatever, no obstructive dogmas, no rigidcanons of what shall count as proof. She is completely genial. She will entertain any hypothesis, she will consider anyevidence. It follows that in the religious field she is at a great advantage both over positivistic empiricism, with itsanti-theological bias, and over religious rationalism, with its exclusive interest in the remote, the noble, the simple,and the abstract in the way of conception.In short, she widens the field of search for God. Rationalism sticks to logic and the empyrean. Empiricism sticks tothe external senses. Pragmatism is willing to take anything, to follow either logic or the senses and to count thehumblest and most personal experiences. She will count mystical experiences if they have practical consequences. Shewill take a God who lives in the very dirt of private fact—if that should seem a likely place to find him.Her only test of probable truth is what works best in the way of leading us, what fits every part of life best andcombines with the collectivity of experience's demands, nothing being omitted. If theological ideas should do this, ifthe notion of God, in particular, should prove to do it, how could pragmatism possibly deny God's existence? Shecould see no meaning in treating as 'not true' a notion that was pragmatically so successful. What other kind of truthcould there be, for her, than all this agreement with concrete reality?In my last lecture I shall return again to the relations of pragmatism with religion. But you see already howdemocratic she is. Her manners are as various and flexible, her resources as rich and endless, and her conclusions asfriendly as those of mother nature."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP523 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 20]Page 523Lecture IIISome Metaphysical Problems Pragmatically ConsideredI am now to make the pragmatic method more familiar by giving you some illustrations of its application to particularproblems. I will begin with what is driest, and the first thing I shall take will be the problem of Substance. Every oneuses the old distinction between substance and attribute, enshrined as it is in the very structure of human language, inthe difference between grammatical subject and predicate. Here is a bit of blackboard crayon. Its modes, attributes,properties, accidents, or affections,—use which term you will,—are whiteness, friability, cylindrical shape,insolubility in water, etc., etc. But the bearer of these attributes is so much chalk, which thereupon is called thesubstance in which they inhere. So the attributes of this desk inhere in the substance 'wood,' those of my coat in thesubstance 'wool,' and so forth. Chalk, wood and wool, show again, in spite of their differences, common properties,and in so far forth they are themselves counted as modes of a still more primal substance, matter, the attributes ofwhich are space-occupancy and impenetrability. Similarly our thoughts and feelings are affections or properties of ourseveral souls, which are substances, but again not wholly in their own right, for they are modes of the still deepersubstance 'spirit.'Now it was very early seen that all we know of the chalk is the whiteness, friability, etc., all we know of the wood isthe combustibility and fibrous structure. A group of attributes is what each substance here is known-as, they form itssole cash-value for our actual experience. The substance is in every case revealed through them; if we were cut offfrom them we should never suspect its existence; and if God should keep sending them to us in an unchanged order,miraculously annihilating at a certain moment the substance that supported them, we never could detect the moment,for our experiences themselves would be unaltered. Nominalists accordingly adopt the opinion that substance is aspurious idea due to our"},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP524 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 21]Page 524inveterate human trick of turning names into things. Phenomena come in groups—the chalk-group, the wood-group,etc.,—and each group gets its name. The name we then treat as in a way supporting the group of phenomena. The lowthermometer to-day, for instance, is supposed to come from something called the 'climate.' Climate is really only thename for a certain group of days, but it is treated as if it lay behind the day, and in general we place the name, as if itwere a being, behind the facts it is the name of. But the phenomenal properties of things, nominalists say, surely donot really inhere in names, and if not in names then they do not inhere in anything. They adhere, or cohere, rather,with each other, and the notion of a substance inaccessible to us, which we think accounts for such cohesion bysupporting it, as cement might support pieces of mosaic, must be abandoned. The fact of the bare cohesion itself is allthat the notion of the substance signifies. Behind that fact is nothing.Scholasticism has taken the notion of substance from common sense and made it very technical and articulate. Fewthings would seem to have fewer pragmatic consequences for us than substances, cut off as we are from every contactwith them. Yet in one case scholasticism has proved the importance of the substance-idea by treating it pragmatically.I refer to certain disputes about the mystery of the Eucharist. Substance here would appear to have momentouspragmatic value. Since the accidents of the wafer don't change in the Lord's supper, and yet it has become the verybody of Christ, it must be that the change is in the substance solely. The bread-substance must have been withdrawn,and the divine substance substituted miraculously without altering the immediate sensible properties. But tho thesedon't alter, a tremendous difference has been made, no less a one than this, that we who take the sacrament, now feedupon the very substance of divinity. The substance-notion breaks into life, then, with tremendous effect, if once youallow that substances can separate from their accidents, and exchange these latter.This is the only pragmatic application of the substance-idea with which I am acquainted; and it is obvious that it willonly be treated seriously by those who already believe in the 'real presence' on independent grounds."},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP525 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 22]Page 525Material substance was criticised by Berkeley with such telling effect that his name has reverberated through allsubsequent philosophy. Berkeley's treatment of the notion of matter is so well known as to need hardly more than amention. So far from denying the external world which we know, Berkeley corroborated it. It was the scholasticnotion of a material substance unapproachable by us, behind the external world, deeper and more real than it, andneeded to support it, which Berkeley maintained to be the most effective of all reducers of the external world tounreality. Abolish that substance, he said, believe that God, whom you can understand and approach, sends you thesensible world directly, and you confirm the latter and back it up by his divine authority. Berkeley's criticism of'matter' was consequently absolutely pragmatistic. Matter is known as our sensations of colour, figure, hardness andthe like. They are the cash-value of the term. The difference matter makes to us by truly being is that we then get suchsensations; by not being, is that we lack them. These sensations then are its sole meaning. Berkeley does n't denymatter, then; he simply tells us what it consists of. It is a true name for just so much in the way of sensations.Locke, and later Hume, applied a similar pragmatic criticism to the notion of spiritual substance. I will only mentionLocke's treatment of our 'personal identity.' He immediately reduces this notion to its pragmatic value in terms ofexperience. It means, he says, so much 'consciousness,' namely the fact that at one moment of life we remember othermoments, and feel them all as parts of one and the same personal history. Rationalism had explained this practicalcontinuity in our life by the unity of our soul-substance. But Locke says: suppose that God should take away theconsciousness, should we be any the better for having still the soul-principle? Suppose he annexed the sameconsciousness to different souls, should we, as we realize ourselves, be any the worse for that fact? In Locke's day thesoul was chiefly a thing to be rewarded or punished. See how Locke, discussing it from this point of view, keeps thequestion pragmatic:''Suppose,\" he says, \"one to think himself to be the same soul that once was Nestor or Thersites. Can he think theiractions his own any more than the actions of any other man"},{"pageNumber":561,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP526 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 23]Page 526that ever existed? But let him once find himself conscious of any of the actions of Nestor, he then finds himself thesame person with Nestor. In this personal identity is founded all the right and justice of reward and punishment. Itmay be reasonable to think, no one shall be made to answer for what he knows nothing of, but shall receive his doom,his consciousness accusing or excusing. Supposing a man punished now for what he had done in another life, whereofhe could be made to have no consciousness at all, what difference is there between that punishment and being createdmiserable?\"Our personal identity, then, consists, for Locke, solely in pragmatically definable particulars. Whether, apart fromthese verifiable facts, it also inheres in a spiritual principle, is a merely curious speculation. Locke, compromiser thathe was, passively tolerated the belief in a substantial soul behind our consciousness. But his successor Hume, andmost empirical psychologists after him, have denied the soul, save as the name for verifiable cohesions in our innerlife. They redescend into the stream of experience with it, and cash it into so much small-change value in the way of'ideas' and their peculiar connexions with each other. As I said of Berkeley's matter, the soul is good or 'true' for justso much, but no more.The mention of material substance naturally suggests the doctrine of 'materialism,' but philosophical materialism is notnecessarily knit up with belief in 'matter,' as a metaphysical principle. One may deny matter in that sense, as stronglyas Berkeley did, one may be a phenomenalist like Huxley, and yet one may still be a materialist in the wider sense, ofexplaining higher phenomena by lower ones, and leaving the destinies of the world at the mercy of its blinder partsand forces. It is in this wider sense of the word that materialism is opposed to spiritualism or theism. The laws ofphysical nature are what run things, materialism says. The highest productions of human genius might be ciphered byone who had complete acquaintance with the facts, out of their physiological conditions, regardless whether nature bethere only for our minds, as idealists contend, or not. Our minds in any case would have to record the kind of nature itis, and write it down as operating through blind laws of physics. This is the complexion of present day materialism,which may better be"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP527 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 24]Page 527called naturalism. Over against it stands 'theism,' or what in a wide sense may be termed 'spiritualism.' Spiritualismsays that mind not only witnesses and records things, but also runs and operates them: the world being thus guided,not by its lower, but by its higher element.Treated as it often is, this question becomes little more than a conflict between æsthetic preferences. Matter is gross,coarse, crass, muddy; spirit is pure, elevated, noble; and since it is more consonant with the dignity of the universe togive the primacy in it to what appears superior, spirit must be affirmed as the ruling principle. To treat abstractprinciples as finalities, before which our intellects may come to rest in a state of admiring contemplation, is the greatrationalist failing. Spiritualism, as often held, may be simply a state of admiration for one kind, and of dislike foranother kind, of abstraction. I remember a worthy spiritualist professor who always referred to materialism as the'mud-philosophy,' and deemed it thereby refuted.To such spiritualism as this there is an easy answer, and Mr. Spencer makes it effectively. In some well-written pagesat the end of the first volume of his Psychology he shows us that a 'matter' so infinitely subtile, and performingmotions as inconceivably quick and fine as those which modern science postulates in her explanations, has no trace ofgrossness left. He shows that the conception of spirit, as we mortals hitherto have framed it, is itself too gross to coverthe exquisite tenuity of nature's facts. Both terms, he says, are but symbols, pointing to that one unknowable reality inwhich their oppositions cease.To an abstract objection an abstract rejoinder suffices; and so far as one's opposition to materialism springs from one'sdisdain of matter as something 'crass,' Mr. Spencer cuts the ground from under one. Matter is indeed infinitely andincredibly refined. To any one who has ever looked on the face of a dead child or parent the mere fact that mattercould have taken for a time that precious form, ought to make matter sacred ever after. It makes no difference whatthe principle of life may be, material or immaterial, matter at any rate cooperates, lends itself to all life's purposes.That beloved incarnation was among matter's possibilities."},{"pageNumber":563,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP528 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 25]Page 528But now, instead of resting in principles after this stagnant intellectualist fashion, let us apply the pragmatic method tothe question. What do we mean by matter? What practical difference can it make now that the world should be run bymatter or by spirit? I think we find that the problem takes with this a rather different character.And first of all I call your attention to a curious fact. It makes not a single jot of difference so far as the past of theworld goes, whether we deem it to have been the work of matter or whether we think a divine spirit was its author.Imagine, in fact, the entire contents of the world to be once for all irrevocably given. Imagine it to end this verymoment, and to have no future; and then let a theist and a materialist apply their rival explanations to its history. Thetheist shows how a God made it; the materialist shows, and we will suppose with equal success, how it resulted fromblind physical forces. Then let the pragmatist be asked to choose between their theories. How can he apply his test ifthe world is already completed? Concepts for him are things to come back into experience with, things to make uslook for differences. But by hypothesis there is to be no more experience and no possible differences can now belooked for. Both theories have shown all their consequences and, by the hypothesis we are adopting, these areidentical. The pragmatist must consequently say that the two theories, in spite of their different-sounding names, meanexactly the same thing, and that the dispute is purely verbal. [I am supposing, of course, that the theories have beenequally successful in their explanations of what is.]For just consider the case sincerely, and say what would be the worth of a God if he were there, with his workaccomplished and his world run down. He would be worth no more than just that world was worth. To that amount ofresult, with its mixed merits and defects, his creative power could attain but go no farther. And since there is to be nofuture; since the whole value and meaning of the world has been already paid in and actualized in the feelings thatwent with it in the passing, and now go with it in the ending; since it draws no supplemental significance (such as ourreal world draws) from its function of preparing something yet to come;"},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP529 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 26]Page 529why then, by it we take God's measure, as it were. He is the Being who could once for all do that; and for that muchwe are thankful to him, but for nothing more. But now, on the contrary hypothesis, namely, that the bits of matterfollowing their laws could make that world and do no less, should we not be just as thankful to them? Wherein shouldwe suffer loss, then, if we dropped God as an hypothesis and made the matter alone responsible? Where would anyspecial deadness, or crassness, come in? And how, experience being what is once for all, would God's presence in itmake it any more living or richer?Candidly, it is impossible to give any answer to this question. The actually experienced world is supposed to be thesame in its details on either hypothesis, 'the same, for our praise or blame,' as Browning says. It stands thereindefeasibly: a gift which can't be taken back. Calling matter the cause of it retracts no single one of the items thathave made it up, nor does calling God the cause augment them. They are the God or the atoms, respectively, of justthat and no other world. The God, if there, has been doing just what atoms could do—appearing in the character ofatoms, so to speak—and earning such gratitude as is due to atoms, and no more. If his presence lends no different turnor issue to the performance, it surely can lend it no increase of dignity. Nor would indignity come to it were he absent,and did the atoms remain the only actors on the stage. When a play is once over, and the curtain down, you reallymake it no better by claiming an illustrious genius for its author, just as you make it no worse by calling him acommon hack.Thus if no future detail of experience or conduct is to be deducted from our hypothesis, the debate betweenmaterialism and theism becomes quite idle and insignificant. Matter and God in that event mean exactly the samething—the power, namely, neither more nor less, that could make just this completed world—and the wise man is hewho in such a case would turn his back on such a supererogatory discussion. Accordingly, most men instinctively, andpositivists and scientists deliberately, do turn their backs on philosophical disputes from which nothing in the line ofdefinite future consequences can be seen to follow. The verbal and empty"},{"pageNumber":565,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP530 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 28]Page 530character of philosophy is surely a reproach with which we are but too familiar. If pragmatism be true, it is a perfectlysound reproach unless the theories under fire can be shown to have alternative practical outcomes, however delicateand distant these may be. The common man and the scientist say they discover no such outcomes, and if themetaphysician can discern none either, the others certainly are in the right of it, as against him. His science is then butpompous trifling; and the endowment of a professorship for such a being would be silly.Accordingly, in every genuine metaphysical debate some practical issue, however conjectural and remote, is involved.To realize this, revert with me to our question, and place yourselves this time in the world we live in, in the world thathas a future, that is yet uncompleted whilst we speak. In this unfinished world the alternative of 'materialism ortheism?' is intensely practical; and it is worth while for us to spend some minutes of our hour in seeing that it is so.How, indeed, does the program differ for us, according as we consider that the facts of experience up to date arepurposeless configurations of blind atoms moving according to eternal laws, or that on the other hand they are due tothe providence of God? As far as the past facts go, indeed, there is no difference. Those facts are in, are bagged, arecaptured; and the good that's in them is gained, be the atoms or be the God their cause. There are accordingly manymaterialists about us to-day who, ignoring altogether the future and practical aspects of the question, seek to eliminatethe odium attaching to the word materialism, and even to eliminate the word itself, by showing that, if matter couldgive birth to all these gains, why then matter, functionally considered, is just as divine an entity as God, in factcoalesces with God, is what you mean by God. Cease, these persons advise us, to use either of these terms, with theiroutgrown opposition. Use a term free of the clerical connotations, on the one hand; of the suggestion of grossness,coarseness, ignobility, on the other. Talk of the primal mystery, of the unknowable energy, of the one and only power,instead of saying either God or matter. This is the course to which Mr. Spencer urges us; and if phi-"},{"pageNumber":566,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP531 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 29]Page 531losophy were purely retrospective, he would thereby proclaim himself an excellent pragmatist.But philosophy is prospective also, and, after finding what the world has been and done and yielded, still asks thefurther question 'what does the world promise?' Give us a matter that promises success, that is bound by its laws tolead our world ever nearer to perfection, and any rational man will worship that matter as readily as Mr. Spencerworships his own so-called unknowable power. It not only has made for righteousness up to date, but it will make forrighteousness forever; and that is all we need. Doing practically all that a God can do, it is equivalent to God, itsfunction is a God's function, and in a world in which a God would be superfluous; from such a world a God couldnever lawfully be missed. 'Cosmic emotion' would here be the right name for religion.But is the matter by which Mr. Spencer's process of cosmic evolution is carried on any such principle of never-endingperfection as this? Indeed it is not, for the future end of every cosmically evolved thing or system of things is foretoldby science to be death and tragedy; and Mr. Spencer, in confining himself to the æsthetic and ignoring the practicalside of the controversy, has really contributed nothing serious to its relief. But apply now our principle of practicalresults, and see what a vital significance the question of materialism or theism immediately acquires.Theism and materialism, so indifferent when taken retrospectively, point, when we take them prospectively, to whollydifferent outlooks of experience. For, according to the theory of mechanical evolution, the laws of redistribution ofmatter and motion, though they are certainly to thank for all the good hours which our organisms have ever yielded usand for all the ideals which our minds now frame, are yet fatally certain to undo their work again, and to redissolveeverything that they have once evolved. You all know the picture of the last state of the universe which evolutionaryscience foresees. I can not state it better than in Mr. Balfour's words: \"The energies of our system will decay, theglory of the sun will be dimmed, and the earth, tideless and inert, will no longer tolerate the race which has for amoment disturbed its solitude."},{"pageNumber":567,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP532 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 30]Page 532Man will go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will perish. The uneasy consciousness which in this obscure cornerhas for a brief space broken the contented silence of the universe, will be at rest. Matter will know itself no longer.'Imperishable monuments' and 'immortal deeds,' death itself, and love stronger than death, will be as if they had notbeen. Nor will anything that is, be better or worse for all that the labor, genius, devotion, and suffering of man havestriven through countless ages to effect.\"1That is the sting of it, that in the vast driftings of the cosmic weather, though many a jewelled shore appears, andmany an enchanted cloud-bank floats away, long lingering ere it be dissolved—even as our world now lingers, for ourjoy—yet when these transient products are gone, nothing, absolutely nothing remains, to represent those particularqualities, those elements of preciousness which they may have enshrined. Dead and gone are they, gone utterly fromthe very sphere and room of being. Without an echo; without a memory; without an influence on aught that may comeafter, to make it care for similar ideals. This utter final wreck and tragedy is of the essence of scientific materialism asat present understood. The lower and not the higher forces are the eternal forces, or the last surviving forces withinthe only cycle of evolution which we can definitely see. Mr. Spencer believes this as much as any one; so why shouldhe argue with us as if we were making silly æsthetic objections to the 'grossness' of 'matter and motion,' the principlesof his philosophy, when what really dismays us is the disconsolateness of its ulterior practical results?No, the true objection to materialism is not positive but negative. It would be farcical at this day to make complaint ofit for what it is, for 'grossness.' Grossness is what grossness does—we now know that. We make complaint of it, onthe contrary, for what it is not—not a permanent warrant for our more ideal interests, not a fulfiller of our remotesthopes.The notion of God, on the other hand, however inferior it may be in clearness to those mathematical notions so currentin mechanical philosophy, has at least this practical superiority1The Foundations of Belief, p. 30."},{"pageNumber":568,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP533 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 46]Page 533over them, that it guarantees an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved. A world with a God in it to say thelast word, may indeed burn up or freeze, but we then think of him as still mindful of the old ideals and sure to bringthem elsewhere to fruition; so that, where he is, tragedy is only provisional and partial, and shipwreck and dissolutionnot the absolutely final things. This need of an eternal moral order is one of the deepest needs of our breast. Andthose poets, like Dante and Wordsworth, who live on the conviction of such an order, owe to that fact theextraordinary tonic and consoling power of their verse. Here then, in these different emotional and practical appeals,in these adjustments of our concrete attitudes of hope and expectation, and all the delicate consequences which theirdifferences entail, lie the real meanings of materialism and spiritualism—not in hair-splitting abstractions aboutmatter's inner essence, or about the metaphysical attributes of God. Materialism means simply the denial that themoral order is eternal, and the cutting off of ultimate hopes; spiritualism means the affirmation of an eternal moralorder and the letting loose of hope. Surely here is an issue genuine enough, for any one who feels it; and, as long asmen are men, it will yield matter for a serious philosophic debate.But possibly some of you may still rally to their defence. Even whilst admitting that spiritualism and materialismmake different prophecies of the world's future, you may yourselves pooh-pooh the difference as something soinfinitely remote as to mean nothing for a sane mind. The essence of a sane mind, you may say, is to take shorterviews, and to feel no concern about such chimæras as the latter end of the world. Well, I can only say that if you saythis, you do injustice to human nature. Religious melancholy is not disposed of by a simple flourish of the wordinsanity. The absolute things, the last things, the overlapping things, are the truly philosophic concerns; all superiorminds feel seriously about them, and the mind with the shortest views is simply the mind of the more shallow man.The issues of fact at stake in the debate are of course vaguely enough conceived by us at present. But spiritualisticfaith in all its forms deals with a world of promise, while"},{"pageNumber":569,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP534 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 48]Page 534materialism's sun sets in a sea of disappointment. Remember what I said of the Absolute: it grants us moral holidays.Any religious view does this. It not only incites our more strenuous moments, but it also takes our joyous, careless,trustful moments, and it justifies them. It paints the grounds of justification vaguely enough, to be sure. The exactfeatures of the saving future facts that our belief in God insures, will have to be ciphered out by the interminablemethods of science: we can study our God only by studying his Creation. But we can enjoy our God, if we have one,in advance of all that labor. I myself believe that the evidence for God lies primarily in inner personal experiences.When they have once given you your God, his name means at least the benefit of the holiday. You remember what Isaid yesterday about the way in which truths clash and try to 'down' each other. The truth of 'God' has to run thegauntlet of all our other truths. It is on trial by them and they on trial by it. Our final opinion about God can be settledonly after all the truths have straightened themselves out together. Let us hope that they shall find a modus vivendi!Let me pass to a very cognate philosophic problem, the question of design in nature. God's existence has from timeimmemorial been held to be proved by certain natural facts. Many facts appear as if expressly designed in view of oneanother. Thus the woodpecker's bill, tongue, feet, tail, etc., fit him wondrously for a world of trees with grubs hid intheir bark to feed upon. The parts of our eye fit the laws of light to perfection, leading its rays to a sharp picture onour retina. Such mutual fitting of things diverse in origin argued design, it was held; and the designer was alwaystreated as a man-loving deity.The first step in these arguments was to prove that the design existed. Nature was ransacked for results obtainedthrough separate things being co-adapted. Our eyes, for instance, originate in intra-uterine darkness, and the lightoriginates in the sun, yet see how they fit each other. They are evidently made for each other. Vision is the enddesigned, light and eyes the separate means devised for its attainment.It is strange, considering how unanimously our ancestors felt the force of this argument, to see how little it counts for"},{"pageNumber":570,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP535 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 49]Page 535since the triumph of the darwinian theory. Darwin opened our minds to the power of chance-happenings to bring forth'fit' results if only they have time to add themselves together. He showed the enormous waste of nature in producingresults that get destroyed because of their unfitness. He also emphasized the number of adaptations which, if designed,would argue an evil rather than a good designer. Here all depends upon the point of view. To the grub under the barkthe exquisite fitness of the woodpecker's organism to extract him would certainly argue a diabolical designer.Theologians have by this time stretched their minds so as to embrace the darwinian facts, and yet to interpret them asstill showing divine purpose. It used to be a question of purpose against mechanism, of one or the other. It was as ifone should say ''My shoes are evidently designed to fit my feet, hence it is impossible that they should have beenproduced by machinery.\" We know that they are both: they are made by a machinery itself designed to fit the feet withshoes. Theology need only stretch similarly the designs of God. As the aim of a football-team is not merely to get theball to a certain goal (if that were so, they would simply get up on some dark night and place it there), but to get itthere by a fixed machinery of conditions—the game's rules and the opposing players; so the aim of God is not merely,let us say, to make men and to save them, but rather to get this done through the sole agency of nature's vastmachinery. Without nature's stupendous laws and counter-forces, man's creation and perfection, we might suppose,would be too insipid achievements for God to have designed them.This saves the form of the design-argument at the expense of its old easy human content. The designer is no longerthe old man-like deity. His designs have grown so vast as to be incomprehensible to us humans. The what of them soover-whelms us that to establish the mere that of a designer for them becomes of very little consequence incomparison. We can with difficulty comprehend the character of a cosmic mind whose purposes are fully revealed bythe strange mixture of goods and evils that we find in this actual world's particulars. Or rather we cannot by anypossibility comprehend it. The mere word 'design' by itself has, we see, no"},{"pageNumber":571,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP536 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 50]Page 536consequences and explains nothing. It is the barrenest of principles. The old question of whether there is design is idle.The real question is what is the world, whether or not it have a designer—and that can be revealed only by the studyof all nature's particulars.Remember that no matter what nature may have produced or may be producing, the means must necessarily have beenadequate, must have been fitted to that production. The argument from fitness to design would consequently alwaysapply, whatever were the product's character. The recent Mont-Pelée eruption, for example, required all previoushistory to produce that exact combination of ruined houses, human and animal corpses, sunken ships, volcanic ashes,etc., in just that one hideous configuration of positions. France had to be a nation and colonize Martinique. Ourcountry had to exist and send our ships there. If God aimed at just that result, the means by which the centuries benttheir influences towards it, showed exquisite intelligence. And so of any state of things whatever, either in nature or inhistory, which we find actually realized. For the parts of things must always make some definite resultant, be itchaotic or harmonious. When we look at what has actually come, the conditions must always appear perfectlydesigned to ensure it. We can always say, therefore, in any conceivable world, of any conceivable character, that thewhole cosmic machinery may have been designed to produce it.Pragmatically, then, the abstract word 'design' is a blank cartridge. It carries no consequences, it does no execution.What sort of design? and what sort of a designer? are the only serious questions, and the study of facts is the onlyway of getting even approximate answers. Meanwhile, pending the slow answer from facts, any one who insists thatthere is a designer and who is sure he is a divine one, gets a certain pragmatic benefit from the term—the same, infact, which we saw that the terms God, Spirit, or the Absolute, yield us. 'Design,' worthless tho it be as a mererationalistic principle set above or behind things for our admiration, becomes, if our faith concretes it into somethingtheistic, a term of promise. Returning with it into experience, we gain a more confiding outlook on the future. If not ablind force but a seeing force"},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP537 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 51]Page 537runs things, we may reasonably expect better issues. This vague confidence in the future is the sole pragmaticmeaning at present discernible in the terms design and designer. But if cosmic confidence is right not wrong, betternot worse, that is a most important meaning. That much at least of possible 'truth' the terms will then have in them.Let me take up another well-worn controversy, the free-will problem. Most persons who believe in what is called theirfree-will do so after the rationalistic fashion. It is a principle, a positive faculty or virtue added to man, by which hisdignity is enigmatically augmented. He ought to believe it for this reason. Determinists, who deny it, who say thatindividual men originate nothing, but merely transmit to the future the whole push of the past cosmos of which theyare so small an expression, diminish man. He is less admirable, stripped of this creative principle. I imagine that morethan half of you share our instinctive belief in free-will, and that admiration of it as a principle of dignity has much todo with your fidelity.But free-will has also been discussed pragmatically, and, strangely enough, the same pragmatic interpretation has beenput upon it by both disputants. You know how large a part questions of accountability have played in ethicalcontroversy. To hear some persons, one would suppose that all that ethics aims at is a code of merits and demerits.Thus does the old legal and theological leaven, the interest in crime and sin and punishment abide with us. 'Who's toblame? whom can we punish? whom will God punish?'—these preoccupations hang like a bad dream over man'sreligious history.So both free-will and determinism have been inveighed against and called absurd, because each, in the eyes of itsenemies, has seemed to prevent the 'imputability' of good or bad deeds to their authors. Queer antinomy this! Free-will means novelty, the grafting on to the past of something not involved therein. If our acts were predetermined, if wemerely transmitted the push of the whole past, the free-willists say, how could we be praised or blamed for anything?We should be 'agents' only, not 'principals,' and where then would be our precious imputability and responsibility?But where would it be if we had free-will? rejoin the deter-"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP538 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 53]Page 538minists. If a 'free' act be a sheer novelty, that comes not from me, the previous me, but ex nihilo, and simply tacksitself on to me, how can I, the previous I, be responsible? How can I have any permanent character that will standstill long enough for praise or blame to be awarded? The chaplet of my days tumbles into a cast of disconnectedbeads as soon as the thread of inner necessity is drawn out by the preposterous indeterminist doctrine. Messrs.Fullerton and McTaggart have recently laid about them doughtily with this argument.It may be good ad hominem, but otherwise it is pitiful. For I ask you, quite apart from other reasons, whether any man,woman or child, with a sense for realities, ought not to be ashamed to plead such principles as either dignity orimputability. Instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment andpraise. If a man does good acts we shall praise him, if he does bad acts we shall punish him,—anyhow, and quite apartfrom theories as to whether the acts result from what was previous in him or are novelties in a strict sense. To makeour human ethics revolve about the question of 'merit' is a piteous unreality—God alone can know our merits, if wehave any. The real ground for supposing free-will is indeed pragmatic, but it has nothing to do with this contemptibleright to punish which has made such a noise in past discussions of the subject.Free-will pragmatically means novelties in the world, the right to expect that in its deepest elements as well as in itssurface phenomena, the future may not identically repeat and imitate the past. That imitation en masse is there, whocan deny? The general 'uniformity of nature' is presupposed by every lesser law. But nature may be onlyapproximately uniform; and persons in whom knowledge of the world's past has bred pessimism (or doubts as to theworld's good character, which become certainties if that character be supposed eternally fixed) may naturally welcomefree-will as a melioristic doctrine. It holds up improvement as at least possible; whereas determinism assures us thatour whole notion of possibility is born of human ignorance, and that necessity and impossibility between them rule thedestinies of the world.Free-will is thus a general cosmological theory of promise,"},{"pageNumber":574,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP539 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 54]Page 539just like the Absolute, God, Spirit or Design. Taken abstractly, no one of these terms has any inner content, none ofthem gives us any picture, and no one of them would retain the least pragmatic value in a world whose character wasobviously perfect from the start. Elation at mere existence, pure cosmic emotion and delight, would, it seems to me,quench all interest in those speculations, if the world were nothing but a lubberland of happiness already. Our interestin religious metaphysics arises in the fact that our empirical future feels to us unsafe, and needs some higherguarantee. If the past and present were purely good, who could wish that the future might possibly not resemble them?Who could desire free-will? Who would not say, with Huxley, 'let me be wound up every day like a watch, to go rightfatally, and I ask no better freedom.' 'Freedom' in a world already perfect could only mean freedom to be worse, andwho could be so insane as to wish that? To be necessarily what it is, to be impossibly aught else, would put the lasttouch of perfection upon optimism's universe. Surely the only possibility that one can rationally claim is the possibilitythat things may be better. That possibility, I need hardly say, is one that, as the actual world goes, we have amplegrounds for desiderating.Free-will thus has no meaning unless it be a doctrine of relief. As such, it takes its place with other religious doctrines.Between them, they build up the old wastes and repair the former desolations. Our spirit, shut within this courtyard ofsense-experience, is always saying to the intellect upon the tower: 'Watchman, tell us of the night, if it aught ofpromise bear,' and the intellect gives it then these terms of promise.Other than this practical significance, the words God, free-will, design, etc., have none. Yet dark tho they be inthemselves, or intellectualistically taken, when we bear them into life's thicket with us the darkness there grows lightabout us. If you stop, in dealing with such words, with their definition, thinking that to be an intellectual finality,where are you? Stupidly staring at a pretentious sham! \"Deus est Ens, a se, extra et supra omne genus, necessarium,unum, infinite perfectum, simplex, immutabile, immensum, aeternum, intelligens,\" etc.,—wherein is such a definitionreally instructive? It means less than nothing, in its pompous robe of adjectives. Prag-"},{"pageNumber":575,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP540 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 55]Page 540matism alone can read a positive meaning into it, and for that she turns her back upon the intellectualist point of viewaltogether. 'God's in his heaven; all's right with the world!'—That's the real heart of your theology, and for that youneed no rationalist definitions.Why should n't we all of us, rationalists as well as pragmatists, confess this? Pragmatism, so far from keeping hereyes bent on the immediate practical foreground, as she is accused of doing, dwells just as much upon the world'sremotest perspectives.See then how all these ultimate questions turn, as it were, upon their hinges; and from looking backwards uponprinciples, upon an erkenntnisstheoretische Ich, a God, a Kausalitätsprinzip, a Design, a Free-will, taken inthemselves, as something august and exalted above facts,—see, I say, how pragmatism shifts the emphasis and looksforward into facts themselves. The really vital question for us all is, What is this world going to be? What is lifeeventually to make of itself? The centre of gravity of philosophy must therefore alter its place. The earth of things,long thrown into shadow by the glories of the upper ether, must resume its rights. To shift the emphasis in this waymeans that philosophic questions will fall to be treated by minds of a less abstractionist type than heretofore, mindsmore scientific and individualistic in their tone yet not irreligious either. It will be an alteration in 'the seat ofauthority' that reminds one almost of the protestant reformation. And as, to papal minds, protestantism has oftenseemed a mere mess of anarchy and confusion, such, no doubt, will pragmatism often seem to ultra-rationalist mindsin philosophy. It will seem so much sheer trash, philosophically. But life wags on, all the same, and compasses itsends, in protestant countries. I venture to think that philosophic protestantism will compass a not dissimilar prosperity."},{"pageNumber":576,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP541 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 57]Page 541Lecture IVThe One and the ManyWe saw in the last lecture that the pragmatic method, in its dealings with certain concepts, instead of ending withadmiring contemplation, plunges forward into the river of experience with them and prolongs the perspective by theirmeans. Design, free-will, the absolute mind, spirit instead of matter, have for their sole meaning a better promise as tothis world's outcome. Be they false or be they true, the meaning of them is this meliorism. I have sometimes thoughtof the phenomenon called 'total reflexion' in optics as a good symbol of the relation between abstract ideas andconcrete realities, as pragmatism conceives it. Hold a tumbler of water a little above your eyes and look up throughthe water at its surface—or better still look similarly through the flat wall of an aquarium. You will then see anextraordinarily brilliant reflected image say of a candle-flame, or any other clear object, situated on the opposite sideof the vessel. No candle-ray, under these circumstances gets beyond the water's surface: every ray is totally reflectedback into the depths again. Now let the water represent the world of sensible facts, and let the air above it representthe world of abstract ideas. Both worlds are real, of course, and interact; but they interact only at their boundary, andthe locus of everything that lives, and happens to us, so far as full experience goes, is the water. We are like fishesswimming in the sea of sense, bounded above by the superior element, but unable to breathe it pure or penetrate it.We get our oxygen from it, however, we touch it incessantly, now in this part, now in that, and every time we touchit, we are reflected back into the water with our course re-determined and re-energized. The abstract ideas of whichthe air consists are indispensable for life, but irrespirable by themselves, as it were, and only active in their re-directing function. All similes are halting, but this one rather takes my fancy. It shows how something, not sufficientfor life in itself, may nevertheless be an effective determinant of life elsewhere."},{"pageNumber":577,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP542 hl[01 03 2011 01 37 58]Page 542In this present hour I wish to illustrate the pragmatic method by one more application. I wish to turn its light upon theancient problem of 'the one and the many.' I suspect that in but few of you has this problem occasioned sleeplessnights, and I should not be astonished if some of you told me it had never vexed you. I myself have come, by longbrooding over it, to consider it the most central of all philosophic problems, central because so pregnant. I mean bythis that if you know whether a man is a decided monist or a decided pluralist, you perhaps know more about the restof his opinions than if you give him any other name ending in ist. To believe in the one or in the many, that is theclassification with the maximum number of consequences. So bear with me for an hour while I try to inspire you withmy own interest in this problem.Philosophy has often been defined as the quest or the vision of the world's unity. We never hear this definitionchallenged, and it is true as far as it goes, for philosophy has indeed manifested above all things its interest in unity.But how about the variety in things? Is that such an irrelevant matter? If instead of using the term philosophy, we talkin general of our intellect and its needs, we quickly see that unity is only one of these. Acquaintance with the detailsof fact is always reckoned, along with their reduction to system, as an indispensable mark of mental greatness. Your'scholarly' mind, of encyclopedic, philological type, your man essentially of learning, has never lacked for praise alongwith your philosopher. What our intellect really aims at is neither variety nor unity taken singly, but totality.1 In this,acquaintance with reality's diversities is as important as understanding their connexion. The human passion ofcuriosity runs on all fours with the systematizing passion.In spite of this obvious fact the unity of things has always been considered more illustrious, as it were, than theirvariety. When a young man first conceives the notion that the whole world forms one great fact, with all its partsmoving abreast, as it were, and interlocked, he feels as if he were enjoying a great insight, and looks superciliously onall who still1Compare A. Bellanger: Les concepts de Cause, et Pactivité intentionelle de l'Esprit.

Taken thus abstractly as it first comes to one, the monistic insight is so vague ashardly to seem worth defending intellectually. Yet probably every one in this audience in some way cherishes it. Acertain abstract monism, a certain emotional response to the character of oneness, as if it were a feature of the worldnot co-ordinate with its manyness, but vastly more excellent and eminent, is so prevalent in educated circles that wemight almost call it a part of philosophic common sense. Of course the world is one, we say. How else could it be aworld at all? Empiricists as a rule, are as stout monists of this abstract kind as rationalists are.The difference is that the empiricists are less dazzled. Unity doesn't blind them to everything else, doesn't quench theircuriosity for special facts, whereas there is a kind of rationalist who is sure to interpret abstract unity mystically and toforget everything else, to treat it as a principle; to admire and worship it; and thereupon to come to a full stopintellectually.'The world is One!'—the formula may become a sort of number-worship. 'Three' and 'seven' have, it is true, beenreckoned sacred numbers; but, abstractly taken, why is 'one' more excellent than 'forty-three,' or than 'two million andten'? In this first vague conviction of the world's unity, there is so little to take hold of that we hardly know what wemean by it.The only way to get forward with our notion is to treat it pragmatically. Granting the oneness to exist, what facts willbe different in consequence? What will the unity be known as? The world is one—yes, but how one? What is thepractical value of the oneness for us?Asking such questions, we pass from the vague to the definite, from the abstract to the concrete. Many distinct waysin which a oneness predicated of the universe might make a difference, come to view. I will note successively themore obvious of these ways.1. First, the world is at least one subject of discourse. If its manyness were so irremediable as to permit no unionwhatever of its parts, not even our minds could 'mean' the whole of it at once: they would be like eyes trying to lookin oppo-"},{"pageNumber":579,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP544 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 00]Page 544site directions. But in point of fact we mean to cover the whole of it by our abstract term 'world' or 'universe,' whichexpressly intends that no part shall be left out. Such unity of discourse carries obviously no farther monisticspecifications. A 'chaos,' once so named, has as much unity of discourse as a cosmos. It is an odd fact that manymonists consider a great victory scored for their side when pluralists say 'the universe is many.' \"'The universe'!\" theychuckle—\"his speech bewrayeth him. He stands confessed of monism out of his own mouth.\" Well, let things be onein that sense! You can then fling such a word as universe at the whole collection of them, but what matters it? It stillremains to be ascertained whether they are one in any other sense that is more valuable.2. Are they, for example, continuous? Can you pass from one to another, keeping always in your one universe withoutany danger of falling out? In other words, do the parts of our universe hang together, instead of being like detachedgrains of sand?Even grains of sand hang together through the space in which they are embedded, and if you can in any way movethrough such space, you can pass continuously from number one of them to number two. Space and time are thusvehicles of continuity by which the world's parts hang together. The practical difference to us, resultant from theseforms of union, is immense. Our whole motor life is based upon them.3. There are innumerable other paths of practical continuity among things. Lines of influence can be traced by whichthey hang together. Following any such line you pass from one thing to another till you may have covered a good partof the universe's extent. Gravity and heat-conduction are such all-uniting influences, so far as the physical world goes.Electric, luminous and chemical influences follow similar lines of influence. But opaque and inert bodies interrupt thecontinuity here, so that you have to step round them, or change your mode of progress if you wish to get farther onthat day. Practically, you have then lost your universe's unity, so far as it was constituted by those first lines ofinfluence.There are innumerable kinds of connexion that special things have with other special things; and the ensemble of anyone of these connexions forms one sort of system by which"},{"pageNumber":580,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP545 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 02]Page 545things are conjoined. Thus men are conjoined in a vast network of acquaintanceship. Brown knows Jones, Jonesknows Robinson, etc.; and by choosing your farther intermediaries rightly you may carry a message from Jones to theEmpress of China, or the Chief of the African Pigmies, or to any one else in the inhabited world. But you are stoppedshort, as by a non-conductor, when you choose one man wrong in this experiment. What may be called love-systemsare grafted on the acquaintance-system. A loves (or hates) B; B loves (or hates) C, etc. But these systems are smallerthan the great acquaintance-system that they presuppose.Human efforts are daily unifying the world more and more in definite systematic ways. We found colonial, postal,consular, commercial systems, all the parts of which obey definite influences that propagate themselves within thesystem but not to facts outside of it. The result is innumerable little hangings-together of the world's parts within thelarger hangings-together, little worlds, not only of discourse but of operation, within the wider universe. Each systemexemplifies one type or grade of union, its parts being strung on that peculiar kind of relation, and the same part mayfigure in many different systems, as a man may hold several offices and belong to various clubs. From this'systematic' point of view, therefore, the pragmatic value of the world's unity is that all these definite networks actuallyand practically exist. Some are more enveloping and extensive, some less so; they are superposed upon each other;and between them all they let no individual elementary part of the universe escape. Enormous as is the amount ofdisconnexion among things (for these systematic influences and conjunctions follow rigidly exclusive paths),everything that exists is influenced in some way by something else, if you can only pick the way out rightly. Looselyspeaking, and in general, it may be said that all things cohere and adhere to each other somehow, and that the universeexists practically in reticulated or concatenated forms which make of it a continuous or 'integrated' affair. Any kind ofinfluence whatever helps to make the world one, so far as you can follow it from next to next. You may then say that'the world is One,'—meaning in these respects, namely, and just so far as they obtain. But just as definitely is it notOne,"},{"pageNumber":581,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP546 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 03]Page 546so far as they do not obtain; and there is no species of connexion which will not fail, if, instead of choosingconductors for it you choose non-conductors. You are then arrested at your very first step and have to write the worlddown as a pure many from that particular point of view. If our intellect had been as much interested in disjunctive asit is in conjunctive relations, philosophy would have equally successfully celebrated the world's disunion.The great point is to notice that the oneness and the manyness are absolutely co-ordinate here. Neither is primordial ormore essential or excellent than the other. Just as with space, whose separating of things seems exactly on a par withits uniting of them, but sometimes one function and sometimes the other is what comes home to us most, so, in ourgeneral dealings with the world of influences, we now need conductors and now need non-conductors, and wisdomlies in knowing which is which at the appropriate moment.4. All these systems of influence or non-influence may be listed under the general problem of the world's causal unity.If the minor causal influences among things should converge towards one common causal origin of them in the past,one great first cause for all that is, one might then speak of the absolute causal unity of the world. God's fiat oncreation's day has figured in traditional philosophy as such an absolute cause and origin. Transcendental Idealism,translating 'creation' into 'thinking' (or 'willing to think') calls the divine act 'eternal' rather than 'first'; but the union ofthe many here is absolute, just the same—the many would not be, save for the One. Against this notion of the unity oforigin of all things there has always stood the pluralistic notion of an eternal self-existing many in the shape of atomsor even of spiritual units of some sort. The alternative has doubtless a pragmatic meaning, but perhaps, as far as theselectures go, we had better leave the question of unity of origin unsettled.5. The most important sort of union that obtains among things, pragmatically speaking, is their generic unity. Thingsexist in kinds, there are many specimens in each kind, and what the 'kind' implies for one specimen, it implies also forevery other specimen of that kind. We can easily conceive that every fact in the world might be singular, that is,unlike any"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP547 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 05]Page 547other fact and sole of its kind. In such a world of singulars our logic would be useless, for logic works by predicatingof the single instance what is true of all its kind. With no two things alike in the world, we should be unable to reasonfrom our past experiences to our future ones. The existence of so much generic unity in things is thus perhaps themost momentous pragmatic specification of what it may mean to say 'the world is One.' Absolute generic unity wouldobtain if there were one summum genus under which all things without exception could be eventually subsumed.'Beings,' 'thinkables,' 'experiences,' would be candidates for this position. Whether the alternatives expressed by suchwords have any pragmatic significance or not, is another question which I prefer to leave unsettled just now.6. Another specification of what the phrase 'the world is one' may mean is unity of purpose. An enormous number ofthings in the world subserve a common purpose. All the manmade systems, administrative, industrial, military, orwhat not, exist each for its controlling purpose. Every living being pursues its own peculiar purposes. They co-operate, according to the degree of their development, in collective or tribal purposes, larger ends thus envelopinglesser ones, until an absolutely single, final and climacteric purpose subserved by all things without exception mightconceivably be reached. It is needless to say that the appearances conflict with such a view. Any resultant, as I said inmy third lecture, may have been purposed in advance, but none of the results we actually know in this world have inpoint of fact been purposed in advance in all their details. Men and nations start with a vague notion of being rich, orgreat, or good. Each step they make brings unforeseen chances into sight, and shuts out older vistas, and thespecifications of the general purpose have to be daily changed. What is reached in the end may be better or worsethan what was proposed, but it is always more complex and different.Our different purposes also are at war with each other.

Theologians who dogmatize thus find it more and more impossible, as ouracquaintance with the warring interests of the world's parts grows more concrete, to imagine what the one climactericpurpose may possibly be like. We see indeed that certain evils minister to ulterior goods, that the bitter makes thecocktail better, and that a bit of danger or hardship puts us agreeably to our trumps. We can vaguely generalize thisinto the doctrine that all the evil in the universe is but instrumental to its greater perfection. But the scale of the evilactually in sight defies all human tolerance; and transcendental idealism, in the pages of a Bradley or a Royce, bringsus no farther than the book of Job did—God's ways are not our ways, so let us put our hands upon our mouth. A Godwho can relish such superfluities of horror is no God for human beings to appeal to. His animal spirits are too high,his practical jokes too monstrous. In other words the 'Absolute' with his one purpose, is not the man-like God ofcommon people.7. Æsthetic union among things also obtains, and is very analogous to teleological union. Things tell a story. Theirparts hang together so as to work out a climax. They play into each other's hands expressively. Retrospectively, wecan see that altho no definite purpose presided over a chain of events, yet the events fell into a dramatic form, with astart, a middle, and a finish. In point of fact all stories end; and here again the point of view of a many is the morenatural one to take. The world is full of partial stories that run parallel to one another, beginning and ending at oddtimes. They mutually interlace and interfere at points, but we can not unify them completely in our minds. Infollowing your life-history, I must temporarily turn my attention from my own. Even a biographer of twins wouldhave to press them alternately upon his reader's attention.It follows that whoever says that the whole world tells one story utters another of those monistic dogmas that a manbelieves at his risk.

The microscopist makes a hundred flat cross-sections of agiven embryo, and mentally unites them into one solid whole. But the great world's ingredients, so far as they arebeings, seem, like the rope's fibres, to be discontinuous cross-wise, and to cohere only in the longitudinal direction.Followed in that direction they are many. Even the embryologist, when he follows the development of his object, hasto treat the history of each single organ in turn. Absolute æsthetic union is thus another barely abstract ideal. Theworld appears as something more epic than dramatic.So far, then, we see how the world is unified by its many systems, kinds, purposes, and dramas. That there is moreunion in all these ways than openly appears is certainly true. That there may be one sovereign purpose, system, kind,and story, is a legitimate hypothesis. All I say here is that it is rash to affirm this dogmatically without better evidencethan we possess at present.8. The great monistic denkmittel for a hundred years past has been the notion of the one Knower. The many exist onlyas objects for his thought—exist in his dream, as it were; and as he knows them, they have one purpose, form onesystem, tell one tale for him. This notion of an all-enveloping noetic unity in things is the sublimest achievement ofintellectualist philosophy. Those who believe in the Absolute, as the allknower is termed, usually say that they do sofor coercive reasons, which clear thinkers can not evade. The Absolute has far-reaching practical consequences, tosome of which I drew attention in my second lecture. Many kinds of difference important to us would surely followfrom its being true. I can not here enter into all the logical proofs of such a Being's existence, farther than to say thatnone of them seem to me sound. I must therefore treat the notion of an All-Knower simply as an hypothesis, exactlyon a par logically with the pluralist notion that there is no point of view, no focus of information extant, from whichthe entire content of the uni-"},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP550 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 25]Page 550verse is visible at once. ''God's conscience,\" says Professor Royce,1 \"forms in its wholeness one luminouslytransparent conscious moment\"—this is the type of noetic unity on which rationalism insists. Empiricism on the otherhand is satisfied with the type of noetic unity that is humanly familiar. Everything gets known by some knower alongwith something else; but the knowers may in the end be irreducibly many, and the greatest knower of them all mayyet not know the whole of everything, or even know what he does know at one single stroke:—he may be liable toforget. Whichever type obtained, the world would still be a universe noetically. Its parts would be conjoined byknowledge, but in the one case the knowledge would be absolutely unified, in the other it would be strung along andoverlapped.The notion of one instantaneous or eternal Knower—either adjective here means the same thing—is, as I said, thegreat intellectualist achievement of our time. It has practically driven out that conception of 'Substance' which earlierphilosophers set such store by, and by which so much unifying work used to be done—universal substance whichalone has being in and from itself, and of which all the particulars of experience are but forms to which it givessupport. Substance has succumbed to the pragmatic criticisms of the English school. It appears now only as anothername for the fact that phenomena as they come are actually grouped and given in coherent forms, the very forms inwhich we finite knowers experience or think them together. These forms of conjunction are as much parts of thetissue of experience as are the terms which they connect; and it is a great pragmatic achievement for recent idealismto have made the world hang together in these directly representable ways instead of drawing its unity from the'inherence' of its parts—whatever that may mean—in an unimaginable principle behind the scenes.'The world is one,' therefore, just so far as we experience it to be concatenated, one by as many definite conjunctionsas appear. But then also not one by just as many definite disjunctions as we find. The oneness and the manyness of itthus obtain in respects which can be separately named. It is neither1The Conception of God, New York, 1897, p. 292."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP551 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 26]Page 551a universe pure and simple nor a multiverse pure and simple. And its various manners of being one suggest, for theiraccurate ascertainment, so many distinct programs of scientific work. Thus the pragmatic question 'What is theoneness known as? What practical difference will it make?' saves us from all feverish excitement over it as a principleof sublimity and carries us forward into the stream of experience with a cool head. The stream may indeed reveal farmore connection and union than we now suspect, but we are not entitled on pragmatic principles to claim absoluteoneness in any respect in advance.It is so difficult to see definitely what absolute oneness can mean, that probably the majority of you are satisfied withthe sober attitude which we have reached. Nevertheless there are possibly some radically monistic souls among youwho are not content to leave the one and the many on a par. Union of various grades, union of diverse types, unionthat stops at non-conductors, union that merely goes from next to next, and means in many cases outer nextness only,and not a more internal bond, union of concatenation, in short; all that sort of thing seems to you a halfway stage ofthought. The oneness of things, superior to their manyness, you think must also be more deeply true, must be the morereal aspect of the world. The pragmatic view, you are sure, gives us a universe imperfectly rational. The real universemust form an unconditional unit of being, something consolidated, with its parts co-implicated through and through.Only then could we consider our estate completely rational.There is no doubt whatever that this ultra-monistic way of thinking means a great deal to many minds. \"One Life, OneTruth, one Love, one Principle, One Good, One God\"—I quote from a Christian Science leaflet which the day's mailbrings into my hands—beyond doubt such a confession of faith has pragmatically an emotional value, and beyonddoubt the word 'one' contributes to the value quite as much as the other words. But if we try to realize intellectuallywhat we can possibly mean by such a glut of oneness we are thrown right back upon our pragmatistic determinationsagain. It means either the mere name One, the universe of discourse; or it means the sum total of all the ascertainableparticular con-"},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP552 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 28]Page 552junctions and concatenations; or, finally, it means some one vehicle of conjunction treated as all-inclusive, like oneorigin, one purpose, or one knower. In point of fact it always means one knower to those who take it intellectually to-day. The one knower involves, they think, the other forms of conjunction. His world must have all its parts co-implicated in the one logical-æsthetical-teleological unit-picture which is his eternal dream.The character of the absolute knower's picture is however so impossible for us to represent clearly, that we may fairlysuppose that the authority which absolute monism undoubtedly possesses, and probably always will possess over somepersons, draws its strength far less from intellectual than from mystical grounds. To interpret absolute monismworthily, be a mystic. Mystical states of mind in every degree are shown by history, usually tho not always, to makefor the monistic view. This is no proper occasion to enter upon the general subject of mysticism, but I will quote onemystical pronouncement to show just what I mean. The paragon of all monistic systems is the Vedânta philosophy ofHindostan, and the paragon of Vedântist missionaries was the late Swami Vivekananda who visited our shores someyears ago. The method of Vedântism is the mystical method. You do not reason, but after going through a certaindiscipline you see, and having seen, you can report the truth. Vivekananda thus reports the truth in one of his lectureshere:\"Where is there any more misery for him who sees this Oneness in the universe, this Oneness of life, Oneness ofeverything? This separation between man and man, man and woman, man and child, nation from nation, earth frommoon, moon from sun, this separation between atom and atom is the cause really of all the misery, and the Vedântasays this separation does not exist, it is not real. It is merely apparent, on the surface. In the heart of things there isunity still. If you go inside you find that unity between man and man, women and children, races and races, high andlow, rich and poor, the gods and men: all are One, and animals too, if you go deep enough, and he who has attained tothat has no more delusion . Where is there any more delusion for him? What can delude him? He knows the reality ofevery-"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP553 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 29]Page 553thing, the secret of everything. Where is there any more misery for him? What does he desire? He has traced thereality of everything unto the Lord, that centre, that Unity of everything, and that is Eternal Bliss, Eternal Knowledge,Eternal Existence. Neither death nor disease nor sorrow nor misery nor discontent is There . In the Centre, the reality,there is no one to be mourned for, no one to be sorry for. He has penetrated everything, the Pure One, the Formless,the Bodiless, the Stainless, He the Knower, He the great Poet, the Self-Existent, He who is giving to every one whathe deserves.\"Observe how radical the character of the monism here is. Separation is not simply overcome by the One, it is deniedto exist. There is no many. We are not parts of the One; It has no parts; and since in a sense we undeniably are, itmust be that each of us is the One, indivisibly and totally. An Absolute One, and I that One,—surely we have here areligion which, emotionally considered, has a high pragmatic value; it imparts a perfect sumptuousity of security. Asour Swami says in another place:\"When man has seen himself as One with the infinite Being of the universe, when all separateness has ceased, whenall men, all women, all angels, all gods, all animals, all plants, the whole universe has been melted into that oneness,then all fear disappears. Whom to fear? Can I hurt myself? Can I kill myself? Can I injure myself? Do you fearyourself? Then will all sorrow disappear. What can cause me sorrow? I am the One Existence of the universe. Thenall jealousies will disappear; of whom to be jealous? Of myself? Then all bad feelings disappear. Against whom shallI have this bad feeling? Against myself? There is none in the universe but me kill out this differentiation, kill outthis superstition that there are many. 'He who, in this world of many, sees that One; he who, in this mass ofinsentiency, sees that One Sentient Being; he who in this world of shadow, catches that Reality, unto him belongseternal peace, unto none else, unto none else.'\"We all have some ear for this monistic music: it elevates and reassures. We all have at least the germ of mysticism inus. And when our idealists recite their arguments for the Absolute, saying that the slightest union admitted anywherecarries"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP554 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 31]Page 554logically absolute Oneness with it, and that the slightest separation admitted anywhere logically carries disunionremediless and complete, I cannot help suspecting that the palpable weak places in the intellectual reasonings they useare protected from their own criticism by a mystical feeling that, logic or no logic, absolute Oneness must somehow atany cost be true. Oneness overcomes moral separateness at any rate. In the passion of love we have the mystic germof what might mean a total union of all sentient life. This mystical germ wakes up in us on hearing the monisticutterances, acknowledges their authority, and assigns to intellectual considerations a secondary place.I will dwell no longer on these religious and moral aspects of the question in this lecture. When I come to my finallecture there will be something more to say.Leave then out of consideration for the moment the authority which mystical insights may be conjectured eventuallyto possess; treat the problem of the One and the Many in a purely intellectual way; and we see clearly enough wherepragmatism stands. With her criterion of the practical differences that theories make, we see that she must equallyabjure absolute monism and absolute pluralism. The world is One just so far as its parts hang together by any definiteconnection. It is many just so far as any definite connexion fails to obtain. And finally it is growing more and moreunified by those systems of connexion at least which human energy keeps framing as time goes on.It is possible to imagine alternative universes to the one we know, in which the most various grades and types ofunion should be embodied. Thus the lowest grade of universe would be a world of mere withness, of which the partswere only strung together by the conjunction 'and.' Such a universe is even now the collection of our several innerlives. The spaces and times of your imagination, the objects and events of your day-dreams are not only more or lessincoherent inter se, but are wholly out of definite relation with the similar contents of any one else's mind. Ourvarious reveries now as we sit here compenetrate each other idly without influencing or interfering. They coexist, butin no order and in no receptacle, being the nearest approach to an absolute 'many' that we"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP555 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 32]Page 555can conceive. We can not even imagine any reason why they should be known all together, and we can imagine evenless, if they were known together, how they could be known as one systematic whole.But add our sensations and bodily actions, and the union mounts to a much higher grade. Our audita et visa and ouracts fall into those receptacles of time and space in which each event finds its date and place. They form 'things' andare of 'kinds' too, and can be classed. Yet we can imagine a world of things and of kinds in which the casualinteractions with which we are so familiar should not exist. Everything there might be inert towards everything else,and refuse to propagate its influence. Or gross mechanical influences might pass, but no chemical action. Such worldswould be far less unified than ours. Again there might be complete physico-chemical interaction, but no minds; orminds, but altogether private ones, with no social life; or social life limited to acquaintance, but no love; or love, butno customs or institutions that should systematize it. No one of these grades of universe would be absolutely irrationalor disintegrated, inferior tho it might appear when looked at from the higher grades. For instance, if our minds shouldever become 'telepathically' connected, so that we knew immediately, or could under certain conditions knowimmediately, each what the other was thinking, the world we now live in would appear to the thinkers in that world tohave been of an inferior grade.With the whole of past eternity open for our conjectures to range in, it may be lawful to wonder whether the variouskinds of union now realized in the universe that we inhabit may not possibly have been successively evolved after thefashion in which we now see human systems evolving in consequence of human needs. If such an hypothesis werelegitimate, total oneness would appear at the end of things rather than at their origin. In other words the notion of the'Absolute' would have to be replaced by that of the 'Ultimate.' The two notions would have the same content—themaximally unified content of fact, namely—but their time-relations would be positively reversed.11Compare on the Ultimate, Mr. Schiller's essay \"Activity and Substance,\" in his book entitled Humanism, p. 204."},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP556 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 33]Page 556After discussing the unity of the universe in this pragmatic way, you ought to see why I said in my second lecture,borrowing the word from my friend G. Papini, that pragmatism tends to unstiffen all our theories. The world's onenesshas generally been affirmed abstractly only, and as if any one who questioned it must be an idiot. The temper ofmonists has been so vehement, as almost at times to be convulsive; and this way of holding a doctrine does not easilygo with reasonable discussion and the drawing of distinctions. The theory of the Absolute, in particular, has had to bean article of faith, affirmed dogmatically and exclusively. The One and All, first in the order of being and of knowing,logically necessary itself, and uniting all lesser things in the bonds of mutual necessity, how could it allow of anymitigation of its inner rigidity? The slightest suspicion of pluralism, the minutest wiggle of independence of any oneof its parts from the control of the totality would ruin it. Absolute unity brooks no degrees,—as well might you claimabsolute purity for a glass of water because it contains but a single little cholera-germ. The independence, howeverinfinitesimal, of a part, however small, would be to the Absolute as fatal as a cholera-germ.Pluralism on the other hand has no need of this dogmatic rigoristic temper. Provided you grant some separation amongthings, some tremor of independence, some free play of parts on one another, some real novelty or chance, howeverminute, she is amply satisfied, and will allow you any amount, however great, of real union. How much of union theremay be is a question that she thinks can only be decided empirically. The amount may be enormous, colossal; butabsolute monism is shattered if, along with all the union, there has to be granted the slightest modicum, the mostincipient nascency, or the most residual trace, of a separation that is not 'overcome.'Pragmatism, pending the final empirical ascertainment of just what the balance of union and disunion among thingsmay be, must obviously range herself upon the pluralistic side. Some day, she admits, even total union, with oneknower, one origin, and a universe consolidated in every conceivable way, may turn out to be the most acceptable ofall hypotheses. Meanwhile the opposite hypothesis, of a world"},{"pageNumber":592,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP557 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 35]Page 557imperfectly unified still, and perhaps always to remain so, must be sincerely entertained. This latter hypothesis ispluralism's doctrine. Since absolute monism forbids its being even considered seriously, branding it as irrational fromthe start, it is clear that pragmatism must turn its back on absolute monism, and follow pluralism's more empiricalpath.This leaves us with the common-sense world, in which we find things partly joined and partly disjoined. 'Things,'then, and their 'conjunctions'—what do such words mean, pragmatically handled? In my next lecture, I will apply thepragmatic method to the stage of philosophizing known as Common Sense."},{"pageNumber":593,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP558 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 36]Page 558Lecture VPragmatism and Common SenseIn the last lecture we turned ourselves from the usual way of talking of the universe's oneness as a principle, sublimein all its blankness, towards a study of the special kinds of union which the universe enfolds. We found many of theseto coexist with kinds of separation equally real. 'How far am I verified?' is the question which each kind of union andeach kind of separation asks us here, so as good pragmatists we have to turn our face towards experience, towards'facts.'Absolute oneness remains, but only as an hypothesis, and that hypothesis is reduced nowadays to that of anomniscient knower who sees all things without exception as forming one single systematic fact. But the knower inquestion may still be conceived either as an Absolute or as an Ultimate; and over against the hypothesis of him ineither form the counter-hypothesis that the widest field of knowledge that ever was or will be still contains someignorance, may be legitimately held. Some bits of information always may escape.This is the hypothesis of noetic pluralism, which monists consider so absurd. Since we are bound to treat it asrespectfully as noetic monism, until the facts shall have tipped the beam, we find that our pragmatism, tho originallynothing but a method, has forced us to be friendly to the pluralistic view. It may be that some parts of the world areconnected so loosely with some other parts as to be strung along by nothing but the copula and. They might evencome and go without those other parts suffering any internal change. This pluralistic view, of a world of additiveconstitution, is one that pragmatism is unable to rule out from serious consideration. But this view leads one to thefarther hypothesis that the actual world, instead of being complete 'eternally,' as the monists assure us, may beeternally incomplete, and at all times subject to addition or liable to loss.It is at any rate incomplete in one respect, and flagrantly so. The very fact that we debate this question shows that our"},{"pageNumber":594,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP559 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 37]Page 559knowledge is incomplete at present and subject to addition. In respect of the knowledge it contains the world doesgenuinely change and grow. Some general remarks on the way in which our knowledge completes itself—when itdoes complete itself—will lead us very conveniently into our subject for this lecture, which is 'Common Sense.'To begin with, our knowledge grows in spots. The spots may be large or small, but the knowledge never grows allover: some old knowledge always remains what it was. Your knowledge of pragmatism, let us suppose, is growingnow. Later, its growth may involve considerable modification of opinions which you previously held to be true. Butsuch modifications are apt to be gradual. To take the nearest possible example, consider these lectures of mine. Whatyou first gain from them is probably a small amount of new information, a few new definitions, or distinctions, orpoints of view. But while these special ideas are being added, the rest of your knowledge stands still, and onlygradually will you 'line up' your previous opinions with the novelties I am trying to instil, and modify to some slightdegree their mass.You listen to me now, I suppose, with certain prepossessions as to my competency, and these affect your reception ofwhat I say, but were I suddenly to break off lecturing, and to begin to sing 'We won't go home till morning' in a richbaritone voice, not only would that new fact be added to your stock, but it would oblige you to define me differently,and that might alter your opinion of the pragmatic philosophy, and in general bring about a rearrangement of anumber of your ideas. Your mind in such processes is strained, and sometimes painfully so, between its older beliefsand the novelties which experience brings along.Our minds thus grow in spots; and like grease-spots, the spots spread. But we let them spread as little as possible: wekeep unaltered as much of our old knowledge, as many of our old prejudices and beliefs, as we can. We patch andtinker more than we renew. The novelty soaks in; it stains the ancient mass; but it is also tinged by what absorbs it.Our past apperceives and co-operates; and in the new equilibrium in which each step forward in the process oflearning terminates, it happens relatively seldom that the new fact is added raw."},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP560 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 38]Page 560More usually it is embedded cooked, as one might say, or stewed down in the sauce of the old.New truths thus are resultants of new experiences and of old truths combined and mutually modifying one another.And since this is the case in the changes of opinion of to-day, there is no reason to assume that it has not been so at alltimes. It follows that very ancient modes of thought may have survived through all the later changes in men'sopinions. The most primitive ways of thinking may not yet be wholly expunged. Like our five fingers, our ear-bones,our rudimentary caudal appendage, or our other 'vestigial' peculiarities, they may remain as indelible tokens of eventsin our race-history. Our ancestors may at certain moments have struck into ways of thinking which they mightconceivably not have found. But once they did so, and after the fact, the inheritance continues. When you begin apiece of music in a certain key, you must keep the key to the end. You may alter your house ad libitum, but theground-plan of the first architect persists—you can make great changes, but you can not change a Gothic church intoa Doric temple. You may rinse and rinse the bottle, but you can't get the taste of the medicine or whiskey that firstfilled it wholly out.My thesis now is this, that our fundamental ways of thinking about things are discoveries of exceedingly remoteancestors, which have been able to preserve themselves throughout the experience of all subsequent time. They formone great stage of equilibrium in the human mind's development, the stage of common sense. Other stages havegrafted themselves upon this stage, but have never succeeded in displacing it. Let us consider this common-sensestage first, as if it might be final.In practical talk, a man's common sense means his good judgment, his freedom from excentricity, his gumption, to usethe vernacular word. In philosophy it means something entirely different, it means his use of certain intellectual formsor categories of thought. Were we lobsters, or bees, it might be that our organization would have led to our using quitedifferent modes from these of apprehending our experiences. It might be too (we can not dogmatically deny this) thatsuch categories, unimaginable by us to-day, would have proved on"},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP561 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 40]Page 561the whole as serviceable for handling our experiences mentally as those which we actually use.If this sounds paradoxical to any one, let him think of analytical geometry. The identical figures which Euclid definedby intrinsic relations were defined by Descartes by the relations of their points to adventitious co-ordinates, the resultbeing an absolutely different and vastly more potent way of handling curves. All our conceptions are what theGermans call Denkmittel, means by which we handle facts by thinking them. Experience merely as such doesn't cometicketed and labelled, we have first to discover what it is. Kant speaks of it as being in its first intention a gewühl dererscheinungen, a rhapsodie der wahrnehmungen, a mere motley which we have to unify by our wits. What we usuallydo is first to frame some system of concepts mentally classified, serialized, or connected in some intellectual way, andthen to use this as a tally by which we 'keep tab' on the impressions that present themselves. When each is referred tosome possible place in the conceptual system, it is thereby 'understood.' This notion of parallel 'manifolds' with theirelements standing reciprocally in 'one-to-one relations,' is proving so convenient nowadays in mathematics and logicas to supersede more and more the older classificatory conceptions. There are many conceptual systems of this sort;and the sense manifold is also such a system. Find a one-to-one relation for your sense-impressions anywhere amongthe concepts, and in so far forth you rationalize the impressions. But obviously you can rationalize them by usingvarious conceptual systems.The old common-sense way of rationalizing them is by a set of concepts of which the most important are these:Thing;The same or different;Kinds;Minds;Bodies;One Time;One Space;Subjects and attributes;Causal influences;"},{"pageNumber":597,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP562 hl[01 03 2011 01 38 41]Page 562The fancied;The real.We are now so familiar with the order that these notions have woven for us out of the everlasting weather of ourperceptions that we find it hard to realize how little of a fixed routine the perceptions follow when taken bythemselves. The word weather is a good one to use here. In Boston, for example, the weather has almost no routine,the only law being that if you have had any weather for two days, you will probably but not certainly have anotherweather on the third. Weather-experience as it thus comes to Boston, is discontinuous and chaotic. In point oftemperature, of wind, rain or sunshine, it may change three times a day. But the Washington weather-bureauintellectualizes this disorder by making each successive bit of Boston weather episodic. It refers it to its place andmoment in a continental cyclone, on the history of which the local changes everywhere are strung as beads are strungupon a cord.Now it seems almost certain that young children and the inferior animals take all their experiences very much asuninstructed Bostonians take their weather. They know no more of time or space as world-receptacles, or ofpermanent subjects and changing predicates, or of causes, or kinds, or thoughts, or things, than our common peopleknow of continental cyclones. A baby's rattle drops out of his hand, but the baby looks not for it. It has 'gone out' forhim, as a candle-flame goes out; and it comes back, when you replace it in his hand, as the flame comes back whenrelit. The idea of its being a 'thing,' whose permanent existence by itself he might interpolate between its successiveapparitions has evidently not occurred to him. It is the same with dogs. Out of sight, out of mind, with them. It ispretty evident that they have no general tendency to interpolate 'things.' Let me quote here a passage from mycolleague G. Santayana's book.''If a dog, while sniffing about contentedly, sees his master arriving after a long absence the poor brute asks for noreason why his master went, why he has come again, why he should be loved, or why presently while lying at his feetyou forget him and begin to grunt and dream of the chase—all that is an utter mystery, utterly unconsidered.

[But] the figures even of that disordered drama have their exits and their entrances; and their cues can begradually discovered by a being capable of fixing his attention and retaining the order of events . In proportion as suchunderstanding advances, each moment of experience becomes consequential and prophetic of the rest. The calm placesin life are filled with power and its spasms with resource. No emotion can overwhelm the mind, for of none is thebasis or issue wholly hidden; no event can disconcert it altogether, because it sees beyond. Means can be looked for toescape from the worst predicament; and whereas each moment had been formerly filled with nothing but its ownadventures and surprised emotion, each now makes room for the lesson of what went before and surmises what maybe the plot of the whole.\"1Even to-day science and philosophy are still laboriously trying to part fancies from realities in our experience; and inprimitive times they made only the most incipient distinctions in this line. Men believed whatever they thought withany liveliness, and they mixed their dreams with their realities inextricably. The categories of 'thought' and 'things' areindispensable here—instead of being realities we now call certain experiences only 'thoughts.' There is not a category,among those enumerated, of which we may not imagine the use to have thus originated historically and only graduallyspread.That one Time which we all believe in and in which each event has its definite date, that one Space in which eachthing has its position, these abstract notions unify the world incomparably; but in their finished shape as concepts howdifferent they are from the loose unordered time-and-space experiences of natural men!

But we soon lose all ourdefinite bearings; and not only do our children make no distinction between yesterday and the day before yesterday,the whole past being churned up together, but we adults still do so whenever the times are large. It is the same withspaces. On a map I can distinctly see the relation of London, Constantinople, and Pekin to the place where I am; inreality I utterly fail to feel the facts which the map symbolizes. The directions and distances are vague, confused andmixed. Cosmic space and cosmic time, so far from being the intuitions that Kant said they were, are constructions aspatently artificial as any that science can show. The great majority of the human race never use these notions, but livein plural times and spaces, interpenetrant and durcheinander.Permanent 'things' again; the 'same' thing and its various 'appearances' and 'alterations'; the different 'kinds' of thing;with the 'kind' used finally as a 'predicate,' of which the thing remains the 'subject'—what a straightening of the tangleof our experience's immediate flux and sensible variety does this list of terms suggest! And it is only the smallest partof his experience's flux that any one actually does straighten out by applying to it these conceptual instruments. Out ofthem all our lowest ancestors probably used only, and then most vaguely and inaccurately, the notion of 'the sameagain.' But even then if you had asked them whether the same were a 'thing' that had endured throughout the unseeninterval, they would probably have been at a loss, and would have said that they had never asked that question, orconsidered matters in that light.Kinds, and sameness of kind—what colossally useful denkmittel for finding our way among the many! The manynessmight conceivably have been absolute. Experiences might have all been singulars, no one of them occurring twice. Insuch a world logic would have had no application; for kind and sameness of kind are logic's only instruments. Oncewe know that whatever is of a kind is also of that kind's kind, we can travel through the universe as if with seven-league boots. Brutes surely never use these abstractions, and civilized men use them in most various amounts."},{"pageNumber":600,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP565 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 01]Page 565Causal influence, again! This, if anything, seems to have been an antediluvian conception; for we find primitive menthinking that almost everything is significant and can exert influence of some sort. The search for the more definiteinfluences seems to have started in the question: \"Who, or what, is to blame?\"—for any illness, namely, or disaster, oruntoward thing. From this centre the search for causal influences has spread. Hume and 'Science' together have triedto eliminate the whole notion of influence, substituting the entirely different denkmittel of 'law.' But law is acomparatively recent invention, and influence reigns supreme in the older realm of common sense.The 'possible,' as something less than the actual and more than the wholly unreal, is another of these magisterialnotions of common sense. Criticise them as you may, they persist; and we fly back to them the moment criticalpressure is relaxed. 'Self,' 'body,' in the substantial or metaphysical sense—no one escapes subjection to those forms ofthought. In practice, the common-sense denkmittel are uniformly victorious. Every one, however instructed, stillthinks of a 'thing' in the common-sense way, as a permanent unit-subject that 'supports' its attributes interchangeably.No one stably or sincerely uses the more critical notion, of a group of sense-qualities united by a law. With thesecategories in our hand, we make our plans and plot together, and connect all the remoter parts of experience with whatlies before our eyes. Our later and more critical philosophies are mere fads and fancies compared with this naturalmother-tongue of thought.Common sense appears thus as a perfectly definite stage in our understanding of things, a stage that satisfies in anextraordinarily successful way the purposes for which we think. 'Things' do exist, even when we do not see them.Their 'kinds' also exist. Their 'qualities' are what they act by, and are what we act on; and these also exist. Theselamps shed their quality of light on every object in this room. We intercept it on its way whenever we hold up anopaque screen.

It suffices for all the necessary practical ends of life;and, among our own race even, it is only the highly sophisticated specimens, the minds debauched by learning, asBerkeley calls them, who have ever even suspected common sense of not being absolutely true.But when we look back, and speculate as to how the common-sense categories may have achieved their wonderfulsupremacy, no reason appears why it may not have been by a process just like that by which the conceptions due toDemocritus, Berkeley, or Darwin, achieved their similar triumphs in more recent times. In other words, they may havebeen successfully discovered by prehistoric geniuses whose names the night of antiquity has covered up; they mayhave been verified by the immediate facts of experience which they first fitted; and then from fact to fact and fromman to man they may have spread, until all language rested on them and we are now incapable of thinking naturallyin any other terms. Such a view would only follow the rule that has proved elsewhere so fertile, of assuming the vastand remote to conform to the laws of formation that we can observe at work in the small and near.For all utilitarian practical purposes these conceptions amply suffice; but that they began at special points of discoveryand only gradually spread from one thing to another, seems proved by the exceedingly dubious limits of theirapplication to-day. We assume for certain purposes one 'objective' Time that aequabiliter fluit, but we don't livinglybelieve in or realize any such equally-flowing time. 'Space' is a less vague notion; but 'things,' what are they? Is aconstellation properly a thing? or an army? or is an ens rationis such as space or justice a thing? Is a knife whosehandle and blade are changed the 'same'? Is the 'changeling,' whom Locke so seriously discusses, of the human 'kind'?Is 'telepathy' a 'fancy' or a 'fact'? The moment you pass beyond the practical use of these categories (a use usuallysuggested sufficiently by the circumstances of the special case) to a merely curious or speculative way of thinking,you find it impossible to say within just what limits of fact any one of them shall apply.The peripatetic philosophy, obeying rationalist propensi-"},{"pageNumber":602,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP567 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 04]Page 567ties, has tried to eternalize the common-sense categories by treating them very technically and articulately. A 'thing'for instance is a being, or ens. An ens is a subject in which qualities 'inhere.' A subject is a substance. Substances areof kinds, and kinds are definite in number, and discrete. These distinctions are fundamental and eternal. As terms ofdiscourse they are indeed magnificently useful, but what they mean, apart from their use in steering our discourse toprofitable issues, does not appear. If you ask a scholastic philosopher what a substance may be in itself, apart from itsbeing the support of attributes, he simply says that your intellect knows perfectly what the word means.But what the intellect knows clearly is only the word itself and its steering function. So it comes about that intellectssibi permissi, intellects only curious and idle, have forsaken the common-sense level for what in general terms maybe called the 'critical' level of thought. Not merely such intellects either—your Humes and Berkeleys and Hegels; butpractical observers of facts, your Galileos, Daltons, Faradays, have found it impossible to treat the naifs sense-terminiof common sense as ultimately real. As common sense interpolates her constant 'things' between our intermittentsensations, so science extrapolates her world of 'primary' qualities, her atoms, her ether, her magnetic fields, and thelike, beyond the common-sense world. The 'things' are now invisible impalpable things; and the old visible common-sense things are supposed to result from the mixture of these invisibles. Or else the whole naif conception of thinggets superseded, and a thing's name is interpreted as denoting only the law or regel der verbindung by which certainof our sensations habitually succeed or coexist.Science and critical philosophy thus burst the bounds of common sense. With science naif realism ceases: 'Secondary'qualities become unreal; primary ones alone remain. With critical philosophy, havoc is made of everything. Thecommon-sense categories one and all cease to represent anything in the way of being; they are but sublime tricks ofhuman thought, our ways of escaping bewilderment in the midst of sensation's irremediable flow.But the scientific tendency in critical thought, tho inspired"},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP568 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 05]Page 568at first by purely intellectual motives, has opened an entirely unexpected range of practical utilities to our astonishedview. Galileo gave us accurate clocks and accurate artillery-practice; the chemists flood us with new medicines anddye-stuffs; Ampère and Faraday have endowed us with the New York subway and with Marconi telegrams. Thehypothetical things that such men have invented, defined as they have defined them, are showing an extraordinaryfertility in consequences verifiable by sense. Our logic can deduce from them a consequence due under certainconditions, we can then bring about the conditions, and presto, the consequence is there before our eyes. The scope ofthe practical control of nature newly put into our hand by scientific ways of thinking vastly exceeds the scope of theold control grounded on common sense. Its rate of increase accelerates so that no one can trace the limit; one mayeven fear that the being of man may be crushed by his own powers, that his fixed nature as an organism may notprove adequate to stand the strain of the ever increasingly tremendous functions, almost divine creative functions,which his intellect will more and more enable him to wield. He may drown in his wealth like a child in a bath-tub,who has turned on the water and who can not turn it off.The philosophic stage of criticism, much more thorough in its negations than the scientific stage, so far gives us nonew range of practical power. Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, have all been utterly sterile, so far as sheddingany light on the details of nature goes, and I can think of no invention or discovery that can be directly traced toanything in their peculiar thought, for neither with Berkeley's tar-water nor with Kant's nebular hypothesis had theirrespective philosophic tenets anything to do. The satisfactions they yield to their disciples are intellectual, notpractical; and even then we have to confess that there is a large minus-side to the account.There are thus at least three well-characterized levels, stages or types of thought about the world we live in, and thenotions of one stage have one kind of merit, those of another stage another kind. It is impossible, however, to say thatany stage as yet in sight is absolutely more true than any other. Common sense is the more consolidated stage,because it got its innings first, and made all language into its ally. Whether"},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP569 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 06]Page 569it or science be the more august stage may be left to private judgment. But neither consolidation nor augustness aredecisive marks of truth. If common sense were true, why should science have had to brand the secondary qualities, towhich our world owes all its living interest, as false, and to invent an invisible world of points and curves andmathematical equations instead? Why should it have needed to transform causes and activities into laws of 'functionalvariation'? Vainly did scholasticism, common sense's college-trained younger sister, seek to stereotype the forms thehuman family had always talked with, to make them definite and fix them for eternity. Substantial forms (in otherwords our secondary qualities) hardly outlasted the year of our Lord 1600. People were already tired of them then;and Galileo, and Descartes, with his 'new philosophy,' gave them only a little later their coup de grâce.But now if the new kinds of scientific 'thing,' the corpuscular and etheric world, were essentially more 'true,' whyshould they have excited so much criticism within the body of science itself? Scientific logicians are saying on everyhand that these entities and their determinations, however definitely conceived, should not be held for literally real. Itis as if they existed; but in reality they are like co-ordinates or logarithms, only artificial short-cuts for taking us fromone part to another of experience's flux. We can cipher fruitfully with them; they serve us wonderfully; but we mustnot be their dupes.There is no ringing conclusion possible when we compare these types of thinking, with a view to telling which is themore absolutely true. Their naturalness, their intellectual economy, their fruitfulness for practice, all start up as distincttests of their veracity, and as a result we get confused. Common sense is better for one sphere of life, science foranother, philosophic criticism for a third; but whether either be truer absolutely, Heaven only knows. Just now, if Iunderstand the matter rightly, we are witnessing a curious reversion to the common sense way of looking at physicalnature, in the philosophy of science favored by such men as Mach, Ostwald and Duhem.

They are all but ways of talking on our part, to be compared solely from the point of view of their use. Theonly literally true thing is reality; and the only reality we know is, for these logicians, sensible reality, the flux of oursensations and emotions as they pass. 'Energy' is the collective name (according to Ostwald) for the sensations just asthey present themselves (the movement, heat, magnetic pull, or light, or whatever it may be) when they are measuredin certain ways. So measuring them, we are enabled to describe the correlated changes which they show us, informulas matchless for their simplicity and fruitfulness for human use. They are sovereign triumphs of economy inthought.No one can fail to admire the 'energetic' philosophy. But the hypersensible entities, the corpuscles and vibrations, holdtheir own with most physicists and chemists, in spite of its appeal. It seems too economical to be all-sufficient.Profusion, not economy, may after all be reality's key-note.I am dealing here with highly technical matters, hardly suitable for popular lecturing, and in which my owncompetence is small. All the better for my conclusion, however, which at this point is this. The whole notion of truth,which naturally and without reflexion we assume to mean the simple duplication by the mind of a ready-made andgiven reality, proves hard to understand clearly. There is no simple test available for adjudicating offhand between thedivers types of thought that claim to possess it. Common sense, common science or corpuscular philosophy, ultra-critical science, or energetics, and critical or idealistic philosophy, all seem insufficiently true in some regard andleave some dissatisfaction. It is evident that the conflict of these so widely differing systems obliges us to overhaul thevery idea of truth, for at present we have no definite notion of what the word may mean. I shall face that task in mynext lecture, and will add but a few words, in finishing the present one.There are only two points that I wish you to retain from the present lecture. The first one relates to common sense. Wehave seen reason to suspect it, to suspect that in spite of their being so venerable, of their being so universally usedand built into the very structure of language, its categories may after all be only a collection of extraordinarilysuccessful"},{"pageNumber":606,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP571 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 09]Page 571hypotheses (historically discovered or invented by single men, but gradually communicated, and used by everybody)by which our forefathers have from time immemorial unified and straightened the discontinuity of their immediateexperiences, and put themselves into an equilibrium with the surface of nature so satisfactory for ordinary practicalpurposes that it certainly would have lasted forever, but for the excessive intellectual vivacity of Democritus,Archimedes, Galileo, Berkeley, and other excentric geniuses whom the example of such men inflamed. Retain, I prayyou, this suspicion about common sense.The other point is this. Ought not the existence of the various types of thinking which we have reviewed, each sosplendid for certain purposes, yet all conflicting still, and neither one of them able to support a claim of absoluteveracity, to awaken a presumption favorable to the pragmatistic view that all our theories are instrumental, are mentalmodes of adaptation to reality, rather than revelations or gnostic answers to some divinely instituted world-enigma? Iexpressed this view as clearly as I could in the second of these lectures. Certainly the restlessness of the actualtheoretic situation, the value for some purposes of each thought-level, and the inability of either to expel the othersdecisively, suggest this pragmatistic view, which I hope that the next lectures may soon make entirely convincing.May there not after all be a possible ambiguity in truth?"},{"pageNumber":607,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP572 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 10]Page 572Lecture VIPragmatism's Conception of TruthWhen Clerk-Maxwell was a child it is written that he had a mania for having everything explained to him, and thatwhen people put him off with vague verbal accounts of any phenomenon he would interrupt them impatiently bysaying, 'Yes; but I want you to tell me the particular go' of it!' Had his question been about truth, only a pragmatistcould have told him the particular go of it. I believe that our contemporary pragmatists, especially Messrs. Schillerand Dewey, have given the only tenable account of this subject. It is a very ticklish subject, sending subtle rootlets intoall kinds of crannies, and hard to treat in the sketchy way that alone befits a public lecture. But the Schiller-Deweyview of truth has been so ferociously attacked by rationalistic philosophers, and so abominably misunderstood, thathere, if anywhere, is the point where a clear and simple statement should be made.I fully expect to see the pragmatist view of truth run through the classic stages of a theory's career. First, you know, anew theory is attacked as absurd; then it is admitted to be true, but obvious and insignificant; finally it is seen to be soimportant that its adversaries claim that they themselves discovered it. Our doctrine of truth is at present in the first ofthese three stages, with symptoms of the second stage having begun in certain quarters. I wish that this lecture mighthelp it beyond the first stage in the eyes of many of you.Truth, as any dictionary will tell you, is a property of certain of our ideas. It means their 'agreement,' as falsity meanstheir disagreement, with 'reality.' Pragmatists and intellectualists both accept this definition as a matter of course. Theybegin to quarrel only after the question is raised as to what may precisely be meant by the term 'agreement,' and whatby the term 'reality,' when reality is taken as something for our ideas to agree with.In answering these questions the pragmatists are more analytic and painstaking, the intellectualists more offhand andirreflective. The popular notion is that a true idea must copy"},{"pageNumber":608,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP573 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 11]Page 573its reality. Like other popular views, this one follows the analogy of the most usual experience. Our true ideas ofsensible things do indeed copy them. Shut your eyes and think of yonder clock on the wall, and you get just such atrue picture or copy of its dial. But your idea of its 'works' (unless you are a clock-maker) is much less of a copy, yetit passes muster, for it in no way clashes with the reality. Even though it should shrink to the mere word 'works,' thatword still serves you truly; and when you speak of the 'time-keeping function' of the clock, or of its spring's'elasticity,' it is hard to see exactly what your ideas can copy.You perceive that there is a problem here. Where our ideas cannot copy definitely their object, what does agreementwith that object mean? Some idealists seem to say that they are true whenever they are what God means that we oughtto think about that object. Others hold the copy-view all through, and speak as if our ideas possessed truth just inproportion as they approach to being copies of the Absolute's eternal way of thinking.These views, you see, invite pragmatistic discussion. But the great assumption of the intellectualists is that truth meansessentially an inert static relation. When you've got your true idea of anything, there's an end of the matter. You're inpossession; you know; you have fulfilled your thinking destiny. You are where you ought to be mentally; you haveobeyed your categorical imperative; and nothing more need follow on that climax of your rational destiny.Epistemologically you are in stable equilibrium.Pragmatism, on the other hand, asks its usual question. ''Grant an idea or belief to be true,\" it says, \"what concretedifference will its being true make in any one's actual life? How will the truth be realized? What experiences will bedifferent from those which would obtain if the belief were false? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value inexperiential terms?\"The moment pragmatism asks this question, it sees the answer: True ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate,corroborate and verify. False ideas are those that we can not. That is the practical difference it makes to us to havetrue ideas; that, therefore, is the meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known-as."},{"pageNumber":609,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP574 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 12]Page 574This thesis is what I have to defend. The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth happens to anidea. It becomes true, is made true by events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process: the process namely of itsverifying itself, its veri-fication. Its validity is the process of its valid-ation.But what do the words verification and validation themselves pragmatically mean? They again signify certainpractical consequences of the verified and validated idea. It is hard to find any one phrase that characterizes theseconsequences better than the ordinary agreement-formula—just such consequences being what we have in mindwhenever we say that our ideas 'agree' with reality. They lead us, namely, through the acts and other ideas which theyinstigate, into or up to, or towards, other parts of experience with which we feel all the while—such feeling beingamong our potentialities—that the original ideas remain in agreement. The connexions and transitions come to us frompoint to point as being progressive, harmonious, satisfactory. This function of agreeable leading is what we mean byan idea's verification. Such an account is vague and it sounds at first quite trivial, but it has results which it will takethe rest of my hour to explain.Let me begin by reminding you of the fact that the possession of true thoughts means everywhere the possession ofinvaluable instruments of action; and that our duty to gain truth, so far from being a blank command from out of theblue, or a 'stunt' self-imposed by our intellect, can account for itself by excellent practical reasons.The importance to human life of having true beliefs about matters of fact is a thing too notorious. We live in a worldof realities that can be infinitely useful or infinitely harmful. Ideas that tell us which of them to expect count as thetrue ideas in all this primary sphere of verification, and the pursuit of such ideas is a primary human duty. Thepossession of truth, so far from being here an end in itself, is only a preliminary means towards other vitalsatisfactions. If I am lost in the woods and starved, and find what looks like a cow-path, it is of the utmost importancethat I should think of a human habitation at the end of it, for it I do so and follow it, I save"},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"Document Page 575myself. The true thought is useful here because the house which is its object is useful. The practical value of true ideasis thus primarily derived from the practical importance of their objects to us. Their objects are, indeed, not importantat all times. I may on another occasion have no use for the house; and then my idea of it, however verifiable, will bepractically irrelevant, and had better remain latent. Yet since almost any object may some day become temporarilyimportant, the advantage of having a general stock of extra truths, of ideas that shall be true of merely possiblesituations, is obvious. We store such extra truths away in our memories, and with the overflow we fill our books ofreference. Whenever such an extra truth becomes practically relevant to one of our emergencies, it passes from cold-storage to do work in the world and our belief in it grows active. You can say of it then either that 'it is useful becauseit is true' or that 'it is true because it is useful.' Both these phrases mean exactly the same thing, namely that here is anidea that gets fulfilled and can be verified. True is the name for whatever idea starts the verification-process, useful isthe name for its completed function in experience. True ideas would never have been singled out as such, would neverhave acquired a class-name, least of all a name suggesting value, unless they had been useful from the outset in thisway.From this simple cue pragmatism gets her general notion of truth as something essentially bound up with the way inwhich one moment in our experience may lead us towards other moments which it will be worth while to have beenled to. Primarily, and on the common-sense level, the truth of a state of mind means this function of a leading that isworth while. When a moment in our experience, of any kind whatever, inspires us with a thought that is true, thatmeans that sooner or later we dip by that thought's guidance into the particulars of experience again and makeadvantageous connexion with them. This is a vague enough statement, but I beg you to retain it, for it is essential.Our experience meanwhile is all shot through with regularities. One bit of it can warn us to get ready for another bit,can 'intend' or be 'significant of' that remoter object. The"},{"pageNumber":611,"pageContent":" Page 576object's advent is the significance's verification. Truth, in these cases, meaning nothing but eventual verification, ismanifestly incompatible with waywardness on our part. Woe to him whose beliefs play fast and loose with the orderwhich realities follow in his experience; they will lead him nowhere or else make false connexions.By 'realities' or 'objects' here, we mean either things of common sense, sensibly present, or else common-senserelations, such as dates, places, distances, kinds, activities. Following our mental image of a house along the cow-path, we actually come to see the house; we get the image's full verification. Such simply and fully verified leadingsare certainly the originals and prototypes of the truth-process. Experience offers indeed other forms of truth-process,but they are all conceivable as being primary verifications arrested, multiplied or substituted one for another.Take, for instance, yonder object on the wall. You and I consider it to be a 'clock,' altho no one of us has seen thehidden works that make it one. We let our notion pass for true without attempting to verify. If truths meanverification-process essentially, ought we then to call such unverified truths as this abortive? No, for they form theoverwhelmingly large number of the truths we live by. Indirect as well as direct verifications pass muster. Wherecircumstantial evidence is sufficient, we can go without eye-witnessing. Just as we here assume Japan to exist withoutever having been there, because it works to do so, everything we know conspiring with the belief, and nothinginterfering, so we assume that thing to be a clock. We use it as a clock, regulating the length of our lecture by it. Theverification of the assumption here means its leading to no frustration or contradiction. Verifi-ability of wheels andweights and pendulum is as good as verification. For one truth-process completed there are a million in our lives thatfunction in this state of nascency. They turn us towards direct verification; lead us into the surroundings of the objectsthey envisage; and then, if everything runs on harmoniously, we are so sure that verification is possible that we omit it,and are usually justified by all that happens.Truth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system. Our thoughts and beliefs 'pass,' so long as nothing challenges"},{"pageNumber":612,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP577 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 14]Page 577them, just as bank-notes pass so long as nobody refuses them. But this all points to direct face-to-face verificationssomewhere, without which the fabric of truth collapses like a financial system with no cash-basis whatever. Youaccept my verification of one thing, I yours of another. We trade on each other's truth. But beliefs verified concretelyby somebody are the posts of the whole superstructure.Another great reason—beside economy of time—for waiving complete verification in the usual business of life is thatall things exist in kinds and not singly. Our world is found once for all to have that peculiarity. So that when we haveonce directly verified our ideas about one specimen of a kind, we consider ourselves free to apply them to otherspecimens without verification. A mind that habitually discerns the kind of thing before it, and acts by the law of thekind immediately, without pausing to verify, will be a 'true' mind in ninety-nine out of a hundred emergencies, provedso by its conduct fitting everything it meets, and getting no refutation.Indirectly or only potentially verifying processes may thus be true as well as full verification-processes. They work astrue processes would work, give us the same advantages, and claim our recognition for the same reasons. All this onthe common-sense level of matters of fact, which we are alone considering.But matters of fact are not our only stock in trade. Relations among purely mental ideas form another sphere wheretrue and false beliefs obtain, and here the beliefs are absolute, or unconditional. When they are true they bear the nameeither of definitions or of principles. It is either a principle or a definition that 1 and 1 make 2, that 2 and 1 make 3,and so on; that white differs less from gray than it does from black; that when the cause begins to act the effect alsocommences. Such propositions hold of all possible 'ones,' of all conceivable 'whites' and 'grays' and 'causes.' Theobjects here are mental objects. Their relations are perceptually obvious at a glance, and no sense-verification isnecessary. Moreover, once true, always true, of those same mental objects. Truth here has an 'eternal' character. If youcan find a concrete thing anywhere that is 'one' or 'white' or 'gray' or an 'effect,' then your prin-"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP578 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 16]Page 578ciples will everlastingly apply to it. It is but a case of ascertaining the kind, and then applying the law of its kind tothe particular object. You are sure to get truth if you can but name the kind rightly, for your mental relations holdgood of everything of that kind without exception. If you then, nevertheless, failed to get truth concretely, you wouldsay that you had classed your real objects wrongly.In this realm of mental relations, truth again is an affair of leading. We relate one abstract idea with another, framingin the end great systems of logical and mathematical truth, under the respective terms of which the sensible facts ofexperience eventually arrange themselves, so that our eternal truths hold good of realities also. This marriage of factand theory is endlessly fertile. What we say is here already true in advance of special verification, if we havesubsumed our objects rightly. Our ready-made ideal framework for all sorts of possible objects follows from the verystructure of our thinking. We can no more play fast and loose with these abstract relations than we can do so with oursense-experiences. They coerce us; we must treat them consistently, whether or not we like the results. The rules ofaddition apply to our debts as rigorously as to our assets. The hundredth decimal of p, the ratio of the circumference toits diameter, is predetermined ideally now, tho no one may have computed it. If we should ever need the figure in ourdealings with an actual circle we should need to have it given rightly, calculated by the usual rules; for it is the samekind of truth that those rules elsewhere calculate.Between the coercions of the sensible order and those of the ideal order, our mind is thus wedged tightly. Our ideasmust agree with realities, be such realities concrete or abstract, be they facts or be they principles, under penalty ofendless inconsistency and frustration.So far, intellectualists can raise no protest. They can only say that we have barely touched the skin of the matter.Realities mean, then, either concrete facts, or abstract kinds of things and relations perceived intuitively betweenthem. They furthermore and thirdly mean, as things that new ideas of ours must no less take account of, the wholebody of other truths already in our possession. But what now does 'agree-"},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP579 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 17]Page 579ment' with such threefold realities mean?—to use again the definition that is current.Here it is that pragmatism and intellectualism begin to part company. Primarily, no doubt, to agree means to copy, butwe saw that the mere word 'clock' would do instead of a mental picture of its works, and that of many realities ourideas can only be symbols and not copies. 'Past time,' 'power,' 'spontaneity,'—how can our mind copy such realities?To 'agree' in the widest sense with a reality can only mean to be guided either straight up to it or into itssurroundings, or to be put into such working touch with it as to handle either it or something connected with it betterthan if we disagreed. Better either intellectually or practically! And often agreement will only mean the negative factthat nothing contradictory from the quarter of that reality comes to interfere with the way in which our ideas guide uselsewhere. To copy a reality is, indeed, one very important way of agreeing with it, but it is far from being essential.The essential thing is the process of being guided. Any idea that helps us to deal, whether practically or intellectually,with either the reality or its belongings, that doesn't entangle our progress in frustrations, that fits, in fact, and adaptsour life to the reality's whole setting, will agree sufficiently to meet the requirement. It will hold true of that reality.Thus, names are just as 'true' or 'false' as definite mental pictures are. They set up similar verification-processes, andlead to fully equivalent practical results.All human thinking gets discursified; we exchange ideas; we lend and borrow verifications, get them from one anotherby means of social intercourse. All truth thus gets verbally built out, stored up, and made available for every one.Hence, we must talk consistently just as we must think consistently: for both in talk and thought we deal with kinds.Names are arbitrary, but once understood they must be kept to. We mustn't now call Abel 'Cain' or Cain 'Abel.' If wedo, we ungear ourselves from the whole book of Genesis, and from all its connexions with the universe of speech andfact down to the present time. We throw ourselves out of whatever truth that entire system of speech and fact mayembody.The overwhelming majority of our true ideas admit of no"},{"pageNumber":615,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP580 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 34]Page 580direct or face-to-face verification—those of past history, for example, as of Cain and Abel. The stream of time can beremounted only verbally, or verified indirectly by the present prolongations or effects of what the past harbored. Yet ifthey agree with these verbalities and effects, we can know that our ideas of the past are true. As true as past time itselfwas, so true was Julius Cæsar, so true were antediluvian monsters, all in their proper dates and settings. That past timeitself was, is guaranteed by its coherence with everything that's present. True as the present is, the past was also.Agreement thus turns out to be essentially an affair of leading—leading that is useful because it is into quarters thatcontain objects that are important. True ideas lead us into useful verbal and conceptual quarters as well as directly upto useful sensible termini. They lead to consistency, stability and flowing human intercourse. They lead away fromexcentricity and isolation, from foiled and barren thinking. The untrammelled flowing of the leading-process, itsgeneral freedom from clash and contradiction, passes for its indirect verification; but all roads lead to Rome, and inthe end and eventually, all true processes must lead to the face of directly verifying sensible experiences somewhere,which somebody's ideas have copied.Such is the large loose way in which the pragmatist interprets the word agreement. He treats it altogether practically.He lets it cover any process of conduction from a present idea to a future terminus, provided only it run prosperously.It is only thus that 'scientific' ideas, flying as they do beyond common sense, can be said to agree with their realities. Itis, as I have already said, as if reality were made of ether, atoms or electrons, but we must n't think so literally. Theterm 'energy' does n't even pretend to stand for anything 'objective.' It is only a way of measuring the surface ofphenomena so as to string their changes on a simple formula.Yet in the choice of these man-made formulas we can not be capricious with impunity any more than we can becapricious on the common-sense practical level. We must find a theory that will work; and that means somethingextremely difficult; for our theory must mediate between all previous truths and certain new experiences. It mustderange common"},{"pageNumber":616,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP581 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 35]Page 581sense and previous belief as little as possible, and it must lead to some sensible terminus or other that can be verifiedexactly. To 'work' means both these things; and the squeeze is so tight that there is little loose play for any hypothesis.Our theories are wedged and controlled as nothing else is. Yet sometimes alternative theoretic formulas are equallycompatible with all the truths we know, and then we choose between them for subjective reasons. We choose the kindof theory to which we are already partial; we follow 'elegance' or 'economy.' Clerk-Maxwell somewhere says it wouldbe 'poor scientific taste' to choose the more complicated of two equally well-evidenced conceptions; and you will allagree with him. Truth in science is what gives us the maximum possible sum of satisfactions, taste included, butconsistency both with previous truth and with novel fact is always the most imperious claimant.I have led you through a very sandy desert. But now, if I may be allowed so vulgar an expression, we begin to tastethe milk in the cocoanut. Our rationalist critics here discharge their batteries upon us, and to reply to them will take usout from all this dryness into full sight of a momentous philosophical alternative.Our account of truth is an account of truths in the plural, of processes of leading, realized in rebus, and having onlythis quality in common, that they pay. They pay by guiding us into or towards some part of a system that dips atnumerous points into sense-percepts, which we may copy mentally or not, but with which at any rate we are now inthe kind of commerce vaguely designated as verification. Truth for us is simply a collective name for verification-processes, just as health, wealth, strength, etc., are names for other processes connected with life, and also pursuedbecause it pays to pursue them. Truth is made, just as health, wealth and strength are made, in the course ofexperience.Here rationalism is instantaneously up in arms against us. I can imagine a rationalist to talk as follows:\"Truth is not made,\" he will say; \"it absolutely obtains, being a unique relation that does not wait upon any process,but shoots straight over the head of experience, and hits its"},{"pageNumber":617,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP582 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 36]Page 582reality every time. Our belief that yon thing on the wall is a clock is true already, altho no one in the whole history ofthe world should verify it. The bare quality of standing in that transcendent relation is what makes any thought truethat possesses it, whether or not there be verification. You pragmatists put the cart before the horse in making truth'sbeing reside in verification-processes. These are merely signs of its being, merely our lame ways of ascertaining afterthe fact, which of our ideas already has possessed the wondrous quality. The quality itself is timeless, like all essencesand natures. Thoughts partake of it directly, as they partake of falsity or of irrelevancy. It can't be analyzed away intopragmatic consequences.\"The whole plausibility of this rationalist tirade is due to the fact to which we have already paid so much attention. Inour world, namely, abounding as it does in things of similar kinds and similarly associated, one verification serves forothers of its kind, and one great use of knowing things is to be led not so much to them as to their associates,especially to human talk about them. The quality of truth, obtaining ante rem, pragmatically means, then, the fact thatin such a world innumerable ideas work better by their indirect or possible than by their direct and actual verification.Truth ante rem means only verifiability, then; or else it is a case of the stock rationalist trick of treating the name of aconcrete phenomenal reality as an independent prior entity, and placing it behind the reality as its explanation.Professor Mach quotes somewhere an epigram of Lessing's:Sagt Hänschen Schlau zu Vetter Fritz,\"Wie kommt es, Vetter Fritzen,Dass grad' die Reichsten in der Welt,Das meiste Geld besitzen?\"Hänschen Schlau here treats the principle 'wealth' as something distinct from the facts denoted by the man's beingrich. It antedates them; the facts become only a sort of secondary coincidence with the rich man's essential nature.In the case of 'wealth' we all see the fallacy. We know that wealth is but a name for concrete processes that certainmen's"},{"pageNumber":618,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP583 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 38]Page 583lives play a part in, and not a natural excellence found in Messrs. Rockefeller and Carnegie, but not in the rest of us.Like wealth, health also lives in rebus. It is a name for processes, as digestion, circulation, sleep, etc., that go onhappily, tho in this instance we are more inclined to think of it as a principle and to say the man digests and sleeps sowell because he is so healthy.With 'strength' we are, I think, more rationalistic still, and decidedly inclined to treat it as an excellence pre-existing inthe man and explanatory of the herculean performances of his muscles.With 'truth' most people go over the border entirely, and treat the rationalistic account as self-evident. But really allthese words in th are exactly similar. Truth exists ante rem just as much and as little as the other things do.The scholastics, following Aristotle, made much of the distinction between habit and act. Health in actu means, amongother things, good sleeping and digesting. But a healthy man need not always be sleeping, or always digesting, anymore than a wealthy man need be always handling money, or a strong man always lifting weights. All such qualitiessink to the status of 'habits' between their times of exercise; and similarly truth becomes a habit of certain of our ideasand beliefs in their intervals of rest from their verifying activities. But those activities are the root of the whole matter,and the condition of there being any habit to exist in the intervals.'The true,' to put it very briefly, is only the expedient in the way of our thinking, just as 'the right' is only the expedientin the way of our behaving. Expedient in almost any fashion; and expedient in the long run and on the whole ofcourse; for what meets expediently all the experience in sight won't necessarily meet all farther experiences equallysatisfactorily. Experience, as we know, has ways of boiling over, and making us correct our present formulas.The 'absolutely' true, meaning what no farther experience will ever alter, is that ideal vanishing-point towards whichwe imagine that all our temporary truths will some day converge. It runs on all fours with the perfectly wise man, andwith the absolutely complete experience; and, if these ideals are ever realized, they will all be realized together.Meanwhile we have"},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP584 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 39]Page 584to live to-day by what truth we can get to-day, and be ready to-morrow to call it falsehood. Ptolemaic astronomy,euclidean space, aristotelian logic, scholastic metaphysics, were expedient for centuries, but human experience hasboiled over those limits, and we now call these things only relatively true, or true within those borders of experience.'Absolutely' they are false; for we know that those limits were casual, and might have been transcended by pasttheorists just as they are by present thinkers.When new experiences lead to retrospective judgments, using the past tense, what these judgments utter was true, eventho no past thinker had been led there. We live forwards, a Danish thinker has said, but we understand backwards. Thepresent sheds a backward light on the world's previous processes. They may have been truth-processes for the actorsin them. They are not so for one who knows the later revelations of the story.This regulative notion of a potential better truth to be established later, possibly to be established some day absolutely,and having powers of retroactive legislation, turns its face, like all pragmatist notions, towards concreteness of fact,and towards the future. Like the half-truths, the absolute truth will have to be made, made as a relation incidental tothe growth of a mass of verification-experience, to which the half-true ideas are all along contributing their quota.I have already insisted on the fact that truth is made largely out of previous truths. Men's beliefs at any time are somuch experience funded. But the beliefs are themselves parts of the sum total of the world's experience, and becomematter, therefore, for the next day's funding operations. So far as reality means experienceable reality, both it and thetruths men gain about it are everlastingly in process of mutation—mutation towards a definite goal, it may be—butstill mutation.Mathematicians can solve problems with two variables. On the Newtonian theory, for instance, acceleration varieswith distance, but distance also varies with acceleration. In the realm of truth-processes facts come independently anddetermine our beliefs provisionally. But these beliefs make us act, and as fast as they do so, they bring into sight orinto"},{"pageNumber":620,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP585 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 41]Page 585existence new facts which re-determine the beliefs accordingly. So the whole coil and ball of truth, as it rolls up, is theproduct of a double influence. Truths emerge from facts; but they dip forward into facts again and add to them; whichfacts again create or reveal new truth (the word is indifferent) and so on indefinitely. The 'facts' themselves meanwhileare not true. They simply are. Truth is the function of the beliefs that start and terminate among them.The case is like a snowball's growth, due as it is to the distribution of the snow on the one hand, and to the successivepushes of the boys on the other, with these factors codetermining each other incessantly.The most fateful point of difference between being a rationalist and being a pragmatist is now fully in sight.Experience is in mutation, and our psychological ascertainments of truth are in mutation—so much rationalism willallow; but never that either reality itself or truth itself is mutable. Reality stands complete and ready-made from alleternity, rationalism insists, and the agreement of our ideas with it is that unique unanalyzable virtue in them of whichshe has already told us. As that intrinsic excellence, their truth has nothing to do with our experiences. It adds nothingto the content of experience. It makes no difference to reality itself; it is supervenient, inert, static, a reflexion merely.It doesn't exist, it holds or obtains, it belongs to another dimension from that of either facts or fact-relations, belongs,in short, to the epistemological dimension—and with that big word rationalism closes the discussion.Thus, just as pragmatism faces forward to the future, so does rationalism here again face backward to a past eternity.True to her inveterate habit, rationalism reverts to 'principles,' and thinks that when an abstraction once is named, weown an oracular solution.The tremendous pregnancy in the way of consequences for life of this radical difference of outlook will only becomeapparent in my later lectures. I wish meanwhile to close this lecture by showing that rationalism's sublimity does notsave it from inanity."},{"pageNumber":621,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP586 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 43]Page 586When, namely, you ask rationalists, instead of accusing pragmatism of desecrating the notion of truth, to define itthemselves by saying exactly what they understand by it, the only positive attempts I can think of are these two:1. ''Truth is the system of propositions which have an unconditional claim to be recognized as valid.\"12. Truth is a name for all those judgments which we find ourselves under obligation to make by a kind of imperativeduty.2The first thing that strikes one in such definitions is their unutterable triviality. They are absolutely true, of course, butabsolutely insignificant until you handle them pragmatically. What do you mean by 'claim' here, and what do youmean by 'duty'? As summary names for the concrete reasons why thinking in true ways is overwhelmingly expedientand good for mortal men, it is all right to talk of claims on reality's part to be agreed with, and of obligations on ourpart to agree. We feel both the claims and the obligations, and we feel them for just those reasons.But the rationalists who talk of claim and obligation expressly say that they have nothing to do with our practicalinterests or personal reasons. Our reasons for agreeing are psychological facts, they say, relative to each thinker, andto the accidents of his life. They are his evidence merely, they are no part of the life of truth itself. That life transactsitself in a purely logical or epistemological, as distinguished from a psychological, dimension, and its claims antedateand exceed all personal motivations whatsoever. Tho neither man nor God should ever ascertain truth, the word wouldstill have to be defined as that which ought to be ascertained and recognized.There never was a more exquisite example of an idea abstracted from the concretes of experience and then used tooppose and negate what it was abstracted from.Philosophy and common life abound in similar instances. The 'sentimentalist fallacy' is to shed tears over abstractjustice and generosity, beauty, etc., and never to know these qualities when you meet them in the street, because therethe1A. E. Taylor, Philosophical Review, vol. xiv, p. 288.2H.

Thus I read in the privately printed biography of an eminently rationalistic mind: \"Itwas strange that with such admiration for beauty in the abstract, my brother had no enthusiasm for fine architecture,for beautiful painting, or for flowers.\" And in almost the last philosophic work I have read, I find such passages as thefollowing: \"Justice is ideal, solely ideal. Reason conceives that it ought to exist, but experience shows that it can not. Truth, which ought to be, can not be . Reason is deformed by experience. As soon as reason enters experience itbecomes contrary to reason.\"The rationalist's fallacy here is exactly like the sentimentalist's. Both extract a quality from the muddy particulars ofexperience, and find it so pure when extracted that they contrast it with each and all its muddy instances as anopposite and higher nature. All the while it is their nature. It is the nature of truths to be validated, verified. It pays forour ideas to be validated. Our obligation to seek truth is part of our general obligation to do what pays. The paymentstrue ideas bring are the sole why of our duty to follow them.Identical whys exist in the case of wealth and health. Truth makes no other kind of claim and imposes no other kind ofought than health and wealth do. All these claims are conditional; the concrete benefits we gain are what we mean bycalling the pursuit a duty. In the case of truth, untrue beliefs work as perniciously in the long run as true beliefs workbeneficially. Talking abstractly, the quality 'true' may thus be said to grow absolutely precious and the quality 'untrue'absolutely damnable: the one may be called good, the other bad, unconditionally. We ought to think the true, we oughtto shun the false, imperatively.But if we treat all this abstraction literally and oppose it to its mother soil in experience, see what a preposterousposition we work ourselves into.We can not then take a step forward in our actual thinking. When shall I acknowledge this truth and when that? Shallthe acknowledgment be loud?—or silent? If sometimes loud, sometimes silent, which now? When may a truth go intocold-storage in the encyclopedia? and when shall it come out for battle? Must I constantly be repeating the truth'twice two are"},{"pageNumber":623,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP588 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 45]Page 588four' because of its eternal claim on recognition? or is it sometimes irrelevant? Must my thoughts dwell night and dayon my personal sins and blemishes, because I truly have them?—or may I sink and ignore them in order to be adecent social unit, and not a mass of morbid melancholy and apology?It is quite evident that our obligation to acknowledge truth, so far from being unconditional, is tremendouslyconditioned. Truth with a big T, and in the singular, claims abstractly to be recognized, of course; but concrete truthsin the plural need be recognized only when their recognition is expedient. A truth must always be preferred to afalsehood when both relate to the situation; but when neither does, truth is as little of a duty as falsehood. If you askme what o'clock it is and I tell you that I live at 95 Irving Street, my answer may indeed be true, but you don't seewhy it is my duty to give it. A false address would be as much to the purpose.With this admission that there are conditions that limit the application of the abstract imperative, the pragmatistictreatment of truth sweeps back upon us in its fulness. Our duty to agree with reality is seen to be grounded in a perfectjungle of concrete expediencies.When Berkeley had explained what people meant by matter, people thought that he denied matter's existence. WhenMessrs. Schiller and Dewey now explain what people mean by truth, they are accused of denying its existence. Thesepragmatists destroy all objective standards, critics say, and put foolishness and wisdom on one level. A favoriteformula for describing Mr. Schiller's doctrines and mine is that we are persons who think that by saying whatever youfind it pleasant to say and calling it truth you fulfil every pragmatistic requirement.I leave it to you to judge whether this be not an impudent slander. Pent in, as the pragmatist more than any one elsesees himself to be, between the whole body of funded truths squeezed from the past and the coercions of the world ofsense about him, who so well as he feels the immense pressure of objective control under which our minds performtheir operations?

We have heard much of late of the uses of the imagination in science. It ishigh time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our critics to read anybut the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know inrecent philosophic history. Schiller says the true is that which 'works.' Thereupon he is treated as one who limitsverification to the lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives 'satisfaction.' He is treated as one whobelieves in calling everything true which, if it were true, would be pleasant.Our critics certainly need more imagination of realities. I have honestly tried to stretch my own imagination and toread the best possible meaning into the rationalist conception, but I have to confess that it still completely baffles me.The notion of a reality calling on us to 'agree' with it, and that for no reasons, but simply because its claim is'unconditional' or 'transcendent,' is one that I can make neither head nor tail of. I try to imagine myself as the solereality in the world, and then to imagine what more I would 'claim' if I were allowed to. If you suggest the possibilityof my claiming that a mind should come into being from out of the void inane and stand and copy me, I can indeedimagine what the copying might mean, but I can conjure up no motive. What good it would do me to be copied, orwhat good it would do that mind to copy me, if further consequences are expressly and in principle ruled out asmotives for the claim (as they are by our rationalist authorities) I can not fathom. When the Irishman's admirers ranhim along to the place of banquet in a sedan chair with no bottom, he said, \"Faith, if it wasn't for the honor of thething, I might as well have come on foot.\" So here: but for the honor of the thing, I might as well have remaineduncopied. Copying is one genuine mode of knowing (which for some strange reason our contemporarytranscendentalists seem to be tumbling over each other to repudiate); but when we get beyond copying, and fall backon unnamed forms of agreeing that are expressly denied to be either copyings or leadings or fittings, or any otherprocesses pragmatically definable, the what of the 'agreement' claimed becomes as unintelligible as the why of it.Neither content"},{"pageNumber":625,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP590 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 48]Page 590nor motive can be imagined for it. It is an absolutely meaningless abstraction.1Surely in this field of truth it is the pragmatists and not the rationalists who are the more genuine defenders of theuniverse's rationality.1I am not forgetting that Professor Rickert long ago gave up the whole notion of truth being founded on agreement with reality. Realityaccording to him, is whatever agrees with truth, and truth is founded solely on our primal duty. This fantastic flight, together with Mr.Joachim's candid confession of failure in his book The Nature of Truth, seems to me to mark the bankruptcy of rationalism when dealingwith this subject. Rickert deals with part of the pragmatistic position under the head of what he calls 'Relativismus.' I can not discuss histext here. Suffice it to say that his argumentation in that chapter is so feeble as to seem almost incredible in so generally able a writer."},{"pageNumber":626,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP591 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 49]Page 591Lecture VIIPragmatism and HumanismWhat hardens the heart of every one I approach with the view of truth sketched in my last lecture is that typical idol ofthe tribe, the notion of the Truth, conceived as the one answer, determinate and complete, to the one fixed enigmawhich the world is believed to propound. For popular tradition, it is all the better if the answer be oracular, so as itselfto awaken wonder as an enigma of the second order, veiling rather than revealing what its profundities are supposedto contain. All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter,Nature, Polarity, the Dialectic Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished onthem from this oracular rôle. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queersort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to men consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. The Truth:what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind! I read in an old letter—from a gifted friend who died too young—thesewords: \"In everything, in science, art, morals and religion, there must be one system that is right and every otherwrong.\" How characteristic of the enthusiasm of a certain stage of youth! At twenty-one we rise to such a challengeand expect to find the system. It never occurs to most of us even later that the question 'what is the truth?' is no realquestion (being irrelative to all conditions) and that the whole notion of the truth is an abstraction from the fact oftruths in the plural, a mere useful summarizing phrase like the Latin Language or the Law.Common-law judges sometimes talk about the law, and schoolmasters talk about the latin tongue, in a way to maketheir hearers think they mean entities pre-existent to the decisions or to the words and syntax, determining themunequivocally and requiring them to obey. But the slightest exercise of reflexion makes us see that, instead of beingprinciples of this kind, both law and latin are results.

Truth grafts itself on previous truth, modifying it in the process, just as idiomgrafts itself on previous idiom, and law on previous law. Given previous law and a novel case, and the judge willtwist them into fresh law. Previous idiom; new slang or metaphor or oddity that hits the public taste;—and presto, anew idiom is made. Previous truth; fresh facts:—and our mind finds a new truth.All the while, however, we pretend that the eternal is unrolling, that the one previous justice, grammar or truth issimply fulgurating and not being made. But imagine a youth in the courtroom trying cases with his abstract notion of'the' law, or a censor of speech let loose among the theatres with his idea of 'the' mother-tongue, or a professor settingup to lecture on the actual universe with his rationalistic notion of 'the Truth' with a big T, and what progress do theymake? Truth, law, and language fairly boil away from them at the least touch of novel fact. These things makethemselves as we go. Our rights, wrongs, prohibitions, penalties, words, forms, idioms, beliefs, are so many newcreations that add themselves as fast as history proceeds. Far from being antecedent principles that animate theprocess, law, language, truth are but abstract names for its results.Laws and languages at any rate are thus seen to be manmade things. Mr. Schiller applies the analogy to beliefs, andproposes the name of 'Humanism' for the doctrine that to an unascertainable extent our truths are man-made productstoo. Human motives sharpen all our questions, human satisfactions lurk in all our answers, all our formulas have ahuman twist. This element is so inextricable in the products that Mr. Schiller sometimes seems almost to leave it anopen question whether there be anything else. \"The world,\" he says, \"is essentially , it is what we make it. It isfruitless to define it by what it originally was or by what it is apart from us; it is what is made of it. Hence the worldis plastic.\"1 He adds1Personal Idealism, p. 60."},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP593 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 52]Page 593that we can learn the limits of the plasticity only by trying, and that we ought to start as if it were wholly plastic,acting methodically on that assumption, and stopping only when we are decisively rebuked.This is Mr. Schiller's butt-end-foremost statement of the humanist position, and it has exposed him to severe attack. Imean to defend the humanist position in this lecture, so I will insinuate a few remarks at this point.Mr. Schiller admits as emphatically as any one the presence of resisting factors in every actual experience of truth-making, of which the new-made special truth must take account, and with which it has perforce to 'agree.' All ourtruths are beliefs about 'Reality'; and in any particular belief the reality acts as something independent, as a thingfound, not manufactured. Let me here recall a bit of my last lecture.'Reality' is in general what truths have to take account of;1 and the first part of reality from this point of view is theflux of our sensations. Sensations are forced upon us, coming we know not whence. Over their nature, order andquantity we have as good as no control. They are neither true nor false; they simply are. It is only what we say aboutthem, only the names we give them, our theories of their source and nature and remote relations, that may be true ornot.The second part of reality, as something that our beliefs must also obediently take account of, is the relations thatobtain between our sensations or between their copies in our minds. This part falls into two sub-parts: 1) the relationsthat are mutable and accidental, as those of date and place; and 2) those that are fixed and essential because they aregrounded on the inner natures of their terms—such are likeness and unlikeness. Both sorts of relation are matters ofimmediate perception. Both are 'facts.' But it is the latter kind of fact that forms the more important sub-part of realityfor our theories of knowledge. Inner relations namely are 'eternal,' are perceived whenever their sensible terms arecompared; and of them our thought—mathematical and logical thought so-called—must eternally take account.The third part of reality, additional to these perceptions1 Mr. Taylor in his Elements of Metaphysics uses this excellent pragmatic definition."},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP594 hl[01 03 2011 01 39 58]Page 594(tho largely based upon them), is the previous truths of which every new inquiry takes account. This third part is amuch less obdurately resisting factor: it often ends by giving way. In speaking of these three portions of reality as atall times controlling our belief's formation, I am only reminding you of what we heard in our last hour.Now however fixed these elements of reality may be, we still have a certain freedom in our dealings with them. Takeour sensations. That they are is undoubtedly beyond our control; but which we attend to, note, and make emphatic inour conclusions depends on our own interests; and, according as we lay the emphasis here or there, quite differentformulations of truth result. We read the same facts differently. 'Waterloo,' with the same fixed details, spells a'victory' for an Englishman; for a Frenchman it spells a 'defeat.' So, for an optimist philosopher the universe spellsvictory, for a pessimist, defeat.What we say about reality thus depends on the perspective into which we throw it. The that of it is its own; but thewhat depends on the which; and the which depends on us. Both the sensational and the relational parts of reality aredumb; they say absolutely nothing about themselves. We it is who have to speak for them. This dumbness ofsensations has led such intellectualists as T. H. Green and Edward Caird to shove them almost beyond the pale ofphilosophic recognition, but pragmatists refuse to go so far. A sensation is rather like a client who has given his caseto a lawyer and then has passively to listen in the courtroom to whatever account of his affairs, pleasant or unpleasant,the lawyer finds it most expedient to give.Hence, even in the field of sensation, our minds exert a certain arbitrary choice. By our inclusions and omissions wetrace the field's extent; by our emphasis we mark its foreground and its background; by our order we read it in thisdirection or in that. We receive in short the block of marble, but we carve the statue ourselves.This applies to the 'eternal' parts of reality as well: we shuffle our perceptions of intrinsic relation and arrange themjust as freely. We read them in one serial order or another, class them in this way or in that, treat one or the other asmore"},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP595 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 10]Page 595fundamental, until our beliefs about them form those bodies of truth known as logics, geometrics, or arithmetics, ineach and all of which the form and order in which the whole is cast is flagrantly man-made.Thus, to say nothing of the new facts which men add to the matter of reality by the acts of their own lives, they havealready impressed their mental forms on that whole third of reality which I have called 'previous truths.' Every hourbrings its new percepts, its own facts of sensation and relation, to be truly taken account of; but the whole of our pastdealings with such facts is already funded in the previous truths. It is therefore only the smallest and recentest fractionof the first two parts of reality that comes to us without the human touch, and that fraction has immediately to becomehumanized in the sense of being squared, assimilated, or in some way adapted, to the humanized mass already there.As a matter of fact we can hardly take in an impression at all, in the absence of a preconception of what impressionsthere may possibly be.When we talk of reality 'independent' of human thinking, then, it seems a thing very hard to find. It reduces to thenotion of what is just entering into experience and yet to be named, or else to some imagined aboriginal presence inexperience, before any belief about the presence had arisen, before any human conception had been applied. It is whatis absolutely dumb and evanescent, the merely ideal limit of our minds. We may glimpse it, but we never grasp it;what we grasp is always some substitute for it which previous human thinking has peptonized and cooked for ourconsumption. If so vulgar an expression were allowed us, we might say that wherever we find it, it has been alreadyfaked. This is what Mr. Schiller has in mind when he calls independent reality a mere unresisting , which is onlyto be made over by us.That is Mr. Schiller's belief about the sensible core of reality. We 'encounter' it (in Mr. Bradley's words) but don'tpossess it. Superficially this sounds like Kant's view; but between categories fulminated before nature began, andcategories gradually forming themselves in nature's presence, the whole chasm between rationalism and empiricismyawns. To the"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP596 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 12]Page 596genuine 'Kantianer' Schiller will always be to Kant as a satyr to Hyperion.Other pragmatists may reach more positive beliefs about the sensible core of reality. They may think to get at it in itsindependent nature, by peeling off the successive man-made wrappings. They may make theories that tell us where itcomes from and all about it; and if these theories work satisfactorily they will be true. The transcendental idealists saythere is no core, the finally completed wrapping being reality and truth in one. Scholasticism still teaches that the coreis 'matter.' Professor Bergson, Heymans, Strong, and others believe in the core and bravely try to define it. Messrs.Dewey and Schiller treat it as a 'limit.' Which is the truer of all these diverse accounts, or of others comparable withthem, unless it be the one that finally proves the most satisfactory? On the one hand there will stand reality, on theother an account of it which proves impossible to better or to alter. If the impossibility prove permanent, the truth ofthe account will be absolute. Other content of truth than this I can find no-where. If the anti-pragmatists have anyother meaning, let them for heaven's sake reveal it, let them grant us access to it!Not being reality, but only our belief about reality, it will contain human elements, but these will know the non-humanelement, in the only sense in which there can be knowledge of anything. Does the river make its banks, or do thebanks make the river? Does a man walk with his right leg or with his left leg more essentially? Just as impossiblemay it be to separate the real from the human factors in the growth of our cognitive experience.Let this stand as a first brief indication of the humanistic position. Does it seem paradoxical? If so, I will try to makeit plausible by a few illustrations, which will lead to a fuller acquaintance with the subject.In many familiar objects every one will recognize the human element. We conceive a given reality in this way or inthat, to suit our purpose, and the reality passively submits to the conception. You can take the number 27 as the cubeof 3, or as the product of 3 and 9, or as 26 plus 1, or 100 minus 73, or in countless other ways, of which one will bejust as true"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP597 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 13]Page 597as another. You can take a chess-board as black squares on a white ground, or as white squares on a black ground,and neither conception is a false one.You can treat the adjoined figure as a star, as two big triangles crossing each other, as a hexagon with legs set up onits angles, as six equal triangles hanging together by their tips, etc. All these treatments are true treatments—thesensible that upon the paper resists no one of them. You can say of a line that it runs east, or you can say that it runswest, and the line per se accepts both descriptions without rebelling at the inconsistency.We carve out groups of stars in the heavens, and call them constellations, and the stars patiently suffer us to do so,—though if they knew what we were doing, some of them might feel much surprised at the partners we had given them.We name the same constellation diversely, as Charles's Wain, the Great Bear, or the Dipper. None of the names willbe false, and one will be as true as another, for all are applicable.In all these cases we humanly make an addition to some sensible reality, and that reality tolerates the addition. All theadditions 'agree' with the reality; they fit it, while they build it out. No one of them is false. Which may be treated asthe more true, depends altogether on the human use of it. If the 27 is a number of dollars which I find in a drawerwhere I had left 28, it is 28 minus 1. If it is the number of inches in a shelf which I wish to insert into a cupboard 26inches wide, it is 26 plus 1. If I wish to ennoble the heavens by the constellations I see there, 'Charles's Wain' wouldbe more true than 'Dipper.' My friend Frederick Myers was humorously indignant that that prodigious star-groupshould remind us Americans of nothing but a culinary utensil.What shall we call a thing anyhow? It seems quite arbitrary, for we carve out everything, just as we carve outconstellations, to suit our human purposes. For me, this whole 'audience' is one thing, which grows now restless, nowattentive. I have no use at present for its individual units, so I don't consider them. So of an 'army,' of a 'nation.' But inyour own eyes, ladies and gentlemen, to call you 'audience' is an accidental way of taking you. The permanently realthings for you"},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP598 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 14]Page 598are your individual persons. To an anatomist, again, those persons are but organisms, and the real things are theorgans. Not the organs, so much as their constituent cells, say the histologists; not the cells, but their molecules, say inturn the chemists.We break the flux of sensible reality into things, then, at our will. We create the subjects of our true as well as of ourfalse propositions.We create the predicates also. Many of the predicates of things express only the relations of the things to us and toour feelings. Such predicates of course are human additions. Cæsar crossed the Rubicon, and was a menace to Rome'sfreedom. He is also an American schoolroom pest, made into one by the reaction of our schoolboys on his writings.The added predicate is as true of him as the earlier ones.You see how naturally one comes to the humanistic principle: you can't weed out the human contribution. Our nounsand adjectives are all humanized heirlooms, and in the theories we build them into, the inner order and arrangement iswholly dictated by human considerations, intellectual consistency being one of them. Mathematics and logicthemselves are fermenting with human rearrangements; physics, astronomy and biology follow massive cues ofpreference. We plunge forward into the field of fresh experience with the beliefs our ancestors and we have madealready; these determine what we notice; what we notice determines what we do; what we do again determines whatwe experience; so from one thing to another, altho the stubborn fact remains that there is a sensible flux, what is trueof it seems from first to last to be largely a matter of our own creation.We build the flux out inevitably. The great question is: does it, with our additions, rise or fall in value? Are theadditions worthy or unworthy? Suppose a universe composed of seven stars, and nothing else but three humanwitnesses and their critic. One witness names the stars 'Great Bear'; one calls them 'Charles's Wain'; one calls them the'Dipper.' Which human addition has made the best universe of the given stellar material? If Frederick Myers were thecritic, he would have no hesitation in 'turning down' the American witness."},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP599 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 16]Page 599Lotze has in several places made a deep suggestion. We naïvely assume, he says, a relation between reality and ourminds which may be just the opposite of the true one. Reality, we naturally think, stands ready-made and complete,and our intellects supervene with the one simple duty of describing it as it is already. But may not our descriptions,Lotze asks, be themselves important additions to reality? And may not previous reality itself be there, far less for thepurpose of reappearing unaltered in our knowledge, than for the very purpose of stimulating our minds to suchadditions as shall enhance the universe's total value. 'Die erhöhung des vorgefundenen daseins' is a phrase used byProfessor Eucken some-where, which reminds one of this suggestion by the great Lotze.It is identically our pragmatistic conception. In our cognitive as well as in our active life we are creative. We add,both to the subject and to the predicate part of reality. The world stands really malleable, waiting to receive its finaltouches at our hands. Like the kingdom of heaven, it suffers human violence willingly. Man engenders truths upon it.No one can deny that such a rôle would add both to our dignity and to our responsibility as thinkers. To some of us itproves a most inspiring notion. Signore Papini, the leader of Italian pragmatism, grows fairly dithyrambic over theview that it opens of man's divinely-creative functions.The import of the difference between pragmatism and rationalism is now in sight throughout its whole extent. Theessential contrast is that for rationalism reality is ready-made and complete from all eternity, while for pragmatism itis still in the making, and awaits part of its complexion from the future. On the one side the universe is absolutelysecure, on the other it is still pursuing its adventures.We have got into rather deep water with this humanistic view, and it is no wonder that misunderstanding gathersround it. It is accused of being a doctrine of caprice. Mr. Bradley, for example, says that a humanist, if he understoodhis own doctrine, would have to 'hold any end, however perverted, to be rational, if I insist on it personally, and anyidea, however mad, to be the truth if only some one is resolved that he will have it so.' The humanist view of 'reality,'"},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP600 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 17]Page 600as something resisting, yet malleable, which controls our thinking as an energy that must be taken 'account' ofincessantly (tho not necessarily merely copied) is evidently a difficult one to introduce to novices. The situationreminds me of one that I have personally gone through. I once wrote an essay on our right to believe, which Iunluckily called the Will to Believe. All the critics, neglecting the essay, pounced upon the title. Psychologically it wasimpossible, morally it was iniquitous. The 'will to deceive,' the 'will to make-believe,' were wittily proposed assubstitutes for it.The alternative between pragmatism and rationalism, in the shape in which we now have it before us, is no longer aquestion in the theory of knowledge, it concerns the structure of the universe itself.On the pragmatist side we have only one edition of the universe, unfinished, growing in all sorts of places, especiallyin the places where thinking beings are at work.On the rationalist side we have a universe in many editions, one real one, the infinite folio, or édition de luxe,eternally complete; and then the various finite editions, full of false readings, distorted and mutilated each in its ownway.So the rival metaphysical hypotheses of pluralism and monism here come back upon us. I will develope theirdifferences during the remainder of our hour.And first let me say that it is impossible not to see a temperamental difference at work in the choice of sides. Therationalist mind, radically taken, is of a doctrinaire and authoritative complexion: the phrase 'must be' is ever on itslips. The bellyband of its universe must be tight. A radical pragmatist on the other hand is a happy-go-luckyanarchistic sort of creature. If he had to live in a tub like Diogenes he wouldn't mind at all if the hoops were loose andthe staves let in the sun.Now the idea of this loose universe affects your typical rationalists in much the same way as 'freedom of the press'might affect a veteran official in the Russian bureau of censorship; or as 'simplified spelling' might affect an elderlyschoolmistress. It affects him as the swarm of protestant sects affects a papist onlooker. It appears as backbonelessand devoid of principle as 'opportunism' in politics appears to an"},{"pageNumber":636,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP601 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 19]Page 601old-fashioned French legitimist, or to a fanatical believer in the divine right of the people.For pluralistic pragmatism, truth grows up inside of all the finite experiences. They lean on each other, but the wholeof them, if such a whole there be, leans on nothing. All 'homes' are in finite experience; finite experience as such ishomeless. Nothing outside of the flux secures the issue of it. It can hope salvation only from its own intrinsicpromises and potencies.To rationalists this describes a tramp and vagrant world, adrift in space, with neither elephant nor tortoise to plant thesole of its foot upon. It is a set of stars hurled into heaven without even a centre of gravity to pull against. In otherspheres of life it is true that we have got used to living in a state of relative insecurity. The authority of 'the State,' andthat of an absolute 'moral law,' have resolved themselves into expediencies, and holy church has resolved itself into'meeting-houses.' Not so as yet within the philosophic class-rooms. A universe with such as us contributing to createits truth, a world delivered to our opportunisms and our private judgments! Home-rule for Ireland would be amillennium in comparison. We're no more fit for such a part than the Filipinos are 'fit for self-government.' Such aworld would not be respectable philosophically. It is a trunk without a tag, a dog without a collar, in the eye s ofmost professors of philosophy.What then would tighten this loose universe, according to the professors?Something to support the finite many, to tie it to, to unify and anchor it. Something unexposed to accident, somethingeternal and unalterable. The mutable in experience must be founded on immutability. Behind our de facto world, ourworld in act, there must be a de jure duplicate fixed and previous, with all that can happen here already there in posse,every drop of blood, every smallest item, appointed and provided, stamped and branded, without chance of variation.The negatives that haunt our ideals here below must be themselves negated in the absolutely Real. This alone makesthe universe solid. This is the resting deep. We live upon the stormy surface; but with this our anchor holds, for itgrapples rocky bottom. This is Wordsworth's 'eternal peace abiding at"},{"pageNumber":637,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP602 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 20]Page 602the heart of endless agitation.' This is Vivekananda's mystical One of which I read to you. This is Reality with the bigR, reality that makes the timeless claim, reality to which defeat can't happen. This is what the men of principles, andin general all the men whom I called tender-minded in my first lecture, think themselves obliged to postulate.And this, exactly this, is what the tough-minded of that lecture find themselves moved to call a piece of perverseabstraction-worship. The tough-minded are the men whose alpha and omega are facts. Behind the bare phenomenalfacts, as my tough-minded old friend Chauncey Wright, the great Harvard empiricist of my youth, used to say, there isnothing. When a rationalist insists that behind the facts there is the ground of the facts, the possibility of the facts, thetougher empiricists accuse him of taking the mere name and nature of a fact and clapping it behind the fact as aduplicate entity to make it possible. That such sham grounds are often invoked is notorious. At a surgical operation Iheard a bystander ask a doctor why the patient breathed so deeply. 'Because ether is a respiratory stimulant,' thedoctor answered. 'Ah!' said the questioner, as if relieved by the explanation. But this is like saying that cyanide ofpotassium kills because it is a 'poison,' or that it is so cold to-night because it is 'winter,' or that we have five fingersbecause we are 'pentadactyls.' These are but names for the facts, taken from the facts, and then treated as previous andexplanatory. The tender-minded notion of an absolute reality is, according to the radically tough-minded, framed onjust this pattern. It is but our summarizing name for the whole spread-out and strung-along mass of phenomena,treated as if it were a different entity, both one and previous.You see how differently people take things. The world we live in exists diffused and distributed, in the form of anindefinitely numerous lot of eaches, coherent in all sorts of ways and degrees; and the tough-minded are perfectlywilling to keep them at that valuation. They can stand that kind of world, their temper being well adapted to itsinsecurity. Not so the tender-minded party. They must back the world we find ourselves born into by 'another and abetter' world in which the eaches form an All and the All a One that logically"},{"pageNumber":638,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP603 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 21]Page 603presupposes, co-implicates, and secures each each without exception.Must we as pragmatists be radically tough-minded? or can we treat the absolute edition of the world as a legitimatehypothesis? It is certainly legitimate, for it is thinkable, whether we take it in its abstract or in its concrete shape.By taking it abstractly I mean placing it behind our finite life as we place the word 'winter' behind to-night's coldweather. 'Winter' is only the name for a certain number of days which we find generally characterized by coldweather, but it guarantees nothing in that line, for our thermometer to-morrow may soar into the 70's. Nevertheless theword is a useful one to plunge forward with into the stream of our experience. It cuts off certain probabilities and setsup others. You can put away your straw hats; you can unpack your arctics. It is a summary of things to look for. Itnames a part of nature's habits, and gets you ready for their continuation. It is a definite instrument abstracted fromexperience, a conceptual reality that you must take account of, and which reflects you totally back into sensiblerealities. The pragmatist is the last person to deny the reality of such abstractions. They are so much past experiencefunded.But taking the absolute edition of the world concretely means a different hypothesis. Rationalists take it concretelyand oppose it to the world's finite editions. They give it a particular nature. It is perfect, finished. Everything knownthere is known along with everything else; here, where ignorance reigns, far otherwise. If there is want there, therealso is the satisfaction provided. Here all is process; that world is timeless. Possibilities obtain in our world; in theabsolute world, where all that is not is from eternity impossible, and all that is is necessary, the category of possibilityhas no application. In this world crimes and horrors are regretable. In that totalized world regret obtains not, for 'theexistence of ill in the temporal order is the very condition of the perfection of the eternal order.'Once more, either hypothesis is legitimate in pragmatist eyes, for either has its uses. Abstractly, or taken like the wordwinter, as a memorandum of past experience that orients us towards the future, the notion of the absolute world isindis-"},{"pageNumber":639,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP604 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 23]Page 604pensable. Concretely taken, it is also indispensable, at least to certain minds, for it determines them religiously, beingoften a thing to change their lives by, and by changing their lives, to change whatever in the outer order depends onthem.We can not therefore methodically join the tough minds in their rejection of the whole notion of a world beyond ourfinite experience. One misunderstanding of pragmatism is to identify it with positivistic tough-mindedness, to supposethat it scorns every rationalistic notion as so much jabber and gesticulation, that it loves intellectual anarchy as suchand prefers a sort of wolf-world absolutely unpent and wild and without a master or a collar to any philosophicclassroom product whatsoever. I have said so much in these lectures against the over-tender forms of rationalism, thatI am prepared for some misunderstanding here, but I confess that the amount of it that I have found in this veryaudience surprises me, for I have simultaneously defended rationalistic hypotheses, so far as these re-direct youfruitfully into experience.For instance I receive this morning this question on a postcard: ''Is a pragmatist necessarily a complete materialist andagnostic?\" One of my oldest friends, who ought to know me better, writes me a letter that accuses the pragmatism Iam recommending of shutting out all wider metaphysical views and condemning us to the most terre-á-terrenaturalism. Let me read you some extracts from it.\"It seems to me,\" my friend writes, \"that the pragmatic objection to pragmatism lies in the fact that it might accentuatethe narrowness of narrow minds.\"Your call to the rejection of the namby-pamby and the wishy-washy is of course inspiring. But altho it is salutaryand stimulating to be told that one should be responsible for the immediate issues and bearings of his words andthoughts, I decline to be deprived of the pleasure and profit of dwelling also on remoter bearings and issues, and it isthe tendency of pragmatism to refuse this privilege.\"In short, it seems to me that the limitations, or rather the dangers, of the pragmatic tendency, are analogous to thosewhich beset the unwary followers of the 'natural sciences.' Chemistry and physics are eminently pragmatic; and manyof their devotees, smugly content with the data that their"},{"pageNumber":640,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP605 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 24]Page 605weights and measures furnish, feel an infinite pity and disdain for all students of philosophy and metaphysicswhomsoever. And of course everything can be expressed,—after a fashion, and 'theoretically,'—in terms of chemistryand physics, that is, everything except the vital principle of the whole, and that, they say, there is no pragmatic use intrying to express; it has no bearings—for them. I for my part refuse to be persuaded that we can not look beyond theobvious pluralism of the naturalist and the pragmatist to a logical unity in which they take no interest.\"How is such a conception of the pragmatism I am advocating possible, after my first and second lectures? I have allalong been offering it expressly as a mediator between tough-mindedness and tender-mindedness. If the notion of aworld ante rem, whether taken abstractly like the word winter, or concretely as the hypothesis of an Absolute, can beshown to have any consequences whatever for our life, it has a meaning. If the meaning works, it will have some truththat ought to be held to through all possible reformulations, for pragmatism.The absolutistic hypothesis, that perfection is eternal, ab-original, and most real, has a perfectly definite meaning, andit works religiously. To examine how, will be the subject of my next and final lecture."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP606 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 26]Page 606Lecture VIIIPragmatism and ReligionAt the close of the last lecture I reminded you of the first one, in which I had opposed tough-mindedness to tender-mindedness and recommended pragmatism as their mediator. Tough-mindedness positively rejects tender-mindedness's hypothesis of an eternal perfect edition of the universe coexisting with our finite experience.On pragmatic principles we can not reject any hypothesis if consequences useful to life flow from it. Universalconceptions, as things to take account of, may be as real for pragmatism as particular sensations are. They have,indeed, no meaning and no reality if they have no use. But if they have any use they have that amount of meaning.And the meaning will be true if the use squares well with life's other uses.Well, the use of the Absolute is proved by the whole course of men's religious history. The eternal arms are thenbeneath. Remember Vivekananda's use of the Atman: it is indeed not a scientific use, for we can make no particulardeductions from it. It is emotional and spiritual altogether.It is always best to discuss things by the help of concrete examples. Let me read therefore some of those versesentitled 'To You' by Walt Whitman—'You' of course meaning the reader or hearer of the poem whosoever he or shemay be.Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you that yoube my poem;I whisper with my lips close to your ear,I have loved many women and men, but I love none betterthan you.O I have been dilatory and dumb;I should have made my way to you long ago;I should have blabbed nothing but you, I should havechanted nothing but you.I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you;None have understood you, but I understand you;"},{"pageNumber":642,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP607 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 27]Page 607None have done justice to you—you have not done justiceto yourself;None but have found you imperfect—I only find noimperfection in you.O I could sing such glories and grandeurs about you;You have not known what you are—you have slumberedupon yourself all your life;What you have done returns already in mockeries.But the mockeries are not you;Underneath them and within them, I see you lurk;I pursue you where none else has pursued you.Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, theaccustomed routine, if these conceal you from others, orfrom yourself, they do not conceal you from me;The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, ifthese balk others, they do not balk me;The pert apparel, the deformed attitude, drunkenness, greed,premature death, all these I part aside.There is no endowment in man or woman that is not talliedin you;There is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but asgood is in you;No pluck nor endurance in others, but as good is in you;No pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waitsfor you.Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!These shows of the east and west are tame, compared withyou;These immense meadows—these interminable rivers—youare immense and interminable as they;You are he or she who is master or mistress over them,Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements,pain, passion, dissolution.The hopples fall from your ankles—you find an unfailingsufficiency;Old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by therest, whatever you are promulges itself;"},{"pageNumber":643,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP608 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 33]Page 608Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided,nothing is scanted;Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, whatyou are picks its way.Verily a fine and moving poem, in any case, but there are two ways of taking it, both useful.One is the monistic way, the mystical way of pure cosmic emotion. The glories and grandeurs, they are yoursabsolutely, even in the midst of your defacements. Whatever may happen to you, whatever you may appear to be,inwardly you are safe. Look back, lie back, on your true principle of being! This is the famous way of quietism, ofindifferentism. Its enemies compare it to a spiritual opium. Yet pragmatism must respect this way, for it has massivehistoric vindication.But pragmatism sees another way to be respected also, the pluralistic way of interpreting the poem. The you soglorified, to which the hymn is sung, may mean your better possibilities phenomenally taken, or the specificredemptive effects even of your failures, upon yourself or others. It may mean your loyalty to the possibilities ofothers whom you admire and love so that you are willing to accept your own poor life, for it is that glory's partner.You can at least appreciate, applaud, furnish the audience, of so brave a total world. Forget the low in yourself, then,think only of the high. Identify your life therewith; then, through angers, losses, ignorance, ennui, whatever you thusmake yourself, whatever you thus most deeply are, picks its way.In either way of taking the poem, it encourages fidelity to ourselves. Both ways satisfy; both sanctify the human flux.Both paint the portrait of the you on a gold background. But the background of the first way is the static One, while inthe second way it means possibles in the plural, genuine possibles, and it has all the restlessness of that conception.Noble enough is either way of reading the poem; but plainly the pluralistic way agrees with the pragmatic temper best,for it immediately suggests an infinitely larger number of the details of future experience to our mind. It sets definiteactivities in us at work. Altho this second way seems prosaic and earth-born in comparison with the first way, yet noone"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP609 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 35]Page 609can accuse it of tough-mindedness in any brutal sense of the term. Yet if, as pragmatists, you should positively set upthe second way against the first way, you would very likely be misunderstood. You would be accused of denyingnobler conceptions, and of being an ally of tough-mindedness in the worst sense.You remember the letter from a member of this audience from which I read some extracts at our previous meeting.Let me read you an additional extract now. It shows a vagueness in realizing the alternatives before us which I think isvery widespread.\"I believe,\" writes my friend and correspondent, \"in pluralism; I believe that in our search for truth we leap from onefloating cake of ice to another, on an infinite sea, and that by each of our acts we make new truths possible and oldones impossible; I believe that each man is responsible for making the universe better, and that if he does not do this itwill be in so far left undone.\"Yet at the same time I am willing to endure that my children should be incurably sick and suffering (as they are not)and I myself stupid and yet with brains enough to see my stupidity, only on one condition, namely, that through theconstruction, in imagination and by reasoning, of a rational unity of all things, I can conceive my acts and mythoughts and my troubles as supplemented by all the other phenomena of the world, and as forming—when thussupplemented—a scheme which I approve and adopt as my own; and for my part I refuse to be persuaded that we cannot look beyond the obvious pluralism of the naturalist and pragmatist to a logical unity in which they take no interestor stock.\"Such a fine expression of personal faith warms the heart of the hearer. But how much does it clear his philosophichead? Does the writer consistently favor the monistic, or the pluralistic, interpretation of the world's poem? Histroubles become atoned for when thus supplemented, he says, supplemented, that is, by all the remedies that the otherphenomena may supply. Obviously here the writer faces forward into the particulars of experience, which he interpretsin a pluralistic-melioristic way.But he believes himself to face backward. He speaks of"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP610 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 47]Page 610what he calls the rational unity of things, when all the while he really means their possible empirical unification. Hesupposes at the same time that the pragmatist, because he criticises rationalism's abstract One, is cut off from theconsolation of believing in the saving possibilities of the concrete many. He fails in short to distinguish betweentaking the world's perfection as a necessary principle, and taking it only as a possible terminus ad quem.I regard the writer of the letter as a genuine pragmatist, but as a pragmatist sans le savoir. He appears to me as one ofthat numerous class of philosophic amateurs whom I spoke of in my first lecture, as wishing to have all the goodthings going, without being too careful as to how they agree or disagree. 'Rational unity of all things' is so inspiring aformula, that he brandishes it off-hand, and abstractly accuses pluralism of conflicting with it (for the bare names doconflict), altho concretely he means by it just the pragmatistically unified and ameliorated world. Most of us remain inthis essential vagueness, and it is well that we should; but in the interest of clearheadedness it is well that some of usshould go farther, so I will try now to focus a little more discriminatingly on this particular religious point.Is then this you of yous, this absolutely real world, this unity that yields the moral inspiration and has the religiousvalue, to be taken monistically or pluralistically? Is it ante rem or in rebus? Is it a principle or an end, an absolute oran ultimate, a first or a last? Does it make you look forward or lie back? It is certainly worth while not to clump thetwo things together, for if discriminated, they have decidedly diverse meanings for life.Please observe that the whole dilemma revolves pragmatically about the notion of the world's possibilities.Intellectually, rationalism invokes its absolute principle of unity, as a ground of possibility for the many facts.Emotionally, it sees it as a container and limiter of possibilities, a guarantee that the upshot shall be good. Taken inthis way, the absolute makes all good things certain, and all bad things impossible (in the eternal, namely), and maybe said to transmute the entire category of possibility into categories more secure. One"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP611 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 48]Page 611sees at this point that the great religious difference lies between the men who insist that the world must and shall be,and those who are contented with believing that the world may be, saved. The whole clash of rationalistic andempiricist religion is thus over the validity of possibility. It is necessary therefore to begin by focusing upon that word.What may the word 'possible' definitely mean?To unreflecting men the possible means a sort of third estate of being, less real than existence, more real than non-existence, a twilight realm, a hybrid status, a limbo into which and out of which realities ever and anon are made topass. Such a conception is of course too vague and nondescript to satisfy us. Here, as elsewhere, the only way toextract a term's meaning is to use the pragmatic method on it. When you say a thing is possible, what difference doesit make?It makes at least this difference that if any one calls it impossible you can contradict him, if any one calls it actual youcan contradict him, and if any one calls it necessary you can contradict him too. But these privileges of contradictiondon't amount to much. When you say a thing is possible, does not that make some farther difference in terms of actualfact?It makes at least this negative difference that if the statement be true, it follows that there is nothing extant capable ofpreventing the possible thing. The absence of real grounds of interference may thus be said to make things notimpossible, possible therefore in the bare or abstract sense.But most possibles are not bare, they are concretely grounded, or well-grounded, as we say. What does this meanpragmatically? It means not only that there are no preventive conditions present, but that some of the conditions ofproduction of the possible thing actually are here. Thus a concretely possible chicken means: (1) that the idea ofchicken contains no essential self-contradiction; (2) that no boys, skunks, or other enemies are about; and (3) that atleast an actual egg exists. Possible chicken means actual egg—plus actual sitting hen, or incubator, or what not. Asthe actual conditions approach completeness the chicken becomes a better-and-better-grounded possibility. When theconditions"},{"pageNumber":647,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP612 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 50]Page 612are entirely complete, it ceases to be a possibility, and turns into an actual fact.Let us apply this notion to the salvation of the world. What does it pragmatically mean to say that this is possible? Itmeans that some of the conditions of the world's deliverance do actually exist. The more of them there are existent, thefewer preventing conditions you can find, the better-grounded is the salvation's possibility, the more probable does thefact of the deliverance become.So much for our preliminary look at possibility.Now it would contradict the very spirit of life to say that our minds must be indifferent and neutral in questions likethat of the world's salvation. Any one who pretends to be neutral writes himself down here as a fool and a sham. Weall do wish to minimize the insecurity of the universe; we are and ought to be unhappy when we regard it as exposedto every enemy and open to every life-destroying draft. Nevertheless there are unhappy men who think the salvationof the world impossible. Theirs is the doctrine known as pessimism.Optimism in turn would be the doctrine that thinks the world's salvation inevitable.Midway between the two there stands what may be called the doctrine of meliorism, tho it has hitherto figured less asa doctrine than as an attitude in human affairs. Optimism has always been the regnant doctrine in Europeanphilosophy. Pessimism was only recently introduced by Schopenhauer and counts few systematic defenders as yet.Meliorism treats salvation as neither inevitable nor impossible. It treats it as a possibility, which becomes more andmore of a probability the more numerous the actual conditions of salvation become.It is clear that pragmatism must incline towards meliorism. Some conditions of the world's salvation are actuallyextant, and she can not possibly close her eyes to this fact: and should the residual conditions come, salvation wouldbecome an accomplished reality. Naturally the terms I use here are exceedingly summary. You may interpret the word'salvation' in any way you like, and make it as diffuse and distributive, or as climacteric and integral a phenomenon asyou please.Take, for example, any one of us in this room with the ideals which he cherishes and is willing to live and work for."},{"pageNumber":648,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP613 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 51]Page 613Every such ideal realized will be one moment in the world's salvation. But these particular ideals are not bare abstractpossibilities. They are grounded, they are live possibilities, for we are their live champions and pledges, and if thecomplementary conditions come and add themselves, our ideals will become actual things. What now are thecomplementary conditions? They are first such a mixture of things as will in the fulness of time give us a chance, agap that we can spring into, and, finally, our act.Does our act then create the world's salvation so far as it makes room for itself, so far as it leaps into the gap? Does itcreate, not the whole world's salvation of course, but just so much of this as itself covers of the world's extent?Here I take the bull by the horns, and in spite of the whole crew of rationalists and monists, of whatever brand theybe, I ask why not? Our acts, our turning-places, where we seem to ourselves to make ourselves and grow, are the partsof the world to which we are closest, the parts of which our knowledge is the most intimate and complete. Whyshould we not take them at their face-value? Why may they not be the actual turning-places and growing-placeswhich they seem to be, of the world—why not the workshop of being, where we catch fact in the making, so thatnowhere may the world grow in any other kind of way than this?Irrational! we are told. How can new being come in local spots and patches which add themselves or stay away atrandom, independently of the rest? There must be a reason for our acts, and where in the last resort can any reason belooked for save in the material pressure or the logical compulsion of the total nature of the world? There can be butone real agent of growth, or seeming growth, anywhere, and that agent is the integral world itself. It may grow all-over, if growth there be, but that single parts should grow per se is irrational.But if one talks of rationality—and of reasons for things, and insists that they can't just come in spots, what kind of areason can there ultimately be why anything should come at all? Talk of logic and necessity and categories and theabsolute and the contents of the whole philosophical machine-shop as you will, the only real reason I can think ofwhy anything"},{"pageNumber":649,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP614 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 52]Page 614should ever come is that some one wishes it to be here. It is demanded,— demanded, it may be, to give relief to nomatter how small a fraction of the world's mass. This is living reason, and compared with it material causes andlogical necessities are spectral things.In short the only fully rational world would be the world of wishing-caps, the world of telepathy, where every desireis fulfilled instanter, without having to consider or placate surrounding or intermediate powers. This is the Absolute'sown world. He calls upon the phenomenal world to be, and it is, exactly as he calls for it, no other condition beingrequired. In our world, the wishes of the individual are only one condition. Other individuals are there with otherwishes and they must be propitiated first. So Being grows under all sorts of resistances in this world of the many, and,from compromise to compromise, only gets organized gradually into what may be called secondarily rational shape.We approach the wishing-cap type of organization only in a few departments of life. We want water and we turn afaucet. We want a kodak-picture and we press a button. We want information and we telephone. We want to traveland we buy a ticket. In these and similar cases, we hardly need to do more than the wishing—the world is rationallyorganized to do the rest.But this talk of rationality is a parenthesis and a digression. What we were discussing was the idea of a world growingnot integrally but piecemeal by the contributions of its several parts. Take the hypothesis seriously and as a live one.Suppose that the world's author put the case to you before creation, saying: ''I am going to make a world not certain tobe saved, a world the perfection of which shall be conditional merely, the condition being that each several agent doesits own 'level best.' I offer you the chance of taking part in such a world. Its safety, you see, is unwarranted. It is a realadventure, with real danger, yet it may win through. It is a social scheme of co-operative work genuinely to be done.Will you join the procession? Will you trust yourself and trust the other agents enough to face the risk?\"Should you in all seriousness, if participation in such a world wereproposed to you, feel bound to reject it as not"},{"pageNumber":650,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP615 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 54]Page 615safe enough? Would you say that, rather than be part and parcel of so fundamentally pluralistic and irrational auniverse, you preferred to relapse into the slumber of nonentity from which you had been momentarily aroused by thetempter's voice?Of course if you are normally constituted, you would do nothing of the sort. There is a healthy-minded buoyancy inmost of us which such a universe would exactly fit. We would therefore accept the offer—\"Top! und schlag aufschlag!\" It would be just like the world we practically live in; and loyalty to our old nurse Nature would forbid us tosay no. The world proposed would seem 'rational' to us in the most living way.Most of us, I say, would therefore welcome the proposition and add our fiat to the fiat of the creator. Yet perhapssome would not; for there are morbid minds in every human collection, and to them the prospect of a universe withonly a fighting chance of safety would probably make no appeal. There are moments of discouragement in us all,when we are sick of self and tired of vainly striving. Our own life breaks down, and we fall into the attitude of theprodigal son. We mistrust the chances of things. We want a universe where we can just give up, fall on our father'sneck, and be absorbed into the absolute life as a drop of water melts into the river or the sea.The peace and rest, the security desiderated at such moments is security against the bewildering accidents of so muchfinite experience. Nirvana means safety from this everlasting round of adventures of which the world of senseconsists. The hindoo and the buddhist, for this is essentially their attitude, are simply afraid, afraid of moreexperience, afraid of life.And to men of this complexion, religious monism comes with its consoling words: \"All is needed and essential—evenyou with your sick soul and heart. All are one with God, and with God all is well. The everlasting arms are beneath,whether in the world of finite appearance you seem to fail or to succeed.\" There can be no doubt that when men arereduced to their last sick extremity absolutism is the only saving scheme. Pluralistic moralism simply makes theirteeth chatter, it refrigerates the very heart within their breast."},{"pageNumber":651,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP616 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 55]Page 616So we see concretely two types of religion in sharp contrast. Using our old terms of comparison, we may say that theabsolutistic scheme appeals to the tender-minded while the pluralistic scheme appeals to the tough. Many personswould refuse to call the pluralistic scheme religious at all. They would call it moralistic, and would apply the wordreligious to the monistic scheme alone. Religion in the sense of self-surrender, and moralism in the sense of self-sufficingness, have been pitted against each other as incompatibles frequently enough in the history of human thought.We stand here before the final question of philosophy. I said in my fourth lecture that I believed the monistic-pluralistic alternative to be the deepest and most pregnant question that our minds can frame. Can it be that thedisjunction is a final one? that only one side can be true? Are a pluralism and monism genuine incompatibles? Sothat, if the world were really pluralistically constituted, if it really existed distributively and were made up of a lot ofeaches, it could only be saved piecemeal and de facto as the result of their behavior, and its epic history in no wiseshort-circuited by some essential oneness in which the severalness were already 'taken up' beforehand and eternally'overcome'? If this were so, we should have to choose one philosophy or the other. We could not say 'yes, yes' to bothalternatives. There would have to be a 'no' in our relations with the possible. We should confess an ultimatedisappointment: we could not remain healthy-minded and sick-minded in one indivisible act.Of course as human beings we can be healthy minds on one day and sick souls on the next; and as amateur dabblersin philosophy we may perhaps be allowed to call ourselves monistic pluralists, or free-will determinists, or whateverelse may occur to us of a reconciling kind. But as philosophers aiming at clearness and consistency, and feeling thepragmatistic need of squaring truth with truth, the question is forced upon us of frankly adopting either the tender orthe robustious type of thought. In particular this query has always come home to me: May not the claims of tender-mindedness go too far? May not the notion of a world already saved in toto anyhow, be too saccharine to stand? Maynot religious optimism be too idyllic? Must all be saved? Is no price to be"},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP617 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 56]Page 617paid in the work of salvation? Is the last word sweet? Is all 'yes, yes' in the universe? Does n't the fact of 'no' stand atthe very core of life? Does n't the very 'seriousness' that we attribute to life mean that ineluctable noes and losses forma part of it, that there are genuine sacrifices somewhere, and that something permanently drastic and bitter alwaysremains at the bottom of its cup?I can not speak officially as a pragmatist here; all I can say is that my own pragmatism offers no objection to mytaking sides with this more moralistic view, and giving up the claim of total reconciliation. The possibility of this isinvolved in the pragmatistic willingness to treat pluralism as a serious hypothesis. In the end it is our faith and not ourlogic that decides such questions, and I deny the right of any pretended logic to veto my own faith. I find myselfwilling to take the universe to be really dangerous and adventurous, without therefore backing out and crying 'noplay.' I am willing to think that the prodigal-son attitude, open to us as it is in many vicissitudes, is not the right andfinal attitude towards the whole of life. I am willing that there should be real losses and real losers, and no totalpreservation of all that is. I can believe in the ideal as an ultimate, not as an origin, and as an extract, not the whole.When the cup is poured off, the dregs are left behind for ever, but the possibility of what is poured off is sweetenough to accept.As a matter of fact countless human imaginations live in this moralistic and epic kind of a universe, and find itsdisseminated and strung-along successes sufficient for their rational needs. There is a finely translated epigram in theGreek anthology which admirably expresses this state of mind, this acceptance of loss as unatoned for, even thoughthe lost element might be one's self:\"A shipwrecked sailor, buried on this coast,Bids you set sail.Full many a gallant bark, when we were lost,Weathered the gale.\"Those puritans who answered 'yes' to the question: Are you willing to be damned for God's glory? were in thisobjective and magnanimous condition of mind. The way of escape"},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP618 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 57]Page 618from evil on this system is not by getting it 'aufgehoben,' or preserved in the whole as an element essential but'overcome.' It is by dropping it out altogether, throwing it overboard and getting beyond it, helping to make a universethat shall forget its very place and name.It is then perfectly possible to accept sincerely a drastic kind of a universe from which the element of 'seriousness' isnot to be expelled. Whoso does so is, it seems to me, a genuine pragmatist. He is willing to live on a scheme ofuncertified possibilities which he trusts; willing to pay with his own person, if need be, for the realization of the idealswhich he frames.What now actually are the other forces which he trusts to co-operate with him, in a universe of such a type? They areat least his fellow men, in the stage of being which our actual universe has reached. But are there not superhumanforces also, such as religious men of the pluralistic type we have been considering have always believed in? Theirwords may have sounded monistic when they said \"there is noGod but God\"; but the original polytheism of mankind has only imperfectly and vaguely sublimated itself intomonotheism, and monotheism itself, so far as it was religious and not a scheme of classroom instruction for themetaphysicians, has always viewed God as but one helper, primus inter pares, in the midst of all the shapers of thegreat world's fate.I fear that my previous lectures, confined as they have been to human and humanistic aspects, may have left theimpression on many of you that pragmatism means methodically to leave the superhuman out. I have shown smallrespect indeed for the Absolute, and I have until this moment spoken of no other superhuman hypothesis but that. ButI trust that you see sufficiently that the Absolute has nothing but its super-humanness in common with the theisticGod. On pragmatistic principles, if the hypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it istrue. Now whatever its residual difficulties may be, experience shows that it certainly does work, and that the problemis to build it out and determine it so that it will combine satisfactorily with all the other working truths. I can not startupon a whole theology at the end of this last lecture; but when I tell you that I have written"},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP619 hl[01 03 2011 01 40 59]Page 619a book on men's religious experience, which on the whole has been regarded as making for the reality of God, you willperhaps exempt my own pragmatism from the charge of being an atheistic system. I firmly disbelieve, myself, that ourhuman experience is the highest form of experience extant in the universe. I believe rather that we stand in much thesame relation to the whole of the universe as our canine and feline pets do to the whole of human life. They inhabitour drawing-rooms and libraries. They take part in scenes of whose significance they have no inkling. They aremerely tangent to curves of history the beginnings and ends and forms of which pass wholly beyond their ken. So weare tangent to the wider life of things. But, just as many of the dog's and cat's ideals coincide with our ideals, and thedogs and cats have daily living proof of the fact, so we may well believe, on the proofs that religious experienceaffords, that higher powers exist and are at work to save the world on ideal lines similar to our own.You see that pragmatism can be called religious, if you allow that religion can be pluralistic or merely melioristic intype. But whether you will finally put up with that type of religion or not is a question that only you yourself candecide. Pragmatism has to postpone dogmatic answer, for we do not yet know certainly which type of religion is goingto work best in the long run. The various overbeliefs of men, their several faith-ventures, are in fact what are neededto bring the evidence in. You will probably make your own ventures severally. If radically tough, the hurly-burly ofthe sensible facts of nature will be enough for you, and you will need no religion at all. If radically tender, you willtake up with the more monistic form of religion: the pluralistic form, with its reliance on possibilities that are notnecessities, will not seem to afford you security enough.But if you are neither tough nor tender in an extreme and radical sense, but mixed as most of us are, it may seem toyou that the type of pluralistic and moralistic religion that I have offered is as good a religious synthesis as you arelikely to find. Between the two extremes of crude naturalism on the one hand and transcendental absolutism on theother, you may find that what I take the liberty of calling the pragmatistic or melioristic type of theism is exactly whatyou require."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP621 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 00]Page 621IndexAAbbey, Westminster, 503.ABEL, 579.Absolute, the, 494, 549, 551 f, 605, 614;its barrenness, 518;its value, 519 f, 610;its inacceptability, 521;vs. the 'Ultimate,' 558.Absolute edition of the world, 603 f.Absolute truth, 584.Abstract ideas, their use, 541, 551, 561, 578, 603.Abstractness as a vice in philosophizing, 494, 499, 501, 508, 587, 602.Accountability, 537.Additions, human, to the given, 598.Agreement with reality, 578 f.Ancestral discoveries, 560, 566.Anthology, the Greek, 617.A priori truth, 577.BBaby, 562.BALFOUR, 531 f.Bear, the great, 597 f.Belief, see 'truth.'BERKELEY, 525.BOSANQUET, 493.Boston, 491.BOWNE, 494."},{"pageNumber":656,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP621 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 00]BRADLEY, 499, 548, 595, 599.CCÆSAR, 580, 598.CAIN, 579.CAIRD, 493, 594.Caprice, excluded by pragmatism, 578, 588, 599.Cause, 565.Charles's Wain, 597 f.CHESTERTON, 487.Claim, truth as a, 586 f.Clash of beliefs, 518 f.Classroom philosophy, 495.CLERK-MAXWELL, 572.Climate, 524.Common sense, Lecture V;defined, 560;its 'categories,' 561;a definite stage in evolution;result of successive discoveries, 560, 566.Concepts, their use, 541, 561.Conjunctive relations, 550 f.Constellations, 597 f.Copy-theory of truth, 572, 579, 589.Corridor-theory, 510.Cowpath, 574.Creative functions of human mind, 598 f, 613 f.Cripple Creek, 491.'Critical' level of thought, 567, 569 f.Critical philosophy, 567.Criticisms of pragmatism, 588, 599, 604.D"},{"pageNumber":657,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP621 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 00]Damned, Leibnitz on the, 496.Design in nature, 534-537.Desire creative of reality, 613.DEWEY, 512, 520, 588.Dilemma of philosophy, Lecture I, especially, pp. 492-495.'Dipper,' the, 597 f.Discourse, universe of, 543;its relation to truth, 578 f.Disjunctive relations, 550 f.Dog, mind of, 562.DUHEM, 511.EEmpiricism, 490 f, 508;'radical,' 482.Energy, 570, 580.Escape, philosophies as places of, 501.Eucharist, 524.EUCKEN, 599.Experience, sensible, 561.FFacts, 602;empiricism holds by them, 491;pragmatism loves them, 516;idealism neglects them, 517;their relation to truth, 585.Fallacy, the sentimentalist's, 586.Fitness, 536.Football-game, 491.FRANKLIN, 508.Free-will, problem of, 537 f;a melioristic doctrine, 538."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP621 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 00]FULLERTON, 538.Future, hypothesis of world without, 528 f;of world with, 530.GGeniuses, prehistoric, 566.GOD, 494, 517, 518, 522, 528 f, 531-537, 618;vs. matter as a principle, 530 f;"},{"pageNumber":659,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP622 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 02]Page 622scholastic definition of, 539;supposed choice offered us by, 615.Good, its relation to truth, 520.GREEN, 493, 594.HHAECKEL, 493.Health, 583.History of pragmatism, 506 f.HODGSON, 508.Holidays, moral, 519.Humanism, 515;Lecture VII, especially, 592 f.HUXLEY, 539.IIdeals, as creative, 612 f.Idealism, transcendental, 493;see 'Absolute';Berkeley's, 525.Identity, personal, 525 f.Imputability, 537.Influence, 544 f.Instrumental view of truth, 509, 571.Intellectualism, 490, 573;see 'rationalism.'Intellectualist attacks on pragmatism, 516;view of truth, 573, 581, 585.Interaction of things, 544 f.KKANT, 561."},{"pageNumber":660,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP622 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 02]Kinds, 565.Knower, the absolute, 550, 552, 558.Knowledge, how it grows, 559.LLADD, 494.Law, 'the,' 591;law as a scientific concept, 565.Laws of thought and of nature, 511.Laymen in philosophy, 492.LEIBNITZ, 496 f.LESSING, 582.Letter from member of audience, 604, 609.Levels of thought compared, 568-570.LOCKE, 525.Logic, inductive, 511.Lord's supper, 524.LOTZE, 599.MMACH, 511.MCTAGGART, 538.Many, the One and the, Lecture IV;Manyness co-ordinate with oneness, 546.Materialism defined, 526.Matter, Berkeley on, 525;Spencer on its supposed crassness, 527;vs. God, as a principle, 529-534.Mechanism, 535.Meliorism, 538, 541, 612 f.Merit, 538.Method, the pragmatic, 506, 509.MILHAUD, 511."},{"pageNumber":661,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP622 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 02]Monism, 608;must be absolute, 556 f;religious, 615 f;contrasted with pluralism, 600.

Fortunately, our age seems to be growing philosophical again—still in theashes live the wonted fires. Oxford, long the seed-bed, for the english world, of the idealism inspired by Kant andHegel, has recently become the nursery of a very different way of thinking. Even non-philosophers have begun to takean interest in a controversy over what is known as pluralism or humanism. It looks a little as if the ancient englishempiricism, so long put out of fashion here by nobler sounding germanic formulas, might be re-pluming itself andgetting ready for a stronger flight than ever. It looks as if foundations were being sounded and examined afresh.Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general head. Asthese heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life of philosophy largely consists ofresentments at the classing, and complaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up, and, on thewhole, less acrimony in discussion, for which both Oxford and Harvard are partly to be thanked. As I look back intothe sixties, Mill, Bain, and Hamilton were the only official philosophers in Britain. Spencer, Martineau, and Hodgsonwere just beginning. In France, the pupils of Cousin were delving into history only, and Renouvier alone had anoriginal system. In Germany, the hegelian impetus had spent itself, and, apart from historical scholarship, nothing butthe materialistic controversy remained, with such men as Büchner and Ulrici as its champions. Lotze and Fechnerwere the sole original thinkers, and Fechner was not a professional philosopher at all.The general impression made was of crude issues and oppositions, of small subtlety and of a widely spread ignorance.Amateurishness was rampant. Samuel Bailey's 'letters on the"},{"pageNumber":679,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP632 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 33]Page 632philosophy of the human mind,' published in 1855, are one of the ablest expressions of english associationism, and abook of real power. Yet hear how he writes of Kant: 'No one, after reading the extracts, etc., can be surprised to hearof a declaration by men of eminent abilities, that, after years of study, they had not succeeded in gathering one clearidea from the speculations of Kant. I should have been almost surprised if they had. In or about 1818, Lord Grenville,when visiting the Lakes of England, observed to Professor Wilson that, after five years' study of Kant's philosophy, hehad not gathered from it one clear idea. Wilberforce, about the same time, made the same confession to another friendof my own. ''I am endeavoring,\" exclaims Sir James Mackintosh, in the irritation, evidently, of baffled efforts, \"tounderstand this accursed german philosophy.\"'1What Oxford thinker would dare to print such naïf and provincial-sounding citations of authority to-day?The torch of learning passes from land to land as the spirit bloweth the flame. The deepening of philosophicconsciousness came to us english folk from Germany, as it will probably pass back ere long. Ferrier, J. H. Stirling,and, most of all, T. H. Green are to be thanked. If asked to tell in broad strokes what the main doctrinal change hasbeen, I should call it a change from the crudity of the older english thinking, its ultra-simplicity of mind, both when itwas religious and when it was anti-religious, toward a rationalism derived in the first instance from Germany, butrelieved from german technicality and shrillness, and content to suggest, and to remain vague, and to be, in theenglish fashion, devout.By the time T. H. Green began at Oxford, the generation seemed to feel as if it had fed on the chopped straw ofpsychology and of associationism long enough, and as if a little vastness, even though it went with vagueness, as ofsome moist wind from far away, reminding us of our pre-natal sublimity, would be welcome.Green's great point of attack was the disconnectedness of the reigning english sensationalism. Relating was the greatintellectual activity for him, and the key to this relating was1Bailey: op cit., First Series, p. 52."},{"pageNumber":680,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP633 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 34]Page 633believed by him to lodge itself at last in what most of you know as Kant's unity of apperception, transformed into aliving spirit of the world.Hence a monism of a devout kind. In some way we must be fallen angels, one with intelligence as such; and a greatdisdain for empiricism of the sensationalist sort has always characterized this school of thought, which, on the whole,has reigned supreme at Oxford and in the scottish universities until the present day.But now there are signs of its giving way to a wave of revised empiricism. I confess that I should be glad to see thislatest wave prevail; so—the sooner I am frank about it the better—I hope to have my voice counted in its favor as oneof the results of this lecture-course.What do the terms empiricism and rationalism mean? Reduced to their most pregnant difference, empiricism meansthe habit of explaining wholes by parts, and rationalism means the habit of explaining parts by wholes. Rationalismthus preserves affinities with monism, since wholeness goes with union, while empiricism inclines to pluralistic views.No philosophy can ever be anything but a summary sketch, a picture of the world in abridgment, a foreshortenedbird's-eye view of the perspective of events. And the first thing to notice is this, that the only material we have at ourdisposal for making a picture of the whole world is supplied by the various portions of that world of which we havealready had experience. We can invent no new forms of conception, applicable to the whole exclusively, and notsuggested originally by the parts. All philosophers, accordingly, have conceived of the whole world after the analogyof some particular feature of it which has particularly captivated their attention. Thus, the theists take their cue frommanufacture, the pantheists from growth. For one man, the world is like a thought or a grammatical sentence in whicha thought is expressed. For such a philosopher, the whole must logically be prior to the parts; for letters would neverhave been invented without syllables to spell, or syllables without words to utter.Another man, struck by the disconnectedness and mutual accidentality of so many of the world's details, takes theuniverse as a whole to have been such a disconnectedness"},{"pageNumber":681,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP634 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 35]Page 634originally, and supposes order to have been superinduced upon it in the second instance, possibly by attrition and thegradual wearing away by internal friction of portions that originally interfered.Another will conceive the order as only a statistical appearance, and the universe will be for him like a vast grab-bagwith black and white balls in it, of which we guess the quantities only probably, by the frequency with which weexperience their egress.For another, again, there is no really inherent order, but it is we who project order into the world by selecting objectsand tracing relations so as to gratify our intellectual interests. We carve out order by leaving the disorderly parts out;and the world is conceived thus after the analogy of a forest or a block of marble from which parks or statues may beproduced by eliminating irrelevant trees or chips of stone.Some thinkers follow suggestions from human life, and treat the universe as if it were essentially a place in whichideals are realized. Others are more struck by its lower features, and for them, brute necessities express its characterbetter.All follow one analogy or another; and all the analogies are with some one or other of the universe's subdivisions.Every one is nevertheless prone to claim that his conclusions are the only logical ones, that they are necessities ofuniversal reason, they being all the while, at bottom, accidents more or less of personal vision which had far better beavowed as such; for one man's vision may be much more valuable than another's, and our visions are usually not onlyour most interesting but our most respectable contributions to the world in which we play our part. What was reasongiven to men for, said some eighteenth century writer, except to enable them to find reasons for what they want tothink and do?—and I think the history of philosophy largely bears him out. 'The aim of knowledge,' says Hegel,1 'is todivest the objective world of its strangeness, and to make us more at home in it.' Different men find their minds moreat home in very different fragments of the world.1Smaller Logic, § 194."},{"pageNumber":682,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP635 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 37]Page 635Let me make a few comments, here, on the curious antipathies which these partialities arouse. They are sovereignlyunjust, for all the parties are human beings with the same essential interests, and no one of them is the wholly perversedemon which another often imagines him to be. Both are loyal to the world that bears them; neither wishes to spoil it;neither wishes to regard it as an insane incoherence; both want to keep it as a universe of some kind; and theirdifferences are all secondary to this deep agreement. They may be only propensities to emphasize differently. Or oneman may care for finality and security more than the other. Or their tastes in language may be different. One may likea universe that lends itself to lofty and exalted characterization. To another this may seem sentimental or rhetorical.One may wish for the right to use a clerical vocabulary, another a technical or professorial one. A certain old farmerof my acquaintance in America was called a rascal by one of his neighbors. He immediately smote the man, saying, 'Iwon't stand none of your diminutive epithets.' Empiricist minds, putting the parts before the whole, appear torationalists, who start from the whole, and consequently enjoy magniloquent privileges, to use epithets offensivelydiminutive. But all such differences are minor matters which ought to be subordinated in view of the fact that,whether we be empiricists or rationalists, we are, ourselves, parts of the universe and share the same one deep concernin its destinies. We crave alike to feel more truly at home with it, and to contribute our mite to its amelioration. Itwould be pitiful if small æsthetic discords were to keep honest men asunder.I shall myself have use for the diminutive epithets of empiricism. But if you look behind the words at the spirit, I amsure you will not find it matricidal. I am as good a son as any rationalist among you to our common mother.What troubles me more than this misapprehension is the genuine abstruseness of many of the matters I shall beobliged to talk about, and the difficulty of making them intelligible at one hearing. But there are two pieces, 'zweistücke,' as Kant would have said, in every philosophy—the final outlook, belief, or attitude to which it brings us, andthe reasonings by which that attitude is reached and mediated. A philosophy, as"},{"pageNumber":683,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP636 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 38]Page 636James Ferrier used to tell us, must indeed be true, but that is the least of its requirements. One may be true withoutbeing a philosopher, true by guesswork or by revelation. What distinguishes a philosopher's truth is that it is reasoned.Argument, not supposition, must have put it in his possession. Common men find themselves inheriting their beliefs,they know not how. They jump into them with both feet, and stand there. Philosophers must do more; they must firstget reason's license for them; and to the professional philosophic mind the operation of procuring the license is usuallya thing of much more pith and moment than any particular beliefs to which the license may give the rights of access.Suppose, for example, that a philosopher believes in what is called free-will. That a common man alongside of himshould also share that belief, possessing it by a sort of inborn intuition, does not endear the man to the philosopher atall—he may even be ashamed to be associated with such a man. What interests the philosopher is the particularpremises on which the free-will he believes in is established, the sense in which it is taken, the objections it eludes, thedifficulties it takes account of, in short the whole form and temper and manner and technical apparatus that goes withthe belief in question. A philosopher across the way who should use the same technical apparatus, making the samedistinctions, etc., but drawing opposite conclusions and denying free-will entirely, would fascinate the firstphilosopher far more than would the naïf co-believer. Their common technical interests would unite them more thantheir opposite conclusions separate them. Each would feel an essential consanguinity in the other, would think of him,write at him, care for his good opinion. The simpleminded believer in free-will would be disregarded by either.Neither as ally nor as opponent would his vote be counted.In a measure this is doubtless as it should be, but like all professionalism it can go to abusive extremes. The end isafter all more than the way, in most things human, and forms and methods may easily frustrate their own purpose.The abuse of technicality is seen in the infrequency with which, in philosophical literature, metaphysical questions arediscussed directly and on their own merits. Almost always they are handled as if through a heavy woolen curtain, theveil of"},{"pageNumber":684,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP637 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 44]Page 637previous philosophers' opinions. Alternatives are wrapped in proper names, as if it were indecent for a truth to gonaked. The late Professor John Grote of Cambridge has some good remarks about this. 'Thought,' he says, 'is not aprofessional matter, not something for so-called philosophers only or for professed thinkers. The best philosopher isthe man who can think most simply. I wish that people would consider that thought—and philosophy is no more thangood and methodical thodical thought—is a matter intimate to them, a portion of their real selves that they wouldvalue what they think, and be interested in it. In my own opinion,' he goes on, 'there is something depressing in thisweight of learning, with nothing that can come into one's mind but one is told, Oh, that is the opinion of such and sucha person long ago. I can conceive of nothing more noxious for students than to get into the habit of saying tothemselves about their ordinary philosophic thought, Oh, somebody must have thought it all before.'1 Yet this is thehabit most encouraged at our seats of learning. You must tie your opinion to Aristotle's or Spinoza's; you must defineit by its distance from Kant's; you must refute your rival's view by identifying it with Protagoras's. Thus does allspontaneity of thought, all freshness of conception, get destroyed. Everything you touch is shopworn. The over-technicality and consequent dreariness of the younger disciples at our american universities is appalling. It comes fromtoo much following of german models and manners. Let me fervently express the hope that in this country you willhark back to the more humane english tradition. American students have to regain direct relations with our subject bypainful individual effort in later life. Some of us have done so. Some of the younger ones, I fear, never will, so strongare the professional shop-habits already.In a subject like philosophy it is really fatal to lose connexion with the open air of human nature, and to think in termsof shop-tradition only. In Germany the forms are so professionalized that anybody who has gained a teaching chairand written a book, however distorted and eccentric, has the legal right to figure forever in the history of the subjectlike a fly1Exploratio philosophica, Part I, 1865, pp. xxxviii, 130."},{"pageNumber":685,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP638 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 46]Page 638in amber. All later comers have the duty of quoting him and measuring their opinions with his opinion. Such are therules of the professorial game—they think and write from each other and for each other and at each other exclusively.With this exclusion of the open air all true perspective gets lost, extremes and oddities count as much as sanities, andcommand the same attention; and if by chance any one writes popularly and about results only, with his mind directlyfocussed on the subject, it is reckoned oberflächliches zeug and ganz unwissenschaftlich. Professor Paulsen hasrecently written some feeling lines about this over-professionalism, from the reign of which in Germany his ownwritings, which sin by being 'literary,' have suffered loss of credit. Philosophy, he says, has long assumed in Germanythe character of being an esoteric and occult science. There is a genuine fear of popularity. Simplicity of statement isdeemed synonymous with hollowness and shallowness. He recalls an old professor saying to him once: 'Yes, wephilosophers, whenever we wish, can go so far that in a couple of sentences we can put ourselves where nobody canfollow us.' The professor said this with conscious pride, but he ought to have been ashamed of it. Great as techniqueis, results are greater. To teach philosophy so that the pupils' interest in technique exceeds that in results is surely avicious aberration. It is bad form, not good form, in a discipline of such universal human interest. Moreover,technique for technique, does n't David Hume's technique set, after all, the kind of pattern most difficult to follow? Isn't it the most admirable? The english mind, thank heaven, and the french mind, are still kept, by their aversion tocrude technique and barbarism, closer to truth's natural probabilities. Their literatures show fewer obvious falsities andmonstrosities than that of Germany. Think of the german literature of æsthetics, with the preposterousness of such anunæsthetic personage as Immanuel Kant enthroned in its centre! Think of german books on religions-philosophie,with the heart's battles translated into conceptual jargon and made dialectic. The most persistent setter of questions,feeler of objections, insister on satisfactions, is the religious life. Yet all its troubles can be treated with absurdly littletechnicality. The wonder is that, with their way of working philosophy,"},{"pageNumber":686,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP639 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 47]Page 639individual Germans should preserve any spontaneity of mind at all. That they still manifest freshness and originality inso eminent a degree, proves the indestructible richness of the german cerebral endowment.Let me repeat once more that a man's vision is the great fact about him. Who cares for Carlyle's reasons, orSchopenhauer's, or Spencer's? A philosophy is the expression of a man's intimate character, and all definitions of theuniverse are but the deliberately adopted reactions of human characters upon it. In the recent book from which Iquoted the words of Professor Paulsen, a book of successive chapters by various living german philosophers,1 we passfrom one idiosyncratic personal atmosphere into another almost as if we were turning over a photograph album.If we take the whole history of philosophy, the systems reduce themselves to a few main types which, under all thetechnical verbiage in which the ingenious intellect of man envelops them, are just so many visions, modes of feelingthe whole push, and seeing the whole drift of life, forced on one by one's total character and experience, and on thewhole preferred—there is no other truthful word—as one's best working attitude. Cynical characters take one generalattitude, sympathetic characters another. But no general attitude is possible towards the world as a whole, until theintellect has developed considerable generalizing power and learned to take pleasure in synthetic formulas. Thethought of very primitive men has hardly any tincture of philosophy. Nature can have little unity for savages. It is aWalpurgis-nacht procession, a checkered play of light and shadow, a medley of impish and elfish friendly andinimical powers. 'Close to nature' though they live, they are anything but Wordsworthians. If a bit of cosmic emotionever thrills them, it is likely to be at midnight, when the camp smoke rises straight to the wicked full moon in thezenith, and the forest is all whispering with witchery and danger. The eeriness of the world, the mischief and themanyness, the littleness of the forces, the magical surprises, the unaccountability of every agent, these surely are thecharacters most impressive at that stage of culture, these1Hinneberg: Die Kultur der Gegenwart: Systematische Philosophie. Leipzig: Teubner, 1907."},{"pageNumber":687,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP640 hl[01 03 2011 01 41 59]Page 640communicate the thrills of curiosity and the earliest intellectual stirrings. Tempests and conflagrations, pestilences andearthquakes, reveal supramundane powers, and instigate religious terror rather than philosophy. Nature, more demonicthan divine, is above all things multifarious. So many creatures that feed or threaten, that help or crush, so manybeings to hate or love, to understand or start at—which is on top and which subordinate? Who can tell? They are co-ordinate, rather, and to adapt ourselves to them singly, to 'square' the dangerous powers and keep the others friendly,regardless of consistency or unity, is the chief problem. The symbol of nature at this stage, as Paulsen well says, is thesphinx, under whose nourishing breasts the tearing claws are visible.But in due course of time the intellect awoke, with its passion for generalizing, simplifying, and subordinating, andthen began those divergences of conception which all later experience seems rather to have deepened than to haveeffaced, because objective nature has contributed to both sides impartially, and has let the thinkers emphasize differentparts of her, and pile up opposite imaginary supplements.Perhaps the most interesting opposition is that which results from the clash between what I lately called thesympathetic and the cynical temper. Materialistic and spiritualistic philosophies are the rival types that result: theformer defining the world so as to leave man's soul upon it as a sort of outside passenger or alien, while the latterinsists that the intimate and human must surround and underlie the brutal. This latter is the spiritual way of thinking.Now there are two very distinct types or stages in spiritualistic philosophy, and my next purpose in this lecture is tomake their contrast evident. Both types attain the sought-for intimacy of view, but the one attains it somewhat lesssuccessfully than the other.The generic term spiritualism, which I began by using merely as the opposite of materialism, thus subdivides into twospecies, the more intimate one of which is monistic and the less intimate dualistic. The dualistic species is the theismthat reached its elaboration in the scholastic philosophy, while the monistic species is the pantheism spoken ofsometimes simply as idealism, and sometimes as 'post-kantian' or 'abso-"},{"pageNumber":688,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP641 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 01]Page 641lute' idealism. Dualistic theism is professed as firmly as ever at all catholic seats of learning, whereas it has of lateyears tended to disappear at our british and american universities, and to be replaced by a monistic pantheism more orless open or disguised. I have an impression that ever since T. H. Green's time absolute idealism has been decidedlyin the ascendent at Oxford. It is in the ascendent at my own university of Harvard.Absolute idealism attains, I said, to the more intimate point of view; but the statement needs some explanation. So faras theism represents the world as God's world, and God as what Matthew Arnold called a magnified non-natural man,it would seem as if the inner quality of the world remained human, and as if our relations with it might be intimateenough—for what is best in ourselves appears then also outside of ourselves, and we and the universe are of the samespiritual species. So far, so good, then; and one might consequently ask, What more of intimacy do you require? Towhich the answer is that to be like a thing is not as intimate a relation as to be substantially fused into it, to form onecontinuous soul and body with it; and that pantheistic idealism, making us entitatively one with God, attains thishigher reach of intimacy.The theistic conception, picturing God and his creation as entities distinct from each other, still leaves the humansubject outside of the deepest reality in the universe. God is from eternity complete, it says, and sufficient untohimself; he throws off the world by a free act and as an extraneous substance, and he throws off man as a thirdsubstance, extraneous to both the world and himself. Between them, God says 'one,' the world says 'two,' and mansays 'three,'—that is the orthodox theistic view. And orthodox theism has been so jealous of God's glory that it hastaken pains to exaggerate everything in the notion of him that could make for isolation and separateness. Page uponpage in scholastic books go to prove that God is in no sense implicated by his creative act, or involved in his creation.That his relation to the creatures he has made should make any difference to him, carry any consequence, or qualifyhis being, is repudiated as a pantheistic slur upon his self-sufficingness. I said a moment ago that theism treats us"},{"pageNumber":689,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP642 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 02]Page 642and God as of the same species, but from the orthodox point of view that was a slip of language. God and hiscreatures are toto genere distinct in the scholastic theology, they have absolutely nothing in common; nay, it degradesGod to attribute to him any generic nature whatever; he can be classed with nothing. There is a sense, then, in whichphilosophic theism makes us outsiders and keeps us foreigners in relation to God, in which, at any rate, his connexionwith us appears as unilateral and not reciprocal. His action can affect us, but he can never be affected by our reaction.Our relation, in short, is not a strictly social relation. Of course in common men's religion the relation is believed to besocial, but that is only one of the many differences between religion and theology.This essential dualism of the theistic view has all sorts of collateral consequences. Man being an outsider and a meresubject to God, not his intimate partner, a character of externality invades the field. God is not heart of our heart andreason of our reason, but our magistrate, rather; and mechanically to obey his commands, however strange they maybe, remains our only moral duty. Conceptions of criminal law have in fact played a great part in defining our relationswith him. Our relations with speculative truth show the same externality. One of our duties is to know truth, andrationalist thinkers have always assumed it to be our sovereign duty. But in scholastic theism we find truth alreadyinstituted and established without our help, complete apart from our knowing; and the most we can do is toacknowledge it passively and adhere to it, altho such adhesion as ours can make no jot of difference to what is adheredto. The situation here again is radically dualistic. It is not as if the world came to know itself, or God came to knowhimself, partly through us, as pantheistic idealists have maintained, but truth exists per se and absolutely, by God'sgrace and decree, no matter who of us knows it or is ignorant, and it would continue to exist unaltered, even thoughwe finite knowers were all annihilated.It has to be confessed that this dualism and lack of intimacy has always operated as a drag and handicap on christianthought. Orthodox theology has had to wage a steady fight within the schools against the various forms of pantheistic"},{"pageNumber":690,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP643 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 03]Page 643heresy which the mystical experiences of religious persons, on the one hand, and the formal or æsthetic superioritiesof monism to dualism, on the other, kept producing. God as intimate soul and reason of the universe has alwaysseemed to some people a more worthy conception than God as external creator. So conceived, he appeared to unifythe world more perfectly, he made it less finite and mechanical, and in comparison with such a God an externalcreator seemed more like the product of a childish fancy. I have been told by Hindoos that the great obstacle to thespread of Christianity in their country is the puerility of our dogma of creation. It has not sweep and infinity enoughto meet the requirements of even the illiterate natives of India.Assuredly most members of this audience are ready to side with Hinduism in this matter. Those of us who aresexagenarians have witnessed in our own persons one of those gradual mutations of intellectual climate, due toinnumerable influences, that make the thought of a past generation seem as foreign to its successor as if it were theexpression of a different race of men. The theological machinery that spoke so livingly to our ancestors, with its finiteage of the world, its creation out of nothing, its juridical morality and eschatology, its relish for rewards andpunishments, its treatment of God as an external contriver, an 'intelligent and moral governor,' sounds as odd to mostof us as if it were some outlandish savage religion. The vaster vistas which scientific evolutionism has opened, andthe rising tide of social democratic ideals, have changed the type of our imagination, and the older monarchical theismis obsolete or obsolescent. The place of the divine in the world must be more organic and intimate. An external creatorand his institutions may still be verbally confessed at Church in formulas that linger by their mere inertia, but the lifeis out of them, we avoid dwelling on them, the sincere heart of us is elsewhere.I shall leave cynical materialism entirely out of our discussion as not calling for treatment before this presentaudience, and I shall ignore old-fashioned dualistic theism for the same reason. Our contemporary mind having oncefor all grasped the possibility of a more intimate weltanschauung, the only opinions quite worthy of arresting ourattention will fall"},{"pageNumber":691,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP644 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 05]Page 644within the general scope of what may roughly be called the pantheistic field of vision, the vision of God as theindwelling divine rather than the external creator, and of human life as part and parcel of that deep reality.As we have found that spiritualism in general breaks into a more intimate and a less intimate species, so the moreintimate species itself breaks into two subspecies, of which the one is more monistic, the other more pluralistic inform. I say in form, for our vocabulary gets unmanageable if we don't distinguish between form and substance here.The inner life of things must be substantially akin anyhow to the tenderer parts of man's nature in any spiritualisticphilosophy. The word 'intimacy' probably covers the essential difference. Materialism holds the foreign in things to bemore primary and lasting, it sends us to a lonely corner with our intimacy. The brutal aspects overlap and outwear;refinement has the feebler and more ephemeral hold on reality.From a pragmatic point of view the difference between living against a background of foreignness and one ofintimacy means the difference between a general habit of wariness and one of trust. One might call it a socialdifference, for after all, the common socius of us all is the great universe whose children we are. If materialistic, wemust be suspicious of this socius, cautious, tense, on guard. If spiritualistic, we may give way, embrace, and keep noultimate fear.The contrast is rough enough, and can be cut across by all sorts of other divisions, drawn from other points of viewthan that of foreignness and intimacy. We have so many different businesses with nature that no one of them yields usan all-embracing clasp. The philosophic attempt to define nature so that no one's business is left out, so that no onelies outside the door saying 'Where do I come in?' is sure in advance to fail. The most a philosophy can hope for isnot to lock out any interest forever. No matter what doors it closes, it must leave other doors open for the interestswhich it neglects. I have begun by shutting ourselves up to intimacy and foreignness because that makes so generallyinteresting a contrast, and because it will conveniently introduce a farther contrast to which I wish this hour to lead.The majority of men are sympathetic. Comparatively few"},{"pageNumber":692,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP645 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 06]Page 645are cynics because they like cynicism, and most of our existing materialists are such because they think the evidenceof facts impels them, or because they find the idealists they are in contact with too private and tender-minded; so,rather than join their company, they fly to the opposite extreme. I therefore propose to you to disregard materialistsaltogether for the present, and to consider the sympathetic party alone.It is normal, I say, to be sympathetic in the sense in which I use the term. Not to demand intimate relations with theuniverse, and not to wish them satisfactory, should be accounted signs of something wrong. Accordingly when mindsof this type reach the philosophic level, and seek some unification of their vision, they find themselves compelled tocorrect that aboriginal appearance of things by which savages are not troubled. That sphinx-like presence, with itsbreasts and claws, that first bald multifariousness, is too discrepant an object for philosophic contemplation. Theintimacy and the foreignness cannot be written down as simply coexisting. An order must be made; and in that orderthe higher side of things must dominate. The philosophy of the absolute agrees with the pluralistic philosophy which Iam going to contrast with it in these lectures, in that both identify human substance with the divine substance. Butwhereas absolutism thinks that the said substance becomes fully divine only in the form of totality, and is not its realself in any form but the all-form, the pluralistic view which I prefer to adopt is willing to believe that there mayultimately never be an all-form at all, that the substance of reality may never get totally collected, that some of it mayremain outside of the largest combination of it ever made, and that a distributive form of reality, the each-form, islogically as acceptable and empirically as probable as the all-form commonly acquiesced in as so obviously the self-evident thing. The contrast between these two forms of a reality which we will agree to suppose substantially spiritualis practically the topic of this course of lectures. You see now what I mean by pantheism's two subspecies. If we giveto the monistic subspecies the name of philosophy of the absolute, we may give that of radical empiricism to itspluralistic rival, and it may be well to distinguish them occasionally later by these names."},{"pageNumber":693,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP646 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 07]Page 646As a convenient way of entering into the study of their differences, I may refer to a recent article by Professor Jacksof Manchester College. Professor Jacks, in some brilliant pages in the 'Hibbert Journal' for last October, studies therelation between the universe and the philosopher who describes and defines it for us. You may assume two cases, hesays. Either what the philosopher tells us is extraneous to the universe he is accounting for, an indifferent parasiticoutgrowth, so to speak; or the fact of his philosophizing is itself one of the things taken account of in the philosophy,and self-included in the description. In the former case the philosopher means by the universe everything except whathis own presence brings; in the latter case his philosophy is itself an intimate part of the universe, and may be a partmomentous enough to give a different turn to what the other parts signify. It may be a supreme reaction of theuniverse upon itself by which it rises to self-comprehension. It may handle itself differently in consequence of thisevent.Now both empiricism and absolutism bring the philosopher inside and make man intimate, but the one beingpluralistic and the other monistic, they do so in differing ways that need much explanation. Let me then contrast theone with the other way of representing the status of the human thinker.For monism the world is no collection, but one great all-inclusive fact outside of which is nothing—nothing is its onlyalternative. When the monism is idealistic, this all-enveloping fact is represented as an absolute mind that makes thepartial facts by thinking them, just as we make objects in a dream by dreaming them, or personages in a story byimagining them. To be, on this scheme, is, on the part of a finite thing, to be an object for the absolute; and on the partof the absolute it is to be the thinker of that assemblage of objects. If we use the word 'content' here, we see that theabsolute and the world have an identical content. The absolute is nothing but the knowledge of those objects; theobjects are nothing but what the absolute knows. The world and the all-thinker thus compenetrate and soak each otherup without residuum. They are but two names for the same identical material, considered now from the subjective, andnow from the objective point"},{"pageNumber":694,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP647 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 08]Page 647of view—gedanke and gedachtes, as we would say if we were Germans. We philosophers naturally form part of thematerial, on the monistic scheme. The absolute makes us by thinking us, and if we ourselves are enlightened enoughto be believers in the absolute, one may then say that our philosophizing is one of the ways in which the absolute isconscious of itself. This is the full pantheistic scheme, the identitätsphilosophie, the immanence of God in hiscreation, a conception sublime from its tremendous unity. And yet that unity is incomplete, as closer examination willshow.The absolute and the world are one fact, I said, when materially considered. Our philosophy, for example, is notnumerically distinct from the absolute's own knowledge of itself, not a duplicate and copy of it, it is part of that veryknowledge, is numerically identical with as much of it as our thought covers. The absolute just is our philosophy,along with everything else that is known, in an act of knowing which (to use the words of my gifted absolutistcolleague Royce) forms in its wholeness one luminously transparent conscious moment.But one as we are in this material sense with the absolute substance, that being only the whole of us, and we only theparts of it, yet in a formal sense something like a pluralism breaks out. When we speak of the absolute we take theone universal known material collectively or integrally; when we speak of its objects, of our finite selves, etc., we takethat same identical material distributively and separately. But what is the use of a thing's being only once if it can betaken twice over, and if being taken in different ways makes different things true of it? As the absolute takes me, forexample, I appear with everything else in its field of perfect knowledge. As I take myself, I appear without most otherthings in my field of relative ignorance. And practical differences result from its knowledge and my ignorance.Ignorance breeds mistake, curiosity, misfortune, pain, for me; I suffer those consequences. The absolute knows ofthose things, of course, for it knows me and my suffering, but it does n't itself suffer. It can't be ignorant, forsimultaneous with its knowledge of each question goes its knowledge of each answer. It can't be patient, for it has towait for nothing, having everything at once in its"},{"pageNumber":695,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP648 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 10]Page 648possession. It can't be surprised; it can't be guilty. No attribute connected with succession can be applied to it, for it isall at once and wholly what it is, 'with the unity of a single instant,' and succession is not of it but in it, for we arecontinually told that it is 'timeless.'Things true of the world in its finite aspects, then, are not true of it in its infinite capacity. Quâ finite and plural itsaccounts of itself to itself are different from what its account to itself quâ infinite and one must be.With this radical discrepancy between the absolute and the relative points of view, it seems to me that almost as greata bar to intimacy between the divine and the human breaks out in pantheism as that which we found in monarchicaltheism, and hoped that pantheism might not show. We humans are incurably rooted in the temporal point of view. Theeternal's ways are utterly unlike our ways. 'Let us imitate the All,' said the original prospectus of that admirableChicago quarterly called the 'Monist.' As if we could, either in thought or conduct! We are invincibly parts, let us talkas we will, and must always apprehend the absolute as if it were a foreign being. If what I mean by this is not whollyclear to you at this point, it ought to grow clearer as my lectures proceed."},{"pageNumber":696,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP649 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 11]Page 649Lecture IIMonistic IdealismLet me recall to you the programme which I indicated to you at our last meeting. After agreeing not to considermaterialism in any shape, but to place ourselves straightway upon a more spiritualistic platform, I pointed out threekinds of spiritual philosophy between which we are asked to choose. The first way was that of the older dualistictheism, with ourselves represented as a secondary order of substances created by God. We found that this allowed of adegree of intimacy with the creative principle inferior to that implied in the pantheistic belief that we are substantiallyone with it, and that the divine is therefore the most intimate of all our possessions, heart of our heart, in fact. But wesaw that this pantheistic belief could be held in two forms, a monistic form which I called philosophy of the absolute,and a pluralistic form which I called radical empiricism, the former conceiving that the divine exists authentically onlywhen the world is experienced all at once in its absolute totality, whereas radical empiricism allows that the absolutesum-total of things may never be actually experienced or realized in that shape at all, and that a disseminated,distributed, or incompletely unified appearance is the only form that reality may yet have achieved.I may contrast the monistic and pluralistic forms in question as the 'all-form' and the 'each-form.' At the end of thelast hour I animadverted on the fact that the all-form is so radically different from the each-form, which is our humanform of experiencing the world, that the philosophy of the absolute, so far as insight and understanding go, leaves usalmost as much outside of the divine being as dualistic theism does. I believe that radical empiricism, on the contrary,holding to the each-form, and making of God only one of the eaches, affords the higher degree of intimacy. Thegeneral thesis of these lectures I said would be a defence of the pluralistic against the monistic view. Think of theuniverse as existing solely in the each-form, and you will have on the whole"},{"pageNumber":697,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP650 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 12]Page 650a more reasonable and satisfactory idea of it than if you insist on the all-form being necessary. The rest of my lectureswill do little more than make this thesis more concrete, and I hope more persuasive.It is curious how little countenance radical pluralism has ever had from philosophers. Whether materialistically orspiritualistically minded, philosophers have always aimed at cleaning up the litter with which the world apparently isfilled. They have substituted economical and orderly conceptions for the first sensible tangle; and whether these weremorally elevated or only intellectually neat, they were at any rate always æsthetically pure and definite, and aimed atascribing to the world something clean and intellectual in the way of inner structure. As compared with all theserationalizing pictures, the pluralistic empiricism which I profess offers but a sorry appearance. It is a turbid, muddled,gothic sort of an affair, without a sweeping outline and with little pictorial nobility. Those of you who are accustomedto the classical constructions of reality may be excused if your first reaction upon it be absolute contempt—a shrug ofthe shoulders as if such ideas were unworthy of explicit refutation. But one must have lived some time with a systemto appreciate its merits. Perhaps a little more familiarity may mitigate your first surprise at such a programme as Ioffer.First, one word more than what I said last time about the relative foreignness of the divine principle in the philosophyof the absolute. Those of you who have read the last two chapters of Mr. Bradley's wonderful book, 'Appearance andreality,' will remember what an elaborately foreign aspect his absolute is finally made to assume. It is neitherintelligence nor will, neither a self nor a collection of selves, neither truthful, good, nor beautiful, as we understandthese terms. It is, in short, a metaphysical monster, all that we are permitted to say of it being that whatever it is, it isat any rate worth more (worth more to itself, that is) than if any eulogistic adjectives of ours applied to it. It is us, andall other appearances, but none of us as such, for in it we are all 'transmuted,' and its own as-suchness is of anotherdenomination altogether.Spinoza was the first great absolutist, and the impossibility of being intimate with his God is universally recognized."},{"pageNumber":698,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP651 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 14]Page 651Quatenus infinitus est he is other than what he is quatenus humanam mentem constituit. Spinoza's philosophy hasbeen rightly said to be worked by the word quatenus. Conjunctions, prepositions, and adverbs play indeed the vitalpart in all philosophies; and in contemporary idealism the words 'as' and 'quâ' bear the burden of reconcilingmetaphysical unity with phenomenal diversity. Quâ absolute the world is one and perfect, quâ relative it is many andfaulty, yet it is identically the self-same world—instead of talking of it as many facts, we call it one fact in manyaspects.As absolute, then, or sub specie eternitatis, or quatenus infinitus est, the world repels our sympathy because it has nohistory. As such, the absolute neither acts nor suffers, nor loves nor hates; it has no needs, desires, or aspirations, nofailures or successes, friends or enemies, victories or defeats. All such things pertain to the world quâ relative, inwhich our finite experiences lie, and whose vicissitudes alone have power to arouse our interest. What boots it to tellme that the absolute way is the true way, and to exhort me, as Emerson says, to lift mine eye up to its style, andmanners of the sky, if the feat is impossible by definition? I am finite once for all, and all the categories of mysympathy are knit up with the finite world as such, and with things that have a history. 'Aus dieser erde quellen meinefreuden, und ihre sonne scheinet meinen leiden.' I have neither eyes nor ears nor heart nor mind for anything of anopposite description, and the stagnant felicity of the absolute's own perfection moves me as little as I move it. If wewere readers only of the cosmic novel, things would be different: we should then share the author's point of view andrecognize villains to be as essential as heroes in the plot. But we are not the readers but the very personages of theworld-drama. In your own eyes each of you here is its hero, and the villains are your respective friends or enemies.The tale which the absolute reader finds so perfect, we spoil for one another through our several vital identificationswith the destinies of the particular personages involved.The doctrine on which the absolutists lay most stress is the absolute's 'timeless' character. For pluralists, on the otherhand, time remains as real as anything, and nothing in the universe is great or static or eternal enough not to have"},{"pageNumber":699,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP652 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 20]Page 652some history. But the world that each of us feels most intimately at home with is that of beings with histories that playinto our history, whom we can help in their vicissitudes even as they help us in ours. This satisfaction the absolutedenies us; we can neither help nor hinder it, for it stands outside of history. It surely is a merit in a philosophy to makethe very life we lead seem real and earnest. Pluralism, in exorcising the absolute, exorcises the great de-realizer of theonly life we are at home in, and thus redeems the nature of reality from essential foreignness. Every end, reason,motive, object of desire or aversion, ground of sorrow or joy that we feel is in the world of finite multifariousness, foronly in that world does anything really happen, only there do events come to pass.In one sense this is a far-fetched and rather childish objection, for so much of the history of the finite is as formidablyforeign to us as the static absolute can possibly be—in fact that entity derives its own foreignness largely from thebad character of the finite which it simultaneously is—that this sentimental reason for perferring the pluralistic viewseems small.1 I shall return to the subject in my final lecture, and meanwhile, with your permission, I will say nomore about this objection. The more so as the necessary foreignness of the absolute is cancelled emotionally by itsattribute of totality, which is universally considered to carry the further attribute of perfection in its train. 'Philosophy,'says a recent american philosopher, 'is humanity's hold on totality,' and there is no doubt that most of us find that thebare notion of an absolute all-one is inspiring. 'I yielded myself to the perfect whole,' writes Emerson; and where canyou find a more mind-dilating object? A certain loyalty is called forth by the idea; even if not proved actual, it mustbe believed in somehow. Only an enemy of philosophy can speak lightly of it. Rationalism starts from the idea ofsuch a whole and builds downward. Movement and change are absorbed into its immutability as forms of mereappearance. When you accept this beatific vision of what is, in contrast with what goes on, you1The difference is that the bad parts of this finite are eternal and essential for absolutists, whereas pluralists may hope that they willeventually get sloughed off and become as if they had not been."},{"pageNumber":700,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP653 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 21]Page 653feel as if you had fulfilled an intellectual duty. 'Reality is not in its truest nature a process,' Mr. McTaggart tells us,'but a stable and timeless state.'1 'The true knowledge of God begins,' Hegel writes, 'when we know that things as theyimmediately are have no truth.'2 'The consummation of the infinite aim,' he says elsewhere, 'consists merely inremoving the illusion which makes it seem yet unaccomplished. Good and absolute goodness is eternallyaccomplishing itself in the world: and the result is that it needs not wait upon us, but is already accomplished. It is anillusion under which we live. In the course of its process the Idea makes itself that illusion, by setting an antithesis toconfront it, and its action consists in getting rid of the illusion which it has created.'3But abstract emotional appeals of any kind sound amateurish in the business that concerns us. Impressionisticphilosophizing, like impressionistic watchmaking or land-surveying, is intolerable to experts. Serious discussion of thealternative before us forces me, therefore, to become more technical. The great claim of the philosophy of the absoluteis that the absolute is no hypothesis, but a presupposition implicated in all thinking, and needing only a little effort ofanalysis to be seen as a logical necessity. I will therefore take it in this more rigorous character and see whether itsclaim is in effect so coercive.It has seemed coercive to an enormous number of contemporaneous thinkers. Professor Henry Jones thus describes therange and influence of it upon the social and political life of the present time:4 'For many years adherents of this wayof thought have deeply interested the british public by their writings. Almost more important than their writings is thefact that they have occupied philosophical chairs in almost every university in the kingdom. Even the professionalcritics of idealism are for the most part idealists—after a fashion. And when they are not, they are as a rule moreoccupied with the refutation of idealism than with the construction of a1Quoted by W. Wallace: Lectures and Essays, Oxford, 1898, p. 560.2Logic, tr.

It follows from their position of academic authority, were it from nothing else, that idealism exercises aninfluence not easily measured upon the youth of the nation—upon those, that is, who from the educationalopportunities they enjoy may naturally be expected to become the leaders of the nation's thought and practice. Difficult as it is to measure the forces it is hardly to be denied that the power exercised by Bentham and theutilitarian school has, for better or for worse, passed into the hands of the idealists. ''The Rhine has flowed into theThames\" is the warning note rung out by Mr. Hobhouse. Carlyle introduced it, bringing it as far as Chelsea. ThenJowett and Thomas Hill Green, and William Wallace and Lewis Nettleship, and Arnold Toynbee and David Ritchie—to mention only those teachers whose voices now are silent—guided the waters into those upper reaches known locallyas the Isis. John and Edward Caird brought them up the Clyde, Hutchison Stirling up the Fifth of Forth. They havepassed up the Mersey and up the Severn and Dee and Don. They pollute the bay of St. Andrews and swell the watersof the Cam, and have somehow crept overland into Birmingham. The stream of german idealism has been diffusedover the academical world of Great Britain. The disaster is universal.'Evidently if weight of authority were all, the truth of absolutism would be thus decided. But let us first pass in reviewthe general style of argumentation of that philosophy.As I read it, its favorite way of meeting pluralism and empiricism is by a reductio ad absurdum framed somewhat asfollows: You contend, it says to the pluralist, that things, though in some respects connected, are in other respectsindependent, so that they are not members of one all-inclusive individual fact. Well, your position is absurd on eitherpoint. For admit in fact the slightest modicum of independence, and you find (if you will only think accurately) thatyou have to admit more and more of it, until at last nothing but an absolute chaos, or the proved impossibility of anyconnexion whatever between the parts of the universe, remains upon your hands. Admit, on the other hand, the mostincipient minimum of relation between any two things, and again"},{"pageNumber":702,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP655 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 34]Page 655you can't stop until you see that the absolute unity of all things is implied.If we take the latter reductio ad absurdum first, we find a good example of it in Lotze's well-known proof of monismfrom the fact of interaction between finite things. Suppose, Lotze says in effect, and for simplicity's sake I have toparaphrase him, for his own words are too long to quote—many distinct beings a, b, c, etc., to exist independently ofeach other: can a in that case ever act on b?What is it to act? Is it not to exert an influence? Does the influence detach itself from a and find b? If so, it is a thirdfact, and the problem is not how a acts, but how its 'influence' acts on b. By another influence perhaps? And how inthe end does the chain of influences find b rather than c unless b is somehow prefigured in them already? And whenthey have found b, how do they make b respond, if b has nothing in common with them? Why don't they go rightthrough b? The change in b is a response, due to b's capacity for taking account of a's influence, and that again seemsto prove that b's nature is somehow fitted to a's nature in advance. A and b, in short, are not really as distinct as we atfirst supposed them, not separated by a void. Were this so they would be mutually impenetrable, or at least mutuallyirrelevant. They would form two universes each living by itself, making no difference to each other, taking no accountof each other, much as the universe of your day dreams takes no account of mine. They must therefore belongtogether beforehand, be co-implicated already, their natures must have an inborn mutual reference each to each.Lotze's own solution runs as follows: The multiple independent things supposed cannot be real in that shape, but all ofthem, if reciprocal action is to be possible between them, must be regarded as parts of a single real being, M. Thepluralism with which our view began has to give place to a monism; and the 'transeunt' interaction, beingunintelligible as such, is to be understood as an immanent operation.1The words 'immanent operation' seem here to mean that1Metaphysic, sec. 69 ff."},{"pageNumber":703,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP656 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 36]Page 656the single real being M, of which a and b are members, is the only thing that changes, and that when it changes, itchanges inwardly and all over at once. When part a in it changes, consequently, part b must also change, but withoutthe whole M changing this would not occur.A pretty argument, but a purely verbal one, as I apprehend it. Call your a and b distinct, they can't interact; call themone, they can. For taken abstractly and without qualification the words 'distinct' and 'independent' suggest onlydisconnection. If this be the only property of your a and b (and it is the only property your words imply), then ofcourse, since you can't deduce their mutual influence from it, you can find no ground of its occurring between them.Your bare word 'separate,' contradicting your bare word 'joined,' seems to exclude connexion.Lotze's remedy for the impossibility thus verbally found is to change the first word. If, instead of calling a and bindependent, we now call them 'interdependent,' 'united,' or 'one,' he says, these words do not contradict any sort ofmutual influence that may be proposed. If a and b are 'one,' and the one changes, a and b of course must co-ordinatelychange. What under the old name they could n't do, they now have license to do under the new name.But I ask you whether giving the name of 'one' to the former 'many' makes us really understand the modus operandi ofinteraction any better. We have now given verbal permission to the many to change all together, if they can; we haveremoved a verbal impossibility and substituted a verbal possibility, but the new name, with the possibility it suggests,tells us nothing of the actual process by which real things that are one can and do change at all. In point of factabstract oneness as such does n't change, neither has it parts—any more than abstract independence as such interacts.But then neither abstract oneness nor abstract independence exists; only concrete real things exist, which add to theseproperties the other properties which they possess, to make up what we call their total nature. To construe any one oftheir abstract names as making their total nature impossible is a misuse of the function of naming. The real way ofrescue from the abstract consequences of one name is not to fly to an opposite name,"},{"pageNumber":704,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP657 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 38]Page 657equally abstract, but rather to correct the first name by qualifying adjectives that restore some concreteness to the case.Don't take your 'independence' simpliciter, as Lotze does, take it secundum quid. Only when we know what theprocess of interaction literally and concretely consists in can we tell whether beings independent in definite respects,distinct, for example, in origin, separate in place, different in kind, etc., can or cannot interact.The treating of a name as excluding from the fact named what the name's definition fails positively to include, is whatI call 'vicious intellectualism.' Later I shall have more to say about this intellectualism, but that Lotze's argument istainted by it I hardly think we can deny. As well might you contend (to use an instance from Sigwart) that a personwhom you have once called an 'equestrian' is thereby forever made unable to walk on his own feet.I almost feel as if I should apologize for criticising such subtle arguments in rapid lectures of this kind. The criticismshave to be as abstract as the arguments, and in exposing their unreality, take on such an unreal sound themselves thata hearer not nursed in the intellectualist atmosphere knows not which of them to accuse. But le vin est versé, il faut leboire, and I must cite a couple more instances before I stop.If we are empiricists and go from parts to wholes, we believe that beings may first exist and feed so to speak on theirown existence, and then secondarily become known to one another. But philosophers of the absolute tell us that suchindependence of being from being known would, if once admitted, disintegrate the universe beyond all hope ofmending. The argument is one of Professor Royce's proofs that the only alternative we have is to choose the completedisunion of all things or their complete union in the absolute One.Take, for instance, the proverb 'a cat may look at a king' and adopt the realistic view that the king's being isindependent of the cat's witnessing. This assumption, which amounts to saying that it need make no essentialdifference to the royal object whether the feline subject cognizes him or not, that the cat may look away from him ormay even be annihilated, and the king remain unchanged,—this assumption, I say, is"},{"pageNumber":705,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP658 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 39]Page 658considered by my ingenious colleague to lead to the absurd practical consequence that the two beings can never lateracquire any possible linkages or connexions, but must remain eternally as if in different worlds. For suppose anyconnexion whatever to ensue, this connexion would simply be a third being additional to the cat and the king, whichwould itself have to be linked to both by additional links before it could connect them, and so on ad infinitum, theargument, you see, being the same as Lotze's about how a's influence does its influencing when it influences b.In Royce's own words, if the king can be without the cat knowing him, then king and cat 'can have no commonfeatures, no ties, no true relations; they are separated, each from the other, by absolutely impassable chasms. They cannever come to get either ties or community of nature; they are not in the same space, nor in the same time, nor in thesame natural or spiritual order.'1 They form in short two unrelated universes,—which is the reductio ad absurdumrequired.To escape this preposterous state of things we must accordingly revoke the original hypothesis. The king and the catare not indifferent to each other in the way supposed. But if not in that way, then in no way, for connexion in that waycarries connexion in other ways; so that, pursuing the reverse line of reasoning, we end with the absolute itself as thesmallest fact that can exist. Cat and king are co-involved, they are a single fact in two names, they can never havebeen absent from each other, and they are both equally co-implicated with all the other facts of which the universeconsists.Professor Royce's proof that whoso admits the cat's witnessing the king at all must thereupon admit the integralabsolute, may be briefly put as follows:—First, to know the king, the cat must intend that king, must somehow pass over and lay hold of him individually andspecifically. The cat's idea, in short, must transcend the cat's own separate mind and somehow include the king, forwere the king utterly outside and independent of the cat, the cat's pure other, the beast's mind could touch the king inno wise. This makes the cat much less distinct from the king than we1The World and the Individual, vol. i, pp. 131 132."},{"pageNumber":706,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP659 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 41]Page 659had at first naïvely supposed. There must be some prior continuity between them, which continuity Royce interpretsidealistically as meaning a higher mind that owns them both as objects, and owning them can also own any relation,such as the supposed witnessing, that may obtain between them. Taken purely pluralistically, neither of them can ownany part of a between, because, so taken, each is supposed shut up to itself: the fact of a between thus commits us to ahigher knower.But the higher knower that knows the two beings we start with proves to be the same knower that knows everythingelse. For assume any third being, the queen, say, and as the cat knew the king, so let the king know his queen, and letthis second knowledge, by the same reasoning, require a higher knower as its presupposition. That knower of theking's knowing must, it is now contended, be the same higher knower that was required for the cat's knowing; for ifyou suppose otherwise, you have no longer the same king. This may not seem immediately obvious, but if you followthe intellectualistic logic employed in all these reasonings, I don't see how you can escape the admission. If it be truethat the independent or indifferent cannot be related, for the abstract words 'independent' or 'indifferent' as such implyno relation, then it is just as true that the king known by the cat cannot be the king that knows the queen, for takenmerely 'as such,' the abstract term 'what the cat knows' and the abstract term 'what knows the queen' are logicallydistinct. The king thus logically breaks into two kings, with nothing to connect them, until a higher knower isintroduced to recognize them as the self-same king concerned in any previous acts of knowledge which he may havebrought about. This he can do because he possesses all the terms as his own objects and can treat them as he will. Addany fourth or fifth term, and you get a like result, and so on, until at last an all-owning knower, otherwise called theabsolute, is reached. The co-implicated 'through-and-through' world of monism thus stands proved by irrefutablelogic, and all pluralism appears as absurd.The reasoning is pleasing from its ingenuity, and it is almost a pity that so straight a bridge from abstract logic to"},{"pageNumber":707,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP660 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 42]Page 660concrete fact should not bear our weight. To have the alternative forced upon us of admitting either finite things eachcut off from all relation with its environment, or else of accepting the integral absolute with no environment and allrelations packed within itself, would be too delicious a simplification. But the purely verbal character of the operationis undisguised. Because the names of finite things and their relations are disjoined, it does n't follow that the realitiesnamed need a deus ex machina from on high to conjoin them. The same things disjoined in one respect appear asconjoined in another. Naming the disjunction does n't debar us from also naming the conjunction in a later modifyingstatement, for the two are absolutely co-ordinate elements in the finite tissue of experience. When at Athens it wasfound self-contradictory that a boy could be both tall and short (tall namely in respect of a child, short in respect of aman), the absolute had not yet been thought of, but it might just as well have been invoked by Socrates as by Lotze orRoyce, as a relief from his peculiar intellectualistic difficulty.Everywhere we find rationalists using the same kind of reasoning. The primal whole which is their vision must bethere not only as a fact but as a logical necessity. It must be the minimum that can exist—either that absolute whole isthere, or there is absolutely nothing. The logical proof alleged of the irrationality of supposing otherwise, is that youcan deny the whole only in words that implicitly assert it. If you say 'parts,' of what are they parts? If you call them a'many,' that very word unifies them. If you suppose them unrelated in any particular respect, that 'respect' connectsthem; and so on. In short you fall into hopeless contradiction. You must stay either at one extreme or the other.1'Partly this and partly that,' partly rational, for instance, and partly irrational, is no admissible description of the world.If rationality be in it at all, it must be in it throughout; if irrationality be in it anywhere, that also must pervade itthroughout. It must be wholly1A good illustration of this is to be found in a controversy between Mr. Bradley and the present writer, in Mind for 1893, Mr. Bradleycontending (if I understood him rightly) that 'resemblance' is an illegitimate category, because it admits of degrees, and that the only realrelations in comparison are absolute identity and absolute non-comparability."},{"pageNumber":708,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP661 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 44]Page 661rational or wholly irrational, pure universe or pure multiverse or nulliverse; and reduced to this violent alternative, noone's choice ought long to remain doubtful. The individual absolute, with its parts co-implicated through and through,so that there is nothing in any part by which any other part can remain inwardly unaffected, is the only rationalsupposition. Connexions of an external sort, by which the many became merely continuous instead of beingconsubstantial, would be an irrational supposition.Mr. Bradley is the pattern champion of this philosophy in extremis, as one might call it, for he shows an intoleranceto pluralism so extreme that I fancy few of his readers have been able fully to share it. His reasoning exemplifieseverywhere what I call the vice of intellectualism, for abstract terms are used by him as positively excluding all thattheir definition fails to include. Some Greek sophists could deny that we may say that man is good, for man, they said,means only man, and good means only good, and the word is can't be construed to identify such disparate meanings.Mr. Bradley revels in the same type of argument. No adjective can rationally qualify a substantive, he thinks, for ifdistinct from the substantive, it can't be united with it; and if not distinct, there is only one thing there, and nothing leftto unite. Our whole pluralistic procedure in using subjects and predicates as we do is fundamentally irrational, anexample of the desperation of our finite intellectual estate, infected and undermined as that is by the separatistdiscursive forms which are our only categories, but which absolute reality must somehow absorb into its unity andovercome.Readers of 'Appearance and reality' will remember how Mr. Bradley suffers from a difficulty identical with that towhich Lotze and Royce fall a prey—how shall an influence influence? how shall a relation relate? Any conjunctiverelation between two phenomenal experiences a and b must, in the intellectualist philosophy of these authors, be itselfa third entity; and as such, instead of bridging the one original chasm, it can only create two smaller chasms, each tobe freshly bridged. Instead of hooking a to b, it needs itself to be hooked by a fresh relation r' to a and by another r\"to b. These new relations are but two more entities which them-"},{"pageNumber":709,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP662 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 46]Page 662selves require to be hitched in turn by four still newer relations—so behold the vertiginous regressus ad infinitum infull career.Since a regressus ad infinitum is deemed absurd, the notion that relations come 'between' their terms must be givenup. No mere external go-between can logically connect. What occurs must be more intimate. The hooking must be apenetration, a possession. The relation must involve the terms, each term must involve it, and merging thus their beingin it, they must somehow merge their being in each other, tho, as they seem still phenomenally so separate, we cannever conceive exactly how it is that they are inwardly one. The absolute, however, must be supposed able to performthe unifying feat in his own inscrutable fashion.In old times, whenever a philosopher was assailed for some particularly tough absurdity in his system, he was wont toparry the attack by the argument from the divine omnipotence. 'Do you mean to limit God's power?' he would reply:'do you mean to say that God could not, if he would, do this or that?' This retort was supposed to close the mouths ofall objectors of properly decorous mind. The functions of the bradleian absolute are in this particular identical withthose of the theistic God. Suppositions treated as too absurd to pass muster in the finite world which we inhabit, theabsolute must be able to make good 'somehow' in his ineffable way. First we hear Mr. Bradley convicting things ofabsurdity; next, calling on the absolute to vouch for them quand même. Invoked for no other duty, that duty it mustand shall perform.The strangest discontinuity of our world of appearance with the supposed world of absolute reality is asserted both byBradley and by Royce; and both writers, the latter with great ingenuity, seek to soften the violence of the jolt. But itremains violent all the same, and is felt to be so by most readers. Whoever feels the violence strongly sees as on adiagram in just what the peculiarity of all this philosophy of the absolute consists. First, there is a healthy faith thatthe world must be rational and self-consistent. 'All science, all real knowledge, all experience presuppose,' as Mr.Ritchie writes, 'a coherent universe.' Next, we find a loyal clinging to the"},{"pageNumber":710,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP663 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 47]Page 663rationalist belief that sense-data and their associations are incoherent, and that only in substituting a conceptual orderfor their order can truth be found. Third, the substituted conceptions are treated intellectualistically, that is as mutuallyexclusive and discontinuous, so that the first innocent continuity of the flow of sense-experience is shattered for uswithout any higher conceptual continuity taking its place. Finally, since this broken state of things is intolerable, theabsolute deus ex machina is called on to mend it in his own way, since we cannot mend it in ours.Any other picture than this of post-kantian absolutism I am unable to frame. I see the intellectualistic criticismdestroying the immediately given coherence of the phenomenal world, but unable to make its own conceptualsubstitutes cohere, and I see the resort to the absolute for a coherence of a higher type. The situation has dramaticliveliness, but it is inwardly incoherent throughout, and the question inevitably comes up whether a mistake may notsomewhere have crept in in the process that has brought it about. May not the remedy lie rather in revising theintellectualist criticism than in first adopting it and then trying to undo its consequences by an arbitrary act of faith inan unintelligible agent. May not the flux of sensible experience itself contain a rationality that has been overlooked, sothat the real remedy would consist in harking back to it more intelligently, and not in advancing in the oppositedirection away from it and even away beyond the intellectualist criticism that disintegrates it, to the pseudorationalityof the supposed absolute point of view. I myself believe that this is the real way to keep rationality in the world, andthat the traditional rationalism has always been facing in the wrong direction. I hope in the end to make you share, orat any rate respect, this belief, but there is much to talk of before we get to that point.I employed the word 'violent' just now in describing the dramatic situation in which it pleases the philosophy of theabsolute to make its camp. I don't see how any one can help being struck in absolutist writings by that curioustendency to fly to violent extremes of which I have already said a word. The universe must be rational; well andgood; but how rational? in what sense of that eulogistic but ambiguous"},{"pageNumber":711,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP664 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 49]Page 664word?—this would seem to be the next point to bring up. There are surely degrees in rationality that might bediscriminated and described. Things can be consistent or coherent in very diverse ways. But no more in its conceptionof rationality than in its conception of relations can the monistic mind suffer the notion of more or less. Rationality isone and indivisible: if not rational thus indivisibly, the universe must be completely irrational, and no shadings ormixtures or compromises can obtain. Mr. McTaggart writes, in discussing the notion of a mixture: 'The two principles,of rationality and irrationality, to which the universe is then referred, will have to be absolutely separate andindependent. For if there were any common unity to which they should be referred, it would be that unity and not itstwo manifestations which would be the ultimate explanation and the theory, having thus become monistic,'1 wouldresolve itself into the same alternative once more: is the single principle rational through and through or not?'Can a plurality of reals be possible?' asks Mr. Bradley, and answers, 'No, impossible.' For it would mean a number ofbeings not dependent on each other, and this independence their plurality would contradict. For to be 'many' is to berelated, the word having no meaning unless the units are somehow taken together, and it is impossible to take them ina sort of unreal void, so they must belong to a larger reality, and so carry the essence of the units beyond their properselves, into a whole which possesses unity and is a larger system.2 Either absolute independence or absolute mutualdependence—this, then, is the only alternative allowed by these thinkers. Of course 'independence,' if absolute, wouldbe preposterous, so the only conclusion allowable is that, in Ritchie's words, 'every single event is ultimately related toevery other, and determined by the whole to which it belongs.' The whole complete block-universe through-and-through, therefore, or no universe at all!Professor Taylor is so naïf in this habit of thinking only in extremes that he charges the pluralists with cutting theground from under their own feet in not consistently follow-1Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic, p. 184.2Appearance and Reality, 1893, pp. 141 142."},{"pageNumber":712,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP665 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 55]Page 665ing it themselves. What pluralists say is that a universe really connected loosely, after the pattern of our dailyexperience, is possible, and that for certain reasons it is the hypothesis to be preferred. What Professor Taylor thinksthey naturally must or should say is that any other sort of universe is logically impossible, and that a totality of thingsinterrelated like the world of the monists is not an hypothesis that can be seriously thought out at all.1 Meanwhile nosensible pluralist ever flies or wants to fly to this dogmatic extreme.If chance is spoken of as an ingredient of the universe, absolutists interpret it to mean that double sevens are as likelyto be thrown out of a dice box as double sixes are. If freewill is spoken of, that must mean that an english general isas likely to eat his prisoners to-day as a Maori chief was a hundred years ago. It is as likely—I am using Mr.McTaggart's examples—that a majority of Londoners will burn themselves alive to-morrow as that they will partakeof food, as likely that I shall be hanged for brushing my hair as for committing a murder,2 and so forth, throughvarious suppositions that no indeterminist ever sees real reason to make.This habit of thinking only in the most violent extremes reminds me of what Mr. Wells says of the current objectionsto socialism, in his wonderful little book, 'New worlds for old.' The commonest vice of the human mind is itsdisposition to see everything as yes or no, as black or white, its incapacity for discrimination of intermediate shades.So the critics agree to some hard and fast impossible definition of socialism, and extract absurdities from it as aconjurer gets rabbits from a hat. Socialism abolishes property, abolishes the family, and the rest. The method, Mr.Wells continues, is always the same: It is to assume that whatever the socialist postulates as desirable is wantedwithout limit of qualification,—for socialist read pluralist and the parallel holds good,—it is to imagine that whateverproposal is made by him is to be carried out by uncontrolled monomaniacs, and so to make a picture of the socialistdream which can be presented to the simple-minded person in doubt—'This is socialism'—1Cf. Elements of Metaphysics, p. 88.2Some Dogmas of Religion, p. 184."},{"pageNumber":713,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP666 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 57]Page 666or pluralism, as the case may be. 'Surely!—SURELY! you don't want this!'How often have I been replied to, when expressing doubts of the logical necessity of the absolute, of flying to theopposite extreme: 'But surely, SURELY there must be some connexion among things!' As if I must necessarily be anuncontrolled monomanic insanely denying any connexion whatever. The whole question revolves in very truth aboutthe word 'some.' Radical empiricism and pluralism stand out for the legitimacy of the notion of some: each part of theworld is in some ways connected, in some other ways not connected with its other parts, and the ways can bediscriminated, for many of them are obvious, and their differences are obvious to view. Absolutism, on its side, seemsto hold that 'some' is a category ruinously infected with self-contradictoriness, and that the only categories inwardlyconsistent and therefore pertinent to reality are 'all' and 'none.'The question runs into the still more general one with which Mr. Bradley and later writers of the monistic school havemade us abundantly familiar—the question, namely, whether all the relations with other things, possible to a being,are pre-included in its intrinsic nature and enter into its essence, or whether, in respect to some of these relations, itcan be without reference to them, and, if it ever does enter into them, do so adventitiously and as it were by an after-thought. This is the great question as to whether 'external' relations can exist. They seem to, undoubtedly. Mymanuscript, for example, is 'on' the desk. The relation of being 'on' does n't seem to implicate or involve in any waythe inner meaning of the manuscript or the inner structure of the desk—these objects engage in it only by theiroutsides, it seems only a temporary accident in their respective histories. Moreover, the 'on' fails to appear to oursenses as one of those unintelligible 'betweens' that have to be separately hooked on the terms they pretend to connect.All this innocent sense-appearance, however, we are told, cannot pass muster in the eyes of reason. It is a tissue ofself-contradiction which only the complete absorption of the desk and the manuscript into the higher unity of a moreabsolute reality can overcome."},{"pageNumber":714,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP667 hl[01 03 2011 01 42 58]Page 667The reasoning by which this conclusion is supported is too subtle and complicated to be properly dealt with in apublic lecture, and you will thank me for not inviting you to consider it at all.1 I feel the more free to pass it by now asI think that the cursory account of the absolutistic attitude which I have already given is sufficient for our presentpurpose, and that my own verdict on the philosophy of the absolute as 'not proven'—please observe that I go nofarther now—need not be backed by argument at every special point. Flanking operations are less costly and in someways more effective than frontal attacks. Possibly you will yourselves think after hearing my remaining lectures thatthe alternative of an universe absolutely rational or absolutely irrational is forced and strained, and that a via mediaexists which some of you may agree with me is to be preferred. Some rationality certainly does characterize ouruniverse; and, weighting one kind with another, we may deem that the incomplete kinds that appear are on the wholeas acceptable as the through-and-through sort of rationality on which the monistic systematizers insist.All the said systematizers who have written since Hegel have owed their inspiration largely to him. Even when theyhave found no use for his particular triadic dialectic, they have drawn confidence and courage from his authoritativeand conquering tone. I have said nothing about Hegel in this lecture, so I must repair the omission in the next.1 For a more detailed criticism of Mr. Bradley's intellectualism, see Appendix A."},{"pageNumber":715,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP668 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 10]Page 668Lecture IIIHegel and his MethodDirectly or indirectly, that strange and powerful genius Hegel has done more to strengthen idealistic pantheism inthoughtful circles than all other influences put together. I must talk a little about him before drawing my finalconclusions about the cogency of the arguments for the absolute. In no philosophy is the fact that a philosopher'svision and the technique he uses in proof of it are two different things more palpably evident than in Hegel. Thevision in his case was that of a world in which reason holds all things in solution and accounts for all the irrationalitythat superficially appears by taking it up as a 'moment' into itself. This vision was so intense in Hegel, and the tone ofauthority with which he spoke from out of the midst of it was so weighty, that the impression he made has never beeneffaced. Once dilated to the scale of the master's eye, the disciples' sight could not contract to any lesser prospect. Thetechnique which Hegel used to prove his vision was the so-called dialectic method, but here his fortune has been quitecontrary. Hardly a recent disciple has felt his particular applications of the method to be satisfactory. Many have letthem drop entirely, treating them rather as a sort of provisional stop-gap, symbolic of what might some day provepossible of execution, but having no literal cogency or value now. Yet these very same disciples hold to the visionitself as a revelation that can never pass away. The case is curious and worthy of our study.It is still more curious in that these same disciples, altho they are usually willing to abandon any particular instance ofthe dialectic method to its critics, are unshakably sure that in some shape the dialectic method is the key to truth.What, then, is the dialectic method? It is itself a part of the hegelian vision or intuition, and a part that finds thestrongest echo in empiricism and common sense. Great injustice is done to Hegel by treating him as primarily areasoner. He is in reality a naïvely observant man, only beset with a perverse preference"},{"pageNumber":716,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP669 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 11]Page 669for the use of technical and logical jargon. He plants himself in the empirical flux of things and gets the impression ofwhat happens. His mind is in very truth impressionistic; and his thought, when once you put yourself at the animatingcentre of it, is the easiest thing in the world to catch the pulse of and to follow.Any author is easy if you can catch the centre of his vision. From the centre in Hegel come those towering sentencesof his that are comparable only to Luther's, as where, speaking of the ontological proof of God's existence from theconcept of him as the ens perfectissimum to which no attribute can be lacking, he says: 'It would be strange if theNotion, the very heart of the mind, or, in a word, the concrete totality we call God, were not rich enough to embraceso poor a category as Being, the very poorest and most abstract of all—for nothing can be more insignificant thanBeing.' But if Hegel's central thought is easy to catch, his abominable habits of speech make his application of it todetails exceedingly difficult to follow. His passion for the slipshod in the way of sentences, his unprincipled playingfast and loose with terms; his dreadful vocabulary, calling what completes a thing its 'negation,' for example; hissystematic refusal to let you know whether he is talking logic or physics or psychology, his whole deliberately adoptedpolicy of ambiguity and vagueness, in short: all these things make his present-day readers wish to tear their hair—orhis—out in desperation. Like Byron's corsair, he has left a name 'to other times, linked with one virtue and a thousandcrimes.'The virtue was the vision, which was really in two parts. The first part was that reason is all-inclusive, the second wasthat things are 'dialectic.' Let me say a word about this second part of Hegel's vision.The impression that any naïf person gets who plants himself innocently in the flux of things is that things are off theirbalance. Whatever equilibriums our finite experiences attain to are but provisional. Martinique volcanoes shatter ourwordsworthian equilibrium with nature. Accidents, either moral, mental, or physical, break up the slowly built-upequilibriums men reach in family life and in their civic and professional relations. Intellectual enigmas frustrate ourscientific"},{"pageNumber":717,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP670 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 13]Page 670systems, and the ultimate cruelty of the universe upsets our religious attitudes and outlooks. Of no special system ofgood attained does the universe recognize the value as sacred. Down it tumbles, over it goes, to feed the ravenousappetite for destruction, of the larger system of history in which it stood for a moment as a landing-place andstepping-stone. This dogging of everything by its negative, its fate, its undoing, this perpetual moving on to somethingfuture which shall supersede the present, this is the hegelian intuition of the essential provisionality, and consequentunreality, of everything empirical and finite. Take any concrete finite thing and try to hold it fast. You cannot, for soheld, it proves not to be concrete at all, but an arbitrary extract or abstract which you have made from the remainderof empirical reality. The rest of things invades and overflows both it and you together, and defeats your rash attempt.Any partial view whatever of the world tears the part out of its relations, leaves out some truth concerning it, is untrueof it, falsifies it. The full truth about anything involves more than that thing. In the end nothing less than the whole ofeverything can be the truth of anything at all.Taken so far, and taken in the rough, Hegel is not only harmless, but accurate. There is a dialectic movement inthings, if such it please you to call it, one that the whole constitution of concrete life establishes; but it is one that canbe described and accounted for in terms of the pluralistic vision of things far more naturally than in the monistic termsto which Hegel finally reduced it. Pluralistic empiricism knows that everything is in an environment, a surroundingworld of other things, and that if you leave it to work there it will inevitably meet with friction and opposition from itsneighbors. Its rivals and enemies will destroy it unless it can buy them off by compromising some part of its originalpretensions.But Hegel saw this undeniable characteristic of the world we live in in a non-empirical light. Let the mental idea ofthe thing work in your thought all alone, he fancied, and just the same consequences will follow. It will be negated bythe opposite ideas that dog it, and can survive only by entering, along with them, into some kind of treaty. This treatywill be"},{"pageNumber":718,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP671 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 14]Page 671an instance of the so-called 'higher synthesis' of everything with its negative; and Hegel's originality lay intransporting the process from the sphere of percepts to that of concepts and treating it as the universal method bywhich every kind of life, logical, physical, or psychological, is mediated. Not to the sensible facts as such, then, didHegel point for the secret of what keeps existence going, but rather to the conceptual way of treating them. Conceptswere not in his eyes the static self-contained things that previous logicians had supposed, but were germinative, andpassed beyond themselves into each other by what he called their immanent dialectic. In ignoring each other as theydo, they virtually exclude and deny each other, he thought, and thus in a manner introduce each other. So the dialecticlogic, according to him, had to supersede the 'logic of identity' in which, since Aristotle, all Europe had been broughtup.This view of concepts is Hegel's revolutionary performance; but so studiously vague and ambiguous are all hisexpressions of it that one can hardly tell whether it is the concepts as such, or the sensible experiences and elementsconceived, that Hegel really means to work with. The only thing that is certain is that whatever you may say of hisprocedure, some one will accuse you of misunderstanding it. I make no claim to understanding it, I treat it merelyimpressionistically.So treating it, I regret that he should have called it by the name of logic. Clinging as he did to the vision of a reallyliving world, and refusing to be content with a chopped-up intellectualist picture of it, it is a pity that he should haveadopted the very word that intellectualism had already preempted. But he clung fast to the old rationalist contempt forthe immediately given world of sense and all its squalid particulars, and never tolerated the notion that the form ofphilosophy might be empirical only. His own system had to be a product of eternal reason, so the word 'logic,' with itssuggestions of coercive necessity, was the only word he could find natural. He pretended therefore to be using the apriori method, and to be working by a scanty equipment of ancient logical terms—position, negation, reflection,universal, particular, individual, and the like. But what he really worked by was his own empirical perceptions, whichexceeded and"},{"pageNumber":719,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP672 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 15]Page 672overflowed his miserably insufficient logical categories in every instance of their use.What he did with the category of negation was his most original stroke. The orthodox opinion is that you can advancelogically through the field of concepts only by going from the same to the same. Hegel felt deeply the sterility of thislaw of conceptual thought; he saw that in a fashion negation also relates things; and he had the brilliant idea oftranscending the ordinary logic by treating advance from the different to the different as if it were also a necessity ofthought. 'The so-called maxim of identity,' he wrote, 'is supposed to be accepted by the consciousness of every one.But the language which such a law demands, ''a planet is a planet, magnetism is magnetism, mind is mind,\" deservesto be called silliness. No mind either speaks or thinks or forms conceptions in accordance with this law, and noexistence of any kind whatever conforms to it. We must never view identity as abstract identity, to the exclusion of alldifference. That is the touchstone for distinguishing all bad philosophy from what alone deserves the name ofphilosophy. If thinking were no more than registering abstract identities, it would be a most superfluous performance.Things and concepts are identical with themselves only in so far as at the same time they involve distinction.'1The distinction that Hegel has in mind here is naturally in the first instance distinction from all other things orconcepts. But in his hands this quickly develops into contradiction of them, and finally, reflected back upon itself, intoself-contradiction; and the immanent self-contradictoriness of all finite concepts thenceforth becomes the propulsivelogical force that moves the world.2 'Isolate a thing from all its relations,' says Dr. Edward Caird,3 expounding Hegel,'and try to assert it by itself; you find that it has negated itself as well as its relations. The thing in itself is nothing.' Or,to quote Hegel's own words: 'When we suppose an existent A, and another, B, B is at first defined as the other. But Ais just as much1Hegel, Smaller Logic, pp. 184 185.2Cf. Hegel's fine vindication of this function of contradiction in his Wissenschaft der Logik, Bk. ii, sec. 1, chap. ii, C, Anmerkung 3.3Hegel, in Blackwood's Philosophical Classics, p. 162."},{"pageNumber":720,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP673 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 17]Page 673the other of B. Both are others in the same fashion. \"Other\" is the other by itself, therefore the other of every other,consequently the other of itself, the simply unlike itself, the self-negator, the self-alterer,' etc.1 Hegel writes elsewhere:'The finite, as implicitly other than what it is, is forced to surrender its own immediate or natural being, and to turnsuddenly into its opposite. Dialectic is the universal and irresistible power before which nothing can stay. Summumjus, summa injuria—to drive an abstract right to excess is to commit injustice. Extreme anarchy and extremedespotism lead to one another. Pride comes before a fall. Too much with outwits itself. Joy brings tears, melancholy asardonic smile.'2 To which one well might add that most human institutions, by the purely technical and professionalmanner in which they come to be administered, end by becoming obstacles to the very purposes which their foundershad in view.Once catch well the knack of this scheme of thought and you are lucky if you ever get away from it. It is all you cansee. Let any one pronounce anything, and your feeling of a contradiction being implied becomes a habit, almost amotor habit in some persons who symbolize by a stereotyped gesture the position, sublation, and final reinstatementinvolved. If you say 'two' or 'many,' your speech bewrayeth you, for the very name collects them into one. If youexpress doubt, your expression contradicts its content, for the doubt itself is not doubted but affirmed. If you say'disorder,' what is that but a certain bad kind of order? if you say 'indetermination,' you are determining just that. Ifyou say 'nothing but the unexpected happens,' the unexpected becomes what you expected. If you say 'all things arerelative,' to what is the all of them itself relative? If you say 'no more,' you have said more already, by implying aregion in which no more is found; to know a limit as such is consequently already to have got beyond it; and so forth,throughout as many examples as one cares to cite.Whatever you posit appears thus as one-sided, and negates its other, which, being equally one-sided, negates it; and,since this situation remains unstable, the two contradictory1Wissenschaft der Logik, Bk. i, sec. 1, chap. ii, B, a.2Wallace's translation of the Smaller Logic, p. 128."},{"pageNumber":721,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP674 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 18]Page 674terms have together, according to Hegel, to engender a higher truth of which they both appear as indispensablemembers, mutually mediating aspects of that higher concept or situation in thought.Every higher total, however provisional and relative, thus reconciles the contradictions which its parts, abstracted fromit, prove implicitly to contain. Rationalism, you remember, is what I called the way of thinking that methodicallysubordinates parts to wholes, so Hegel here is rationalistic through and through. The only whole by which allcontradictions are reconciled is for him the absolute whole of wholes, the all-inclusive reason to which Hegel himselfgave the name of the absolute Idea, but which I shall continue to call 'the absolute' purely and simply, as I have donehitherto.Empirical instances of the way in which higher unities reconcile contradictions are innumerable, so here again Hegel'svision, taken merely impressionistically, agrees with countless facts. Somehow life does, out of its total resources, findways of satisfying opposites at once. This is precisely the paradoxical aspect which much of our civilization presents.Peace we secure by armaments, liberty by laws and constitutions; simplicity and naturalness are the consummate resultof artificial breeding and training; health, strength, and wealth are increased only by lavish use, expense, and wear.Our mistrust of mistrust engenders our commercial system of credit; our tolerance of anarchistic and revolutionaryutterances is the only way of lessening their danger; our charity has to say no to beggars in order not to defeat its owndesires; the true epicurean has to observe great sobriety; the way to certainty lies through radical doubt; virtue signifiesnot innocence but the knowledge of sin and its overcoming; by obeying nature, we command her, etc. The ethical andthe religious life are full of such contradictions held in solution. You hate your enemy?—well, forgive him, andthereby heap coals of fire on his head; to realize yourself, renounce yourself; to save your soul, first lose it; in short,die to live.From such massive examples one easily generalizes Hegel's vision. Roughly, his 'dialectic' picture is a fair account ofa good deal of the world. It sounds paradoxical, but whenever you once place yourself at the point of view of anyhigher"},{"pageNumber":722,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP675 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 20]Page 675synthesis, you see exactly how it does in a fashion take up opposites into itself. As an example, consider the conflictbetween our carnivorous appetites and hunting instincts and the sympathy with animals which our refinement isbringing in its train. We have found how to reconcile these opposites most effectively by establishing game-laws andclose seasons and by keeping domestic herds. The creatures preserved thus are preserved for the sake of slaughter,truly, but if not preserved for that reason, not one of them would be alive at all. Their will to live and our will to killthem thus harmoniously combine in this peculiar higher synthesis of domestication.Merely as a reporter of certain empirical aspects of the actual, Hegel, then, is great and true. But he aimed at beingsomething far greater than an empirical reporter, so I must say something about that essential aspect of his thought.Hegel was dominated by the notion of a truth that should prove incontrovertible, binding on every one, and certain,which should be the truth, one, indivisible, eternal, objective, and necessary, to which all our particular thinking mustlead as to its consummation. This is the dogmatic ideal, the postulate, uncriticised, undoubted, and unchallenged, ofall rationalizers in philosophy. 'I have never doubted,' a recent Oxford writer says, that truth is universal and singleand timeless, a single content or significance, one and whole and complete.1 Advance in thinking, in the hegelianuniverse, has, in short, to proceed by the apodictic words must be rather than by those inferior hypothetic words maybe, which are all that empiricists can use.Now Hegel found that his idea of an immanent movement through the field of concepts by way of 'dialectic' negationplayed most beautifully into the hands of this rationalistic demand for something absolute and inconcussum in the wayof truth. It is easy to see how. If you affirm anything, for example that A is, and simply leave the matter thus, youleave it at the mercy of any one who may supervene and say 'not A, but B is.' If he does say so, your statement doesn't refute1 Joachim, The Nature of Truth, Oxford, 1906, pp. 22, 178. The argument in case the belief should be doubted would be the highersynthetic idea: if two truths were possible, the duality of that possibility would itself be the one truth that would unite them."},{"pageNumber":723,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP676 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 21]Page 676him, it simply contradicts him, just as his contradicts you. The only way of making your affirmation about A self-securing is by getting it into a form which will by implication negate all possible negations in advance. The mereabsence of negation is not enough; it must be present, but present with its fangs drawn. What you posit as A mustalready have cancelled the alternative or made it innocuous, by having negated it in advance. Double negation is theonly form of affirmation that fully plays into the hands of the dogmatic ideal. Simply and innocently affirmativestatements are good enough for empiricists, but unfit for rationalist use, lying open as they do to every accidentalcontradictor, and exposed to every puff of doubt. The final truth must be something to which there is no imaginablealternative, because it contains all its possible alternatives inside of itself as moments already taken account of andovercome. Whatever involves its own alternatives as elements of itself is, in a phrase often repeated, its 'own other,'made so by the methode der absoluten negativität.Formally, this scheme of an organism of truth that has already fed as it were on its own liability to death, so that,death once dead for it, there's no more dying then, is the very fulfilment of the rationalistic aspiration. That one andonly whole, with all its parts involved in it, negating and making one another impossible if abstracted and takensingly, but necessitating and holding one another in place if the whole of them be taken integrally, is the literal idealsought after; it is the very diagram and picture of that notion of the truth with no outlying alternative, to which nothingcan be added, nor from it anything withdrawn, and all variations from which are absurd, which so dominates thehuman imagination. Once we have taken in the features of this diagram that so successfully solves the world-oldproblem, the older ways of proving the necessity of judgments cease to give us satisfaction. Hegel's way we thinkmust be the right way. The true must be essentially the self-reflecting self-contained recurrent, that which securesitself by including its own other and negating it; that makes a spherical system with no loose ends hanging out forforeignness to get a hold upon; that is forever rounded in and closed, not strung along rectilinearly and open at itsends like that universe of simply collective or additive form which"},{"pageNumber":724,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP677 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 23]Page 677Hegel calls the world of the bad infinite, and which is all that empiricism, starting with simply posited single partsand elements, is ever able to attain to.No one can possibly deny the sublimity of this hegelian conception. It is surely in the grand style, if there be such athing as a grand style in philosophy. For us, however, it remains, so far, a merely formal and diagrammaticconception; for with the actual content of absolute truth, as Hegel materially tries to set it forth, few disciples havebeen satisfied, and I do not propose to refer at all to the concreter parts of his philosophy. The main thing now is tograsp the generalized vision, and feel the authority of the abstract scheme of a statement self-secured by involvingdouble negation. Absolutists who make no use of Hegel's own technique are really working by his method. Youremember the proofs of the absolute which I instanced in my last lecture, Lotze's and Royce's proofs by reductio adabsurdum, to the effect that any smallest connexion rashly supposed in things will logically work out into absoluteunion, and any minimal disconnexion into absolute disunion,—these are really arguments framed on the hegelianpattern. The truth is that which you implicitly affirm in the very attempt to deny it; it is that from which everyvariation refutes itself by proving self-contradictory. This is the supreme insight of rationalism, and to-day the bestmust-be's of rationalist argumentation are but so many attempts to communicate it to the hearer.Thus, you see, my last lecture and this lecture make connexion again and we can consider Hegel and the otherabsolutists to be supporting the same system. The next point I wish to dwell on is the part played by what I havecalled vicious intellectualism in this wonderful system's structure.Rationalism in general thinks it gets the fulness of truth by turning away from sensation to conception, conceptionobviously giving the more universal and immutable picture. Intellectualism in the vicious sense I have already definedas the habit of assuming that a concept excludes from any reality conceived by its means everything not included inthe concept's definition. I called such intellectualism illegitimate as I found it used in Lotze's, Royce's, and Bradley'sproofs of the absolute (which absolute I consequently held to be non-"},{"pageNumber":725,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP678 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 24]Page 678proven by their arguments), and I left off by asserting my own belief that a pluralistic and incompletely integrateduniverse, describable only by the free use of the word 'some,' is a legitimate hypothesis.Now Hegel himself, in building up his method of double negation, offers the vividest possible example of this vice ofintellectualism. Every idea of a finite thing is of course a concept of that thing and not a concept of anything else. ButHegel treats this not being a concept of anything else as if it were equivalent to the concept of anything else not being,or in other words as if it were a denial or negation of everything else. Then, as the other things, thus implicitlycontradicted by the thing first conceived, also by the same law contradict it, the pulse of dialectic commences to beatand the famous triads begin to grind out the cosmos. If any one finds the process here to be a luminous one, he mustbe left to the illumination, he must remain an undisturbed hegelian. What others feel as the intolerable ambiguity,verbosity, and unscrupulousness of the master's way of deducing things, he will probably ascribe—since divineoracles are notoriously hard to interpret—to the 'difficulty' that habitually accompanies profundity. For my own part,there seems something grotesque and saugrenu in the pretension of a style so disobedient to the first rules of soundcommunication between minds, to be the authentic mother-tongue of reason, and to keep step more accurately thanany other style does with the absolute's own ways of thinking. I do not therefore take Hegel's technical apparatusseriously at all. I regard him rather as one of those numerous original seers who can never learn how to articulate. Hiswould-be coercive logic counts for nothing in my eyes; but that does not in the least impugn the philosophicimportance of his conception of the absolute, if we take it merely hypothetically as one of the great types of cosmicvision.Taken thus hypothetically, I wish to discuss it briefly. But before doing so I must call your attention to an oddpeculiarity in the hegelian procedure. The peculiarity is one which will come before us again for a final judgment inmy seventh lecture, so at present I only note it in passing. Hegel, you remember, considers that the immediate finitedata of expe-"},{"pageNumber":726,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP679 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 31]Page 679rience are 'untrue' because they are not their own others. They are negated by what is external to them. The absolute istrue because it and it only has no external environment, and has attained to being its own other. (These words soundqueer enough, but those of you who know something of Hegel's text will follow them.) Granting his premise that to betrue a thing must in some sort be its own other, everything hinges on whether he is right in holding that the severalpieces of finite experience themselves cannot be said to be in any wise their own others. When conceptually orintellectualistically treated, they of course cannot be their own others. Every abstract concept as such excludes what itdoes n't include, and if such concepts are adequate substitutes for reality's concrete pulses, the latter must squarethemselves with intellectualistic logic, and no one of them in any sense can claim to be its own other. If, however, theconceptual treatment of the flow of reality should prove for any good reason to be inadequate and to have a practicalrather than a theoretical or speculative value, then an independent empirical look into the constitution of reality'spulses might possibly show that some of them are their own others, and indeed are so in the self-same sense in whichthe absolute is maintained to be so by Hegel. When we come to my sixth lecture, on Professor Bergson, I shall ineffect defend this very view, strengthening my thesis by his authority. I am unwilling to say anything more about thepoint at this time, and what I have just said of it is only a sort of surveyor's note of where our present position lies inthe general framework of these lectures.Let us turn now at last to the great question of fact, Does the absolute exist or not? to which all our previousdiscussion has been preliminary. I may sum up that discussion by saying that whether there really be an absolute ornot, no one makes himself absurd or self-contradictory by doubting or denying it. The charges of self-contradiction,where they do not rest on purely verbal reasoning, rest on a vicious intellectualism. I will not recapitulate mycriticisms. I will simply ask you to change the venue, and to discuss the absolute now as if it were only an openhypothesis. As such, is it more probable or more improbable?But first of all I must parenthetically ask you to distinguish"},{"pageNumber":727,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP680 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 32]Page 680the notion of the absolute carefully from that of another object with which it is liable to become heedlessly entangled.That other object is the 'God' of common people in their religion, and the creator-God of orthodox christian theology.Only thoroughgoing monists or pantheists believe in the absolute. The God of our popular Christianity is but onemember of a pluralistic system. He and we stand outside of each other, just as the devil, the saints, and the angelsstand outside of both of us. I can hardly conceive of anything more different from the absolute than the God, say, ofDavid or of Isaiah. That God is an essentially finite being in the cosmos, not with the cosmos in him, and indeed hehas a very local habitation there, and very one-sided local and personal attachments. If it should prove probable thatthe absolute does not exist, it will not follow in the slightest degree that a God like that of David, Isaiah, or Jesus maynot exist, or may not be the most important existence in the universe for us to acknowledge. I pray you, then, not toconfound the two ideas as you listen to the criticisms I shall have to proffer. I hold to the finite God, for reasonswhich I shall touch on in the seventh of these lectures; but I hold that his rival and competitor—I feel almost temptedto say his enemy—the absolute, is not only not forced on us by logic, but that it is an improbable hypothesis.The great claim made for the absolute is that by supposing it we make the world appear more rational. Any hypothesisthat does that will always be accepted as more probably true than an hypothesis that makes the world appear irrational.Men are once for all so made that they prefer a rational world to believe in and to live in. But rationality has at leastfour dimensions, intellectual, æsthetical, moral, and practical; and to find a world rational to the maximal degree in allthese respects simultaneously is no easy matter. Intellectually, the world of mechanical materialism is the mostrational, for we subject its events to mathematical calculation. But the mechanical world is ugly, as arithmetic is ugly,and it is nonmoral. Morally, the theistic world is rational enough, but full of intellectual frustrations. The practicalworld of affairs, in its turn, so supremely rational to the politician, the military man, or the man of conqueringbusiness-faculty that he never"},{"pageNumber":728,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP681 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 34]Page 681would vote to change the type of it, is irrational to moral and artistic temperaments; so that whatever demand forrationality we find satisfied by a philosophic hypothesis, we are liable to find some other demand for rationalityunsatisfied by the same hypothesis. The rationality we gain in one coin we thus pay for in another; and the problemaccordingly seems at first sight to resolve itself into that of getting a conception which will yield the largest balanceof rationality rather than one which will yield perfect rationality of every description. In general, it may be said that ifa man's conception of the world lets loose any action in him that is easy, or any faculty which he is fond ofexercising, he will deem it rational in so far forth, be the faculty that of computing, fighting, lecturing, classifying,framing schematic tabulations, getting the better end of a bargain, patiently waiting and enduring, preaching, joke-making, or what you like. Albeit the absolute is defined as being necessarily an embodiment of objectively perfectrationality, it is fair to its english advocates to say that those who have espoused the hypothesis most concretely andseriously have usually avowed the irrationality to their own minds of certain elements in it.Probably the weightiest contribution to our feeling of the rationality of the universe which the notion of the absolutebrings is the assurance that however disturbed the surface may be, at bottom all is well with the cosmos—centralpeace abiding at the heart of endless agitation. This conception is rational in many ways, beautiful æsthetically,beautiful intellectually (could we only follow it into detail), and beautiful morally, if the enjoyment of security can beaccounted moral. Practically it is less beautiful; for, as we saw in our last lecture, in representing the deepest reality ofthe world as static and without a history, it loosens the world's hold upon our sympathies and leaves the soul of itforeign. Nevertheless it does give peace, and that kind of rationality is so paramountly demanded by men that to theend of time there will be absolutists, men who choose belief in a static eternal, rather than admit that the finite worldof change and striving, even with a God as one of the strivers, is itself eternal. For such minds Professor Royce'swords will always be the truest: 'The very presence of ill in the temporal order is the condition of the"},{"pageNumber":729,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP682 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 46]Page 682perfection of the eternal order. We long for the absolute only in so far as in us the absolute also longs, and seeksthrough our very temporal striving, the peace that is nowhere in time, but only, and yet absolutely, in eternity. Werethere no longing in time there would be no peace in eternity. God [i. e. the absolute] who here in me aims at what Inow temporally miss, not only possesses in the eternal world the goal after which I strive, but comes to possess iteven through and because of my sorrow. Through this my tribulation the absolute triumph then is won. In theabsolute I am fulfilled. Yet my very fulfillment demands and therefore can transcend this sorrow.'1 Royce isparticularly felicitous in his ability to cite parts of finite experience to which he finds his picture of this absoluteexperience analogous. But it is hard to portray the absolute at all without rising into what might be called the 'inspired'style of language—I use the word not ironically, but prosaically and descriptively, to designate the only literary formthat goes with the kind of emotion that the absolute arouses. One can follow the pathway of reasoning soberlyenough,2 but the picture itself has to be effulgent. This admirable faculty of transcending, whilst inwardly preserving,every contrariety, is the absolute's characteristic form of rationality. We are but syllables in the mouth of the Lord; ifthe whole sentence is divine, each syllable is absolutely what it should be, in spite of all appearances. In making upthe balance for or against absolutism, this emotional value weights heavily the credit side of the account.The trouble is that we are able to see so little into the positive detail of it, and that if once admitted not to becoercively proven by the intellectualist arguments, it remains only a hypothetic possibility.On the debit side of the account the absolute, taken seriously, and not as a mere name for our right occasionally todrop the strenuous mood and take a moral holiday, introduces all those tremendous irrationalities into the universewhich a frankly pluralistic theism escapes, but which have1The World and the Individual, vol. ii, pp. 385, 386, 409.2The best uninspired argument (again not ironical!) which I know is that in Miss M. W. Calkins's excellent book, The Persistent Problems ofPhilosophy, Macmillan, 1902."},{"pageNumber":730,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP683 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 47]Page 683been flung as a reproach at every form of monistic theism or pantheism. It introduces a speculative 'problem of evil'namely, and leaves us wondering why the perfection of the absolute should require just such particular hideous formsof life as darken the day for our human imaginations. If they were forced on it by something alien, and to 'overcome'them the absolute had still to keep hold of them, we could understand its feeling of triumph, though we, so far as wewere ourselves among the elements overcome, could acquiesce but sullenly in the resultant situation, and would neverjust have chosen it as the most rational one conceivable. But the absolute is represented as a being withoutenvironment, upon which nothing alien can be forced, and which has spontaneously chosen from within to give itselfthe spectacle of all that evil rather than a spectacle with less evil in it.1 Its perfection is represented as the source ofthings, and yet the first effect of that perfection is the tremendous imperfection of all finite experience. In whateversense the word 'rationality' may be taken, it is vain to contend that the impression made on our finite minds by such away of representing things is altogether rational. Theologians have felt its irrationality acutely, and the 'fall,' thepredestination, and the election which the situation involves have given them more trouble than anything else in theirattempt to pantheize Christianity. The whole business remains a puzzle, both intellectually and morally.Grant that the spectacle or world-romance offered to itself by the absolute is in the absolute's eyes perfect. Why wouldnot the world be more perfect by having the affair remain in just those terms, and by not having any finite spectatorsto come in and add to what was perfect already their innumerable imperfect manners of seeing the same spectacle?Suppose the entire universe to consist of one superb copy of a book, fit for the ideal reader. Is that universe improvedor deteriorated by having myriads of garbled and misprinted separate leaves and chapters also publisht, giving falseimpressions of the book to whoever looks at them? To say the least, the balance of rationality is not obviously in favorof such added1 Cf. Dr. Fuller's excellent article, 'Ethical monism and the problem of evil,' in the Harvard Journal of Theology, vol. i, No. 2, April,1908."},{"pageNumber":731,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP684 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 49]Page 684mutilations. So this question becomes urgent: Why, the absolute's own total vision of things being so rational, was itnecessary to comminute it into all these coexisting inferior fragmentary visions?Leibnitz in his theodicy represents God as limited by an antecedent reason in things which makes certaincombinations logically incompatible, certain goods impossible. He surveys in advance all the universes he mightcreate, and by an act of what Leibnitz calls his antecedent will he chooses our actual world as the one in which theevil, unhappily necessary anyhow, is at its minimum. It is the best of all the worlds that are possible, therefore, but byno means the most abstractly desirable world. Having made this mental choice, God next proceeds to what Leibnitzcalls his act of consequent or decretory will: he says 'Fiat' and the world selected springs into objective being, with allthe finite creatures in it to suffer from its imperfections without sharing in its creator's atoning vision.Lotze has made some penetrating remarks on this conception of Leibnitz's, and they exactly fall in with what I say ofthe absolutist conception. The world projected out of the creative mind by the fiat, and existing in detachment from itsauthor, is a sphere of being where the parts realize themselves only singly. If the divine value of them is evident onlywhen they are collectively looked at, then, Lotze rightly says, the world surely becomes poorer and not richer forGod's utterance of the fiat. He might much better have remained contented with his merely antecedent choice of thescheme, without following it up by a creative decree. The scheme as such was admirable; it could only lose by beingtranslated into reality.1 Why, I similarly ask, should the absolute ever have lapsed from the perfection of its ownintegral experience of things, and refracted itself into all our finite experiences?It is but fair to recent english absolutists to say that many of them have confessed the imperfect rationality of theabsolute from this point of view. Mr. McTaggart, for example, writes: 'Does not our very failure to perceive theperfection of the universe destroy it? In so far as we do not see the1Metaphysic, sec. 79."},{"pageNumber":732,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP685 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 51]Page 685perfection of the universe, we are not perfect ourselves. And as we are parts of the universe, that cannot be perfect.'1And Mr. Joachim finds just the same difficulty. Calling the hypothesis of the absolute by the name of the 'coherencetheory of truth,' he calls the problem of understanding how the complete coherence of all things in the absolute shouldinvolve as a necessary moment in its self-maintenance the self-assertion of the finite minds, a self-assertion which inits extreme form is error,—he calls this problem, I say, an insoluble puzzle. If truth be the universal fons et origo,how does error slip in? 'The coherence theory of truth,' he concludes, 'may thus be said to suffer shipwreck at the veryentrance of the harbor.'2 Yet in spite of this rather bad form of irrationality, Mr. Joachim stoutly asserts his 'immediatecertainty'3 of the theory shipwrecked, the correctness of which he says he has 'never doubted.' This candid confessionof a fixed attitude of faith in the absolute, which even one's own criticisms and perplexities fail to disturb, seems tome very significant. Not only empiricists, but absolutists also, would all, if they were as candid as this author, confessthat the prime thing in their philosophy is their vision of a truth possible, which they then employ their reasoning toconvert, as best it can, into a certainty or probability.I can imagine a believer in the absolute retorting at this point that he at any rate is not dealing with mere probabilities,but that the nature of things logically requires the multitudinous erroneous copies, and that therefore the universecannot be the absolute's book alone. For, he will ask, is not the absolute defined as the total consciousness ofeverything that is? Must not its field of view consist of parts? And what can the parts of a total consciousness beunless they be fractional consciousnesses? Our finite minds must therefore co-exist with the absolute mind. We are itsconstituents, and it cannot live without us.—But if any one of you feels tempted to retort in this wise, let me remindyou that you are frankly employing pluralistic weapons, and thereby giving up the absolutist cause. The notion that theabsolute is made of1Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic, secs. 150, 153.2The Nature of Truth, 1906, pp. 170 171.3Ibid., p. 179."},{"pageNumber":733,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP686 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 52]Page 686constituents on which its being depends is the rankest empiricism. The absolute as such has objects, not constituents,and if the objects develop selfhoods upon their own several accounts, those selfhoods must be set down as factsadditional to the absolute consciousness, and not as elements implicated in its definition. The absolute is a rationalistconception. Rationalism goes from wholes to parts, and always assumes wholes to be self-sufficing.1My conclusion, so far, then, is this, that altho the hypothesis of the absolute, in yielding a certain kind of religiouspeace, performs a most important rationalizing function, it nevertheless, from the intellectual point of view, remainsdecidedly irrational. The ideally perfect whole is certainly that whole of which the parts also are perfect—if we candepend on logic for anything, we can depend on it for that definition. The absolute is defined as the ideally perfectwhole, yet most of its parts, if not all, are admittedly imperfect. Evidently the conception lacks internal consistency,and yields us a problem rather than a solution. It creates a speculative puzzle, the so-called mystery of evil and oferror, from which a pluralistic metaphysic is entirely free.In any pluralistic metaphysic, the problems that evil presents are practical, not speculative. Not why evil should existat all, but how we can lessen the actual amount of it, is the sole question we need there consider. 'God,' in the religiouslife of ordinary men, is the name not of the whole of things, heaven forbid, but only of the ideal tendency in things,believed in as a superhuman person who calls us to co-operate in his purposes, and who furthers ours if they areworthy. He works in an external environment, has limits, and has enemies. When John Mill said that the notion ofGod's omnipotence must be given up, if God is to be kept as a religious object, he was surely accurately right; yet soprevalent is the lazy monism that idly haunts the region of God's name, that so simple and truthful a saying wasgenerally treated as a1The psychological analogy that certain finite tracts of consciousness are composed of isolable parts added together, cannot be used byabsolutists as proof that such parts are essential elements of all consciousness. Other finite fields of consciousness seem in point of factnot to be similarly resolvable into isolable parts."},{"pageNumber":734,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP687 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 54]Page 687paradox: God, it was said, could not be finite. I believe that the only God worthy of the name must be finite, and Ishall return to this point in a later lecture. If the absolute exist in addition—and the hypothesis must, in spite of itsirrational features, still be left open—then the absolute is only the wider cosmic whole of which our God is but themost ideal portion, and which in the more usual human sense is hardly to be termed a religious hypothesis at all.'Cosmic emotion' is the better name for the reaction it may awaken.Observe that all the irrationalities and puzzles which the absolute gives rise to, and from which the finite God remainsfree, are due to the fact that the absolute has nothing, absolutely nothing, outside of itself. The finite God whom Icontrast with it may conceivably have almost nothing outside of himself; he may already have triumphed over andabsorbed all but the minutest fraction of the universe; but that fraction, however small, reduces him to the status of arelative being, and in principle the universe is saved from all the irrationalities incidental to absolutism. The onlyirrationality left would be the irrationality of which pluralism as such is accused, and of this I hope to say a wordmore later.I have tired you with so many subtleties in this lecture that I will add only two other counts to my indictment.First, then, let me remind you that the absolute is useless for deductive purposes. It gives us absolute safety if youwill, but it is compatible with every relative danger. You cannot enter the phenomenal world with the notion of it inyour grasp, and name beforehand any detail which you are likely to meet there. Whatever the details of experiencemay prove to be, after the fact of them the absolute will adopt them. It is an hypothesis that functions retrospectivelyonly, not prospectively. That, whatever it may be, will have been in point of fact the sort of world which the absolutewas pleased to offer to itself as a spectacle.Again, the absolute is always represented idealistically, as the all-knower. Thinking this view consistently out leadsone to frame an almost ridiculous conception of the absolute mind, owing to the enormous mass of unprofitableinformation which it would then seem obliged to carry. One of the"},{"pageNumber":735,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP688 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 56]Page 688many reductiones ad absurdum of pluralism by which idealism thinks it proves the absolute One is as follows: Letthere be many facts; but since on idealist principles facts exist only by being known, the many facts will thereforemean many knowers. But that there are so many knowers is itself a fact, which in turn requires its knower, so the oneabsolute knower has eventually to be brought in. All facts lead to him. If it be a fact that this table is not a chair, not arhinoceros, not a logarithm, not a mile away from the door, not worth five hundred pounds sterling, not a thousandcenturies old, the absolute must even now be articulately aware of all these negations. Along with what everything isit must also be conscious of everything which it is not. This infinite atmosphere of explicit negativity—observe that ithas to be explicit—around everything seems to us so useless an encumbrance as to make the absolute still moreforeign to our sympathy. Furthermore, if it be a fact that certain ideas are silly, the absolute has to have alreadythought the silly ideas to establish them in silliness. The rubbish in its mind would thus appear easily to outweigh inamount the more desirable material. One would expect it fairly to burst with such an obesity, plethora, andsuperf tation of useless information.1I will spare you further objections. The sum of it all is that the absolute is not forced on our belief by logic, that itinvolves features of irrationality peculiar to itself, and that a thinker to whom it does not come as an 'immediatecertainty' (to use Mr. Joachim's words), is in no way bound to treat it as anything but an emotionally rather sublimehypothesis. As such, it might, with all its defects, be, on account of its peace-conferring power and its formalgrandeur, more rational than anything else in the field. But meanwhile the strung-along unfinished world in time is itsrival: reality MAY exist in distributive form, in the shape not of an all but of a set of eaches, just as it seems to—this isthe anti-absolutist hypothesis. Prima facie1Judging by the analogy of the relation which our central consciousness seems to bear to that of our spinal cord, lower ganglia, etc., itwould seem natural to suppose that in whatever superhuman mental synthesis there may be, the neglect and elimination of certaincontents of which we are conscious on the human level might be as characteristic a feature as is the combination and interweaving ofother human contents."},{"pageNumber":736,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP689 hl[01 03 2011 01 43 59]Page 689there is this in favor of the eaches, that they are at any rate real enough to have made themselves at least appear toevery one, whereas the absolute has as yet appeared immediately to only a few mystics, and indeed to them veryambiguously. The advocates of the absolute assure us that any distributive form of being is infected and underminedby self-contradiction. If we are unable to assimilate their arguments, and we have been unable, the only course we cantake, it seems to me, is to let the absolute bury the absolute, and to seek reality in more promising directions, evenamong the details of the finite and the immediately given.If these words of mine sound in bad taste to some of you, or even sacrilegious, I am sorry. Perhaps the impressionmay be mitigated by what I have to say in later lectures."},{"pageNumber":737,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP690 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 06]Page 690Lecture IVConcerning FechnerThe prestige of the absolute has rather crumbled in our hands. The logical proofs of it miss fire; the portraits which itsbest court-painters show of it are featureless and foggy in the extreme; and, apart from the cold comfort of assuring usthat with it all is well, and that to see that all is well with us also we need only rise to its eternal point of view, ityields us no relief whatever. It introduces, on the contrary, into philosophy and theology certain poisonous difficultiesof which but for its intrusion we never should have heard.But if we drop the absolute out of the world, must we then conclude that the world contains nothing better in the wayof consciousness than our consciousness? Is our whole instinctive belief in higher presences, our persistent innerturning towards divine companionship, to count for nothing? Is it but the pathetic illusion of beings with incorrigiblysocial and imaginative minds?Such a negative conclusion would, I believe, be desperately hasty, a sort of pouring out of the child with the bath.Logically it is possible to believe in superhuman beings without identifying them with the absolute at all. The treaty ofoffensive and defensive alliance which certain groups of the christian clergy have recently made with ourtranscendentalist philosophers seems to me to be based on a well-meaning but baleful mistake. Neither the Jehovah ofthe old testament nor the heavenly father of the new has anything in common with the absolute except that they are allthree greater than man; and if you say that the notion of the absolute is what the gods of Abraham, of David, and ofJesus, after first developing into each other, were inevitably destined to develop into in more reflective and modernminds, I reply that although in certain specifically philosophical minds this may have been the case, in minds moreproperly to be termed religious the development has followed quite another path. The whole history of evangelicalChristianity is there to prove it. I propose in these"},{"pageNumber":738,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP691 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 09]Page 691lectures to plead for that other line of development. To set the doctrine of the absolute in its proper framework, so thatit shall not fill the whole welkin and exclude all alternative possibilities of higher thought—as it seems to do for manystudents who approach it with a limited previous acquaintance with philosophy—I will contrast it with a systemwhich, abstractly considered, seems at first to have much in common with absolutism, but which, when takenconcretely and temperamentally, really stands at the opposite pole. I refer to the philosophy of Gustav TheodorFechner, a writer but little known as yet to English readers, but destined, I am persuaded, to wield more and moreinfluence as time goes on.It is the intense concreteness of Fechner, his fertility of detail, which fills me with an admiration which I should liketo make this audience share. Among the philosophic cranks of my acquaintance in the past was a lady all the tenets ofwhose system I have forgotten except one. Had she been born in the Ionian Archipelago some three thousand yearsago, that one doctrine would probably have made her name sure of a place in every university curriculum andexamination paper. The world, she said, is composed of only two elements, the Thick, namely, and the Thin. No onecan deny the truth of this analysis, as far as it goes (though in the light of our contemporary knowledge of nature ithas itself a rather 'thin' sound), and it is nowhere truer than in that part of the world called philosophy. I am sure, forexample, that many of you, listening to what poor account I have been able to give of transcendental idealism, havereceived an impression of its arguments being strangely thin, and of the terms it leaves us with being shiveringly thinwrappings for so thick and burly a world as this. Some of you of course will charge the thinness to my exposition; butthin as that has been, I believe the doctrines reported on to have been thinner. From Green to Haldane the absoluteproposed to us to straighten out the confusions of the thicket of experience in which our life is passed remains a pureabstraction which hardly any one tries to make a whit concreter. If we open Green, we get nothing but thetranscendental ego of apperception (Kant's name for the fact that to be counted in experience a thing has to bewitnessed), blown up into a sort of timeless soap-bubble large enough to mirror"},{"pageNumber":739,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP692 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 22]Page 692the whole universe. Nature, Green keeps insisting, consists only in relations, and these imply the action of a mind thatis eternal; a self-distinguishing consciousness which itself escapes from the relations by which it determines otherthings. Present to whatever is in succession, it is not in succession itself. If we take the Cairds, they tell us little moreof the principle of the universe—it is always a return into the identity of the self from the difference of its objects. Itseparates itself from them and so becomes conscious of them in their separation from one another, while at the sametime it binds them together as elements in one higher self-consciousness.This seems the very quintessence of thinness; and the matter hardly grows thicker when we gather, after enormousamounts of reading, that the great enveloping self in question is absolute reason as such, and that as such it ischaracterized by the habit of using certain jejune 'categories' with which to perform its eminent relating work. Thewhole active material of natural fact is tried out, and only the barest intellectualistic formalism remains.Hegel tried, as we saw, to make the system concreter by making the relations between things 'dialectic,' but if we turnto those who use his name most worshipfully, we find them giving up all the particulars of his attempt, and simplypraising his intention—much as in our manner we have praised it ourselves. Mr. Haldane, for example, in hiswonderfully clever Gifford lectures, praises Hegel to the skies, but what he tells of him amounts to little more thanthis, that 'the categories in which the mind arranges its experiences, and gives meaning to them, the universals inwhich the particulars are grasped in the individual, are a logical chain, in which the first presupposes the last, and thelast is its presupposition and its truth.' He hardly tries at all to thicken this thin logical scheme. He says indeed thatabsolute mind in itself, and absolute mind in its hetereity or otherness, under the distinction which it sets up of itselffrom itself, have as their real prius absolute mind in synthesis; and, this being absolute mind's true nature, its dialecticcharacter must show itself in such concrete forms as Goethe's and Wordsworth's poetry, as well as in religious forms.'The nature of God, the nature of absolute mind, is to exhibit the triple movement of dialectic, and so the nature of"},{"pageNumber":740,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP693 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 25]Page 693God as presented in religion must be a triplicity, a trinity.' But beyond thus naming Goethe and Wordsworth andestablishing the trinity, Mr. Haldane's Hegelianism carries us hardly an inch into the concrete detail of the world weactually inhabit.Equally thin is Mr. Taylor, both in his principles and in their results. Following Mr. Bradley, he starts by assuring usthat reality cannot be self-contradictory, but to be related to anything really outside of one's self is to be self-contradictory, so the ultimate reality must be a single all-inclusive systematic whole. Yet all he can say of this wholeat the end of his excellently written book is that the notion of it 'can make no addition to our information and can ofitself supply no motives for practical endeavor.'Mr. McTaggart treats us to almost as thin a fare. 'The main practical interest of Hegel's philosophy,' he says, 'is to befound in the abstract certainty which the logic gives us that all reality is rational and righteous, even when we cannotsee in the least how it is so. Not that it shows us how the facts around us are good, not that it shows us how we canmake them better, but that it proves that they, like other reality, are sub specie eternitatis, perfectly good, and subspecie temporis, destined to become perfectly good.'Here again, no detail whatever, only the abstract certainty that whatever the detail may prove to be, it will be good.Common non-dialectical men have already this certainty as a result of the generous vital enthusiasm about theuniverse with which they are born. The peculiarity of transcendental philosophy is its sovereign contempt for merelyvital functions like enthusiasm, and its pretension to turn our simple and immediate trusts and faiths into the form oflogically mediated certainties, to question which would be absurd. But the whole basis on which Mr. McTaggart's owncertainty so solidly rests, settles down into the one nutshell of an assertion into which he puts Hegel's gospel, namely,that in every bit of experience and thought, however finite, the whole of reality (the absolute idea, as Hegel calls it) is'implicitly present.'This indeed is Hegel's vision, and Hegel thought that the details of his dialectic proved its truth. But disciples whotreat the details of the proof as unsatisfactory and yet cling to the"},{"pageNumber":741,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP694 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 28]Page 694vision, are surely, in spite of their pretension to a more rational consciousness, no better than common men with theirenthusiasms or deliberately adopted faiths. We have ourselves seen some of the weakness of the monistic proofs. Mr.McTaggart picks plenty of holes of his own in Hegel's logic, and finally concludes that 'all true philosophy must bemystical, not indeed in its methods but in its final conclusions,' which is as much as to say that the rationalisticmethods leave us in the lurch, in spite of all their superiority, and that in the end vision and faith must eke them out.But how abstract and thin is here the vision, to say nothing of the faith! The whole of reality, explicitly absent fromour finite experiences, must nevertheless be present in them all implicitly, altho no one of us can ever see how—thebare word 'implicit' here bearing the whole pyramid of the monistic system on its slender point. Mr. Joachim'smonistic system of truth rests on an even slenderer point.—'I have never doubted,' he says, 'that universal and timelesstruth is a single content or significance, one and whole and complete,' and he candidly confesses the failure ofrationalistic attempts 'to raise this immediate certainty' to the level of reflective knowledge. There is, in short, nomediation for him between the Truth in capital letters and all the little 'lower-case' truths—and errors—which lifepresents. The psychological fact that he never has 'doubted' is enough.The whole monistic pyramid, resting on points as thin as these, seems to me to be a machtspruch, a product of will farmore than one of reason. Unity is good, therefore things shall cohere; they shall be one; there shall be categories tomake them one, no matter what empirical disjunctions may appear. In Hegel's own writings, the shall-be temper isubiquitous and towering; it overrides verbal and logical resistances alike. Hegel's error, as Professor Royce so wellsays, 'lay not in introducing logic into passion,' as some people charge, 'but in conceiving the logic of passion as theonly logic. He is [thus] suggestive,' Royce says, 'but never final. His system as a system has crumbled, but his vitalcomprehension of our life remains forever.'11The Spirit of Modern Philosophy, p. 227."},{"pageNumber":742,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP695 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 31]Page 695That vital comprehension we have already seen. It is that there is a sense in which real things are not merely their ownbare selves, but may vaguely be treated as also their own others, and that ordinary logic, since it denies this, must beovercome. Ordinary logic denies this because it substitutes concepts for real things, and concepts are their own bareselves and nothing else. What Royce calls Hegel's 'system' was Hegel's attempt to make us believe that he wasworking by concepts and grinding out a higher style of logic, when in reality sensible experiences, hypotheses, andpassion furnished him with all his results.What I myself may mean by things being their own others, we shall see in a later lecture. It is now time to take ourlook at Fechner, whose thickness is a refreshing contrast to the thin, abstract, indigent, and threadbare appearance, thestarving, school-room aspect, which the speculations of most of our absolutist philosophers present.There is something really weird and uncanny in the contrast between the abstract pretensions of rationalism and whatrationalistic methods concretely can do. If the 'logical prius' of our mind were really the 'implicit presence' of thewhole 'concrete universal,' the whole of reason, or reality, or spirit, or the absolute idea, or whatever it may be called,in all our finite thinking, and if this reason worked (for example) by the dialectical method, does n't it seem odd that inthe greatest instance of rationalization mankind has known, in 'science,' namely, the dialectical method should neveronce have been tried? Not a solitary instance of the use of it in science occurs to my mind. Hypotheses, anddeductions from these, controlled by sense-observations and analogies with what we know elsewhere, are to bethanked for all of science's results.Fechner used no methods but these latter ones in arguing for his metaphysical conclusions about reality—but let mefirst rehearse a few of the facts about his life.Born in 1801, the son of a poor country pastor in Saxony, he lived from 1817 to 1887, when he died, seventy yearstherefore, at Leipzig, a typical gelehrter of the old-fashioned german stripe. His means were always scanty, so hisonly extravagances could be in the way of thought, but these were gorgeous ones. He passed his medical examinationsat"},{"pageNumber":743,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP696 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 33]Page 696Leipzig University at the age of twenty-one, but decided, instead of becoming a doctor, to devote himself to physicalscience. It was ten years before he was made professor of physics, although he soon was authorized to lecture. Mean-while, he had to make both ends meet, and this he did by voluminous literary labors. He translated, for example, thefour volumes of Biot's treatise on physics, and the six of Thénard's work on chemistry, and took care of their enlargededitions later. He edited repertories of chemistry and physics, a pharmaceutical journal, and an encyclopædia in eightvolumes, of which he wrote about one third. He published physical treatises and experimental investigations of hisown, especially in electricity. Electrical measurements, as you know, are the basis of electrical science, and Fechner'smeasurements in galvanism, performed with the simplest self-made apparatus, are classic to this day. During this timehe also published a number of half-philosophical, half-humorous writings, which have gone through several editions,under the name of Dr. Mises, besides poems, literary and artistic essays, and other occasional articles.But overwork, poverty, and an eye-trouble produced by his observations on after-images in the retina (also a classicpiece of investigation) produced in Fechner, then about thirty-eight years old, a terrific attack of nervous prostrationwith painful hyperæsthesia of all the functions, from which he suffered three years, cut off entirely from active life.Present-day medicine would have classed poor Fechner's malady quickly enough, as partly a habit-neurosis, but itsseverity was such that in his day it was treated as a visitation incomprehensible in its malignity; and when he suddenlybegan to get well, both Fechner and others treated the recovery as a sort of divine miracle. This illness, bringingFechner face to face with inner desperation, made a great crisis in his life. 'Had I not then clung to the faith,' he writes,'that clinging to faith would somehow or other work its reward, so hätte ich jene zeit nicht ausgehalten.' His religiousand cosmological faiths saved him—thenceforward one great aim with him was to work out and communicate thesefaiths to the world. He did so on the largest scale; but he did many other things too ere he died."},{"pageNumber":744,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP697 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 34]Page 697A book on the atomic theory, classic also; four elaborate mathematical and experimental volumes on what he calledpsychophysics—many persons consider Fechner to have practically founded scientific psychology in the first of thesebooks; a volume on organic evolution, and two works on experimental æsthetics, in which again Fechner is consideredby some judges to have laid the foundations of a new science, must be included among these other performances. Ofthe more religious and philosophical works, I shall immediately give a further account.All Leipzig mourned him when he died, for he was the pattern of the ideal german scholar, as daringly original in histhought as he was homely in his life, a modest, genial, laborious slave to truth and learning, and withal the owner ofan admirable literary style of the vernacular sort. The materialistic generation, that in the fifties and sixties called hisspeculations fantastic, had been replaced by one with greater liberty of imagination, and a Preyer, a Wundt, a Paulsen,and a Lasswitz could now speak of Fechner as their master.His mind was indeed one of those multitudinously organized cross-roads of truth which are occupied only at rareintervals by children of men, and from which nothing is either too far or too near to be seen in due perspective.Patientest observation, exactest mathematics, shrewdest discrimination, humanest feeling, flourished in him on thelargest scale, with no apparent detriment to one another. He was in fact a philosopher in the 'great' sense, altho hecared so much less than most philosophers care for abstractions of the 'thin' order. For him the abstract lived in theconcrete, and the hidden motive of all he did was to bring what he called the daylight view of the world into evergreater evidence, that daylight view being this, that the whole universe in its different spans and wave-lengths,exclusions and envelopments, is everywhere alive and conscious. It has taken fifty years for his chief book, 'Zend-avesta,' to pass into a second edition (1901). 'One swallow,' he cheerfully writes, 'does not make a summer. But thefirst swallow would not come unless the summer were coming; and for me that summer means my daylight view sometime prevailing.'The original sin, according to Fechner, of both our popular"},{"pageNumber":745,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP698 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 35]Page 698and our scientific thinking, is our inveterate habit of regarding the spiritual not as the rule but as an exception in themidst of nature. Instead of believing our life to be fed at the breasts of the greater life, our individuality to besustained by the greater individuality, which must necessarily have more consciousness and more independence thanall that it brings forth, we habitually treat whatever lies outside of our life as so much slag and ashes of life only; or ifwe believer in a Divine Spirit, we fancy him on the one side as bodiless, and nature as soulless on the other. Whatcomfort, or peace, Fechner asks, can come from such a doctrine? The flowers wither at its breath, the stars turn intostone; our own body grows unworthy of our spirit and sinks to a tenement for carnal senses only. The book of natureturns into a volume on mechanics, in which whatever has life is treated as a sort of anomaly; a great chasm ofseparation yawns between us and all that is higher than ourselves; and God becomes a thin nest of abstractions.Fechner's great instrument for vivifying the daylight view is analogy; not a rationalistic argument is to be found in allhis many pages—only reasonings like those which men continually use in practical life. For example: My house isbuilt by some one, the world too is built by some one. The world is greater than my house, it must be a greater someone who built the world. My body moves by the influence of my feeling and will; the sun, moon, sea, and wind, beingthemselves more powerful, move by the influence of some more powerful feeling and will. I live now, and changefrom one day to another; I shall live hereafter, and change still more, etc.Bain defines genius as the power of seeing analogies. The number that Fechner could perceive was prodigious; but heinsisted on the differences as well. Neglect to make allowance for these, he said, is the common fallacy in analogicalreasoning. Most of us, for example, reasoning justly that, since all the minds we know are connected with bodies,therefore God's mind should be connected with a body, proceed to suppose that that body must be just an animal bodyover again, and paint an altogether human picture of God. But all that the analogy comports is a body—the particularfeatures of our body are adaptations to a habitat so different from"},{"pageNumber":746,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP699 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 42]Page 699God's that if God have a physical body at all, it must be utterly different from ours in structure. Throughout hiswritings Fechner makes difference and analogy walk abreast, and by his extraordinary power of noticing both, heconverts what would ordinarily pass for objections to his conclusions into factors of their support.The vaster orders of mind go with the vaster orders of body. The entire earth on which we live must have, accordingto Fechner, its own collective consciousness. So must each sun, moon, and planet; so must the whole solar systemhave its own wider consciousness, in which the consciousness of our earth plays one part. So has the entire starrysystem as such its consciousness; and if that starry system be not the sum of all that is, materially considered, then thatwhole system, along with whatever else may be, is the body of that absolutely totalized consciousness of the universeto which men give the name of God.Speculatively Fechner is thus a monist in his theology; but there is room in his universe for every grade of spiritualbeing between man and the final all-inclusive God; and in suggesting what the positive content of all this super-humanity may be, he hardly lets his imagination fly beyond simple spirits of the planetary order. The earth-soul hepassionately believes in; he treats the earth as our special human guardian angel; we can pray to the earth as men prayto their saints; but I think that in his system, as in so many of the actual historic theologies, the supreme God marksonly a sort of limit of enclosure of the worlds above man. He is left thin and abstract in his majesty, men preferring tocarry on their personal transactions with the many less remote and abstract messengers and mediators whom the divineorder provides.I shall ask later whether the abstractly monistic turn which Fechner's speculations took was necessitated by logic. Ibelieve it not to have been required. Meanwhile let me lead you a little more into the detail of his thought. Inevitablyone does him miserable injustice by summarizing and abridging him. For altho the type of reasoning he employs isalmost childlike for simplicity, and his bare conclusions can be written on a single page, the power of the man is duealtogether to the profuseness of his concrete imagination, to the multi-"},{"pageNumber":747,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP700 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 43]Page 700tude of the points which he considers successively, to the cumulative effect of his learning, of his thoroughness, andof the ingenuity of his detail, to his admirably homely style, to the sincerity with which his pages glow, and finally tothe impression he gives of a man who does n't live at secondhand, but who sees, who in fact speaks as one havingauthority, and not as if he were one of the common herd of professorial philosophic scribes.Abstractly set down, his most important conclusion for my purpose in these lectures is that the constitution of theworld is identical throughout. In ourselves, visual consciousness goes with our eyes, tactile consciousness with ourskin. But altho neither skin nor eye knows aught of the sensations of the other, they come together and figure in somesort of relation and combination in the more inclusive consciousness which each of us names his self. Quite similarly,then, says Fechner, we must suppose that my consciousness of myself and yours of yourself, altho in their immediacythey keep separate and know nothing of each other, are yet known and used together in a higher consciousness, that ofthe human race, say, into which they enter as constituent parts. Similarly, the whole human and animal kingdomscome together as conditions of a consciousness of still wider scope. This combines in the soul of the earth with theconsciousness of the vegetable kingdom, which in turn contributes its share of experience to that of the whole solarsystem, and so on from synthesis to synthesis and height to height, till an absolutely universal consciousness isreached.A vast analogical series, in which the basis of the analogy consists of facts directly observable in ourselves.The supposition of an earth-consciousness meets a strong instinctive prejudice which Fechner ingeniously tries toovercome. Man's mind is the highest consciousness upon the earth, we think—the earth itself being in all ways man'sinferior. How should its consciousness, if it have one, be superior to his?What are the marks of superiority which we are tempted to use here? If we look more carefully into them, Fechnerpoints out that the earth possesses each and all of them more perfectly than we. He considers in detail the points ofdifference"},{"pageNumber":748,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP701 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 44]Page 701between us, and shows them all to make for the earth's higher rank. I will touch on only a few of these points.One of them of course is independence of other external beings. External to the earth are only the other heavenlybodies. All the things on which we externally depend for life—air, water, plant and animal food, fellow men, etc.—areincluded in her as her constituent parts. She is self-sufficing in a million respects in which we are not so. We dependon her for almost everything, she on us for but a small portion of her history. She swings us in her orbit from winterto summer and revolves us from day into night and from night into day.Complexity in unity is another sign of superiority. The total earth's complexity far exceeds that of any organism, forshe includes all our organisms in herself, along with an infinite number of things that our organisms fail to include.Yet how simple and massive are the phases of her own proper life! As the total bearing of any animal is sedate andtranquil compared with the agitation of its blood corpuscles, so is the earth a sedate and tranquil being compared withthe animals whom she supports.To develop from within, instead of being fashioned from without, is also counted as something superior in men's eyes.An egg is a higher style of being than a piece of clay which an external modeler makes into the image of a bird. Well,the earth's history develops from within. It is like that of a wonderful egg which the sun's heat, like that of a mother-hen, has stimulated to its cycles of evolutionary change.Individuality of type, and difference from other beings of its type, is another mark of rank. The earth differs fromevery other planet, and as a class planetary beings are extraordinarily distinct from other beings.Long ago the earth was called an animal; but a planet is a higher class of being than either man or animal; not onlyquantitatively greater, like a vaster and more awkward whale or elephant, but a being whose enormous size requiresan altogether different plan of life. Our animal organization comes from our inferiority. Our need of moving to andfro, of stretching our limbs and bending our bodies, shows only our defect. What are our legs but crutches, by meansof"},{"pageNumber":749,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP702 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 46]Page 702which, with restless efforts, we go hunting after the things we have not inside of ourselves. But the earth is no suchcripple; why should she who already possesses within herself the things we so painfully pursue, have limbs analogousto ours? Shall she mimic a small part of herself? What need has she of arms, with nothing to reach for? of a neck,with no head to carry? of eyes or nose when she finds her way through space without either, and has the millions ofeyes of all her animals to guide their movements on her surface, and all their noses to smell the flowers that grow?For, as we are ourselves a part of the earth, so our organs are her organs. She is, as it were, eye and ear over herwhole extent—all that we see and hear in separation she sees and hears at once. She brings forth living beings ofcountless kinds upon her surface, and their multitudinous conscious relations with each other she takes up into herhigher and more general conscious life.Most of us, considering the theory that the whole terrestrial mass is animated as our bodies are, make the mistake ofworking the analogy too literally, and allowing for no differences. If the earth be a sentient organism, we say, whereare her brain and nerves? What corresponds to her heart and lungs? In other words, we expect functions which shealready performs through us, to be performed outside of us again, and in just the same way. But we see perfectly wellhow the earth performs some of these functions in a way unlike our way. If you speak of circulation, what need hasshe of a heart when the sun keeps all the showers of rain that fall upon her and all the springs and brooks and riversthat irrigate her, going? What need has she of internal lungs, when her whole sensitive surface is in living commercewith the atmosphere that clings to it?The organ that gives us most trouble is the brain. All the consciousness we directly know seems tied to brains.—Canthere be consciousness, we ask, where there is no brain? But our brain, which primarily serves to correlate ourmuscular reactions with the external objects on which we depend, performs a function which the earth performs in anentirely different way. She has no proper muscles or limbs of her own, and the only objects external to her are theother stars. To these her whole mass reacts by most exquisite alterations in"},{"pageNumber":750,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP703 hl[01 03 2011 01 44 57]Page 703its total gait, and by still more exquisite vibratory responses in its substance. Her ocean reflects the lights of heaven asin a mighty mirror, her atmosphere refracts them like a monstrous lens, the clouds and snow-fields combine them intowhite, the woods and flowers disperse them into colors. Polarization, interference, absorption, awaken sensibilities inmatter of which our senses are too coarse to take any note.For these cosmic relations of hers, then, she no more needs a special brain than she needs eyes or ears. Our brains doindeed unify and correlate innumerable functions. Our eyes know nothing of sound, our ears nothing of light, but,having brains, we can feel sound and light together, and compare them. We account for this by the fibres which in thebrain connect the optical with the acoustic centre, but just how these fibres bring together not only the centre, but thesensations, we fail to see. But if fibres are indeed all that is needed to do that trick, has not the earth pathways, bywhich you and I are physically continuous, more than enough to do for our two minds what the brain-fibres do for thesounds and sights in a single mind? Must every higher means of unification between things be a literal brain-fibre,and go by that name? Cannot the earth-mind know otherwise the contents of our minds together?Fechner's imagination, insisting on the differences as well as on the resemblances, thus tries to make our picture of thewhole earth's life more concrete. He revels in the thought of its perfections. To carry her precious freight through thehours and seasons what form could be more excellent than hers—being as it is horse, wheels, and wagon all in one.Think of her beauty—a shining ball, sky-blue and sun-lit over one half, the other bathed in starry night, reflecting theheavens from all her waters, myriads of lights and shadows in the folds of her mountains and windings of her valleys,she would be a spectacle of rainbow glory, could one only see her from afar as we see parts of her from her ownmountain-tops. Every quality of landscape that has a name would then be visible in her at once—all that is delicate orgraceful, all that is quiet, or wild, or romantic, or desolate, or cheerful, or luxuriant, or fresh.

Green would be the dominant color, but the blue atmosphere and the clouds would enfold heras a bride is shrouded in her veil—a veil the vapory transparent folds of which the earth, through her ministers thewinds, never tires of laying and folding about herself anew.Every element has its own living denizens. Can the celestial ocean of ether, whose waves are light, in which the earthherself floats, not have hers, higher by as much as their element is higher, swimming without fins, flying withoutwings, moving, immense and tranquil, as by a half-spiritual force through the half-spiritual sea which they inhabit,rejoicing in the exchange of luminous influence with one another, following the slightest pull of one another'sattraction, and harboring, each of them, an inexhaustible inward wealth?Men have always made fables about angels, dwelling in the light, needing no earthly food or drink, messengersbetween ourselves and God. Here are actually existent beings, dwelling in the light and moving through the sky,needing neither food nor drink, intermediaries between God and us, obeying his commands. So, if the heavens reallyare the home of angels, the heavenly bodies must be those very angels, for other creatures there are none. Yes! theearth is our great common guardian angel, who watches over all our interests combined.In a striking page Fechner relates one of his moments of direct vision of this truth. 'On a certain spring morning Iwent out to walk. The fields were green, the birds sang, the dew glistened, the smoke was rising, here and there a manappeared; a light as of transfiguration lay on all things. It was only a little bit of the earth; it was only one moment ofher existence; and yet as my look embraced her more and more it seemed to me not only so beautiful an idea, but sotrue and clear a fact, that she is an angel, an angel so rich and fresh and flower-like, and yet going her round in theskies so firmly and so at one with herself, turning her whole living face to Heaven, and carrying me along with herinto that Heaven, that I asked myself how the opinions of men could ever have so spun themselves away from life sofar as to deem the earth only a dry clod, and to seek for angels above it or about it in the emptiness of the sky,—onlyto find them nowhere. But such an ex-"},{"pageNumber":752,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP705 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 00]Page 705perience as this passes for fantastic. The earth is a globular body, and what more she may be, one can find inmineralogical cabinets.'1Where there is no vision the people perish. Few professorial philosophers have any vision. Fechner had vision, andthat is why one can read him over and over again, and each time bring away a fresh sense of reality.His earliest book was a vision of what the inner life of plants may be like. He called it 'Nanna.' In the development ofanimals the nervous system is the central fact. Plants develop centrifugally, spread their organs abroad. For that reasonpeople suppose that they can have no consciousness, for they lack the unity which the central nervous systemprovides. But the plant's consciousness may be of another type, being connected with other structures. Violins andpianos give out sounds because they have strings. Does it follow that nothing but strings can give out sound? Howthen about flutes and organ-pipes? Of course their sounds are of a different quality, and so may the consciousness ofplants be of a quality correlated exclusively with the kind of organization that they possess. Nutrition, respiration,propagation take place in them without nerves. In us these functions are conscious only in unusual states, normallytheir consciousness is eclipsed by that which goes with the brain. No such eclipse occurs in plants, and their lowerconsciousness may therefore be all the more lively. With nothing to do but to drink the light and air with their leaves,to let their cells proliferate, to feel their rootlets draw the sap, is it conceivable that they should not consciously sufferif water, light, and air are suddenly withdrawn? or that when the flowering and fertilization which are the culminationof their life take place, they should not feel their own existence more intensely and enjoy something like what we callpleasure in ourselves? Does the water-lily, rocking in her triple bath of water, air, and light, relish in no wise her ownbeauty? When the plant in our room turns to the light, closes her blossoms in the dark, responds to our watering orpruning by increase of size or change of shape and bloom, who has the right to say she does not feel, or that she playsa1Fechner: Über die Seelenfrage, 1861, p. 170."},{"pageNumber":753,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP706 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 01]Page 706purely passive part? Truly plants can foresee nothing, neither the scythe of the mower, nor the hand extended to plucktheir flowers. They can neither run away nor cry out. But this only proves how different their modes of feeling lifemust be from those of animals that live by eyes and ears and locomotive organs, it does not prove that they have nomode of feeling life at all.How scanty and scattered would sensation be on our globe, if the feeling-life of plants were blotted from existence.Solitary would consciousness move through the woods in the shape of some deer or other quadruped, or fly about theflowers in that of some insect, but can we really suppose that the Nature through which God's breath blows is such abarren wilderness as this?I have probably by this time said enough to acquaint those of you who have never seen these metaphysical writings ofFechner with their more general characteristics, and I hope that some of you may now feel like reading themyourselves.1 The special thought of Fechner's with which in these lectures I have most practical concern, is his beliefthat the more inclusive forms of consciousness are in part constituted by the more limited forms. Not that they are themere sum of the more limited forms. As our mind is not the bare sum of our sights plus our sounds plus our pains, butin adding these terms together also finds relations among them and weaves them into schemes and forms and objectsof which no one sense in its separate estate knows anything, so the earth-soul traces relations between the contents ofmy mind and the contents of yours of which neither of our separate minds is conscious. It has schemes, forms, andobjects proportionate to its wider field, which our mental fields are far too narrow to cognize. By ourselves we aresimply out of relation with each other, for it we are both of us there, and different from each other, which is a positiverelation. What we are without knowing, it knows that we are. We are closed against its1Fechner's latest summarizing of his views, Die Tagesansicht gegenüber der Nachtansicht, Leipzig, 1879, is now, I understand, inprocess of translation. His Little Book of Life after Death exists already in two American versions, one published by Little, Brown &Co., Boston, the other by the Open Court Co., Chicago."},{"pageNumber":754,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP707 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 02]Page 707world, but that world is not closed against us. It is as if the total universe of inner life had a sort of grain or direction,a sort of valvular structure, permitting knowledge to flow in one way only, so that the wider might always have thenarrower under observation, but never the narrower the wider.Fechner's great analogy here is the relation of the senses to our individual minds. When our eyes are open theirsensations enter into our general mental life, which grows incessantly by the addition of what they see. Close the eyes,however, and the visual additions stop, nothing but thoughts and memories of the past visual experiences remain—incombination of course with the enormous stock of other thoughts and memories, and with the data coming in from thesenses not yet closed. Our eye-sensations of themselves know nothing of this enormous life into which they fall.Fechner thinks, as any common man would think, that they are taken into it directly when they occur, and form part ofit just as they are. They don't stay outside and get represented inside by their copies. It is only the memories andconcepts of them that are copies; the sensible perceptions themselves are taken in or walled out in their own properpersons according as the eyes are open or shut.Fechner likens our individual persons on the earth unto so many sense-organs of the earth's soul. We add to itsperceptive life so long as our own life lasts. It absorbs our perceptions, just as they occur, into its larger sphere ofknowledge, and combines them with the other data there. When one of us dies, it is as if an eye of the world wereclosed, for all perceptive contributions from that particular quarter cease. But the memories and conceptual relationsthat have spun themselves round the perceptions of that person remain in the larger earth-life as distinct as ever, andform new relations and grow and develop throughout all the future, in the same way in which our own distinct objectsof thought, once stored in memory, form new relations and develop throughout our whole finite life. This is Fechner'stheory of immortality, first published in the little 'Büchlein des lebens nach dem tode,' in 1836, and re-edited ingreatly improved shape in the last volume of his 'Zend-avesta.'We rise upon the earth as wavelets rise upon the ocean.

The wavelets catch the sunbeams separately, the leaves stir when thebranches do not move. They realize their own events apart, just as in our own consciousness, when anything becomesemphatic, the background fades from observation. Yet the event works back upon the background, as the waveletworks upon the waves, or as the leaf's movements work upon the sap inside the branch. The whole sea and the wholetree are registers of what has happened, and are different for the wave's and the leaf's action having occurred. Agrafted twig may modify its scion to the roots:—so our outlived private experiences, impressed on the whole earth-mind as memories, lead the immortal life of ideas there, and become parts of the great system, fully distinguishedfrom one another, just as we ourselves when alive were distinct, realizing themselves no longer isolatedly, but alongwith one another as so many partial systems, entering thus into new combinations, being affected by the perceptiveexperiences of those living then, and affecting the living in their turn—altho they are so seldom recognized by livingmen to do so.If you imagine that this entrance after the death of the body into a common life of higher type means a merging andloss of our distinct personality, Fechner asks you whether a visual sensation of our own exists in any sense less foritself or less distinctly, when it enters into our higher relational consciousness and is there distinguished and defined.—But here I must stop my reporting and send you to his volumes. Thus is the universe alive, according to thisphilosopher! I think you will admit that he makes it more thickly alive than do the other philosophers who, followingrationalistic methods solely, gain the same results, but only in the thinnest outlines. Both Fechner and ProfessorRoyce, for example, believe ultimately in one all-inclusive mind. Both believe that we, just as we stand here, areconstituent parts of that mind. No other content has it than us, with all the other creatures like or unlike us, and therelations which it finds between us. Our eaches, collected into one, are substantively identical with its all, tho the all isperfect while no each is perfect, so that we have to admit that new qualities as well as unperceived relations accruefrom the collective form. It is"},{"pageNumber":756,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP709 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 05]Page 709thus superior to the distributive form. But having reached this result, Royce (tho his treatment of the subject on itsmoral side seems to me infinitely richer and thicker than that of any other contemporary idealistic philosopher) leavesus very much to our own devices. Fechner, on the contrary, tries to trace the superiorities due to the more collectiveform in as much detail as he can. He marks the various intermediary stages and halting places of collectivity,—as weare to our separate senses, so is the earth to us, so is the solar system to the earth, etc.,—and if, in order to escape aninfinitely long summation, he posits a complete God as the all-container and leaves him about as indefinite in featureas the idealists leave their absolute, he yet provides us with a very definite gate of approach to him in the shape of theearth-soul, through which in the nature of things we must first make connexion with all the more envelopingsuperhuman realms, and with which our more immediate religious commerce at any rate has to be carried on.Ordinary monistic idealism leaves everything intermediary out. It recognizes only the extremes, as if, after the firstrude face of the phenomenal world in all its particularity, nothing but the supreme in all its perfection could be found.First, you and I, just as we are in this room; and the moment we get below that surface, the unutterable absolute itself!Does n't this show a singularly indigent imagination? Is n't this brave universe made on a richer pattern, with room init for a long hierarchy of beings? Materialistic science makes it infinitely richer in terms, with its molecules, and ether,and electrons, and what not. Absolute idealism, thinking of reality only under intellectual forms, knows not what to dowith bodies of any grade, and can make no use of any psychophysical analogy or correspondence. The resultantthinness is startling when compared with the thickness and articulation of such a universe as Fechner paints. May notsatisfaction with the rationalistic absolute as the alpha and omega, and treatment of it in all its abstraction as anadequate religious object, argue a certain native poverty of mental demand? Things reveal themselves soonest to thosewho most passionately want them, for our need sharpens our wit. To a mind content with little, the much in theuniverse may always remain hid."},{"pageNumber":757,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP710 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 06]Page 710To be candid, one of my reasons for saying so much about Fechner has been to make the thinness of our currenttranscendentalism appear more evident by an effect of contrast. Scholasticism ran thick; Hegel himself ran thick; butenglish and american transcendentalisms run thin. If philosophy is more a matter of passionate vision than of logic,—and I believe it is, logic only finding reasons for the vision afterwards,—must not such thinness come either from thevision being defective in the disciples, or from their passion, matched with Fechner's or with Hegel's own passion,being as moonlight unto sunlight or as water unto wine?1But I have also a much deeper reason for making Fechner a part of my text. His assumption that consciousexperiences freely compound and separate themselves, the same assumption by which absolutism explains the relationof our minds to the eternal mind, and the same by which empiricism explains the composition of the human mind outof subordinate mental elements, is not one which we ought to let pass without scrutiny. I shall scrutinize it in the nextlecture.1Mr. Bradley ought to be to some degree exempted from my attack in these last pages.

I owe to Fechner's shade an apology for presenting him in amanner so unfair to the most essential quality of his genius; but the time allotted is too short to say more about theparticulars of his work, so I proceed to the programme I suggested at the end of our last hour. I wish to discuss theassumption that states of consciousness, so-called, can separate and combine themselves freely, and keep their ownidentity unchanged while forming parts of simultaneous fields of experience of wider scope.Let me first explain just what I mean by this. While you listen to my voice, for example, you are perhaps inattentiveto some bodily sensation due to your clothing or your posture. Yet that sensation would seem probably to be there, forin an instant, by a change of attention, you can have it in one field of consciousness with the voice. It seems as if itexisted first in a separate form, and then as if, without itself changing, it combined with your other co-existentsensations. It is after this analogy that pantheistic idealism thinks that we exist in the absolute. The absolute, it thinks,makes the world by knowing the whole of it at once in one undivided eternal act.1 To 'be,' really to be, is to be as itknows us to be, along with everything else, namely, and clothed with the fulness of our meaning. Meanwhile we areat the same time not only really and as it knows us, but also apparently, for to our separate single selves we appearwithout most other things and unable to declare with any fulness what our own meaning is. Now the classic doctrineof pantheistic idealism, from the Upanishads down to Josiah Royce, is that the finite knowers, in spite of theirapparent ignorance, are one with the knower of the all. In the most limited moments of our private experience, theabsolute idea, as Dr. McTaggart told us, is implicitly1Royce: The Spirit of Modern Philosophy, p. 379."},{"pageNumber":759,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP712 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 08]Page 712contained. The moments, as Royce says, exist only in relation to it. They are true or erroneous only through itsovershadowing presence. Of the larger self that alone eternally is, they are the organic parts. They are, only inasmuchas they are implicated in its being.There is thus in reality but this one self, consciously inclusive of all the lesser selves, logos, problem-solver, and all-knower; and Royce ingeniously compares the ignorance that in our persons breaks out in the midst of its completeknowledge and isolates me from you and both of us from it, to the inattention into which our finite minds are liable tofall with respect to such implicitly present details as those corporeal sensations to which I made allusion just now.Those sensations stand to our total private minds in the same relation in which our private minds stand to the absolutemind. Privacy means ignorance—I still quote Royce—and ignorance means inattention. We are finite because ourwills, as such, are only fragments of the absolute will; because will means interest, and an incomplete will means anincomplete interest; and because incompleteness of interest means inattention to much that a fuller interest wouldbring us to perceive.1In this account Royce makes by far the manliest of the post-hegelian attempts to read some empirically apprehensiblecontent into the notion of our relation to the absolute mind.I have to admit, now that I propose to you to scrutinize this assumption rather closely, that trepidation seizes me. Thesubject is a subtle and abstruse one. It is one thing to delve into subtleties by one's self with pen in hand, or to studyout abstruse points in books, but quite another thing to make a popular lecture out of them. Nevertheless I must notflinch from my task here, for I think that this particular point forms perhaps the vital knot of the present philosophicsituation, and I imagine that the times are ripe, or almost ripe, for a serious attempt to be made at its untying.It may perhaps help to lessen the arduousness of the subject if I put the first part of what I have to say in the form of adirect personal confession.In the year 1890 I published a work on psychology in which1The World and the Individual, vol. ii, pp. 58 62."},{"pageNumber":760,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP713 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 09]Page 713it became my duty to discuss the value of a certain explanation of our higher mental states that had come into favoramong the more biologically inclined psychologists. Suggested partly by the association of ideas, and partly by theanalogy of chemical compounds, this opinion was that complex mental states are resultants of the self-compoundingof simpler ones. The Mills had spoken of mental chemistry; Wundt of a 'psychic synthesis,' which might developproperties not contained in the elements; and such writers as Spencer, Taine, Fiske, Barratt, and Clifford hadpropounded a great evolutionary theory in which, in the absence of souls, selves, or other principles of unity,primordial units of mind-stuff or mind-dust were represented as summing themselves together in successive stages ofcompounding and re-compounding, and thus engendering our higher and more complex states of mind. Theelementary feeling of A, let us say, and the elementary feeling of B, when they occur in certain conditions, combine,according to this doctrine, into a feeling of A-plus-B, and this in turn combines with a similarly generated feeling ofC-plus-D, until at last the whole alphabet may appear together in one field of awareness, without any other witnessingprinciple or principles beyond the feelings of the several letters themselves, being supposed to exist. What each ofthem witnesses separately, 'all' of them are supposed to witness in conjunction. But their distributive knowledge doesn't give rise to their collective knowledge by any act, it is their collective knowledge. The lower forms ofconsciousness 'taken together' are the higher. It, 'taken apart,' consists of nothing and is nothing but them. This, atleast, is the most obvious way of understanding the doctrine, and is the way I understood it in the chapter in mypsychology.Superficially looked at, this seems just like the combination of H2 and O into water, but looked at more closely, theanalogy halts badly. When a chemist tells us that two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen combine themselves oftheir own accord into the new compound substance 'water,' he knows (if he believes in the mechanical view of nature)that this is only an elliptical statement for a more complex fact. That fact is that when H2 and O, instead of keeping farapart, get into closer quarters, say into the position H-O-H, they"},{"pageNumber":761,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP714 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 10]Page 714affect surrounding bodies differently: they now wet our skin, dissolve sugar, put out fire, etc., which they did n't intheir former positions. 'Water' is but our name for what acts thus peculiarly. But if the skin, sugar, and fire wereabsent, no witness would speak of water at all. He would still talk of the H and O distributively, merely noting thatthey acted now in the new position H-O-H.In the older psychologies the soul or self took the place of the sugar, fire, or skin. The lower feelings produced effectson it, and their apparent compounds were only its reactions. As you tickle a man's face with a feather, and he laughs,so when you tickle his intellectual principle with a retinal feeling, say, and a muscular feeling at once, it laughsresponsively by its category of 'space,' but it would be false to treat the space as simply made of those simplerfeelings. It is rather a new and unique psychic creation which their combined action on the mind is able to evoke.I found myself obliged, in discussing the mind-dust theory, to urge this last alternative view. The so-called mentalcompounds are simple psychic reactions of a higher type. The form itself of them, I said, is something new. We can'tsay that awareness of the alphabet as such is nothing more than twenty-six awarenesses, each of a separate letter; forthose are twenty-six distinct awarenesses, of single letters without others, while their so-called sum is one awareness,of every letter with its comrades. There is thus something new in the collective consciousness. It knows the sameletters, indeed, but it knows them in this novel way. It is safer, I said (for I fought shy of admitting a self or soul orother agent of combination), to treat the consciousness of the alphabet as a twenty-seventh fact, the substitute and notthe sum of the twenty-six simpler consciousness, and to say that while under certain physiological conditions theyalone are produced, other more complex physiological conditions result in its production instead. Do not talk,therefore, I said, of the higher states consisting of the simpler, or being the same with them; talk rather of theirknowing the same things. They are different mental facts, but they apprehend, each in its own peculiar way, the sameobjective A, B, C, and D.The theory of combination, I was forced to conclude, is"},{"pageNumber":762,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP715 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 17]Page 715thus untenable, being both logically nonsensical and practically unnecessary. Say what you will, twelve thoughts, eachof a single word, are not the self-same mental thing as one thought of the whole sentence. The higher thoughts, Iinsisted, are psychic units, not compounds; but for all that, they may know together as a collective multitude the verysame objects which under other conditions are known separately by as many simple thoughts.For many years I held rigorously to this view,1 and the reasons for doing so seemed to me during all those years toapply also to the opinion that the absolute mind stands to our minds in the relation of a whole to its parts. If untenablein finite psychology, that opinion ought to be untenable in metaphysics also. The great transcendentalist metaphor hasalways been, as I lately reminded you, a grammatical sentence. Physically such a sentence is of course composed ofclauses, these of words, the words of syllables, and the syllables of letters. We may take each word in, yet notunderstand the sentence; but if suddenly the meaning of the whole sentence flashes, the sense of each word is taken upinto that whole meaning. Just so, according to our transcendentalist teachers, the absolute mind thinks the wholesentence, while we, according to our rank as thinkers, think a clause, a word, a syllable, or a letter. Most of us are, asI said, mere syllables in the mouth of Allah. And as Allah comes first in the order of being, so comes first the entiresentence, the logos that forms the eternal absolute thought. Students of language tell us that speech began with men'sefforts to make statements. The rude synthetic vocal utterances first used for this effect slowly got stereotyped, andthen much later got decomposed into grammatical parts. It is not as if men had first invented letters and madesyllables of them, then made words of the syllables and sentences of the words;—they actually followed the reverse1I hold to it still as the best description of an enormous number of our higher fields of consciousness. They demonstrably do not containthe lower states that know the same objects. Of other fields, however, this is not so true; so, in the Psychological Review for 1895, vol. ii,p. 105 (see especially pp. 119 120), I frankly withdrew, in principle, my former objection to talking of fields of consciousness beingmade of simpler 'parts,' leaving the facts to decide the question in each special case."},{"pageNumber":763,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP716 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 18]Page 716order. So, the transcendentalists affirm, the complete absolute thought is the pre-condition of our thoughts, and wefinite creatures are only in so far as it owns us as its verbal fragments.The metaphor is so beautiful, and applies, moreover, so literally to such a multitude of the minor wholes ofexperience, that by merely hearing it most of us are convinced that it must apply universally. We see that no smallestraindrop can come into being without a whole shower, no single feather without a whole bird, neck and crop, beakand tail, coming into being simultaneously: so we unhesitatingly lay down the law that no part of anything can beexcept so far as the whole also is. And then, since everything whatever is part of the whole universe, and since (if weare idealists) nothing, whether part or whole, exists except for a witness, we proceed to the conclusion that theunmitigated absolute as witness of the whole is the one sole ground of being of every partial fact, the fact of our ownexistence included. We think of ourselves as being only a few of the feathers, so to speak, which help to constitutethat absolute bird. Extending the analogy of certain wholes, of which we have familiar experience, to the whole ofwholes, we easily become absolute idealists.But if, instead of yielding to the seductions of our metaphor, be it sentence, shower, or bird, we analyze morecarefully the notion suggested by it that we are constituent parts of the absolute's eternal field of consciousness, wefind grave difficulties arising. First, the difficulty I found with the mind-dust theory. If the absolute makes us byknowing us, how can we exist otherwise than as it knows us? But it knows each of us indivisibly from everythingelse. Yet if to exist means nothing but to be experienced, as idealism affirms, we surely exist otherwise, for weexperience ourselves ignorantly and in division. We indeed differ from the absolute not only by defect, but by excess.Our ignorances, for example, bring curiosities and doubts by which it cannot be troubled, for it owns eternally thesolution of every problem. Our impotence entails pains, our imperfection sins, which its perfection keeps at a distance.What I said of the alphabet-form and the letters holds good of the absolute experience and our experiences."},{"pageNumber":764,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP717 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 20]Page 717Their relation, whatever it may be, seems not to be that of identity.It is impossible to reconcile the peculiarities of our experience with our being only the absolute's mental objects. AGod, as distinguished from the absolute, creates things by projecting them beyond himself as so many substances,each endowed with perseity, as the scholastics call it. But objects of thought are not things per se. They are there onlyfor their thinker, and only as he thinks them. How, then, can they become severally alive on their own accounts andthink themselves quite otherwise than as he thinks them? It is as if the characters in a novel were to get up from thepages, and walk away and transact business of their own outside of the author's story.A third difficulty is this: The bird-metaphor is physical, but we see on reflection that in the physical world there is noreal compounding. 'Wholes' are not realities there, parts only are realities. 'Bird' is only our name for the physical factof a certain grouping of organs, just as 'Charles's Wain' is our name for a certain grouping of stars. The 'whole,' be itbird or constellation, is nothing but our vision, nothing but an effect on our sensorium when a lot of things act on ittogether. It is not realized by any organ or any star, or experienced apart from the consciousness of an onlooker.1 Inthe physical world taken by itself there is thus no 'all,' there are only the 'eaches'—at least that is the 'scientific' view.In the mental world, on the contrary, wholes do in point of fact realize themselves per se. The meaning of the wholesentence is just as much a real experience as the feeling of each word is; the absolute's experience is for itself, asmuch as yours is for yourself or mine for myself. So the feather-and-bird analogy won't work unless you make theabsolute into a distinct sort of mental agent with a vision produced in it by our several minds analogous to the 'bird'-vision which the feathers, beak, etc., produce in those same minds. The 'whole,' which is its experience, would then beits unifying reaction on our experiences, and not those very experiences1I abstract from the consciousness attached to the whole itself, if such consciousness be there."},{"pageNumber":765,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP718 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 21]Page 718self-combined. Such a view as this would go with theism, for the theistic God is a separate being; but it would not gowith pantheistic idealism, the very essence of which is to insist that we are literally parts of God, and he onlyourselves in our totality—the word 'ourselves' here standing of course for all the universe's finite facts.I am dragging you into depths unsuitable, I fear, for a rapid lecture. Such difficulties as these have to be teased outwith a needle, so to speak, and lecturers should take only bird's-eye views. The practical upshot of the matter,however, so far as I am concerned, is this, that if I had been lecturing on the absolute a very few years ago, I shouldunhesitatingly have urged these difficulties, and developed them at still greater length, to show that the hypothesis ofthe absolute was not only non-coercive from the logical point of view, but self-contradictory as well, its notion thatparts and whole are only two names for the same thing not bearing critical scrutiny. If you stick to purely physicalterms like stars, there is no whole. If you call the whole mental, then the so-called whole, instead of being one factwith the parts, appears rather as the integral reaction on those parts of an independent higher witness, such as thetheistic God is supposed to be.So long as this was the state of my own mind, I could accept the notion of self-compounding in the supernal spheresof experience no more easily than in that chapter on mind-dust I had accepted it in the lower spheres. I found myselfcompelled, therefore, to call the absolute impossible; and the untrammelled freedom with which pantheistic ormonistic idealists stepped over the logical barriers which Lotze and others had set down long before I had—I haddone little more than quote these previous critics in my chapter—surprised me not a little, and made me, I have toconfess, both resentful and envious. Envious because in the bottom of my heart I wanted the same freedom myself, formotives which I shall develop later; and resentful because my absolutist friends seemed to me to be stealing theprivilege of blowing both hot and cold. To establish their absolute they used an intellectualist type of logic which theydisregarded when employed against it. It seemed to me that they ought at least to have mentioned the objections thathad stopped"},{"pageNumber":766,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP719 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 33]Page 719me so completely. I had yielded to them against my 'will to believe,' out of pure logical scrupulosity. They, professingto loathe the will to believe and to follow purest rationality, had simply ignored them. The method was easy, buthardly to be called candid. Fechner indeed was candid enough, for he had never thought of the objections, but laterwriters, like Royce, who should presumably have heard them, had passed them by in silence. I felt as if thesephilosophers were granting their will to believe in monism too easy a license. My own conscience would permit meno such license.So much for the personal confession by which you have allowed me to introduce the subject. Let us now consider itmore objectively.The fundamental difficulty I have found is the number of contradictions which idealistic monists seem to disregard. Inthe first place they attribute to all existence a mental or experiential character, but I find their simultaneous belief thatthe higher and the lower in the universe are entitatively identical, incompatible with this character. Incompatible inconsequence of the generally accepted doctrine that, whether Berkeley were right or not in saying of materialexistence that its esse is sentiri, it is undoubtedly right to say of mental existence that its esse is sentiri or experiri. If Ifeel pain, it is just pain that I feel, however I may have come by the feeling. No one pretends that pain as such onlyappears like pain, but in itself is different, for to be as a mental experience is only to appear to some one.The idealists in question ought then to do one of two things, but they do neither. They ought either to refute the notionthat as mental states appear, so they are; or, still keeping that notion, they ought to admit a distinct agent of unificationto do the work of the all-knower, just as our respective souls or selves in popular philosophy do the work of partialknowers. Otherwise we have a joint-stock company all shareholders and no treasurer or manager. If our finite mindsformed a billion facts, then its mind, knowing our billion, would make a universe composed of a billion and one facts.But transcendental idealism is quite as unfriendly to active principles called souls as physiological psychology is,Kant having, as it thinks, definitively demolished them. And"},{"pageNumber":767,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP720 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 34]Page 720altho some disciples speak of the transcendental ego of apperception (which they celebrate as Kant's most preciouslegacy to posterity) as if it were a combining agent, the drift of monistic authority is certainly in the direction oftreating it as only an all-witness, whose field of vision we finite witnesses do not cause, but constitute rather. We arethe letters, it is the alphabet; we are the features, it is the face; not indeed as if either alphabet or face were somethingadditional to the letters or the features, but rather as if it were only another name for the very letters or featuresthemselves. The all-form assuredly differs from the each-form, but the matter is the same in both, and the each-formonly an unaccountable appearance.But this, as you see, contradicts the other idealist principle, of a mental fact being just what it appears to be. If theirforms of appearance are so different, the all and the eaches cannot be identical.The way out (unless, indeed, we are willing to discard the logic of identity altogether) would seem to be frankly towrite down the all and the eaches as two distinct orders of witness, each minor witness being aware of its own'content' solely, while the greater witness knows the minor witnesses, knows their whole content pooled together,knows their relations to one another, and knows of just how much each one of them is ignorant.The two types of witnessing are here palpably non-identical. We get a pluralism, not a monism, out of them. In mypsychology-chapter I had resorted openly to such pluralism, treating each total field of consciousness as a distinctentity, and maintaining that the higher fields merely supersede the lower functionally by knowing more about the sameobjects.The monists themselves writhe like worms on the hook to escape pluralistic or at least dualistic language, but theycannot escape it. They speak of the eternal and the temporal 'points of view'; of the universe in its infinite 'aspect' or inits finite 'capacity'; they say that 'quâ absolute' it is one thing, 'quâ relative' another; they contrast its 'truth' with its'appearances'; they distinguish the total from the partial way of 'taking' it, etc.; but they forget that, on idealisticprinciples, to make such distinctions is tantamount to making different beings, or at any rate that varying points ofview, aspects,"},{"pageNumber":768,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP721 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 35]Page 721appearances, ways of taking, and the like, are meaningless phrases unless we suppose outside of the unchangingcontent of reality a diversity of witnesses who experience or take it variously, the absolute mind being just the witnessthat takes it most completely.For consider the matter one moment longer, if you can. Ask what this notion implies, of appearing differently fromdifferent points of view. If there be no outside witness, a thing can appear only to itself, the eaches or parts to theirseveral selves temporally, the all or whole to itself eternally. Different 'selves' thus break out inside of what theabsolutist insists to be intrinsically one fact. But how can what is actually one be effectively so many? Put yourwitnesses anywhere, whether outside or inside of what is witnessed, in the last resort your witnesses must on idealisticprinciples be distinct, for what is witnessed is different.I fear that I am expressing myself with terrible obscurity—some of you, I know, are groaning over the logic-chopping.Be a pluralist or be a monist, you say, for heaven's sake, no matter which, so long as you stop arguing. It reminds oneof Chesterton's epigram that the only thing that ever drives human beings insane is logic. But whether I be sane orinsane, you cannot fail, even tho you be transcendentalists yourselves, to recognize to some degree by my trouble thedifficulties that beset monistic idealism. What boots it to call the parts and the whole the same body of experience,when in the same breath you have to say that the all 'as such' means one sort of experience and each part 'as such'means another?Difficulties, then, so far, but no stable solution as yet, for I have been talking only critically. You will probably berelieved to hear, then, that having rounded this corner, I shall begin to consider what may be the possibilities ofgetting farther.To clear the path, I beg you first to note one point. What has so troubled my logical conscience is not so much theabsolute by itself as the whole class of suppositions of which it is the supreme example, collective experiencesnamely, claiming identity with their constituent parts, yet experiencing things quite differently from these latter. If anysuch collective experience can be, then of course, so far as the mere logic of the case goes, the absolute may be. In aprevious lecture I"},{"pageNumber":769,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP722 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 37]Page 722have talked against the absolute from other points of view. In this lecture I have meant merely to take it as theexample most prominent at Oxford of the thing which has given me such logical perplexity. I don't logically see howa collective experience of any grade whatever can be treated as logically identical with a lot of distributiveexperiences. They form two different concepts. The absolute happens to be the only collective experience concerningwhich Oxford idealists have urged the identity, so I took it as my prerogative instance. But Fechner's earth-soul, orany stage of being below or above that, would have served my purpose just as well: the same logical objection appliesto these collective experiences as to the absolute.So much, then, in order that you may not be confused about my strategical objective. The real point to defend againstthe logic that I have used is the identity of the collective and distributive anyhow, not the particular example of suchidentity known as the absolute.So now for the directer question. Shall we say that every complex mental fact is a separate psychic entity succeedingupon a lot of other psychic entities which are erroneously called its parts, and superseding them in function, but notliterally being composed of them? This was the course I took in my psychology; and if followed in theology, weshould have to deny the absolute as usually conceived, and replace it by the 'God' of theism. We should also have todeny Fechner's 'earth-soul' and all other superhuman collections of experience of every grade, so far at least as theseare held to be compounded of our simpler souls in the way which Fechner believed in; and we should have to makeall these denials in the name of the incorruptible logic of self-identity, teaching us that to call a thing and its other thesame is to commit the crime of self-contradiction.But if we realize the whole philosophic situation thus produced, we see that it is almost intolerable. Loyal to thelogical kind of rationality, it is disloyal to every other kind. It makes the universe discontinuous. These fields ofexperience that replace each other so punctually, each knowing the same matter, but in ever-widening contexts, fromsimplest feeling up to absolute knowledge, can they have no being in common"},{"pageNumber":770,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP723 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 38]Page 723when their cognitive function is so manifestly common? The regular succession of them is on such terms anunintelligible miracle. If you reply that their common object is of itself enough to make the many witnessescontinuous, the same implacable logic follows you—how can one and the same object appear so variously? Its diverseappearances break it into a plurality; and our world of objects then falls into discontinuous pieces quite as much as didour world of subjects. The resultant irrationality is really intolerable.I said awhile ago that I was envious of Fechner and the other pantheists because I myself wanted the same freedomthat I saw them unscrupulously enjoying, of letting mental fields compound themselves and so make the universemore continuous, but that my conscience held me prisoner. In my heart of hearts, however, I knew that my situationwas absurd and could be only provisional. That secret of a continuous life which the universe knows by heart and actson every instant cannot be a contradiction incarnate. If logic says it is one, so much the worse for logic. Logic beingthe lesser thing, the static incomplete abstraction, must succumb to reality, not reality to logic. Our intelligence cannotwall itself up alive, like a pupa in its chrysalis. It must at any cost keep on speaking terms with the universe thatengendered it. Fechner, Royce, and Hegel seem on the truer path. Fechner has never heard of logic's veto, Royce hearsthe voice but cannily ignores the utterances, Hegel hears them but to spurn them—and all go on their way rejoicing.Shall we alone obey the veto?Sincerely, and patiently as I could, I struggled with the problem for years, covering hundreds of sheets of paper withnotes and memoranda and discussions with myself over the difficulty. How can many consciousnesses be at the sametime one consciousness? How can one and the same identical fact experience itself so diversely? The struggle wasvain; I found myself in an impasse. I saw that I must either forswear that 'psychology without a soul' to which mywhole psychological and kantian education had committed me,—I must, in short, bring back distinct spiritual agentsto know the mental states, now singly and now in combination, in a word bring back scholasticism and common sense—or else I must squarely"},{"pageNumber":771,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP724 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 39]Page 724confess the solution of the problem impossible, and then either give up my intellectualistic logic, the logic of identity,and adopt some higher (or lower) form of rationality, or, finally, face the fact that life is logically irrational.Sincerely, this is the actual trilemma that confronts every one of us. Those of you who are scholastic-minded, orsimply common-sense minded, will smile at the elaborate groans of my parturient mountain resulting in nothing butthis mouse. Accept the spiritual agents, for heaven's sake, you will say, and leave off your ridiculous pedantry. Let butour 'souls' combine our sensations by their intellectual faculties, and let but 'God' replace the pantheistic world-soul,and your wheels will go round again—you will enjoy both life and logic together.This solution is obvious and I know that many of you will adopt it. It is comfortable, and all our habits of speechsupport it. Yet it is not for idle or fantastical reasons that the notion of the substantial soul, so freely used by commonmen and the more popular philosophies, has fallen upon such evil days, and has no prestige in the eyes of criticalthinkers. It only shares the fate of other unrepresentable substances and principles. They are without exception all sobarren that to sincere inquirers they appear as little more than names masquerading—Wo die begriffe fehlen da stelltein wort zur rechten zeit sich ein. You see no deeper into the fact that a hundred sensations get compounded or knowntogether by thinking that a 'soul' does the compounding than you see into a man's living eighty years by calling him apredestined octogenarian, or into our having five fingers by calling us pentadactyls. Souls have worn out boththemselves and their welcome, that is the plain truth. Philosophy ought to get the manifolds of experience unified onprinciples less empty. Like the word 'cause,' the word 'soul' is but a theoretic stop-gap—it marks a place and claims itfor a future explanation to occupy.This being our post-humian and post-kantian state of mind, I will ask your permission to leave the soul wholly out ofthe present discussion and to consider only the residual dilemma. Some day, indeed, souls may get their innings againin philosophy—I am quite ready to admit that possibility—"},{"pageNumber":772,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP725 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 40]Page 725they form a category of thought too natural to the human mind to expire without prolonged resistance. But if the beliefin the soul ever does come to life after the many funeral-discourses which humian and kantian criticism havepreached over it, I am sure it will be only when some one has found in the term a pragmatic significance that hashitherto eluded observation. When that champion speaks, as he well may speak some day, it will be time to considersouls more seriously.Let us leave out the soul, then, and confront what I just called the residual dilemma. Can we, on the one hand, give upthe logic of identity?—can we, on the other, believe human experience to be fundamentally irrational? Neither is easy,yet it would seem that we must do one or the other.Few philosophers have had the frankness fairly to admit the necessity of choosing between the 'horns' offered. Realitymust be rational, they have said, and since the ordinary intellectualist logic is the only usual test of rationality, realityand logic must agree 'somehow.' Hegel was the first non-mystical writer to face the dilemma squarely and throw awaythe ordinary logic, saving a pseudo-rationality for the universe by inventing the higher logic of the 'dialectic process.'Bradley holds to the intellectualist logic, and by dint of it convicts the human universe of being irrationality incarnate.But what must be and can be, is, he says; there must and can be relief from that irrationality; and the absolute mustalready have got the relief in secret ways of its own, impossible for us to guess at. We of course get no relief, soBradley's is a rather ascetic doctrine. Royce and Taylor accept similar solutions, only they emphasize the irrationalityof our finite universe less than Bradley does; and Royce in particular, being unusually 'thick' for an idealist, tries tobring the absolute's secret forms of relief more sympathetically home to our imagination.Well, what must we do in this tragic predicament? For my own part, I have finally found myself compelled to give upthe logic, fairly, squarely, and irrevocably. It has an imperishable use in human life, but that use is not to make ustheoretically acquainted with the essential nature of reality—just what it is I can perhaps suggest to you a little later.Reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows andsurrounds it. If you like to"},{"pageNumber":773,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP726 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 42]Page 726employ words eulogistically, as most men do, and so encourage confusion, you may say that reality obeys a higherlogic, or enjoys a higher rationality. But I think that even eulogistic words should be used rather to distinguish than tocommingle meanings, so I prefer bluntly to call reality if not irrational then at least non-rational in its constitution,—and by reality here I mean reality where things happen, all temporal reality without exception. I myself find no goodwarrant for even suspecting the existence of any reality of a higher denomination than that distributed and strung-along and flowing sort of reality which we finite beings swim in. That is the sort of reality given us, and that is thesort with which logic is so incommensurable. If there be any higher sort of reality—the 'absolute,' for example—thatsort, by the confession of those who believe in it, is still less amenable to ordinary logic; it transcends logic and istherefore still less rational in the intellectualist sense, so it cannot help us to save our logic as an adequate definer andconfiner of existence.These sayings will sound queer and dark, probably they will sound quite wild or childish in the absence of explanatorycomment. Only the persuasion that I soon can explain them, if not satisfactorily to all of you, at least intelligibly,emboldens me to state them thus baldly as a sort of programme. Please take them as a thesis, therefore, to be defendedby later pleading.I told you that I had long and sincerely wrestled with the dilemma. I have now to confess (and this will probablyreanimate your interest) that I should not now be emancipated, not now subordinate logic with so very light a heart, orthrow it out of the deeper regions of philosophy to take its rightful and respectable place in the world of simple humanpractice, if I had not been influenced by a comparatively young and very original french writer, Professor HenriBergson. Reading his works is what has made me bold. If I had not read Bergson, I should probably still beblackening endless pages of paper privately, in the hope of making ends meet that were never meant to meet, andtrying to discover some mode of conceiving the behavior of reality which should leave no discrepancy between it andthe accepted laws of the logic of identity. It is certain, at any rate, that without the confi-"},{"pageNumber":774,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP727 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 43]Page 727dence which being able to lean on Bergson's authority gives me I should never have ventured to urge these particularviews of mine upon this ultra-critical audience.I must therefore, in order to make my own views more intelligible, give some preliminary account of the bergsonianphilosophy. But here, as in Fechner's case, I must confine myself only to the features that are essential to the presentpurpose, and not entangle you in collateral details, however interesting otherwise. For our present purpose, then, theessential contribution of Bergson to philosophy is his criticism of intellectualism. In my opinion he has killedintellectualism definitively and without hope of recovery. I don't see how it can ever revive again in its ancientplatonizing rôle of claiming to be the most authentic, intimate, and exhaustive definer of the nature of reality. Others,as Kant for example, have denied intellectualism's pretensions to define reality an sich or in its absolute capacity; butKant still leaves it laying down laws—and laws from which there is no appeal—to all our human experience; whilewhat Bergson denies is that its methods give any adequate account of this human experience in its very finiteness. Justhow Bergson accomplishes all this I must try to tell in my imperfect way in the next lecture; but since I have alreadyused the words 'logic,' 'logic of identity,' 'intellectualistic logic,' and 'intellectualism' so often, and sometimes usedthem as if they required no particular explanation, it will be wise at this point to say at greater length than heretoforein what sense I take these terms when I claim that Bergson has refuted their pretension to decide what reality can orcannot be. Just what I mean by intellectualism is therefore what I shall try to give a fuller idea of during the remainderof this present hour.In recent controversies some participants have shown resentment at being classed as intellectualists. I mean to use theword disparagingly, but shall be sorry if it works offence. Intellectualism has its source in the faculty which gives usour chief superiority to the brutes, our power, namely, of translating the crude flux of our merely feeling-experienceinto a conceptual order. An immediate experience, as yet unnamed or classed, is a mere that that we undergo, a thingthat asks, 'What am I?' When we name and class it, we say for the first"},{"pageNumber":775,"pageContent":"fil ///E|/T/MM3/ illi%20j/P728 h l[01 03 2011 01 45 43]Page 728time what it is, and all these whats are abstract names or concepts. Each concept means a particular kind ofthing, and as things seem once for all to have been created in kinds, a far more efficient handling of a given bitof experience begins as soon as we have classed the various parts of it. Once classed, a thing can be treated bythe law of its class, and the advantages are endless. Both theoretically and practically this power of framingabstract concepts is one of the sublimest of our human prerogatives. We come back into the concrete from ourjourney into these abstractions, with an increase both of vision and of power. It is no wonder that earlierthinkers, forgetting that concepts are only man-made extracts from the temporal flux, should have ended bytreating them as a superior type of being, bright, changeless, true, divine, and utterly opposed in nature to theturbid, restless lower world. The latter then appears as but their corruption and falsification.Intellectualism in the vicious sense began when Socrates and Plato taught that what a thing really is, is told usby its definition. Ever since Socrates we have been taught that reality consists of essences, not of appearances,and that the essences of things are known whenever we know their definitions. So first we identify the thingwith a concept and then we identify the concept with a definition, and only then, inasmuch as the thing iswhatever the definition expresses, are we sure of apprehending the real essence of it or the full truth about it.So far no harm is done. The misuse of concepts begins with the habit of employing them privatively as well aspositively, using them not merely to assign properties to things, but to deny the very properties with which thethings sensibly present themselves. Logic can extract all its possible consequences from any definition, and thelogician who is unerbittlich consequent is often tempted, when he cannot extract a certain property from adefinition, to deny that the concrete object to which the definition applies can possibly possess that property.The definition that fails to yield it must exclude or negate it. This is Hegel's regular method of establishing hissystem.It is but the old story, of a useful practice first becoming a method, then a habit, and finally a tyranny thatdefeats the"},{"pageNumber":776,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP729 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 44]Page 729end it was used for. Concepts, first employed to make things intelligible, are clung to even when they make themunintelligible. Thus it comes that when once you have conceived things as 'independent,' you must proceed to deny thepossibility of any connexion whatever among them, because the notion of connexion is not contained in the definitionof independence. For a like reason you must deny any possible forms or modes of unity among things which you havebegun by defining as a 'many.' We have cast a glance at Hegel's and Bradley's use of this sort of reasoning, and youwill remember Sigwart's epigram that according to it a horseman can never in his life go on foot, or a photographerever wash his hands, or do anything but photograph.The classic extreme in this direction is the denial of the possibility of change, and the consequent branding of theworld of change as unreal, by certain philosophers. The definition of A is changeless, so is the definition of B. Theone definition cannot change into the other, so the notion that a concrete thing A should change into another concretething B is made out to be contrary to reason. In Mr. Bradley's difficulty in seeing how sugar can be sweetintellectualism outstrips itself and becomes openly a sort of verbalism. Sugar is just sugar and sweet is just sweet;neither is the other; nor can the word 'is' ever be understood to join any subject to its predicate rationally. Nothing'between' things can connect them, for 'between' is just that third thing, 'between,' and would need itself to beconnected to the first and second things by two still finer betweens, and so on ad infinitum.The particular intellectualistic difficulty that had held my own thought so long in a vise was, as we have seen at suchtedious length, the impossibility of understanding how 'your' experience and 'mine,' which 'as such' are defined as notconscious of each other, can nevertheless at the same time be members of a world-experience defined expressly ashaving all its parts co-conscious, or known together. The definitions are contradictory, so the things defined can in noway be united. You see how unintelligible intellectualism here seems to make the world of our most accomplishedphilosophers. Neither as they use it nor as we use it does it do anything but make nature look irrational and seemimpossible."},{"pageNumber":777,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP730 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 45]Page 730In my next lecture, using Bergson as my principal topic, I shall enter into more concrete details and try, by giving upintellectualism frankly, to make, if not the world, at least my own general thesis, less unintelligible."},{"pageNumber":778,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP731 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 46]Page 731Lecture VIBergson and his Critique of IntellectualismI gave you a very stiff lecture last time, and I fear that this one can be little less so. The best way of entering into itwill be to begin immediately with Bergson's philosophy, since I told you that that was what had led me personally torenounce the intellectualistic method and the current notion that logic is an adequate measure of what can or cannotbe.Professor Henri Bergson is a young man, comparatively, as influential philosophers go, having been born at Paris in1859. His career has been the perfectly routine one of a successful french professor. Entering the école normalesupérieure at the age of twenty-two, he spent the next seventeen years teaching at lycées, provincial or parisian, untilhis fortieth year, when he was made professor at the said école normale. Since 1900 he has been professor at theCollège de France, and member of the Institute since 1900.So far as the outward facts go, Bergson's career has then been commonplace to the utmost. Neither one of Taine'sfamous principles of explanation of great men, the race, the environment, or the moment, no, nor all three together,will explain that peculiar way of looking at things that constitutes his mental individuality. Originality in men datesfrom nothing previous, other things date from it, rather. I have to confess that Bergson's originality is so profuse thatmany of his ideas baffle me entirely. I doubt whether any one understands him all over, so to speak; and I am sure thathe would himself be the first to see that this must be, and to confess that things which he himself has not yet thoughtout clearly, had yet to be mentioned and have a tentative place assigned them in his philosophy. Many of us areprofusely original, in that no man can understand us—violently peculiar ways of looking at things are no great rarity.The rarity is when great peculiarity of vision is allied with great lucidity and unusual command of all the classicexpository apparatus. Bergson's resources in the way of erudition are remarkable, and in the way of expression theyare simply phenomenal. This is why in France,"},{"pageNumber":779,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP732 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 53]Page 732where Part de bien dire counts for so much and is so sure of appreciation, he has immediately taken so eminent aplace in public esteem. Old-fashioned professors, whom his ideas quite fail to satisfy, nevertheless speak of his talentalmost with bated breath, while the youngsters flock to him as to a master.If anything can make hard things easy to follow, it is a style like Bergson's. A 'straightforward' style, an americanreviewer lately called it; failing to see that such straightforwardness means a flexibility of verbal resource that followsthe thought without a crease or wrinkle, as elastic silk underclothing follows the movements of one's body. Thelucidity of Bergson's way of putting things is what all readers are first struck by. It seduces you and bribes you inadvance to become his disciple. It is a miracle, and he a real magician.M. Bergson, if I am rightly informed, came into philosophy through the gateway of mathematics. The old antinomiesof the infinite were, I imagine, the irritant that first woke his faculties from their dogmatic slumber. You all rememberZeno's famous paradox, or sophism, as many of our logic books still call it, of Achilles and the tortoise. Give thatreptile ever so small an advance and the swift runner Achilles can never overtake him, much less get ahead of him; forif space and time are infinitely divisible (as our intellects tell us they must be), by the time Achilles reaches thetortoise's starting point, the tortoise has already got ahead of that startingpoint, and so on ad infinitum, the intervalbetween the pursuer and the pursued growing endlessly minuter, but never becoming wholly obliterated. The commonway of showing up the sophism here is by pointing out the ambiguity of the expression 'never can overtake.' What theword 'never' falsely suggests, it is said, is an infinite duration of time; what it really means is the inexhaustible numberof the steps of which the overtaking must consist. But if these steps are infinitely short, a finite time will suffice forthem; and in point of fact they do rapidly converge, whatever be the original interval or the contrasted speeds, towardinfinitesimal shortness. This proportionality of the shortness of the times to that of the spaces required frees us, it isclaimed, from the sophism which the word 'never' suggests."},{"pageNumber":780,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP733 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 54]Page 733But this criticism misses Zeno's point entirely. Zeno would have been perfectly willing to grant that if the tortoise canbe overtaken at all, he can be overtaken in (say) twenty seconds, but he would still have insisted that he can't beovertaken at all. Leave Achilles and the tortoise out of the account altogether, he would have said—they complicatethe case unnecessarily. Take any single process of change whatever, take the twenty seconds themselves elapsing. Iftime be infinitely divisible, and it must be so on intellectualist principles, they simply cannot elapse, their end cannotbe reached; for no matter how much of them has already elapsed, before the remainder, however minute, can havewholly elapsed, the earlier half of it must first have elapsed. And this ever rearising need of making the earlier halfelapse first leaves time with always something to do before the last thing is done, so that the last thing never getsdone. Expressed in bare numbers, it is like the convergent series ½ plus ¼ plus 1/8 , of which the limit is one. Butthis limit, simply because it is a limit, stands outside the series, the value of which approaches it indefinitely but nevertouches it. If in the natural world there were no other way of getting things save by such successive addition of theirlogically involved fractions, no complete units or whole things would ever come into being, for the fractions' sumwould always leave a remainder. But in point of fact nature doesn't make eggs by making first half an egg, then aquarter, then an eighth, etc., and adding them together. She either makes a whole egg at once or none at all, and so ofall her other units. It is only in the sphere of change, then, where one phase of a thing must needs come into beingbefore another phase can come that Zeno's paradox gives trouble.And it gives trouble then only if the succession of steps of change be infinitely divisible. If a bottle had to be emptiedby an infinite number of successive decrements, it is mathematically impossible that the emptying should everpositively terminate. In point of fact, however, bottles and coffee-pots empty themselves by a finite number ofdecrements, each of definite amount. Either a whole drop emerges or nothing emerges from the spout. If all changewent thus drop-wise, so to speak, if real time sprouted or grew by units of duration"},{"pageNumber":781,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP734 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 55]Page 734of determinate amount, just as our perceptions of it grow by pulses, there would be no zenonian paradoxes or kantianantinomies to trouble us. All our sensible experiences, as we get them immediately, do thus change by discrete pulsesof perception, each of which keeps us saying 'more, more, more,' or 'less, less, less,' as the definite increments ordiminutions make themselves felt. The discreteness is still more obvious when, instead of old things changing, theycease, or when altogether new things come. Fechner's term of the 'threshold,' which has played such a part in thepsychology of perception, is only one way of naming the quantitative discreteness in the change of all our sensibleexperiences. They come to us in drops. Time itself comes in drops.Our ideal decomposition of the drops which are all that we feel into still finer fractions is but an incident in that greattransformation of the perceptual order into a conceptual order of which I spoke in my last lecture. It is made in theinterest of our rationalizing intellect solely. The times directly felt in the experiences of living subjects have originallyno common measure. Let a lump of sugar melt in a glass, to use one of M. Bergson's instances. We feel the time to belong while waiting for the process to end, but who knows how long or how short it feels to the sugar? All felt timescoexist and overlap or compenetrate each other thus vaguely, but the artifice of plotting them on a common scale helpsus to reduce their aboriginal confusion, and it helps us still more to plot, against the same scale, the successivepossible steps into which nature's various changes may be resolved, either sensibly or conceivably. We thus straightenout the aboriginal privacy and vagueness, and can date things publicly, as it were, and by each other. The notion ofone objective and 'evenly flowing' time, cut into numbered instants, applies itself as a common measure to all the stepsand phases, no matter how many, into which we cut the processes of nature. They are now definitely contemporary, orlater or earlier one than another, and we can handle them mathematically, as we say, and far better, practically as wellas theoretically, for having thus correlated them one to one with each other on the common schematic or conceptualtime-scale.Motion, to take a good example, is originally a turbid"},{"pageNumber":782,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP735 hl[01 03 2011 01 45 57]Page 735sensation, of which the native shape is perhaps best preserved in the phenomenon of vertigo. In vertigo we feel thatmovement is, and is more or less violent or rapid, more or less in this direction or that, more or less alarming orsickening. But a man subject to vertigo may gradually learn to co-ordinate his felt motion with his real position andthat of other things, and intellectualize it enough to succeed at last in walking without staggering. The mathematicalmind similarly organizes motion in its way, putting it into a logical definition: motion is now conceived as 'theoccupancy of serially successive points of space at serially successive instants of time.' With such a definition weescape wholly from the turbid privacy of sense. But do we not also escape from sense-reality altogether? Whatevermotion really may be, it surely is not static; but the definition we have gained is of the absolutely static. It gives a setof one-to-one relations between spacepoints and time-points, which relations themselves are as fixed as the pointsare. It gives positions assignable ad infinitum, but how the body gets from one position to another it omits to mention.The body gets there by moving, of course; but the conceived positions, however numerously multiplied, contain noelement of movement, so Zeno, using nothing but them in his discussion, has no alternative but to say that our intellectrepudiates motion as a non-reality. Intellectualism here does what I said it does—it makes experience less instead ofmore intelligible.We of course need a stable scheme of concepts, stably related with one another, to lay hold of our experiences and toco-ordinate them withal. When an experience comes with sufficient saliency to stand out, we keep the thought of it forfuture use, and store it in our conceptual system. What does not of itself stand out, we learn to cut out; so the systemgrows completer, and new reality, as it comes, gets named after and conceptually strung upon this or that element of itwhich we have already established. The immutability of such an abstract system is its great practical merit; the sameidentical terms and relations in it can always be recovered and referred to—change itself is just such an unalterableconcept. But all these abstract concepts are but as flowers gathered, they are only moments dipped out from the streamof time,"},{"pageNumber":783,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP736 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 09]Page 736snap-shots taken, as by a kinetoscopic camera, at a life that in its original coming is continuous. Useful as they are assamples of the garden, or to re-enter the stream with, or to insert in our revolving lantern, they have no value but thesepractical values. You cannot explain by them what makes any single phenomenon be or go—you merely dot out thepath of appearances which it traverses. For you cannot make continuous being out of discontinuities, and yourconcepts are discontinuous. The stages into which you analyze a change are states, the change itself goes on betweenthem. It lies along their intervals, inhabits what your definition fails to gather up, and thus eludes conceptualexplanation altogether.'When the mathematician,' Bergson writes, 'calculates the state of a system at the end of a time t, nothing need preventhim from supposing that betweenwhiles the universe vanishes, in order suddenly to appear again at the due moment inthe new configuration. It is only the t-th moment that counts—that which flows throughout the intervals, namely realtime, plays no part in his calculation. In short, the world on which the mathematician operates is a world which diesand is born anew at every instant, like the world which Descartes thought of when he spoke of a continued creation.'To know adequately what really happens we ought, Bergson insists, to see into the intervals, but the mathematiciansees only their extremities. He fixes only a few results, he dots a curve and then interpolates, he substitutes a tracingfor a reality.This being so undeniably the case, the history of the way in which philosophy has dealt with it is curious. The rulingtradition in philosophy has always been the platonic and aristotelian belief that fixity is a nobler and worthier thingthan change. Reality must be one and unalterable. Concepts, being themselves fixities, agree best with this fixednature of truth, so that for any knowledge of ours to be quite true it must be knowledge by universal concepts ratherthan by particular experiences, for these notoriously are mutable and corruptible. This is the tradition known asrationalism in philosophy, and what I have called intellectualism is only the extreme application of it. In spite ofsceptics and empiricists, in spite of Protagoras, Hume, and James Mill, rationalism has never been seriouslyquestioned, for its sharpest critics have always had a"},{"pageNumber":784,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP737 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 11]Page 737tender place in their hearts for it, and have obeyed some of its mandates. They have not been consistent; they haveplayed fast and loose with the enemy; and Bergson alone has been radical.To show what I mean by this, let me contrast his procedure with that of some of the transcendentalist philosopherswhom I have lately mentioned. Coming after Kant, these pique themselves on being 'critical,' on building in fact uponKant's 'critique' of pure reason. What that critique professed to establish was this, that concepts do not apprehendreality, but only such appearances as our senses feed out to them. They give immutable intellectual forms to theseappearances, it is true, but the reality an sich from which in ultimate resort the sense-appearances have to comeremains forever unintelligible to our intellect. Take motion, for example. Sensibly, motion comes in drops, waves, orpulses; either some actual amount of it, or none, being apprehended. This amount is the datum or gabe which realityfeeds out to our intellectual faculty; but our intellect makes of it a task or aufgabe—this pun is one of the mostmemorable of Kant's formulas—and insists that in every pulse of it an infinite number of successive minor pulsesshall be ascertainable. These minor pulses we can indeed go on to ascertain or to compute indefinitely if we havepatience; but it would contradict the definition of an infinite number to suppose the endless series of them to haveactually counted themselves out piecemeal. Zeno made this manifest; so the infinity which our intellect requires of thesense-datum is thus a future and potential rather than a past and actual infinity of structure. The datum after it hasmade itself must be decomposable ad infinitum by our conception, but of the steps by which that structure actually gotcomposed we know nothing. Our intellect casts, in short, no ray of light on the processes by which experiences getmade.Kant's monistic successors have in general found the data of immediate experience even more self-contradictory,when intellectually treated, than Kant did. Not only the character of infinity involved in the relation of variousempirical data to their 'conditions,' but the very notion that empirical things should be related to one another at all, hasseemed to them, when the intellectualistic fit was upon them, full of paradox"},{"pageNumber":785,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP738 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 13]Page 738and contradiction. We saw in a former lecture numerous instances of this from Hegel, Bradley, Royce, and others. Wesaw also where the solution of such an intolerable state of things was sought for by these authors. Whereas Kant hadplaced it outside of and before our experience, in the dinge an sich which are the causes of the latter, his monisticsuccessors all look for it either after experience, as its absolute completion, or else consider it to be even now implicitwithin experience as its ideal signification. Kant and his successors look, in short, in diametrically opposite directions.Do not be misled by Kant's admission of theism into his system. His God is the ordinary dualistic God of Christianity,to whom his philosophy simply opens the door; he has nothing whatsoever in common with the 'absolute spirit' set upby his successors. So far as this absolute spirit is logically derived from Kant, it is not from his God, but from entirelydifferent elements of his philosophy. First from his notion that an unconditioned totality of the conditions of anyexperience must be assignable; and then from his other notion that the presence of some witness, or ego ofapperception, is the most universal of all the conditions in question. The post-kantians make of the witness-conditionwhat is called a concrete universal, an individualized all-witness or world-self, which shall imply in its rationalconstitution each and all of the other conditions put together, and therefore necessitate each and all of the conditionedexperiences.Abridgments like this of other men's opinions are very unsatisfactory, they always work injustice; but in this casethose of you who are familiar with the literature will see immediately what I have in mind; and to the others, if therebe any here, it will suffice to say that what I am trying so pedantically to point out is only the fact that monisticidealists after Kant have invariably sought relief from the supposed contradictions of our world of sense by lookingforward toward an ens rationis conceived as its integration or logical completion, while he looked backward towardnon-rational dinge an sich conceived as its cause. Pluralistic empiricists, on the other hand, have remained in theworld of sense, either naïvely and because they overlooked the intellectualistic contradictions, or because, not able toignore them, they thought they could"},{"pageNumber":786,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP739 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 16]Page 739refute them by a superior use of the same intellectualistic logic. Thus it is that John Mill pretends to refute theAchillestortoise fallacy.The important point to notice here is the intellectualist logic. Both sides treat it as authoritative, but they do socapriciously: the absolutists smashing the world of sense by its means, the empiricists smashing the absolute—for theabsolute, they say, is the quintessence of all logical contradictions. Neither side attains consistency. The Hegelianshave to invoke a higher logic to supersede the purely destructive efforts of their first logic. The empiricists use theirlogic against the absolute, but refuse to use it against finite experience. Each party uses it or drops it to suit the visionit has faith in, but neither impugns in principle its general theoretic authority.Bergson alone challenges its theoretic authority in principle. He alone denies that mere conceptual logic can tell uswhat is impossible or possible in the world of being or fact; and he does so for reasons which at the same time thatthey rule logic out from lordship over the whole of life, establish a vast and definite sphere of influence where itssovereignty is indisputable. Bergson's own text, felicitous as it is, is too intricate for quotation, so I must use my owninferior words in explaining what I mean by saying this.In the first place, logic, giving primarily the relations between concepts as such, and the relations between naturalfacts only secondarily or so far as the facts have been already identified with concepts and defined by them, must ofcourse stand or fall with the conceptual method. But the conceptual method is a transformation which the flux of lifeundergoes at our hands in the interests of practice essentially and only subordinately in the interests of theory. We liveforward, we understand backward, said a danish writer; and to understand life by concepts is to arrest its movement,cutting it up into bits as if with scissors, and immobilizing these in our logical herbarium where, comparing them asdried specimens, we can ascertain which of them statically includes or excludes which other. This treatment supposeslife to have already accomplished itself, for the concepts, being so many views taken after the fact, are retrospectiveand post mortem. Nevertheless we can draw conclusions from them and project them into"},{"pageNumber":787,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP740 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 18]Page 740the future. We cannot learn from them how life made itself go, or how it will make itself go; but, on the suppositionthat its ways of making itself go are unchanging, we can calculate what positions of imagined arrest it will exhibithereafter under given conditions. We can compute, for instance, at what point Achilles will be, and where the tortoisewill be, at the end of the twentieth minute. Achilles may then be at a point far ahead; but the full detail of how he willhave managed practically to get there our logic never gives us—we have seen, indeed, that it finds that its resultscontradict the facts of nature. The computations which the other sciences make differ in no respect from those ofmathematics. The concepts used are all of them dots through which, by interpolation or extrapolation, curves aredrawn, while along the curves other dots are found as consequences. The latest refinements of logic dispense with thecurves altogether, and deal solely with the dots and their correspondences each to each in various series. The authorsof these recent improvements tell us expressly that their aim is to abolish the last vestiges of intuition, videlicet ofconcrete reality, from the field of reasoning, which then will operate literally on mental dots or bare abstract units ofdiscourse, and on the ways in which they may be strung in naked series.This is all very esoteric, and my own understanding of it is most likely misunderstanding. So I speak here only by wayof brief reminder to those who know. For the rest of us it is enough to recognize this fact, that altho by means ofconcepts cut out from the sensible flux of the past, we can re-descend upon the future flux and, making another cut,say what particular thing is likely to be found there; and that altho in this sense concepts give us knowledge, and maybe said to have some theoretic value (especially when the particular thing foretold is one in which we take no presentpractical interest); yet in the deeper sense of giving insight they have no theoretic value, for they quite fail to connectus with the inner life of the flux, or with the causes that govern its direction. Instead of being interpreters of reality,concepts negate the inwardness of reality altogether. They make the whole notion of a causal influence between finitethings incomprehensible.

The work begun by Zeno, and continued by Hume, Kant, Herbart, Hegel, and Bradley, doesnot stop till sensible reality lies entirely disintegrated at the feet of 'reason.'Of the 'absolute' reality which reason proposes to substitute for sensible reality I shall have more to say presently.Meanwhile you see what Professor Bergson means by insisting that the function of the intellect is practical rather thantheoretical. Sensible reality is too concrete to be entirely manageable—look at the narrow range of it which is all thatany animal, living in it exclusively as he does, is able to compass. To get from one point in it to another we have toplough or wade through the whole intolerable interval. No detail is spared us; it is as bad as the barbed-wirecomplications at Port Arthur, and we grow old and die in the process. But with our faculty of abstracting and fixingconcepts we are there in a second, almost as if we controlled a fourth dimension, skipping the intermediaries as by adivine winged power, and getting at the exact point we require without entanglement with any context. What we do infact is to harness up reality in our conceptual systems in order to drive it the better. This process is practical becauseall the termini to which we drive are particular termini, even when they are facts of the mental order. But the sciencesin which the conceptual method chiefly celebrates its triumphs are those of space and matter, where thetransformations of external things are dealt with. To deal with moral facts conceptually, we have first to transformthem, substitute brain-diagrams or physical metaphors, treat ideas as atoms, interests as mechanical forces, ourconscious 'selves' as 'streams,' and the like. Paradoxical effect! as Bergson well remarks, if our intellectual life werenot practical but destined to reveal the inner natures. One would then suppose that it would find itself most at home inthe domain of its own intellectual realities. But it is precisely there that it finds itself at the end of its tether. We knowthe inner movements of our spirit only perceptually. We feel them live in us, but can give no distinct account of theirelements, nor definitely predict their future; while things that lie along the world of space,"},{"pageNumber":789,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP742 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 21]Page 742things of the sort that we literally handle, are what our intellects cope with most successfully. Does not this confirmus in the view that the original and still surviving function of our intellectual life is to guide us in the practicaladaptation of our expectancies and activities?One can easily get into a verbal mess at this point, and my own experience with 'pragmatism' makes me shrink fromthe dangers that lie in the word 'practical'; so, far rather than stand out against you for that word, I am quite willing topart company with Professor Bergson, and to ascribe a primarily theoretical function to our intellect, provided you onyour part then agree to discriminate 'theoretic' or scientific knowledge from the deeper 'speculative' knowledge aspiredto by most philosophers, and concede that theoretic knowledge, which is knowledge about things, as distinguishedfrom living or sympathetic acquaintance with them, touches only the outer surface of reality.1 The surface whichtheoretic knowl-1For a more explicit vindication of the notion of activity, see Appendix B, where I try to defend its recognition as a definite form ofimmediate experience against its rationalistic critics.I subjoin here a few remarks destined to disarm some possible critics of Professor Bergson, who, to defend himself againstmisunderstandings of his meaning, ought to amplify and more fully explain his statement that concepts have a practical but not a theoreticaluse. Understood in one way, the thesis sounds indefensible, for by concepts we certainly increase our knowledge about things, and that seemsa theoretical achievement, whatever practical achievements may follow in its train. Indeed, M. Bergson might seem to be easily refutable outof his own mouth. His philosophy pretends, if anything, to give a better insight into truth than rationalistic philosophies give: yet what is it initself if not a conceptual system? Does its author not reason by concepts exclusively in his very attempt to show that they can give noinsight?To this particular objection, at any rate, it is easy to reply. In using concepts of his own to discredit the theoretic claims of concepts generally,Bergson does not contradict, but on the contrary emphatically illustrates his own view of their practical side, for they serve in his hands onlyto 'orient' us, to show us to what quarter we must practically turn if we wish to gain that completer insight into reality which he denies thatthey can give. He directs our hopes away from them and towards the despised sensible flux. What he reaches by their means is thus only anew practical attitude. He but restores, against the vetoes of intellectualist philosophy, our naturally cordial relations with sensible experienceand common sense. This service is surely only practical; but it is a service for which we may be almost immeasurably grateful. To trust oursenses again with a good philosophic conscience!—who ever conferred on us so valuable a freedom before?(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":790,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP743 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 29]Page 743edge taken in this sense covers may indeed be enormous in extent; it may dot the whole diameter of space and timewith its conceptual creations; but it does not penetrate a millimeter(Footnote continued from previous page)By making certain distinctions and additions it seems easy to meet the other counts of the indictment. Concepts are realities of a neworder, with particular relations between them. These relations are just as much directly perceived, when we compare our variousconcepts, as the distance between two sense-objects is perceived when we look at it. Conception is an operation which gives us materialfor new acts of perception, then; and when the results of these are written down, we get those bodies of 'mental truth' (as Locke called it)known as mathematics, logic, and a priori metaphysics. To know all this truth is a theoretic achievement, indeed, but it is a narrow one;for the relations between conceptual objects as such are only the static ones of bare comparison, as difference or sameness, congruity orcontradiction, inclusion or exclusion. Nothing happens in the realm of concepts; relations there are 'eternal' only. The theoretic gain failsso far, therefore, to touch even the outer hem of the real world, the world of causal and dynamic relations, of activity and history. To gaininsight into all that moving life, Bergson is right in turning us away from conception and towards perception.By combining concepts with percepts, we can draw maps of the distribution of other percepts in distant space and time. To know thisdistribution is of course a theoretic achievement, but the achievement is extremely limited, it cannot be effected without percepts, and eventhen what it yields is only static relations. From maps we learn positions only, and the position of a thing is but the slightest kind of truthabout it; but, being indispensable for forming our plans of action, the conceptual map-making has the enormous practical importance onwhich Bergson so rightly insists.But concepts, it will be said, do not only give us eternal truths of comparison and maps of the positions of things, they bring new values intolife. In their mapping function they stand to perception in general in the same relation in which sight and hearing stand to touch—Spencercalls these higher senses only organs of anticipatory touch. But our eyes and ears also open to us worlds of independent glory: music anddecorative art result, and an incredible enhancement of life's value follows. Even so does the conceptual world bring new ranges of value andof motivation to our life. Its maps not only serve us practically, but the mere mental possession of such vast pictures is of itself an inspiringgood. New interests and incitements, and feelings of power, sublimity, and admiration are aroused.Abstractness per se seems to have a touch of ideality. ROYCE's 'loyalty to loyalty' is an excellent example. 'Causes,' as anti-slavery,democracy, liberty, etc., dwindle when realized in their sordid particulars. The veritable 'cash-value' of the idea seems to cleave to it only inthe abstract status. Truth at large, as ROYCE contends, in his Philosophy of Loyalty, appears another thing altogether from the true particularsin which it is best to believe. It transcends in value all those 'expediencies,' and is something to live for, whether(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":791,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP744 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 31]Page 744into the solid dimension. That inner dimension of reality is occupied by the activities that keep it going, but theintellect, speaking through Hume, Kant & Co., finds itself obliged to(Footnote continued from previous page)expedient or inexpedient. Truth with a big T is a 'momentous issue'; truths in detail are 'poor scraps,' mere 'crumbling successes.' (Op.cit., Lecture VII, especially § v.)Is, now, such bringing into existence of a new value to be regarded as a theoretic achievement? The question is a nice one, for altho a valueis in one sense an objective quality perceived, the essence of that quality is its relation to the will, and consists in its being a dynamogenicspur that makes our action different. So far as their value-creating function goes, it would thus appear that concepts connect themselves morewith our active than with our theoretic life, so here again Bergson's formulation seems unobjectionable. Persons who have certain conceptsare animated otherwise, pursue their own vital careers differently. It does n't necessarily follow that they understand other vital careers moreintimately.Again it may be said that we combine old concepts into new ones, conceiving thus such realities as the ether, God, souls, or what not, ofwhich our sensible life alone would leave us altogether ignorant. This surely is an increase of our knowledge, and may well be called atheoretical achievement. Yet here again Bergson's criticisms hold good. Much as conception may tell us about such invisible objects, it shedsno ray of light into their interior. The completer, indeed, our definitions of ether-waves, atoms, Gods, or souls become, the less instead of themore intelligible do they appear to us. The learned in such things are consequently beginning more and more to ascribe a solely instrumentalvalue to our concepts of them. Ether and molecules may be like co-ordinates and averages, only so many crutches by the help of which wepractically perform the operation of getting about among our sensible experiences.We see from these considerations how easily the question of whether the function of concepts is theoretical or practical may grow into alogomachy. It may be better from this point of view to refuse to recognize the alternative as a sharp one. The sole thing that is certain in themidst of it all is that Bergson is absolutely right in contending that the whole life of activity and change is inwardly impenetrable toconceptual treatment, and that it opens itself only to sympathetic apprehension at the hands of immediate feeling. All the whats as well as thethats of reality, relational as well as terminal, are in the end contents of immediate concrete perception. Yet the remoter unperceivedarrangements, temporal, spatial, and logical, of these contents, are also something that we need to know as well for the pleasure of theknowing as for the practical help. We may call this need of arrangement a theoretic need or a practical need, according as we choose to laythe emphasis; but Bergson is accurately right when he limits conceptual knowledge to arrangement, and when he insists that arrangement isthe mere skirt and skin of the whole of what we ought to know."},{"pageNumber":792,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP745 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 33]Page 745deny, and persists in denying, that activities have any intelligible existence. What exists for thought, we are told, is atmost the results that we illusorily ascribe to such activities, strung along the surfaces of space and time by regeln derverknüpfung, laws of nature which state only coexistences and successions.Thought deals thus solely with surfaces. It can name the thickness of reality, but it cannot fathom it, and itsinsufficiency here is essential and permanent, not temporary.The only way in which to apprehend reality's thickness is either to experience it directly by being a part of realityone's self, or to evoke it in imagination by sympathetically divining some one else's inner life. But what we thusimmediately experience or concretely divine is very limited in duration, whereas abstractly we are able to conceiveeternities. Could we feel a million years concretely as we now feel a passing minute, we should have very littleemployment for our conceptual faculty. We should know the whole period fully at every moment of its passage,whereas we must now construct it laboriously by means of concepts which we project. Direct acquaintance andconceptual knowledge are thus complementary of each other; each remedies the other's defects. If what we care mostabout be the synoptic treatment of phenomena, the vision of the far and the gathering of the scattered like, we mustfollow the conceptual method. But if, as metaphysicians, we are more curious about the inner nature of reality or aboutwhat really makes it go, we must turn our backs upon our winged concepts altogether, and bury ourselves in thethickness of those passing moments over the surface of which they fly, and on particular points of which theyoccasionally rest and perch.Professor Bergson thus inverts the traditional platonic doctrine absolutely. Instead of intellectual knowledge being theprofounder, he calls it the more superficial. Instead of being the only adequate knowledge, it is grossly inadequate,and its only superiority is the practical one of enabling us to make short cuts through experience and thereby to savetime. The one thing it cannot do is to reveal the nature of things—which last remark, if not clear already, will becomeclearer as I proceed. Dive back into the flux itself, then, Bergson tells"},{"pageNumber":793,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP746 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 45]Page 746us, if you wish to know reality, that flux which Platonism, in its strange belief that only the immutable is excellent, hasalways spurned; turn your face toward sensation, that flesh-bound thing which rationalism has always loaded withabuse.—This, you see, is exactly the opposite remedy from that of looking forward into the absolute, which ouridealistic contemporaries prescribe. It violates our mental habits, being a kind of passive and receptive listening quitecontrary to that effort to react noisily and verbally on everything, which is our usual intellectual pose.What, then, are the peculiar features in the perceptual flux which the conceptual translation so fatally leaves out?The essence of life is its continuously changing character; but our concepts are all discontinuous and fixed, and theonly mode of making them coincide with life is by arbitrarily supposing positions of arrest therein. With such arrestsour concepts may be made congruent. But these concepts are not parts of reality, not real positions taken by it, butsuppositions rather, notes taken by ourselves, and you can no more dip up the substance of reality with them than youcan dip up water with a net, however finely meshed.When we conceptualize, we cut out and fix, and exclude everything but what we have fixed. A concept means a that-and-no-other. Conceptually, time excludes space; motion and rest exclude each other; approach excludes contact;presence excludes absence; unity excludes plurality; independence excludes relativity; 'mine' excludes 'yours'; thisconnexion excludes that connexion—and so on indefinitely; whereas in the real concrete sensible flux of lifeexperiences compenetrate each other so that it is not easy to know just what is excluded and what not. Past and future,for example, conceptually separated by the cut to which we give the name of present, and defined as being theopposite sides of that cut, are to some extent, however broef, co-present with each other throughout experience. Theliterally present moment is a purely verbal supposition, not a position; the only present ever realized concretely beingthe 'passing moment' in which the dying rearward of time and its dawning future forever mix their lights.

The conception of the first half of the interval between Achilles and the tortoise excludes that of the lasthalf, and the mathematical necessity of traversing it separately before the last half is traversed stands permanently inthe way of the last half ever being traversed. Meanwhile the living Achilles (who, for the purposes of this discussion,is only the abstract name of one phenomenon of impetus, just as the tortoise is of another) asks no leave of logic. Thevelocity of his acts is an indivisible nature in them like the expansive tension in a spring compressed. We define itconceptually as s/t, but the s and t are only artificial cuts made after the fact, and indeed most artificial when we treatthem in both runners as the same tracts of 'objective' space and time, for the experienced spaces and times in whichthe tortoise inwardly lives are probably as different as his velocity from the same things in Achilles. The impetus ofAchilles is one concrete fact, and carries space, time, and conquest over the inferior creature's motion indivisibly in it.He perceives nothing, while running, of the mathematician's homogeneous time and space, of the infinitely numeroussuccession of cuts in both, or of their order. End and beginning come for him in the one onrush, and all that heactually experiences is that, in the midst of a certain intense effort of his own, the rival is in point of fact outstripped.We are so inveterately wedded to the conceptual decomposition of life that I know that this will seem to you likeputting muddiest confusion in place of clearest thought, and relapsing into a molluscoid state of mind. Yet I ask youwhether the absolute superiority of our higher thought is so very clear, if all that it can find is impossibility in taskswhich sense-experience so easily performs.What makes you call real life confusion is that it presents, as if they were dissolved in one another, a lot of differentswhich conception breaks life's flow by keeping apart. But are not differents actually dissolved in one another? Has n'tevery bit of experience its quality, its duration, its extension, its intensity, its urgency, its clearness, and many aspectsbesides, no one of which can exist in the isolation in which our"},{"pageNumber":795,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP748 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 50]Page 748verbalized logic keeps it? They exist only durcheinander. Reality always is, in M. Bergson's phrase, an endosmosis orconflux of the same with the different: they compenetrate and telescope. For conceptual logic, the same is nothing butthe same, and all sames with a third thing are the same with each other. Not so in concrete experience. Two spots onour skin, each of which feels the same as a third spot when touched along with it, are felt as different from each other.Two tones, neither distinguishable from a third tone, are perfectly distinct from each other. The whole process of lifeis due to life's violation of our logical axioms. Take its continuity as an example. Terms like A and C appear to beconnected by intermediaries, by B for example. Intellectualism calls this absurd, for 'B-connected-with-A' is, 'as such,'a different term from 'B-connected-with-C.' But real life laughs at logic's veto. Imagine a heavy log which takes twomen to carry it. First A and B take it. Then C takes hold and A drops off; then D takes hold and B drops off, so that Cand D now bear it; and so on. The log meanwhile never drops, and keeps its sameness throughout the journey. Evenso it is with all our experiences. Their changes are not complete annihilations followed by complete creations ofsomething absolutely novel. There is partial decay and partial growth, and all the while a nucleus of relative constancyfrom which what decays drops off, and which takes into itself whatever is grafted on, until at length something whollydifferent has taken its place. In such a process we are as sure, in spite of intellectualist logic with its 'as suches,' that itis the same nucleus which is able now to make connexion with what goes and again with what comes, as we are surethat the same point can lie on diverse lines that intersect there. Without being one throughout, such a universe iscontinuous. Its members interdigitate with their next neighbors in manifold directions, and there are no clean cutsbetween them anywhere.The great clash of intellectualist logic with sensible experience is where the experience is that of influence exerted.Intellectualism denies (as we saw in lecture ii) that finite things can act on one another, for all things, once translatedinto concepts, remain shut up to themselves. To act on anything means to get into it somehow; but that would mean toget"},{"pageNumber":796,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP749 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 53]Page 749out of one's self and be one's other, which is self-contradictory, etc. Meanwhile each of us actually is his own other tothat extent, livingly knowing how to perform the trick which logic tells us can't be done. My thoughts animate andactuate this very body which you see and hear, and thereby influence your thoughts. The dynamic current somehowdoes get from me to you, however numerous the intermediary conductors may have to be. Distinctions may beinsulators in logic as much as they like, but in life distinct things can and do commune together every moment.The conflict of the two ways of knowing is best summed up in the intellectualist doctrine that 'the same cannot exist inmany relations.' This follows of course from the concepts of the two relations being so distinct that 'what-is-in-the-one' means 'as such' something distinct from what 'what-is-in-the-other' means. It is like Mill's ironical saying, that weshould not think of Newton as both an Englishman and a mathematician, because an Englishman as such is not amathematician and a mathematician as such is not an Englishman. But the real Newton was somehow both things atonce; and throughout the whole finite universe each real thing proves to be many differents without undergoing thenecessity of breaking into disconnected editions of itself.These few indications will perhaps suffice to put you at the bergsonian point of view. The immediate experience oflife solves the problems which so baffle our conceptual intelligence: How can what is manifold be one? how canthings get out of themselves? how be their own others? how be both distinct and connected? how can they act on oneanother? how be for others and yet for themselves? how be absent and present at once? The intellect asks thesequestions much as we might ask how anything can both separate and unite things, or how sounds can grow more alikeby continuing to grow more different. If you already know space sensibly, you can answer the former question bypointing to any interval in it, long or short; if you know the musical scale, you can answer the latter by sounding anoctave; but then you must first have the sensible knowledge of these realities. Similarly Bergson answers theintellectualist conundrums by pointing back to our various finite sensational ex-"},{"pageNumber":797,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP750 hl[01 03 2011 01 46 55]Page 750periences and saying, 'Lo, even thus; even so are these other problems solved livingly.'When you have broken the reality into concepts you never can reconstruct it in its wholeness. Out of no amount ofdiscreteness can you manufacture the concrete. But place yourself at a bound, or d'emblée, as M. Bergson says, insideof the living, moving, active thickness of the real, and all the abstractions and distinctions are given into your hand:you can now make the intellectualist substitutions to your heart's content. Install yourself in phenomenal movement,for example, and velocity, succession, dates, positions, and innumerable other things are given you in the bargain. Butwith only an abstract succession of dates and positions you can never patch up movement itself. It slips through theirintervals and is lost.So it is with every concrete thing, however complicated. Our intellectual handling of it is a retrospective patchwork, apost-mortem dissection, and can follow any order we find most expedient. We can make the thing seem self-contradictory whenever we wish to. But place yourself at the point of view of the thing's interior doing, and all theseback-looking and conflicting conceptions lie harmoniously in your hand. Get at the expanding centre of a humancharacter, the élan vital of a man, as Bergson calls it, by living sympathy, and at a stroke you see how it makes thosewho see it from without interpret it in such diverse ways. It is something that breaks into both honesty and dishonesty,courage and cowardice, stupidity and insight, at the touch of varying circumstances, and you feel exactly why andhow it does this, and never seek to identify it stably with any of these single abstractions. Only your intellectualistdoes that,—and you now also feel why he must do it to the end.Place yourself similarly at the centre of a man's philosophic vision and you understand at once all the different thingsit makes him write or say. But keep outside, use your post-mortem method, try to build the philosophy up out of thesingle phrases, taking first one and then another and seeking to make them fit 'logically,' and of course you fail. Youcrawl over the thing like a myopic ant over a building, tumbling into every microscopic crack or fissure, findingnothing but"},{"pageNumber":798,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP751 hl[01 03 2011 13 42 04]Page 751inconsistencies, and never suspecting that a centre exists. I hope that some of the philosophers in this audience mayoccasionally have had something different from this intellectualist type of criticism applied to their own works!What really exists is not things made but things in the making. Once made, they are dead, and an infinite number ofalternative conceptual decompositions can be used in defining them. But put yourself in the making by a stroke ofintuitive sympathy with the thing and, the whole range of possible decompositions coming at once into yourpossession, you are no longer troubled with the question which of them is the more absolutely true. Reality falls inpassing into conceptual analysis; it mounts in living its own undivided life—it buds and bourgeons, changes andcreates. Once adopt the movement of this life in any given instance and you know what Bergson calls the devenir réelby which the thing evolves and grows. Philosophy should seek this kind of living understanding of the movement ofreality, not follow science in vainly patching together fragments of its dead results.Thus much of M. Bergson's philosophy is sufficient for my purpose in these lectures, so here I will stop, leavingunnoticed all its other constituent features, original and interesting tho they be. You may say, and doubtless some ofyou now are saying inwardly, that his remanding us to sensation in this wise is only a regress, a return to that ultra-crude empiricism which your own idealists since Green have buried ten times over. I confess that it is indeed a returnto empiricism, but I think that the return in such accomplished shape only proves the latter's immortal truth. Whatwon't stay buried must have some genuine life. Am anfang war die tat; fact is a first; to which all our conceptualhandling comes as an inadequate second, never its full equivalent. When I read recent transcendentalist literature—Imust partly except my colleague Royce!—I get nothing but a sort of marking of time, champing of jaws, pawing ofthe ground, and resettling into the same attitude, like a weary horse in a stall with an empty manger. It is but turningover the same few threadbare categories, bringing the same objections, and urging the same answers and solutions,with never a new fact or a new horizon coming into sight. But open Bergson, and new horizons loom on"},{"pageNumber":799,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP752 hl[01 03 2011 13 43 11]Page 752every page you read. It is like the breath of the morning and the song of birds. It tells of reality itself, instead ofmerely reiterating what dusty-minded professors have written about what other previous professors have thought.Nothing in Bergson is shop-worn or at second hand.That he gives us no closed-in system will of course be fatal to him in intellectualist eyes. He only evokes and invites;but he first annuls the intellectualist veto, so that we now join step with reality with a philosophical conscience neverquite set free before. As a french disciple of his well expresses it: 'Bergson claims of us first of all a certain innercatastrophe, and not every one is capable of such a logical revolution. But those who have once found themselvesflexible enough for the execution of such a psychological change of front, discover somehow that they can neverreturn again to their ancient attitude of mind. They are now Bergsonians and possess the principal thoughts of themaster all at once. They have understood in the fashion in which one loves, they have caught the whole melody andcan thereafter admire at their leisure the originality, the fecundity, and the imaginative genius with which its authordevelops, transposes, and varies in a thousand ways by the orchestration of his style and dialectic, the original theme.'1This, scant as it is, is all I have to say about Bergson on this occasion—I hope it may send some of you to his originaltext. I must now turn back to the point where I found it advisable to appeal to his ideas. You remember my ownintellectualist difficulties in the last lecture, about how a lot of separate consciousnesses can at the same time be onecollective thing. How, I asked, can one and the same identical content of experience, of which on idealist principlesthe esse is to be felt, be felt so diversely if itself be the only feeler? The usual way of escape by 'quatenus' or 'as such'won't help us here if we are radical intellectualists, I said, for appearance-together is as such not appearance-apart, theworld quâ many is not the world quâ one, as absolutism claims. If we hold to Hume's maxim, which laterintellectualism uses so well, that whatever things are distinguished are as separate as if there1Gaston Rageot, Revue Philosophique, vol. lxiv, p. 85 (July, 1907)."},{"pageNumber":800,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP753 hl[01 03 2011 13 44 19]Page 753were no manner of connexion between them, there seemed no way out of the difficulty save by stepping outside ofexperience altogether and invoking different spiritual agents, selves or souls, to realize the diversity required. But thisrescue by 'scholastic entities' I was unwilling to accept any more than pantheistic idealists accept it.Yet, to quote Fechner's phrase again, 'nichts wirkliches kann unmöglich sein,' the actual cannot be impossible, andwhat is actual at every moment of our lives is the sort of thing which I now proceed to remind you of. You can hearthe vibration of an electric contact-maker, smell the ozone, see the sparks, and feel the thrill, co-consciously as itwere or in one field of experience. But you can also isolate any one of these sensations by shutting out the rest. If youclose your eyes, hold your nose, and remove your hand, you can get the sensation of sound alone, but it seems still thesame sensation that it was; and if you restore the action of the other organs, the sound coalesces with the feeling, thesight, and the smell sensations again. Now the natural way of talking of all this1 is to say that certain sensations areexperienced, now singly, and now together with other sensations, in a common conscious field. Fluctuations ofattention give analogous results. We let a sensation in or keep it out by changing our attention; and similarly we let anitem of memory in or drop it out. [Please don't raise the question here of how these changes come to pass. Theimmediate condition is probably cerebral in every instance, but it would be irrelevant now to consider it, for now weare thinking only of results, and I repeat that the natural way of thinking of them is that which intellectualist criticismfinds so absurd.]The absurdity charged is that the self-same should function so differently, now with and now without something else.But this it sensibly seems to do. This very desk which I strike with my hand strikes in turn your eyes. It functions atonce as a physical object in the outer world and as a mental object in our sundry mental worlds. The very body ofmine that my thought actuates is the body whose gestures are your visual1I have myself talked in other ways as plausibly as I could, in my Psychology, and talked truly (as I believe) in certain selected cases;but for other cases the natural way invincibly comes back."},{"pageNumber":801,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP754 hl[01 03 2011 13 45 26]Page 754object and to which you give my name. The very log which John helped to carry is the log now borne by James. Thevery girl you love is simultaneously entangled elsewhere. The very place behind me is in front of you. Look whereyou will, you gather only examples of the same amid the different, and of different relations existing as it were insolution in the same thing. Quâ this an experience is not the same as it is quâ that, truly enough; but the quâ areconceptual shots of ours at its post-mortem remains, and in its sensational immediacy everything is all at oncewhatever different things it is at once at all. It is before C and after A, far from you and near to me, without thisassociate and with that one, active and passive, physical and mental, a whole of parts and part of a higher whole, allsimultaneously and without interference or need of doubling-up its being, so long as we keep to what I call the'immediate' point of view, the point of view in which we follow our sensational life's continuity, and to which allliving language conforms. It is only when you try—to continue using the hegelian vocabulary—to 'mediate' theimmediate, or to substitute concepts for sensational life, that intellectualism celebrates its triumph and the immanent-self-contradictoriness of all this smooth-running finite experience gets proved.Of the oddity of inventing as a remedy for the inconveniences resulting from this situation a supernumeraryconceptual object called an absolute, into which you pack the self-same contradictions unreduced, I will saysomething in the next lecture. The absolute is said to perform its feats by taking up its other into itself. But that isexactly what is done when every individual morsel of the sensational stream takes up the adjacent morsels bycoalescing with them. This is just what we mean by the stream's sensible continuity. No element there cuts itself offfrom any other element, as concepts cut themselves from concepts. No part there is so small as not to be a place ofconflux. No part there is not really next its neighbors; which means that there is literally nothing between; whichmeans again that no part goes exactly so far and no farther; that no part absolutely excludes another, but that theycompenetrate and are cohesive; that if you tear out one, its roots bring out more with them; that whatever is real istelescoped and diffused into other reals; that, in short, every"},{"pageNumber":802,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP755 hl[01 03 2011 13 46 34]Page 755minutest thing is already its hegelian 'own other,' in the fullest sense of the term.Of course this sounds self-contradictory, but as the immediate facts don't sound at all, but simply are, until weconceptualize and name them vocally, the contradiction results only from the conceptual or discursive form beingsubstituted for the real form. But if, as Bergson shows, that form is super-imposed for practical ends only, in order tolet us jump about over life instead of wading through it; and if it cannot even pretend to reveal anything of what life'sinner nature is or ought to be; why then we can turn a deaf ear to its accusations. The resolve to turn the deaf ear is theinner crisis or 'catastrophe' of which M. Bergson's disciple whom I lately quoted spoke. We are so subject to thephilosophic tradition which treats logos or discursive thought generally as the sole avenue to truth, that to fall back onraw unverbalized life as more of a revealer, and to think of concepts as the merely practical things which Bergsoncalls them, comes very hard. It is putting off our proud maturity of mind and becoming again as foolish little childrenin the eyes of reason. But difficult as such a revolution is, there is no other way, I believe, to the possession of reality,and I permit myself to hope that some of you may share my opinion after you have heard my next lecture."},{"pageNumber":803,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP756 hl[01 03 2011 13 47 41]Page 756Lecture VIIThe Continuity of ExperienceI fear that few of you will have been able to obey Bergson's call upon you to look towards the sensational life for thefuller knowledge of reality, or to sympathize with his attempt to limit the divine right of concepts to rule our mindabsolutely. It is too much like looking downward and not up. Philosophy, you will say, does n't lie flat on its belly inthe middle of experience, in the very thick of its sand and gravel, as this Bergsonism does, never getting a peep atanything from above. Philosophy is essentially the vision of things from above. It does n't simply feel the detail ofthings, it comprehends their intelligible plan, sees their forms and principles, their categories and rules, their order andnecessity. It takes the superior point of view of the architect. Is it conceivable that it should ever forsake that point ofview and abandon itself to a slovenly life of immediate feeling? To say nothing of your traditional Oxford devotion toAristotle and Plato, the leaven of T. H. Green probably works still too strongly here for his anti-sensationalism to beoutgrown quickly. Green more than any one realized that knowledge about things was knowledge of their relations;but nothing could persuade him that our sensational life could contain any relational element. He followed the strictintellectualist method with sensations. What they were not expressly defined as including, they must exclude.Sensations are not defined as relations, so in the end Green thought that they could get related together only by theaction on them from above of a 'self-distinguishing' absolute and eternal mind, present to that which is related, but notrelated itself. 'A relation,' he said, 'is not contingent with the contingency of feeling. It is permanent with thepermanence of the combining and comparing thought which alone constitutes it.'1 In other words, relations are purelyconceptual objects, and the sensational life as such cannot relate itself together. Sensation in itself, Green wrote, isfleeting, momentary, unnameable (because, while we1Introduction to Hume, 1874, p. 151."},{"pageNumber":804,"pageContent":" Page 757name it, it has become another), and for the same reason unknowable, the very negation of knowability. Were there nopermanent objects of conception for our sensations to be 'referred to,' there would be no significant names, but onlynoises, and a consistent sensationalism must be speechless.1 Green's intellectualism was so earnest that it produced anatural and an inevitable effect. But the atomistic and unrelated sensations which he had in mind were purelyfictitious products of his rationalist fancy. The psychology of our own day disavows them utterly,2 and Green'slaborious belaboring of poor old Locke for not having first seen that his ideas of sensation were just that impracticablesort of thing, and then fled to transcendental idealism as a remedy,—his belaboring of poor old Locke for this, I say,is pathetic. Every examiner of the sensible life in concreto must see that relations of every sort, of time, space,difference, likeness, change, rate, cause, or what not, are just as integral members of the sensational flux as terms are,and that conjunctive relations are just as true members of the flux as disjunctive relations are.3 This is what in somerecent writings of mine I have called the 'radically empiricist' doctrine (in distinction from the doctrine of mentalatoms which the name empiricism so often suggests). Intellectualistic critics of sensation insist that sensations aredisjoined only. Radical empiricism insists that conjunctions between them are just as immediately given asdisjunctions are, and that relations, whether disjunctive or conjunctive, are in their original sensible givenness just asfleeting and momentary (in Green's words), and just as 'particular,' as terms are. Later, both terms and relations getuniversalized by being conceptualized and named.4 But all the thickness, concrete-1Ibid., pp. 16, 21, 36, et passim.2See, inter alia, the chapter on the 'Stream of Thought' in my own Psychologies; H. Cornelius, Psychologie, 1897, chaps. i and iii; G. H.Luquet, Idées Générales de Psychologie, 1906, passim.3Compare, as to all this, an article by the present writer, entitled 'A world of pure experience,' in the Journal of Philosophy, New York, vol. i,pp. 533, 561 (1905).4Green's attempt to discredit sensations by reminding us of their 'dumbness,' in that they do not come already named, as concepts may be saidto do, only shows how intellectualism is dominated by verbality. The unnamed appears in Green as synonymous with the unreal."},{"pageNumber":805,"pageContent":" Page 758ness, and individuality of experience exists in the immediate and relatively unnamed stages of it, to the richness ofwhich, and to the standing inadequacy of our conceptions to match it, Professor Bergson so emphatically calls ourattention.And now I am happy to say that we can begin to gather together some of the separate threads of our argument, andsee a little better the general kind of conclusion toward which we are tending. Pray go back with me to the lecturebefore the last, and recall what I said about the difficulty of seeing how states of consciousness can compoundthemselves. The difficulty seemed to be the same, you remember, whether we took it in psychology as thecomposition of finite states of mind out of simpler finite states, or in metaphysics as the composition of the absolutemind out of finite minds in general. It is the general conceptualist difficulty of any one thing being the same withmany things, either at once or in succession, for the abstract concepts of oneness and manyness must needs excludeeach other. In the particular instance that we have dwelt on so long, the one thing is the all-form of experience, themany things are the each-forms of experience in you and me. To call them the same we must treat them as if eachwere simultaneously its own other, a feat on conceptualist principles impossible of performance.On the principle of going behind the conceptual function altogether, however, and looking to the more primitive fluxof the sensational life for reality's true shape, a way is open to us, as I tried in my last lecture to show. Not only theabsolute is its own other, but the simplest bits of immediate experience are their own others, if that hegelian phrase beonce for all allowed. The concrete pulses of experience appear pent in by no such definite limits as our conceptualsubstitutes for them are confined by. They run into one another continuously and seem to interpenetrate. What in themis relation and what is matter related is hard to discern. You feel no one of them as inwardly simple, and no two aswholly without confluence where they touch. There is no datum so small as not to show this mystery, if mystery it be.The tiniest feeling that we can possibly have comes with an earlier and a later part and with a sense of theircontinuous procession. Mr. Shadworth Hodgson showed long ago that there is"},{"pageNumber":806,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP759 hl[01 03 2011 13 48 49]Page 759literally no such object as the present moment except as an unreal postulate of abstract thought.1 The 'passing' momentis, as I already have reminded you, the minimal fact, with the 'apparition of difference' inside of it as well as outside.If we do not feel both past and present in one field of feeling, we feel them not at all. We have the same many-in-onein the matter that fills the passing time. The rush of our thought forward through its fringes is the everlastingpeculiarity of its life. We realize this life as something always off its balance, something in transition, something thatshoots out of a darkness through a dawn into a brightness that we feel to be the dawn fulfilled. In the very midst of thecontinuity our experience comes as an alteration. 'Yes,' we say at the full brightness, 'this is what I just meant.' 'No,'we feel at the dawning, 'this is not yet the full meaning, there is more to come.' In every crescendo of sensation, inevery effort to recall, in every progress towards the satisfaction of desire, this succession of an emptiness and fulnessthat have reference to each other and are one flesh is the essence of the phenomenon. In every hindrance of desire thesense of an ideal presence which is absent in fact, of an absent, in a word, which the only function of the present is tomean, is even more notoriously there. And in the movement of pure thought we have the same phenomenon. When Isay Socrates is mortal, the moment Socrates is incomplete; it falls forward through the is which is pure movement,into the mortal which is indeed bare mortal on the tongue, but for the mind is that mortal, the mortal Socrates, at lastsatisfactorily disposed of and told off.2Here, then, inside of the minimal pulses of experience, is realized that very inner complexity which thetranscendentalists say only the absolute can genuinely possess. The gist of the matter is always the same—somethingever goes indissolubly with something else. You cannot separate the same from its other, except by abandoning thereal altogether and taking to the conceptual system. What is immediately given1Philosophy of Reflection, i, 248 ff.2Most of this paragraph is extracted from an address of mine before the American Psychological Association, printed in the PsychologicalReview, vol. ii, p. 105. I take pleasure in the fact that already in 1895 I was so far advanced towards my present bergsonian position."},{"pageNumber":807,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP760 hl[01 03 2011 13 49 57]Page 760in the single and particular instance is always something pooled and mutual, something with no dark spot, no point ofignorance. No one elementary bit of reality is eclipsed from the next bit's point of view, if only we take realitysensibly and in small enough pulses—and by us it has to be taken pulse-wise, for our span of consciousness is tooshort to grasp the larger collectivity of things except nominally and abstractly. No more of reality collected together atonce is extant anywhere, perhaps, than in my experience of reading this page, or in yours of listening; yet within thosebits of experience as they come to pass we get a fulness of content that no conceptual description can equal.Sensational experiences are their 'own others,' then, both internally and externally. Inwardly they are one with theirparts, and outwardly they pass continuously into their next neighbors, so that events separated by years of time in aman's life hang together unbrokenly by the intermediary events. Their names, to be sure, cut them into separateconceptual entities, but no cuts existed in the continuum in which they originally came.If, with all this in our mind, we turn to our own particular predicament, we see that our old objection to the self-compounding of states of consciousness, our accusation that it was impossible for purely logical reasons, is unfoundedin principle. Every smallest state of consciousness, concretely taken, overflows its own definition. Only concepts areself-identical; only 'reason' deals with closed equations; nature is but a name for excess; every point in her opens outand runs into the more; and the only question, with reference to any point we may be considering, is how far into therest of nature we may have to go in order to get entirely beyond its overflow. In the pulse of inner life immediatelypresent now in each of us is a little past, a little future, a little awareness of our own body, of each other's persons, ofthese sublimities we are trying to talk about, of the earth's geography and the direction of history, of truth and error,of good and bad, and of who knows how much more? Feeling, however dimly and subconsciously, all these things,your pulse of inner life is continuous with them, belongs to them and they to it. You can't identify it with either one ofthem rather than with the others, for if you let it develop into no matter which of those"},{"pageNumber":808,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP761 hl[01 03 2011 13 51 04]Page 761directions, what it develops into will look back on it and say, 'That was the original germ of me.'In principle, then, the real units of our immediately-felt life are unlike the units that intellectualist logic holds to andmakes its calculations with. They are not separate from their own others, and you have to take them at widelyseparated dates to find any two of them that seem unblent. Then indeed they do appear separate even as their conceptsare separate; a chasm yawns between them; but the chasm itself is but an intellectualist fiction, got by abstracting fromthe continuous sheet of experiences with which the intermediary time was filled. It is like the log carried first byWilliam and Henry, then by William, Henry, and John, then by Henry and John, then by John and Peter, and so on.All real units of experience overlap. Let a row of equidistant dots on a sheet of paper symbolize the concepts bywhich we intellectualize the world. Let a ruler long enough to cover at least three dots stand for our sensibleexperience. Then the conceived changes of the sensible experience can be symbolized by sliding the ruler along theline of dots. One concept after another will apply to it, one after another drop away, but it will always cover at leasttwo of them, and no dots less than three will ever adequately cover it. You falsify it if you treat it conceptually, or bythe law of dots.What is true here of successive states must also be true of simultaneous characters. They also overlap each other withtheir being. My present field of consciousness is a centre surrounded by a fringe that shades insensibly into asubconscious more. I use three separate terms here to describe this fact; but I might as well use three hundred, for thefact is all shades and no boundaries. Which part of it properly is in my consciousness, which out? If I name what isout, it already has come in. The centre works in one way while the margins work in another, and presently overpowerthe centre and are central themselves. What we conceptually identify ourselves with and say we are thinking of at anytime is the centre; but our full self is the whole field, with all those indefinitely radiating subconscious possibilities ofincrease that we can only feel without conceiving, and can hardly begin to analyze. The collective and the distributiveways of being coexist here, for"},{"pageNumber":809,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP762 hl[01 03 2011 13 52 11]Page 762each part functions distinctly, makes connexion with its own peculiar region in the still wider rest of experience andtends to draw us into that line, and yet the whole is somehow felt as one pulse of our life,—not conceived so, but feltso.In principle, then, as I said, intellectualism's edge is broken; it can only approximate to reality, and its logic isinapplicable to our inner life, which spurns its vetoes and mocks at its impossibilities. Every bit of us at everymoment is part and parcel of a wider self, it quivers along various radii like the wind-rose on a compass, and theactual in it is continuously one with possibles not yet in our present sight.1 And just as we are co-conscious with ourown momentary margin, may not we ourselves form the margin of some more really central self in things which isco-conscious with the whole of us? May not you and I be confluent in a higher consciousness, and confluently activethere, tho we now know it not?I am tiring myself and you, I know, by vainly seeking to describe by concepts and words what I say at the same timeexceeds either conceptualization or verbalization. As long as one continues talking, intellectualism remains inundisturbed possession of the field. The return to life can't come about by talking. It is an act; to make you return tolife, I must set an example for your imitation, I must deafen you to talk, or to the importance of talk, by showing you,as Bergson does, that the concepts we talk with are made for purposes of practice and not for purposes of insight. Or Imust point, point to the mere that of life, and you by inner sympathy must fill out the what for yourselves. The mindsof some of you, I know, will absolutely refuse to do so, refuse to think in non-conceptualized terms. I myselfabsolutely refused to do so for years to-1The conscious self of the moment, the central self, is probably determined to this privileged position by its functional connexion withthe body's imminent or present acts. It is the present acting self. Tho the more that surrounds it may be 'subconscious' to us, yet if in its'collective capacity' it also exerts an active function, it may be conscious in a wider way, conscious, as it were, over our heads.On the relations of consciousness to action see Bergson's Matière et Mémoire, passim, especially chap. i.

But I hoped ever for a revised intellectualist way round thedifficulty, and it was only after reading Bergson that I saw that to continue using the intellectualist method was itselfthe fault. I saw that philosophy had been on a false scent ever since the days of Socrates and Plato, that an intellectualanswer to the intellectualist's difficulties will never come, and that the real way out of them, far from consisting in thediscovery of such an answer, consists in simply closing one's ears to the question. When conceptualism summons lifeto justify itself in conceptual terms, it is like a challenge addressed in a foreign language to some one who is absorbedin his own business; it is irrelevant to him altogether—he may let it lie unnoticed. I went thus through the 'innercatastrophe' of which I spoke in the last lecture; I had literally come to the end of my conceptual stock-in-trade, I wasbankrupt intellectualistically, and had to change my base. No words of mine will probably convert you, for words canbe the names only of concepts. But if any of you try sincerely and pertinaciously on your own separate accounts tointellectualize reality, you may be similarly driven to a change of front. I say no more: I must leave life to teach thelesson.We have now reached a point of view from which the self-compounding of mind in its smaller and more accessibleportions seems a certain fact, and in which the speculative assumption of a similar but wider compounding in remoterregions must be reckoned with as a legitimate hypothesis. The absolute is not the impossible being I once thought it.Mental facts do function both singly and together, at once, and we finite minds may simultaneously be co-consciouswith one another in a superhuman intelligence. It is only the extravagant claims of coercive necessity on the absolute'spart that have to be denied by a priori logic. As an hypothesis trying to make itself probable on analogical andinductive grounds, the absolute is entitled to a patient hearing. Which is as much as to say that our serious businessfrom now onward lies with Fechner and his method, rather than with Hegel, Royce, or Bradley. Fechner treats thesuperhuman consciousness he so"},{"pageNumber":811,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP764 hl[01 03 2011 13 54 26]Page 764fervently believes in as an hypothesis only, which he then recommends by all the resources of induction andpersuasion.It is true that Fechner himself is an absolutist in his books, not actively but passively, if I may say so. He talks notonly of the earth-soul and of the star-souls, but of an integrated soul of all things in the cosmos without exception,and this he calls God just as others call it the absolute. Nevertheless he thinks only of the subordinate superhumansouls, and content with having made his obeisance once for all to the august total soul of the cosmos, he leaves it in itslonely sublimity with no attempt to define its nature. Like the absolute, it is 'out of range,' and not an object fordistincter vision. Psychologically, it seems to me that Fechner's God is a lazy postulate of his, rather than a part of hissystem positively thought out. As we envelop our sight and hearing, so the earth-soul envelops us, and the star-soulthe earth-soul, until—what? Envelopment can't go on forever; it must have an abschluss, a total envelope mustterminate the series, so God is the name that Fechner gives to this last all-enveloper. But if nothing escapes this all-enveloper, he is responsible for everything, including evil, and all the paradoxes and difficulties which I found in theabsolute at the end of our third lecture recur undiminished. Fechner tries sincerely to grapple with the problem of evil,but he always solves it in the leibnitzian fashion by making his God non-absolute, placing him under conditions of'metaphysical necessity' which even his omnipotence cannot violate. His will has to struggle with conditions notimposed on that will by itself. He tolerates provisionally what he has not created, and then with endless patience triesto overcome it and live it down. He has, in short, a history. Whenever Fechner tries to represent him clearly, his Godbecomes the ordinary God of theism, and ceases to be the absolutely totalized all-enveloper.1 In this shape, herepresents the ideal element in things solely, and is our champion and our helper and we his helpers, against the badparts of the universe.Fechner was in fact too little of a metaphysician to care for perfect formal consistency in these abstract regions. Hebelieved in God in the pluralistic manner, but partly from1Compare Zend-Avesta, 2d edition, vol. i, pp. 165 ff., 181, 206, 244 ff., etc.; Die Tagesansicht, etc., chap. v, § 6; and chap. xv."},{"pageNumber":812,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP765 hl[01 03 2011 13 55 33]Page 765convention and partly from what I should call intellectual laziness, if laziness of any kind could be imputed to aFechner, he let the usual monistic talk about him pass unchallenged. I propose to you that we should discuss thequestion of God without entangling ourselves in advance in the monistic assumption. Is it probable that there is anysuperhuman consciousness at all, in the first place? When that is settled, the further question whether its form bemonistic or pluralistic is in order.Before advancing to either question, however, and I shall have to deal with both but very briefly after what has beensaid already, let me finish our retrospective survey by one more remark about the curious logical situation of theabsolutists. For what have they invoked the absolute except as a being the peculiar inner form of which shall enable itto overcome the contradictions with which intellectualism has found the finite many as such to be infected? Themany-in-one character that, as we have seen, every smallest tract of finite experience offers, is considered byintellectualism to be fatal to the reality of finite experience. What can be distinguished, it tells us, is separate; andwhat is separate is unrelated, for a relation, being a 'between,' would bring only a twofold separation. Hegel, Royce,Bradley, and the Oxford absolutists in general seem to agree about this logical absurdity of manyness-in-oneness inthe only places where it is empirically found. But see the curious tactics! Is the absurdity reduced in the absolutebeing whom they call in to relieve it? Quite otherwise, for that being shows it on an infinitely greater scale, andflaunts it in its very definition. The fact of its not being related to any outward environment, the fact that all relationsare inside of itself, does n't save it, for Mr. Bradley's great argument against the finite is that in any given bit of it (abit of sugar, for instance) the presence of a plurality of characters (whiteness and sweetness, for example) is self-contradictory; so that in the final end all that the absolute's name appears to stand for is the persistent claim ofoutraged human nature that reality shall not be called absurd. Somewhere there must be an aspect of it guiltless ofself-contradiction. All we can see of the absolute, meanwhile, is guilty in the same way in which the finite is.Intellectualism sees what it calls the guilt,"},{"pageNumber":813,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP766 hl[01 03 2011 13 56 40]Page 766when comminuted in the finite object; but is too near-sighted to see it in the more enormous object. Yet the absolute'sconstitution, if imagined at all, has to be imagined after the analogy of some bit of finite experience. Take any real bit,suppress its environment and then magnify it to monstrosity, and you get identically the type of structure of theabsolute. It is obvious that all your difficulties here remain and go with you. If the relative experience was inwardlyabsurd, the absolute experience is infinitely more so. Intellectualism, in short, strains off the gnat, but swallows thewhole camel. But this polemic against the absolute is as odious to me as it is to you, so I will say no more about thatbeing. It is only one of those wills of the wisp, those lights that do mislead the morn, that have so often impeded theclear progress of philosophy, so I will turn to the more general positive question of whether superhuman unities ofconsciousness should be considered as more probable or more improbable.In a former lecture I went over some of the fechnerian reasons for their plausibility, or reasons that at least replied toour more obvious grounds of doubt concerning them. The numerous facts of divided or split human personality whichthe genius of certain medical men, as Janet, Freud, Prince, Sidis, and others, have unearthed were unknown inFechner's time, and neither the phenomena of automatic writing and speech, nor of mediumship and 'possession'generally, had been recognized or studied as we now study them, so Fechner's stock of analogies is scant comparedwith our present one. He did the best with what he had, however. For my own part I find in some of these abnormalor supernormal facts the strongest suggestions in favor of a superior co-consciousness being possible. I doubt whetherwe shall ever understand some of them without using the very letter of Fechner's conception of a great reservoir inwhich the memories of earth's inhabitants are pooled and preserved, and from which, when the threshold lowers orthe valve opens, information ordinarily shut out leaks into the mind of exceptional individuals among us. But thoseregions of inquiry are perhaps too spook-haunted to interest an academic audience, and the only evidence I feel it nowdecorous to bring to the support of Fechner is drawn from ordinary religious experience. I think"},{"pageNumber":814,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP767 hl[01 03 2011 13 57 48]Page 767it may be asserted that there are religious experiences of a specific nature, not deducible by analogy or psychologicalreasoning from our other sorts of experience. I think that they point with reasonable probability to the continuity ofour consciousness with a wider spiritual environment from which the ordinary prudential man (who is the only manthat scientific psychology, so called, takes cognizance of) is shut off. I shall begin my final lecture by referring to themagain briefly."},{"pageNumber":815,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP768 hl[01 03 2011 13 58 55]Page 768Lecture VIIIConclusionsAt the close of my last lecture I referred to the existence of religious experiences of a specific nature. I must nowexplain just what I mean by such a claim. Briefly, the facts I have in mind may all be described as experiences of anunexpected life succeeding upon death. By this I don't mean immortality, or the death of the body. I mean thedeathlike termination of certain mental processes within the individual's experience, processes that run to failure, andin some individuals, at least, eventuate in despair. Just as romantic love seems a comparatively recent literaryinvention, so these experiences of a life that supervenes upon despair seem to have played no great part in officialtheology till Luther's time; and possibly the best way to indicate their character will be to point to a certain contrastbetween the inner life of ourselves and of the ancient Greeks and Romans.Mr. Chesterton, I think, says somewhere, that the Greeks and Romans, in all that concerned their moral life, were anextraordinarily solemn set of folks. The Athenians thought that the very gods must admire the rectitude of Phocionand Aristides; and those gentlemen themselves were apparently of much the same opinion. Cato's veracity was soimpeccable that the extremest incredulity a Roman could express of anything was to say, 'I would not believe it evenif Cato had told me.' Good was good, and bad was bad, for these people. Hypocrisy, which church-Christianitybrought in, hardly existed; the naturalistic system held firm; its values showed no hollowness and brooked no irony.The individual, if virtuous enough, could meet all possible requirements. The pagan pride had never crumbled. Lutherwas the first moralist who broke with any effectiveness through the crust of all this naturalistic self-sufficiency,thinking (and possibly he was right) that Saint Paul had done it already. Religious experience of the lutheran typebrings all our naturalistic standards to bankruptcy. You are strong only by being weak, it shows. You cannot live onpride or self-sufficingness. There is a light in"},{"pageNumber":816,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP769 hl[01 03 2011 14 00 02]Page 769which all the naturally founded and currently accepted distinctions, excellences, and safeguards of our charactersappear as utter childishness. Sincerely to give up one's conceit or hope of being good in one's own right is the onlydoor to the universe's deeper reaches.These deeper reaches are familiar to evangelical Christianity and to what is nowadays becoming known as 'mind-cure'religion or 'new thought.' The phenomenon is that of new ranges of life succeeding on our most despairing moments.There are resources in us that naturalism with its literal and legal virtues never recks of, possibilities that take ourbreath away, of another kind of happiness and power, based on giving up our own will and letting something higherwork for us, and these seem to show a world wider than either physics or philistine ethics can imagine. Here is aworld in which all is well, in spite of certain forms of death, indeed because of certain forms of death—death of hope,death of strength, death of responsibility, of fear and worry, competency and desert, death of everything thatpaganism, naturalism, and legalism pin their faith on and tie their trust to.Reason, operating on our other experiences, even our psychological experiences, would never have inferred thesespecifically religious experiences in advance of their actual coming. She could not suspect their existence, for they arediscontinuous with the 'natural' experiences they succeed upon and invert their values. But as they actually come andare given, creation widens to the view of their recipients. They suggest that our natural experience, our strictlymoralistic and prudential experience, may be only a fragment of real human experience. They soften nature's outlinesand open out the strangest possibilities and perspectives.This is why it seems to me that the logical understanding, working in abstraction from such specifically religiousexperiences, will always omit something, and fail to reach completely adequate conclusions. Death and failure, it willalways say, are death and failure simply, and can nevermore be one with life; so religious experience, peculiarly socalled, needs, in my opinion, to be carefully considered and interpreted by every one who aspires to reason out a morecomplete philosophy."},{"pageNumber":817,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP770 hl[01 03 2011 14 01 09]Page 770The sort of belief that religious experience of this type naturally engenders in those who have it is fully in accord withFechner's theories. To quote words which I have used elsewhere, the believer finds that the tenderer parts of hispersonal life are continuous with a more of the same quality which is operative in the universe outside of him andwhich he can keep in working touch with, and in a fashion get on board of and save himself, when all his lower beinghas gone to pieces in the wreck. In a word, the believer is continuous, to his own consciousness, at any rate, with awider self from which saving experiences flow in. Those who have such experiences distinctly enough and oftenenough to live in the light of them remain quite unmoved by criticism, from whatever quarter it may come, be itacademic or scientific, or be it merely the voice of logical common sense. They have had their vision and theyknow—that is enough—that we inhabit an invisible spiritual environment from which help comes, our soul beingmysteriously one with a larger soul whose instruments we are.One may therefore plead, I think, that Fechner's ideas are not without direct empirical verification. There is at any rateone side of life which would be easily explicable if those ideas were true, but of which there appears no clearexplanation so long as we assume either with naturalism that human consciousness is the highest consciousness thereis, or with dualistic theism that there is a higher mind in the cosmos, but that it is discontinuous with our own. It hasalways been a matter of surprise with me that philosophers of the absolute should have shown so little interest in thisdepartment of life, and so seldom put its phenomena in evidence, even when it seemed obvious that personalexperience of some kind must have made their confidence in their own vision so strong. The logician's bias hasalways been too much with them. They have preferred the thinner to the thicker method, dialectical abstraction beingso much more dignified and academic than the confused and unwholesome facts of personal biography.In spite of rationalism's disdain for the particular, the personal, and the unwholesome, the drift of all the evidence wehave seems to me to sweep us very strongly towards the belief in some form of superhuman life with which we may,"},{"pageNumber":818,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP771 hl[01 03 2011 14 02 17]Page 771unknown to ourselves, be co-conscious. We may be in the universe as dogs and cats are in our libraries, seeing thebooks and hearing the conversation, but having no inkling of the meaning of it all. The intellectualist objections to thisfall away when the authority of intellectualist logic is undermined by criticism, and then the positive empiricalevidence remains. The analogies with ordinary psychology and with the facts of pathology, with those of psychicalresearch, so called, and with those of religious experience, establish, when taken together, a decidedly formidableprobability in favor of a general view of the world almost identical with Fechner's. The outlines of the superhumanconsciousness thus made probable must remain, however, very vague, and the number of functionally distinct 'selves'it comports and carries has to be left entirely problematic. It may be polytheistically or it may be monotheisticallyconceived of. Fechner, with his distinct earth-soul functioning as our guardian angel, seems to me clearly polytheistic;but the word 'polytheism' usually gives offence, so perhaps it is better not to use it. Only one thing is certain, and thatis the result of our criticism of the absolute: the only way to escape from the paradoxes and perplexities that aconsistently thought-out monistic universe suffers from as from a species of auto-intoxication—the mystery of the'fall' namely, of reality lapsing into appearance, truth into error, perfection into imperfection; of evil, in short; themystery of universal determinism, of the block-universe eternal and without a history, etc.;—the only way of escape, Isay, from all this is to be frankly pluralistic and assume that the superhuman consciousness, however vast it may be,has itself an external environment, and consequently is finite. Present day monism carefully repudiates complicitywith spinozistic monism. In that, it explains, the many get dissolved in the one and lost, whereas in the improvedidealistic form they get preserved in all their manyness as the one's eternal object. The absolute itself is thusrepresented by absolutists as having a pluralistic object. But if even the absolute has to have a pluralistic vision, whyshould we ourselves hesitate to be pluralists on our own sole account? Why should we envelop our many with the'one' that brings so much poison in its train?The line of least resistance, then, as it seems to me, both in"},{"pageNumber":819,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP772 hl[01 03 2011 14 03 24]Page 772theology and in philosophy, is to accept, along with the superhuman consciousness, the notion that it is not all-embracing, the notion, in other words, that there is a God, but that he is finite, either in power or in knowledge, or inboth at once. These, I need hardly tell you, are the terms in which common men have usually carried on their activecommerce with God; and the monistic perfections that make the notion of him so paradoxical practically and morallyare the colder addition of remote professorial minds operating in distans upon conceptual substitutes for him alone.Why cannot 'experience' and 'reason' meet on this common ground? Why cannot they compromise? May not thegodlessness usually but needlessly associated with the philosophy of immediate experience give way to a theism nowseen to follow directly from that experience more widely taken? and may not rationalism, satisfied with seeing her apriori proofs of God so effectively replaced by empirical evidence, abate something of her absolutist claims? Let Godbut have the least infinitesimal other of any kind beside him, and empiricism and rationalism might strike hands in alasting treaty of peace. Both might then leave abstract thinness behind them, and seek together, as scientific men seek,by using all the analogies and data within reach, to build up the most probable approximate idea of what the divineconsciousness concretely may be like. I venture to beg the younger Oxford idealists to consider seriously thisalternative. Few men are as qualified by their intellectual gifts to reap the harvests that seem certain to any one who,like Fechner and Bergson, will leave the thinner for the thicker path.Compromise and mediation are inseparable from the pluralistic philosophy. Only monistic dogmatism can say of anyof its hypotheses, 'It is either that or nothing; take it or leave it just as it stands.' The type of monism prevalent atOxford has kept this steep and brittle attitude, partly through the proverbial academic preference for thin and elegantlogical solutions, partly from a mistaken notion that the only solidly grounded basis for religion was along those lines.If Oxford men could be ignorant of anything, it might almost seem that they had remained ignorant of the greatempirical movement towards a pluralistic panpsychic view of the universe, into"},{"pageNumber":820,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP773 hl[01 03 2011 14 04 31]Page 773which our own generation has been drawn, and which threatens to short-circuit their methods entirely and becometheir religious rival unless they are willing to make themselves its allies. Yet, wedded as they seem to be to the logicalmachinery and technical apparatus of absolutism, I cannot but believe that their fidelity to the religious ideal ingeneral is deeper still. Especially do I find it hard to believe that the more clerical adherents of the school would holdso fast to its particular machinery if only they could be made to think that religion could be secured in some otherway. Let empiricism once become associated with religion, as hitherto, through some strange misunderstanding, it hasbeen associated with irreligion, and I believe that a new era of religion as well as of philosophy will be ready tobegin. That great awakening of a new popular interest in philosophy, which is so striking a phenomenon at the presentday in all countries, is undoubtedly due in part to religious demands. As the authority of past tradition tends more andmore to crumble, men naturally turn a wistful ear to the authority of reason or to the evidence of present fact. Theywill assuredly not be disappointed if they open their minds to what the thicker and more radical empiricism has to say.I fully believe that such an empiricism is a more natural ally than dialectics ever were, or can be, of the religious life.It is true that superstitions and wild-growing over-beliefs of all sorts will undoubtedly begin to abound if the notion ofhigher consciousness enveloping ours, of fechnerian earth-souls and the like, grows orthodox and fashionable; stillmore will they superabound if science ever puts her approving stamp on the phenomena of which Frederic Myers soearnestly advocated the scientific recognition, the phenomena of psychic research so-called—and I myself firmlybelieve that most of these phenomena are rooted in reality. But ought one seriously to allow such a timidconsideration as that to deter one from following the evident path of greatest religious promise? Since when, in thismixed world, was any good thing given us in purest outline and isolation? One of the chief characteristics of life islife's redundancy. The sole condition of our having anything, no matter what, is that we should have so much of it, thatwe are fortunate if we do not grow sick of the sight and sound of it altogether. Everything"},{"pageNumber":821,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP774 hl[01 03 2011 14 05 39]Page 774is smothered in the litter that is fated to accompany it. Without too much you cannot have enough, of anything. Lots ofinferior books, lots of bad statues, lots of dull speeches, of tenth-rate men and women, as a condition of the fewprecious specimens in either kind being realized! The gold-dust comes to birth with the quartz-sand all around it, andthis is as much a condition of religion as of any other excellent possession. There must be extrication; there must becompetition for survival; but the clay matrix and the noble gem must first come into being unsifted. Once extricated,the gem can be examined separately, conceptualized, defined, and insulated. But this process of extrication cannot beshort-circuited—or if it is, you get the thin inferior abstractions which we have seen, either the hollow unreal god ofscholastic theology, or the unintelligible pantheistic monster, instead of the more living divine reality with which itappears certain that empirical methods tend to connect men in imagination.Arrived at this point, I ask you to go back to my first lecture and remember, if you can, what I quoted there from yourown Professor Jacks—what he said about the philosopher himself being taken up into the universe which he isaccounting for. This is the fechnerian as well as the hegelian view, and thus our end rejoins harmoniously ourbeginning. Philosophies are intimate parts of the universe, they express something of its own thought of itself. Aphilosophy may indeed be a most momentous reaction of the universe upon itself. It may, as I said, possess andhandle itself differently in consequence of us philosophers, with our theories, being here; it may trust itself or mistrustitself the more, and, by doing the one or the other, deserve more the trust or the mistrust. What mistrusts itselfdeserves mistrust.This is the philosophy of humanism in the widest sense. Our philosophies swell the current of being, add theircharacter to it. They are part of all that we have met, of all that makes us be. As a French philosopher says, 'Noussommes du réel dans le réel.' Our thoughts determine our acts, and our acts redetermine the previous nature of theworld.Thus does foreignness get banished from our world, and far more so when we take the system of it pluralistically thanwhen we take it monistically. We are indeed internal parts of"},{"pageNumber":822,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP775 hl[01 03 2011 14 06 46]Page 775God and not external creations, on any possible reading of the panpsychic system. Yet because God is not theabsolute, but is himself a part when the system is conceived pluralistically, his functions can be taken as not whollydissimilar to those of the other smaller parts,—as similar to our functions consequently.Having an environment, being in time, and working out a history just like ourselves, he escapes from the foreignnessfrom all that is human, of the static timeless perfect absolute.Remember that one of our troubles with that was its essential foreignness and monstrosity—there really is no otherword for it than that. Its having the all-inclusive form gave to it an essentially heterogeneous nature from ourselves.And this great difference between absolutism and pluralism demands no difference in the universe's material content—it follows from a difference in the form alone. The all-form or monistic form makes the foreignness result, theeach-form or pluralistic form leaves the intimacy undisturbed.No matter what the content of the universe may be, if you only allow that it is many everywhere and always, thatnothing real escapes from having an environment; so far from defeating its rationality, as the absolutists sounanimously pretend, you leave it in possession of the maximum amount of rationality practically attainable by ourminds. Your relations with it, intellectual, emotional, and active, remain fluent and congruous with your own nature'schief demands.It would be a pity if the word 'rationality' were allowed to give us trouble here. It is one of those eulogistic words thatboth sides claim—for almost no one is willing to advertise his philosophy as a system of irrationality. But like most ofthe words which people used eulogistically, the word 'rational' carries too many meanings. The most objective one isthat of the older logic—the connexion between two things is rational when you can infer one from the other, mortalfrom Socrates, e. g.; and you can do that only when they have a quality in common. But this kind of rationality is justthat logic of identity which all disciples of Hegel find insufficient. They supersede it by the higher rationality ofnegation and contradiction and make the notion vague again. Then you get the æsthetic or teleologic kinds ofrationality, saying that"},{"pageNumber":823,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP776 hl[01 03 2011 14 07 53]Page 776whatever fits in any way, whatever is beautiful or good, whatever is purposive or gratifies desire, is rational in so farforth. Then again, according to Hegel, whatever is 'real' is rational. I myself said awhile ago that whatever lets looseany action which we are fond of exerting seems rational. It would be better to give up the word 'rational' altogetherthan to get into a merely verbal fight about who has the best right to keep it.Perhaps the words 'foreignness' and 'intimacy,' which I put forward in my first lecture, express the contrast I insist onbetter than the words 'rationality' and 'irrationality'—let us stick to them, then. I now say that the notion of the 'one'breeds foreignness and that of the 'many' intimacy, for reasons which I have urged at only too great length, and withwhich, whether they convince you or not, I may suppose that you are now well acquainted. But what at bottom ismeant by calling the universe many or by calling it one?Pragmatically interpreted, pluralism or the doctrine that it is many means only that the sundry parts of reality may beexternally related. Everything you can think of, however vast or inclusive, has on the pluralistic view a genuinely'external' environment of some sort or amount. Things are 'with' one another in many ways, but nothing includeseverything, or dominates over everything. The word 'and' trails along after every sentence. Something always escapes.'Ever not quite' has to be said of the best attempts made anywhere in the universe at attaining all-inclusiveness. Thepluralistic world is thus more like a federal republic than like an empire or a kingdom. However much may becollected, however much may report itself as present at any effective centre of consciousness or action, something elseis self-governed and absent and unreduced to unity.Monism, on the other hand, insists that when you come down to reality as such, to the reality of realities, everything ispresent to everything else in one vast instantaneous co-implicated completeness—nothing can in any sense, functionalor substantial, be really absent from anything else, all things interpenetrate and telescope together in the great totalconflux.For pluralism, all that we are required to admit as the"},{"pageNumber":824,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP777 hl[01 03 2011 14 09 01]Page 777constitution of reality is what we ourselves find empirically realized in every minimum of finite life. Briefly it is this,that nothing real is absolutely simple, that every smallest bit of experience is a multum in parvo plurally related, thateach relation is one aspect, character, or function, way of its being taken, or way of its taking something else; and thata bit of reality when actively engaged in one of these relations is not by that very fact engaged in all the other relationssimultaneously. The relations are not all what the French call solidaires with one another. Without losing its identity athing can either take up or drop another thing, like the log I spoke of, which by taking up new carriers and droppingold ones can travel anywhere with a light escort.For monism, on the contrary, everything, whether we realize it or not, drags the whole universe along with itself anddrops nothing. The log starts and arrives with all its carriers supporting it. If a thing were once disconnected, it couldnever be connected again, according to monism. The pragmatic difference between the two systems is thus a definiteone. It is just thus, that if a is once out of sight of b or out of touch with it, or, more briefly, 'out' of it at all, then,according to monism, it must always remain so, they can never get together; whereas pluralism admits that on anotheroccasion they may work together, or in some way be connected again. Monism allows for no such things as 'otheroccasions' in reality—in real or absolute reality, that is.The difference I try to describe amounts, you see, to nothing more than the difference between what I formerly calledthe each-form and the all-form of reality. Pluralism lets things really exist in the each-form or distributively. Monismthinks that the all-form or collective-unit form is the only form that is rational. The all-form allows of no taking upand dropping of connexions, for in the all the parts are essentially and eternally co-implicated. In the each-form, onthe contrary, a thing may be connected by intermediary things, with a thing with which it has no immediate oressential connexion. It is thus at all times in many possible connexions which are not necessarily actualized at themoment. They depend on which actual path of intermediation it may functionally strike into: the word 'or' names agenuine"},{"pageNumber":825,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP778 hl[01 03 2011 14 10 08]Page 778reality. Thus, as I speak here, I may look ahead or to the right or to the left, and in either case the intervening spaceand air and ether enable me to see the faces of a different portion of this audience. My being here is independent ofany one set of these faces.If the each-form be the eternal form of reality no less than it is the form of temporal appearance, we still have acoherent world, and not an incarnate incoherence, as is charged by so many absolutists. Our 'multiverse' still makes a'universe'; for every part, tho it may not be in actual or immediate connexion, is nevertheless in some possible ormediated connexion, with every other part however remote, through the fact that each part hangs together with its verynext neighbors in inextricable interfusion. The type of union, it is true, is different here from the monistic type of all-einheit. It is not a universal co-implication, or integration of all things durcheinander. It is what I call the strung-along type, the type of continuity, continuity, or concatenation. If you prefer greek words, you may call it thesynechistic type. At all events, you see that it forms a definitely conceivable alternative to the through-and-throughunity of all things at once, which is the type opposed to it by monism. You see also that it stands or falls with thenotion I have taken such pains to defend, of the through-and-through union of adjacent minima of experience, of theconfluence of every passing moment of concretely felt experience with its immediately next neighbors. Therecognition of this fact of coalescence of next with next in concrete experience, so that all the insulating cuts we makethere are artificial products of the conceptualizing faculty, is what distinguishes the empiricism which I call 'radical,'from the bugaboo empiricism of the traditional rationalist critics, which (rightly or wrongly) is accused of chopping upexperience into atomistic sensations, incapable of union with one another until a purely intellectual principle hasswooped down upon them from on high and folded them in its own conjunctive categories.Here, then, you have the plain alternative, and the full mystery of the difference between pluralism and monism, asclearly as I can set it forth on this occasion. It packs up into a nutshell:—Is the manyness in oneness that indubitablycharacterizes the world we inhabit, a property only of the"},{"pageNumber":826,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP779 hl[01 03 2011 14 11 15]Page 779absolute whole of things, so that you must postulate that one-enormous-whole indivisibly as the prius of there beingany many at all—in other words, start with the rationalistic block-universe, entire, unmitigated, and complete?—orcan the finite elements have their own aboriginal forms of manyness in oneness, and where they have no immediateoneness still be continued into one another by intermediary terms—each one of these terms being one with its nextneighbors, and yet the total 'oneness' never getting absolutely complete?The alternative is definite. It seems to me, moreover, that the two horns of it make pragmatically different ethicalappeals—at least they may do so, to certain individuals. But if you consider the pluralistic horn to be intrinsicallyirrational, self-contradictory, and absurd, I can now say no more in its defence. Having done what I could in myearlier lectures to break the edge of the intellectualistic reductiones ad absurdum, I must leave the issue in your hands.Whatever I may say, each of you will be sure to take pluralism or leave it, just as your own sense of rationality movesand inclines. The only thing I emphatically insist upon is that it is a fully co-ordinate hypothesis with monism. Thisworld may, in the last resort, be a block-universe; but on the other hand it may be a universe only strung-along, notrounded in and closed. Reality may exist distributively just as it sensibly seems to, after all. On that possibility I doinsist.One's general vision of the probable usually decides such alternatives. They illustrate what I once wrote of as the 'willto believe.' In some of my lectures at Harvard I have spoken of what I call the 'faith-ladder,' as something quitedifferent from the sorites of the logic-books, yet seeming to have an analogous form. I think you will quicklyrecognize in yourselves, as I describe it, the mental process to which I give this name.A conception of the world arises in you somehow, no matter how. Is it true or not? you ask.It might be true somewhere, you say, for it is not self-contradictory.It may be true, you continue, even here and now.It is fit to be true, it would be well if it were true, it ought to be true, you presently feel."},{"pageNumber":827,"pageContent":" Page 780It must be true, something persuasive in you whispers next; and then—as a final result—It shall be held for true, you decide; it shall be as if true, for you.And your acting thus may in certain special cases be a means of making it securely true in the end.Not one step in this process is logical, yet it is the way in which monists and pluralists alike espouse and hold fast totheir visions. It is life exceeding logic, it is the practical reason for which the theoretic reason finds arguments after theconclusion is once there. In just this way do some of us hold to the unfinished pluralistic universe; in just this way doothers hold to the timeless universe eternally complete.Meanwhile the incompleteness of the pluralistic universe, thus assumed and held to as the most probable hypothesis,is also represented by the pluralistic philosophy as being self-reparative through us, as getting its disconnectionsremedied in part by our behavior. 'We use what we are and have, to know; and what we know, to be and have stillmore.1 Thus do philosophy and reality, theory and action, work in the same circle indefinitely.I have now finished these poor lectures, and as you look back on them, they doubtless seem rambling and inconclusiveenough. My only hope is that they may possibly have proved suggestive; and if indeed they have been suggestive ofone point of method, I am almost willing to let all other suggestions go. That point is that it is high time for the basisof discussion in these questions to be broadened and thickened up. It is for that that I have brought in Fechner andBergson, and descriptive psychology and religious experiences, and have ventured even to hint at psychical researchand other wild beasts of the philosophic desert. Owing possibly to the fact that Plato and Aristotle, with theirintellectualism, are the basis of philosophic study here, the Oxford brand of transcendentalism seems to me to haveconfined itself too exclusively to thin logical considerations, that would hold good in all conceivable worlds, worlds ofan empirical constitution1Blondel: Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne, June, 1906, p. 241."},{"pageNumber":828,"pageContent":" Page 781entirely different from ours.

But they cannot be irrelevant; and the philosophy of the future must imitate the sciences in taking them moreand more elaborately into account. I urge some of the younger members of this learned audience to lay this hint toheart. If you can do so effectively, making still more concrete advances upon the path which Fechner and Bergsonhave so enticingly opened up, if you can gather philosophic conclusions of any kind, monistic or pluralistic, from theparticulars of life, I will say, as I now do say, with the cheerfullest of hearts, 'Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,but ring the fuller minstrel in.'"},{"pageNumber":829,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP782 hl[01 03 2011 14 12 24]Page 782Appendix AThe Thing and its Relations1Expreience in its immediacy seems perfectly fluent. The active sense of living which we all enjoy, before reflectionshatters our instinctive world for us, is self-luminous and suggests no paradoxes. Its difficulties are disappointmentsand uncertainties. They are not intellectual contradictions.When the reflective intellect gets at work, however, it discovers incomprehensibilities in the flowing process.Distinguishing its elements and parts, it gives them separate names, and what it thus disjoins it cannot easily puttogether. Pyrrhonism accepts the irrationality and revels in its dialectic elaboration. Other philosophies try, some byignoring, some by resisting, and some by turning the dialectic procedure against itself, negating its first negations, torestore the fluent sense of life again, and let redemption take the place of innocence. The perfection with which anyphilosophy may do this is the measure of its human success and of its importance in philosophic history. In an articleentitled 'A world of pure experience,'2 I tried my own hand sketchily at the problem, resisting certain first steps ofdialectics by insisting in a general way that the immediately experienced conjunctive relations are as real as anythingelse. If my sketch is not to appear too naïf, I must come closer to details, and in the present essay I propose to do so.I'Pure experience' is the name which I gave to the immediate flux of life which furnishes the material to our laterreflection with its conceptual categories. Only new-born babes, or men in semi-coma from sleep, drugs, illnesses, orblows, may be assumed to have an experience pure in the literal sense of a that which is not yet any definite what, thoready to be all1Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, vol. ii, New York, 1905, with slight verbal revision.2Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, vol. i, No. 20, p. 566."},{"pageNumber":830,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP783 hl[01 03 2011 14 13 32]Page 783sorts of whats; full both of oneness and of manyness, but in respects that don't appear; changing throughout, yet soconfusedly that its phases interpenetrate and no points, either of distinction or of identity, can be caught. Pureexperience in this state is but another name for feeling or sensation. But the flux of it no sooner comes than it tends tofill itself with emphases, and these salient parts become identified and fixed and abstracted; so that experience nowflows as if shot through with adjectives and nouns and prepositions and conjunctions. Its purity is only a relative term,meaning the proportional amount of unverbalized sensation which it still embodies.Far back as we go, the flux, both as a whole and in its parts, is that of things conjunct and separated. The greatcontinua of time, space, and the self envelop everything, betwixt them, and flow together without interfering. Thethings that they envelop come as separate in some ways and as continuous in others. Some sensations coalesce withsome ideas, and others are irreconcilable. Qualities compenetrate one space, or exclude each other from it. They clingtogether persistently in groups that move as units, or else they separate. Their changes are abrupt or discontinuous;and their kinds resemble or differ; and, as they do so, they fall into either even or irregular series.In all this the continuities and the discontinuities are absolutely co-ordinate matters of immediate feeling. Theconjunctions are as primordial elements of 'fact' as are the distinctions and disjunctions. In the same act by which Ifeel that this passing minute is a new pulse of my life, I feel that the old life continues into it, and the feeling ofcontinuance in no wise jars upon the simultaneous feeling of a novelty. They, too, compenetrate harmoniously.Prepositions, copulas, and conjunctions, 'is,' 'is n't,' 'then,' 'before,' 'in,' 'on,' 'beside,' 'between,' 'next,' 'like,' 'unlike,' 'as,''but,' flower out of the stream of pure experience, the stream of concretes or the sensational stream, as naturally asnouns and adjectives do, and they melt into it again as fluidly when we apply them to a new portion of the stream.IIIf now we ask why we must translate experience from a"},{"pageNumber":831,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP784 hl[01 03 2011 14 14 39]Page 784more concrete or pure into a more intellectualized form, filling it with ever more abounding conceptual distinctions,rationalism and naturalism give different replies.The rationalistic answer is that the theoretic life is absolute and its interests imperative; that to understand is simplythe duty of man; and that who questions this need not be argued with, for by the fact of arguing he gives away hiscase.The naturalist answer is that the environment kills as well as sustains us, and that the tendency of raw experience toextinguish the experient himself is lessened just in the degree in which the elements in it that have a practical bearingupon life are analyzed out of the continuum and verbally fixed and coupled together, so that we may know what is inthe wind for us and get ready to react in time. Had pure experience, the naturalist says, been always perfectly healthy,there would never have arisen the necessity of isolating or verbalizing any of its terms. We should just haveexperienced inarticulately and unintellectually enjoyed. This leaning on 'reaction' in the naturalist account implies that,whenever we intellectualize a relatively pure experience, we ought to do so for the sake of redescending to the pureror more concrete level again; and that if an intellect stays aloft among its abstract terms and generalized relations, anddoes not reinsert itself with its conclusions into some particular point of the immediate stream of life, it fails to finishout its function and leaves its normal race unrun.Most rationalists nowadays will agree that naturalism gives a true enough account of the way in which our intellectarose at first, but they will deny these latter implications. The case, they will say, resembles that of sexual love.Originating in the animal need of getting another generation born, this passion has developed secondarily suchimperious spiritual needs that, if you ask why another generation ought to be born at all, the answer is: 'Chiefly thatlove may go on.' Just so with our intellect: it originated as a practical means of serving life; but it has developedincidentally the function of understanding absolute truth; and life itself now seems to be given chiefly as a means bywhich that function may be prosecuted. But truth and the understanding of it lie among the abstracts and universals, sothe intellect now carries on its higher business"},{"pageNumber":832,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP785 hl[01 03 2011 14 15 46]Page 785wholly in this region, without any need of redescending into pure experience again.If the contrasted tendencies which I thus designate as naturalistic and rationalistic are not recognized by the reader,perhaps an example will make them more concrete. Mr. Bradley, for instance, is an ultra-rationalist. He admits thatour intellect is primarily practical, but says that, for philosophers, the practical need is simply Truth.1 Truth, moreover,must be assumed 'consistent.' Immediate experience has to be broken into subjects and qualities, terms and relations,to be understood as truth at all. Yet when so broken it is less consistent than ever. Taken raw, it is all undistinguished.Intellectualized, it is all distinction without oneness. 'Such an arrangement may work, but the theoretic problem is notsolved' (p. 23). The question is, 'How the diversity can exist in harmony with the oneness' (p. 118). To go back to pureexperience is unavailing. 'Mere feeling gives no answer to our riddle' (p. 104). Even if your intuition is a fact, it is notan understanding. 'It is a mere experience, and furnishes no consistent view' (pp. 108 109). The experiences offered asfacts or truths 'I find that my intellect rejects because they contradict themselves. They offer a complex of diversitiesconjoined in a way which it feels is not its way and which it cannot repeat as its own. For to be satisfied, my intellectmust understand, and it cannot understand by taking a congeries in the lump' (p. 570). So Mr. Bradley, in the soleinterests of 'understanding' (as he conceives that function), turns his back on finite experience forever. Truth must liein the opposite direction, the direction of the absolute; and this kind of rationalism and naturalism, or (as I will nowcall it) pragmatism, walk thence-forward upon opposite paths. For the one, those intellectual products are most truewhich, turning their face towards the absolute, come nearest to symbolizing its ways of uniting the many and the one.For the other, those are most true which most successfully dip back into the finite stream of feeling and grow mosteasily confluent with some particular wave or wavelet. Such confluence not only proves the intellectual operation tohave been true (as an addition may 'prove' that a1Appearance and Reality, pp. 152 153."},{"pageNumber":833,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP786 hl[01 03 2011 14 16 54]Page 786subtraction is already rightly performed), but it constitutes, according to pragmatism, all that we mean by calling ittrue. Only in so far as they lead us, successfully or unsuccessfully, into sensible experience again, are our abstractsand universals true or false at all.IIIIn Section the 6th of my article, 'A world of pure experience,' I adopted in a general way the common-sense beliefthat one and the same world is cognized by our different minds; but I left undiscussed the dialectical arguments whichmaintain that this is logically absurd. The usual reason given for its being absurd is that it assumes one object (to wit,the world) to stand in two relations at once; to my mind, namely, and again to yours; whereas a term taken in a secondrelation cannot logically be the same term which it was at first.I have heard this reason urged so often in discussing with absolutists, and it would destroy my radical empiricism soutterly, if it were valid, that I am bound to give it an attentive ear, and seriously to search its strength.For instance, let the matter in dispute be a term M, asserted to be on the one hand related to L, and on the other to N;and let the two cases of relation be symbolized by L—M and M—N respectively. When, now, I assume that theexperience may immediately come and be given in the shape L—M—N, with no trace of doubling or internal fissionin the M, I am told that this is all a popular delusion; that L—M—N logically means two different experiences, L—Mand M—N, namely; and that although the absolute may, and indeed must, from its superior point of view, read itsown kind of unity into M's two editions, yet as elements in finite experience the two M's lie irretrievably asunder, andthe world between them is broken and unbridged.In arguing this dialectic thesis, one must avoid slipping from the logical into the physical point of view. It would beeasy, in taking a concrete example to fix one's ideas by, to choose one in which the letter M should stand for acollective noun of some sort, which noun, being related to L by one of its parts and to N by another, would inwardlybe two things when it stood outwardly in both relations. Thus, one might"},{"pageNumber":834,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP787 hl[01 03 2011 14 18 02]Page 787say: 'David Hume, who weighed so many stone by his body, influences posterity by his doctrine.' The body and thedoctrine are two things, between which our finite minds can discover no real sameness, though the same name coversboth of them. And then, one might continue: 'Only an absolute is capable of uniting such a non-identity.' We must, Isay, avoid this sort of example; for the dialectic insight, if true at all, must apply to terms and relations universally. Itmust be true of abstract units as well as of nouns collective; and if we prove it by concrete examples, we must takethe simplest, so as to avoid irrelevant material suggestions.Taken thus in all its generality, the absolutist contention seems to use as its major premise Hume's notion 'that all ourdistinct perceptions are distinct existences, and that the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinctexistences.' Undoubtedly, since we use two phrases in talking first about 'M's relation to L' and then again about 'M'srelation to N,' we must be having, or must have had, two distinct perceptions;—and the rest would then seem tofollow duly. But the starting-point of the reasoning here seems to be the fact of the two phrases; and this suggests thatthe argument may be merely verbal. Can it be that the whole dialectic achievement consists in attributing to theexperience talked-about a constitution similar to that of the language in which we describe it? Must we assert theobjective doubleness of the M merely because we have to name it twice over when we name its two relations?Candidly, I can think of no other reason than this for the dialectic conclusion!1 for, if we think, not of our words, butof any simple concrete matter which they may be held to signify, the experience itself belies the paradox asserted. Weuse indeed two separate concepts in analyzing our object, but we know them all the while to be but substitutional, andthat the M in L—M and the M in M—N mean (i. e., are capable of leading to and terminating in) one self-same piece,M, of sensible experience. This persistent identity of certain units, or emphases, or points, or objects, or members—call them what1Technically, it seems classable as a 'fallacy of composition.'

For samenesses are parts of experience's indefeasible structure. When I hear a bell-stroke and, as lifeflows on, its after-image dies away, I still hark back to it as 'that same bell-stroke.' When I see a thing M, with L tothe left of it and N to the right of it, I see it as one M; and if you tell me I have had to 'take' it twice, I reply that if I'took' it a thousand times, I should still see it as a unit.1 Its unity is aboriginal, just as the multiplicity of my successivetakings is aboriginal. It comes unbroken as that M, as a singular which I encounter; they come broken, as thosetakings, as my plurality of operations. The unity and the separateness are strictly co-ordinate. I do not easily fathomwhy my opponents should find the separateness so much more easily understandable that they must needs infect thewhole of finite experience with it, and relegate the unity (now taken as a bare postulate and no longer as a thingpositively perceivable) to the region of the absolute's mysteries. I do not easily fathom this, I say, for the saidopponents are above mere verbal quibbling; yet all that I can catch in their talk is the substitution of what is true ofcertain words for what is true of what they signify. They stay with the words,—not returning to the stream of lifewhence all the meaning of them came, and which is always ready to reabsorb them.IVFor aught this argument proves, then, we may continue to believe that one thing can be known by many knowers. Butthe denial of one thing in many relations is but one application of a still profounder dialectic difficulty. Man can't begood, said the sophists, for man is man and good is good; and Hegel and Herbart in their day, more recently H. Spir,and most recently and elaborately of all, Mr. Bradley, inform1I may perhaps refer here to my Principles of Psychology, vol. i, pp. 459 ff. It really seems 'weird' to have to argue (as I am forced nowto do) for the notion that it is one sheet of paper (with its two surfaces and all that lies between) which is both under my pen and on thetable while I write—the 'claim' that it is two sheets seems so brazen. Yet I sometimes suspect the absolutists of sincerity!"},{"pageNumber":836,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP789 hl[01 03 2011 14 20 18]Page 789us that a term can logically only be a punctiform unit, and that not one of the conjunctive relations between things,which experience seems to yield, is rationally possible.Of course, if true, this cuts off radical empiricism without even a shilling. Radical empiricism takes conjunctiverelations at their face-value, holding them to be as real as the terms united by them. The world it represents as acollection, some parts of which are conjunctively and others disjunctively related. Two parts, themselves disjoined,may nevertheless hang together by intermediaries with which they are severally connected, and the whole worldeventually may hang together similarly, inasmuch as some path of conjunctive transition by which to pass from one ofits parts to another may always be discernible. Such determinately various hanging-together may be calledconcatenated union, to distinguish it from the 'through-and-through' type of union, 'each in all and all in each' (unionof total conflux, as one might call it), which monistic systems hold to obtain when things are taken in their absolutereality. In a concatenated world a partial conflux often is experienced. Our concepts and our sensations are confluent;successive states of the same ego, and feelings of the same body are confluent. Where the experience is not ofconflux, it may be of conterminousness (things with but one thing between); or of contiguousness (nothing between);or of likeness; or of nearness; or of simultaneousness; or of inness; or of on-ness; or of for-ness; or of simple with-ness; or even of mere and-ness, which last relation would make of however disjointed a world otherwise, at any ratefor that occasion a universe 'of discourse.' Now Mr. Bradley tells us that none of these relations, as we actuallyexperience them, can possibly be real.1 My next duty, accordingly, must be to rescue radical empiricism from Mr.Bradley. Fortunately, as it1Here again the reader must beware of slipping from logical into phenomenal considerations. It may well be that we attribute a certainrelation falsely, because the circumstances of the case, being complex, have deceived us. At a railway station we may take our own train,and not the one that fills our window, to be moving. We here put motion in the wrong place in the world, but in its original place themotion is a part of reality. What Mr. Bradley means is nothing like this, but rather that such things as motion are nowhere real, and that,even in their aboriginal and empirically incorrigible seats, relations are impossible of comprehension."},{"pageNumber":837,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP790 hl[01 03 2011 14 21 26]Page 790seems to me, his general contention, that the very notion of relation is unthinkable clearly, has been successfully metby many critics.1It is a burden to the flesh, and an injustice both to readers and to the previous writers, to repeat good argumentsalready printed. So, in noticing Mr. Bradley, I will confine myself to the interests of radical empiricism solely.VThe first duty of radical empiricism, taking given conjunctions at their face-value, is to class some of them as moreintimate and some as more external. When two terms are similar, their very natures enter into the relation. Being whatthey are, no matter where or when, the likeness never can be denied, if asserted. It continues predicable as long as theterms continue. Other relations, the where and the when, for example, seem adventitious. The sheet of paper may be'off' or 'on' the table, for example; and in either case the relation involves only the outside of its terms. Having anoutside, both of them, they contribute by it to the relation. It is external: the term's inner nature is irrelevant to it. Anybook, any table, may fall into the relation, which is created pro hac vice, not by their existence, but by their casualsituation. It is just because so many of the conjunctions of experience seem so external that a philosophy of pureexperience must tend to pluralism in its ontology. So far as things have space-relations, for example, we are free toimagine them with different origins even. If they could get to be, and get into space at all, then they may have done soseparately. Once there, however, they are additives to one another, and, with no prejudice to their natures, all sorts ofspace-relations may supervene between them. The question of how things could come to be, anyhow, is whollydifferent from the question what their relations, once the being accomplished, may consist in.1Particularly so by Andrew Seth Pringle-Pattison, in his Man and the Cosmos; by L. T. Hobhouse, in chapter xii (the Validity ofJudgment) of his Theory of Knowledge; and by F. C. S. Schiller, in his Humanism, Essay XI. Other fatal reviews (in my opinion) areHodder's, in the Psychological Review, vol. i, 307; Stout's, in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1901-02, p. 1; andMacLennan's, in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., vol. i, 403."},{"pageNumber":838,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP791 hl[01 03 2011 14 22 33]Page 791Mr. Bradley now affirms that such external relations as the space-relations which we here talk of must hold of entirelydifferent subjects from those of which the absence of such relations might a moment previously have been plausiblyasserted. Not only is the situation different when the book is on the table, but the book itself is different as a book,from what it was when it was off the table.1 He admits that 'such external relations seem possible and even existing. That you do not alter what you compare or rearrange in space seems to common sense quite obvious, and that on theother side there are as obvious difficulties does not occur to common sense at all. And I will begin by pointing outthese difficulties. There is a relation in the result, and this relation, we hear, is to make no difference in its terms.But, if so, to what does it make a difference? [does n't it make a difference to us onlookers, at least?] and what is themeaning and sense of qualifying the terms by it? [Surely the meaning is to tell the truth about their relative position.2]If, in short, it is external to the terms, how can it possibly be true of them? [Is it the 'intimacy' suggested by the littleword 'of,' here, which I have underscored, that is the root of Mr. Bradley's trouble?] If the terms from their innernature do not enter into the relation, then, so far as they are concerned, they seem related for no reason at all. Thingsare spatially related, first in one way, and then become related in another way, and yet in no way themselves arealtered; for the relations, it is said, are but external. But I reply that, if so, I cannot understand the leaving by the termsof one set of relations and their adoption of another fresh set. The process and its result to the terms, if1Once more, don't slip from logical into physical situations. Of course, if the table be wet, it will moisten the book, or if it be slightenough and the book heavy enough, the book will break it down. But such collateral phenomena are not the point at issue. The point iswhether the successive relations 'on' and 'not-on' can rationally (not physically) hold of the same constant terms, abstractly taken.Professor A. E. Taylor drops from logical into material considerations when he instances color-contrast as a proof that A, 'as contra-distinguished from B, is not the same thing as mere A not in any way affected' (Elements of Metaphysics, 1903, p. 145). Note thesubstitution, for 'related,' of the word 'affected,' which begs the whole question.2But 'is there any sense,' asks Mr. Bradley, peevishly, on p. 579, 'and if so, what sense, in truth that is only outside and ''about\" things?'Surely such a question may be left unanswered."},{"pageNumber":839,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP792 hl[01 03 2011 14 23 40]Page 792they contribute nothing to it [surely they contribute to it all there is 'of' it!], seem irrational throughout. [If 'irrational'here means simply 'non-rational,' or non-deducible from the essence of either term singly, it is no reproach; if itmeans 'contradicting' such essence, Mr. Bradley should show wherein and how.] But, if they contribute anything, theymust surely be affected internally. [Why so, if they contribute only their surface? In such relations as 'on,' 'a footaway,' 'between,' 'next,' etc., only surfaces are in question.] If the terms contribute anything whatever, then the termsare affected [inwardly altered?] by the arrangement. That for working purposes we treat, and do well to treat, somerelations as external merely, I do not deny, and that of course is not the question at issue here. That question is whether in the end and in principle a mere external relation [i. e., a relation which can change without forcing itsterms to change their nature simultaneously] is possible and forced on us by the facts.'1Mr. Bradley next reverts to the antinomies of space, which, according to him, prove it to be unreal, although it appearsas so prolific a medium of external relations; and he then concludes that 'Irrationality and externality cannot be thelast truth about things. Somewhere there must be a reason why this and that appear together. And this reason andreality must reside in the whole from which terms and relations are abstractions, a whole in which their internalconnexion must lie, and out of which from the background appear those fresh results which never could have comefrom the premises' (p. 577). And he adds that 'Where the whole is different, the terms that qualify and contribute to itmust so far be different. They are altered so far only [how far? farther than externally, yet not through and through?], but still they are altered. I must insist that in each case the terms are qualified by their whole [qualified how?—dotheir external relations, situations, dates, etc., changed as these are in the new whole, fail to qualify them 'far'enough?], and that in the second case there is a whole which differs both logically and psychologically from the firstwhole; and I urge that in contributing to the change the terms so far are altered' (p. 579).1Appearance and Reality, 2d edition, pp. 575 576."},{"pageNumber":840,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP793 hl[01 03 2011 14 24 48]Page 793Not merely the relations, then, but the terms are altered: und zwar 'so far.' But just how far is the whole problem; and'through-and-through' would seem (in spite of Mr. Bradley's somewhat undecided utterances1) to be the full bradleyananswer. The 'whole' which he here treats as primary and determinative of each part's manner of 'contributing,' simplymust, when it alters, alter in its entirety. There must be total conflux of its parts, each into and through each other. The'must' appears here as a Machtspruch, as an ipse dixit of Mr. Bradley's absolutistically tempered 'understanding,' for hecandidly confesses that how the parts do differ as they contribute to different wholes, is unknown to him (p. 578).Although I have every wish to comprehend the authority by which Mr. Bradley's understanding speaks, his wordsleave me wholly unconverted. 'External relations' stand with their withers all unwrung, and remain, for aught heproves to the contrary, not only practically workable, but also perfectly intelligible factors of reality.VIMr. Bradley's understanding shows the most extraordinary power of perceiving separations and the most extraordinaryimpotence in comprehending conjunctions. One would natu-1I say 'undecided,' because, apart from the 'so far,' which sounds terribly half-hearted, there are passages in these very pages in whichMr. Bradley admits the pluralistic thesis. Read, for example, what he says, on p. 578, of a billiard ball keeping its 'character' unchanged,though, in its change of place, its 'existence' gets altered; or what he says, on p. 579, of the possibility that an abstract quality A, B, or C,in a thing, 'may throughout remain unchanged' although the thing be altered; or his admission that in red-hairedness, both as analyzedout of a man and when given with the rest of him, there may be 'no change' (p. 580). Why does he immediately add that for the pluralistto plead the non-mutation of such abstractions would be an ignoratio elenchi? It is impossible to admit it to be such. The entire elenchusand inquest is just as to whether parts which you can abstract from existing wholes can also contribute to other wholes without changingtheir inner nature. If they can thus mould various wholes into new gestaltqualitäten, then it follows that the same elements are logicallyable to exist in different wholes [whether physically able would depend on additional hypotheses]; that partial changes are thinkable, andthrough-and-through change not a dialectic necessity; that monism is only an hypothesis; and that an additively constituted universe is arationally respectable hypothesis also. All the theses of radical empiricism, in short, follow."},{"pageNumber":841,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP794 hl[01 03 2011 14 25 55]Page 794rally say 'neither or both,' but not so Mr. Bradley. When a common man analyzes certain whats from out the stream ofexperience, he understands their distinctness as thus isolated. But this does not prevent him from equally wellunderstanding their combination with each other as originally experienced in the concrete, or their confluence withnew sensible experiences in which they recur as 'the same.' Returning into the stream of sensible presentation, nounsand adjectives, and thats and abstract whats, grow confluent again, and the word 'is' names all these experiences ofconjunction. Mr. Bradley understands the isolation of the abstracts, but to understand the combination is to himimpossible.1 'To understand a complex AB,' he says, 'I must begin with A or B. And beginning, say with A, if I thenmerely find B, I have either lost A, or I have got beside A, [the word 'beside' seems here vital, as meaning aconjunction 'external' and therefore unintelligible] something else, and in neither case have I understood.2 For myintellect cannot simply unite a diversity, nor has it in itself any from or way of togetherness, and you gain nothing if,beside A and B, you offer me their conjunction in fact. For to my intellect that is no more than another externalelement. And \"facts,\" once for all, are for my intellect not true unless they satisfy it. The intellect has in its nature noprinciple of mere togetherness' (pp. 570, 572).Of course Mr. Bradley has a right to define 'intellect' as the power by which we perceive separations but not unions—provided he give due notice to the reader. But why then claim that such a maimed and amputated power must reignsu-1So far as I catch his state of mind, it is somewhat like this: 'Book,' 'table,' 'on'—how does the existence of these three abstract elementsresult in this book being livingly on this table? Why is n't the table on the book? Or why does n't the 'on' connect itself with another book,or something that is not a table? Must n't something in each of the three elements already determine the two others to it, so that they donot settle elsewhere or float vaguely? Must n't the whole fact be prefigured in each part, and exist de jure before it can exist de facto?But, if so, in what can the jural existence consist, if not in a spiritual miniature of the whole fact's constitution actuating every partialfactor as its purpose? But is this anything but the old metaphysical fallacy of looking behind a fact in esse for the ground of the fact, andfinding it in the shape of the very same fact in posse? Somewhere we must leave off with a constitution behind which there is nothing.2Apply this to the case of 'book-on-table'! W. J."},{"pageNumber":842,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP795 hl[01 03 2011 14 27 02]Page 795preme in philosophy, and accuse on its behoof the whole empirical world of irrationality? It is true that he elsewhere(p. 568) attributes to the intellect a proprius motus of transition, but says that when he looks for these transitions inthe detail of living experience, he 'is unable to verify such a solution' (p. 569).Yet he never explains what the intellectual transitions would be like in case we had them. He only defines themnegatively—they are not spatial, temporal, predicative, or causal; or qualitatively or otherwise serial; or in any wayrelational as we naïvely trace relations, for relations separate terms, and need themselves to be hooked on adinfinitum. The nearest approach he makes to describing a truly intellectual transition is where he speaks of A and B asbeing 'united, each from its own nature, in a whole which is the nature of both alike' (p. 570). But this (which, paceMr. Bradley, seems exquisitely analogous to 'taking a congeries in a lump,' if not to 'swamping') suggests nothing butthat conflux which pure experience so abundantly offers, as when 'space,' 'white,' and 'sweet' are confluent in a 'lumpof sugar,' or kinesthetic, dermal, and optical sensations confluent in 'my hand.'1 All that I can verify in the transitionswhich Mr. Bradley's intellect desiderates as its proprius motus is a reminiscence of these and other sensibleconjunctions (especially space-conjunctions), but a reminiscence so vague that its originals are not recognized.Bradley, in short, repeats the fable of the dog, the bone, and its image in the water. With a world of particulars, givenin loveliest union, in conjunction definitely various, and variously definite, the 'how' of which you 'understand' assoon as you see the fact of them,2 for there is no how except the constitution of the fact as given; with all this givenhim, I say, in pure experience, he asks for some ineffable union in the abstract instead, which, if he gained it, wouldonly be a duplicate of1How meaningless is the contention that in such wholes (or in 'book-on-table,' 'watch-in-pocket,' etc.) the relation is an additional entitybetween the terms, needing itself to be related again to each! Both Bradley (Appearance and Reality, pp. 32 33) and Royce (The Worldand the Individual, i, 128) lovingly repeat this piece of profundity.2The 'why' and the 'whence' are entirely other questions, not under discussion, as I understand Mr. Bradley. Not how experience gets itselfborn, but how it can be what it is after it is born, is the puzzle."},{"pageNumber":843,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP796 hl[01 03 2011 14 28 09]Page 796what he has already in his full possession. Surely he abuses the privilege which society grants to all of usphilosophers, of being puzzle-headed.Polemic writing like this is odious; but with absolutism in possession in so many quarters, omission to defend myradical empiricism against its best known champion would count as either superficiality or inability. I have toconclude that its dialectic has not invalidated in the least degree the usual conjunctions by which the world, asexperienced, hangs so variously together. In particular it leaves an empirical theory of knowledge intact, and lets uscontinue to believe with common sense that one object may be known, if we have any ground for thinking that it isknown, to many knowers."},{"pageNumber":844,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP797 hl[01 03 2011 14 29 17]Page 797Appendix BThe Experience of Activity1 Mr. Bradley calls the question of activity a scandal to philosophy, and if one turns to the current literature of thesubject—his own writings included—one easily gathers what he means. The opponents cannot even understand oneanother. Mr. Bradley says to Mr. Ward: 'I do not care what your oracle is, and your preposterous psychology may herebe gospel if you please; but if the revelation does contain a meaning, I will commit myself to this: either the oracle isso confused that its signification is not discoverable, or, upon the other hand, if it can be pinned down to any definitestatement, then that statement will be false.'2 Mr. Ward in turn says of Mr. Bradley: 'I cannot even imagine the state ofmind to which his description applies. It reads like an unintentional travesty of Herbartian Psychology by one whohas tried to improve upon it without being at the pains to master it.' Münsterberg excludes a view opposed to his ownby saying that with any one who holds it a verständigung with him is 'grundsätzlich ausgeschlossen'; and Royce, in areview of Stout,3 hauls him over the coals at great length for defending 'efficacy' in a way which I, for one, nevergathered from reading him, and which I have heard Stout himself say was quite foreign to the intention of his text.In these discussions distinct questions are habitually jumbled and different points of view are talked of durcheinander.(1) There is a psychological question: Have we perceptions of activity? and if so, what are they like, and when andwhere do we have them?(2) There is a metaphysical question: Is there a fact of activity? and if so, what idea must we frame of it? What is it1President's Address before the American Psychological Association, December, 1904.

S., VI, 379."},{"pageNumber":845,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP798 hl[01 03 2011 14 30 24]Page 798like? and what does it do, if it does anything? And finally there is a logical question:(3) Whence do we know activity? By our own feelings of it solely? or by some other source of information?Throughout page after page of the literature one knows not which of these questions is before one; and meredescription of the surface-show of experience is proffered as if it implicitly answered every one of them. No one ofthe disputants, moreover, tries to show what pragmatic consequences his own view would carry, or what assignableparticular differences in any one's experience it would make if his adversary's were triumphant.It seems to me that if radical empiricism be good for anything, it ought, with its pragmatic method and its principle ofpure experience, to be able to avoid such tangles, or at least to simplify them somewhat. The pragmatic method startsfrom the postulate that there is no difference of truth that does n't make a difference of fact somewhere; and it seeks todetermine the meaning of all differences of opinion by making the discussion hinge as soon as possible upon somepractical or particular issue. The principle of pure experience is also a methodical postulate. Nothing shall be admittedas fact, it says, except what can be experienced at some definite time by some experient; and for every feature of factever so experienced, a definite place must be found somewhere in the final system of reality. In other words:Everything real must be experienceable somewhere, and every kind of thing experienced must somewhere be real.Armed with these rules of method, let us see what face the problems of activity present to us.By the principle of pure experience, either the word 'activity' must have no meaning at all, or else the original type andmodel of what it means must lie in some concrete kind of experience that can be definitely pointed out. Whateverulterior judgments we may eventually come to make regarding activity, that sort of thing will be what the judgmentsare about. The first step to take, then, is to ask where in the stream of experience we seem to find what we speak of asactivity. What we are to think of the activity thus found will be a later question.Now it is obvious that we are tempted to affirm activity"},{"pageNumber":846,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP799 hl[01 03 2011 14 31 31]Page 799wherever we find anything going on. Taken in the broadest sense, any apprehension of something doing, is anexperience of activity. Were our world describable only by the words 'nothing happening,' 'nothing changing,' 'nothingdoing,' we should unquestionably call it an 'inactive' world. Bare activity, then, as we may call it, means the bare factof event or change. 'Change taking place' is a unique content of experience, one of those 'conjunctive' objects whichradical empiricism seeks so earnestly to rehabilitate and preserve. The sense of activity is thus in the broadest andvaguest way synonymous with the sense of 'life.' We should feel our own subjective life at least, even in noticing andproclaiming an otherwise inactive world. Our own reaction on its monotony would be the one thing experienced therein the form of something coming to pass.This seems to be what certain writers have in mind when they insist that for an experient to be at all is to be active. Itseems to justify, or at any rate to explain, Mr. Ward's expression that we are only as we are active,1 for we are onlyas experients; and it rules out Mr. Bradley's contention that 'there is no original experience of anything like activity.'What we ought to say about activities thus simply given, whose they are, what they effect, or whether indeed theyeffect anything at all—these are later questions, to be answered only when the field of experience is enlarged.Bare activity would thus be predicable, though there were no definite direction, no actor, and no aim. Mere restlesszigzag movement, or a wild ideenflucht, or rhapsodie der wahrnehmungen, as Kant would say, would constitute anactive as distinguished from an inactive world.But in this actual world of ours, as it is given, a part at least of the activity comes with definite direction; it comeswith desire and sense of goal; it comes complicated with resistances which it overcomes or succumbs to, and with theefforts which the feeling of resistance so often provokes; and it is in complex experiences like these that the notions ofdistinct agents, and of passivity as opposed to activity arise. Here also the notion of causal efficacy comes to birth.Perhaps the most1Naturalism and Agnosticism, vol. ii, p. 245.

In their descriptions, exquisitely subtle some of them,1 the activity appears as thegestaltqualität or the fundirte inhalt (or as whatever else you may please to call the conjunctive form) which thecontent falls into when we experience it in the ways which the describers set forth. Those factors in those relations arewhat we mean by activity-situations; and to the possible enumeration and accumulation of their circumstances andingredients there would seem to be no natural bound. Every hour of human life could contribute to the picture gallery;and this is the only fault that one can find with such descriptive industry—where is it going to stop? Ought we tolisten forever to verbal pictures of what we have already in concrete form in our own breasts?2 They never take us offthe superficial plane. We knew the facts already—less spread out and separated, to be sure—but we knew them still.We always felt our own activity, for example, as 'the expansion of an idea with which our Self is identified, against anobstacle'; and the following out of such a definition through a multitude of cases elaborates the obvious so as to belittle more than an exercise in synonymic speech.All the descriptions have to trace familiar outlines, and to use familiar terms. The activity is, for example, attributedeither to a physical or to a mental agent, and is either aimless or directed. If directed, it shows tendency. The tendencymay or may not be resisted. If not, we call the activity immanent, as when a body moves in empty space by itsmomentum, or our thoughts wander at their own sweet will. If resistance is met, its agent complicates the situation. Ifnow, in spite of resistance, the original tendency continues, effort makes its appearance, and along with effort, strainor squeeze. Will, in the narrower sense of the word, then comes upon the scene, whenever, along with the tendency,the strain and squeeze are1Their existence forms a curious commentary on Professor Münsterberg's dogma that will-attitudes are not describable. He himself hascontributed in a superior way to their description, both in his Willenshandlung, and in his Grundzüge, Part II, chap. ix, § 7.2I ought myself to cry peccavi, having been a voluminous sinner in my own chapter on the will."},{"pageNumber":848,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP801 hl[01 03 2011 14 33 46]Page 801sustained. But the resistance may be great enough to check the tendency, or even to reverse its path. In that case, we(if 'we' were the original agents or subjects of the tendency) are overpowered. The phenomenon turns into one oftension simply, or of necessity succumbed-to, according as the opposing power is only equal, or is superior toourselves.Whosoever describes an experience in such terms as these, describes an experience of activity. If the word have anymeaning, it must denote what there is found. There is complete activity in its original and first intention. What it is'known-as' is what there appears. The experiencer of such a situation possesses all that the idea contains. He feels thetendency, the obstacle, the will, the strain, the triumph, or the passive giving up, just as he feels the time, the space,the swiftness or intensity, the movement, the weight and color, the pain and pleasure, the complexity, or whateverremaining characters the situation may involve. He goes through all that ever can be imagined where activity issupposed. If we suppose activities to go on outside of our experience, it is in forms like these that we must supposethem, or else give them some other name; for the word 'activity' has no imaginable content whatever save theseexperiences of process, obstruction, striving, strain, or release, ultimate qualia as they are of the life given us to beknown.Were this the end of the matter, one might think that whenever we had successfully lived through an activity-situationwe should have to be permitted, without provoking contradiction, to say that we had been really active, that we hadmet real resistance and had really prevailed. Lotze somewhere says that to be an entity all that is necessary is to geltenas an entity, to operate, or be felt, experienced, recognized, or in any way realized, as such. In our activity-experiences the activity assuredly fulfils Lotze's demand. It makes itself gelten. It is witnessed at its work. No matterwhat activities there may really be in this extraordinary universe of ours, it is impossible for us to conceive of any oneof them being either lived through or authentically known otherwise than in this dramatic shape of somethingsustaining a felt purpose against felt obstacles and overcoming or being overcome. What 'sustaining' means here isclear to any one who has lived through"},{"pageNumber":849,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP802 hl[01 03 2011 14 34 54]Page 802the experience, but to no one else; just as 'loud,' 'red,' 'sweet,' mean something only to beings with ears, eyes, andtongues. The percipi in these originals of experience is the esse; the curtain is the picture. If there is anything hiding inthe background, it ought not to be called activity, but should get itself another name.This seems so obviously true that one might well experience astonishment at finding so many of the ablest writers onthe subject flatly denying that the activity we live through in these situations is real. Merely to feel active is not to beactive, in their sight. The agents that appear in the experience are not real agents, the resistances do not really resist,the effects that appear are not really effects at all.1 It is evident from this that mere descriptive analysis of any one ofour activity-experiences is not the whole story, that there is something still to tell about them that has led such ablewriters to conceive of a Simon-pure activity, of an activity an sich, that does, and does n't merely appear to us to do,and compared with whose real doing all this phenomenal activity is but a specious sham.1Verborum gratiâ: 'The feeling of activity is not able, quâ feeling, to tell us anything about activity' (Loveday: Mind, N. S., X., 463); 'Asensation or feeling or sense of activity is not, looked at in another way, a feeling of activity at all. It is a mere sensation shut up withinwhich you could by no reflection get the idea of activity. Whether this experience is or is not later on a character essential to ourperception and our idea of activity, it, as it comes first, is not in itself an experience of activity at all. It, as it comes first, is only so forextraneous reasons and only so for an outside observer' (Bradley, Appearance and Reality, 2d edition, p. 605); 'In dem tätigkeitsgefühleleigh an sich nicht der geringste beweis für das vorhandensein einer psychischen tätigkeit' (Münsterberg: Grundzüge, etc., p. 67). I couldmultiply similar quotations, and would have introduced some of them into my text to make it more concrete, save that the mingling ofdifferent points of view in most of these author's discussions (not in Münsterberg's) make it impossible to disentangle exactly what theymean. I am sure in any case to be accused of misrepresenting them totally, even in this note, by omission of the context, so the less Iname names and the more I stick to abstract characterization of a merely possible style of opinion, the safer it will be. And apropos ofmisunderstandings, I may add to this note a complaint on my own account. Professor Stout, in the excellent chapter on 'Mental Activity,'in vol. i of his Analytic Psychology, takes me to task for identifying spiritual activity with certain muscular feelings, and gives quotationsto bear him out. They are from certain paragraphs on 'the Self,' in which my attempt was to show what the central nucleus of theactivities that we call 'ours' is. I found it in certain intracephalic movements which we habitually oppose, as 'sub-(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":850,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP803 hl[01 03 2011 14 36 01]Page 803The metaphysical question opens here; and I think that the state of mind of one possessed by it is often something(Footnote continued from previous page)jective,' to the activities of the transcorporeal world. I sought to show that there is no direct evidence that we feel the activity of an innerspiritual agent as such (I should now say the activity of 'consciousness' as such, see my paper 'Does consciousness exist?' in the Journalof Philosophy, vol. i, p. 477). There are, in fact, three distinguishable 'activities' in the field of discussion: the elementary activityinvolved in the mere that of experience, in the fact that something is going on, and the farther specification of this something into twowhats, an activity felt as 'ours,' and an activity ascribed to objects. Stout, as I apprehend him, identifies 'our' activity with that of the totalexperience-process, and when I circumscribe it as a part thereof, accuses me of treating it as a sort of external appendage to itself (pp.162 163), as if I 'separated the activity from the process which is active.' But all the processes in question are active, and their activity isinseparable from their being. My book raised only the question of which activity deserved the name of 'ours.' So far as we are 'persons,'and contrasted and opposed to an 'environment,' movements in our body figure as our activities; and I am unable to find any otheractivities that are ours in this strictly personal sense. There is a wider sense in which the whole 'choir of heaven and furniture of theearth,' and their activities, are ours, for they are our 'objects.' But 'we' are here only another name for the total process of experience,another name for all that is, in fact; and I was dealing with the personal and individualized self exclusively in the passages with whichProfessor Stout finds fault.The individualized self, which I believe to be the only thing properly called self, is a part of the content of the world experienced. The worldexperienced (otherwise called the 'field of consciousness') comes at all times with our body as its centre, centre of vision, centre of action,centre of interest. Where the body is is 'here'; when the body acts is 'now'; what the body touches is 'this'; all other things are 'there' and 'then'and 'that.' These words of emphasized position imply a systematization of things with reference to a focus of action and interest which lies inthe body; and the systematization is now so instinctive (was it ever not so?) that no developed or active experience exists for us at all exceptin that ordered form. So far as 'thoughts' and 'feelings' can be active, their activity terminates in the activity of the body, and only through firstarousing its activities can they begin to change those of the rest of the world. The body is the storm centre, the origin of co-ordinates, theconstant place of stress in all that experience-train. Everything circles round it, and is felt from its point of view. The word 'I,' then, isprimarily a noun of position, just like 'this' and 'here.' Activities attached to 'this' position have prerogative emphasis, and, if activities havefeelings, must be felt in a peculiar way. The word 'my' designates the kind of emphasis. I see no inconsistency whatever in defending, on theone hand, 'my' activities as unique and opposed to those of outer nature, and, on the other hand, in affirming, after introspection, that theyconsist in movements in the head. The 'my' of them is the emphasis, the feeling of perspective-interest in which they are dyed."},{"pageNumber":851,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP804 hl[01 03 2011 14 37 09]Page 804like this: 'It is all very well,' we may imagine him saying, 'to talk about certain experience-series taking on the form offeelings of activity, just as they might take on musical or geometric forms. Suppose that they do so; suppose that whatwe feel is a will to stand a strain. Does our feeling do more than record the fact that the strain is sustained? The realactivity, meanwhile, is the doing of the fact; and what is the doing made of before the record is made? What in thewill enables it to act thus? And these trains of experience themselves, in which activities appear, what makes them goat all? Does the activity in one bit of experience bring the next bit into being? As an empiricist you cannot say so, foryou have just declared activity to be only a kind of synthetic object, or conjunctive relation experienced between bitsof experience already made. But what made them at all? What propels experience überhaupt into being? There is theactivity that operates; the activity felt is only its superficial sign.'To the metaphysical question, popped upon us in this way, I must pay serious attention ere I end my remarks, but,before doing so, let me show that without leaving the immediate reticulations of experience, or asking what makesactivity itself act, we still find the distinction between less real and more real activities forced upon us, and are drivento much soul-searching on the purely phenomenal plane.We must not forget, namely, in talking of the ultimate character of our activity-experiences, that each of them is but aportion of a wider world, one link in the vast chain of processes of experience out of which history is made. Eachpartial process, to him who lives through it, defines itself by its origin and its goal; but to an observer with a widermind-span who should live outside of it, that goal would appear but as a provisional halting-place, and thesubjectively felt activity would be seen to continue into objective activities that led far beyond. We thus acquire ahabit, in discussing activity-experiences, of defining them by their relation to something more. If an experience be oneof narrow span, it will be mistaken as to what activity it is and whose. You think that you are acting while you areonly obeying some one's push. You think you are doing this, but you are doing something of which you do not dream.For instance, you think you are but drinking this"},{"pageNumber":852,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP805 hl[01 03 2011 14 38 17]Page 805glass; but you are really creating the liver-cirrhosis that will end your days. You think you are just driving thisbargain, but, as Stevenson says somewhere, you are laying down a link in the policy of mankind.Generally speaking, the onlooker, with his wider field of vision, regards the ultimate outcome of an activity as what itis more really doing; and the most previous agent ascertainable, being the first source of action, he regards as the mostreal agent in the field. The others but transmit that agent's impulse; on him we put responsibility; we name him whenone asks us, 'Who's to blame?'But the most previous agents ascertainable, instead of being of longer span, are often of much shorter span than theactivity in view. Brain-cells are our best example. My brain-cells are believed to excite each other from next to next(by contiguous transmission of katabolic alteration, let us say), and to have been doing so long before this presentstretch of lecturing-activity on my part began. If any one cell-group stops its activity, the lecturing will cease or showdisorder of form. Cessante causa, cessat et effectus—does not this look as if the short-span brain activities were themore real activities, and the lecturing activities on my part only their effects? Moreover, as Hume so clearly pointedout, in my mental activity-situation the words physically to be uttered are represented as the activity's immediate goal.These words, however, cannot be uttered without intermediate physical processes in the bulb and vagi nerves, whichprocesses nevertheless fail to figure in the mental activity-series at all. That series, therefore, since it leaves out vitallyreal steps of action, cannot represent the real activities. It is something purely subjective; the facts of activity areelsewhere. They are something far more interstitial, so to speak, than what my feelings record.The real facts of activity that have in point of fact been systematically pleaded for by philosophers have, so far as myinformation goes, been of three principal types.The first type takes a consciousness of wider time-span than ours to be the vehicle of the more real activity. Its will isthe agent, and its purpose is the action done.The second type assumes that 'ideas' struggling with one"},{"pageNumber":853,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP806 hl[01 03 2011 14 39 24]Page 806another are the agents, and that the prevalence of one set of them is the action.The third type believes that nerve-cells are the agents, and that resultant motor discharges are the acts achieved.Now if we must de-realize our immediately felt activity-situations for the benefit of either of these types of substitute,we ought to know what the substitution practically involves. What practical difference ought it to make if, instead ofsaying naïvely that 'I' am active now in delivering this address, I say that a wider thinker is active, or that certainideas are active, or that certain nerve-cells are active, in producing the result?This would be the pragmatic meaning of the three hypotheses. Let us take them in succession in seeking a reply.If we assume a wider thinker, it is evident that his purposes envelop mine. I am really lecturing for him; and altho Icannot surely know to what end, yet if I take him religiously, I can trust it to be a good end, and willingly connive. Ican be happy in thinking that my activity transmits his impulse, and that his ends prolong my own. So long as I takehim religiously, in short, he does not de-realize my activities. He tends rather to corroborate the reality of them, solong as I believe both them and him to be good.When now we turn to ideas, the case is different, inasmuch as ideas are supposed by the association psychology toinfluence each other only from next to next. The 'span' of an idea, or pair of ideas, is assumed to be much smallerinstead of being larger than that of my total conscious field. The same results may get worked out in both cases, forthis address is being given anyhow. But the ideas supposed to 'really' work it out had no prevision of the whole of it;and if I was lecturing for an absolute thinker in the former case, so, by similar reasoning, are my ideas now lecturingfor me, that is, accomplishing unwittingly a result which I approve and adopt. But, when this passing lecture is over,there is nothing in the bare notion that ideas have been its agents that would seem to guarantee that my presentpurposes in lecturing will be prolonged. I may have ulterior developments in view; but there is no certainty that myideas as such will wish to, or be able to, work them out.The like is true if nerve-cells be the agents. The activity of"},{"pageNumber":854,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP807 hl[01 03 2011 14 40 31]Page 807a nerve-cell must be conceived of as a tendency of exceedingly short reach, an 'impulse' barely spanning the way tothe next cell—for surely that amount of actual 'process' must be 'experienced' by the cells if what happens betweenthem is to deserve the name of activity at all. But here again the gross resultant, as I perceive it, is indifferent to theagents, and neither wished or willed or foreseen. Their being agents now congruous with my will gives me noguarantee that like results will recur again from their activity. In point of fact, all sorts of other results do occur. Mymistakes, impotencies, perversions, mental obstructions, and frustrations generally, are also results of the activity ofcells. Altho these are letting me lecture now, on other occasions they make me do things that I would willingly not do.The question Whose is the real activity? is thus tantamount to the question What will be the actual results? Its interestis dramatic; how will things work out? If the agents are of one sort, one way; if of another sort, they may work outvery differently. The pragmatic meaning of the various alternatives, in short, is great. It makes more than a merelyverbal difference which opinion we take up.You see it is the old dispute come back! Materialism and teleology; elementary short-span actions summingthemselves 'blindly,' or far foreseen ideals coming with effort into act.Naïvely we believe, and humanly and dramatically we like to believe, that activities both of wider and of narrowerspan are at work in life together, that both are real, and that the long-span tendencies yoke the others in their service,encouraging them in the right direction, and damping them when they tend in other ways. But how to represent clearlythe modus operandi of such steering of small tendencies by large ones is a problem which metaphysical thinkers willhave to ruminate upon for many years to come. Even if such control should eventually grow clearly picturable, thequestion how far it is successfully exerted in this actual world can be answered only by investigating the details offact. No philosophic knowledge of the general nature and constitution of tendencies, or of the relation of larger tosmaller ones, can help us to predict which of all the various competing tendencies that interest us in this universe arelikeliest to prevail. We"},{"pageNumber":855,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP808 hl[01 03 2011 14 41 38]Page 808know as an empirical fact that far-seeing tendencies often carry out their purpose, but we know also that they are oftendefeated by the failure of some contemptibly small process on which success depends. A little thrombus in astatesman's meningeal artery will throw an empire out of gear. Therefore I cannot even hint at any solution of thepragmatic issue. I have only wished to show you that that issue is what gives the real interest to all inquiries into whatkinds of activity may be real. Are the forces that really act in the world more foreseeing or more blind? As between'our' activities as 'we' experience them, and those of our ideas, or of our brain-cells, the issue is well defined.I said awhile back (p. 804) that I should return to the 'metaphysical' question before ending; so, with a few wordsabout that, I will now close my remarks.In whatever form we hear this question propounded, I think that it always arises from two things, a belief thatcausality must be exerted in activity, and a wonder as to how causality is made. If we take an activity-situation at itsface-value, it seems as if we caught in flagrante delicto the very power that makes facts come and be. I now ameagerly striving, for example, to get this truth which I seem half to perceive, into words which shall make it showmore clearly. If the words come, it will seem as if the striving itself had drawn or pulled them into actuality out fromthe state of merely possible being in which they were. How is this feat performed? How does the pulling pull? Howdo I get my hold on words not yet existent, and when they come, by what means have I made them come? Really it isthe problem of creation; for in the end the question is: How do I make them be? Real activities are those that reallymake things be, without which the things are not, and with which they are there. Activity, so far as we merely feel it,on the other hand, is only an impression of ours, it may be maintained; and an impression is, for all this way ofthinking, only a shadow of another fact.Arrived at this point, I can do little more than indicate the"},{"pageNumber":856,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP809 hl[01 03 2011 14 42 45]Page 809principles on which, as it seems to me, a radically empirical philosophy is obliged to rely in handling such a dispute.If there be real creative activities in being, radical empiricism must say, somewhere they must be immediately lived.Somewhere the that of efficacious causing and the what of it must be experienced in one, just as the what and the thatof 'cold' are experienced in one whenever a man has the sensation of cold here and now. It boots not to say that oursensations are fallible. They are indeed; but to see the thermometer contradict us when we say 'it is cold' does notabolish cold as a specific nature from the universe. Cold is in the arctic circle if not here. Even so, to feel that ourtrain is moving when the train beside our window moves, to see the moon through a telescope come twice as near, orto see two pictures as one solid when we look through a stereoscope at them, leaves motion, nearness, and soliditystill in being—if not here, yet each in its proper seat elsewhere. And wherever the seat of real causality is, asultimately known 'for true' (in nerve-processes, if you will, that cause our feelings of activity as well as the movementswhich these seem to prompt), a philosophy of pure experience can consider the real causation as no other nature ofthing than that which even in our most erroneous experiences appears to be at work. Exactly what appears there iswhat we mean by working, tho we may later come to learn that working was not exactly there. Sustaining,persevering, striving, paying with effort as we go, hanging on, and finally achieving our intention—this is action, thisis effectuation in the only shape in which, by a pure experience-philosophy, the whereabouts of it anywhere can bediscussed. Here is creation in its first intention, here is causality at work.1 To treat this offhand as the bare illusorysurface of a1Let me not be told that this contradicts a former article of mine, 'Does consciousness exist?' in the Journal of Philosophy for September1, 1904 (see especially page 489), in which it was said that while 'thoughts' and 'things' have the same natures, the natures work'energetically' on each other in the things (fire burns, water wets, etc.), but not in the thoughts. Mental activity-trains are composed ofthoughts, yet their members do work on each other: they check, sustain, and introduce. They do so when the activity is merelyassociational as well as when effort is there. But, and this is my reply, they(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":857,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP810 hl[01 03 2011 14 43 53]Page 810world whose real causality is an unimaginable ontological principle hidden in the cubic deeps, is, for the moreempirical way of thinking, only animism in another shape. You explain your given fact by your 'principle,' but theprinciple itself, when you look clearly at it, turns out to be nothing but a previous little spiritual copy of the fact.Away from that one and only kind of fact your mind, considering causality, can never get.1I conclude, then, that real effectual causation as an ultimate nature, as a 'category,' if you like, of reality, is just whatwe feel it to be, just that kind of conjunction which our own activity-series reveal. We have the whole butt and beingof it in(Footnote continued from previous page)do so by other parts of their nature than those that energize physically. One thought in every developed activity-series is a desire orthought of purpose, and all the other thoughts acquire a feeling tone from their relation of harmony or oppugnancy to this. The interplayof these secondary tones (among which 'interest,' 'difficulty,' and 'effort' figure) runs the drama in the mental series. In what we term thephysical drama these qualities play absolutely no part. The subject needs careful working out; but I can see no inconsistency.1I have found myself more than once accused in print of being the assertor of a metaphysical principle of activity. Since literarymisunderstandings retard the settlement of problems, I should like to say that such an interpretation of the pages I have published on effortand on will is absolutely foreign to what I meant to express. I owe all my doctrines on this subject to Renouvier; and Renouvier, as Iunderstand him, is (or at any rate then was) an out and out phenomenist, a denier of 'forces' in the most strenuous sense. Single clauses in mywriting, or sentences read out of their connexion, may possibly have been compatible with a transphenomenal principle of energy; but I defyany one to show a single sentence which, taken with its context, should be naturally held to advocate that view. The misinterpretationprobably arose at first from my having defended (after Renouvier) the indeterminism of our efforts. 'Free will' was supposed by my critics toinvolve a supernatural agent. As a matter of plain history, the only 'free will' I have ever thought of defending is the character of novelty infresh activity-situations. If an activity-process is the form of a whole 'field of consciousness,' and if each field of consciousness is not only inits totality unique (as is now commonly admitted), but has its elements unique (since in that situation they are all dyed in the total), thennovelty is perpetually entering the world and what happens there is not pure repetition, as the dogma of the literal uniformity of naturerequires. Activity-situations come, in short, each with an original touch. A 'principle' of free will, if there were one, would doubtless manifestitself in such phenomena, but I never saw, nor do I now see, what the principle could do except rehearse the phenomenon beforehand, or whyit ever should be invoked."},{"pageNumber":858,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP811 hl[01 03 2011 14 45 00]Page 811our hands; and the healthy thing for philosophy is to leave off grubbing underground for what effects effectuation, orwhat makes action act, and to try to solve the concrete questions of where effectuation in this world is located, ofwhich things are the true causal agents there, and of what the more remote effects consist.From this point of view the greater sublimity traditionally attributed to the metaphysical inquiry, the grubbing inquiry,entirely disappears. If we could know what causation really and transcendentally is in itself, the only use of theknowledge would be to help us to recognize an actual cause when we had one, and so to track the future course ofoperations more intelligently out. The mere abstract inquiry into causation's hidden nature is not more sublime thanany other inquiry equally abstract. Causation inhabits no more sublime level than anything else. It lives, apparently, inthe dirt of the world as well as in the absolute, or in man's unconquerable mind. The worth and interest of the worldconsists not in its elements, be these elements things, or be they the conjunctions of things; it exists rather in thedramatic outcome of the whole process, and in the meaning of the succession stages which the elements work out.My colleague and master, Josiah Royce, in a page of his review of Stout's Analytic Psychology, in Mind for 1897, hassome fine words on this point with which I cordially agree. I cannot agree with his separating the notion of efficacyfrom that of activity altogether (this I understand to be one contention of his), for activities are efficacious wheneverthey are real activities at all. But the inner nature both of efficacy and of activity are superficial problems, I understandRoyce to say; and the only point for us in solving them would be their possible use in helping us to solve the fardeeper problem of the course and meaning of the world of life. Life, says our colleague, is full of significance, ofmeaning, of success and of defeat, of hoping and of striving, of longing, of desire, and of inner value. It is a totalpresence that embodies worth. To live our own lives better in this presence is the true reason why we wish to knowthe elements of things; so even we psychologists must end on this pragmatic note.The urgent problems of activity are thus more concrete."},{"pageNumber":859,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP812 hl[01 03 2011 14 46 07]Page 812They all are problems of the true relation of longer-span to shorter-span activities. When, for example, a number of'ideas' (to use the name traditional in psychology) grow confluent in a larger field of consciousness, do the smalleractivities still coexist with the wider activities then experienced by the conscious subject? And, if so, do the wideactivities accompany the narrow ones inertly, or do they exert control? Or do they perhaps utterly supplant and replacethem and short-circuit their effects? Again, when a mental activity-process and a brain-cell series of activities bothterminate in the same muscular movement, does the mental process steer the neural processes or not? Or, on the otherhand, does it independently short-circuit their effects? Such are the questions that we must begin with. But so far am Ifrom suggesting any definitive answer to such questions, that I hardly yet can put them clearly. They lead, however,into that region of panpsychic and ontologic speculation of which Professors Bergson and Strong have lately enlargedthe literature in so able and interesting a way. The results of these authors seem in many respects dissimilar, and Iunderstand them as yet but imperfectly; but I cannot help suspecting that the direction of their work is very promising,and that they have the hunter's instinct for the fruitful trails."},{"pageNumber":860,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP813 hl[01 03 2011 14 47 14]Page 813Appendix COn the Notion of Reality as ChangingIn my Principles of Psychology (vol. ii, p. 646) I gave the name of the 'axiom of skipped intermediaries andtransferred relations' to a serial principle of which the foundation of logic, the dictum de omni et nullo (or, as Iexpressed it, the rule that what is of a kind is of that kind's kind), is the most familiar instance. More than the more ismore than the less, equals of equals are equal, sames of the same are the same, the cause of a cause is the cause of itseffects, are other examples of this serial law. Altho it applies infallibly and without restriction throughout certainabstract series, where the 'sames,' 'causes,' etc., spoken of, are 'pure,' and have no properties save their sameness,causality, etc., it cannot be applied offhand to concrete objects with numerous properties and relations, for it is hard totrace a straight line of sameness, causation, or whatever it may be, through a series of such objects without swervinginto some 'respect' where the relation, as pursued originally, no longer holds: the objects have so many 'aspects' thatwe are constantly deflected from our original direction, and find, we know not why, that we are following somethingdifferent from what we started with. Thus a cat is in a sense the same as a mouse-trap, and a mouse-trap the same as abird-cage; but in no valuable or easily intelligible sense is a cat the same as a bird-cage. Commodore Perry was in asense the cause of the new régime in Japan, and the new régime was the cause of the russian Douma; but it wouldhardly profit us to insist on holding to Perry as the cause of the Douma: the terms have grown too remote to have anyreal or practical relation to each other. In every series of real terms, not only do the terms themselves and theirassociates and environments change, but we change, and their meaning for us changes, so that new kinds of samenessand types of causation continually come into view and appeal to our interest. Our earlier lines, having grownirrelevant, are then dropped. The old terms can no longer be substituted nor the relations 'transferred,' because of somany new dimensions into which experience has opened. Instead"},{"pageNumber":861,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP814 hl[01 03 2011 14 48 22]Page 814of a straight line, it now follows a zigzag; and to keep it straight, one must do violence to its spontaneousdevelopment. Not that one might not possibly, by careful seeking (tho I doubt it), find some line in nature along whichterms literally the same, or causes causal in the same way, might be serially strung without limit, if one's interest layin such finding. Within such lines our axioms might hold, causes might cause their effect's effects, etc.; but such linesthemselves would, if found, only be partial members of a vast natural network, within the other lines of which youcould not say, in any sense that a wise man or a sane man would ever think of, in any sense that would not beconcretely silly, that the principle of skipt intermediaries still held good. In the practical world, the world whosesignificances we follow, sames of the same are certainly not sames of one another; and things constantly cause otherthings without being held responsible for everything of which those other things are causes.Professor Bergson, believing as he does in a heraclitean 'devenir réel,' ought, if I rightly understand him, positively todeny that in the actual world the logical axioms hold good without qualification. Not only, according to him, do termschange, so that after a certain time the very elements of things are no longer what they were, but relations alsochange, so as no longer to obtain in the same identical way between the new things that have succeeded upon the oldones. If this were really so, then however indefinitely sames might still be substituted for sames in the logical worldof nothing but pure sameness, in the world of real operations every line of sameness actually started and followed upwould eventually give out, and cease to be traceable any farther. Sames of the same, in such a world, will not always(or rather, in a strict sense will never) be the same as one another, for in such a world there is no literal or idealsameness among numerical differents. Nor in such a world will it be true that the cause of the cause is unreservedlythe cause of the effect; for if we follow lines of real causation, instead of contenting ourselves with Hume's and Kant'seviscerated schematism, we find that remoter effects are seldom aimed at by causal intentions,1 that1Compare the douma with what Perry aimed at."},{"pageNumber":862,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP815 hl[01 03 2011 14 49 29]Page 815no one kind of causal activity continues indefinitely, and that the principle of skipt intermediaries can be talked ofonly in abstracto.1Volumes i, ii, and iii of the Monist (1890 1893) contain a number of articles by Mr. Charles S. Peirce, articles theoriginality of which has apparently prevented their making an immediate impression, but which, if I mistake not, willprove a gold-mine of ideas for thinkers of the coming generation. Mr. Peirce's views, tho reached so differently, arealtogether congruous with Bergson's. Both philosophers believe that the appearance of novelty in things is genuine. Toan observer standing outside of its generating causes, novelty can appear only as so much 'chance,' while to one whostands inside it is the expression of 'free creative activity.' Peirce's 'tychism' is thus practically synonymous withBergson's 'devenir réel.' The common objection to admitting novelties is that by jumping abruptly in, ex nihilo, theyshatter the world's rational continuity. Peirce meets this objection by combining his tychism with an express doctrineof 'synechism' or continuity, the two doctrines merging into the higher synthesis on which he bestows the name of'agapasticism' (loc. cit., iii, 188), which means exactly the same thing as Bergson's 'évolution créatrice.' Novelty, asempirically found, does n't arrive by jumps and jolts, it leaks in insensibly, for adjacents in experience are alwaysinterfused, the smallest real datum being both a coming and a going, and even numerical distinctness being realizedeffectively only after a concrete interval has passed. The intervals also deflect us from the original paths of direction,and all the old identities at last give out, for the fatally continuous infiltration of otherness warps things out of everyoriginal rut. Just so, in a curve, the same direction is never followed, and the conception of it as a myriad-sidedpolygon falsifies it by supposing it to do so for however short a time. Peirce speaks of an 'infinitesimal' tendency todiversification. The mathematical notion of an infinitesimal contains, in truth, the whole paradox of the same and yetthe nascent other, of an identity that won't keep except so far as it keeps failing, that won't transfer, any more than theserial relations1Compare Appendix B, as to what I mean here by 'real' causal activity."},{"pageNumber":863,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP816 hl[01 03 2011 14 50 37]Page 816in question transfer, when you apply them to reality instead of applying them to concepts alone.A friend of mine has an idea, which illustrates on such a magnified scale the impossibility of tracing the same linethrough reality, that I will mention it here. He thinks that nothing more is needed to make history 'scientific' than to getthe content of any two epochs (say the end of the thirteenth and the end of the nineteenth century) accurately defined,then accurately to define the direction of the change that led from the one epoch into the other, and finally to prolongthe line of that direction into the future. So prolonging the line, he thinks, we ought to be able to define the actual stateof things at any future date we please. We all feel the essential unreality of such a conception of 'history' as this; but ifsuch a synechistic pluralism as Peirce, Bergson, and I believe in, be what really exists, every phenomenon ofdevelopment, even the simplest, would prove equally rebellious to our science should the latter pretend to give usliterally accurate instead of approximate, or statistically generalized, pictures of the development of reality.I can give no further account of Mr. Peirce's ideas in this note, but I earnestly advise all students of Bergson tocompare them with those of the french philosopher."},{"pageNumber":864,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP817 hl[01 03 2011 14 51 44]Page 817Index to the LecturesAAbsolute, the, 651 52, 678 79, 681 ff., 708, 709, 715 ff., 721, 754, 763 ff., 771 72;not the same as God, 680, 690;its rationality, 681 f.;its irrationality, 683 r89;difficulty of conceiving it, 717 18.Absolutism, 645, 647, 648, 654, 662 f., 666, 685, 771.

'Truth,' I there say, 'is a property of certain of ourideas. It means their agreement, as falsity means their disagreement, with reality. Pragmatists and intellectualists bothaccept this definition as a matter of course.'Where our ideas [do] not copy definitely their object, what does agreement with that object mean? Pragmatism asksits usual question. ''Grant an idea or belief to be true,\" it says, \"what concrete difference will its being true make inany one's actual life? What experiences [may] be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false?How will the truth be realized? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in experiential terms?\" The momentpragmatism asks this question, it sees the answer: True ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate,and verify. False ideas are those that we cannot. That is the practical difference it makes to us to have true ideas; thattherefore is the meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known as.'The truth of an idea is not a stagnant property inherent in it. Truth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is made trueby events. Its verity is in fact an event, a process, the process namely of its verifying itself, its verification. Its validityis the process of its validation.1'To agree in the widest sense with a reality can only mean to be guided either straight up to it or into its surroundings,or to be put into such working touch with it as to handle either it or something connected with it better than if wedisagreed. Better either intellectually or practically. Any idea that helps us to deal, whether practically or intellec-1But 'verifiability,' I add, 'is as good as verification. For one truth-process completed, there are a million in our lives that function in[the] state of nascency. They lead us towards direct verification; lead us into the surroundings of the object they envisage; and then, ifeverything runs on harmoniously, we are so sure that verification is possible that we omit it, and are usually justified by all that happens.'"},{"pageNumber":875,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP824 hl[01 03 2011 14 57 22]Page 824tually, with either the reality or its belongings, that does n't entangle our progress in frustrations, that fits, in fact, andadapts our life to the reality's whole setting, will agree sufficiently to meet the requirement. It will be true of thatreality.'The true, to put it very briefly, is only the expedient in the way of our thinking, just as the right is only the expedientin the way of our behaving. Expedient in almost any fashion, and expedient in the long run and on the whole, ofcourse; for what meets expediently all the experience in sight won't necessarily meet all farther experiences equallysatisfactorily. Experience, as we know, has ways of boiling over, and making us correct our present formulas.'This account of truth, following upon the similar ones given by Messrs. Dewey and Schiller, has occasioned theliveliest discussion. Few critics have defended it, most of them have scouted it. It seems evident that the subject is ahard one to understand, under its apparent simplicity; and evident also, I think, that the definitive settlement of it willmark a turning-point in the history of epistemology, and consequently in that of general philosophy. In order to makemy own thought more accessible to those who hereafter may have to study the question, I have collected in thevolume that follows all the work of my pen that bears directly on the truth-question. My first statement was in 1884, inthe article that begins the present volume. The other papers follow in the order of their publication. Two or threeappear now for the first time.One of the accusations which I oftenest have had to meet is that of making the truth of our religious beliefs onsist intheir 'feeling good' to us, and in nothing else. I regret to have given some excuse for this charge, by the unguardedlanguage in which, in the book Pragmatism, I spoke of the truth of the belief of certain philosophers in the absolute.Explaining why I do not believe in the absolute myself (p. 521), yet finding that it may secure 'moral holidays' tothose who need them, and is true in so far forth (if to gain moral holidays be a good),1 I offered this as a conciliatoryolive-branch to my1Op. cit., p. 520."},{"pageNumber":876,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP825 hl[01 03 2011 14 58 29]Page 825enemies. But they, as is only too common with such offerings, trampled the gift under foot and turned and rent thegiver. I had counted too much on their good will—oh for the rarity of christian charity under the sun! Oh for the rarityof ordinary secular intelligence also! I had supposed it to be matter of common observation that, of two competingviews of the universe which in all other respects are equal, but of which the first denies some vital human need whilethe second satisfies it, the second will be favored by sane men for the simple reason that it makes the world seem morerational. To choose the first view under such circumstances would be an ascetic act, an act of philosophic self-denialof which no normal human being would be guilty. Using the pragmatic test of the meaning of concepts, I had shownthe concept of the absolute to mean nothing but the holiday giver, the banisher of cosmic fear. One's objectivedeliverance, when one says 'the absolute exists,' amounted, on my showing, just to this, that 'some justification of afeeling of security in presence of the universe,' exists, and that systematically to refuse to cultivate a feeling ofsecurity would be to do violence to a tendency in one's emotional life which might well be respected as prophetic.Apparently my absolutist critics fail to see the workings of their own minds in any such picture, so all that I can do isto apologize, and take my offering back. The absolute is true in no way then, and least of all, by the verdict of thecritics, in the way which I assigned!My treatment of 'God,' 'freedom,' and 'design' was similar. Reducing, by the pragmatic test, the meaning of each ofthese concepts to its positive experienceable operation, I showed them all to mean the same thing, viz., the presence of'promise' in the world. 'God or no God?' means 'promise or no promise?' It seems to me that the alternative isobjective enough, being a question as to whether the cosmos has one character or another, even though our ownprovisional answer be made on subjective grounds. Nevertheless christian and non-christian critics alike accuse me ofsummoning people to say 'God exists,' even when he does n't exist, because forsooth in my philosophy the 'truth' ofthe saying does n't really mean that he exists in any shape whatever, but only that to say so feels good."},{"pageNumber":877,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP826 hl[01 03 2011 14 59 37]Page 826Most of the pragmatist and anti-pragmatist warfare is over what the word 'truth' shall be held to signify, and not overany of the facts embodied in truth-situations; for both pragmatists and anti-pragmatists believe in existent objects, justas they believe in our ideas of them. The difference is that when the pragmatists speak of truth, they mean exclusivelysomething about the ideas, namely their workableness; whereas when anti-pragmatists speak of truth they seem mostoften to mean something about the objects. Since the pragmatist, if he agrees that an idea is 'really' true, also agrees towhatever it says about its object; and since most anti-pragmatists have already come round to agreeing that, if theobject exists, the idea that it does so is workable; there would seem so little left to fight about that I might well beasked why instead of reprinting my share in so much verbal wrangling, I do not show my sense of 'values' by burningit all up.I understand the question and I will give my answer. I am interested in another doctrine in philosophy to which I givethe name of radical empiricism, and it seems to me that the establishment of the pragmatist theory of truth is a step offirst-rate importance in making radical empiricism prevail. Radical empiricism consists first of a postulate, next of astatement of fact, and finally of a generalized conclusion.The postulate is that the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in termsdrawn from experience. [Things of an unexperienceable nature may exist ad libitum, but they form no part of thematerial for philosophic debate.]The statement of fact is that the relations between things, conjunctive as well as disjunctive, are just as much mattersof direct particular experience, neither more so nor less so, than the things themselves.The generalized conclusion is that therefore the parts of experience hold together from next to next by relations thatare themselves parts of experience. The directly apprehended universe needs, in short, no extraneous trans-empiricalconnective support, but possesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous structure.The great obstacle to radical empiricism in the contemporary mind is the rooted rationalist belief that experience as"},{"pageNumber":878,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP827 hl[01 03 2011 15 00 44]Page 827immediately given is all disjunction and no conjunction, and that to make one world out of this separateness, a higherunifying agency must be there. In the prevalent idealism this agency is represented as the absolute all-witness which'relates' things together by throwing 'categories' over them like a net. The most peculiar and unique, perhaps, of allthese categories is supposed to be the truth-relation, which connects parts of reality in pairs, making of one of them aknower, and of the other a thing known, yet which is itself contentless experientially, neither describable, explicable,nor reduceable to lower terms, and denotable only by uttering the name 'truth.'The pragmatist view, on the contrary, of the truth-relation is that it has a definite content, and that everything in it isexperienceable. Its whole nature can be told in positive terms. The 'workableness' which ideas must have, in order tobe true, means particular workings, physical or intellectual, actual or possible, which they may set up from next tonext inside of concrete experience. Were this pragmatic contention admitted, one great point in the victory of radicalempiricism would also be scored, for the relation between an object and the idea that truly knows it, is held byrationalists to be nothing of this describable sort, but to stand outside of all possible temporal experience; and on therelation, so interpreted, rationalism is wonted to make its last most obdurate rally.Now the anti-pragmatist contentions which I try to meet in this volume can be so easily used by rationalists asweapons of resistance, not only to pragmatism but to radical empiricism also (for if the truth-relation weretranscendent, others might be so too), that I feel strongly the strategical importance of having them definitely met andgot out of the way. What our critics most persistently keep saying is that though workings go with truth, yet they donot constitute it. It is numerically additional to them, prior to them, explanatory of them, and in no wise to beexplained by them, we are incessantly told. The first point for our enemies to establish, therefore, is that somethingnumerically additional and prior to the workings is involved in the truth of an idea. Since the object is additional, andusually prior, most rationalists plead it, and boldly accuse us of denying it. This leaves on the bystanders"},{"pageNumber":879,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP828 hl[01 03 2011 15 01 51]Page 828the impression—since we cannot reasonably deny the existence of the object—that our account of truth breaks down,and that our critics have driven us from the field. Altho in various places in this volume I try to refute the slanderouscharge that we deny real existence, I will say here again, for the sake of emphasis, that the existence of the object,whenever the idea asserts it 'truly,' is the only reason, in innumerable cases, why the idea does work successfully, if itwork at all; and that it seems an abuse of language, to say the least, to transfer the word 'truth' from the idea to theobject's existence, when the falsehood of ideas that won't work is explained by that existence as well as the truth ofthose that will.I find this abuse prevailing among my most accomplished adversaries. But once establish the proper verbal custom, letthe word 'truth' represent a property of the idea, cease to make it something mysteriously connected with the objectknown, and the path opens fair and wide, as I believe, to the discussion of radical empiricism on its merits. The truthof an idea will then mean only its workings, or that in it which by ordinary psychological laws sets up those workings;it will mean neither the idea's object, nor anything 'saltatory' inside the idea, that terms drawn from experience cannotdescribe.One word more, ere I end this preface. A distinction is sometimes made between Dewey, Schiller and myself, as if I,in supposing the object's existence, made a concession to popular prejudice which they, as more radical pragmatists,refuse to make. As I myself understand these authors, we all three absolutely agree in admitting the transcendency ofthe object (provided it be an experienceable object) to the subject, in the truth-relation. Dewey in particular hasinsisted almost ad nauseam that the whole meaning of our cognitive states and processes lies in the way they intervenein the control and revaluation of independent existences or facts. His account of knowledge is not only absurd, butmeaningless, unless independent existences be there of which our ideas take account, and for the transformation ofwhich they work. But because he and Schiller refuse to discuss objects and relations 'transcendent' in the sense ofbeing altogether trans-experiential, their critics pounce on sentences in their writings to that effect to show that theydeny the existence within the realm of"},{"pageNumber":880,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP829 hl[01 03 2011 15 02 59]Page 829experience of objects external to the ideas that declare their presence there.1 It seems incredible that educated andapparently sincere critics should so fail to catch their adversary's point of view.What misleads so many of them is possibly also the fact that the universes of discourse of Schiller, Dewey, and myselfare panoramas of different extent, and that what the one postulates explicitly the other provisionally leaves only in astate of implication, while the reader thereupon considers it to be denied. Schiller's universe is the smallest, beingessentially a psychological one. He starts with but one sort of thing, truthclaims, but is led ultimately to theindependent objective facts which they assert, inasmuch as the most successfully validated of all claims is that suchfacts are there. My universe is more essentially epistemological. I start with two things, the objective facts and theclaims, and indicate which claims, the facts being there, will work successfully as the latter's substitutes and whichwill not. I call the former claims true. Dewey's panorama, if I understand this colleague, is the widest of the three, butI refrain from giving my own account of its complexity. Suffice it that he holds as firmly as I do to objectsindependent of our judgments. If I am wrong in saying this, he must correct me. I decline in this matter to becorrected at second hand.I have not pretended in the following pages to consider all the critics of my account of truth, such as Messrs. Taylor,Lovejoy, Gardiner, Bakewell, Creighton, Hibben, Parodi, Salter, Carus, Lalande, Mentré, McTaggart, G. E. Moore,Ladd and others, especially not Professor Schinz, who has published under the title of Anti-pragmatisme an amusing1It gives me pleasure to welcome Professor Carveth Read into the pragmatistic church, so far as his epistemology goes.

What we call acts of cognition are evidently realized through whatwe call brains and their events, whether there be 'souls' dynamically connected with the brains or not. But with neitherbrains nor souls has this essay any business to transact. In it we shall simply assume that cognition is produced,somehow, and limit ourselves to asking what elements it contains, what factors it implies.Cognition is a function of consciousness. The first factor it implies is therefore a state of consciousness wherein thecognition shall take place. Having elsewhere used the word 'feeling' to designate generically all states ofconsciousness considered subjectively, or without respect to their possible function, I shall then say that, whateverelements an act of cognition may imply besides, it at least implies the existence of a feeling. [If the reader share thecurrent antipathy to the word 'feeling,' he may substitute for it, wherever I use it, the word 'idea,' taken in the oldbroad Lockian sense, or he may use the clumsy phrase 'state of consciousness,' or finally he may say 'thought'instead.]Now it is to be observed that the common consent of mankind has agreed that some feelings are cognitive and someare simple facts having a subjective, or, what one might almost call a physical, existence, but no such self-transcendent function as would be implied in their being pieces of knowledge. Our task is again limited here. We arenot to ask, 'How is self-transcendence possible?' We are only to ask, 'How comes it that common sense has assigned anumber of cases in which it is assumed not only to be possible but actual? And what are the marks used by commonsense to distinguish those1Read before the Aristotelian Society, December 1, 1884, and first published in Mind, vol. x (1885).—This, and the following articleshave received a very slight verbal revision, consisting mostly in the omission of redundancy."},{"pageNumber":885,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP834 hl[01 03 2011 15 08 36]Page 834cases from the rest?' In short, our inquiry is a chapter in descriptive psychology,—hardly anything more.Condillac embarked on a quest similar to this by his famous hypothesis of a statue to which various feelings weresuccessively imparted. Its first feeling was supposed to be one of fragrance. But to avoid all possible complicationwith the question of genesis, let us not attribute even to a statue the possession of our imaginary feeling. Let us rathersuppose it attached to no matter, nor localized at any point in space, but left swinging in vacuo, as it were, by thedirect creative fiat of a god. And let us also, to escape entanglement with difficulties about the physical or psychicalnature of its 'object,' not call it a feeling of fragrance or of any other determinate sort, but limit ourselves to assumingthat it is a feeling of q. What is true of it under this abstract name will be no less true of it in any more particular shape(such as fragrance, pain, hardness) which the reader may suppose.Now, if this feeling of q be the only creation of the god, it will of course form the entire universe. And if, to escapethe cavils of that large class of persons who believe that semper idem sentire ac non sentire are the same,1 we allowthe feeling to be of as short a duration as they like, that universe will only need to last an infinitesimal part of asecond. The feeling in question will thus be reduced to its fighting weight, and all that befalls it in the way of acognitive function must be held to befall in the brief instant of its quickly snuffed-out life,—a life, it will also benoticed, that has no other moment of consciousness either preceding or following it.1'The Relativity of Knowledge,' held in this sense, is, it may be observed in passing, one of the oddest of philosophic superstitions.Whatever facts may be cited in its favor are due to the properties of nerve-tissue, which may be exhausted by too prolonged anexcitement. Patients with neuralgias that last unremittingly for days can, however, assure us that the limits of this nerve-law are prettywidely drawn. But if we physically could get a feeling that should last eternally unchanged, what atom of logical or psychologicalargument is there to prove that it would not be felt as long as it lasted, and felt for just what it is, all that time? The reason for theopposite prejudice seems to be our reluctance to think that so stupid a thing as such a feeling would necessarily be, should be allowed tofill eternity with its presence. An interminable acquaintance, leading to no knowledge-about,—such would be its condition."},{"pageNumber":886,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP835 hl[01 03 2011 15 09 43]Page 835Well now, can our little feeling, thus left alone in the universe,—for the god and we psychological critics may besupposed left out of the account,—can the feeling, I say, be said to have any sort of a cognitive function? For it toknow, there must be something to be known. What is there, on the present supposition? One may reply, 'the feeling'scontent q.' But does it not seem more proper to call this the feeling's quality than its content? Does not the word'content' suggest that the feeling has already dirempted itself as an act from its content as an object? And would it bequite safe to assume so promptly that the quality q of a feeling is one and the same thing with a feeling of the qualityq? The quality q, so far, is an entirely subjective fact which the feeling carries so to speak endogenously, or in itspocket. If any one pleases to dignify so simple a fact as this by the name of knowledge, of course nothing can preventhim. But let us keep closer to the path of common usage, and reserve the name knowledge for the cognition of'realities,' meaning by realities things that exist independently of the feeling through which their cognition occurs. Ifthe content of the feeling occur nowhere in the universe outside of the feeling itself, and perish with the feeling,common usage refuses to call it a reality, and brands it as a subjective feature of the feeling's constitution, or at themost as the feeling's dream.For the feeling to be cognitive in the specific sense, then, it must be self-transcendent; and we must prevail upon thegod to create a reality outside of it to correspond to its intrinsic quality q. Thus only can it be redeemed from thecondition of being a solipsism. If now the new-created reality resemble the feeling's quality q, I say that the feelingmay be held by us to be cognizant of that reality.This first instalment of my thesis is sure to be attacked. But one word before defending it. 'Reality' has become ourwarrant for calling a feeling cognitive; but what becomes our warrant for calling anything reality? The only reply is—the faith of the present critic or inquirer. At every moment of his life he finds himself subject to a belief in somerealities, even though his realities of this year should prove to be his illusions of the next. Whenever he finds that thefeeling he is studying contemplates what he himself regards as a reality, he"},{"pageNumber":887,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP836 hl[01 03 2011 15 10 50]Page 836must of course admit the feeling itself to be truly cognitive. We are ourselves the critics here; and we shall find ourburden much lightened by being allowed to take reality in this relative and provisional way. Every science must makesome assumptions. Erkenntnisstheoretiker are but fallible mortals. When they study the function of cognition, they doit by means of the same function in themselves. And knowing that the fountain cannot go higher than its source, weshould promptly confess that our results in this field are affected by our own liability to err. The most we can claim is,that what we say about cognition may be counted as true as what we say about anything else. If our hearers agreewith us about what are to be held 'realities,' they will perhaps also agree to the reality of our doctrine of the way inwhich they are known. We cannot ask for more.Our terminology shall follow the spirit of these remarks. We will deny the function of knowledge to any feelingwhose quality or content we do not ourselves believe to exist outside of that feeling as well as in it. We may call sucha feeling a dream if we like; we shall have to see later whether we can call it a fiction or an error.To revert now to our thesis. Some persons will immediately cry out, 'How can a reality resemble a feeling?' Here wefind how wise we were to name the quality of the feeling by an algebraic letter q. We flank the whole difficulty ofresemblance between an inner state and an outward reality, by leaving it free to any one to postulate as the realitywhatever sort of thing he thinks can resemble a feeling,—if not an outward thing, then another feeling like the firstone,—the mere feeling q in the critic's mind for example. Evading thus this objection, we turn to another which is sureto be urged.It will come from those philosophers to whom 'thought,' in the sense of a knowledge of relations, is the all in all ofmental life; and who hold a merely feeling consciousness to be no better—one would sometimes say from theirutterances, a good deal worse—than no consciousness at all. Such phrases as these, for example, are common to-dayin the mouths of those who claim to walk in the footprints of Kant and Hegel rather than in the ancestral Englishpaths: 'A perception detached from all others, ''left out of the heap"},{"pageNumber":888,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP837 hl[01 03 2011 15 11 58]Page 837we call a mind,\" being out of all relation, has no qualities—is simply nothing. We can no more consider it than we cansee vacancy.' 'It is simply in itself fleeting, momentary, unnameable (because while we name it it has become another),and for the very same reason unknowable, the very negation of knowability.' 'Exclude from what we have consideredreal all qualities constituted by relation, we find that none are left.'Altho such citations as these from the writings of Professor Green might be multiplied almost indefinitely, they wouldhardly repay the pains of collection, so egregiously false is the doctrine they teach. Our little supposed feeling,whatever it may be, from the cognitive point of view, whether a bit of knowledge or a dream, is certainly no psychicalzero. It is a most positively and definitely qualified inner fact, with a complexion all its own. Of course there are manymental facts which it is not. It knows q, if q be a reality, with a very minimum of knowledge. It neither dates norlocates it. It neither classes nor names it. And it neither knows itself as a feeling, nor contrasts itself with otherfeelings, nor estimates its own duration or intensity. It is, in short, if there is no more of it than this, a most dumb andhelpless and useless kind of thing.But if we must describe it by so many negations, and if it can say nothing about itself or about anything else, by whatright do we deny that it is psychical zero? And may not the 'relationists' be right after all?In the innocent looking word 'about' lies the solution of this riddle; and a simple enough solution it is when franklylooked at. A quotation from a too seldom quoted book, the Exploratio Philosophica of John Grote (London, 1865), p.60, will form the best introduction to it.'Our knowledge,' writes Grote, 'may be contemplated in either of two ways, or, to use other words, we may speak in adouble manner of the \"object\" of knowledge. That is, we may either use language thus: we know a thing, a man, etc.;or we may use it thus: we know such and such things about the thing, the man, etc. Language in general, following itstrue logical instinct, distinguishes between these two applications of the notion of knowledge, the one being "},{"pageNumber":889,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP838 hl[01 03 2011 15 13 05]Page 838noscere, kennen, connaître, the other being scire, wissen, savoir. In the origin, the former may be consideredmore what I have called phenomenal—it is the notion of knowledge as acquaintance or familiarity with what isknown; which notion is perhaps more akin to the phenomenal bodily communication, and is less purely intellectualthan the other; it is the kind of knowledge which we have of a thing by the presentation to the senses or therepresentation of it in picture or type, a Vorstellung. The other, which is what we express in judgments orpropositions, what is embodied in Begriffe or concepts without any necessary imaginative representation, is in itsorigin the more intellectual notion of knowledge. There is no reason, however, why we should not express ourknowledge, whatever its kind, in either manner, provided only we do not confusedly express it, in the sameproposition or piece of reasoning, in both.'Now obviously if our supposed feeling of q is (if knowledge at all) only knowledge of the mere acquaintance-type, itis milking a he-goat, as the ancients would have said, to try to extract from it any deliverance about anything underthe sun, even about itself. And it is as unjust, after our failure, to turn upon it and call it a psychical nothing, as itwould be, after our fruitless attack upon the billy-goat, to proclaim the non-lactiferous character of the whole goat-tribe. But the entire industry of the Hegelian school in trying to shove simple sensation out of the pale of philosophicrecognition is founded on this false issue. It is always the 'speechlessness' of sensation, its inability to make any'statement,'1 that is held to make the very notion of it meaningless, and to justify the student of knowledge in scoutingit out of existence. 'Significance,' in the sense of standing as the sign of other mental states, is taken to be the solefunction of what mental states we have; and from the perception that our little primitive sensation has as yet nosignificance in this literal sense, it is an easy step to call it first meaningless, next senseless, then vacuous, and finallyto brand it as absurd and inadmissible. But in this universal liquidation, this everlasting slip,1See, for example, Green's Introduction to Hume's Treatise of Human Nature, p. 36."},{"pageNumber":890,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP839 hl[01 03 2011 15 14 13]Page 839slip, slip, of direct acquaintance into knowledge-about, until at last nothing is left about which the knowledge can besupposed to obtain, does not all 'significance' depart from the situation? And when our knowledge about things hasreached its never so complicated perfection, must there not needs abide alongside of it and inextricably mixed in withit some acquaintance with what things all this knowledge is about?Now, our supposed little feeling gives a what; and if other feelings should succeed which remember the first, its whatmay stand as subject or predicate of some piece of knowledge-about, of some judgment, perceiving relations betweenit and other whats which the other feelings may know. The hitherto dumb q will then receive a name and be no longerspeechless. But every name, as students of logic know, has its 'denotation'; and the denotation always means somereality or content, relationless ab extra or with its internal relations unanalyzed, like the q which our primitivesensation is supposed to know. No relation-expressing proposition is possible except on the basis of a preliminaryacquaintance with such 'facts,' with such contents, as this. Let the q be fragrance, let it be toothache, or let it be a morecomplex kind of feeling, like that of the full-moon swimming in her blue abyss, it must first come in that simpleshape, and be held fast in that first intention, before any knowledge about it can be attained. The knowledge about itis it with a context added. Undo it, and what is added cannot be context.1Let us say no more then about this objection, but enlarge our thesis, thus: If there be in the universe a q other than theq in the feeling, the latter may have acquaintance with an entity ejective to itself; an acquaintance moreover, which, asmere acquaintance, it would be hard to imagine susceptible either of improvement or increase, being in its way com-1If A enters and B exclaims, 'Did n't you see my brother on the stairs?' we all hold that A may answer, 'I saw him, but did n't know hewas your brother'; ignorance of brotherhood not abolishing power to see. But those who, on account of the unrelatedness of the first factswith which we become acquainted, deny them to be 'known' to us, ought in consistency to maintain that if A did not perceive therelationship of the man on the stairs to B, it was impossible he should have noticed him at all."},{"pageNumber":891,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP840 hl[01 03 2011 15 15 20]Page 840plete; and which would oblige us (so long as we refuse not to call acquaintance knowledge) to say not only that thefeeling is cognitive, but that all qualities of feeling, so long as there is anything outside of them which they resemble,are feelings of qualities of existence, and perceptions of outward fact.The point of this vindication of the cognitive function of the first feeling lies, it will be noticed, in the discovery that qdoes exist elsewhere than in it. In case this discovery were not made, we could not be sure the feeling was cognitive;and in case there were nothing outside to be discovered, we should have to call the feeling a dream. But the feelingitself cannot make the discovery. Its own q is the only q it grasps; and its own nature is not a particle altered by havingthe self-transcendent function of cognition either added to it or taken away. The function is accidental; synthetic, notanalytic; and falls outside and not inside its being.1A feeling feels as a gun shoots. If there be nothing to be felt or hit, they discharge themselves ins blaue hinein. If,however, something starts up opposite them, they no longer simply shoot or feel, they hit and know.But with this arises a worse objection than any yet made. We the critics look on and see a real q and a feeling of q;and because the two resemble each other, we say the one knows the other. But what right have we to say this until weknow that the feeling of q means to stand for or represent just that same other q? Suppose, instead of one q, a numberof real q's in the field. If the gun shoots and hits, we can easily see which one of them it hits. But how can wedistinguish which one1It seems odd to call so important a function accidental, but I do not see how we can mend the matter. Just as, if we start with the realityand ask how it may come to be known, we can only reply by invoking a feeling which shall reconstruct it in its own more privatefashion; so, if we start with the feeling and ask how it may come to know, we can only reply by invoking a reality which shallreconstruct it in its own more public fashion. In either case, however, the datum we start with remains just what it was. One may easilyget lost in verbal mysteries about the difference between quality of feeling and feeling of quality, between receiving and reconstructingthe knowledge of a reality. But at the end we must confess that the notion of real cognition involves an unmediated dualism of theknower and the known. See Bowne's Metaphysics, New York, 1882, pp. 403 412, and various passages in Lotze, e.g., Logic, § 308.['Unmediated' is a bad word to have used.—1909.]"},{"pageNumber":892,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP841 hl[01 03 2011 15 16 27]Page 841the feeling knows? It knows the one it stands for. But which one does it stand for? It declares no intention in thisrespect. It merely resembles; it resembles all indifferently; and resembling, per se, is not necessarily representing orstanding-for at all. Eggs resemble each other, but do not on that account represent, stand for, or know each other. Andif you say this is because neither of them is a feeling, then imagine the world to consist of nothing but toothaches,which are feelings, feelings resembling each other exactly,—would they know each other the better for all that?The case of q being a bare quality like that of toothachepain is quite different from that of its being a concreteindividual thing. There is practically no test for deciding whether the feeling of a bare quality means to represent it ornot. It can do nothing to the quality beyond resembling it, simply because an abstract quality is a thing to whichnothing can be done. Being without context or environment or principium individuationis, a quiddity with nohæcceity, a platonic idea, even duplicate editions of such a quality (were they possible), would be indiscernible, andno sign could be given, no result altered, whether the feeling meant to stand for this edition or for that, or whether itsimply resembled the quality without meaning to stand for it at all.If now we grant a genuine pluralism of editions to the quality q, by assigning to each a context which shall distinguishit from its mates, we may proceed to explain which edition of it the feeling knows, by extending our principle ofresemblance to the context too, and saying the feeling knows the particular q whose context it most exactly duplicates.But here again the theoretic doubt recurs: duplication and coincidence, are they knowledge? The gun shows which q itpoints to and hits, by breaking it. Until the feeling can show us which q it points to and knows, by some equallyflagrant token, why are we not free to deny that it either points to or knows any one of the real q's at all, and to affirmthat the word 'resemblance' exhaustively describes its relation to the reality?Well, as a matter of fact, every actual feeling does show us, quite as flagrantly as the gun, which q it points to; andpractically in concrete cases the matter is decided by an element"},{"pageNumber":893,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP842 hl[01 03 2011 15 17 35]Page 842we have hitherto left out. Let us pass from abstractions to possible instances, and ask our obliging deus ex machina toframe for us a richer world. Let him send me, for example, a dream of the death of a certain man, and let himsimultaneously cause the man to die. How would our practical instinct spontaneously decide whether this were a caseof cognition of the reality, or only a sort of marvellous coincidence of a resembling reality with my dream? Just suchpuzzling cases as this are what the 'society for psychical research' is busily collecting and trying to interpret in themost reasonable way.If my dream were the only one of the kind I ever had in my life, if the context of the death in the dream differed inmany particulars from the real death's context, and if my dream led me to no action about the death, unquestionablywe should all call it a strange coincidence, and naught besides. But if the death in the dream had a long context,agreeing point for point with every feature that attended the real death; if I were constantly having such dreams, allequally perfect, and if on awaking I had a habit of acting immediately as if they were true and so getting 'the start' ofmy more tardily instructed neighbors,—we should in all probability have to admit that I had some mysterious kind ofclairvoyant power, that my dreams in an inscrutable way meant just those realities they figured, and that the word'coincidence' failed to touch the root of the matter. And whatever doubts any one preserved would completely vanish,if it should appear that from the midst of my dream I had the power of interfering with the course of the reality, andmaking the events in it turn this way or that, according as I dreamed they should. Then at least it would be certain thatmy waking critics and my dreaming self were dealing with the same.And thus do men invariably decide such a question. The falling of the dream's practical consequences into the realworld, and the extent of the resemblance between the two worlds are the criteria they instinctively use.1 All feeling isfor the sake1The thoroughgoing objector might, it is true, still return to the charge, and, granting a dream which should completely mirror the realuniverse, and all the actions dreamed in which should be instantly matched by duplicate actions in this universe, still insist that this isnothing more than harmony,(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":894,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP843 hl[01 03 2011 15 18 42]Page 843of action, all feeling results in action,—to-day no argument is needed to prove these truths. But by a most singulardisposition of nature which we may conceive to have been different, my feelings act upon the realities within mycritic's world. Unless, then, my critic can prove that my feeling does not 'point to' those realities which it acts upon,how can he continue to doubt that he and I are alike cognizant of one and the same real world? If the action isperformed in one world, that must be the world the feeling intends; if in another world, that is the world the feelinghas in mind. If your feeling bear no fruits in my world, I call it utterly detached from my world; I call it a solipsism,and call its world a dream-world. If your toothache do not prompt you to act as if I had a toothache, nor even as if Ihad a separate existence; if you neither say to me, 'I know now how you must suffer!' nor tell me of a remedy, I denythat your feeling, however it may resemble mine, is really cognizant of mine. It gives no sign of being cognizant, andsuch a sign is absolutely necessary to my admission that it is.Before I can think you to mean my world, you must affect my world; before I can think you to mean much of it, youmust affect much of it; and before I can be sure you mean it as I do, you must affect it just as I should if I were inyour place. Then I, your critic, will gladly believe that we are(Footnote continued from previous page)and that it is as far as ever from being made clear whether the dream-world refers to that other world, all of whose details it so closelycopies. This objection leads deep into metaphysics. I do not impugn its importance, and justice obliges me to say that but for theteachings of my colleague, Dr. Josiah Royce, I should neither have grasped its full force nor made my own practical and psychologicalpoint of view as clear to myself as it is. On this occasion I prefer to stick steadfastly to that point of view; but I hope that Dr. Royce'smore fundamental criticism of the function of cognition may ere long see the light. [I referred in this note to Royce's Religious aspect ofphilosophy, then about to be published. This powerful book maintained that the notion of referring involved that of an inclusive mindthat shall own both the real q and the mental q, and use the latter expressly as a representative symbol of the former. At the time I couldnot refute this transcendentalist opinion. Later, largely through the influence of Professor D. S. Miller (see his essay 'The meaning oftruth and error,' in the Philosophical Review for 1893, vol. 2 p. 403) I came to see that any definitely experienceable workings wouldserve as intermediaries quite as well as the absolute mind's intentions would.]"},{"pageNumber":895,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP844 hl[01 03 2011 15 19 49]Page 844thinking, not only of the same reality, but that we are thinking it alike, and thinking of much of its extent.Without the practical effects of our neighbor's feelings on our own world, we should never suspect the existence ofour neighbor's feelings at all, and of course should never find ourselves playing the critic as we do in this article. Theconstitution of nature is very peculiar. In the world of each of us are certain objects called human bodies, which moveabout and act on all the other objects there, and the occasions of their action are in the main what the occasions of ouraction would be, were they our bodies. They use words and gestures, which, if we used them, would have thoughtsbehind them,—no mere thoughts überbaupt, however, but strictly determinate thoughts. I think you have the notion offire in general, because I see you act towards this fire in my room just as I act towards it,—poke it and present yourperson towards it, and so forth. But that binds me to believe that if you feel 'fire' at all, this is the fire you feel. As amatter of fact, whenever we constitute ourselves into psychological critics, it is not by dint of discovering whichreality a feeling 'resembles' that we find out which reality it means. We become first aware of which one it means, andthen we suppose that to be the one it resembles. We see each other looking at the same objects, pointing to them andturning them over in various ways, and there upon we hope and trust that all of our several feelings resemble thereality and each other. But this is a thing of which we are never theoretically sure. Still, it would practically be a caseof grübelsucht, if a ruffian were assaulting and drubbing my body, to spend much time in subtle speculation either asto whether his vision of my body resembled mine, or as to whether the body he really meant to insult were not somebody in his mind's eye, altogether other from my own. The practical point of view brushes such metaphysical cobwebsaway. If what he have in mind be not my body, why call we it a body at all? His mind is inferred by me as a term, towhose existence we trace the things that happen. The inference is quite void if the term, once inferred, be separatedfrom its connection with the body that made me infer it, and connected with another that is not mine at all. No matterfor the metaphysical puzzle of how our two minds,"},{"pageNumber":896,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP845 hl[01 03 2011 15 20 56]Page 845the ruffian's and mine, can mean the same body. Men who see each other's bodies sharing the same space, treading thesame earth, splashing the same water, making the same air resonant, and pursuing the same game and eating out of thesame dish, will never practically believe in a pluralism of solipsistic worlds.Where, however, the actions of one mind seem to take no effect in the world of the other, the case is different. This iswhat happens in poetry and fiction. Every one knows Ivanhoe, for example; but so long as we stick to the story pureand simple without regard to the facts of its production, few would hesitate to admit that there are as many differentIvanhoes as there are different minds cognizant of the story.1 The fact that all these Ivanhoes resemble each other doesnot prove the contrary. But if an alteration invented by one man in his version were to reverberate immediatelythrough all the other versions, and produce changes therein, we should then easily agree that all these thinkers werethinking the same Ivanhoe, and that, fiction or no fiction, it formed a little world common to them all.Having reached this point, we may take up our thesis and improve it again. Still calling the reality by the name of qand1That is, there is no real 'Ivanhoe,' not even the one in Sir Walter Scott's mind as he was writing the story. That one is only the first oneof the Ivanhoe-solipsisms. It is quite true we can make it the real Ivanhoe if we like, and then say that the other Ivanhoes know it or donot know it, according as they refer to and resemble it or no. This is done by bringing in Sir Walter Scott himself as the author of the realIvanhoe, and so making a complex object of both. This object, however, is not a story pure and simple. It has dynamic relations with theworld common to the experience of all the readers. Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe got itself printed in volumes which we all can handle, andto any one of which we can refer to see which of our versions be the true one, i. e., the original one of Scott himself. We can see themanuscript; in short we can get back to the Ivanhoe in Scott's mind by many an avenue and channel of this real world of our experience,—a thing we can by no means do with either the Ivanhoe or the Rebecca, either the Templar or the Isaac of York, of the story takensimply as such, and detached from the conditions of its production. Everywhere, then, we have the same test: can we pass continuouslyfrom two objects in two minds to a third object which seems to be in both minds, because each mind feels every modification imprintedon it by the other? If so, the first two objects named are derivatives, to say the least, from the same third object, and may be held, if theyresemble each other, to refer to one and the same reality."},{"pageNumber":897,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP846 hl[01 03 2011 15 22 04]Page 846letting the critic's feeling vouch for it, we can say that any other feeling will be held cognizant of q, provided it bothresemble q, and refer to q, as shown by its either modifying q directly, or modifying some other reality, p or r, whichthe critic knows to be continuous with q. Or more shortly, thus: The feeling of q knows whatever reality it resembles,and either directly or indirectly operates on. If it resemble without operating, it is a dream; if it operate withoutresembling, it is an error.1It is to be feared that the reader may consider this formula rather insignificant and obvious, and hardly worth the laborof so many pages, especially when he considers that the only cases to which it applies are percepts, and that the wholefield1Among such errors are those cases in which our feeling operates on a reality which it does partially resemble, and yet does not intend:as for instance, when I take up your umbrella, meaning to take my own. I cannot be said here either to know your umbrella, or my own,which latter my feeling more completely resembles. I am mistaking them both, misrepresenting their context, etc.We have spoken in the text as if the critic were necessarily one mind, and the feeling criticised another. But the criticised feeling and its criticmay be earlier and later feelings of the same mind, and here it might seem that we could dispense with the notion of operating, to prove thatcritic and criticised are referring to and meaning to represent the same. We think we see our past feelings directly, and know what they referto without appeal. At the worst, we can always fix the intention of our present feeling and make it refer to the same reality to which any oneof our past feelings may have referred. So we need no 'operating' here, to make sure that the feeling and its critic mean the same real q. Well,all the better if this is so! We have covered the more complex and difficult case in our text, and we may let this easier one go. The main thingat present is to stick to practical psychology, and ignore metaphysical difficulties.One more remark. Our formula contains, it will be observed, nothing to correspond to the great principle of cognition laid down by ProfessorFerrier in his Institutes of Metaphysic and apparently adopted by all the followers of Fichte, the principle, namely, that for knowledge to beconstituted there must be knowledge of the knowing mind along with whatever else is known: not q, as we have supposed, but q plus myself,must be the least I can know. It is certain that the common sense of mankind never dreams of using any such principle when it tries todiscriminate between conscious states that are knowledge and conscious states that are not. So that Ferrier's principle, if it have any relevancyat all, must have relevancy to the metaphysical possibility of consciousness at large, and not to the practically recognized constitution ofcognitive consciousness. We may therefore pass it by without further notice here."},{"pageNumber":898,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP847 hl[01 03 2011 15 23 13]Page 847of symbolic or conceptual thinking seems to elude its grasp. Where the reality is either a material thing or act, or astate of the critic's consciousness, I may both mirror it in my mind and operate upon it—in the latter case indirectly, ofcourse—as soon as I perceive it. But there are many cognitions, universally allowed to be such, which neither mirrornor operate on their realities.In the whole field of symbolic thought we are universally held both to intend, to speak of, and to reach conclusionsabout—to know in short—particular realities, without having in our subjective consciousness any mind-stuff thatresembles them even in a remote degree. We are instructed about them by language which awakens no consciousnessbeyond its sound; and we know which realities they are by the faintest and most fragmentary glimpse of some remotecontext they may have and by no direct imagination of themselves. As minds may differ here, let me speak in the firstperson. I am sure that my own current thinking has words for its almost exclusive subjective material, words whichare made intelligible by being referred to some reality that lies beyond the horizon of direct consciousness, and ofwhich I am only aware as of a terminal more existing in a certain direction, to which the words might lead but do notlead yet. The subject, or topic, of the words is usually something towards which I mentally seem to pitch them in abackward way, almost as I might jerk my thumb over my shoulder to point at something, without looking round, if Iwere only entirely sure that it was there. The upshort, or conclusion, of the words is something towards which I seemto incline my head forwards, as if giving assent to its existence, tho all my mind's eye catches sight of my be sometatter of an image connected with it, which tatter, however, if only endued with the feeling of familiarity and reality,makes me feel that the whole to which it belongs is rational and real, and fit to be let pass.Here then is cognitive consciousness on a large scale, and yet what it knows, it hardly resembles in the least degree.The formula last laid down for our thesis must therefore be made more complete. We may now express it thus: Apercept knows whatever reality it directly or indirectly operates on and resembles;"},{"pageNumber":899,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP848 hl[01 03 2011 15 24 20]Page 848a conceptual feeling, or thought knows1 a reality, whenever it actually or potentially terminates in a percept thatoperates on, or resembles that reality, or is otherwise connected with it or with its context. The latter percept may beeither sensation or sensorial idea; and when I say the thought must terminate in such a percept, I mean that it mustultimately be capable of leading up thereto,—by the way of practical experience, if the terminal feeling be a sensation;by the way of logical or habitual suggestion, if it be only an image in the mind.Let an illustration make this plainer. I open the first book I take up, and read the first sentence that meets my eye:'Newton saw the handiwork of God in the heavens as plainly as Paley in the animal kingdom.' I immediately lookback and try to analyze the subjective state in which I rapidly apprehended this sentence as I read it. In the first placethere was an obvious feeling that the sentence was intelligible and rational and related to the world of realities. Therewas also a sense of agreement or harmony between 'Newton,' 'Paley,' and 'God' There was no apparent imageconnected with the words 'heavens,' or 'handiwork,' or 'God'; they were words merely. With 'animal kingdom' I thinkthere was the faintest consciousness (it may possibly have been an image of the steps) of the Museum of Zoology inthe town of Cambridge where I write. With 'Paley' there was an equally faint consciousness of a small dark leatherbook; and with 'Newton' a pretty distinct vision of the right-hand lower corner of a curling periwig. This is all themind-stuff I can discover in my first consciousness of the meaning of this sentence, and I am afraid that even not allof this would have been present had I come upon the sentence in a genuine reading of the book, and not picked it outfor an experiment. And yet my consciousness was truly cognitive. The sentence is 'about realities' which mypsychological critic—for we must not forget him—acknowledges to be such, even as he acknowledges my distinctfeeling that they are realities, and my acquiescence in the general rightness of what I read of them, to be trueknowledge on my part.Now what justifies my critic in being as lenient as this? This1Is an incomplete 'thought about' that reality, that reality is its 'topic,' etc."},{"pageNumber":900,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP849 hl[01 03 2011 15 25 28]Page 849singularly inadequate consciousness of mine, made up of symbols that neither resemble nor affect the realities theystand for,—how can he be sure it is cognizant of the very realities he has himself in mind?He is sure because in countless like cases he has seen such inadequate and symbolic thoughts, by developingthemselves, terminate in percepts that practically modified and presumably resembled his own. By 'developing'themselves is meant obeying their tendencies, following up the suggestions nascently present in them, working in thedirection in which they seem to point, clearing up the penumbra, making distinct the halo, unravelling the fringe,which is part of their composition, and in the midst of which their more substantive kernel of subjective content seemsconsciously to lie. Thus I may develop my thought in the Paley direction by procuring the brown leather volume andbringing the passages about the animal kingdom before the critic's eyes. I may satisfy him that the words mean for mejust what they mean for him, by showing him in concreto the very animals and their arrangements, of which the pagestreat. I may get Newton's works and portraits; or if I follow the line of suggestion of the wig, I may smother my criticin seventeenth century matters pertaining to Newton's environment, to show that the word 'Newton' has the same locusand relations in both our minds. Finally I may, by act and word, persuade him that what I mean by God and theheavens and the analogy of the handiworks, is just what he means also.My demonstration in the last resort is to his senses. My thought makes me act on his senses much as he might himselfact on them, were he pursuing the consequences of a perception of his own. Practically then my thought terminates inhis realities. He willingly supposes it, therefore, to be of them, and inwardly to resemble what his own thought wouldbe, were it of the same symbolic sort as mine. And the pivot and fulcrum and support of his mental persuasion, is thesensible operation which my thought leads me, or may lead, to effect—the bringing of Paley's book, of Newton'sportrait, etc., before his very eyes.In the last analysis, then, we believe that we all know and think about and talk about the same world, because webelieve"},{"pageNumber":901,"pageContent":" Page 850our PERCEPTS are possessed by us in common. And we believe this because the percepts of each one of us seem tobe changed in consequence of changes in the percepts of some one else. What I am for you is in the first instance apercept of your own. Unexpectedly, however, I open and show you a book, uttering certain sounds the while. Theseacts are also your percepts, but they so resemble acts of yours with feelings prompting them, that you cannot doubt Ihave the feelings too, or that the book is one book felt in both our worlds. That it is felt in the same way, that myfeelings of it resemble yours, is something of which we never can be sure, but which we assume as the simplesthypothesis that meets the case. As a matter of fact, we never are sure of it, and, as erkenntnisstheoretiker, we can onlysay that of feelings that should not resemble each other, both could not know the same thing at the same time in thesame way.1 If each holds to its own percept as the reality, it is bound to say of the other percept, that, though it mayintend that reality, and prove this by working change upon it, yet, if it do not resemble it, it is all false and wrong.2If this be so of percepts, how much more so of higher modes of thought! Even in the sphere of sensation individualsare probably different enough. Comparative study of the simplest conceptual elements seems to show a widerdivergence still. And when it comes to general theories and emotional attitudes towards life, it is indeed time to saywith Thackeray, 'My friend, two different universes walk about under your hat and under mine.'What can save us at all and prevent us from flying asunder into a chaos of mutually repellent solipsisms? Throughwhat can our several minds commune? Through nothing but the mutual resemblance of those of our perceptualfeelings which1Though both might terminate in the same thing and be incomplete thoughts 'about' it.2The difference between Idealism and Realism is immaterial here. What is said in the text is consistent with either theory. A law by whichmy percept shall change yours directly is no more mysterious than a law by which it shall first change a physical reality, and then the realitychange yours. In either case you and I seem knit into a continuous world, and not to form a pair of solipsisms."},{"pageNumber":902,"pageContent":"file:///E|/Tarama/MM3/Dosyalar/netlibrary/www com/nlreader/Page 851 html[02 03 2011 10:39:01]Page 851have this power of modifying one another, which are mere dumb knowledges-of-acquaintance, and which must alsoresemble their realities or not know them aright at all. In such pieces of knowledge-of-acquaintance all ourknowledge-about must end, and carry a sense of this possible termination as part of its content. These percepts, thesetermini, these sensible things, these mere matters-of-acquaintance, are the only realities we ever directly know, andthe whole history of our thought is the history of our substitution of one of them for another, and the reduction of thesubstitute to the status of a conceptual sign. Contemned though they be by some thinkers, these sensations are themother-earth, the anchorage, the stable rock, the first and last limits, the terminus a quo and the terminus ad quem ofthe mind. To find such sensational termini should be our aim with all our higher thought. They end discussion; theydestroy the false conceit of knowledge; and without them we are all at sea with each other's meaning. If two men actalike on a percept, they believe themselves to feel alike about it; if not, they may suspect they know it in differingways. We can never be sure we understand each other till we are able to bring the matter to this test.1 This is whymetaphysical discussions are so much like fighting with the air; they have no practical issue of a sensational kind.'Scientific' theories, on the other hand, always terminate in definite percepts. You can deduce a possible sensationfrom your theory and, taking me into your laboratory, prove that your theory is true of my world by giving me thesensation then and there. Beautiful is the flight of conceptual reason through the upper air of truth. No wonderphilosophers are dazzled by it still, and no wonder they look with some disdain at the low earth of feeling from whichthe goddess launched herself aloft. But woe to her if she return not home to its acquaint-1'There is no distinction of meaning so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice.

In this earlier article we find distinctlyasserted:—1. The reality, external to the true idea;2. The critic, reader, or epistemologist, with his own belief, as warrant for this reality's existence;3. The experienceable environment, as the vehicle or medium connecting knower with known, and yielding thecognitive relation;4. The notion of pointing, through this medium, to the reality, as one condition of our being said to know it;5. That of resembling it, and eventually affecting it, as determining the pointing to it and not to something else.6. The elimination of the 'epistemological gulf,' so that the whole truth-relation falls inside of the continuities ofconcrete experience, and is constituted of particular processes, varying with every object and subject, and susceptibleof being described in detail.The defects in this earlier account are:—1. The possibly undue prominence given to resembling, which altho a fundamental function in knowing truly, is sooften dispensed with;2. The undue emphasis laid upon operating on the object itself, which in many cases is indeed decisive of that beingwhat we refer to, but which is often lacking, or replaced by operations on other things related to the object.3. The imperfect development of the generalized notion of the workability of the feeling or idea as equivalent to thatsatisfactory adaptation to the particular reality, which constitutes the truth of the idea. It is this more generalizednotion, as covering all such specifications as pointing, fitting, operating or resembling, that distinguishes thedeveloped view of Dewey, Schiller, and myself.4.

Altho such things as the white paper before our eyes can be known intuitively, most of the things weknow, the tigers now in India, for example, or the scholastic system of philosophy, are known only representatively orsymbolically.Suppose, to fix our ideas, that we take first a case of conceptual knowledge; and let it be our knowledge of the tigersin India, as we sit here. Exactly what do we mean by saying that we here know the tigers? What is the precise fact thatthe cognition so confidently claimed is known-as, to use Shadworth Hodgson's inelegant but valuable form of words?Most men would answer that what we mean by knowing the tigers is having them, however absent in body, become insome way present to our thought; or that our knowledge of them is known as presence of our thought to them. A greatmystery is usually made of this peculiar presence in absence; and the scholastic philosophy, which is only commonsense grown pedantic philosophy, which is only common sense grown pedantic, would explain it as a peculiar kind ofexistence, called intentional inexistence, of the tigers in our mind. At the very least, people would say that what wemean by knowing the tigers is mentally pointing towards them as we sit here.But now what do we mean by pointing, in such as case as this? What is the pointing known-as, here?To this question I shall have to give a very prosaic answer—one that traverses the prepossessions not only of commonsense and scholasticism, but also those of nearly all the epistemological writers whom I have ever read. The answer,made brief, is this: The pointing of our thought to the tigers is known simply and solely as a procession of mentalassociates and motor consequences that follow on the thought, and1Extracts from a presidential address before the American Psychological Association, published in the Psychological Review, vol. ii, p.105 (1895)."},{"pageNumber":905,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP854 hl[01 03 2011 15 30 50]Page 854that would lead harmoniously, if followed out, into some ideal or real context, or even into the immediate presence, ofthe tigers. It is known as our rejection of a jaguar, if that beast were shown us as a tiger; as our assent to a genuinetiger if so shown. It is known as our ability to utter all sorts of propositions which don't contradict other propositionsthat are ture of the real tigers. It is even known, if we take the tigers very seriously, as actions of ours which mayterminate in directly intuited tigers, as they would if we took a voyage to India for the purpose of tiger-hunting andbrought back a lot of skins of the striped rascals which we had laid low. In all this there is no self-transcendency inour mental images taken by themselves. They are one phenomenal fact; the tigers are another; and their pointing to thetigers is a perfectly commonplace intra-experiential relation, if you once grant a connecting world to be there. Inshort, the ideas and the tigers are in themselves as loose and separate, to use Hume's language, as any two things canbe; and pointing means here an operation as external and adventitious as any that nature yields.1I hope you may agree with me now that in representative knowledge there is no special inner mystery, but only anouter chain of physical or mental intermediaries connecting thought and thing. To know an object is here to lead to itthrough a context which the world supplies. All this was most instructively set forth by our colleague D. S. Miller atour meeting in New York last Christmas, and for re-confirming my sometime wavering opinion, I owe him thisacknowledgement.2Let us next pass on to the case of immediate or intuitive acquaintance with an object, and let the object be the whitepaper before our eyes. The thought-stuff and the thing-stuff1A stone in one field may 'fit,' we say, a hole in another field. But the relation of 'fitting,' so long as no one carries the stone to the holeand drops it in, is only one name for the fact that such an act may happen. Similarly with the knowing of the tigers here and now. It isonly an anticipatory name for a further associative and terminative process that may occur.2See Dr. Miller's articles on Truth and Error, and on Content and Function, in the Philosophical Review, July, 1893, and Nov., 1895."},{"pageNumber":906,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP855 hl[01 03 2011 15 31 58]Page 855are here indistinguishably the same in nature, as we saw a moment since, and there is no context of intermediaries orassociates to stand between and separate the thought and thing. There is no 'presence in absence' here, and no'pointing,' but rather an allround embracing of the paper by the thought; and it is clear that the knowing cannot now beexplained exactly as it was when the tigers were its object. Dotted all through our experience are states of immediateacquaintance just like this. Somewhere our belief always does rest on ultimate data like the whiteness, smoothness, orsquareness of this paper. Whether such qualities be truly ultimate aspects of being, or only provisional suppositions ofours, held-to till we get better informed, is quite immaterial for our present inquiry. So long as it is believed in, we seeour object face to face. What now do we mean by 'knowing' such a sort of object as this? For this is also the way inwhich we should know the tiger if our conceptual idea of him were to terminate by having led us to his lair?This address must not become too long, so I must give my answer in the fewest words. And let me first say this: Sofar as the white paper or other ultimate datum of our experience is considered to enter also into some one else'sexperience, and we, in knowing it, are held to know it there as well as here; so far, again, as it is considered to be amere mask for hidden molecules that other now impossible experiences of our own might some day lay bare to view;so far it is a case of tigers in India again—the things known being absent experiences, the knowing can only consist inpassing smoothly towards them through the intermediary context that the world supplies. But if our own private visionof the paper be considered in abstraction from every other event, as if it constituted by itself the universe (and it mightperfectly well do so, for aught we can understand to the contrary), then the paper seen and the seeing of it are onlytwo names for one indivisible fact which, properly named, is the datum, the phenomenon, or the experience. The paperis in the mind and the mind is around the paper, because paper and mind are only two names that are given later to theone experience, when taken in a larger world of which it forms a part, its connec-"},{"pageNumber":907,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi %20jP 856 h l[01 03 2011 15 33 05]Page 856tions are traced in different directions.1 To know immediately, then, or intuitively, is for mental content and object tobe identical. This is a very different definition from that which we gave of representative knowledge; but neitherdefinition involves those mysterious notions of self-transcendency and presence in absence which are such essentialparts of the ideas of knowledge, both of philosophers and of common men.21What is meant by this is that 'the experience' can be referred to either of two great associative systems, that of the experiencer's mentalhistory, or that of the experienced facts of the world. Of both of these systems it forms part, and may be regarded, indeed, as one of theirpoints of intersection. Onemight let a vertical line stand for the mental history; but the same object, O, appears also in the mental history of different persons,represented by the other vertical lines. It thus ceases to be the private property of one experience, and becomes, so to speak, a shared or publicthing. We can track its outer history in this way, and represent it by the horizontal line. [It is also known representatively at other points of thevertical lines, or intuitively there again, so that the line of its outer history would have to be looped and wandering, but I make it straight forsimplicity's sake.] In any case, however, it is the same stuff that figures in all the sets of lines.2[The reader will observe that the text is written from the point of view of naïf realism or common sense, and avoids raising the idealisticcontroversy.]"},{"pageNumber":908,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP857 hl[01 03 2011 15 34 30]Page 857IIIHumanism and Truth1Receiving from the Editor of Mind an advance proof of Mr. Bradley's article on 'Truth and Practice,' I understand thisas a hint to me to join in the controversy over 'Pragmatism' which seems to have seriously begun. As my name hasbeen coupled with the movement, I deem it wise to take the hint, the more so as in some quarters greater credit hasbeen given me than I deserve, and probably underserved discredit in other quarters falls also to my lot.First, as to the word 'Pragmatism.' I myself have only used the term to indicate a method of carrying on abstractdiscussion. The serious meaning of a concept, says Mr. Peirce, lies in the concrete difference to some one which itsbeing true will make. Strive to bring all debated conceptions to that 'Pragmatic' test, and you will escape vainwrangling: if it can make no practical difference which of two statements be true, then they are really one statement intwo verbal forms; if it can make no practical difference whether a given statement be true or false, then the statementhas no real meaning. In neither case is there anything fit to quarrel about: we may save our breath, and pass to moreimportant things.All that the pragmatic method implies, then, is that truths should have practical2 consequences. In England the wordhas been used more broadly still, to cover the notion that the truth of any statement consist in the consequences, andparticularly in their being good consequences. Here we get beyond affairs of method altogether; and since mypragmatism and this wider pragmatism are so different, and both are important enough to have different names, Ithink that Mr. Schiller's proposal to call the wider pragmatism by the name of 'humanism' is excellent and ought to beadopted. The1Reprinted, with slight verbal revision, from Mind, vol. xiii, N. S., p. 457 (October, 1904).

I thinkthat a free discussion of the subject on my part would in any case be more useful than a polemic attempt at rebuttingthese criticisms in detail. Mr. Bradley in particular can be taken care of by Mr. Schiller. He repeatedly confesseshimself unable to comprehend Schiller's views, he evidently has not sought to do so sympathetically, and I deeplyregret to say that his laborious article throws, for my mind, absolutely no useful light upon the subject. It seems to meon the whole an ignoratio elenchi, and I feel free to disregard it altogether.The subject is unquestionably difficult. Messrs. Dewey's and Schiller's thought is eminently an induction, ageneralization working itself free from all sorts of entangling particulars. If true, it involves much restatement oftraditional notions. This is a kind of intellectual product that never attains a classic form of expression when firstpromulgated. The critic ought therefore not to be too sharp and logic-chopping in his dealings with it, but shouldweigh it as a whole, and especially weigh it against its possible alternatives. One should also try to apply it first to oneinstance, and then to another to see how it will work. It seems to me that it is emphatically not a case for instantexecution, by conviction of intrinsic absurdity or of self-contradiction, or by caricature of what it would look like ifreduced to skeleton shape. Humanism is in fact much more like one of those secular changes that come upon publicopinion overnight, as it were, borne upon tides 'too deep for sound or foam,' that survive all the crudities andextravagances of their advocates, that you can pin to no one absolutely essential statement, nor kill by any onedecisive stab.Such have been the changes from aristocracy to democracy, from classic to romantic taste, from theistic to pantheisticfeeling, from static to evolutionary ways of understanding life—changes of which we all have been spectators.Scholasticism"},{"pageNumber":910,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP859 hl[01 03 2011 15 36 44]Page 859still opposes to such changes the method of confutation by single decisive reasons, showing that the new viewinvolves self-contradiction, or traverses some fundamental principle. This is like stopping a river by planting a stick inthe middle of its bed. Round your obstacle flows the water and 'gets there all the same.' In reading some of ouropponents, I am not a little reminded of those catholic writers who refute darwinism by telling us that higher speciescannot come from lower because minus nequit gignere plus, or that the notion of transformation is absurd, for itimplies that species tend to their own destruction, and that would violate the principle that every reality tends topersevere in its own shape. The point of view is too myopic, too tight and close to take in the inductive argument.Wide generalizations in science always meet with these summary refutations in their early days; but they outlive them,and the refutations then sound oddly antiquated and scholastic. I cannot help suspecting that the humanistic theory isgoing through this kind of would-be refutation at present.The one condition of understanding humanism is to become inductive-minded oneself, to drop rigorous definitions,and follow lines of least resistance 'on the whole.' 'In other words,' an opponent might say, 'resolve your intellect intoa kind of slush.' 'Even so,' I make reply,—'if you will consent to use no politer word.' For humanism, conceiving themore 'true' as the more 'satisfactory' (Dewey's term), has sincerely to renounce rectilinear arguments and ancient idealsof rigor and finality. It is in just this temper of renunciation, so different from that of pyrrhonistic scepticism, that thespirit of humanism essentially consists. Satisfactoriness has to be measured by a multitude of standards, of whichsome, for aught we know, may fail in any given case; and what is more satisfactory than any alternative in sight, mayto the end be a sum of pluses and minuses, concerning which we can only trust that by ulterior corrections andimprovements a maximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day be approached. It means a realchange of heart, a break with absolutistic hopes, when one takes up this inductive view of the conditions of belief.As I understand the pragmatist way of seeing things, it"},{"pageNumber":911,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP860 hl[01 03 2011 15 37 52]Page 860owes its being to the break-down which the last fifty years have brought about in the older notions of scientific truth.'God geometrizes,' it used to be said; and it was believed that Euclid's elements literally reproduced his geometrizing.There is an eternal and unchangeable 'reason'; and its voice was supposed to reverberate in Barbara and Celarent. Soalso of the 'laws of nature,' physical and chemical, so of natural history classifications—all were supposed to be exactand exclusive duplicates of pre-human archetypes buried in the structure of things, to which the spark of divinityhidden in our intellect enables us to penetrate. The anatomy of the world is logical, and its logic is that of a universityprofessor, it was thought. Up to about 1850 almost every one believed that sciences expressed truths that were exactcopies of a definite code of non-human realities. But the enormously rapid multiplication of theories in these latterdays has well-nigh upset the notion of any one of them being a more literally objective kind of thing than another.There are so many geometries, so many logics, so many physical and chemical hypotheses, so many classifications,each one of them good for so much and yet not good for everything, that the notion that even the truest formula maybe a human device and not a literal transcript has dawned upon us. We hear scientific laws now treated as so much'conceptual shorthand,' true so far as they are useful but no father. Our mind has become tolerant of symbol instead ofreproduction, of approximation instead of exactness, of plasticity instead of rigor. 'Energetics,' measuring the bare faceof sensible phenomena so as to describe in a single formula all their changes of 'level,' is the last word of thisscientific humanism, which indeed leaves queries enough outstanding as to the reason for so curious a congruencebetween the world and the mind, but which at any rate makes our whole notion of scientific truth more flexible andgenial than it used to be.It is to be doubted whether any theorizer to-day, either in mathematics, logic, physics or biology, conceives himself tobe literally re-editing processes of nature or thoughts of God. The main forms of our thinking, the separation ofsubjects from predicates, the negative, hypothetic and disjunctive judgments, are purely human habits.

Dewey's andSchiller's views. The suspicion is in the air nowadays that the superiority of one of our formulas to another may notconsist so much in its literal 'objectivity,' as in subjective qualities like its usefulness, its 'elegance,' or its congruitywith our residual beliefs. Yielding to these suspicions, and generalizing, we fall into something like the humanisticstate of mind. Truth we conceive to mean everywhere, not duplication, but addition; not the constructing of innercopies of already complete realities, but rather the collaborating with realities so as to bring about a clearer result.Obviously this state of mind is at first full of vagueness and ambiguity. 'Collaborating' is a vague term; it must at anyrate cover conceptions and logical arrangements. 'Clearer' is vaguer still. Truth must bring clear thoughts, as well asclear the way to action. 'Reality' is the vaguest term of all. The only way to test such a programme at all is to apply itto the various types of truth, in the hope of reaching an account that shall be more precise. Any hypothesis that forcessuch a review upon one has one great merit, even if in the end it prove invalid: it gets us better acquainted with thetotal subject. To give the theory plenty of 'rope' and see if it hangs itself eventually is better tactics than to choke it offat the outset by abstract accusations of self-contradiction. I think therefore that a decided effort at sympathetic mentalplay with humanism is the provisional attitude to be recommended to the reader.When I find myself playing sympathetically with humanism, something like what follows is what I end by conceivingit to mean.Experience is a process that continually gives us new material to digest. We handle this intellectually by the mass ofbeliefs of which we find ourselves already possessed, assimilating, rejecting, or rearranging in different degrees. Someof the apperceiving ideas are recent acquisitions of our own, but most of them are common-sense traditions of the"},{"pageNumber":913,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP862 hl[01 03 2011 15 40 06]Page 862race. There is probably not a common-sense tradition, of all those which we now live by, that was not in the firstinstance a genuine discovery, an inductive generalization like those more recent ones of the atom, of inertia, ofenergy, of reflex action, or of fitness to survive. The notions of one Time and of one Space as single continuousreceptacles; the distinction between thoughts and things, matter and mind; between permanent subjects and changingattributes; the conception of classes with sub-classes within them; the separation of fortuitous from regularly causedconnections; surely all these were once definite conquests made at historic dates by our ancestors in their attempts toget the chaos of their crude individual experiences into a more shareable and manageable shape. They proved of suchsovereign use as denkmittel that they are now a part of the very structure of our mind. We cannot play fast and loosewith them. No experience can upset them. On the contrary, they apperceive every experience and assign it to its place.To what effect? That we may the better foresee the course of our experiences, communicate with one another, andsteer our lives by rule. Also that we may have a cleaner, clearer, more inclusive mental view.The greatest common-sense achievement, after the discovery of one Time and one Space, is probably the concept ofpermanently existing things. When a rattle first drops out of the hand of a baby, he does not look to see where it hasgone. Non-perception he accepts as annihilation until he finds a better belief. That our perceptions mean beings,rattles that are there whether we hold them in our hands or not, becomes an interpretation so luminous of whathappens to us that, once employed, it never gets forgotten. It applies with equal felicity to things and persons, to theobjective and to the ejective realm. However a Berkeley, a Mill, or a Cornelius may criticise it, it works; and inpractical life we never think of 'going back' upon it, or reading our incoming experiences in any other terms. We may,indeed, speculatively imagine a state of 'pure' experience before the hypothesis of permanent objects behind its fluxhad been framed; and we can play with the idea that some primeval genius might have struck into a differenthypothesis. But we cannot positively imagine to-day"},{"pageNumber":914,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP863 hl[01 03 2011 15 41 14]Page 863what the different hypothesis could have been, for the category of trans-perceptual reality is now one of thefoundations of our life. Our thoughts must still employ it if they are to possess reasonableness and truth.This notion of a first in the shape of a most chaotic pure experience which sets us questions, of a second in the way offundamental categories, long ago wrought into the structure of our consciousness and practically irreversible, whichdefine the general frame within which answers must fall, and of a third which gives the detail of the answers in theshapes most congruous with all our present needs, is, as I take it, the essence of the humanistic conception. Itrepresents experience in its pristine purity to be now so enveloped in predicates historically worked out that we canthink of it as little more than an Other, of a That, which the mind, in Mr. Bradley's phrase, 'encounters,' and to whosestimulating presence we respond by ways of thinking which we call 'true' in proportion as they facilitate our mental orphysical activities and bring us outer power and inner peace. But whether the Other, the universal That, has itself anydefinite inner structure, or whether, if it have any, the structure resembles any of our predicated whats, this is aquestion which humanism leaves untouched. For us, at any rate, it insists, reality is an accumulation of our ownintellectual inventions, and the struggle for 'truth' in our progressive dealings with it is always a struggle to work innew nouns and adjectives while altering as little as possible the old.It is hard to see why either Mr. Bradley's own logic or his metaphysics should oblige him to quarrel with thisconception. He might consistently adopt it verbatim et literatim, if he would, and simply throw his peculiar absoluteround it, following in this the good example of Professor Royce. Bergson in France, and his disciples, Wilbois thephysicist and Leroy, are thoroughgoing humanists in the sense defined. Professor Milhaud also appears to be one; andthe great Poincaré misses it by only the breadth of a hair. In Germany the name of Simmel offers itself as that of ahumanist of the most radical sort. Mach and his school, and Hertz and Ostwald must be classed as humanists. Theview is in the atmosphere and must be patiently discussed."},{"pageNumber":915,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP864 hl[01 03 2011 15 42 21]Page 864The best way to discuss it would be to see what the alternative might be. What is it indeed? Its critics make no explicitstatement, Professor Royce being the only one so far who has formulated anything definite. The first service ofhumanism to philosophy accordingly seems to be that it will probably oblige those who dislike it to search their ownhearts and heads. It will force analysis to the front and make it the order of the day. At present the lazy tradition thattruth is adequatio intellectûs et rei seems all there is to contradict it with. Mr. Bradley's only suggestion is that truethought 'must correspond to a determinate being which it cannot be said to make,' and obviously that sheds no newlight. What is the meaning of the word to 'correspond'? Where is the 'being'? What sort of things are 'determinations,'and what is meant in this particular case by 'not to make'?Humanism proceeds immediately to refine upon the looseness of these epithets. We correspond in some way withanything with which we enter into any relations at all. If it be a thing, we may produce an exact copy of it, or we maysimply feel it as an existent in a certain place. If it be a demand, we may obey it without knowing anything more aboutit than its push. If it be a proposition, we may agree by not contradicting it, by letting it pass. If it be a relationbetween things, we may act on the first thing so as to bring ourselves out where the second will be. If it be somethinginaccessible, we may substitute a hypothetical object for it, which, having the same consequences, will cipher out forus real results. In a general way we may simply add our thought to it; and if it suffers the addition, and the wholesituation harmoniously prolongs and enriches itself, the thought will pass for true.As for the whereabouts of the beings thus corresponded to, although they may be outside of the present thought aswell as in it, humanism sees no ground for saying they are outside of finite experience itself. Pragmatically, theirreality means that we submit to them, take account of them, whether we like to or not, but this we must perpetually dowith experiences other than our own.

Its determinations for us are in any case the adjectives which our acts of judging fit to it, and those areessentially humanistic things.To say that our thought does not 'make' this reality means pragmatically that if our own particular thought wereannihilated the reality would still be there in some shape, though possibly it might be a shape that would lacksomething that our thought supplies. That reality is 'independent' means that there is something in every experiencethat escapes our arbitrary control. If it be a sensible experience it coerces our attention; if a sequence, we cannot invertit; if we compare two terms we can come to only one result. There is a push, an urgency, within our very experience,against which we are on the whole powerless, and which drives us in a direction that is the destiny of our belief. Thatthis drift of experience itself is in the last resort due to something independent of all possible experience may or maynot be true. There may or may not be an extra-experiential 'ding an sich' that keeps the ball rolling, or an 'absolute'that lies eternally behind all the successive determinations which human thought has made. But within our experienceitself, at any rate, humanism says, some determinations show themselves as being independent of others; somequestions, if we ever ask them, can only be answered in one way; some beings, if we ever suppose them, must besupposed to have existed previously to the supposing; some relations, if they exist ever, must exist as long as theirterms exist.Truth thus means, according to humanism, the relation of less fixed parts of experience (predicates) to other relativelymore fixed parts (subjects); and we are not required to seek it in a relation of experience as such to anything beyonditself. We can stay at home, for our behavior as experients is hemmed in on every side. The forces both of advanceand of resistance are exerted by our own objects, and the notion of truth as something opposed to waywardness orlicense inevitably grows up solipsistically inside of every human life.So obvious is all this that a common charge against the"},{"pageNumber":917,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP866 hl[01 03 2011 15 44 37]Page 866humanistic authors 'makes me tired.' 'How can a deweyite discriminate sincerity from bluff?' was a question asked ata philosophic meeting where I reported on Dewey's Studies. 'How can the mere1 pragmatist feel any duty to thinktruly?' is the objection urged by Professor Royce. Mr. Bradley in turn says that if a humanist understands his owndoctrine, 'he must hold any idea, however mad, to be the truth, if any one will have it so.' And Professor Taylordescribes pragmatism as believing anything one pleases and calling it truth.Such a shallow sense of the conditions under which men's thinking actually goes on seems to me most surprising.These critics appear to suppose that, if left to itself, the rudderless raft of our experience must be ready to driftanywhere or nowhere. Even tho there were compasses on board, they seem to say, there would be no pole for them topoint to. There must be absolute sailing-directions, they insist, decreed from outside, and an independent chart of thevoyage added to the 'mere' voyage itself, if we are ever to make a port. But is it not obvious that even tho there besuch absolute sailing-directions in the shape of pre-human standards of truth that we ought to follow, the onlyguarantee that we shall in fact follow them must lie in our human equipment. The 'ought' would be a brutum fulmenunless there were a felt grain inside of our experience that conspired. As a matter of fact the devoutest believers inabsolute standards must admit that men fail to obey them. Waywardness is here, in spite of the eternal prohibitions,and the existence of any amount of reality anterem is no warrant against unlimited error in rebus being incurred. Theonly real guarantee we have against licentious thinking is the circumpressure of experience itself, which gets us sickof concrete errors, whether there be a trans-empirical reality or not. How does the partisan of absolute reality knowwhat this orders him to think? He cannot get direct sight of the absolute; and he has no means of guessing what itwants of him except by following the humanistic clues. The only truth that he himself will ever practically accept willbe that to which his finite experiences lead him of themselves. The state of mind which shudders at the idea of a lot ofexperiences left1I know of no 'mere' pragmatist, if mereness here means, as it seems to, the denial of all concreteness to the pragmatist's thought."},{"pageNumber":918,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP867 hl[01 03 2011 15 45 45]Page 867to themselves, and that augurs protection from the sheer name of an absolute, as if, however inoperative, that mightstill stand for a sort of ghostly security, is like the mood of those good people who, whenever they hear of a socialtendency that is damnable, begin to redden and to puff, and say 'Parliament or Congress ought to make a law againstit,' as if an impotent decree would give relief.All the sanctions of a law of truth lie in the very texture of experience. Absolute or no absolute, the concrete truth forus will always be that way of thinking in which our various experiences most profitably combine.And yet, the opponent obstinately urges, your humanist will always have a greater liberty to play fast and loose withtruth than will your believer in an independent realm of reality that makes the standard rigid. If by this latter believerhe means a man who pretends to know the standard and who fulminates it, the humanist will doubtless prove moreflexible; but no more flexible than the absolutist himself if the latter follows (as fortunately our present-day absolutistsdo follow) empirical methods of inquiry in concrete affairs. To consider hypotheses is surely always better than todogmatize ins blaue hinein.Nevertheless this probable flexibility of temper in him has been used to convict the humanist of sin. Believing as hedoes, that truth lies in rebus, and is at every moment our own line of most propitious reaction, he stands foreverdebarred, as I have heard a learned colleague say, from trying to convert opponents, for does not their view, beingtheir most propitious momentary reaction, already fill the bill? Only the believer in the ante-rem brand of truth can onthis theory seek to make converts without self-stultification. But can there be self-stultification in urging any accountwhatever of truth? Can the definition ever contradict the deed? 'Truth is what I feel like saying'—suppose that to bethe definition. 'Well, I feel like saying that, and I want you to feel like saying it, and shall continue to say it until I getyou to agree.' Where is there any contradiction? Whatever truth may be said to be, that is the kind of truth which thesaying can be held to carry. The temper which a saying may comport is an extra-logical matter.

And the humanist, for his part, is perfectly consistent incompassing sea and land to make one proselyte, if his nature be enthusiastic enough.'But how can you be enthusiastic over any view of things which you know to have been partly made by yourself, andwhich is liable to alter during the next minute? How is any heroic devotion to the ideal of truth possible under suchpaltry conditions?'This is just another of those objections by which the antihumanists show their own comparatively slack hold on therealities of the situation. If they would only follow the pragmatic method and ask: 'What is truth known-as? What doesits existence stand for in the way of concrete goods?'—they would see that the name of it is the inbegriff of almosteverything that is valuable in our lives. The true is the opposite of whatever is instable, of whatever is practicallydisappointing, of whatever is useless, of whatever is lying and unreliable, of whatever is unverifiable and unsupported,of whatever is inconsistent and contradictory, of whatever is artificial and eccentric, of whatever is unreal in the senseof being of no practical account. Here are pragmatic reasons with a vengeance why we should turn to truth—truthsaves us from a world of that complexion. What wonder that its very name awakens loyal feeling! In particular whatwonder that all little provisional fool's paradises of belief should appear contemptible in comparison with its barepursuit! When absolutists reject humanism because they feel it to be untrue, that means that the whole habit of theirmental needs is wedded already to a different view of reality, in comparison with which the humanistic world seemsbut the whim of a few irresponsible youths. Their own subjective apperceiving mass is what speaks here in the nameof the eternal natures and bids them reject our humanism—as they apprehend it. Just so with us humanists, when wecondemn all noble, clean-cut, fixed, eternal, rational, temple-like systems of philosophy. These contradict the dramatictemperament of nature, as our dealings with nature and our habits of thinking have so far brought us to conceive it.They seem oddly personal and artificial, even when not bureaucratic and professional in an absurd degree."},{"pageNumber":920,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP869 hl[01 03 2011 15 48 00]Page 869We turn from them to the great unpent and unstayed wilderness of truth as we feel it to be constituted, with as good aconscience as rationalists are moved by when they turn from our wilderness into their neater and cleaner intellectualabodes.1This is surely enough to show that the humanist does not ignore the character of objectivity and independence in truth.Let me turn next to what his opponents mean when they say that to be true, our thoughts must 'correspond.'The vulgar notion of correspondence here is that the thoughts must copy the reality—cognitio fit per assimiliationemcogniti et cognoscentis; and philosophy, without having ever fairly sat down to the question, seems to haveinstinctively accepted this idea: propositions are held true if they copy the eternal thought; terms are held true if theycopy extra-mental realities. Implicitly, I think that the copy-theory has animated most of the criticisms that have beenmade on humanism.A priori, however, it is not self-evident that the sole business of our mind with realities should be to copy them. Letmy reader suppose himself to constitute for a time all the reality there is in the universe, and then to receive theannouncement that another being is to be created who shall know him truly. How will he represent the knowing inadvance?

I doubt extremely whether it could ever occur to him to fancy it as a mere copying. Of what useto him would an imperfect second edition of himself in the new comer's interior be? It would seem pure waste of apropitious opportunity. The demand would more probably be for something absolutely new. The reader wouldconceive the knowing humanistically, 'the new comer,' he would say, 'must take account of my presence by reactingon it in such a way that good would accrue to us both. If copying be requisite to that end, let there be copying;otherwise not.' The essence in any case would not be the copying, but the enrichment of the previous world.I read the other day, in a book of Professor Eucken's, a phrase, 'Die erhöhung des vorgefundenen daseins,' whichseems to be pertinent here. Why may not thought's mission be to increase and elevate, rather than simply to imitateand reduplicate, existence? No one who has read Lotze can fail to remember his striking comment on the ordinaryview of the secondary qualities of matter, which brands them as 'illusory' because they copy nothing in the thing. Thenotion of a world complete in itself, to which thought comes as a passive mirror, adding nothing to fact, Lotze says isirrational. Rather is thought itself a most momentous part of fact, and the whole mission of the pre-existing andinsufficient world of matter may simply be to provoke thought to produce its far more precious supplement.'Knowing,' in short, may, for aught we can see beforehand to the contrary, be only one way of getting into fruitfulrelations with reality, whether copying be one of the relations or not.It is easy to see from what special type of knowing the copy-theory arose. In our dealings with natural phenomena thegreat point is to be able to foretell. Foretelling, according to such a writer as Spencer, is the whole meaning ofintelligence. When Spencer's 'law of intelligence' says that inner and outer relations must 'correspond,' it means thatthe distribution of terms in our inner time-scheme and space-scheme must be an exact copy of the distribution in realtime and space of the real terms. In strict theory the mental terms themselves need not answer to the real terms in thesense of severally copying them, symbolic mental terms being enough,"},{"pageNumber":922,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP871 hl[01 03 2011 15 50 15]Page 871if only the real dates and places be copied. But in our ordinary life the mental terms are images and the real ones aresensations, and the images so often copy the sensations, that we easily take copying of terms as well as of relations tobe the natural significance of knowing. Meanwhile much, even of this common descriptive truth, is couched in verbalsymbols. If our symbols fit the world, in the sense of determining our expectations rightly, they may even be thebetter for not copying its terms.It seems obvious that the pragmatic account of all this routine of phenomenal knowledge is accurate. Truth here is arelation, not of our ideas to non-human realities, but of conceptual parts of our experience to sensational parts. Thosethoughts are true which guide us to beneficial interaction with sensible particulars as they occur, whether they copythese in advance or not.From the frequency of copying in the knowledge of phenomenal fact, copying has been supposed to be the essence oftruth in matters rational also. Geometry and logic, it has been supposed, must copy archetypal thoughts in the Creator.But in these abstract spheres there is no need of assuming archetypes. The mind is free to carve so many figures out ofspace, to make so many numerical collections, to frame so many classes and series, and it can analyze and compare soendlessly, that the very superabundance of the resulting ideas makes us doubt the 'objective' pre-existence of theirmodels. It would be plainly wrong to suppose a God whose thought consecrated rectangular but not polar co-ordinates, or Jevons's notation but not Boole's. Yet if, on the other hand, we assume God to have thought in advanceof every possible flight of human fancy in these directions, his mind becomes too much like a Hindoo idol with threeheads, eight arms and six breasts, too much made up of superf tation and redundancy for us to wish to copy it, and thewhole notion of copying tends to evaporate from these sciences. Their objects can be better interpreted as beingcreated step by step by men, as fast as they successively conceive them.If now it be asked how, if triangles, squares, square roots, genera, and the like, are but improvised human 'artefacts,'"},{"pageNumber":923,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP872 hl[01 03 2011 15 51 22]Page 872their properties and relations can be so promptly known to be 'eternal,' the humanistic answer is easy. If triangles andgenera are of our own production we can keep them invariant. We can make them 'timeless' by expressly decreeingthat on the things we mean time shall exert no altering effect, that they are intentionally and it may be fictitiouslyabstracted from every corrupting real associate and condition. But relations between invariant objects will themselvesbe invariant. Such relations cannot be happenings, for by hypothesis nothing shall happen to the objects. I have triedto show in the last chapter of my Principles of Psychology1 that they can only be relations of comparison. No one sofar seems to have noticed my suggestion, and I am too ignorant of the development of mathematics to feel veryconfident of my own view. But if it were correct it would solve the difficulty perfectly. Relations of comparison arematters of direct inspection. As soon as mental objects are mentally compared, they are perceived to be either like orunlike. But once the same, always the same, once different, always different, under these timeless conditions. Whichis as much as to say that truths concerning these man-made objects are necessary and eternal. We can change ourconclusions only by changing our data first.The whole fabric of the a priori sciences can thus be treated as a man-made product. As Locke long ago pointed out,these sciences have no immediate connection with fact. Only if a fact can be humanized by being identified with anyof these ideal objects, is what was true of the objects now true also of the facts. The truth itself meanwhile wasoriginally a copy of nothing; it was only a relation directly perceived to obtain between two artificial mental things.2We may now glance at some special types of knowing, so as to see better whether the humanistic account fits. On themathematical and logical types we need not enlarge further, nor need we return at much length to the case of ourdescriptive knowledge of the course of nature. So far as this involves anticipation, tho that may mean copying, it need,as we saw, mean little more than 'getting ready' in advance. But with1Vol. ii, pp. 641 ff.2[Mental things which are realities of course within the mental world.]"},{"pageNumber":924,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP873 hl[01 03 2011 15 52 29]Page 873many distant and future objects, our practical relations are to the last degree potential and remote. In no sense can wenow get ready for the arrest of the earth's revolution by the tidal brake, for instance; and with the past, tho we supposeourselves to know it truly, we have no practical relations at all. It is obvious that, altho interests strictly practical havebeen the original starting-point of our search for true phenomenal descriptions, yet an intrinsic interest in the baredescribing function has grown up. We wish accounts that shall be true, whether they bring collateral profit or not. Theprimitive function has developed its demand for mere exercise. This theoretic curiosity seems to be thecharacteristically human differentia, and humanism recognizes its enormous scope. A true idea now means not onlyone that prepares us for an actual perception. It means also one that might prepare us for a merely possible perception,or one that, if spoken, would suggest possible perceptions to others, or suggest actual perceptions which the speakercannot share. The ensemble of perceptions thus thought of as either actual or possible form a system which it isobviously advantageous to us to get into a stable and consistent shape; and here it is that the commonsense notion ofpermanent beings finds triumphant use. Beings acting outside of the thinker explain, not only his actual perceptions,past and future, but his possible perceptions and those of every one else. Accordingly they gratify our theoretic needin a supremely beautiful way. We pass from our immediate actual through them into the foreign and the potential, andback again into the future actual, accounting for innumerable particulars by a single cause. As in those circularpanoramas, where a real foreground of dirt, grass, bushes, rocks and a broken-down cannon is enveloped by a canvaspicture of sky and earth and of a raging battle, continuing the foreground so cunningly that the spectator can detect nojoint; so these conceptual objects, added to our present perceptual reality, fuse with it into the whole universe of ourbelief. In spite of all berkeleyan criticism, we do not doubt that they are really there. Tho our discovery of any one ofthem may only date from now, we unhesitatingly say that it not only is, but was there, if, by so saying, the pastappears connected more consistently with what we feel the present to"},{"pageNumber":925,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP874 hl[01 03 2011 15 53 37]Page 874be. This is historic truth. Moses wrote the Pentateuch, we think, because if he did n't, all our religious habits will haveto be undone. Julius Cæsar was real, or we can never listen to history again. Trilobites were once alive, or all ourthought about the strata is at sea. Radium, discovered only yesterday, must always have existed, or its analogy withother natural elements, which are permanent, fails. In all this, it is but one portion of our beliefs reacting on another soas to yield the most satisfactory total state of mind. That state of mind, we say, sees truth, and the content of itsdeliverances we believe.Of course, if you take the satisfactoriness concretely, as something felt by you now, and if, by truth, you mean truthtaken abstractly and verified in the long run, you cannot make them equate, for it is notorious that the temporarilysatisfactory is often false. Yet at each and every concrete moment, truth for each man is what that man 'troweth' at thatmoment with the maximum of satisfaction to himself; and similarly, abstract truth, truth verified by the long run, andabstract satisfactoriness, long-run satisfactoriness, coincide. If, in short, we compare concrete with concrete andabstract with abstract, the true and the satisfactory do mean the same thing. I suspect that a certain muddling ofmatters hereabouts is what makes the general philosophic public so impervious to humanism's claims.The fundamental fact about our experience is that it is a process of change. For the 'trower' at any moment, truth, likethe visible area round a man walking in a fog, or like what George Eliot calls 'the wall of dark seen by small fishes'eyes that pierce a span in the wide Ocean,' is an objective field which the next moment enlarges and of which it is thecritic, and which then either suffers alteration or is continued unchanged. The critic sees both the first trower's truthand his own truth, compares them with each other, and verifies or confutes. His field of view is the realityindependent of that earlier trower's thinking with which that thinking ought to correspond. But the critic is himselfonly a trower; and if the whole process of experience should terminate at that instant, there would be no otherwiseknown independent reality with which his thought might be compared.The immediate in experience is always provisionally in this"},{"pageNumber":926,"pageContent":"file:///E|/Tarama/MM3/Dosyalar/netlibrary/www com/nlreader/nlreader dll%253fbookid=17005&filename=Page 875 html[01 03 2011 22:17:14]Page 875situation. The humanism, for instance, which I see and try so hard to defend, is the completest truth attained from mypoint of view up to date. But, owing to the fact that all experience is a process, no point of view can ever be the lastone. Every one is insufficient and off its balance, and responsible to later points of view than itself. You, occupyingsome of these later points in your own person, and believing in the reality of others, will not agree that my point ofview sees truth positive, truth timeless, truth that counts, unless they verify and confirm what it sees.You generalize this by saying that any opinion, however satisfactory, can count positively and absolutely as true onlyso far as it agrees with a standard beyond itself; and if you then forget that this standard perpetually grows upendogenously inside the web of the experiences, you may carelessly go on to say that what distributively holds of eachexperience, holds also collectively of all experience, and that experience as such and in its totality owes whatevertruth it may be possessed-of to its correspondence with absolute realities outside of its own being. This evidently isthe popular and traditional position. From the fact that finite experiences must draw support from one another,philosophers pass to the notion that experience überhaupt must need an absolute support. The denial of such a notionby humanism lies probably at the root of most of the dislike which it incurs.But is this not the globe, the elephant and the tortoise over again? Must not something end by supporting itself?Humanism is willing to let finite experience be self-supporting. Somewhere being must immediately breast nonentity.Why may not the advancing front of experience, carrying its immanent satisfactions and dissatisfactions, cut againstthe black inane as the luminous orb of the moon cuts the cærulean abyss? Why should anywhere the world beabsolutely fixed and finished? And if reality genuinely grows, why may it not grow in these very determinationswhich here and now are made?In point of fact it actually seems to grow by our mental determinations, be these never so 'true.'

But what do we mean by this projection into past eternity of recent human ways of thinking? Didan 'absolute' thinker actually do the counting, tell off the stars upon his standing number-tally, and make the bear-comparison, silly as the latter is? Were they explicitly seven, explicitly bear-like, before the human witness came?Surely nothing in the truth of the attributions drives us to think this. They were only implicitly or virtually what wecall them, and we human witnesses first explicated them and made them 'real.' A fact virtually pre-exists when everycondition of its realization save one is already there. In this case the condition lacking is the act of the counting andcomparing mind. But the stars (once the mind considers them) themselves dictate the result. The counting in no wisemodifies their previous nature, and, they being what and where they are, the count cannot fall out differently. It couldthen always be made. Never could the number seven be questioned, if the question once were raised.We have here a quasi-paradox. Undeniably something comes by the counting that was not there before. And yet thatsomething was always true. In one sense you create it, and in another sense you find it. You have to treat your countas being true beforehand, the moment you come to treat the matter at all.Our stellar attributes must always be called true, then; yet none the less are they genuine additions made by ourintellect to the world of fact. Not additions of consciousness only, but additions of 'content.' They copy nothing thatpre-existed, yet they agree with what pre-existed, fit it, amplify it, relate and connect it with a 'wain,' a number-tally,or what not, and build it out. It seems to me that humanism is the only theory that builds this case out in the gooddirection, and this case stands for innumerable other kinds of case. In all such cases, odd as it may sound, ourjudgment may actually be said to retroact and to enrich the past.Our judgments at any rate change the character of future reality by the acts to which they lead.

But the pathos of this expression should not blind us to the complication of the facts. Idoubt whether Professor Taylor would himself be in favor of practically handling trusters of these kinds as liars.Future and present really mix in such emergencies, and one can always escape lies in them by using hypothetic forms.But Mr. Taylor's attitude suggests such absurd possibilities of practice that it seems to me to illustrate beautifully howself-stultifying the conception of a truth that shall merely register a standing fixture may become. Theoretic truth,truth of passive copying, sought in the sole interests of copying as such, not because copying is good for something,but because copying ought schlechthin to be, seems, if you look at it coldly, to be an almost preposterous ideal. Whyshould the universe, existing in itself, also exist in copies? How can it be copied in the solidity of its objectivefulness? And even if it could, what would the motive be? 'Even the hairs of your head are numbered.' Doubtless theyare, virtually; but why, as an absolute proposition, ought the number to become copied and known? Surely knowing isonly one way of interacting with reality and adding to its effect.The opponent here will ask: 'Has not the knowing of truth any substantive value on its own account, apart from thecollateral advantages it may bring? And if you allow theoretic satisfactions to exist at all, do they not crowd thecollateral satisfactions out of house and home, and must not pragmatism go into bankruptcy, if she admits them at all?'The destructive force of such talk disappears as soon as we use words concretely instead of abstractly, and ask, in ourquality of1In an article criticising Pragmatism (as he conceives it) in the McGill University Quarterly published at Montreal, for May, 1904."},{"pageNumber":929,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP878 hl[01 03 2011 15 55 52]Page 878good pragmatists, just what the famous theoretic needs are known as and in what the intellectual satisfactions consist.Are they not all mere matters of consistency—and emphatically not of consistency between an absolute reality and themind's copies of it, but of actually felt consistency among judgments, objects, and habits of reacting, in the mind'sown experienceable world? And are not both our need of such consistency and our pleasure in it conceivable asoutcomes of the natural fact that we are beings that do develop mental habits—habit itself proving adaptivelybeneficial in an environment where the same objects, or the same kinds of objects, recur and follow 'law'? If this wereso, what would have come first would have been the collateral profits of habit as such, and the theoretic life wouldhave grown up in aid of these. In point of fact, this seems to have been the probable case. At life's origin, any presentperception may have been 'true'—if such a word could then be applicable. Later, when reactions became organized,the reactions became 'true' whenever expectation was fulfilled by them. Otherwise they were 'false' or 'mistaken'reactions. But the same class of objects needs the same kind of reaction, so the impulse to react consistently mustgradually have been established, and a disappointment felt whenever the results frustrated expectation. Here is aperfectly plausible germ for all our higher consistencies. Nowadays, if an object claims from us a reaction of the kindhabitually accorded only to the opposite class of objects, our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly. The situationis intellectually unsatisfactory.Theoretic truth thus falls within the mind, being the accord of some of its processes and objects with other processesand objects—'accord' consisting here in well-definable relations. So long as the satisfaction of feeling such an accordis denied us, whatever collateral profits may seem to inure from what we believe in are but as dust in the balance—provided always that we are highly organized intellectually, which the majority of us are not. The amount of accordwhich satisfies most men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between their usual thoughts andstatements and the limited sphere of sense-perceptions in which their lives are cast.

The form of inner consistency is pursued far beyond theline at which collateral profits stop. Such men systematize and classify and schematize and make synoptical tables andinvent ideal objects for the pure love of unifying. Too often the results, glowing with 'truth' for the inventors, seempathetically personal and artificial to bystanders. Which is as much as to say that the purely theoretic criterion of truthcan leave us in the lurch as easily as any other criterion, and that the absolutists, for all their pretensions, are 'in thesame boat' concretely with those whom they attack.I am well aware that this paper has been rambling in the extreme. But the whole subject is inductive, and sharp logicis hardly yet in order. My great trammel has been the non-existence of any definitely stated alternative on myopponents' part. It may conduce to clearness if I recapitulate, in closing, what I conceive the main points of humanismto be. They are these:—1. An experience, perceptual or conceptual, must conform to reality in order to be true.2. By 'reality' humanism means nothing more than the other conceptual or perceptual experiences with which a givenpresent experience may find itself in point of fact mixed up.13. By 'conforming,' humanism means taking account-of in such a way as to gain any intellectually and practicallysatisfactory result.4. To 'take account-of' and to be 'satisfactory' are terms that admit of no definition, so many are the ways in whichthese requirements can practically be worked out.5. Vaguely and in general, we take account of a reality by preserving it in as unmodified a form as possible. But, tobe then satisfactory, it must not contradict other realities outside of it which claim also to be preserved. That we mustpreserve1This is meant merely to exclude reality of an 'unknowable' sort, of which no account in either perceptual or conceptual terms can begiven. It includes of course any amount of empirical reality independent of the knower. Pragmatism is thus 'epistemologically' realistic inits account."},{"pageNumber":931,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP880 hl[01 03 2011 15 58 08]Page 880all the experience we can and minimize contradiction in what we preserve, is about all that can be said in advance.6. The truth which the conforming experience embodies may be a positive addition to the previous reality, and laterjudgments may have to conform to it. Yet, virtually at least, it may have been true previously. Pragmatically, virtualand actual truth mean the same thing: the possibility of only one answer, when once the question is raised."},{"pageNumber":932,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP881 hl[01 03 2011 15 59 15]Page 881IVThe Relation between Knower and Known1Throughout the history of philosophy the subject and its object have been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities;and thereupon the presence of the latter to the former, or the 'apprehension' by the former of the latter, has assumed aparadoxical character which all sorts of theories had to be invented to overcome. Representative theories put a mental'representation,' 'image,' or 'content' into the gap, as a sort of intermediary. Common-sense theories left the gapuntouched, declaring our mind able to clear it by a self-transcending leap. Transcendentalist theories left it impossibleto traverse by finite knowers, and brought an absolute in to perform the saltatory act. All the while, in the very bosomof the finite experience, every conjunction required to make the relation intelligible is given in full. Either the knowerand the known are:(1) the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different contexts; or they are(2) two pieces of actual experience belonging to the same subject, with definite tracts of conjunctive transitionalexperience between them; or(3) the known is a possible experience either of that subject or another, to which the said conjunctive transitions wouldlead, if sufficiently prolonged.To discuss all the ways in which one experience may function as the knower of another, would be incompatible withthe limits of this essay. I have treated of type 1, the kind of knowledge called perception, in an article in the Journalof Philosophy, for September 1, 1904, called 'Does consciousness exist?' This is the type of case in which the mindenjoys direct 'acquaintance' with a present object. In the other types the mind has 'knowledge-about' an object notimmediately there. Type 3 can always formally and hypothetically be reduced to type 2, so that a brief description ofthat type will now put1Extract from an article entitled 'A World of Pure Experience,' in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., September 29, 1904."},{"pageNumber":933,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP882 hl[01 03 2011 16 00 25]Page 882the present reader sufficiently at my point of view, and make him see what the actual meanings of the mysteriouscognitive relation may be.Suppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge, at ten minutes' walk from 'Memorial Hall,' and to bethinking truly of the latter object. My mind may have before it only the name, or it may have a clear image, or it mayhave a very dim image of the hall, but such an intrinsic difference in the image makes no difference in its cognitivefunction. Certain extrinsic phenomena, special experiences of conjunction, are what impart to the image, be it what itmay, its knowing office.For instance, if you ask me what hall I mean by my image, and I can tell you nothing; or if I fail to point or lead youtowards the Harvard Delta; or if, being led by you, I am uncertain whether the Hall I see be what I had in mind or not;you would rightly deny that I had 'meant' that particular hall at all, even tho my mental image might to some degreehave resembled it. The resemblance would count in that case as coincidental merely, for all sorts of things of a kindresemble one another in this world without being held for that reason to take cognizance of one another.On the other hand, if I can lead you to the hall, and tell you of its history and present uses; if in its presence I feel myidea, however imperfect it may have been, to have led hither and to be now terminated; if the associates of the imageand of the felt hall run parallel, so that each term of the one context corresponds serially, as I walk, with an answeringterm of the other; why then my soul was prophetic, and my idea must be, and by common consent would be, calledcognizant of reality. That percept was what I meant, for into it my idea has passed by conjunctive experiences ofsameness and fulfilled intention. Nowhere is there jar, but every later moment continues and corroborates an earlierone.In this continuing and corroborating, taken in no transcendental sense, but denoting definitely felt transitions, lies allthat the knowing of a percept by an idea can possibly contain or signify. Wherever such transitions are felt, the firstexperience knows the last one. Where they do not, or where even as possibles they can not, intervene, there can be nopretence of"},{"pageNumber":934,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP883 hl[01 03 2011 16 01 32]Page 883knowing. In this latter case the extremes will be connected, if connected at all, by inferior relations—bare likeness orsuccession, or by 'withness' alone. Knowledge of sensible realities thus comes to life inside the tissue of experience. Itis made; and made by relations that unroll themselves in time. Whenever certain intermediaries are given, such that, asthey develop towards their terminus, there is experience from point to point of one direction followed, and finally ofone process fulfilled, the result is that their starting-point thereby becomes a knower and their terminus an objectmeant or known. That is all that knowing (in the simple case considered) can be known-as, that is the whole of itsnature, put into experiential terms. Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences we may freely say that we hadthe terminal object 'in mind' from the outset, even altho at the outset nothing was there in us but a flat piece ofsubstantive experience like any other, with no self-transcendency about it, and no mystery save the mystery of cominginto existence and of being gradually followed by other pieces of substantive experience, with conjunctivelytransitional experiences between. That is what we mean here by the object's being 'in mind.' Of any deeper more realway of its being in mind we have no positive conception, and we have no right to discredit our actual experience bytalking of such a way at all.I know that many a reader will rebel at this. 'Mere intermediaries,' he will say, 'even tho they be feelings ofcontinuously growing fulfilment, only separate the knower from the known, whereas what we have in knowledge is akind of immediate touch of the one by the other, an ''apprehension\" in the etymological sense of the word, a leaping ofthe chasm as by lightning, an act by which two terms are smitten into one over the head of their distinctness. All thesedead intermediaries of yours are out of each other, and outside of their termini still.'But do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping his bone and snapping at its image in the water?If we knew any more real kind of union aliunde, we might be entitled to brand all our empirical unions as a sham. Butunions by continuous transition are the only ones we know of, whether in this matter of a knowledge-about that"},{"pageNumber":935,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP884 hl[01 03 2011 16 02 40]Page 884terminates in an acquaintance, whether in personal identity, in logical predication through the copula 'is,' or elsewhere.If anywhere there were more absolute unions, they could only reveal themselves to us by just such conjunctive results.These are what the unions are worth, these are all that we can ever practically mean by union, by continuity. Is it nottime to repeat what Lotze said of substances, that to act like one is to be one? Should we not say here that to beexperienced as continuous is to be really continuous, in a world where experience and reality come to the same thing?In a picture gallery a painted hook will serve to hang a painted chain by, a painted cable will hold a painted ship. In aworld where both the terms and their distinctions are affairs of experience, conjunctions that are experienced must beat least as real as anything else. They will be 'absolutely' real conjunctions, if we have no transphenomenal absoluteready, to derealize the whole experienced world by, at a stroke.So much for the essentials of the cognitive relation where the knowledge is conceptual in type, or forms knowledge'about' an object. It consists in intermediary experiences (possible, if not actual) of continuously developing progress,and, finally, of fulfilment, when the sensible percept which is the object is reached. The percept here not only verifiesthe concept, proves its function of knowing that percept to be true, but the percept's existence as the terminus of thechain of intermediaries creates the function. Whatever terminates that chain was, because it now proves itself to be,what the concept 'had in mind.'The towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies in the fact that an experience that knows anothercan figure as its representative, not in any quasi-miraculous 'epistemological' sense, but in the definite practical senseof being its substitute in various operations, sometimes physical and sometimes mental, which lead us to its associatesand results. By experimenting on our ideas of reality, we may save ourselves the trouble of experimenting on the realexperiences which they severally mean. The ideas form related systems, corresponding point for point to the systemswhich the realities form; and by letting an ideal term call up its associates"},{"pageNumber":936,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP885 hl[01 03 2011 16 03 47]Page 885systematically, we may be led to a terminus which the corresponding real term would have led to in case we hadoperated on the real world. And this brings us to the general question of substitution.What, exactly, in a system of experiences, does the 'substitution' of one of them for another mean?According to my view, experience as a whole is a process in time, whereby innumerable particular terms lapse andare superseded by others that follow upon them by transitions which, whether disjunctive or conjunctive in content,are themselves experiences, and must in general be accounted at least as real as the terms which they relate. What thenature of the event called 'superseding' signifies, depends altogether on the kind of transition that obtains. Someexperiences simply abolish their predecessors without continuing them in any way. Others are felt to increase or toenlarge their meaning, to carry out their purpose, or to bring us nearer to their goal. They 'represent' them, and mayfulfil their function better than they fulfilled it themselves. But to 'fulfil a function' in a world of pure experience canbe conceived and defined in only one possible way. In such a world transitions and arrivals (or terminations) are theonly events that happen, tho they happen by so many sorts of path. The only function that one experience can performis to lead into another experience; and the only fulfilment we can speak of is the reaching of a certain experiencedend. When one experience leads to (or can lead to) the same end as another, they agree in function. But the wholesystem of experiences as they are immediately given presents itself as a quasi-chaos through which one can pass outof an initial term in many directions and yet end in the same terminus, moving from next to next by a great manypossible paths.Either one of these paths might be a functional substitute for another, and to follow one rather than another might onoccasion be an advantageous thing to do. As a matter of fact, and in a general way, the paths that run throughconceptual experiences, that is, through 'thoughts' or 'ideas' that 'know' the things in which they terminate, are highlyadvantageous paths to follow. Not only do they yield inconceivably rapid"},{"pageNumber":937,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP886 hl[01 03 2011 16 04 54]Page 886transitions; but, owing to the 'universal' character1 which they frequently possess, and to their capacity for associationwith one another in great systems, they outstrip the tardy consecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us ontowards our ultimate termini in a far more labor-saving way than the following of trains of sensible perception evercould. Wonderful are the new cuts and the short-circuits the thought-paths make. Most thought-paths, it is true, aresubstitutes for nothing actual; they end outside the real world altogether, in wayward fancies, utopias, fictions ormistakes. But where they do re-enter reality and terminate therein, we substitute them always; and with thesesubstitutes we pass the greater number of our hours.2Whosoever feels his experience to be something substitutional even while he has it, may be said to have anexperience that reaches beyond itself. From inside of its own entity it says 'more,' and postulates reality existingelsewhere. For the transcendentalist, who holds knowing to consist in a salto mortale across an 'epistemologicalchasm,' such an idea presents no difficulty; but it seems at first sight as if it might be inconsistent with an empiricismlike our own. Have we not explained that conceptual knowledge is made such wholly by1Of which all that need be said in this essay is that it also can be conceived as functional, and defined in terms of transitions, or of thepossibility of such.2This is why I called our experiences, taken all together, a quasi-chaos. There is vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiencesthan we commonly suppose. The objective nucleus of every man's experience, his own body, is, it is true, a continuous percept; and equallycontinuous as a percept (though we may be inattentive to it) is the material environment of that body, changing by gradual transition whenthe body moves. But the distant parts of the physical world are at all times absent from us, and form conceptual objects merely, into theperceptual reality of which our life inserts itself at points discrete and relatively rare. Round their several objective nuclei, partly shared andcommon, partly discrete, of the real physical world, innumerable thinkers, pursuing their several lines of physically true cogitation, tracepaths that intersect one another only at discontinuous perceptual points, and the rest of the time are quite incongruent; and around all thenuclei of shared 'reality' floats the vast cloud of experiences that are wholly subjective, that are non-substitutional, that find not even aneventual ending for themselves in the perceptual world—the mere day-dreams and joys and sufferings and wishes of the individual minds.These exist with one another, indeed, and with the objective nuclei, but out of them it is probable that to all eternity no inter-related system ofany kind will ever be made."},{"pageNumber":938,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP887 hl[01 03 2011 16 06 02]Page 887the existence of things that fall outside of the knowing experience itself—by intermediary experiences and by aterminus that fulfils? Can the knowledge be there before these elements that constitute its being have come? And, ifknowledge be not there, how can objective reference occur?The key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing as verified and completed, and the same knowing asin transit and on its way. To recur to the Memorial Hall example lately used, it is only when our idea of the Hall hasactually terminated in the percept that we know 'for certain' that from the beginning it was truly cognitive of that.Until established by the end of the process, its quality of knowing that, or indeed of knowing anything, could still bedoubted; and yet the knowing really was there, as the result now shows. We were virtual knowers of the Hall longbefore we were certified to have been its actual knowers, by the percept's retroactive validating power. Just so we are'mortal' all the time, by reason of the virtuality of the inevitable event which will make us so when it shall have come.Now the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond this virtual stage. It never is completed ornailed down. I speak not merely of our ideas of imperceptibles like ether-waves or dissociated 'ions,' or of 'ejects' likethe contents of our neighbors' minds; I speak also of ideas which we might verify if we would take the trouble, butwhich we hold for true altho unterminated perceptually, because nothing says 'no' to us, and there is no contradictingtruth in sight. To continue thinking unchallenged is, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, our practical substitute forknowing in the completed sense. As each experience runs by cognitive transition into the next one, and we nowherefeel a collision with what we elsewhere count as truth or fact, we commit ourselves to the current as if the port weresure. We live, as it were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-crest, and our sense of a determinate direction infalling forward is all we cover of the future of our path. It is as if a differential quotient should be conscious and treatitself as an adequate substitute for a traced-out curve. Our experience, inter alia, is of variations of rate and ofdirection, and lives in these transitions more than in the journey's end. The experiences of tendency are suffi-"},{"pageNumber":939,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP888 hl[01 03 2011 16 07 09]Page 888cient to act upon—what more could we have done at those moments even if the later verification comes complete?This is what, as a radical empiricist, I say to the charge that the objective reference which is so flagrant a character ofour experiences involves a chasm and a mortal leap. A positively conjunctive transition involves neither chasm norleap. Being the very original of what we mean by continuity, it makes a continuum wherever it appears. Objectivereference is an incident of the fact that so much of our experience comes as an insufficient and consists of process andtransition. Our fields of experience have no more definite boundaries than have our fields of view. Both are fringedforever by a more that continuously develops, and that continuously supersedes them as life proceeds. The relations,generally speaking, are as real here as the terms are, and the only complaint of the transcendentalist's with which Icould at all sympathize would be his charge that, by first making knowledge to consist in external relations as I havedone, and by then confessing that ninetenths of the time these are not actually but only virtually there, I have knockedthe solid bottom out of the whole business, and palmed off a substitute of knowledge for the genuine thing. Only theadmission, such a critic might say, that our ideas are self-transcendent and 'true' already, in advance of the experiencesthat are to terminate them, can bring solidity back to knowledge in a world like this, in which transitions andterminations are only by exception fulfilled.This seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic method. What would the self-transcendency affirmedto exist in advance of all experiential mediation or termination, be known-as? What would it practically result in forus, were it true?It could only result in our orientation, in the turning of our expectations and practical tendencies into the right path;and the right path here, so long as we and the object are not yet face to face (or can never get face to face, as in thecase of ejects), would be the path that led us into the object's nearest neighborhood. Where direct acquaintance islacking, 'knowledge about' is the next best thing, and an acquaintance with what actually lies about the object, and ismost closely related to it, puts such knowledge within our grasp. Ether-waves and"},{"pageNumber":940,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP889 hl[01 03 2011 16 08 17]Page 889your anger, for example, are things in which my thoughts will never perceptually terminate, but my concepts of themlead me to their very brink, to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful words and deeds which are their really nexteffects.Even if our ideas did in themselves possess the postulated self-transcendency, it would still remain true that theirputting us into possession of such effects would be the sole cash-value of the self-transcendency for us. And thiscash-value, it is needless to say, is verbatim et literatim what our empiricist account pays in. On pragmatist principlestherefore, a dispute over self-transcendency is a pure logomachy. Call our concepts of ejective things self-transcendent or the reverse, it makes no difference, so long as we don't differ about the nature of that exalted virtue'sfruits—fruits for us, of course, humanistic fruits.The transcendentalist believes his ideas to be self-transcendent only because he finds that in fact they do bear fruits.Why need he quarrel with an account of knowledge that insists on naming this effect? Why not treat the working ofthe idea from next to next as the essence of its self-transcendency? Why insist that knowing is a static relation out oftime when it practically seems so much a function of our active life? For a thing to be valid, says Lotze, is the sameas to make itself valid. When the whole universe seems only to be making itself valid and to be still incomplete (elsewhy its ceaseless changing?) why, of all things, should knowing be exempt? Why should it not be making itself validlike everything else? That some parts of it may be already valid or verified beyond dispute, the empirical philosopher,of course, like any one else, may always hope."},{"pageNumber":941,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP890 hl[01 03 2011 16 09 24]Page 890VThe Essence of Humanism1Humasism is a ferment that has 'come to stay.' It is not a single hypothesis or theorem, and it dwells on no new facts.It is rather a slow shifting in the philosophic perspective, making things appear as from a new centre of interest orpoint of sight. Some writers are strongly conscious of the shifting, others half unconscious, even though their ownvision may have undergone much change. The result is no small confusion in debate, the half-conscious humanistsoften taking part against the radical ones, as if they wished to count upon the other side.2If humanism really be the name for such a shifting of perspective, it is obvious that the whole scene of the philosophicstage will change in some degree if humanism prevails. The emphasis of things, their foreground and backgrounddistribution, their sizes and values, will not keep just the same.3 If such pervasive consequences be involved inhumanism, it is clear that no pains which philosophers may take, first in defining it, and then in furthering, checking,or steering its progress, will be thrown away.It suffers badly at present from incomplete definition. Its most systematic advocates, Schiller and Dewey, have pub-1Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods, vol. ii, No. 5, March 2, 1905.2Professor Baldwin, for example. His address 'Selective Thinking' (Psychological Review, January, 1898, reprinted in his volume,'Development and Evolution') seems to me an unusually well written pragmatic manifesto. Nevertheless in 'The Limits of Pragmatism' (ibid.,January, 1904), he (much less clearly) joins in the attack.3The ethical changes, it seems to me, are beautifully made evident in Professor Dewey's series of articles, which will never get the attentionthey deserve till they are printed in a book. I mean: 'The Significance of Emotions,' Psychological Review, vol. ii, 13; 'The Reflex ArcConcept in Psychology,' ibid., iii, 357; 'Psychology and Social Practice,' ibid., vii, 105; 'Interpretation of Savage Mind,' ibid., ix, 217;'Green's Theory of the Moral Motive,' Philosophical Review, vol. i, 593; 'Self-realization as the Moral Ideal,' ibid., ii, 652; 'The Psychology ofEffort,' ibid., vi, 43; 'The Evolutionary Method as Applied to Morality,' ibid., xi, 107, 353; 'Evolution and Ethics,' Monist, vol. viii, 321; tomention only a few."},{"pageNumber":942,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP891 hl[01 03 2011 16 10 31]Page 891lished fragmentary programmes only; and its bearing on many vital philosophic problems has not been traced exceptby adversaries who, scenting heresies in advance, have showered blows on doctrines—subjectivism and scepticism,for example—that no good humanist finds it necessary to entertain. By their still greater reticences, the anti-humanistshave, in turn, perplexed the humanists. Much of the controversy has involved the word 'truth.' It is always good indebate to know your adversary's point of view authentically. But the critics of humanism never define exactly whatthe word 'truth' signifies when they use it themselves. The humanists have to guess at their view; and the result hasdoubtless been much beating of the air. Add to all this, great individual differences in both camps, and it becomesclear that nothing is so urgently needed, at the stage which things have reached at present, as a sharper definition byeach side of its central point of view.Whoever will contribute any touch of sharpness will help us to make sure of what's what and who is who. Any onecan contribute such a definition, and, without it, no one knows exactly where he stands. If I offer my own provisionaldefinition of humanism now and here, others may improve it, some adversary may be led to define his own creedmore sharply by the contrast, and a certain quickening of the crystallization of general opinion may result.IThe essential service of humanism, as I conceive the situation, is to have seen that tho one part of our experience maylean upon another part to make it what it is in any one of several aspects in which it may be considered, experienceas a whole is self-containing and leans on nothing. Since this formula also expresses the main contention oftranscendental idealism, it needs abundant explication to make it unambiguous. It seems, at first sight, to confine itselfto denying theism and pantheism. But, in fact, it need not deny either; everything would depend on the exegesis; andif the formula ever became canonical, it would certainly develop both right-wing and left-wing interpreters. I myselfread humanism theistically and pluralistically. If there be a God, he is no absolute all-"},{"pageNumber":943,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP892 hl[01 03 2011 16 11 38]Page 892experiencer, but simply the experiencer of widest actual conscious span. Read thus, humanism is for me a religionsusceptible of reasoned defence, tho I am well aware how many minds there are to whom it can appeal religiouslyonly when it has been monistically translated. Ethically the pluralistic form of it takes for me a stronger hold on realitythan any other philosophy I know of—it being essentially a social philosophy, a philosophy of 'co,' in whichconjunctions do the work. But my primary reason for advocating it is its matchless intellectual economy. It gets rid,not only of the standing 'problems' that monism engenders ('problem of evil,' 'problem of freedom,' and the like), butof other metaphysical mysteries and paradoxes as well.It gets rid, for example, of the whole agnostic controversy, by refusing to entertain the hypothesis of trans-empiricalreality at all. It gets rid of any need for an absolute of the bradleyan type (avowedly sterile for intellectual purposes)by insisting that the conjunctive relations found within experience are faultlessly real. It gets rid of the need of anabsolute of the roycean type (similarly sterile) by its pragmatic treatment of the problem of knowledge. As the viewsof knowledge, reality and truth imputed to humanism have been those so far most fiercely attacked, it is in regard tothese ideas that a sharpening of focus seems most urgently required. I proceed therefore to bring the views which Iimpute to humanism in these respects into focus as briefly as I can.IIIf the central humanistic thesis, printed above in italics, be accepted, it will follow that, if there be any such thing at allas knowing, the knower and the object known must both be portions of experience. One part of experience must,therefore, either(1) Know another part of experience—in other words, parts must, as Professor Woodbridge says,1 represent oneanother instead of representing realities outside of 'consciousness'—this case is that of conceptual knowledge; or else1In Science, November 4, 1904, p. 599."},{"pageNumber":944,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP893 hl[01 03 2011 16 12 46]Page 893(2) They must simply exist as so many ultimate thats or facts of being, in the first instance; and then, as a secondarycomplication, and without doubling up its entitative singleness, any one and the same that in experience must figurealternately as a thing known and as a knowledge of the thing, by reason of two divergent kinds of context into which,in the general course of experience, it gets woven.1This second case is that of sense-perception. There is a stage of thought that goes beyond common sense, and of it Ishall say more presently; but the common-sense stage is a perfectly definite halting-place of thought, primarily forpurposes of action; and, so long as we remain on the common-sense stage of thought, object and subject fuse in thefact of 'presentation' or sense-perception—the pen and hand which I now see writing, for example, are the physicalrealities which those words designate. In this case there is no self-transcendency implied in the knowing. Humanism,here, is only a more comminuted identitätsphilosophie.In case (1), on the contrary, the representative experience does transcend itself in knowing the other experience that isits object. No one can talk of the knowledge of the one by the other without seeing them as numerically distinctentities, of which the one lies beyond the other and away from it, along some direction and with some interval, thatcan be definitely named. But, if the talker be a humanist, he must also see this distance-interval concretely andpragmatically, and confess it to consist of other intervening experiences—of possible ones, at all events, if not ofactual. To call my present idea of my dog, for example, cognitive of the real dog means that, as the actual tissue ofexperience is constituted, the idea is capable of leading into a chain of other experiences on my part that go from nextto next and terminate at last in vivid sense-perceptions of a jumping, barking, hairy body. Those are the real dog, thedog's full presence, for my common sense. If the supposed talker is a profound philosopher, altho they may not be thereal dog for him, they mean the real dog, are practical substitutes for the real dog, as the representation was a1This statement is probably excessively obscure to any one who has not read my two articles 'Does Consciousness Exist?' and 'A Worldof Pure Experience' in the Journal of Philosophy, vol. i, 1904."},{"pageNumber":945,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP894 hl[01 03 2011 16 13 56]Page 894practical substitute for them, that real dog being a lot of atoms, say, or of mind-stuff, that lie where the sense-perceptions lie in his experience as well as in my own.IIIThe philosopher here stands for the stage of thought that goes beyond the stage of common sense; and the difference issimply that he 'interpolates' and 'extrapolates,' where common sense does not. For common sense, two men see thesame identical real dog. Philosophy, noting actual differences in their perceptions, points out the duality of these latter,and interpolates something between them as a more real terminus—first, organs, viscera, etc.; next, cells; then,ultimate atoms; lastly, mind-stuff perhaps. The original sense-termini of the two men, instead of coalescing with eachother and with the real dog-object, as at first supposed, are thus held by philosophers to be separated by invisiblerealities with which, at most, they are conterminous.Abolish, now, one of the percipients, and the interpolation changes into 'extrapolation.' The sense-terminus of theremaining percipient is regarded by the philosopher as not quite reaching reality. He has only carried the procession ofexperiences, the philosopher thinks, to a definite, because practical, halting-place somewhere on the way towards anabsolute truth that lies beyond.The humanist sees all the time, however, that there is no absolute transcendency even about the more absolute realitiesthus conjectured or believed in. The viscera and cells are only possible percepts following upon that of the outer body.The atoms again, tho we may never attain to human means of perceiving them, are still defined perceptually. Themind-stuff itself is conceived as a kind of experience; and it is possible to frame the hypothesis (such hypotheses canby no logic be excluded from philosophy) of two knowers of a piece of mind-stuff and the mind-stuff itself becoming'confluent' at the moment at which our imperfect knowing might pass into knowing of a completed type. Even so doyou and I habitually conceive our two perceptions and the real dog as confluent, tho only provisionally, and for thecommon-sense stage of thought. If my pen be inwardly made of mind-stuff,"},{"pageNumber":946,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP895 hl[01 03 2011 16 15 37]Page 895there is no confluence now between that mind-stuff and my visual perception of the pen. But conceivably there mightcome to be such confluence; for, in the case of my hand, the visual sensations and the inward feelings of the hand, itsmind-stuff, so to speak, are even now as confluent as any two things can be.There is, thus, no breach in humanistic epistemology. Whether knowledge be taken as ideally perfected, or only astrue enough to pass muster for practice, it is hung on one continuous scheme. Reality, howsoever remote, is alwaysdefined as a terminus within the general possibilities of experience; and what knows it is defined as an experience that'represents' it, in the sense of being substitutable for it in our thinking because it leads to the same associates, or in thesense of 'pointing to it' through a chain of other experiences that either intervene or may intervene.Absolute reality here bears the same relation to sensation as sensation bears to conception or imagination. Both areprovisional or final termini, sensation being only the terminus at which the practical man habitually stops, while thephilosopher projects a 'beyond,' in the shape of more absolute reality. These termini, for the practical and thephilosophical stages of thought respectively, are self-supporting. They are not 'true' of anything else, they simply are,are real. They 'lean on nothing,' as my italicized formula said. Rather does the whole fabric of experience lean onthem, just as the whole fabric of the solar system, including many relative positions, leans, for its absolute position inspace, on any one of its constituent stars. Here, again, one gets a new Identitätsphilosophie in pluralistic form.IVIf I have succeeded in making this at all clear (tho I fear that brevity and abstractness between them may have mademe fail), the reader will see that the 'truth' of our mental operations must always be an intra-experiential affair. Aconception is reckoned true by common sense when it can be made to lead to a sensation. The sensation, which forcommon sense is not so much 'true' as 'real,' is held to be provisionally true by the philosopher just in so far as itcovers (abuts at, or"},{"pageNumber":947,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP896 hl[01 03 2011 16 16 45]Page 896occupies the place of) a still more absolutely real experience, in the possibility of which, to some remoter experient,the philosopher finds reason to believe.Meanwhile what actually does count for true to any individual trower, whether he be philosopher or common man, isalways a result of his apperceptions. If a novel experience, conceptual or sensible, contradict too emphatically ourpre-existent system of beliefs, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it is treated as false. Only when the older and thenewer experiences are congruous enough to mutually apperceive and modify each other, does what we treat as anadvance in truth result. In no case, however, need truth consist in a relation between our experiences and somethingarchetypal or trans-experiential. Should we ever reach absolutely terminal experiences, experiences in which we allagreed, which were superseded by no revised continuations, these would not be true, they would be real, they wouldsimply be, and be indeed the angles, corners, and linchpins of all reality, on which the truth of everything else wouldbe stayed. Only such other things as led to these by satisfactory conjunctions would be 'true.' Satisfactory connectionof some sort with such termini is all that the word 'truth' means. On the common-sense stage of thought sense-presentations serve as such termini. Our ideas and concepts and scientific theories pass for true only so far as theyharmoniously lead back to the world of sense.I hope that many humanists will endorse this attempt of mine to trace the more essential features of that way ofviewing things. I feel almost certain that Messrs. Dewey and Schiller will do so. If the attackers will also take someslight account of it, it may be that discussion will be a little less wide of the mark than it has hitherto been."},{"pageNumber":948,"pageContent":" Page 897VIA Word More about Truth1My failure in making converts to my conception of truth seems, if I may judge by what I hear in conversation, almostcomplete. An ordinary philosopher would feel disheartened, and a common choleric sinner would curse God and die,after such a reception. But instead of taking counsel of despair, I make bold to vary my statements, in the faint hopethat repeated droppings may wear upon the stone, and that my formulas may seem less obscure if surrounded bysomething more of a 'mass' whereby to apperceive them.For fear of compromising other pragmatists, whoe'er they be, I will speak of the conception which I am trying tomake intelligible, as my own conception. I first published it in the year 1885, in the first article reprinted in the presentbook. Essential theses of this article were independently supported in 1893 and 1895 by Professor D. S. Miller2 andwere repeated by me in a presidential address on 'The knowing of things together'3 in 1895. Professor Strong, in anarticle in the Journal of Philosophy, etc.,4 entitled 'A naturalistic theory of the reference of thought to reality,' calledour account 'the James-Miller theory of cognition,' and, as I understood him, gave it his adhesion. Yet, such is thedifficulty of writing clearly in these penetralia of philosophy, that each of these revered colleagues informs meprivately that the account of truth I now give—which to me is but that earlier statement more completely set forth—isto him inadequate, and seems to leave the gist of real cognition out. If such near friends disagree, what can I hopefrom remoter ones, and what from unfriendly critics?Yet I feel so sure that the fault must lie in my lame forms of statement and not in my doctrine, that I am fain to tryonce more to express myself.1Reprint from the Journal of Philosophy, July 18, 1907.2Philosophical Review, vol. ii, p. 408, and Psychological Review, vol. ii, p. 533.3The relevant parts of which are printed above, p. 853.4Vol. i, p. 253."},{"pageNumber":949,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP898 hl[01 03 2011 16 17 53]Page 898IAre there not some general distinctions which it may help us to agree about in advance? Professor Strongdistinguishes between what he calls 'saltatory' and what he calls 'ambulatory' relations. 'Difference,' for example, issaltatory, jumping as it were immediately from one term to another, but 'distance' in time or space is made out ofintervening parts of experience through which we ambulate in succession. Years ago, when T. H. Green's ideas weremost influential, I was much troubled by his criticisms of english sensationalism. One of his disciples in particularwould always say to me, 'Yes! terms may indeed be possibly sensational in origin; but relations, what are they butpure acts of the intellect coming upon the sensations from above, and of a higher nature?' I well remember the suddenrelief it gave me to perceive one day that space-relations at any rate were homogeneous with the terms between whichthey mediated. The terms were spaces, and the relations were other intervening spaces.1 For the Greenites space-relations had been saltatory, for me they became thenceforward ambulatory.Now the most general way of contrasting my view of knowledge with the popular view (which is also the view ofmost epistemologists) is to call my view ambulatory, and the other view saltatory; and the most general way ofcharacterizing the two views is by saying that my view describes knowing as it exists concretely, while the other viewonly describes its results abstractly taken.I fear that most of my recalcitrant readers fail to recognize that what is ambulatory in the concrete may be taken soabstractly as to appear saltatory. Distance, for example, is made abstract by emptying out whatever is particular in theconcrete intervals—it is reduced thus to a sole 'difference,' a difference of 'place,' which is a logical or saltatorydistinction, a so-called 'pure relation.'The same is true of the relation called 'knowing,' which may connect an idea with a reality. My own account of thisrelation is ambulatory through and through. I say that we know an object by means of an idea, whenever we ambulate1See my Principles of Psychology, vol. ii, pp. 148 153."},{"pageNumber":950,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP899 hl[01 03 2011 16 19 00]Page 899towards the object under the impulse which the idea communicates. If we believe in so-called 'sensible' realities, theidea may not only send us towards its object, but may put the latter into our very hand, make it our immediatesensation. But, if, as most reflective people opine, sensible realities are not 'real' realities, but only their appearances,our idea brings us at least so far, puts us in touch with reality's most authentic appearances and substitutes. In any caseour idea brings us into the object's neighborhood, practical or ideal, gets us into commerce with it, helps us towards itscloser acquaintance, enables us to foresee it, class it, compare it, deduce it,—in short, to deal with it as we could notwere the idea not in our possession.The idea is thus, when functionally considered, an instrument for enabling us the better to have to do with the objectand to act about it. But it and the object are both of them bits of the general sheet and tissue of reality at large; andwhen we say that the idea leads us towards the object, that only means that it carries us forward through interveningtracts of that reality into the object's closer neighborhood, into the midst of its associates at least, be these its physicalneighbors, or be they its logical congeners only. Thus carried into closer quarters, we are in an improved situation asregards acquaintance and conduct; and we say that through the idea we now know the object better or more truly.My thesis is that the knowing here is made by the ambulation through the intervening experiences. If the idea led usnowhere, or from that object instead of towards it, could we talk at all of its having any cognitive quality? Surely not,for it is only when taken in conjunction with the intermediate experiences that it gets related to that particular objectrather than to any other part of nature. Those intermediaries determine what particular knowing function it exerts. Theterminus they guide us to tells us what object it 'means,' the results they enrich us with 'verify' or 'refute' it. Interveningexperiences are thus as indispensable foundations for a concrete relation of cognition as intervening space is for arelation of distance. Cognition, whenever we take it concretely, means determinate 'ambulation,' throughintermediaries, from a terminus a quo to, or towards, a terminus ad quem."},{"pageNumber":951,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP900 hl[01 03 2011 16 20 07]Page 900As the intermediaries are other than the termini, and connected with them by the usual associative bonds (be these'external' or be they logical, i. e., classificatory, in character), there would appear to be nothing especially unique aboutthe processes of knowing. They fall wholly within experience; and we need use, in describing them, no othercategories than those which we employ in describing other natural processes.But there exist no processes which we cannot also consider abstractly, eviscerating them down to their essentialskeletons or outlines; and when we have treated the processes of knowing thus, we are easily led to regard them assomething altogether unparalleled in nature. For we first empty idea, object and intermediaries of all theirparticularities, in order to retain only a general scheme, and then we consider the latter only in its function of giving aresult, and not in its character of being a process. In this treatment the intermediaries shrivel into the form of a merespace of separation, while the idea and object retain only the logical distinctness of being the end-terms that areseparated. In other words, the intermediaries which in their concrete particularity form a bridge, evaporate ideally intoan empty interval to cross, and then, the relation of the end-terms having become saltatory, the whole hocus-pocus oferkenntnisstheorie begins, and goes on unrestrained by further concrete considerations. The idea, in 'meaning' anobject separated by an 'epistemological chasm' from itself, now executes what Professor Ladd calls a 'salto mortale';in knowing the object's nature, it now 'transcends' its own. The object in turn becomes 'present' where it is reallyabsent, etc.; until a scheme remains upon our hands, the sublime paradoxes of which some of us think that nothingshort of an 'absolute' can explain.The relation between idea and object, thus made abstract and saltatory, is thenceforward opposed, as being moreessential and previous, to its own ambulatory self, and the more concrete description is branded as either false orinsufficient. The bridge of intermediaries, actual or possible, which in every real case is what carries and defines theknowing, gets treated as an episodic complication which need not even potentially be there. I believe that this vulgarfallacy of opposing"},{"pageNumber":952,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP901 hl[01 03 2011 16 21 15]Page 901abstractions to the concretes from which they are abstracted, is the main reason why my account of knowing isdeemed so unsatisfactory, and I will therefore say a word more on that general point.Any vehicle of conjunction, if all its particularities are abstracted from it, will leave us with nothing on our hands butthe original disjunction which it bridged over. But to escape treating the resultant self-contradiction as an achievementof dialectical profundity, all we need is to restore some part, no matter how small, of what we have taken away. In thecase of the epistemological chasm the first reasonable step is to remember that the chasm was filled with someempirical material, whether ideational or sensational, which performed some bridging function and saved us from themortal leap. Restoring thus the indispensable modicum of reality to the matter of our discussion, we find our abstracttreatment genuinely useful. We escape entanglement with special cases without at the same time falling into gratuitousparadoxes. We can now describe the general features of cognition, tell what on the whole it does for us, in a universalway.We must remember that this whole inquiry into knowing grows up on a reflective level. In any real moment ofknowing, what we are thinking of is our object, not the way in which we ourselves are momentarily knowing it. We atthis moment, as it happens, have knowing itself for our object; but I think that the reader will agree that his presentknowing of that object is included only abstractly, and by anticipation, in the results he may reach. What he concretelyhas before his mind, as he reasons, is some supposed objective instance of knowing, as he conceives it to go on insome other person, or recalls it from his own past. As such, he, the critic, sees it to contain both an idea and an object,and processes by which the knower is guided from the one towards the other. He sees that the idea is remote from theobject, and that, whether through intermediaries or not, it genuinely has to do with it. He sees that it thus worksbeyond its immediate being, and lays hold of a remote reality; it jumps across, transcends itself. It does all this byextraneous aid, to be sure, but when the aid has come, it has done it and the result is secure. Why not talk of results bythemselves, then, without considering"},{"pageNumber":953,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP902 hl[01 03 2011 16 22 22]Page 902means? Why not treat the idea as simply grasping or intuiting the reality, of its having the faculty anyhow, ofshooting over nature behind the scenes and knowing things immediately and directly? Why need we always lug in thebridging?—it only retards our discourse to do so.Such abstract talk about cognition's results is surely convenient; and it is surely as legitimate as it is convenient, solong as we do not forget or positively deny, what it ignores. We may on occasion say that our idea meant always thatparticular object, that it led us there because it was of it intrinsically and essentially. We may insist that its verificationfollows upon that original cognitive virtue in it—and all the rest—and we shall do no harm so long as we know thatthese are only short cuts in our thinking. They are positively true accounts of fact as far as they go, only they leavevast tracts of fact out of the account, tracts of fact that have to be reinstated to make the accounts literally true of anyreal case. But if, not merely passively ignoring the intermediaries, you actively deny them1 to be even potentialrequisites for the results you are so struck by, your epistemology goes to irremediable smash. You are as far off thetrack as an historian would be, if, lost in admiration of Napoleon's personal power, he were to ignore his marshals andhis armies, and were to accuse you of error in describing his conquests as effected by their means. Of suchabstractness and one-sidedness I accuse most of the critics of my own account.In the second lecture of the book Pragmatism, I used the illustration of a squirrel scrambling round a tree-trunk tokeep out of sight of a pursuing man: both go round the tree, but does the man go round the squirrel? It all depends, Isaid, on what you mean by 'going round.' In one sense of the word the man 'goes round,' in another sense he does not.I settled the dispute by pragmatically distinguishing the senses. But I told how some disputants had called mydistinction a shuffling evasion and taken their stand on what they called 'plain honest English going-round.'In such a simple case few people would object to letting the term in dispute be translated into its concreter equiva-1This is the fallacy which I have called 'vicious intellectualism' in my book A Pluralistic Universe, Longmans, Green & Co., 1909."},{"pageNumber":954,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP903 hl[01 03 2011 16 23 29]Page 903lents. But in the case of a complex function like our knowing they act differently. I give full concrete particular valuefor the ideas of knowing in every case I can think of, yet my critics insist that 'plain honest English knowing' is left outof my account. They write as if the minus were on my side and the plus on theirs.The essence of the matter for me is that altho knowing can be both abstractly and concretely described, and altho theabstract descriptions are often useful enough, yet they are all sucked up and absorbed without residuum into theconcreter ones, and contain nothing of any essentially other or higher nature, which the concrete descriptions can bejustly accused of leaving behind. Knowing is just a natural process like any other. There is no ambulatory processwhatsoever, the results of which we may not describe, if we prefer to, in saltatory terms, or represent in staticformulation. Suppose, e. g., that we say a man is 'prudent.' Concretely, that means that he takes out insurance, hedgesin betting, looks before he leaps. Do such acts constitute the prudence? are they the man quâ prudent? Or is theprudence something by itself and independent of them? As a constant habit in him, a permanent tone of character, it isconvenient to call him prudent in abstraction from any one of his acts, prudent in general and without specification,and to say the acts follow from the pre-existing prudence. There are peculiarities in his psycho-physical system thatmake him act prudently; and there are tendencies to association in our thoughts that prompt some of them to make fortruth and others for error. But would the man be prudent in the absence of each and all of the acts? Or would thethoughts be true if they had no associative or impulsive tendencies? Surely we have no right to oppose static essencesin this way to the moving processes in which they live embedded.My bedroom is above my library. Does the 'aboveness' here mean aught that is different from the concrete spaceswhich have to be moved-through in getting from the one to the other? It means, you may say, a pure topographicrelation, a sort of architect's plan among the eternal essences. But that is not the full aboveness, it is only anabbreviated substitute that on occasion may lead my mind towards truer,"},{"pageNumber":955,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP904 hl[01 03 2011 16 24 37]Page 904i. e., fuller, dealings with the real aboveness. It is not an aboveness ante rem, it is a post rem extract from theaboveness in rebus. We may indeed talk, for certain conveniences, as if the abstract scheme preceded, we may say 'Imust go up stairs because of the essential aboveness,' just as we may say that the man 'does prudent acts because ofhis ingrained prudence,' or that our ideas 'lead us truly because of their intrinsic truth.' But this should not debar us onother occasions from using completer forms of description. A concrete matter of fact always remains identical underany form of description, as when we say of a line, now that it runs from left to right, and now that it runs from rightto left. These are but names of one and the same fact, one more expedient to use at one time, one at another. The fullfacts of cognition, whatever be the way in which we talk about them, even when we talk most abstractly, standinalterably given in the actualities and possibilities of the experience-continuum.1 But my critics treat my own moreconcrete talk as if it were the kind that sinned by its inadequacy, and as if the full continuum left something out.A favorite way of opposing the more abstract to the more concrete account is to accuse those who favor the latter of'confounding psychology with logic.' Our critics say that when we are asked what truth means, we reply by tellingonly how it is arrived-at. But since a meaning is a logical relation, static, independent of time, how can it possibly beidentified, they say, with any concrete man's experience, perishing as this does at the instant of its production? This,indeed, sounds profound, but I challenge the profundity. I defy any one to show any difference between logic andpsychology here. The logical relation stands to the psychological relation between idea and object only as saltatoryabstractness stands to ambulatory concreteness. Both relations need a psychological vehicle; and the 'logical' one issimply the 'psychological' one disemboweled of its fulness, and reduced to a bare abstractional scheme.1The ultimate object or terminus of a cognitive process may in certain instances lie beyond the direct experience of the particularcognizer, but it, of course, must exist as part of the total universe of experience whose constitution, with cognition in it, the critic isdiscussing."},{"pageNumber":956,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP905 hl[01 03 2011 16 25 44]Page 905A while ago a prisoner, on being released, tried to assassinate the judge who had sentenced him. He had apparentlysucceeded in conceiving the judge timelessly, had reduced him to a bare logical meaning, that of being his 'enemy andpersecutor,' by stripping off all the concrete conditions (as jury's verdict, official obligation, absence of personal spite,possibly sympathy) that gave its full psychological character to the sentence as a particular man's act in time. Trulythe sentence was inimical to the culprit; but which idea of it is the truer one, that bare logical definition of it, or itsfull psychological specification? The anti-pragmatists ought in consistency to stand up for the criminal's view of thecase, treat the judge as the latter's logical enemy, and bar out the other conditions as so much inessential psychologicalstuff.IIA still further obstacle, I suspect, stands in the way of my account's acceptance. Like Dewey and like Schiller, I havehad to say that the truth of an idea is determined by its satisfactoriness. But satisfactoriness is a subjective term, justas idea is; and truth is generally regarded as 'objective.' Readers who admit that satisfactoriness is our only mark oftruth, the only sign that we possess the precious article, will still say that the objective relation between idea andobject which the word 'truth' points to is left out of my account altogether. I fear also that the association of my poorname with the 'will to believe' (which 'will,' it seems to me, ought to play no part in this discussion) works against mycredit in some quarters. I fornicate with that unclean thing, my adversaries may think, whereas your genuine truth-lover must discourse in huxleyan heroics, and feel as if truth, to be real truth, ought to bring eventual messages ofdeath to all our satisfactions. Such divergences certainly prove the complexity of the area of our discussion; but to mymind they also are based on misunderstandings, which (tho with but little hope of success) I will try to diminish by afurther word of explanation.First, then, I will ask my objectors to define exactly what sort of thing it is they have in mind when they speak of atruth that shall be absolute, complete and objective; and then I will defy them to show me any conceivable standing-room"},{"pageNumber":957,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP906 hl[01 03 2011 16 26 51]Page 906for such a kind of truth outside the terms of my own description. It will fall, as I contend, entirely within the field ofmy analysis.To begin with, it must obtain between an idea and a reality that is the idea's object; and, as a predicate, it must applyto the idea and not to the object, for objective realities are not true, at least not in the universe of discourse to whichwe are now confining ourselves, for there they are taken as simply being, while the ideas are true of them. But we cansuppose a series of ideas to be successively more and more true of the same object, and can ask what is the extremeapproach to being absolutely true that the last idea might attain to.The maximal conceivable truth in an idea would seem to be that it should lead to an actual merging of ourselves withthe object, to an utter mutual confluence and identification. On the common-sense level of belief this is what issupposed really to take place in sense-perception. My idea of this pen verifies itself through my percept; and mypercept is held to be the pen for the time being—percepts and physical realities being treated by common sense asidentical. But the physiology of the senses has criticised common sense out of court, and the pen 'in itself' is nowbelieved to lie beyond my momentary percept. Yet the notion once suggested, of what a completely consummatedacquaintance with a reality might be like, remains over for our speculative purposes. Total conflux of the mind with thereality would be the absolute limit of truth, there could be no better or more satisfying knowledge than that.Such total conflux, it is needless to say, is already explicitly provided for, as a possibility, in my account of the matter.If an idea should ever lead us not only towards, or up to, or against, a reality, but so close that we and the realityshould melt together, it would be made absolutely true, according to me, by that performance.In point of fact philosophers doubt that this ever occurs. What happens, they think, is only that we get nearer andnearer to realities, we approximate more and more to the all-satisfying limit; and the definition of actually, asdistinguished from imaginably, complete and objective truth, can then only be that it belongs to the idea that will leadus as close up"},{"pageNumber":958,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP907 hl[01 03 2011 16 27 58]Page 907against the object as in the nature of our experience is possible, literally next to it, for instance.Suppose, now, there were an idea that did this for a certain objective reality. Suppose that no further approach werepossible, that nothing lay between, that the next step would carry us right into the reality; then that result, being thenext thing to conflux, would make the idea true in the maximal degree that might be supposed practically attainable inthe world which we inhabit.Well, I need hardly explain that that degree of truth is also provided for in my account of the matter. And ifsatisfactions are the marks of truth's presence, we may add that any less true substitute for such a true idea wouldprove less satisfactory. Following its lead, we should probably find out that we did not quite touch the terminus. Weshould desiderate a closer approach, and not rest till we had found it.I am, of course, postulating here a standing reality independent of the idea that knows it. I am also postulating thatsatisfactions grow pari passu with our approximation to such reality.1 If my critics challenge this latter assumption, Iretort upon them with the former. Our whole notion of a standing reality grows up in the form of an ideal limit to theseries of successive termini to which our thoughts have led us and still are leading us. Each terminus provesprovisional by leaving us unsatisfied. The truer idea is the one that pushes farther; so we are ever beckoned on by theideal notion of an ultimate completely satisfactory terminus. I, for one, obey and accept that notion. I can conceive noother objective content to the notion of ideally perfect truth than that of penetration into such a terminus, nor can Iconceive that the notion would ever have grown up, or that true ideas would ever have been sorted out from false oridle ones, save for the greater sum of satisfactions, intellectual or practical, which the truer ones brought with them.Can we imagine a man absolutely satisfied with an idea and with all its relations to his other ideas and to his sensibleexperiences, who should yet not take its1Say, if you prefer to, that dissatisfactions decrease pari passu with such approximation.

The matter of the true is thus absolutely identical with the matter of thesatisfactory. You may put either word first in your ways of talking; but leave out that whole notion of satisfactoryworking or leading (which is the essence of my pragmatistic account) and call truth a static logical relation,independent even of possible leadings or satisfactions, and it seems to me you cut all ground from under you.I fear that I am still very obscure. But I respectfully implore those who reject my doctrine because they can makenothing of my stumbling language, to tell us in their own name—und zwar very concretely and articulately!—justhow the real, genuine and absolutely 'objective' truth which they believe in so profoundly, is constituted andestablished. They must n't point to the 'reality' itself, for truth is only our subjective relation to realities. What is thenominal essence of this relation, its logical definition, whether or not it be 'objectively' attainable by mortals?Whatever they may say it is, I have the firmest faith that my account will prove to have allowed for it and included itby anticipation, as one possible case in the total mixture of cases. There is, in short, no room for any grade or sort oftruth outside of the framework of the pragmatic system, outside of that jungle of empirical workings and leadings, andtheir nearer or ulterior terminations, of which I seem to have written so unskilfully."},{"pageNumber":960,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP909 hl[01 03 2011 16 30 13]Page 909VIIProfessor Pratt on TruthI1Professor J. B. Pratt's paper in the Journal of Philosophy for June 6, 1907, is so brilliantly written that itsmisconception of the pragmatist position seems doubly to call for a reply.He asserts that, for a pragmatist, truth cannot be a relation between an idea and a reality outside and transcendent ofthe idea, but must lie 'altogether within experience,' where it will need 'no reference to anything else to justify it'—noreference to the object, apparently. The pragmatist must 'reduce everything to psychology,' aye, and to the psychologyof the immediate moment. He is consequently debarred from saying that an idea that eventually gets psychologicallyverified was already true before the process of verifying was complete; and he is equally debarred from treating anidea as true provisionally so long as he only believes that he can verify it whenever he will.Whether such a pragmatist as this exists, I know not, never having myself met with the beast. We can define terms aswe like; and if that be my friend Pratt's definition of a pragmatist, I can only concur with his anti-pragmatism. But, insetting up the weird type, he quotes words from me; so, in order to escape being classed by some reader along with soasinine a being, I will reassert my own view of truth once more.Truth is essentially a relation between two things, an idea, on the one hand, and a reality outside of the idea, on theother. This relation, like all relations, has its fundamentum, namely, the matrix of experiential circumstance,psychological as well as physical, in which the correlated terms are found embedded. In the case of the relationbetween 'heir' and 'legacy' the fundamentum is a world in which there was a testator, and in which there is now a willand an executor; in the1Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, etc., August 15, 1907 (vol. iv, p. 464)."},{"pageNumber":961,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP910 hl[01 03 2011 16 31 20]Page 910case of that between idea and object, it is a world with circumstances of a sort to make a satisfactory verificationprocess, lying around and between the two terms. But just as a man may be called an heir and treated as one beforethe executor has divided the estate, so an idea may practically be credited with truth before the verification processhas been exhaustively carried out—the existence of the mass of verifying circumstance is enough. Where potentiallycounts for actuality in so many other cases, one does not see why it may not so count here. We call a man benevolentnot only for his kind acts paid in, but for his readiness to perform others; we treat an idea as 'luminous' not only forthe light it has shed, but for that we expect it will shed on dark problems. Why should we not equally trust the truth ofour ideas? We live on credits everywhere; and we use our ideas far oftener for calling up things connected with theirimmediate objects, than for calling up those objects themselves. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the only use weshould make of the object itself, if we were led up to it by our idea, would be to pass on to those connected things byits means. So we continually curtail verification-processes, letting our belief that they are possible suffice.What constitutes the relation known as truth, I now say, is just the existence in the empirical world of thisfundamentum of circumstance surrounding object and idea and ready to be either short-circuited or traversed at fulllength. So long as it exists, and a satisfactory passage through it between the object and the idea is possible, that ideawill both be true, and will have been true of that object, whether fully developed verification has taken place or not.The nature and place and affinities of the object of course play as vital a part in making the particular passage possibleas do the nature and associative tendencies of the idea; so that the notion that truth could fall altogether inside of thethinker's private experience and be something purely psychological, is absurd. It is between the idea and the objectthat the truth-relation is to be sought and it involves both terms.But the 'intellectualistic' position, if I understand Mr. Pratt rightly, is that, altho we can use this fundamentum, thismass of go-between experience, for testing truth, yet the truth-"},{"pageNumber":962,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP911 hl[01 03 2011 16 32 27]Page 911relation in itself remains as something apart. It means, in Mr. Pratt's words, merely 'this simple thing that the object ofwhich one is thinking is as one thinks it.'It seems to me that the word 'as,' which qualifies the relation here, and bears the whole 'epistemological' burden, isanything but simple. What it most immediately suggests is that the idea should be like the object; but most of ourideas, being abstract concepts, bear almost no resemblance to their objects. The 'as' must therefore, I should say, beusually interpreted functionally, as meaning that the idea shall lead us into the same quarters of experience as theobject would. Experience leads ever on and on, and objects and our ideas of objects may both lead to the same goals.The ideas being in that case shorter cuts, we substitute them more and more for their objects; and we habitually waivedirect verification of each one of them, as their train passes through our mind, because if an idea leads as the objectwould lead, we can say, in Mr. Pratt's words, that in so far forth the object is as we think it, and that the idea, verifiedthus in so far forth, is true enough.Mr. Pratt will undoubtedly accept most of these facts, but he will deny that they spell pragmatism. Of course,definitions are free to every one; but I have myself never meant by the pragmatic view of truth anything differentfrom what I now describe; and inasmuch as my use of the term came earlier than my friend's, I think it ought to havethe right of way. But I suspect that Professor Pratt's contention is not solely as to what one must think in order to becalled a pragmatist. I am sure that he believes that the truth-relation has something more in it than the fundamentumwhich I assign can account for. Useful to test truth by, the matrix of circumstance, he thinks, cannot found the truth-relation in se, for that is transempirical and 'saltatory.'Well, take an object and an idea, and assume that the latter is true of the former—as eternally and absolutely true asyou like. Let the object be as much 'as' the idea thinks it, as it is possible for one thing to be 'as' another. I nowformally ask of Professor Pratt to tell what this 'as'-ness in itself consists in—for it seems to me that it ought toconsist in something assignable and describable, and not remain a pure mystery,"},{"pageNumber":963,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP912 hl[01 03 2011 16 33 35]Page 912and I promise that if he can assign any determination of it whatever which I cannot successfully refer to somespecification of what in this article I have called the empirical fundamentum, I will confess my stupidity cheerfully,and will agree never to publish a line upon this subject of truth again.IIProfessor Pratt has returned to the charge in a whole book,1 which for its clearness and good temper deserves tosupersede all the rest of the anti-pragmatistic literature. I wish it might do so; for its author admits all my essentialcontentions, simply distinguishing my account of truth as 'modified' pragmatism from Schiller's and Dewey's, whichhe calls pragmatism of the 'radical' sort. As I myself understand Dewey and Schiller, our views absolutely agree, inspite of our different modes of statement; but I have enough trouble of my own in life without having to defend myfriends, so I abandon them provisionally to the tender mercy of Professor Pratt's interpretations, utterly erroneous tho Ideem these to be. My reply as regards myself can be very short, for I prefer to consider only essentials, and Dr. Pratt'swhole book hardly takes the matter farther than the article to which I retort in Part I of the present paper.He repeats the 'as'-formula, as if it were something that I, along with other pragmatists, had denied,2 whereas I haveonly asked those who insist so on its importance to do something more than merely utter it—to explicate it, forexample, and tell us what its so great importance consists in. I myself agree most cordially that for an idea to be truethe object must be 'as' the idea declares it, but I explicate the 'as'-ness as meaning the idea's verifiability.Now since Dr. Pratt denies none of these verifying 'workings' for which I have pleaded, but only insists on theirinability to serve as the fundamentum of the truth-relation, it seems that there is really nothing in the line of fact aboutwhich we differ, and that the issue between us is solely as to1J. B. Pratt: What is Pragmatism. New York, The Macmillan Company, 1909.—The comments I have printed were written in March,1909, after some of the articles printed later in the present volume.2Op. cit., pp. 77 80."},{"pageNumber":964,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP913 hl[01 03 2011 16 34 42]Page 913how far the notion of workableness or verifiability is an essential part of the notion of 'trueness'—'trueness' being Dr.Pratt's present name for the character of as-ness in the true idea. I maintain that there is no meaning left in this notionof as-ness or trueness if no reference to the possibility of concrete working on the part of the idea is made.Take an example where there can be no possible working. Suppose I have an idea to which I give utterance by thevocable 'skrkl,' claiming at the same time that it is true. Who now can say that it is false, for why may there not besomewhere in the unplumbed depths of the cosmos some object with which 'skrkl' can agree and have trueness in Dr.Pratt's sense? On the other hand who can say that it is true, for who can lay his hand on that object and show that itand nothing else is what I mean by my word? But yet again, who can gainsay any one who shall call my word utterlyirrelative to other reality, and treat it as a bare fact in my mind, devoid of any cognitive function whatever. One ofthese three alternatives must surely be predicated of it. For it not to be irrelevant (or not-cognitive in nature), anobject of some kind must be provided which it may refer to. Supposing that object provided, whether 'skrkl' is true orfalse of it, depends, according to Professor Pratt, on no intermediating condition whatever. The trueness or the falsityis even now immediately, absolutely, and positively there.I, on the other hand, demand a cosmic environment of some kind to establish which of them is there rather than utterirrelevancy.1 I then say, first, that unless some sort of a natural path exists between the 'skrkl' and that object,distinguishable among the innumerable pathways that run among1Dr. Pratt, singularly enough, disposes of this primal postulate of all pragmatic epistemology, by saying that the pragmatist 'unconsciouslysurrenders his whole case by smuggling in the idea of a conditioning environment which determines whether or not the experience canwork, and which cannot itself be identified with the experience or any part of it' (pp. 167 168). The 'experience' means here of course theidea, or belief; and the expression 'smuggling in' is to the last degree diverting. If any epistemologist could dispense with a conditioningenvironment, it would seem to be the anti-pragmatist, with his immediate saltatory trueness, independent of work done. The mediatingpathway which the environment supplies is the very essence of the pragmatist's explanation."},{"pageNumber":965,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP914 hl[01 03 2011 16 35 49]Page 914all the realities of the universe, linking them promiscuously with one another, there is nothing there to constitute eventhe possibility of its referring to that object rather than to any other.I say furthermore that unless it have some tendency to follow up that path, there is nothing to constitute its intention torefer to the object in question.Finally, I say that unless the path be strown with possibilities of frustration or encouragement, and offer some sort ofterminal satisfaction or contradication, there is nothing to constitute its agreement or disagreement with that object, orto constitute the as-ness (or 'not-as-ness') in which the trueness (or falseness) is said to consist.I think that Dr. Pratt ought to do something more than repeat the name 'trueness,' in answer to my pathetic questionwhether that there be not some constitution to a relation as important as this. The pathway, the tendency, thecorroborating or contradicting progress, need not in every case be experienced in full, but I don't see, if the universedoes n't contain them among its possibilities of furniture, what logical material for defining the trueness of my idea isleft. But if it do contain them, they and they only are the logical material required.I am perplexed by the superior importance which Dr. Pratt attributes to abstract trueness over concrete verifiability inan idea, and I wish that he might be moved to explain. It is prior to verification, to be sure, but so is the verifiabilityfor which I contend prior, just as a man's 'mortality' (which is nothing but the possibility of his death) is prior to hisdeath, but it can hardly be that this abstract priority of all possibility to its correlative fact is what so obstinate aquarrel is about. I think it probable that Dr. Pratt is vaguely thinking of something concrete than this. The trueness ofan idea must mean something definite in it that determines its tendency to work, and indeed towards this object ratherthan towards that. Undoubtedly there is something of this sort in the idea, just as there is something in man thataccounts for his tendency towards death, and in bread that accounts for its tendency to nourish. What that something isin the case of truth psychology tells us: the idea has associates peculiar to itself, motor as"},{"pageNumber":966,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP915 hl[01 03 2011 16 36 56]Page 915well as ideational; it tends by its place and nature to call these into being, one after another; and the appearance ofthem in succession is what we mean by the 'workings' of the idea. According to what they are, does the trueness orfalseness which the idea harbored come to light. These tendencies have still earlier conditions which, in a generalway, biology, psychology and biography can trace. This whole chain of natural causal conditions produces a resultantstate of things in which new relations, not simply causal, can now be found, or into which they can now beintroduced,—the relations namely which we epistemologists study, relations of adaptation, of substitutability, ofinstrumentality, of reference and of truth.The prior causal conditions, altho there could be no knowing of any kind, true or false, without them, are butpreliminary to the question of what makes the ideas true or false when once their tendencies have been obeyed. Thetendencies must exist in some shape anyhow, but their fruits are truth, falsity, or irrelevancy, according to what theyconcretely turn out to be. They are not 'saltatory' at any rate, for they evoke their consequences contiguously, fromnext to next only; and not until the final result of the whole associative sequence, actual or potential, is in our mentalsight, can we feel sure what its epistemological significance, if it have any, may be. True knowing is, in fine, notsubstantially, in itself, or 'as such,' inside of the idea from the first, any more than mortality as such is inside of theman, or nourishment as such inside of the bread. Something else is there first, that practically makes for knowing,dying or nourishing, as the case may be. That something is the 'nature' namely of the first term, be it idea, man, orbread, that operates to start the causal chain of processes which, when completed, is the complex fact to which wegive whatever functional name best fits the case. Another nature, another chain of cognitive workings; and then eitheranother object known or the same object known differently, will ensue.Dr. Pratt perplexes me again by seeming to charge Dewey and Schiller1 (I am not sure that he charges me) with an ac-1Page 200."},{"pageNumber":967,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP916 hl[01 03 2011 16 38 04]Page 916count of truth which would allow the object believed in not to exist, even if the belief in it were true. 'Since the truthof an idea,' he writes, 'means merely the fact that the idea works, that fact is all that you mean when you say the idea istrue' (p. 206). 'When you say the idea is true'—does that mean true for you, the critic, or true for the believer whomyou are describing? The critic's trouble over this seems to come from his taking the word 'true' irrelatively, whereasthe pragmatist always means 'true for him who experiences the workings.' 'But is the object really true or not?'—thecritic then seems to ask,—as if the pragmatist were bound to throw in a whole ontology on top of his epistemologyand tell us what realities indubitably exist. 'One world at a time,' would seem to be the right reply here.One other trouble of Dr. Pratt's must be noticed. It concerns the 'transcendence' of the object. When our ideas haveworked so as to bring us flat up against the object, next to it, 'is our relation to it then ambulatory or saltatory?' Dr.Pratt asks. If your headache be my object, 'my experiences break off where yours begin,' Dr. Pratt writes, and 'this factis of great importance, for it bars out the sense of transition and fulfillment which forms so important an element inthe pragmatist description of knowledge—the sense of fulfillment due to a continuous passage from the original ideato the known object. If this comes at all when I know your headache, it comes not with the object, but quite on myside of the ''epistemological gulf.\" The gulf is still there to be transcended' (p. 158).Some day of course, or even now somewhere in the larger life of the universe, different men's headaches may becomeconfluent or be 'co-conscious.' Here and now, however, headaches do transcend each other and, when not felt, can beknown only conceptually. My idea is that you really have a headache; it works well with what I see of yourexpression, and with what I hear you say; but it doesn't put me in possession of the headache itself. I am still at oneremove, and the headache 'transcends' me, even tho it be in nowise transcendent of human experience generally. Butthe 'gulf' here is that which the pragmatist epistemology itself fixes in the very first words it uses, by saying there mustbe an object and an idea. The idea however does n't immediately leap the gulf, it"},{"pageNumber":968,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP917 hl[01 03 2011 16 39 11]Page 917only works from next to next so as to bridge it, fully or approximately. If it bridges it, in the pragmatist's vision of hishypothetical universe, it can be called a 'true' idea. If it only might bridge it, but does n't, or if it throws a bridgedistinctly at it, it still has, in the onlooking pragmatist's eyes, what Professor Pratt calls 'trueness.' But to ask thepragmatist thereupon whether, when it thus fails to coalesce bodily with the object, it is really true or has realtrueness,—in other words whether the headache he supposes, and supposes the thinker he supposes, to believe in, be areal headache or not,—is to step from his hypothetical universe of discourse into the altogether different world ofnatural fact."},{"pageNumber":969,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP918 hl[01 03 2011 16 40 18]Page 918VIIIThe Pragmatist Account of Truth and its Misunderstanders1The account of truth given in my volume entitled Pragmatism, continues to meet with such persistentmisunderstanding that I am tempted to make a final brief reply. My ideas may well deserve refutation, but they canget none till they are conceived of in their proper shape. The fantastic character of the current misconceptions showshow unfamiliar is the concrete point of view which pragmatism assumes. Persons who are familiar with a conceptionmove about so easily in it that they understand each other at a hint, and can converse without anxiously attending totheir P's and Q's. I have to admit, in view of the results, that we have assumed too ready an intelligence, andconsequently in many places used a language too slipshod. We should never have spoken elliptically. The critics haveboggled at every word they could boggle at, and refused to take the spirit rather than the letter of our discourse. Thisseems to show a genuine unfamiliarity in the whole point of view. It also shows, I think, that the second stage ofopposition, which has already begun to express itself in the stock phrase that 'what is new is not true, and what is truenot new,' in pragmatism, is insincere. If we said nothing in any degree new, why was our meaning so desperately hardto catch? The blame cannot be laid wholly upon our obscurity of speech, for in other subjects we have attained tomaking ourselves understood. But recriminations are tasteless; and, as far as I personally am concerned, I am sure thatsome of the misconception I complain of is due to my doctrine of truth being surrounded in that volume of popularlectures by a lot of other opinions not necessarily implicated with it, so that a reader may very naturally have grownconfused. For this I am to blame,—likewise for omitting certain explicit cautions, which the pages that follow willnow in part supply.1Reprint from the Philosophical Review, January, 1908 (vol. xvii, p. 1)."},{"pageNumber":970,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP919 hl[01 03 2011 16 41 25]Page 919First misunderstanding: Pragmatism is only a re-editing of positivism.This seems the commonest mistake. Scepticism, positivism, and agnosticism agree with ordinary dogmatic rationalismin presupposing that everybody knows what the word 'truth' means, without further explanation. But the formerdoctrines then either suggest or declare that real truth, absolute truth, is inaccessible to us, and that we must fain putup with relative or phenomenal truth as its next best substitute. By scepticism this is treated as an unsatisfactory stateof affairs, while positivism and agnosticism are cheerful about it, call real truth sour grapes, and consider phenomenaltruth quite sufficient for all our 'practical' purposes.In point of fact, nothing could be farther from all this than what pragmatism has to say of truth. Its thesis is analtogether previous one. It leaves off where these other theories begin, having contented itself with the word truth'sdefinition. 'No matter whether any mind extant in the universe possess truth or not,' it asks, 'what does the notion oftruth signify ideally?' 'What kind of things would true judgments be in case they existed?' The answer whichpragmatism offers is intended to cover the most complete truth that can be conceived of, 'absolute' truth if you like, aswell as truth of the most relative and imperfect description. This question of what truth would be like if it did exist,belongs obviously to a purely speculative field of inquiry. It is not a theory about any sort of reality, or about whatkind of knowledge is actually possible; it abstracts from particular terms altogether, and defines the nature of apossible relation between two of them.As Kant's question about synthetic judgments had escaped previous philosophers, so the pragmatist question is notonly so subtile as to have escaped attention hitherto, but even so subtile, it would seem, that when openly broachednow, dogmatists and sceptics alike fail to apprehend it, and deem the pragmatist to be treating of something whollydifferent. He insists, they say (I quote an actual critic), 'that the greater problems are insoluble by human intelligence,that our need of knowing truly is artificial and illusory, and that our reason, incapable of reaching the foundations ofreality, must turn"},{"pageNumber":971,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP920 hl[01 03 2011 16 42 33]Page 920itself exclusively towards action.' There could not be a worse misapprehension.Second misunderstanding: Pragmatism is primarily an appeal to action.The name 'pragmatism,' with its suggestions of action, has been an unfortunate choice, I have to admit, and has playedinto the hands of this mistake. But no word could protect the doctrine from critics so blind to the nature of the inquirythat, when Dr. Schiller speaks of ideas 'working' well, the only thing they think of is their immediate workings in thephysical environment, their enabling us to make money, or gain some similar 'practical' advantage. Ideas do work thus,of course, immediately or remotely; but they work indefinitely inside of the mental world also. Not crediting us withthis rudimentary insight, our critics treat our view as offering itself exclusively to engineers, doctors, financiers, andmen of action generally, who need some sort of a rough and ready weltanschauung, but have no time or wit to studygenuine philosophy. It is usually described as a characteristically American movement, a sort of bobtailed scheme ofthought, excellently fitted for the man on the street, who naturally hates theory and wants cash returns immediately.It is quite true that, when the refined theoretic question that pragmatism begins with is once answered, secondarycorollaries of a practical sort follow. Investigation shows that, in the function called truth, previous realities are notthe only independent variables. To a certain extent our ideas, being realities, are also independent variables, and, justas they follow other reality and fit it, so, in a measure, does other reality follow and fit them. When they addthemselves to being, they partly redetermine the existent, so that reality as a whole appears incompletely definableunless ideas also are kept account of. This pragmatist doctrine, exhibiting our ideas as complemental factors of reality,throws open (since our ideas are instigators of our action) a wide window upon human action, as well as a widelicense to originality in thought. But few things could be sillier than to ignore the prior epistemological edifice inwhich the window is built, or to talk as if pragmatism began and ended at the window. This, nevertheless, is"},{"pageNumber":972,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP921 hl[01 03 2011 16 43 40]Page 921what our critics do almost without exception. They ignore our primary step and its motive, and make the relation toaction, which is our secondary achievement, primary.Third misunderstanding: Pragmatists cut themselves off from the right to believe in ejective realities.They do so, according to the critics, by making the truth of our beliefs consist in their verifiability, and theirverifiability in the way in which they do work for us. Professor Stout, in his otherwise admirable and hopeful reviewof Schiller in Mind for October, 1897, considers that this ought to lead Schiller (could he sincerely realize the effectsof his own doctrine) to the absurd consequence of being unable to believe genuinely in another man's headache, evenwere the headache there. He can only 'postulate' it for the sake of the working value of the postulate to himself. Thepostulate guides certain of his acts and leads to advantageous consequences; but the moment he understands fully thatthe postulate is true only (!) in this sense, it ceases (or should cease) to be true for him that the other man really has aheadache. All that makes the postulate most precious then evaporates: his interest in his fellow-man 'becomes a veiledform of self-interest, and his world grows cold, dull, and heartless.'Such an objection makes a curious muddle of the pragmatist's universe of discourse. Within that universe thepragmatist finds some one with a headache or other feeling, and some one else who postulates that feeling. Asking onwhat condition the postulate is 'true,' the pragmatist replies that, for the postulator at any rate, it is true just inproportion as to believe in it works in him the fuller sum of satisfactions. What is it that is satisfactory here? Surely tobelieve in the postulated object, namely, in the really existing feeling of the other man. But how (especially if thepostulator were himself a thoroughgoing pragmatist) could it ever be satisfactory to him not to believe in that feeling,so long as, in Professor Stout's words, disbelief 'made the world seem to him cold, dull, and heartless'? Disbeliefwould seem, on pragmatist principles, quite out of the question under such conditions, unless the heartlessness of theworld were made probable already on other grounds. And since the belief in the headache,"},{"pageNumber":973,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP922 hl[01 03 2011 16 44 47]Page 922true for the subject assumed in the pragmatist's universe of discourse, is also true for the pragmatist who for hisepistemologizing purposes has assumed that entire universe, why is it not true in that universe absolutely? Theheadache believed in is a reality there, and no extant mind disbelieves it, neither the critic's mind nor his subject's!Have our opponents any better brand of truth in this real universe of ours that they can show us?1So much for the third misunderstanding, which is but one specification of the following still wider one.Fourth misunderstanding: No pragmatist can be a realist in his epistemology.This is supposed to follow from his statement that the truth of our beliefs consists in general in their givingsatisfaction. Of course satisfaction per se is a subjective condition; so the conclusion is drawn that truth falls whollyinside of the subject, who then may manufacture it at his pleasure. True beliefs1I see here a chance to forestall a criticism which some one may make on Lecture III of my Pragmatism, where, on pp. 528 529, I saidthat 'God' and 'Matter' might be regarded as synonymous terms, so long as no differing future consequences were deducible from the twoconceptions. The passage was transcribed from my address at the California Philosophical Union, reprinted in the Journal of Philosophy,vol. i, p. 673. I had no sooner given the address than I perceived a flaw in that part of it; but I have left the passage unaltered ever since,because the flaw did not spoil its illustrative value. The flaw was evident when, as a case analogous to that of a godless universe, Ithought of what I called an 'automatic sweetheart,' meaning a soulless body which should be absolutely indistinguishable from aspiritually animated maiden, laughing, talking, blushing, nursing us, and performing all feminine offices as tactfully and sweetly as if asoul were in her. Would any one regard her as a full equivalent? Certainly not, and why? Because, framed as we are, our egoism cravesabove all things inward sympathy and recognition, love and admiration. The outward treatment is valued mainly as an expression, as amanifestation of the accompanying a consciousness believed in. Pragmatically, then, belief in the automatic sweetheart would not work,and in point of fact no one treats it as a serious hypothesis. The godless universe would be exactly similar. Even if matter could do everyoutward thing that God does, the idea of it would not work as satisfactorily, because the chief call for a God on modern men's part is fora being who will inwardly recognize them and judge them sympathetically. Matter disappoints this craving of our ego, so God remainsfor most men the truer hypothesis, and indeed remains so for definite pragmatic reasons."},{"pageNumber":974,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP923 hl[01 03 2011 16 45 55]Page 923become thus wayward affections, severed from all responsibility to other parts of experience.It is difficult to excuse such a parody of the pragmatist's opinion, ignoring as it does every element but one of hisuniverse of discourse. The terms of which that universe consists positively forbid any non-realistic interpretation ofthe function of knowledge defined there. The pragmatizing epistemologist posits there a reality and a mind with ideas.What, now, he asks, can make those ideas true of that reality? Ordinary epistemology contents itself with the vaguestatement that the ideas must 'correspond' or 'agree'; the pragmatist insists on being more concrete, and asks what such'agreement' may mean in detail. He finds first that the ideas must point to or lead towards that reality and no other, andthen that the pointings and leadings must yield satisfaction as their result. So far the pragmatist is hardly less abstractthan the ordinary slouchy epistemologist; but as he defines himself farther, he grows more concrete. The entire quarrelof the intellectualist with him is over his concreteness, intellectualism contending that the vaguer and more abstractaccount is here the more profound. The concrete pointing and leading are conceived by the pragmatist to be the workof other portions of the same universe to which the reality and the mind belong, intermediary verifying bits ofexperience with which the mind at one end, and the reality at the other, are joined. The 'satisfaction,' in turn, is noabstract satisfaction überhaupt, felt by an unspecified being, but is assumed to consist of such satisfactions (in theplural) as concretely existing men actually do find in their beliefs. As we humans are constituted in point of fact, wefind that to believe in other men's minds, in independent physical realities, in past events, in eternal logical relations,is satisfactory. We find hope satisfactory. We often find it satisfactory to cease to doubt. Above all we find consistencysatisfactory, consistency between the present idea and the entire rest of our mental equipment, including the wholeorder of our sensations, and that of our intuitions of likeness and difference, and our whole stock of previouslyacquired truths.The pragmatist, being himself a man, and imagining in general no contrary lines of truer belief than ours about the"},{"pageNumber":975,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP924 hl[01 03 2011 16 47 02]Page 924'reality' which he has laid at the base of his epistemological discussion, is willing to treat our satisfactions as possiblyreally true guides to it, not as guides true solely for us. It would seem here to be the duty of his critics to show withsome explicitness why, being our subjective feelings, these satisfactions can not yield 'objective' truth. The beliefswhich they accompany 'posit' the assumed reality, 'correspond' and 'agree' with it, and 'fit' it in perfectly definite andassignable ways, through the sequent trains of thought and action which form their verification, so merely to insist onusing these words abstractly instead of concretely is no way of driving the pragmatist from the field,—his moreconcrete account virtually includes his critic's. If our critics have any definite idea of a truth more objectivelygrounded than the kind we propose, why do they not show it more articulately? As they stand, they remind one ofHegel's man who wanted 'fruit,' but rejected cherries, pears, and grapes, because they were not fruit in the abstract.We offer them the full quart-pot, and they cry for the empty quart-capacity.But here I think I hear some critic retort as follows: 'If satisfactions are all that is needed to make truth, how about thenotorious fact that errors are so often satisfactory? And how about the equally notorious fact that certain true beliefsmay cause the bitterest dissatisfaction? Is n't it clear that not the satisfaction which it gives, but the relation of thebelief to the reality is all that makes it true? Suppose there were no such reality, and that the satisfactions yetremained: would they not then effectively work falsehood? Can they consequently be treated distinctively as the truth-builders? It is the inherent relation to reality of a belief that gives us that specific truth-satisfaction, compared withwhich all other satisfactions are the hollowest humbug. The satisfaction of knowing truly is thus the only one whichthe pragmatist ought to have considered. As a psychological sentiment, the anti-pragmatist gladly concedes it to him,but then only as a concomitant of truth, not as a constituent. What constitutes truth is not the sentiment, but the purelylogical or objective function of rightly cognizing the reality, and the pragmatist's failure to reduce this function tolower values is patent.'Such anti-pragmatism as this seems to me a tissue of con-"},{"pageNumber":976,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP925 hl[01 03 2011 16 48 10]Page 925fusion. To begin with, when the pragmatist says 'indispensable,' it confounds this with 'sufficient.' The pragmatist callssatisfactions indispensable for truth-building, but I have everywhere called them insufficient unless reality be alsoincidentally led to. If the reality assumed were cancelled from the pragmatist's universe of discourse, he wouldstraightway give the name of falsehoods to the beliefs remaining, in spite of all their satisfactoriness. For him, as forhis critic, there can be no truth if there is nothing to be true about. Ideas are so much flat psychological surface unlesssome mirrored matter gives them cognitive lustre. This is why as a pragmatist I have so carefully posited 'reality' abinitio, and why, throughout my whole discussion, I remain an epistemological realist.1The anti-pragmatist is guilty of the further confusion of imagining that, in undertaking to give him an account of whattruth formally means, we are assuming at the same time to provide a warrant for it, trying to define the occasionswhen he can be sure of materially possessing it. Our making it hinge on a reality so 'independent' that when it comes,truth comes, and when it goes, truth goes with it, disappoints this naïve expectation, so he deems our descriptionunsatisfactory. I suspect that under this confusion lies the still deeper one of not discriminating sufficiently betweenthe two notions, truth and reality. Realities are not true, they are; and beliefs are true of them. But I suspect that in theanti-pragmatist mind the two notions sometimes swap their attributes. The reality itself, I fear, is treated as if 'true,'and conversely. Whoso tells us of the one, it is then supposed, must also be telling us of the other; and a true ideamust in a manner be, or at least yield without extraneous aid, the reality it cognitively is possessed of.To this absolute-idealistic demand pragmatism simply opposes its non possumus. If there is to be truth, it says, bothrealities and beliefs about them must conspire to make it; but whether there ever is such a thing, or how anyone canbe sure that his own beliefs possess it, it never pretends to determine. That truth-satisfaction par excellence whichmay tinge a belief1I need hardly remind the reader that both sense-percepts and percepts of ideal relation (comparisons, etc.) should be classed among therealities. The bulk of our mental 'stock' consists of truths concerning these terms."},{"pageNumber":977,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP926 hl[01 03 2011 16 49 17]Page 926unsatisfactory in other ways, it easily explains as the feeling of consistency with the stock of previous truths, orsupposed truths, of which one's whole past experience may have left one in possession.But are not all pragmatists sure that their own belief is right? their enemies will ask at this point; and this leads me totheFifth misunderstanding: What pragmatists say is inconsistent with their saying so.A correspondent puts this objection as follows: 'When you say to your audience, ''pragmatism is the truth concerningtruth,\" the first truth is different from the second. About the first you and they are not to be at odds; you are not givingthem liberty to take or leave it according as it works satisfactorily or not for their private uses. Yet the second truth,which ought to describe and include the first, affirms this liberty. Thus the intent of your utterance seems to contradictthe content of it.'General scepticism has always received this same classic refutation. 'You have to dogmatize,' the rationalists say tothe sceptics, 'whenever you express the sceptical position; so your lives keep contradicting your thesis.' One wouldsuppose that the impotence of so hoary an argument to abate in the slightest degree the amount of general scepticismin the world might have led some rationalists themselves to doubt whether these instantaneous logical refutations aresuch fatal ways, after all, of killing off live mental attitudes. General scepticism is the live mental attitude of refusingto conclude. It is a permanent torpor of the will, renewing itself in detail towards each successive thesis that offers,and you can no more kill it off by logic than you can kill off obstinacy or practical joking. This is why it is soirritating. Your consistent sceptic never puts his scepticism into a formal proposition,—he simply chooses it as a habit.He provokingly hangs back when he might so easily join us in saying yes, but he is not illogical or stupid,—on thecontrary, he often impresses us by his intellectual superiority. This is the real scepticism that rationalists have to meet,and their logic does not even touch it.No more can logic kill the pragmatist's behavior: his act"},{"pageNumber":978,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP927 hl[01 03 2011 16 50 24]Page 927of utterance, so far from contradicting, accurately exemplifies the matter which he utters. What is the matter which heutters? In part, it is this, that truth, concretely considered, is an attribute of our beliefs, and that these are attitudes thatfollow satisfactions. The ideas around which the satisfactions cluster are primarily only hypotheses that challenge orsummon a belief to come and take its stand upon them. The pragmatist's idea of truth is just such a challenge. Hefinds it ultra-satisfactory to accept it, and takes his own stand accordingly. But, being gregarious as they are, men seekto spread their beliefs, to awaken imitation, to infect others. Why should not you also find the same beliefsatisfactory? thinks the pragmatist, and forthwith endeavors to convert you. You and he will then believe similarly;you will hold up your subject-end of a truth, which will be a truth objective and irreversible if the reality holds up theobject-end by being itself present simultaneously. What there is of self-contradiction in all this I confess I cannotdiscover. The pragmatist's conduct in his own case seems to me on the contrary admirably to illustrate his universalformula; and of all epistemologists, he is perhaps the only one who is irreproachably self-consistent.Sixth misunderstanding: Pragmatism explains not what truth is, but only how it is arrived at.In point of fact it tells us both, tells us what it is incidentally to telling us how it is arrived at,—for what is arrived atexcept just what the truth is? If I tell you how to get to the railroad station, don't I implicitly introduce you to thewhat, to the being and nature of that edifice? It is quite true that the abstract word 'how' has n't the same meaning asthe abstract word 'what,' but in this universe of concrete facts you cannot keep hows and what asunder. The reasonswhy I find it satisfactory to believe that any idea is true, the how of my arriving at that belief, may be among the veryreasons why the idea is true in reality. If not, I summon the anti-pragmatist to explain the impossibility articulately.His trouble seems to me mainly to arise from his fixed inability to understand how a concrete statement can possiblymean as much, or be as valuable, as an abstract one. I said"},{"pageNumber":979,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP928 hl[01 03 2011 16 51 32]Page 928above that the main quarrel between us and our critics was that of concreteness versus abstractness. This is the placeto develop that point farther.In the present question, the links of experience sequent upon an idea, which mediate between it and a reality, formand for the pragmatist indeed are, the concrete relation of truth that may obtain between the idea and that reality.They, he says, are all that we mean when we speak of the idea 'pointing' to the reality, 'fitting' it, 'corresponding' withit, or 'agreeing' with it,—they or other similar mediating trains of verification. Such mediating events make the idea'true.' The idea itself, if it exists at all, is also a concrete event: so pragmatism insists that truth in the singular is only acollective name for truths in the plural, these consisting always of series of definite events; and that whatintellectualism calls the truth, the inherent truth, of any one such series is only the abstract name for its truthfulness inact, for the fact that the ideas there do lead to the supposed reality in a way that we consider satisfactory.The pragmatist himself has no objection to abstractions. Elliptically, and 'for short,' he relies on them as much as anyone, finding upon innumerable occasions that their comparative emptiness makes of them useful substitutes for theover-fulness of the facts he meets with. But he never ascribes to them a higher grade of reality. The full reality of atruth for him is always some process of verification, in which the abstract property of connecting ideas with objectstruly is workingly embodied. Meanwhile it is endlessly serviceable to be able to talk of properties abstractly and apartfrom their working, to find them the same in innumerable cases, to take them 'out of time,' and to treat of theirrelations to other similar abstractions. We thus form whole universes of platonic ideas ante rem, universes in posse,tho none of them exists effectively except in rebus. Countless relations obtain there which nobody experiences asobtaining,—as, in the eternal universe of musical relations, for example, the notes of Aennchen von Tharau were alovely melody long ere mortal ears ever heard them. Even so the music of the future sleeps now, to be awakenedhereafter. Or, if we take the world of geometrical relations, the thousandth decimal of p sleeps there, tho no one"},{"pageNumber":980,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP929 hl[01 03 2011 16 52 39]Page 929may ever try to compute it. Or, if we take the universe of 'fitting,' countless coats 'fit' backs, and countless boots 'fit'feet, on which they are not practically fitted; countless stones 'fit' gaps in walls into which no one seeks to fit themactually. In the same way countless opinions 'fit' realities, and countless truths are valid, tho no thinker ever thinksthem.For the anti-pragmatist these prior timeless relations are the presupposition of the concrete ones, and possess theprofounder dignity and value. The actual workings of our ideas in verification-processes are as naught in comparisonwith the 'obtainings' of this discarnate truth within them.For the pragmatist, on the contrary, all discarnate truth is static, impotent, and relatively spectral, full truth being thetruth that energizes and does battle. Can any one suppose that the sleeping quality of truth would ever have beenabstracted or have received a name, if truths had remained forever in that storage-valult of essential timeless'agreements' and had never been embodied in any panting struggle of men's live ideas for verification? Surely no morethan the abstract property of 'fitting' would have received a name, if in our world there had been no backs or feet orgaps in walls to be actually fitted. Existential truth is incidental to the actual competition of opinions. Essential truth,the truth of the intellectualists, the truth with no one thinking it, is like the coat that fits tho no one has ever tried it on,like the music that no ear has listened to. It is less real, not more real, than the verified article; and to attribute asuperior degree of glory to it seems little more than a piece of perverse abstraction-worship. As well might a pencilinsist that the outline is the essential thing in all pictorial representation, and chide the paint-brush and the camera foromitting it, forgetting that their pictures not only contain the whole outline, but a hundred other things in addition.Pragmatist truth contains the whole of intellectualist truth and a hundred other things in addition. Intellectualist truthis then only pragmatist truth in posse. That on innumerable occasions men do substitute truth in posse or verifiability,for verification or truth in act, is a fact to which no one attributes more importance than the pragmatist: he emphasizesthe practical utility of such a habit. But he does not on that account consider truth in posse,"},{"pageNumber":981,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP930 hl[01 03 2011 16 53 46]Page 930—truth not alive enough ever to have been asserted or questioned or contradicted,—to be the metaphysically priorthing, to which truths in act are tributary and subsidiary. When intellectualists do this, pragmatism charges them withinverting the real relation. Truth in posse means only truths in act; and he insists that these latter take precedence inthe order of logic as well as in that of being.Seventh misunderstanding: Pragmatism ignores the theoretic interest.This would seem to be an absolutely wanton slander, were not a certain excuse to be found in the linguistic affinitiesof the word 'pragmatism,' and in certain offhand habits of speech of ours which assumed too great a generosity on ourreader's part. When we spoke of the meaning of ideas consisting in their 'practical' consequences, or of the 'practical'differences which our beliefs make to us; when we said that the truth of a belief consists in its 'working' value, etc.;our language evidently was too careless, for by 'practical' we were almost unanimously held to mean opposed totheoretical or genuinely cognitive, and the consequence was punctually drawn that a truth in our eyes could have norelation to any independent reality, or to any other truth, or to anything whatever but the acts which we might groundon it or the satisfactions they might bring. The mere existence of the idea, all by itself, if only its results weresatisfactory, would give full truth to it, it was charged, in our absurd pragmatist epistemology. The solemn attributionof this rubbish to us was also encouraged by two other circumstances. First, ideas are practically useful in the narrowsense, false ideas sometimes, but most often ideas which we can verify by the sum total of all their ladings, and thereality of whose objects may thus be considered established beyond doubt. That these ideas should be true in advanceof and apart from their utility, that, in other words, their objects should be really there, is the very condition of theirhaving that kind of utility,—the objects they connect us with are so important that the ideas which serve as theobjects' substitutes grow important also. This manner of their practical working was the first thing that made truthsgood in the eyes of primitive men; and buried"},{"pageNumber":982,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP931 hl[01 03 2011 16 54 53]Page 931among all the other good workings by which true beliefs are characterized, this kind of subsequential utility remains.The second misleading circumstance was the emphasis laid by Schiller and Dewey on the fact that, unless a truth berelevant to the mind's momentary predicament, unless it be germane to the 'practical' situation,—meaning by this thequite particular perplexity,—it is no good to urge it. It does n't meet our interests any better than a falsehood wouldunder the same circumstances. But why our predicaments and perplexities might not be theoretical here as well asnarrowly practical, I wish that our critics would explain. They simply assume that no pragmatist can admit agenuinely theoretic interest. Having used the phrase 'cash-value' of an idea, I am implored by one correspondent toalter it, 'for every one thinks you mean only pecuniary profit and loss.' Having said that the true is 'the expedient inour thinking,' I am rebuked in this wise by another learned correspondent: 'The word expedient has no other meaningthat that of self-interest. The pursuit of this has ended by landing a number of officers of national banks inpenitentiaries. A philosophy that leads tosuch results must be unsound.'But the word 'practical' is so habitually loosely used that more indulgence might have been expected. When one saysthat a sick man has now practically recovered, or that an enterprise has practically failed, one usually means just theopposite of practically in the literal sense. One means that, altho untrue in strict practice, what one says is true intheory, true virtually, certain to be true. Again, by the practical one often means the distinctively concrete, theindividual, particular, and effective, as opposed to the abstract, general, and inert. To speak for myself, whenever Ihave emphasized the practical nature of truth, this is mainly what has been in my mind. 'Pragmata' are things in theirplurality; and in that early California address, when I described pragmatism as holding that 'the meaning of anyproposition can always be brought down to some particular consequence in our future practical experience, whetherpassive or active,' I expressly added these qualifying words: 'the point lying rather in the fact that the experience mustbe particular than in the fact that it must be active,'—by 'active' meaning here 'practical' in the narrow"},{"pageNumber":983,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP932 hl[01 03 2011 16 56 01]Page 932literal sense.1 But particular consequences can perfectly well be of a theoretic nature. Every remote fact which weinfer from an idea is a particular theoretic consequence which our mind partically works towards. The loss of everyold opinion of ours which we see that we shall have to give up if a new opinion be true, is a particular theoretic aswell as a particular practical consequence. After man's interest in breathing freely, the greatest of all his interests(because it never fluctuates or remits, as most of his physical interests do), is his interest in consistency, in feeling thatwhat he now thinks goes with what he thinks on other occasions. We tirelessly compare truth with truth for this solepurpose. Is the present candidate for belief perhaps contradicted by principle number one? Is it compatible with factnumber two? and so forth. The particular operations here are the purely logical ones of analysis, deduction,comparison, etc.; and altho general terms may be used ad libitum, the satisfactory practical working of the candidate-idea consists in the consciousness yielded by each successive theoretic consequence in particular. It is therefore simplyidiotic to repeat that pragmatism takes no account of purely theoretic interests. All it insists on is that verity in actmeans verifications, and that these are always particulars. Even in exclusively theoretic matters, it insists thatvagueness and generality serve to verify nothing.Eighth misunderstanding: Pragmatism is shut up to solipsism.I have already said something about this misconception under the third and fourth heads, above, but a little more maybe helpful. The objection is apt to clothe itself in words like these: 'You make truth to consist in every value exceptthe cognitive value proper; you always leave your knower at1The ambiguity of the word 'practical' comes out well in these words of a recent would-be reporter of our views: 'Pragmatism is anAnglo-Saxon reaction against the intellectualism and rationalism of the Latin mind. Man, each individual man is the measure of things.He is able to conceive none but relative truths, that is to say, illusions. What these illusions are worth is revealed to him, not by generaltheory, but by individual practice. Pragmatism, which consists in experiencing these illusions of the mind and obeying them by actingthem out, is a philosophy without words, a philosophy of gestures and of acts, which abandons what is general and holds only to what isparticular.' (Bourdeau, in Journal des Débats, October 29, 1907.)"},{"pageNumber":984,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP933 hl[01 03 2011 16 57 08]Page 933many removes (or, at the uttermost, at one remove) from his real object; the best you do is to let his ideas carry himtowards it; it remains forever outside of him,' etc.I think that the leaven working here is the rooted intellectualist persuasion that, to know a reality, an idea must insome inscrutable fashion possess or be it.1 For pragmatism this kind of coalescence is inessential. As a rule ourcognitions are only processes of mind off their balance and in motion towards real termini; and the reality of thetermini, believed in by the states of mind in question, can be guaranteed only by some wider knower.2 But if there isno reason extant in the universe why they should be doubted, the beliefs are true in the only sense in which anythingcan be true anyhow: they are practically and concretely true, namely. True in the mystical mongrel sense of anIdentitätsphilosophie they need not be; nor is there any intelligible reason why they ever need be true otherwise thanverifiably and practically. It is reality's part to possess its own existence; it is thought's part to get into 'touch' with itby innumerable paths of verification.I fear that the 'humanistic' developments of pragmatism may cause a certain difficulty here. We get at one truth onlythrough the rest of truth; and the reality, everlastingly postulated as that which all our truth must keep in touch with,may never be given to us save in the form of truth other than1Sensations may, indeed, possess their objects or coalesce with them, as common sense supposes that they do; and intuited differencesbetween concepts may coalesce with the 'eternal' objective differences; but to simplify our discussion here we can afford to abstractfrom these very special cases of knowing.2The transcendental idealist thinks that, in some inexplicable way, the finite states of mind are identical with the transfinite all-knower whichhe finds himself obliged to postulate in order to supply a fundamentum for the relation of knowing, as he apprehends it. Pragmatists can leavethe question of identity open; but they cannot do without the wider knower any more than they can do without the reality, if they want toprove a case of knowing. They themselves play the part of the absolute knower for the universe of discourse which serves them as materialfor epistemologizing. They warrant the reality there, and the subject's true knowledge, there, of it. But whether what they themselves sayabout that whole universe is objectively true, i. e., whether the pragmatic theory of truth is true really, they cannot warrant,—they can onlybelieve it. To their hearers they can only propose it, as I propose it to my readers, as something to be verified ambulando, or by the way inwhich its consequences may confirm it."},{"pageNumber":985,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP934 hl[01 03 2011 16 58 15]Page 934that which we are now testing. But since Dr. Schiller has shown that all our truths, even the most elemental, areaffected by race-inheritance with a human coefficient, reality perse thus may appear only as a sort of limit; it may beheld to shrivel to the mere place for an object, and what is known may be held to be only matter of our psyche thatwe fill the place with.It must be confessed that pragmatism, worked in this humanistic way, is compatible with solipsism. It joins friendlyhands with the agnostic part of kantism, with contemporary agnosticism, and with idealism generally. But workedthus, it is a metaphysical theory about the matter of reality, and flies far beyond pragmatism's own modest analysis ofthe nature of the knowing function, which analysis may just as harmoniously be combined with less humanisticaccounts of reality. One of pragmatism's merits is that it is so purely epistemological. It must assume realities; but itprejudges nothing as to their constitution, and the most diverse metaphysics can use it as their foundation. It certainlyhas no special affinity with solipsism.As I look back over what I have written, much of it gives me a queer impression, as if the obvious were set forth socondescendingly that readers might well laugh at my pomposity. It may be, however, that concreteness as radical asours is not so obvious. The whole originality of pragmatism, the whole point in it, is its use of the concrete way ofseeing. It begins with concreteness, and returns and ends with it. Dr. Schiller, with his two 'practical' aspects of truth,(1) relevancy to situation, and (2) subsequential utility, is only filling the cup of concreteness to the brim for us. Onceseize that cup, and you cannot misunderstand pragmatism. It seems as if the power of imagining the world concretelymight have been common enough to let our readers apprehend us better, as if they might have read between our lines,and, in spite of all our infelicities of expression, guessed a little more correctly what our thought was. But alas! thiswas not on fate's programme, so we can only think, with the German ditty:—\"Es wär' zu schön gewesen,Es hat nicht sollen sein.\""},{"pageNumber":986,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP935 hl[01 03 2011 16 59 23]Page 935IXThe Meaning of the Word Truth1My account of truth is realistic, and follows the epistemological dualism of common sense. Suppose I say to you 'Thething exists'—is that true or not? How can you tell? Not till my statement has developed its meaning farther is itdetermined as being true, false, or irrelevant to reality altogether. But if now you ask 'what thing?' and I reply 'a desk';if you ask 'where?' and I point to a place; if you ask 'does it exist materially, or only in imagination?' and I say'materially'; if moreover I say 'I mean that desk,' and then grasp and shake a desk which you see just as I havedescribed it, you are willing to call my statement true. But you and I are commutable here; we can exchange places;and, as you go bail for my desk, so I can go bail for yours.This notion of a reality independent of either of us, taken from ordinary social experience, lies at the base of thepragmatist definition of truth. With some such reality any statement, in order to be counted true, must agree.Pragmatism defines 'agreeing' to mean certain ways of 'working,' be they actual or potential. Thus, for my statement'the desk exists' to be true of a desk recognized as real by you, it must be able to lead me to shake your desk, toexplain myself by words that suggest that desk to your mind, to make a drawing that is like the desk you see, etc. Onlyin such ways as this is there sense in saying it agrees with that reality, only thus does it gain for me the satisfaction ofhearing you corroborate me. Reference then to something determinate, and some sort of adaptation to it worthy of thename of agreement, are thus constituent elements in the definition of any statement of mine as 'true.'You cannot get at either the reference or the adaptation without using the notion of the workings. That the thing is,what it is, and which it is (of all the possible things with that what) are points determinable only by the pragmaticmethod. The 'which' means a possibility of pointing, or of otherwise1Remarks at the meeting of the American Philosophical Association, Cornell University, December, 1907."},{"pageNumber":987,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP936 hl[01 03 2011 17 00 30]Page 936singling out the special object; the 'what' means choice on our part of an essential aspect to conceive it by (and this isalways relative to what Dewey calls our own 'situation'); and the 'that' means our assumption of the attitude of belief,the reality-recognizing attitude. Surely for understanding what the word 'true' means as applied to a statement, themention of such workings is indispensable. Surely if we leave them out the subject and the object of the cognitiverelation float—in the same universe, 't is true—but vaguely and ignorantly and without mutual contact or mediation.Our critics nevertheless call the workings inessential. No functional possibilities 'make' our beliefs true, they say; theyare true inherently, true positively, born 'true' as the Count of Chambord was born 'Henri-Cinq.' Pragmatism insists, onthe contrary, that statements and beliefs are thus inertly and statically true only by courtesy: they practically pass fortrue; but you cannot define what you mean by calling them true without referring to their functional possibilities.These give its whole logical content to that relation to reality on a belief's part to which the name 'truth' is applied, arelation which otherwise remains one of mere coexistence or bare withness.The foregoing statements reproduce the essential content of the lecture on Truth in my book Pragmatism. Schiller'sdoctrine of 'humanism,' Dewey's 'Studies in logical theory,' and my own 'radical empiricism,' all involve this generalnotion of truth as 'working,' either actual or conceivable. But they envelop it as only one detail in the midst of muchwider theories that aim eventually at determining the notion of what 'reality' at large is in its ultimate nature andconstitution."},{"pageNumber":988,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP937 hl[01 03 2011 17 01 38]Page 937XThe Existence of Julius Cæsar1My account of truth is purely logical and relates to its definition only. I contend that you cannot tell what the word'true' means, as applied to a statement, without invoking the concept of the statement's workings.Assume, to fix our ideas, a universe composed of two things only: imperial Cæsar dead and turned to clay, and me,saying 'Cæsar really existed.' Most persons would naïvely deem truth to be thereby uttered, and say that by a sort ofactio in distans my statement had taken direct hold of the other fact.But have my words so certainly denoted that Cæsar?—or so certainly connoted his individual attributes? To fill outthe complete measure of what the epithet 'true' may ideally mean, my thought ought to bear a fully determinate andunambiguous 'one-to-one-relation' to its own particular object. In the ultra-simple universe imagined the reference isuncertified. Were there two Cæsars we should n't know which was meant. The conditions of truth thus seemincomplete in this universe of discourse so that it must be enlarged.Transcendentalists enlarge it by invoking an absolute mind which, as it owns all the facts, can sovereignly correlatethem. If it intends that my statement shall refer to that identical Cæsar, and that the attributes I have in mind shallmean his attributes, that intention suffices to make the statement true.I, in turn, enlarge the universe by admitting finite intermediaries between the two original facts. Cæsar had, and mystatement has, effects; and if these effects in any way run together, a concrete medium and bottom is provided for thedeterminate cognitive relation, which, as a pure actio in distans, seemed to float too vaguely and unintelligibly.The real Cæsar, for example, wrote a manuscript of which I see a real reprint, and say 'the Cæsar I mean is the authorof that.' The workings of my thought thus determine both its1Originally printed under the title of 'Truth versus Truthfulness,' in the Journal of Philosophy."},{"pageNumber":989,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP938 hl[01 03 2011 17 02 45]Page 938denotative and its connotative significance more fully. It now defines itself as neither irrelevant to the real Cæsar, norfalse in what it suggests of him. The absolute mind, seeing me thus working towards Cæsar through the cosmicintermediaries, might well say: 'Such workings only specify in detail what I meant myself by the statement being true.I decree the cognitive relation between the two original facts to mean that just that kind of concrete chain ofintermediaries exists or can exist.'But the chain involves facts prior to the statement the logical conditions of whose truth we are defining, and factssubsequent to it; and this circumstance, coupled with the vulgar employment of the terms truth and fact as synonyms,has laid my account open to misapprehension. 'How,' it is confusedly asked, 'can Cæsar's existence, a truth already2000 years old, depend for its truth on anything about to happen now? How can my acknowledgment of it be madetrue by the acknowledgment's own effects? The effects may indeed confirm my belief, but the belief was made truealready by the fact that Cæsar really did exist.'Well, be it so, for if there were no Cæsar, there could, of course, be no positive truth about him—but then distinguishbetween 'true' as being positively and completely so established, and 'true' as being so only 'practically,' elliptically,and by courtesy, in the sense of not being positively irrelevant or untrue. Remember also that Cæsar's having existedin fact may make a present statement false or irrelevant as well as it may make it true, and that in neither case does ititself have to alter. It being given, whether truth, untruth, or irrelevancy shall be also given depends on somethingcoming from the statement itself. What pragmatism contends for is that you cannot adequately define the something ifyou leave the notion of the statement's functional workings out of your account. Truth meaning agreement with reality,the mode of the agreeing is a practical problem which the subjective term of the relation alone can solve.NOTE. This paper was originally followed by a couple of paragraphs meant to conciliate the intellectualist opposition. Since you love theword 'true' so, and since you despise so the concrete working of our ideas, I said, keep the word 'truth' for the saltatory andincomprehensible relation you care so much(footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":990,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP939 hl[01 03 2011 17 03 52]Page 939(footnote continued from previous page)for, and I will say of thoughts that know their objects in an intelligible sense that they are 'truthful.'Like most offerings, this one has been spurned, so I revoke it, repenting of my generosity. Professor Pratt, in his recent book, calls anyobjective state of facts 'a truth,' and uses the word 'trueness' in the sense of 'truth' as proposed by me. Mr. Hawtrey (see below, page 966) uses'correctness' in the same sense. Apart from the general evil of ambiguous vocabularies, we may really forsake all hope, if the term 'truth' isofficially to lose its status as a property of our beliefs and opinions, and become recognized as a technical synonym for 'fact.'"},{"pageNumber":991,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP940 hl[01 03 2011 17 04 59]Page 940XIThe Absolute and the Strenuous Life1Professor W. A. Brown, in the Journal for August 15, approves my pragmatism for allowing that a belief in theabsolute may give holidays to the spirit, but takes me to task for the narrowness of this concession, and shows bystriking examples how great a power the same belief may have in letting loose the strenuous life.I have no criticism whatever to make upon his excellent article, but let me explain why 'moral holidays' were the onlygift of the absolute which I picked out for emphasis. I was primarily concerned in my lectures with contrasting thebelief that the world is still in process of making with the belief that there is an 'eternal' edition of it ready-made andcomplete. The former, or 'pluralistic' belief, was the one that my pragmatism favored. Both beliefs confirm ourstrenuous moods. Pluralism actually demands them, since it makes the world's salvation depend upon the energizing ofits several parts, among which we are. Monism permits them, for however furious they may be, we can always justifyourselves in advance for indulging them by the thought that they will have been expressions of the absolute's perfectlife. By escaping from your finite perceptions to the conception of the eternal whole, you can hallow any tendencywhatever. Tho the absolute dictates nothing, it will sanction anything and everything after the fact, for whatever isonce there will have to be regarded as an integral member of the universe's perfection. Quietism and frenzy thus alikereceive the absolute's permit to exist. Those of us who are naturally inert may abide in our resigned passivity; thosewhose energy is excessive may grow more reckless still. History shows how easily both quietists and fanatics havedrawn inspiration from the absolutistic scheme. It suits sick souls and strenuous ones equally well.One cannot say thus of pluralism. Its world is always vulnerable, for some part may go astray; and having no 'eternal'edition of it to draw comfort from, its partisans must always1Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy, etc., 1906."},{"pageNumber":992,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP941 hl[01 03 2011 17 06 06]Page 941feel to some degree insecure. If, as pluralists, we grant ourselves moral holidays, they can only be provisonalbreathing-spells, intended to refresh us for the morrow's fight. This forms one permanent inferiority of pluralism fromthe pragmatic point of view. It has no saving message for incurably sick souls. Absolutism, among its other messages,has that message, and is the only scheme that has it necessarily. That constitutes its chief superiority and is the sourceof its religious power. That is why, desiring to do it full justice, I valued its aptitude for moral-holiday giving sohighly. Its claims in that way are unique, whereas its affinities with strenuousness are less emphatic than those of thepluralistic scheme.In the last lecture of my book I candidly admitted this inferiority of pluralism. It lacks the wide indifference thatabsolutism shows. It is bound to disappoint many sick souls whom absolutism can console. It seems therefore poortactics for absolutists to make little of this advantage. The needs of sick souls are surely the most urgent; and believersin the absolute should rather hold it to be great merit in their philosophy that it can meet them so well.The pragmatism or pluralism which I defend has to fall back on a certain ultimate hardihood, a certain willingness tolive without assurances or guarantees. To minds thus willing to live on possibilities that are not certainties, quietisticreligion, sure of salvation any how, has a slight flavor of fatty degeneration about it which has caused it to be lookedaskance on, even in the church. Which side is right here, who can say? Within religion, emotion is apt to betyrannical; but philosophy must favor the emotion that allies itself best with the whole body and drift of all the truthsin sight. I conceive this to be the more strenuous type of emotion; but I have to admit that its inability to let loosequietistic raptures is a serious deficiency in the pluralistic philosophy which I profess."},{"pageNumber":993,"pageContent":" Page 942XIIProfessor Hébert on Pragmatism1Professor Marcel Hébert is a singularly erudite and liberal thinker (a seceder, I believe, from the Catholic priesthood)and an uncommonly direct and clear writer. His book Le Divin is one of the ablest reviews of the general subject ofreligious philosophy which recent years have produced; and in the small volume the title of which is copied above hehas, perhaps, taken more pains not to do injustice to pragmatism than any of its numerous critics. Yet the usual fatalmisapprehension of its purposes vitiates his exposition and his critique. His pamphlet seems to me to form a worthyhook, as it were, on which to hang one more attempt to tell the reader what the pragmatist account of truth reallymeans.M. Hébert takes it to mean what most people take it to mean, the doctrine, namely, that whatever proves subjectivelyexpedient in the way of our thinking is 'true' in the absolute and unrestricted sense of the word, whether it correspondsto any objective state of things outside of our thought or not. Assuming this to be the pragmatist thesis, M. Hébertopposes it at length. Thought that proves itself to be thus expedient may, indeed, have every other kind of value forthe thinker, he says, but cognitive value, representative value, valeur de connaissance proprement dite, it has not; andwhen it does have a high degree of general utility value, this is in every case derived from its previous value in theway of correctly representing independent objects that have an important influence on our lives. Only by thusrepresenting things truly do we reap the useful fruits. But the fruits follow on the truth, they do not constitute it; so M.Hébert accuses pragmatism of telling us everything about truth except what it essentially is. He admits, indeed, thatthe world is so framed that when men have true ideas of realities, consequential utilities ensue in abundance; and noone of our critics, I think, has shown as1Reprint from the Journal of Philosophy for December 3, 1908 (vol. v, p. 689), of a review of Le pragmatisme et ses diverses formesanglo-américaines, by Marcel Hébert.

Pp. 105.)"},{"pageNumber":994,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP943 hl[01 03 2011 17 07 14]Page 943concrete a sense of the variety of these utilities as he has; but he reiterates that, whereas such utilities are secondary,we insist on treating them as primary, and that the connaissance objective from which they draw all their being issomething which we neglect, exclude, and destroy. The utilitarian value and the strictly cognitive value of our ideasmay perfectly well harmonize, he says—and in the main he allows that they do harmonize—but they are not logicallyidentical for that. He admits that subjective interests, desires, impulses may even have the active 'primacy' in ourintellectual life. Cognition awakens only at their spur, and follows their cues and aims; yet, when it is awakened, it isobjective cognition proper and not merely another name for the impulsive tendencies themselves in the state ofsatisfaction. The owner of a picture ascribed to Corot gets uneasy when its authenticity is doubted. He looks up itsorigin and is reassured. But his uneasiness does not make the proposition false, any more than his relief makes theproposition true, that the actual Corot was the painter. Pragmatism, which, according to M. Hébert, claims that oursentiments make truth and falsehood, would oblige us to conclude that our minds exert no genuinely cognitivefunction whatever.This subjectivist interpretation of our position seems to follow from my having happened to write (without supposingit necessary to explain that I was treating of cognition solely on its subjective side) that in the long run the true is theexpedient in the way of our thinking, much as the good is the expedient in the way of our behavior! Havingpreviously written that truth means 'agreement with reality,' and insisted that the chief part of the expediency of anyone opinion is its agreement with the rest of acknowledged truth, I apprehended no exclusively subjectivist reading ofmy meaning. My mind was so filled with the notion of objective reference that I never dreamed that my hearers wouldlet go of it; and the very last accusation I expected was that in speaking of ideas and their satisfactions, I was denyingrealities outside. My only wonder now is that critics should have found so silly a personage as I must have seemed intheir eyes, worthy of explicit refutation.The object, for me, is just as much one part of reality as"},{"pageNumber":995,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP944 hl[01 03 2011 17 08 22]Page 944the idea is another part. The truth of the idea is one relation of it to the reality, just as its date and its place are otherrelations. All three relations consist of intervening parts of the universe which can in every particular case be assignedand catalogued, and which differ in every instance of truth, just as they differ with every date and place.The pragmatist thesis, as Dr. Schiller and I hold it,—I prefer to let Professor Dewey speak for himself,—is that therelation called 'truth' is thus concretely definable. Ours is the only articulate attempt in the field to say positively whattruth actually consists of. Our denouncers have literally nothing to oppose to it as an alternative. For them, when anidea is true, it is true, and there the matter terminates, the word 'true' being indefinable. The relation of the true idea toits object, being, as they think, unique, it can be expressed in terms of nothing else, and needs only to be named forany one to recognize and understand it. Moreover it is invariable and universal, the same in every single instance oftruth, however diverse the ideas, the realities, and the other relations between them may be.Our pragmatist view, on the contrary, is that the truth-relation is a definitely experienceable relation, and thereforedescribable as well as namable; that it is not unique in kind, and neither invariable nor universal. The relation to itsobject that makes an idea true in any given instance, is, we say, embodied in intermediate details of reality which leadtowards the object, which vary in every instance, and which in every instance can be concretely traced. The chain ofworkings which an opinion sets up is the opinion's truth, falsehood, or irrelevancy, as the case may be. Every idea thata man has works some consequences in him, in the shape either of bodily actions or of other ideas. Through theseconsequences the man's relations to surrounding realities are modified. He is carried nearer to some of them andfarther from others, and gets now the feeling that the idea has worked satisfactorily, now that it has not. The idea hasput him into touch with something that fulfils its intent, or it has not.This something is the man's object, primarily. Since the only realities we can talk about are such objects-believed-in,the pragmatist, whenever he says 'reality,' means in the first"},{"pageNumber":996,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP945 hl[01 03 2011 17 09 29]Page 945instance what may count for the man himself as a reality, what he believes at the moment to be such. Sometimes thereality is a concrete sensible presence. The idea, for example, may be that a certain door opens into a room where aglass of beer may be bought. If opening the door leads to the actual sight and taste of the beer, the man calls the ideatrue. Or his idea may be that of an abstract relation, say of that between the sides and the hypothenuse of a triangle,such a relation being, of course, a reality quite as much as a glass of beer is. If the thought of such a relation leads himto draw auxiliary lines and to compare the figures they make, he may at last, perceiving one equality after another, seethe relation thought of, by a vision quite as particular and direct as was the taste of the beer. If he does so, he callsthat idea, also, true. His idea has, in each case, brought him into closer touch with a reality felt at the moment toverify just that idea. Each reality verifies and validates its own idea exclusively; and in each case the verificationconsists in the satisfactorily-ending consequences, mental or physical, which the idea was able to set up. These'workings' differ in every single instance, they never transcend experience, they consist of particulars, mental orsensible, and they admit of concrete description in every individual case. Pragmatists are unable to see what you canpossibly mean by calling an idea true, unless you mean that between it as a terminus a quo in some one's mind andsome particular reality as a terminus ad quem, such concrete workings do or may intervene. Their direction constitutesthe idea's reference to that reality, their satisfactoriness constitutes its adaptation thereto, and the two things togetherconstitute the 'truth' of the idea for its possessor. Without such intermediating portions of concretely real experiencethe pragmatist sees no materials out of which the adaptive relation called truth can be built up.The anti-pragmatist view is that the workings are but evidences of the truth's previous inherent presence in the idea,and that you can wipe the very possibility of them out of existence and still leave the truth of the idea as solid as ever.But surely this is not a counter-theory of truth to ours. It is the renunciation of all articulate theory. It is but a claim tothe right to call certain ideas true anyhow; and this is what I"},{"pageNumber":997,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP946 hl[01 03 2011 17 10 36]Page 946meant above by saying that the anti-pragmatists offer us no real alternative, and that our account is literally the onlypositive theory extant. What meaning, indeed, can an idea's truth have save its power of adapting us either mentally orphysically to a reality?How comes it, then, that our critics so uniformly accuse us of subjectivism, of denying the reality's existence? Itcomes, I think, from the necessary predominance of subjective language in our analysis. However independent andejective realities may be, we can talk about them, in framing our accounts of truth, only as so many objects believed-in. But the process of experience leads men so continually to supersede their older objects by newer ones which theyfind it more satisfactory to believe in, that the notion of an absolute reality inevitably arises as a grenzbegriff,equivalent to that of an object that shall never be superseded, and belief in which shall be endgültig. Cognitively wethus live under a sort of rule of three: as our private concepts represent the sense-objects to which they lead us, thesebeing public realities independent of the individual, so these sense-realities may, in turn, represent realities of ahypersensible order, electrons, mind-stuff, God, or what not, existing independently of all human thinkers. The notionof such final realities, knowledge of which would be absolute truth, is an outgrowth of our cognitive experience fromwhich neither pragmatists nor anti-pragmatists escape. They form an inevitable regulative postulate in every one'sthinking. Our notion of them is the most abundantly suggested and satisfied of all our beliefs, the last to suffer doubt.The difference is that our critics use this belief as their sole paradigm, and treat any one who talks of human realitiesas if he thought the notion of reality 'in itself' illegitimate. Meanwhile, reality-in-itself, so far as by them talked of, isonly a human object; they postulate it just as we postulate it; and if we are subjectivists they are so no less. Realitiesin themselves can be there for any one, whether pragmatist or anti-pragmatist, only by being believed; they arebelieved only by their notions appearing true; and their notions appear true only because they work satisfactorily.Satisfactorily, moreover, for the particular thinker's purpose. There is no idea which is the true idea, of anything.Whose is the true idea of the"},{"pageNumber":998,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP947 hl[01 03 2011 17 11 43]Page 947absolute? Or to take M. Hébert's example, what is the true idea of a picture which you possess? It is the idea that mostsatisfactorily meets your present interest. The interest may be in the picture's place, its age, its 'tone,' its subject, itsdimensions, its authorship, its price, its merit, or what not. If its authorship by Corot have been doubted, what willsatisfy the interest aroused in you at that moment will be to have your claim to own a Corot confirmed; but, if youhave a normal human mind, merely calling it a Corot will not satisfy other demands of your mind at the same time.For them to be satisfied, what you learn of the picture must make smooth connection with what you know of the restof the system of reality in which the actual Corot played his part. M. Hébert accuses us of holding that the proprietarysatisfactions of themselves suffice to make the belief true, and that, so far as we are concerned, no actual Corot needever have existed. Why we should be thus cut off from the more general and intellectual satisfactions, I know not; butwhatever the satisfactions may be, intellectual or proprietary, they belong to the subjective side of the truth-relation.They found our beliefs; our beliefs are in realities; if no realities are there, the beliefs are false; but if realities arethere, how they can ever be known without first being believed; or how believed except by our first having ideas ofthem that work satisfactorily, pragmatists find it impossible to imagine. They also find it impossible to imagine whatmakes the anti-pragmatists' dogmatic 'ipse dixit' assurance of reality more credible than the pragmatists' convictionbased on concrete verifications. M. Hébert will probably agree to this, when put in this way, so I do not see ourinferiority to him in the matter of connaissance proprement dite.Some readers will say that, altho I may possibly believe in realities beyond our ideas, Dr. Schiller, at any rate, doesnot. This is a great misunderstanding, for Schiller's doctrine and mine are identical, only our expositions followdifferent directions. He starts from the subjective pole of the chain, the individual with his beliefs, as the moreconcrete and immediately given phenomenon. 'An individual claims his belief to be true,' Schiller says, 'but what doeshe mean by true?"},{"pageNumber":999,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP948 hl[01 03 2011 17 12 51]Page 948and how does he establish the claim?' With these questions we embark on a psychological inquiry. To be true, itappears, means, for that individual, to work satisfactorily for him; and the working and the satisfaction, since theyvary from case to case, admit of no universal description. What works is true and represents a reality, for theindividual for whom it works. If he is infallible, the reality is 'really' there; if mistaken it is not there, or not there as hethinks it. We all believe, when our ideas work satisfactorily; but we don't yet know who of us is infallible; so that theproblem of truth and that of error are ebenbürtig and arise out of the same situations. Schiller, remaining with thefallible individual, and treating only of reality-for-him, seems to many of his readers to ignore reality-in-itselfaltogether. But that is because he seeks only to tell us how truths are attained, not what the content of those truths,when attained, shall be. It may be that the truest of all beliefs shall be that in transsubjective realities. It certainlyseems the truest, for no rival belief is as voluminously satisfactory, and it is probably Dr. Schiller's own belief; but heis not required, for his immediate purpose, to profess it. Still less is he obliged to assume it in advance as the basis ofhis discussion.I, however, warned by the ways of critics, adopt different tactics. I start from the object-pole of the idea-reality chainand follow it in the opposite direction from Schiller's. Anticipating the results of the general truth-processes ofmankind, I begin with the abstract notion of an objective reality. I postulate it, and ask on my own account, I vouchingfor this reality, what would make any one else's idea of it true for me as well as for him. But I find no differentanswer from that which Schiller gives. If the other man's idea leads him, not only to believe that the reality is there,but to use it as the reality's temporary substitute, by letting it evoke adaptive thoughts and acts similar to those whichthe reality itself would provoke, then it is true in the only intelligible sense, true through its particular consequences,and true for me as well as for the man.My account is more of a logical definition; Schiller's is more of a psychological description. Both treat an absolutelyidentical matter of experience, only they traverse it in opposite ways."},{"pageNumber":1000,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP949 hl[01 03 2011 17 13 58]Page 949Possibly these explanations may satisfy M.

Useful, because we are then reminded of other things that offerthose same aspects; and, if the aspects carry consequences in those other things, we can return to our first things,expecting those same consequences to accrue.To be helped to anticipate consequences is always a gain, and such being the help that abstract concepts give us, it isobvious that their use is fulfilled only when we get back again into concrete particulars by their means, bearing theconsequences in our minds, and enriching our notion of the original objects therewithal.Without abstract concepts to handle our perceptual particulars by, we are like men hopping on one foot. Usingconcepts along with the particulars, we become bipedal. We throw our concept forward, get a foothold on theconsequence, hitch our line to this, and draw our percept up, travelling thus with a hop, skip and jump over the surfaceof life at a vastly rapider rate than if we merely waded through the thickness of the particulars as accident rained themdown upon our heads. Animals have to do this, but men raise their heads higher and breathe freely in the upperconceptual air.The enormous esteem professed by all philosophers for the conceptual form of consciousness is easy to understand.From Plato's time downwards it has been held to be our sole avenue to essential truth. Concepts are universal,changeless, pure; their relations are eternal; they are spiritual, while the concrete particulars which they enable us tohandle are corrupted by the flesh. They are precious in themselves, then, apart from their original use, and confer newdignity upon our life.One can find no fault with this way of feeling about concepts so long as their original function does not get swallowedup in the admiration and lost. That function is of"},{"pageNumber":1002,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP951 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 12]Page 951course to enlarge mentally our momentary experiences by adding to them the consequences conceived; butunfortunately, that function is not only too often forgotten by philosophers in their reasonings, but is often convertedinto its exact opposite, and made a means of diminishing the original experience by denying (implicitly or explicitly)all its features save the one specially abstracted to conceive it by.This itself is a highly abstract way of stating my complaint, and it needs to be redeemed from obscurity by showinginstances of what is meant. Some beliefs very dear to my own heart have been conceived in this viciously abstractway by critics. One is the 'will to believe,' so called; another is the indeterminism of certain futures; a third is thenotion that truth may vary with the standpoint of the man who holds it. I believe that the perverse abuse of theabstracting function has led critics to employ false arguments against these doctrines, and often has led their readerstoo to false conclusions. I should like to try to save the situation, if possible, by a few counter-critical remarks.Let me give the name of 'vicious abstractionism' to a way of using concepts which may be thus described: Weconceive a concrete situation by singling out some salient or important feature in it, and classing it under that; then,instead of adding to its previous characters all the positive consequences which the new way of conceiving it maybring, we proceed to use our concept privatively; reducing the originally rich phenomenon to the naked suggestions ofthat name abstractly taken, treating it as a case of 'nothing but' that concept, and acting as if all the other charactersfrom out of which the concept is abstracted were expunged.1 Abstraction, functioning in this way, becomes a meansof arrest far more than a means of advance in thought. It mutilates things; it creates difficulties and findsimpossibilities; and more than half the trouble that metaphysicians and logicians give themselves over the paradoxesand dialectic puzzles of the universe may, I am convinced, be traced to this relatively simple source. The viciouslyprivative employment of abstract characters and class1Let not the reader confound the fallacy here described with legitimately negative inferences such as those drawn in the mood 'celarent'of the logic-books."},{"pageNumber":1003,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP952 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 13]Page 952names is, I am persuaded, one of the great original sins of the rationalistic mind.To proceed immediately to concrete examples, cast a glance at the belief in 'free will,' demolished with such speciouspersuasiveness recently by the skilful hand of Professor Fullerton.1 When a common man says that his will is free,what does he mean? He means that there are situations of bifurcation inside of his life in which two futures seem tohim equally possible, for both have their roots equally planted in his present and his past. Either, if realized, will growout of his previous motives, character and circumstances, and will continue uninterruptedly the pulsations of hispersonal life. But sometimes both at once are incompatible with physical nature, and then it seems to the naïveobserver as if he made a choice between them now, and that the question of which future is to be, instead of havingbeen decided at the foundation of the world, were decided afresh at every passing moment in which fact seemslivingly to grow, and possibility seems, in turning itself towards one act, to exclude all others.He who takes things at their face-value here may indeed be deceived. He may far too often mistake his privateignorance of what is predetermined for a real indetermination of what is to be. Yet, however imaginary it may be, hispicture of the situation offers no appearance of breach between the past and future. A train is the same train, itspassengers are the same passengers, its momentum is the same momentum, no matter which way the switch whichfixes its direction is placed. For the indeterminist there is at all times enough past for all the different futures in sight,and more besides, to find their reasons in it, and whichever future comes will slide out of that past as easily as thetrain slides by the switch. The world, in short, is just as continuous with itself for the believers in free will as for therigorous determinists, only the latter are unable to believe in points of bifurcation as spots of really indifferentequilibrium or as containing shunts which there—and there only, not before—direct existing motions without alteringtheir amount.1Popular Science Monthly, N. Y., vols. lviii and lix."},{"pageNumber":1004,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP953 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 14]Page 953Were there such spots of indifference, the rigorous determinists think, the future and the past would be separatedabsolutely, for, abstractly taken, the word 'indifferent' suggests disconnection solely. Whatever is indifferent is in sofar forth unrelated and detached. Take the term thus strictly, and you see, they tell us, that if any spot of indifferenceis found upon the broad highway between the past and the future, then no connection of any sort whatever, nocontinuous momentum, no identical passenger, no common aim or agent, can be found on both sides of the shunt orswitch which there is moved. The place is an impassable chasm.Mr. Fullerton writes—the italics are mine—as follows:—'In so far as my action is free, what I have been, what I am, what I have always done or striven to do, what I most earnestly wish orresolve to do at the present moment—these things can have no more to do with its future realization than if they had no existence. Thepossibility is a hideous one; and surely even the most ardent free-willist will, when he contemplates it frankly, excuse me for hopingthat if I am free I am at least not very free, and that I may reasonably expect to find some degree of consistency in my life and actions. Suppose that I have given a dollar to a blind beggar. Can I, if it is really an act of free-will, be properly said to have given the money?Was it given because I was a man of tender heart, etc., etc.? What has all this to do with acts of free-will? If they are free, they mustnot be conditioned by antecedent circumstances of any sort, by the misery of the beggar, by the pity in the heart of the passer-by. Theymust be causeless, not determined. They must drop from a clear sky out of the void, for just in so far as they can be accounted for, theyare not free.'1Heaven forbid that I should get entangled here in a controversy about the rights and wrongs of the free-will questionat large, for I am only trying to illustrate vicious abstractionism by the conduct of some of the doctrine's assailants.The moments of bifurcation, as the indeterminist seems to himself to experience them, are moments both of re-direction and of continuation. But because in the 'either—or' of the1Loc. cit., vol. lviii, pp. 189, 188."},{"pageNumber":1005,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP954 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 15]Page 954re-direction we hesitate, the determinist abstracts this little element of discontinuity from the superabundantcontinuities of the experience, and cancels in its behalf all the connective characters with which the latter is filled.Choice, for him, means henceforward dis connection pure and simple, something undetermined in advance in anyrespect whatever, and a life of choices must be a raving chaos, at no two moments of which could we be treated asone and the same man. If Nero were 'free' at the moment of ordering his mother's murder, Mr. McTaggart1 assures usthat no one would have the right at any other moment to call him a bad man, for he would then be an absolutely otherNero.A polemic author ought not merely to destroy his victim. He ought to try a bit to make him feel his error—perhaps notenough to convert him, but enough to give him a bad conscience and to weaken the energy of his defence. Theseviolent caricatures of men's beliefs arouse only contempt for the incapacity of their authors to see the situations out ofwhich the problems grow. To treat the negative character of one abstracted element as annulling all the positivefeatures with which it coexists, is no way to change any actual indeterminist's way of looking on the matter, tho it maymake the gallery applaud.Turn now to some criticisms of the 'will to believe,' as another example of the vicious way in which abstraction iscurrently employed. The right to believe in things for the truth of which complete objective proof is yet lacking isdefended by those who apprehend certain human situations in their concreteness. In those situations the mind hasalternatives before it so vast that the full evidence for either branch is missing, and yet so significant that simply towait for proof, and to doubt while waiting, might often in practical respects be the same thing as weighing down thenegative side. Is life worth while at all? Is there any general meaning in all this cosmic weather? Is anything beingpermanently bought by all this suffering? Is there perhaps a transmundane experience in Being, somethingcorresponding to a 'fourth dimension,'1Some Dogmas of Religion, p. 179."},{"pageNumber":1006,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP955 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 15]Page 955which, if we had access to it, might patch up some of this world's zerrissenheit and make things look more rationalthan they at first appear? Is there a superhuman consciousness of which our minds are parts, and from whichinspiration and help may come? Such are the questions in which the right to take sides practically for yes or no isaffirmed by some of us, while others hold that this is methodologically inadmissible, and summon us to die professingignorance and proclaiming the duty of every one to refuse to believe.I say nothing of the personal inconsistency of some of these critics, whose printed works furnish exquisite illustrationsof the will to believe, in spite of their denunciations of it as a phrase and as a recommended thing. Mr. McTaggart,whom I will once more take as an example, is sure that 'reality is rational and righteous' and 'destined sub specietemporis to become perfectly good'; and his calling this belief a result of necessary logic has surely never deceivedany reader as to its real genesis in the gifted author's mind. Mankind is made on too uniform a pattern for any of us toescape successfully from acts of faith. We have a lively vision of what a certain view of the universe would mean forus. We kindle or we shudder at the thought, and our feeling runs through our whole logical nature and animates itsworkings. It can't be that, we feel; it must be this. It must be what it ought to be, and it ought to be this; and then weseek for every reason, good or bad, to make this which so deeply ought to be, seem objectively the probable thing. Weshow the arguments against it to be insufficient, so that it may be true; we represent its appeal to be to our wholenature's loyalty and not to any emaciated faculty of syllogistic proof. We reinforce it by remembering the enlargementof our world by music, by thinking of the promises of sunsets and the impulses from vernal woods. And the essenceof the whole experience, when the individual swept through it says finally 'I believe,' is the intense concreteness of hisvision, the individuality of the hypothesis before him, and the complexity of the various concrete motives andperceptions that issue in his final state.But see now how the abstractionist treats this rich and intricate vision that a certain state of things must be true."},{"pageNumber":1007,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP956 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 16]Page 956He accuses the believer of reasoning by the following syllogism:—All good desires must be fulfilled;The desire to believe this proposition is a good desire;Ergo, this proposition must be believed.He substitutes this abstraction for the concrete state of mind of the believer, pins the naked absurdity of it upon him,and easily proves that any one who defends him must be the greatest fool on earth. As if any real believer ever thoughtin this preposterous way, or as if any defender of the legitimacy of men's concrete ways of concluding ever used theabstract and general premise, 'All desires must be fulfilled'! Nevertheless, Mr. McTaggart solemnly and laboriouslyrefutes the syllogism in sections 47 to 57 of the above-cited book. He shows that there is no fixed link in thedictionary between the abstract concepts 'desire,' 'goodness' and 'reality'; and he ignores all the links which in thesingle concrete case the believer feels and perceives to be there! He adds:—'When the reality of a thing is uncertain, the argument encourages us to suppose that our approval of a thing candetermine its reality. And when this unhallowed link has once been established, retribution overtakes us. For when thereality of the thing is independently certain, we [then] have to admit that the reality of the thing should determine ourapproval of that thing. I find it difficult to imagine a more degraded position.'One here feels tempted to quote ironically Hegel's famous equation of the real with the rational to his english disciple,who ends his chapter with the heroic words:—'For those who do not pray, there remains the resolve that, so far as their strength may permit, neither the pains ofdeath nor the pains of life shall drive them to any comfort in that which they hold to be false, or drive them from anycomfort [discomfort?] in that which they hold to be true.'How can so ingenious-minded a writer fail to see how far over the heads of the enemy all his arrows pass? When Mr.McTaggart himself believes that the universe is run by the dialectic energy of the absolute idea, his insistent desire tohave a world of that sort is felt by him to be no chance example of desire in general, but an altogether peculiar in-"},{"pageNumber":1008,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP957 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 16]Page 957sight-giving passion to which, in this if in no other instance, he would be stupid not to yield. He obeys its concretesingularity, not the bare abstract feature in it of being a 'desire.' His situation is as particular as that of an actress whoresolves that it is best for her to marry and leave the stage, of a priest who becomes secular, of a politician whoabandons public life. What sensible man would seek to refute the concrete decisions of such persons by tracing themto abstract premises, such as that 'all actresses must marry,' 'all clergymen must be laymen,' 'all politicians shouldresign their posts'? Yet this type of refutation, absolutely unavailing though it be for purposes of conversion, is spreadby Mr. McTaggart through many pages of his book. For the aboundingness of our real reasons he substitutes onenarrow point. For men's real probabilities he gives a skeletonized abstraction which no man was ever tempted tobelieve.The abstraction in my next example is less simple, but is quite as flimsy as a weapon of attack. Empiricists think thattruth in general is distilled from single men's beliefs; and the so-called pragmatists 'go them one better' by trying todefine what it consists in when it comes. It consists, I have elsewhere said, in such a working on the part of the beliefsas may bring the man into satisfactory relations with objects to which these latter point. The working is of course aconcrete working in the actual experience of human beings, among their ideas, feelings, perceptions, beliefs and acts,as well as among the physical things of their environment, and the relations must be understood as being possible aswell as actual. In the chapter on truth of my book Pragmatism I have taken pains to defend energetically this view.Strange indeed have been the misconceptions of it by its enemies, and many have these latter been. Among the mostformidable-sounding onslaughts on the attempt to introduce some concreteness into our notion of what the truth of anidea may mean, is one that has been raised in many quarters to the effect that to make truth grow in any way out ofhuman opinion is but to reproduce that protagorean doctrine that the individual man is 'the measure of all things,'which Plato in his immortal dialogue, the Thæatetus, is unanimously said to have laid away so comfortably in itsgrave two thousand years ago.

They accuse relativists—and we pragmatistsare typical relativists—of being debarred by their self-adopted principles, not only from the privilege which rationalistphilosophers enjoy, of believing that these principles of their own are truth impersonal and absolute, but even offraming the abstract notion of such a truth, in the pragmatic sense, of an ideal opinion in which all men might agree,and which no man should ever wish to change. Both charges fall wide of their mark. I myself, as a pragmatist, believein my own account of truth as firmly as any rationalist can possibly believe in his. And I believe in it for the veryreason that I have the idea of truth which my learned adversaries contend that no pragmatist can frame. I expect,namely, that the more fully men discuss and test my account, the more they will agree that it fits, and the less will theydesire a change. I may of course be premature in this confidence, and the glory of being truth final and absolute mayfall upon some later revision and correction of my scheme, which latter will then be judged untrue in just the measurein which it departs from that finally satisfactory formulation. To admit, as we pragmatists do, that we are liable tocorrection (even tho we may not expect it) involves the use on our part of an ideal standard. Rationalists themselvesare, as individuals, sometimes sceptical enough to admit the abstract possibility of their own present opinions beingcorrigible and revisable to some degree, so the fact that the mere notion of an absolute standard should seem to themso important a thing to claim for themselves and to deny to us is not easy to explain. If, along with the notion of thestandard, they could also claim its exclusive warrant for their own fulminations now, it would be important to themindeed. But absolutists like Rickert freely admit the sterility of the notion, even in their own hands. Truth is what weought to believe, they say, even tho no man ever did or shall believe1Münsterberg's book has just appeared in an english version: The Eternal Values, Boston, 1909."},{"pageNumber":1010,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP959 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 17]Page 959it, and even tho we have no way of getting at it save by the usual empirical processes of testing our opinions by oneanother and by facts. Pragmatically, then, this part of the dispute is idle. No relativist who ever actually walked theearth1 has denied the regulative character in his own thinking of the notion of absolute truth. What is challenged byrelativists is the pretence on any one's part to have found for certain at any given moment what the shape of that truthis. Since the better absolutists agree in this, admitting that the proposition 'There is absolute truth' is the only absolutetruth of which we can be sure,2 further debate is practically unimportant, so we may pass to their next charge.It is in this charge that the vicious abstractionism becomes most apparent. The anti-pragmatist, in postulating absolutetruth, refuses to give any account of what the words may mean. For him they form a self-explanatory term. Thepragmatist, on the contrary, articulately defines their meaning. Truth absolute, he says, means an ideal set offormulations towards which all opinions may in the long run of experience be expected to converge. In this definitionof absolute truth he not only postulates that there is a tendency to such convergence of opinions, to such ultimateconsensus, but he postulates the other factors of his definition equally, borrowing them by anticipation from the trueconclusions expected to be reached. He postulates the existence of opinions, he postulates that experience that will siftthem, and the consistency which that experience will show. He justifies himself in these assumptions by saying thatthey are not postulates in the strict1Of course the bugaboo creature called 'the sceptic' in the logic-books, who dogmatically makes the statement that no statement, not eventhe one he now makes, is true, is a mere mechanical toy-target for the rationalist shooting-gallery—hit him and he turns a summersault—yet he is the only sort of relativist whom my colleagues appear able to imagine to exist.2Compare Rickert's Gegenstand der Erkentniss, pp. 137, 138. Münsterberg's version of this first truth is that 'Es gibt eine Welt,'—see hisPhilosophie der Werte, pp. 38 and 74. And, after all, both these philosophers confess in the end that the primal truth of which they considerour supposed denial so irrational is not properly an insight at all, but a dogma adopted by the will which any one who turns his back on dutymay disregard! But if it all reverts to 'the will to believe,' pragmatists have that privilege as well as their critics."},{"pageNumber":1011,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP960 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 18]Page 960sense but simple inductions from the past extended to the future by analogy; and he insists that human opinion hasalready reached a pretty stable equilibrium regarding them, and that if its future development fails to alter them, thedefinition itself, with all its terms included, will be part of the very absolute truth which it defines. The hypothesiswill, in short, have worked successfully all round the circle and proved self-corroborative, and the circle will beclosed.The anti-pragmatist, however, immediately falls foul of the word 'opinion' here, abstracts it from the universe of life,and uses it as a bare dictionary-substantive, to deny the rest of the assumptions which it coexists withal. Thedictionary says that an opinion is 'what some one thinks or believes.' This definition leaves every one's opinion free tobe autogenous, or unrelated either to what any one else may think or to what the truth may be. Therefore, continueour abstractionists, we must conceive it as essentially thus unrelated, so that even were a billion men to sport the sameopinion, and only one man to differ, we could admit no collateral circumstances which might presumptively make itmore probable that he, not they, should be wrong. Truth, they say, follows not the counting of noses, nor is it onlyanother name for a majority vote. It is a relation that antedates experience, between our opinions and an independentsomething which the pragmatist account ignores, a relation which, tho the opinions of individuals should to alleternity deny it, would still remain to qualify them as false. To talk of opinions without referring to this independentsomething, the anti-pragmatist assures us, is to play Hamlet with Hamlet's part left out.But when the pragmatist speaks of opinions, does he mean any such insulated and unmotivated abstractions as arehere supposed? Of course not, he means men's opinions in the flesh, as they have really formed themselves, opinionssurrounded by their grounds and the influences they obey and exert, and along with the whole environment of socialcommunication of which they are a part and out of which they take their rise. Moreover the 'experience' which thepragmatic definition postulates is the independent something which the anti-pragmatist accuses him of ignoring.Already have men grown unanimous in the opinion that such experience is 'of'"},{"pageNumber":1012,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP961 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 18]Page 961an independent reality, the existence of which all opinions must acknowledge, in order to be true. Already do theyagree that in the long run it is useless to resist experience's pressure; that the more of it a man has, the better positionhe stands in, in respect of truth; that some men, having had more experience, are therefore better authorities thanothers; that some are also wiser by nature and better able to interpret the experience they have had; that it is one partof such wisdom to compare notes, discuss, and follow the opinion of our betters; and that the more systematically andthoroughly such comparison and weighing of opinions is pursued, the truer the opinions that survive are likely to be.When the pragmatist talks of opinions, it is opinions as they thus concretely and livingly and interactingly andcorrelatively exist that he has in mind; and when the anti-pragmatist tries to floor him because the word 'opinion' canalso be taken abstractly and as if it had no environment, he simply ignores the soil out of which the whole discussiongrows. His weapons cut the air and strike no blow. No one gets wounded in the war against caricatures of belief andskeletons of opinion of which the German onslaughts upon 'relativismus' consists. Refuse to use the word 'opinion'abstractly, keep it in its real environment, and the withers of pragmatism remain unwrung.That men do exist who are 'opinionated,' in the sense that their opinions are self-willed, is unfortunately a fact thatmust be admitted, no matter what one's notion of truth in general may be. But that this fact should make it impossiblefor truth to form itself authentically out of the life of opinion is what no critic has yet proved. Truth may well consistof certain opinions, and does indeed consist of nothing but opinions, tho not every opinion need be true. Nopragmatist needs to dogmatize about the consensus of opinion in the future being right—he need only postulate that itwill probably contain more of truth than any one's opinion now."},{"pageNumber":1013,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP962 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 19]Page 962XIVTwo English CriticsMr. Bertrand Russell's article entitled 'Transatlantic Truth,'1 has all the clearness, dialectic subtlety, and wit which oneexpects from his pen, but it entirely fails to hit the right point of view for apprehending our position. When, forinstance, we say that a true proposition is one the consequences of believing which are good, he assumes us to meanthat any one who believes a proposition to be true must first have made out clearly that its consequences are good,and that his belief must primarily be in that fact,—an obvious absurdity, for that fact is the deliverance of a newproposition, quite different from the first one and is, moreover, a fact usually very hard to verify, it being 'far easier,'as Mr. Russell justly says, 'to settle the plain question of fact: ''Have popes always been infallible?\" than to settle thequestion whether the effects of thinking them infallible are on the whole good.'We affirm nothing as silly as Mr. Russell supposes. Good consequences are not proposed by us merely as a sure sign,mark, or criterion, by which truth's presence is habitually ascertained, tho they may indeed serve on occasion as such asign; they are proposed rather as the lurking motive inside of every truth-claim, whether the 'trower' be conscious ofsuch motive, or whether he obey it blindly. They are proposed as the causa existendi of our beliefs, not as their logicalcue or premise, and still less as their objective deliverance or content. They assign the only intelligible practicalmeaning to that difference in our beliefs which our habit of calling them true or false comports.No truth-claimer except the pragmatist himself need ever be aware of the part played in his own mind byconsequences, and he himself is aware of it only abstractly and in general, and may at any moment be quite obliviousof it with respect to his own beliefs.Mr. Russell next joins the army of those who inform their1In the Albany Review for January, 1908."},{"pageNumber":1014,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP963 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 19]Page 963readers that according to the pragmatist definition of the word 'truth' the belief that A exists may be 'true,' even whenA does not exist. This is the usual slander, repeated to satiety by our critics. They forget that in any concrete accountof what is denoted by 'truth' in human life, the word can only be used relatively to some particular trower. Thus, I mayhold it true that Shakespere wrote the plays that bear his name, and may express my opinion to a critic. If the critic beboth a pragmatist and a baconian, he will in his capacity of pragmatist see plainly that the workings of my opinion, Ibeing what I am, make it perfectly true for me, while in his capacity of baconian he still believes that Shakesperenever wrote the plays in question. But most anti-pragmatist critics take the word 'truth' as something absolute, andeasily play on their reader's readiness to treat his own truths as the absolute ones. If the reader whom they addressbelieves that A does not exist, while we pragmatists show that those for whom the belief that it exists workssatisfactorily will always call it true, he easily sneers at the naïveté of our contention, for is not then the belief inquestion 'true,' tho what it declares as fact has, as the reader so well knows, no existence? Mr. Russell speaks of ourstatement as an 'attempt to get rid of fact' and naturally enough considers it 'a failure' (p. 410). 'The old notion of truthreappears,' he adds—that notion being, of course, that when a belief is true, its object does exist.It is, of course, bound to exist, on sound pragmatic principles. Concepts signify consequences. How is the world madedifferent for me by my conceiving an opinion of mine under the concept 'true'? First, an object must be findable there(or sure signs of such an object must be found) which shall agree with the opinion. Second, such an opinion must notbe contradicted by anything else of which I am aware. But in spite of the obvious pragmatist requirement that when Ihave said truly that something exists, it shall exist, the slander which Mr. Russell repeats has gained the widestcurrency.Mr. Russell himself is far too witty and athletic a ratiocinator simply to repeat the slander dogmatically. Being nothingif not mathematical and logical, he must prove the accusation secundum artem, and convict us not so much of error"},{"pageNumber":1015,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP964 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 20]Page 964as of absurdity. I have sincerely tried to follow the windings of his mind in this procedure, but for the life of me I canonly see in it another example of what I have called (above, p. 951) vicious abstractionism. The abstract world ofmathematics and pure logic is so native to Mr. Russell that he thinks that we describers of the functions of concretefact must also mean fixed mathematical terms and functions. A mathematical term, as a, b, c, x, y, sin., log., is self-sufficient, and terms of this sort, once equated, can be substituted for one another in endless series without error. Mr.Russell, and also Mr. Hawtrey, of whom I shall speak presently, seem to think that in our mouth also such terms as'meaning,' 'truth,' 'belief,' 'object,' 'definition,' are self-sufficients with no context of varying relation that might befurther asked about. What a word means is expressed by its definition, is n't it? The definition claims to be exact andadequate, does n't it? Then it can be substituted for the word—since the two are identical—can't it? Then two wordswith the same definition can be substituted for one another, n'est-ce pas? Likewise two definitions of the same word,nicht wahr, etc., etc., till it will be indeed strange if you can't convict some one of self-contradiction and absurdity.The particular application of this rigoristic treatment to my own little account of truth as working seems to besomething like what follows. I say 'working' is what the 'truth' of our ideas means, and call it a definition. But sincemeanings and things meant, definitions and things defined, are equivalent and interchangeable, and nothingextraneous to its definition can be meant when a term is used, it follows that whoso calls an idea true, and means bythat word that it works, cannot mean anything else, can believe nothing but that it does work, and in particular canneither imply nor allow anything about its object or deliverance. 'According to the pragmatists,' Mr. Russell writes, 'tosay \"it is true that other people exist\" means \"it is useful to believe that other people exist.\" But if so, then these twophrases are merely different words for the same proposition; therefore when I believe the one I believe the other' (p.400). [Logic, I may say in passing, would seem to require Mr. Russell to believe them both at once, but he"},{"pageNumber":1016,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP965 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 21]Page 965ignores this consequence, and considers that 'other people exist' and 'it is useful to believe that they do even if theydon't,' must be identical and therefore substitutable propositions in the pragmatist mouth.]But may not real terms, I now ask, have accidents not expressed in their definitions? and when a real value is finallysubstituted for the result of an algebraic series of substituted definitions, do not all these accidents creep back? Beliefshave their objective 'content' or 'deliverance' as well as their truth, and truth has its implications as well as itsworkings. If any one believe that other men exist, it is both a content of his belief and an implication of its truth, thatthey should exist in fact. Mr. Russell's logic would seem to exclude, 'by definition,' all such accidents as contents,implications, and associates, and would represent us as translating all belief into a sort of belief in pragmatism itself—of all things! If I say that a speech is eloquent, and explain 'eloquent' as meaning the power to work in certain waysupon the audience; or if I say a book is original, and define 'original' to mean differing from other books, Russell'slogic, if I follow it at all, would seem to doom me to agreeing that the speech is about eloquence, and the book aboutother books. When I call a belief true, and define its truth to mean its workings, I certainly do not mean that the beliefis a belief about the workings. It is a belief about the object, and I who talk about the workings am a different subject,with a different universe of discourse, from that of the believer of whose concrete thinking I profess to give anaccount.The social proposition 'other men exist' and the pragmatist proposition 'it is expedient to believe that other men exist'come from different universes of discourse. One can believe the second without being logically compelled to believethe first; one can believe the first without having ever heard of the second; or one can believe them both. The firstexpresses the object of a belief, the second tells of one condition of the belief's power to maintain itself. There is noidentity of nay kind, save the term 'other men' which they contain in common, in the two propositions; and to treatthem as mutually substitutable, or to insist that we shall do so, is to give up dealing with realities altogether."},{"pageNumber":1017,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP966 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 21]Page 966Mr. Ralph Hawtrey, who seems also to serve under the banner of abstractionist logic, convicts us pragmatists ofabsurdity by arguments similar to Mr. Russell's.1As a favor to us and for the sake of the argument, he abandons the word 'true' to our fury, allowing it to mean nothingbut the fact that certain beliefs are expedient; and he uses the word 'correctness' (as Mr. Pratt uses the word 'truencess')to designate a fact, not about the belief, but about the belief's object, namely that it is as the belief declares it. 'Whentherefore,' he writes, 'I say it is correct to say that Cæsar is dead, I mean \"Cæsar is dead.\" This must be regarded as thedefinition of correctness.' And Mr. Hawtrey then goes on to demolish me by the conflict of the definitions. What is'true' for the pragmatist cannot be what is 'correct,' he says, 'for the definitions are not logically interchangeable; or ifwe interchange them, we reach the tautology: \"Cæsar is dead\" means \"it is expedient to believe that Cæsar is dead.\"means \"it is expedient to believe that Cæsar is dead.\"' But what is it expedient to believe? Why, ''that Cæsar is dead.\"'A precious definition indeed of 'Cæsar is dead.'Mr. Hawtrey's conclusion would seem to be that the pragmatic definition of the truth of a belief in no way implies—what?—that the believer shall believe in his own belief's deliverance?—or that the pragmatist who is talking abouthim shall believe in that deliverance? The two cases are quite different. For the believer, Cæsar must of course reallyexist; for the pragmatist critic he need not, for the pragmatic deliverance belongs, as I have just said, to anotheruniverse of discourse altogether. When one argues by substituting definition for definition, one needs to stay in thesame universe.The great shifting of universes in this discussion occurs when we carry the word 'truth' from the subjective into theobjective realm, applying it sometimes to a property of opinions, sometimes to the facts which the opinions assert. Anumber of writers, as Mr. Russell himself, Mr. G. E. Moore, and others, favor the unlucky word 'proposition,' whichseems expressly invented to foster this confusion, for they1See The New Quarterly, for March, 1908."},{"pageNumber":1018,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP967 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 22]Page 967speak of truth as a property of 'propositions.' But in naming propositions it is almost impossible not to use the word'that.' That Cæsar is dead, that virtue is its own reward,are propositions.I do not say that for certain logical purposes it may not be useful to treat propositions as absolute entities, with truthor falsehood inside of them respectively, or to make of a complex like 'that-Cæsar-is-dead' a single term and call it a'truth.' But the 'that' here has the extremely convenient ambiguity for those who wish to make trouble for uspragmatists, that sometimes it means the fact that, and sometimes the belief that, Cæsar is no longer living. When Ithen call the belief true, I am told that the truth means the fact; when I claim the fact also, I am told that my definitionhas excluded the fact, being a definition only of a certain peculiarity in the belief—so that in the end I have no truthto talk about left in my possession.The only remedy for this intolerable ambiguity is, it seems to me, to stick to terms consistently. 'Reality,' 'idea' or'belief,' and the 'truth of the idea or belief,' which are the terms I have consistently held to, seem to be free from allobjection.Whoever takes terms abstracted from all their natural settings, identifies them with definitions, and treats the lattermore algebraico, not only risks mixing universes, but risks fallacies which the man in the street easily detects. Toprove 'by definition' that the statement 'Cæsar exists' is identical with a statement about 'expediency' because the onestatement is 'true' and the other is about 'true statements,' is like proving that an omnibus is a boat because both arevehicles. A horse may be defined as a beast that walks on the nails of his middle digits. Whenever we see a horse wesee such a beast, just as whenever we believe a 'truth' we believe something expedient. Messrs. Russell and Hawtrey,if they followed their anti-pragmatist logic, would have to say here that we see that it is such a beast, a fact whichnotoriously no one sees who is not a comparative anatomist.It almost reconciles one to being no logician that one thereby escapes so much abstractionism.

He puts the terms, thus taken in a vacuum, and made into bare logicalentities, through every possible permutation and combination, tortures them on the rack until nothing is left of them,and after all this logical gymnastic, comes out with the following portentous conclusion as what he believes to be 'thecorrect view: that there is no problem at all in truth and falsehood, that some propositions are true and some false, justas some roses are red and some white, that belief is a certain attitude towards propositions, which is called knowledgewhen they are true, error when they are false'—and he seems to think that when once this insight is reached thequestion may be considered closed forever!In spite of my admiration of Mr. Russell's analytic powers, I wish, after reading such an article, that pragmatism, evenhad it no other function, might result in making him and other similarly gifted men ashamed of having used suchpowers in such abstraction from reality. Pragmatism saves us at any rate from such diseased abstractionism as thosepages show.P. S. Since the foregoing rejoinder was written an article on Pragmatism which I believe to be by Mr. Russell hasappeared in the Edinburgh Review for April, 1909. As far as his discussion of the truth-problem goes, altho he hasevidently taken great pains to be fair, it seems to me that he has in no essential respect improved upon his formerarguments.

I can perhaps be briefer if I putwhat I have to say in dialogue form. Let then the anti-pragmatist begin:—Anti-Pragmatist:—You say that the truth of an idea is constituted by its workings. Now suppose a certain state offacts, facts for example of antediluvian planetary history, concerning which the question may be asked: 'Shall thetruth about them ever be known?' And suppose (leaving the hypothesis of an omniscient absolute out of the account)that we assume that the truth is never to be known. I ask you now, brother pragmatist, whether according to you therecan be said to be any truth at all about such a state of facts. Is there a truth, or is there not a truth, in cases where atany rate it never comes to be known?Pragmatist:—Why do you ask me such a question?Anti-Prag.:—Because I think it puts you in a bad dilemma.Prag.:—How so?Anti-Prag.:—Why, because if on the one hand you elect to say that there is a truth, you thereby surrender your wholepragmatist theory. According to that theory, truth requires ideas and workings to constitute it; but in the presentinstance there is supposed to be no knower, and consequently neither ideas nor workings can exist. What then remainsfor you to make your truth of?Prag.:—Do you wish, like so many of my enemies, to force me to make the truth out of the reality itself? I cannot:the truth is something known, thought or said about the reality, and consequently numerically additional to it. Butprobably your intent is something different; so before I say which horn of your dilemma I choose, I ask you to let mehear what the other horn may be.Anti-Prag.:—The other horn is this, that if you elect to"},{"pageNumber":1021,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP970 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 23]Page 970say that there is no truth under the conditions assumed, because there are no ideas or workings, then you fly in the faceof common sense. Does n't common sense believe that every state of facts must in the nature of things be trulystatable in some kind of a proposition, even tho in point of fact the proposition should never be propounded by aliving soul?Prag.:—Unquestionably common sense believes this, and so do I. There have been innumerable events in the historyof our planet of which nobody ever has been or ever will be able to give an account, yet of which it can already besaid abstractly that only one sort of possible account can ever be true. The truth about any such event is thus alreadygenerically predetermined by the event's nature; and one may accordingly say with a perfectly good conscience that itvirtually pre-exists. Common sense is thus right in its instinctive contention.Anti-Prag.:—Is this then the horn of the dilemma which you stand for? Do you say that there is a truth even in caseswhere it shall never be known?Prag.:—Indeed I do, provided you let me hold consistently to my own conception of truth, and do not ask me toabandon it for something which I find impossible to comprehend.—You also believe, do you not, that there is a truth,even in cases where it never shall be known?Anti-Prag.:—I do indeed believe so.Prag.:—Pray then inform me in what, according to you, this truth regarding the unknown consists.Anti-Prag.:—Consists?—pray what do you mean by 'consists'? It consists in nothing but itself, or more properlyspeaking it has neither consistence nor existence, it obtains, it holds.Prag.:—Well, what relation does it bear to the reality of which it holds?Anti-Prag.:—How do you mean, 'what relation'? It holds of it, of course; it knows it, it represents it.Prag.:—Who knows it? What represents it?Anti-Prag.:—The truth does; the truth knows it; or rather not exactly that, but any one knows it who possesses thetruth. Any true idea of the reality represents the truth concerning it.Prag.:—But I thought that we had agreed that no knower of it, nor any idea representing it was to be supposed."},{"pageNumber":1022,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP971 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 24]Page 971Anti-Prag.:—Sure enough!Prag.:—Then I beg you again to tell me in what this truth consists, all by itself, this tertium quid intermediatebetween the facts per se, on the one hand, and all knowledge of them, actual or potential, on the other. What is theshape of it in this third estate? Of what stuff, mental, physical, or 'epistemological,' is it built? What metaphysicalregion of reality does it inhabit?Anti-Prag.:—What absurd questions! Is n't it enough to say that it is true that the facts are so-and-so, and false thatthey are otherwise?Prag.:—'It' is true that the facts are so-and-so—I won't yield to the temptation of asking you what is true; but I do askyou whether your phrase that 'it is true that' the facts are so-and-so really means anything really additional to the barebeing so-and-so of the facts themselves.Anti-Prag.:—It seems to mean more than the bare being of the facts. It is a sort of mental equivalent for them, theirepistemological function, their value in noetic terms.Prag.:—A sort of spiritual double or ghost of them, apparently! If so, may I ask you where this truth is found.Anti-Prag.:—Where? where? There is no 'where'—it simply obtains, absolutely obtains.Prag.:—Not in any one's mind?Anti-Prag.:—No, for we agreed that no actual knower of the truth should be assumed.Prag.:—No actual knower, I agree. But are you sure that no notion of a potential or ideal knower has anything to dowith forming this strangely elusive idea of the truth of the facts in your mind?Anti-Prag.:—Of course if there be a truth concerning the facts, that truth is what the ideal knower would know. Tothat extent you can't keep the notion of it and the notion of him separate. But it is not him first and then it; it is it firstand then him, in my opinion.Prag.:—But you still leave me terribly puzzled as to the status of this so-called truth, hanging as it does betweenearth and heaven, between reality and knowledge, grounded in the reality, yet numerically additional to it, and at thesame time antecedent to any knower's opinion and entirely independent"},{"pageNumber":1023,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP972 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 25]Page 972thereof. Is it as independent of the knower as you suppose? It looks to me terribly dubious, as if it might be onlyanother name for a potential as distinguished from an actual knowledge of the reality. Is n't your truth, after all,simply what any successful knower would have to know in case he existed? And in a universe where no knowerswere even conceivable would any truth about the facts there as something numerically distinguishable from the factsthemselves, find a place to exist in? To me such truth would not only be non-existent, it would be unimaginable,inconceivable.Anti-Prag.:—But I thought you said a while ago that there is a truth of past events, even tho no one shall ever knowit.Prag.:—Yes, but you must remember that I also stipulated for permission to define the word in my own fashion. Thetruth of an event, past, present or future, is for me only another name for the fact that if the event ever does get known,the nature of the knowledge is already to some degree pre-determined. The truth which precedes actual knowledge ofa fact means only what any possible knower of the fact will eventually find himself necessitated to believe about it. Hemust believe something that will bring him into satisfactory relations with it, that will prove a decent mental substitutefor it. What this something may be is of course partly fixed already by the nature of the fact and by the sphere of itsassociations.This seems to me all that you can clearly mean when you say that truth pre-exists to knowledge. It is knowledgeanticipated, knowledge in the form of possibility merely.Anti-Prag.:—But what does the knowledge know when it comes? Does n't it know the truth? And, if so, must n't thetruth be distinct from either the fact or the knowledge?Prag.:—It seems to me that what the knowledge knows is the fact itself, the event, or whatever the reality may be.Where you see three distinct entities in the field, the reality, the knowing, and the truth, I see only two. Moreover, Ican see what each of my two entities is known-as, but when I ask myself what your third entity, the truth, is known-as, I can find nothing distinct from the reality on the one hand, and the ways in which it may be known on the other.Are you not probably misled by common language, which has found"},{"pageNumber":1024,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP973 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 25]Page 973it convenient to introduce a hybrid name, meaning sometimes a kind of knowing and sometimes a reality known, toapply to either of these things interchangeably? And has philosophy anything to gain by perpetuating and consecratingthe ambiguity? If you call the object of knowledge 'reality,' and call the manner of its being cognized 'truth,' cognizedmoreover on particular occasions, and variously, by particular human beings who have their various business with it,and if you hold consistently to this nomenclature, it seems to me that you escape all sorts of trouble.Anti-Prag.:—Do you mean that you think you escape from my dilemma?Prag.:—Assuredly I escape; for if truth and knowledge are terms correlative and interdependent, as I maintain theyare, then wherever knowledge is conceivable truth is conceivable, wherever knowledge is possible truth is possible,wherever knowledge is actual truth is actual. Therefore when you point your first horn at me, I think of truth actual,and say it does n't exist. It does n't; for by hypothesis there is no knower, no ideas, no workings. I agree, however, thattruth possible or virtual might exist, for a knower might possibly be brought to birth; and truth conceivable certainlyexists, for, abstractly taken, there is nothing in the nature of antediluvian events that should make the application ofknowledge to them inconceivable. Therefore when you try to impale me on your second horn, I think of the truth inquestion as a mere abstract possibility, so I say it does exist, and side with common sense.Do not these distinctions rightly relieve me from embarrassment? And don't you think it might help you to make themyourself?Anti-Prag.:—Never!—so avaunt with your abominable hair-splitting and sophistry! Truth is truth; and never will Idegrade it by identifying it with low pragmatic particulars in the way you propose.Prag.:—Well, my dear antagonist, I hardly hoped to convert an eminent intellectualist and logician like you; so enjoy,as long as you live, your own ineffable conception.

Their imagination invents explanations andcombines them. They store up the learning of their time, utter prophecies and warnings, and are regarded as sages.Philosophy, etymologically meaning the love of wisdom, is the work of this class of minds, regarded with anindulgent relish, if not with admiration, even by those who do not understand them or believe much in the truth whichthey proclaim.What philosophy isPhilosophy, thus become a race-heritage, forms in its totality a monstrously unwieldy mass of learning. So taken,there is no reason why any special science like chemistry, or astronomy, should be excluded from it. By commonconsent, however, special sciences are to-day excluded, for reasons presently to be explained; and what remains ismanageable enough to be taught under the name of philosophy by one man if his interests be broad enough.If this were a German textbook I should first give my abstract definition of the topic, thus limited by usage, thenproceed to display its 'Begriff, und Eintheilung,' and its 'Aufgabe und Methode.' But as such displays are usuallyunintelligible to beginners, and unnecessary after reading the book, it will conduce to brevity to omit that chapteraltogether, useful though it might possibly be to more advanced readers as a summary of what is to follow.I will tarry a moment, however, over the matter of definition. Limited by the omission of the special sciences, the"},{"pageNumber":1047,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP986 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 34]Page 986name of philosophy has come more and more to denote ideas of universal scope exclusively. The principles ofexplanation that underlie all things without exception, the elements common to gods and men and animals and stones,the first whence and the last whither of the whole cosmic procession, the conditions of all knowing, and the mostgeneral rules of human action—these furnish the problems commonly deemed philosophic par excellence; and thephilosopher is the man who finds the most to say about them. Philosophy is defined in the usual scholastic textbooksas 'the knowledge of things in general by their ultimate causes, so far as natural reason can attain to such knowledge.'This means that explanation of the universe at large, not description of its details, is what philosophy must aim at; andso it happens that a view of anything is termed philosophic just in proportion as it is broad and connected with otherviews, and as it uses principles not proximate, or intermediate, but ultimate and all-embracing, to justify itself. Anyvery sweeping view of the world is a philosophy in this sense, even though it may be a vague one. It is aWeltanschauung, an intellectualized attitude towards life. Professor Dewey well describes the constitution of all thephilosophies that actually exist, when he says that philosophy expresses a certain attitude, purpose and temper ofconjoined intellect and will, rather than a discipline whose boundaries can be neatly marked off.1Its valueTo know the chief rival attitudes towards life, as the history of human thinking has developed them, and to have heardsome of the reasons they can give for themselves, ought to be considered an essential part of liberal education.Philosophy, indeed, in one sense of the term is only a compendious name for the spirit in education which the word'college' stands for in America. Things can be taught in dry dogmatic ways or in a philosophic way. At a technicalschool a man may grow into a first-rate instrument for doing a certain job, but he may miss all the graciousness ofmind suggested by the term liberal culture. He may remain a cad, and not a gentleman, intellectually pinned down tohis one narrow subject, literal, unable to suppose anything different from1Compare the article 'Philosophy' in Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology."},{"pageNumber":1048,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP987 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 35]Page 987what he has seen, without imagination, atmosphere, or mental perspective.Philosophy, beginning in wonder, as Plato and Aristotle said, is able to fancy everything different from what it is. Itsees the familiar as if it were strange, and the strange as if it were familiar. It can take things up and lay them downagain. Its mind is full of air that plays round every subject. It rouses us from our native dogmatic slumber and breaksup our caked prejudices. Historically it has always been a sort of fecundation of four different human interests,science, poetry, religion, and logic, by one another. It has sought by hard reasoning for results emotionally valuable.To have some contact with it, to catch its influence, is thus good for both literary and scientific students. By its poetryit appeals to literary minds; but its logic it appeals to the scientific; but softens them by its other aspects, and savesthem from too dry a technicality. Both types of student ought to get from philosophy a livelier spirit, more air, moremental background. 'Hast any philosophy in the, Shepherd?'—this question of Touchstone's is the one with whichmen should always meet one another. A man with no philosophy in him is the most inauspicious and unprofitable ofall possible social mates.Its enemies and their objectionsI say nothing in all this of what may be called the gymnastic use of philosophic study, the purely intellectual powergained by defining the high and abstract concepts of the philosopher, and discriminating between them.In spite of the advantages thus enumerated, the study of philosophy has systematic enemies, and they were never asnumerous as at the present day. The definite conquests of science and the apparent indefiniteness of philosophy'sresults partly account for this; to say nothing of man's native rudeness of mind, which maliciously enjoys deridinglong words and abstractions. 'Scholastic jargon,' 'mediæval dialectics,' are for many people synonyms of the wordphilosophy. With his obscure and uncertain speculations as to the intimate nature and causes of things, the philosopheris likened to a 'blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that is not there.' His occupation"},{"pageNumber":1049,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP988 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 36]Page 988is described as the art of 'endlessly disputing without coming to any conclusion,' or more contemptuously still as the'systematische Missbrauch einer eben zu diesem Zwecke erfundenen Terminologie.'Only to a very limited degree is this sort of hostility reasonable. I will take up some of the current objections insuccessive order, since to reply to them will be a convenient way of entering into the interior of our subject.Objection that it is unpractical answeredObjection I. Whereas the sciences make steady progress and yield applications of matchless utility, philosophy makesno progress and has no practical applications.Reply. The opposition is unjustly founded, for the sciences are themselves branches of the tree of philosophy. As fastas questions got accurately answered, the answers were called 'scientific,' and what men call 'philosophy' to-day is butthe residuum of questions still unanswered. At this very moment we are seeing two sciences, psychology and generalbiology, drop off from the parent trunk and take independent root as specialties. The more general philosophy cannotas a rule follow the voluminous details of any special science.This objection in the light of historyA backward glance at the evolution of philosophy will reward us here. The earliest philosophers in every land wereencylopædic sages, lovers of wisdom, sometimes with, and sometimes without a dominantly ethical or religiousinterest. They were just men curious beyond immediate practical needs, and no particular problems, but rather theproblematic generally, was their specialty. China, Persia, Egypt, India, had such wise men, but those of Greece are theonly sages who until very recently have influenced the course of western thinking. The earlier Greek philosophylasted, roughly speaking, for about two hundred and fifty years, say from 600 B. C. onwards. Such men as Thales,Heracleitus, Pythagoras, Parmenides, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, were mathematicians, theologians,politicians, astronomers, and physicists. All the learning of their time, such as it was, was at their disposal. Plato andAristotle continued their tradition, and the great mediæval philosophers only enlarged its field of application. If weturn to Saint"},{"pageNumber":1050,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP989 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 36]Page 989Thomas Aquinas's great 'Summa,' written in the thirteenth century, we find opinions expressed about literallyeverything, from God down to matter, with angels, men, and demons taken in on the way. The relations of almosteverything with everything else, of the creator with his creatures, of the knower with the known, of substances withforms, of mind with body, of sin with salvation, come successively up for treatment. A theology, a psychology, asystem of duties and morals, are given in fullest detail, while physics and logic are established in their universalprinciples. The impression made on the reader is of almost superhuman intellectual resources. It is true that SaintThomas's method of handling the mass of fact, or supposed fact, which he treated, was different from that to which weare accustomed. He deduced and proved everything, either from fixed principles of reason, or from holy Scripture.The properties and changes of bodies, for example, were explained by the two principles of matter and form, asAristotle had taught. Matter was the quantitative, determinable, passive element; form, the qualitative, unifying,determining, and active principle. All activity was for an end. Things could act on each other only when in contact.The number of species of things was determinate, and their differences discrete, etc., etc.1By the beginning of the seventeenth century, men were tired of the elaborate a priori methods of scholasticism.Suarez's treatises availed not to keep them in fashion. But the new philosophy of Descartes, which displaced thescholastic teaching, sweeping over Europe like wildfire, preserved the same encyclopædic character. We think ofDescartes nowadays as the metaphysician who said 'Cogito, ergo sum,' separated mind from matter as two contrastedsubstances, and gave a renovated proof of God's existence. But his contemporaries thought of him much more as wethink of Herbert Spencer in our day, as a great cosmic evolutionist, who explained, by 'the redistribution of matter andmotion,' and the laws of impact, the rotations of the heavens, the circulation of the1J.Rickaby's General Metaphysics (Longmans, Green and Co.) gives a popular account of the essentials of St. Thomas's philosophy ofnature.

With Locke's 'Essay Concerning Human Understanding,' published in 1690, philosophy forthe first time turned more exclusively to the problem of knowledge, and became 'critical.' This subjective tendencydeveloped; and although the school of Leibnitz, who was the pattern of a universal sage, still kept up the moreuniversal tradition—Leibnitz's follower Wolff published systematic treatises on everything, physical as well as moral—Hume, who succeeded Locke, woke Kant 'from his dogmatic slumber,' and since Kant's time the word 'philosophy'has come to stand for mental and moral speculations for more than for physical theories. Until a comparatively recenttime, philosophy was taught in our colleges under the name of'mental and moral philosophy,' or 'philosophy of thehuman mind,' exclusively, to distinguish it from 'natural philosophy.'But the older tradition is the better as well as the completer one. To know the actual peculiarities of the world we areborn into is surely as important as to know what makes worlds anyhow abstractly possible. Yet this latter knowledgehas been treated by many since Kant's time as the only knowledge worthy of being called philosophical. Commonmen feel the question 'What is Nature like?' to be as meritorious as the Kantian question 'How is Nature possible?' Sophilosophy, in order not to lose human respect, must take some notice of the actual constitution of reality. There aresigns to-day of a return to the more objective tradition.1Philosophy is only 'man thinking'Philosophy in the full sense is only man thinking, thinking about generalities rather than about particulars. Butwhether about generalities or particulars, man thinks always by the same methods. He observes, discriminates,generalizes, classifies, looks for causes, traces analogies, and makes hypotheses. Philosophy, taken as somethingdistinct from science or from practical affairs, follows no method pecular to itself. All our thinking to-day has evolvedgradually out of primitive human thought, and the only really1For an excellent defence of it I refer my readers to Paulsen's Introduction to Philosophy, translated by Thilly (1895), pp. 19 44."},{"pageNumber":1052,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP991 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 37]Page 991important changes that have come over its manner (as distinguished from the matters in which it believes) are agreater hesitancy in asserting its convictions, and the habit of seeking verfication1 for them whenever it can.It will be instructive to trace very briefly the origins of our present habits of thought.Origin of man's present ways of thinkingAuguste Comte, the founder of a philosophy which he called 'positive,'2 said that human theory on any subject alwaystook three forms in succession. In the theological stage of theorizing, phenomena are explained by spirits producingthem; in the meta-physical stage, their essential feature is made into an abstract idea, and this is placed behind them asif it were an explanation; in the positive stage, phenomena are simply described as to their coexistences andsuccessions. Their 'laws' are formulated, but no explanation of their natures or existence is sought after. Thus a'spiritus rector' would be a theological,—a 'principal of attraction' a metaphysical,—and a 'law of the squares' wouldbe a positive theory of the planetary movements.Comte's account is too sharp and definite. Anthropology shows that the earliest attempts at human theorizing mixedthe theological and metaphysical together. Common things needed no special explanation, remarkable things alone,odd things, especially deaths, calamities, diseases, called for it. What made things act was the mysterious energy inthem, and the more awful they were, the more of this mana they possessed. The great thing was to acquire manaoneself. 'Sympathetic magic' is the collective name for what seems to have been the primitive philosophy here. Youcould act on anything by controlling anything else that either was associated with it or resembled it. If you wished toinjure an enemy, you should either make an image of him, or get some of his hair or other belongings, or get his namewritten. Injuring the substitute, you thus made him suffer correspondingly. If you wished the rain to come, yousprinkled the ground, if the wind, you whistled, etc. If you would have yams grow well in your garden, put a stonethere that looks like a yam. Would1Compare G. H. Lewes: Aristotle (1864), chap. 4.2Cours de philosophie positive, 6 volumes, Paris, 1830 1842."},{"pageNumber":1053,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP992 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 38]Page 992you cure jaundice, give turmeric, that makes things look yellow; or give poppies for troubles of the head, because theirseed vessels form a 'head.' This 'doctrine of signatures' played a great part in early medicine. The various '-mancies'and '-mantics' come in here, in which witchcraft and incipient science are indistinguishably mixed. 'Sympathetic'theorizing persists to the present day. 'Thoughts are things,' for a contemporary school—and on the whole a goodschool—of practical philosophy. Cultivate the thought of what you desire, affirm it, and it will bring all similarthoughts from elsewhere to reinforce it, so that finally your wish will be fulfilled.1Little by little, more positive ways of considering things began to prevail. Common elements in phenomena began tobe singled out and to form the basis of generalizations. But these elements at first had necessarily to be the moredramatic or humanly interesting ones. The hot, the cold, the wet, the dry in things explained their behavior. Somebodies were naturally warm, others cold. Motions were natural or violent. The heavens moved in circles becausecircular motion was the most perfect. The lever was explained by the greater quantity of perfection embodied in themovement of its longer arm.2 The sun went south in winter to escape the cold. Precious or beautiful things hadexceptional properties. Peacock's flesh resisted putrefaction. The lodestone would drop the iron which it held if thesuperiorly powerful diamond was brought near, etc.Such ideas sound to us grotesque, but imagine no tracks made for us by scientific ancestors, and what aspects wouldwe single out from nature to understand things by? Not till the beginning of the seventeenth century did the moreinsipid kinds of regularity in things abstract men's attention away from the properties originally picked out. Few of usrealize1Compare Prentice Mulford and others of the 'new thought' type. For primitive sympathetic magic consult J. Jastrow in Fact and Fablein Psychology, the chapter on Analogy; F. B.

Three hundred and fifty years ago hardly any onebelieved in the Copernican planetary theory. Optical combinations were not discovered. The circulation of the blood,the weight of air, the conduction of heat, the laws of motion were unknown; the common pump was inexplicable;there were no clocks; no thermometers; no general gravitation; the world was five thousand years old; spirits movedthe planets; alchemy, magic, astrology, imposed on every one's belief. Modern science began only after 1600, withKepler, Galileo, Descartes, Torricelli, Pascal, Harvey, Newton, Huygens, and Boyle. Five men telling one another insuccession the discoveries which their lives had witnessed, could deliver the whole of it into our hands: Harvey mighthave told Newton, who might have told Voltaire; Voltaire might have told Dalton, who might have told Huxley, whomight have told the readers of this book.Science is specialized philosophyThe men who began this work of emancipation were philosophers in the original sense of the word, universal sages.Galileo said that he had spent more years on philosophy than months on mathematics. Descartes was a universalphilosopher in the fullest sense of the term. But the fertility of the newer conceptions made special departments oftruth grow at such a rate that they became too unwieldy with details for the more universal minds to carry them, so thespecial sciences of mechanics, astronomy, and physics began to drop off from the parent stem.No one could have foreseen in advance the extraordinary fertility of the more insipid mathematical aspects whichthese geniuses ferreted out. No one could have dreamed of the control over nature which the search for theirconcomitant variations would give. 'Laws' describe these variations; and all our present laws of nature have as theirmodel the proportionality of v to t, and of s to t2 which Galileo first laid bare. Pascal's discovery of the proportionalityof altitude to barometric height, Newton's of acceleration to distance, Boyle's of air-volume to pressure, Descartes' ofsine to sine in the refracted ray, were the first fruits of Galileo's discovery. There was no question of agencies, nothinganimistic or sympathetic in this new way of taking nature. It was description only, of con-"},{"pageNumber":1055,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP994 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 39]Page 994comitant variations, after the particular quantities that varied had been successfully abstracted out. The result soonshowed itself in a differentiation of human knowledge into two spheres, one called 'Science,' within which the moredefinite laws apply, the other 'General Philosophy,' in which they do not. The state of mind called positivistic is theresult. 'Down with philosophy!' is the cry of innumerable scientific minds. 'Give us measurable facts only, phenomena,without the mind's additions, without entities or principles that pretend to explain.' It is largely from this kind of mindthat the objection that philosophy has made no progress, proceeds.Philosophy is the residuum of problems unsolved by scienceIt is obvious enough that if every step forward which philosophy makes, every question to which an accurate answeris found, gets accredited to science the residuum of unanswered problems will alone remain to constitute the domainof philosophy, and will alone bear her name. In point of fact this is just what is happening. Philosophy has become acollective name for questions that have not yet been answered to the satisfaction of all by whom they have been asked.It does not follow, because some of these questions have waited two thousand years for an answer, that no answer willever be forthcoming. Two thousand years probably measure but one paragraph in that great romance of adventurecalled the history of the intellect of man. The extraordinary progress of the last three hundred years is due to a rathersudden finding of the way in which a certain order of questions ought to be attacked, questions admitting ofmathematical treatment. But to assume therefore, that the only possible philosophy must be mechanical andmathematical, and to disparage all enquiry into the other sorts of question, is to forget the extreme diversity of aspectsunder which reality undoubtedly exists. To the spiritual questions the proper avenues of philosophic approach will alsoundoubtedly be found. They have, to some extent, been found already. In some respects, indeed, 'science' has madeless progress than 'philosophy'—its most general conceptions would astonish neither Aristotle nor Descartes, couldthey revisit our earth. The composition of things from elements, their evolution, the conservation of energy, the ideaof a universal determinism, would seem to them common-"},{"pageNumber":1056,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP995 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 40]Page 995place enough—the little things, the microscopes, electric lights, telephones, and details of the sciences, would be tothem the awe-inspiring things. But if they opened our books on metaphysics, or visited a philosophic lecture room,everything would sound strange. The whole idealistic or 'critical' attitude of our time would be novel, and it would belong before they took it in.1Objection 2. Philosophy is dogmatic, and pretends to settle things by pure reason, whereas the only fruitful mode ofgetting at truth is to appeal to concrete experience. Science collects, classes, and analyzes facts, and thereby faroutstrips philosophy.Philosophy need not be dogmaticReply. This objection is historically valid. Too many philosophers have aimed at closed systems, established a priori,claiming infallibility, and to be accepted or rejected only as totals. The sciences on the other hand, using hypothesesonly, but always seeking to verify them by experiment and observation, open a way for indefinite self-correction andincrease. At the present day, it is getting more and more difficult for dogmatists claiming finality for their systems, toget a hearing in educated circles. Hypothesis and verification, the watchwords of science, have set the fashion toostrongly in academic minds.Since philosophers are only men thinking about things in the most comprehensive possible way, they can use anymethod whatsoever freely. Philosophy must, in any case, complete the sciences, and must incorporate their methods.One cannot see why, if such a policy should appear advisable, philosophy might not end by forswearing alldogmatism whatever, and become as hypothetical in her manners as the most empirical science of them all.Objection 3. Philosophy is out of touch with real life, for which it substitutes abstractions. The real world is various,tangled, painful. Philosophers have, almost without exception, treated it as noble, simple, and perfect, ignoring thecomplexity of fact, and indulging in a sort of optimism that exposes their systems to the contempt of common men,and1The reader will find all that I have said, and much more, set forth in an excellent article by James Ward in Mind, vol. 15, no. lviii: 'TheProgress of Philosophy.'"},{"pageNumber":1057,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP996 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 40]Page 996to the satire of such writers as Voltaire and Schopenhauer. The great popular success of Schopenhauer is due to thefact that, first among philosophers, he spoke the concrete truth about the ills of life.Nor is it divorced from realityReply. This objection also is historically valid, but no reason appears why philosophy should keep aloof from realitypermanently. Her manners may change as she successfully develops. The thin and noble abstractions may give way tomore solid and real constructions, when the materials and methods for making such constructions shall be more andmore securely ascertained. In the end philosophers may get into as close contact as realistic novelists with the facts oflife.Philosophy as metaphysicsIn conclusion. In its original acceptation, meaning the completest knowledge of the universe, philosophy must includethe results of all the sciences, and cannot be contrasted with the latter. It simply aims at making of science whatHerbert Spencer calls a 'system of completely unified knowledge.'1 In the more modern sense, of something contrastedwith the sciences, philosophy means 'metaphysics.' The older sense is the more worthy sense, and as the results of thesciences get more available for co-ordination, and the conditions for finding truth in different kinds of question getmore methodically defined, we may hope that the term will revert to its original meaning. Science, metaphysics, andreligion may then again form a single body of wisdom, and lend each other mutual support.At present this hope is far from its fulfillment. I propose in this book to take philosophy in the narrow sense ofmetaphysics, and to let both religion and the results of the sciences alone.1See the excellent chapter in Spencer's First Principles, entitled: 'Philosophy Defined.'"},{"pageNumber":1058,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP997 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 41]Page 997Chapter IIThe Problems of MetaphysicsExamples of metaphysical problemsNo exact definition of the term 'metaphysics' is possible, and to name some of the problems it treats of is the best wayof getting at the meaning of the word. It means the discussion of various obscure, abstract, and universal questionswhich the sciences and life in general suggest but do not solve; questions left over, as it were; questions, all of themvery broad and deep, and relating to the whole of things, or to the ultimate elements thereof. Instead of a definition letme cite a few examples, in a random order, of such questions:—What are 'thoughts,' and what are 'things'? and how are they connected?What do we mean when we say 'truth'?Is there a common stuff out of which all facts are made?How comes there to be a world at all? and, Might it as well not have been?Which is the most real kind of reality?What binds all things into one universe?Is unity or diversity more fundamental?Have all things one origin? or many?Is everything predestined, or are some things (our wills for example) free?Is the world infinite or finite in amount?Are its parts continuous, or are there vacua?What is God?—or the gods?How are mind and body joined? Do they act on each other?How does anything act on anything else?How can one thing change or grow out of another thing?Are space and time beings?—or what?In knowledge, how does the object get into the mind?—or the mind get at the object?We know by means of universal notions. Are these also real? Or are only particular things real?What is meant by a 'thing'?"},{"pageNumber":1059,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP998 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 42]Page 998'Principles of reason,'—are they inborn or derived?Are 'beauty' and 'good' matters of opinion only? Or have they objective validity? And, if so, what does the phrasemean?Such are specimens of the kind of question termed metaphysical. Kant said that the three essential metaphysicalquestions were:—What can I know?What should I do?What may I hope?Metaphysics definedA glance at all such questions suffices to rule out such a definition of metaphysics as that of Christian Wolff, whocalled it 'the science of what is possible,' as distinguished from that of what is actual, for most of the questions relateto what is actual fact. One may say that metaphysics inquires into the cause, the substance, the meaning, and theoutcome of all things. Or one may call it the science of the most universal principles of reality (whether experiencedby us or not), in their connection with one another and with our powers of knowledge. 'Principles' here may meaneither entities, like 'atoms,' 'souls,' or logical laws like: 'A thing must either exist or not exist'; or generalized facts, like'things can act only after they exist.' But the principles are so numerous, and the 'science' of them is so far fromcompletion, that such definitions have only a decorative value. The serious work of metaphysics is done over theseparate single questions. If these should get cleared up, talk of metaphysics as a unified science might properlybegin. This book proposes to handle only a few separate problems, leaving others untouched.Nature of metaphysical problemsThese problems are for the most part real; that is, but few of them result from a misuse of terms in stating them.'Things,' for example, are or are not composed of one stuff; they either have or have not a single origin; they eitherare or are not completely predetermined, etc. Such alternatives may indeed be impossible of decision; but until this isconclusively proved of them, they confront us legitimately, and some one must take charge of them and keep accountof the solutions that are proposed, even if he does not himself add new ones. The opinions of"},{"pageNumber":1060,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP999 hl[01 03 2011 21 17 42]Page 999the learned regarding them must, in short, be classified and responsibly discussed. For instance, how many opinionsare possible as to the origin of the world? Spencer says that the world must have been either eternal, or self-created,or created by an outside power. So for him there are only three. Is this correct? If so, which of the three views seemsthe most reasonable? and why? In a moment we are in the thick of metaphysics. We have to be metaphysicians evento decide with Spencer that neither mode of origin is thinkable and that the whole problem is unreal.Some hypotheses may be absurd on their face, because they are self-contradictory. If, for example, infinity means'what can never be completed by successive syntheses,' the notion of anything made by the successive addition ofinfinitely numerous parts, and yet completed, is absurd. Other hypotheses, for example that everything in naturecontributes to a single supreme purpose, may be insusceptible either of proof or of disproof. Other hypotheses again,for instance that vacua exist, may be susceptible of probable solution. The classing of the hypotheses is thus asnecessary as the classing of the problems, and both must be recognized as constituting a serious branch of learning.1There must in short be metaphysicians. Let us for a while become metaphysicians ourselves.Rationalism and empiricism in metaphysicsAs we survey the history of metaphysics we soon realize that two pretty distinct types of mind have filled it with theirwarfare. Let us call them the rationalist and the empiricist types of mind. A saying of Coleridge's is often quoted, tothe effect that every one is born either a platonist or an aristotelian. By aristotelian, he means empiricist, and byplatonist, he means rationalist; but although the contrast between the two Greek philosophers exists in the sense inwhich Coleridge meant it, both of them were rationalists as compared with the kind of empiricism which Democritusand Protagoras developed; and Coleridge had better have taken either of those names instead of Aristotle as hisempiricist example.Rationalists are the men of principles, empiricists the men1Consult here Paul Janet: Principes de Métaphysique, etc., 1897, leçons 1, 2."},{"pageNumber":1061,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1000 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 14]Page 1000of facts; but, since principles are universals, and facts are particulars, perhaps the best way of characterizing the twotendencies is to say that rationalist thinking proceeds most willingly by going from wholes to parts, while empiricistthinking proceeds by going from parts to wholes. Plato, the archrationalist, explained the details of nature by theirparticipation in 'ideas,' which all depended on the supreme idea of the 'good.' Protagoras and Democritus wereempiricists. The latter explained the whole cosmos, including gods as well as men, and thoughts as well as things, bytheir composition out of atomic elements; Protagoras explained truth, which for Plato was the absolute system of theideas, as a collective name for men's opinions.Rationalists prefer to deduce facts from principles. Empiricists prefer to explain principles as inductions from facts. Isthought for the sake of life? or is life for the sake of thought? Empiricism inclines to the former, rationalism to thelatter branch of the alternative. God's life, according to Aristotle and Hegel, is pure theory. The mood of admiration isnatural to rationalism. Its theories are usually optimistic, supplementing the experienced world by clean and pure idealconstructions. Aristotle and Plato, the Scholastics, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Kant, and Hegel are examples of this.They claimed absolute finality for their systems, in the noble architecture of which, as their authors believed, truthwas eternally embalmed. This temper of finality is foreign to empiricist minds. They may be dogmatic about theirmethod of building on 'hard facts,' but they are willing to be sceptical about any conclusions reached by the method ata given time. They aim at accuracy of detail rather than at completeness; are contented to be fragmentary; are lessinspiring than the rationalists, often treating the high as a case of 'nothing but' the low ('nothing but' self-interest wellunderstood, etc.), but they usually keep more in touch with actual life, are less subjective, and their spirit is obviouslymore 'scientific' in the hackneyed sense of that term. Socrates, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, the Mills, F. A. Lange, J.Dewey, F. C. S. Schiller, Bergson, and other contemporaries are specimens of this type. Of course we find mixedminds in abundance, and few philosophers are typical in either class. Kant may fairly be called mixed.

The author of this volume is weakly endowed on the rationalist side, and his book will show astrong leaning towards empiricism. The clash of the two ways of looking at things will be emphasized throughout thevolume.1I will now enter the interior of the subject by discussing special problems as examples of metaphysical inquiry; and inorder not to conceal any of the skeletons in the philosophic closet, I will start with the worst problem possible, thesocalled 'ontological problem,' or question of how there comes to be anything at all.1Compare W. James: 'The Sentiment of Rationality,' in The Will to Believe (Longmans, Green and Co., 1899), p. 63 f.; Pragmatism(ibid.), chap. i; A Pluralistic Universe (ibid.), chap. i."},{"pageNumber":1063,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1002 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 15]Page 1002Chapter IIIThe Problem of BeingSchopenhauer on the origin of the problemHow comes the world to be here at all instead of the nonentity which might be imagined in its place? Schopenhauer'sremarks on this question may be considered classical. 'Apart from man,' he says, 'no being wonders at its ownexistence. When man first becomes conscious, he takes himself for granted, as something needing no explanation. Butnot for long; for, with the rise of the first reflection, that wonder begins which is the mother of metaphysics, andwhich made Aristotle say that men now and always seek to philosophize because of wonder— The lower a man standsin intellectual respects the less of a riddle does existence seem to him but, the clearer his consciousness becomes themore the problem grasps him in its greatness. In fact the unrest which keeps the never stopping clock of metaphysicsgoing is the thought that the non-existence of this world is just as possible as its existence. Nay more, we soonconceive the world as something the non-existence of which not only is conceivable but would indeed be preferable toits existence; so that our wonder passes easily into a brooding over that fatality which nevertheless could call such aworld into being, and mislead the immense force that could produce and preserve it into an activity so hostile to itsown interests. The philosophic wonder thus becomes a sad astonishment, and like the overture to Don Giovanni,philosophy begins with a minor chord.'1One need only shut oneself in a closet and begin to think of the fact of one's being there, of one's queer bodily shapein the darkness (a thing to make children scream at, as Stevenson says), of one's fantastic character and all, to have thewonder steal over the detail as much as over the general fact of being, and to see that it is only familiarity that bluntsit. Not only that anything should be, but that this very thing1The World as Will and Representation: Appendix 17, 'On the metaphysical need of man,' abridged."},{"pageNumber":1064,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1003 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 16]Page 1003should be, is mysterious! Philosophy stares, but brings no reasoned solution, for from nothing to being there is nological bridge.Various treatments of the problemAttempts are sometimes made to banish the question rather than to give it an answer. Those who ask it, we are told,extend illegitimately to the whole of being the contrast to a supposed alternative non-being which only particularbeings possess. These, indeed, were not, and now are. But being in general, or in some shape, always was, and youcannot rightly bring the whole of it into relation with a primordial nonentity. Whether as God or as material atoms, itis itself primal and eternal. But if you call any being whatever eternal, some philosophers have always been ready totaunt you with the paradox inherent in the assumption. Is past eternity completed? they ask: If so, they go on, it musthave had a beginning; for whether your imagination traverses it forwards or backwards, it offers an identical contentor stuff to be measured; and if the amount comes to an end in one way, it ought to come to an end in the other. Inother words, since we now witness its end, some past moment must have witnessed its beginning. If, however, it had abeginning, when was that, and why?You are up against the previous nothing, and do not see how it ever passed into being. This dilemma, of having tochoose between a regress which, although called infinite, has nevertheless come to a termination, and an absolutefirst, has played a great part in philosophy's history.Other attempts still are made at exorcising the question. Non-being is not, said Parmenides and Zeno; only being is.Hence what is, is necessarily being—being, in short, is necessary. Others, calling the idea of nonentity no real idea,have said that on the absence of an idea can no genuine problem be founded. More curtly still, the whole ontologicalwonder has been called diseased, a case of Grübelsucht like asking, 'Why am I myself?' or 'Why is a triangle atriangle?'Rationalistic minds here and there have sought to reduce the mystery. Some forms of being have been deemed morenatural, so to say, or more inevitable and necessary than"},{"pageNumber":1065,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1004 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 17]Page 1004others. Empiricists of the evolutionary type—Herbert Spencer seems a good example—have assumed that whateverhad the least of reality, was weakest, faintest, most imperceptible, most nascent, might come easiest first, and be theearliest successor to nonentity. Little by little the fuller grades of being might have added themselves in the samegradual way until the whole universe grew up.Rationalist and empiricist treatmentsTo others not the minimum, but the maximum of being has seemed the earliest First for the intellect to accept. 'Theperfection of a thing does not keep it from existing,' Spinoza said, 'on the contrary, it founds its existence.'1 It is mereprejudice to assume that it is harder for the great than for the little to be, and that easiest of all it is to be nothing. Whatmakes things difficult in any line is the alien obstructions that are met with, and the smaller and weaker the thing themore powerful over it these become. Some things are so great and inclusive that to be is implied in their very nature.The anselmian or ontological proof of God's existence, sometimes called the cartesian proof, criticised by SaintThomas, rejected by Kant, re-defended by Hegel, follows this line of thought. What is conceived as imperfect maylack being among its other lacks, but if God, who is expressly defined as Ens perfectissimum, lacked anythingwhatever, he would contradict his own definition. He cannot lack being therefore: He is Ens necessarium, Ensrealissimum, as well as Ens perfectissimum.2Hegel in his lordly way says: 'It would be strange if God were not rich enough to embrace so poor a category asBeing, the poorest and most abstract of all.' This is somewhat in line with Kant's saying that a real dollar does notcontain one cent more than an imaginary dollar. At the beginning of his logic Hegel seeks in another way to mediatenonentity with being. Since 'being' in the abstract, mere being, means nothing in particular, it is indistinguishable from'nothing'; and he seems dimly to think that this constitutes an identity between the two notions, of which some usemay be made in getting from one to the other. Other still queerer attempts show well the1Ethics, part i, prop. xi, scholium.2St. Anselm: Proslogium, etc. Translated by Deane: Chicago, 1903; Descarte: Meditations, p. 5; Kant: Critique of Pure Reason,Transcendental Dialectic, 'On the impossibility of an ontological proof, etc.'"},{"pageNumber":1066,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1005 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 17]Page 1005rationalist temper. Mathematically you can deduce 1 from 0 by the following process: Or physically if allbeing has (as it seems to have) a 'polar' construction, so that every positive part of it has its negative, we get thesimple equation: +1 -1 = 0, plus and minus being the signs of polarity in physics.The same amount of existence must be begged by allIt is not probable that the reader will be satisfied with any of these solutions, and contemporary philosophers, evenrationalistically minded ones, have on the whole agreed that no one has intelligibly banished the mystery of fact.Whether the original nothing burst into God and vanished, as night vanishes in day, while God thereupon became thecreative principle of all lesser beings; or whether all things have foisted or shaped themselves imperceptibly intoexistence, the same amount of existence has in the end to be assumed and begged by the philosopher. To comminutethe difficulty is not to quench it. If you are a rationalist you beg a kilogram of being at once, we will say; if you are anempiricist you beg a thousand successive grams; but you beg the same amount in each case, and you are the samebeggar whatever you may pretend. You leave the logical riddle untouched, of how the coming of whatever is, came itall at once, or came it piecemeal, can be intellectually understood.1Conservation vs. creationIf being gradually grew, its quantity was of course not always the same, and may not be the same hereafter. To mostphilosophers this view has seemed absurd, neither God, nor primordial matter, nor energy being supposed to admit ofincrease or decrease. The orthodox opinion is that the quantity of reality must at all costs be conserved, and thewaxing and waning of our phenomenal experiences must be treated as surface appearances which leave the deepsuntouched.Nevertheless, within experience, phenomena come and go. There are novelties; there are losses. The world seems, onthe concrete and proximate level at least, really to grow. So the1In more technical language, one may say that fact or being is 'contingent,' or matter of 'chance,' so far as our intellect is concerned.

By inertia? By perpetualcreation? Do the new ones come at the call of the old ones? Why do not they all go out like a candle?Who can tell off-hand? The question of being is the darkest in all philosophy. All of us are beggars here, and noschool can speak disdainfully of another or give itself superior airs.

'Things'are known to us by our senses, and are called 'presentations' by some authors, to distinguish them from the ideas or'representations' which we may have when our senses are closed. I myself have grown accustomed to the words'percept' and 'concept' in treating of the contrast, but concepts flow out of percepts and into them again, they are sointerlaced, and our life rests on them so inter-changeably and undiscriminatingly, that it is often difficult to impartquickly to beginners a clear notion of the difference meant. Sensation and thought in man are mingled, but they varyindependently. In our quadrupedal relatives thought proper is at a minimum, but we have no reason to suppose thattheir immediate life of feeling is either less or more copious than ours. Feeling must have been originally self-sufficing; and thought appears as a superadded function, adapting us to a wider environment than that of which brutestake account. Some parts of the stream of feeling must be more intense, emphatic, and exciting than others in animalsas well as in ourselves; but whereas lower animals simply react upon these more salient sensations by appropriatemovements, higher animals remember them, and men react on them intellectually, by using nouns, adjectives, andverbs to identify them when they meet them elsewhere.The great difference between percepts and concepts1 is that percepts are continuous and concepts are discrete. Notdiscrete in their being, for conception as an act is part of the flux of feeling, but discrete from each other in theirseveral meanings. Each concept means just what it singly means, and1In what follows I shall freely use synonyms for these two terms. 'Idea,' 'thought,' and 'intellection' are synonymous with 'concept.'Instead of 'percept' I shall often speak of 'sensation,' 'feeling,' 'intuition,' and sometimes of 'sensible experience' or of the 'immediate flow'of conscious life. Since Hegel's time what is simply perceived has been called the 'immediate flow' of conscious life. Since Hegel's timewhat is simply perceived has been called while the 'mediated,' is synonymous with what is conceived."},{"pageNumber":1069,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1008 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 19]Page 1008nothing else; and if the conceiver does not know whether he means this or means that, it shows that his concept isimperfectly formed. The perceptual flux as such, on the contrary, means nothing, and is but what it immediately is. Nomatter how small a tract of it be taken, it is always a much-at-once, and contains innumerable aspects and characterswhich conception can pick out, isolate, and thereafter always intend. It shows duration, intensity, complexity orsimplicity, interestingness, excitingness, pleasantness or their opposites. Data from all our senses enter into it, mergedin a general extensiveness of which each occupies a big or little share. Yet all these parts leave its unity unbroken. Itsboundaries are no more distinct than are those of the field of vision. Boundaries are things that intervene; but herenothing intervenes save parts of the perceptual flux itself, and these are overflowed by what they separate, so thatwhatever we distinguish and isolate conceptually is found perceptually to telescope and compenetrate and diffuse intoits neighbors. The cuts we make are purely ideal. If my reader can succeed in abstracting from all conceptualinterpretation and lapse back into his immediate sensible life at this very moment, he will find it to be what someonehas called a big blooming buzzing confusion, as free from contradiction in its 'much-at-onceness' as it is all alive andevidently there.1The conceptual orderOut of this aboriginal sensible much ness attention carves out objects, which conception then names and identifiesforever—in the sky 'constellations,' on the earth 'beach,' 'sea,' 'cliff,' 'bushes,' 'grass.' Out of time we cut 'days' and'nights,' 'summers' and 'winters.' We say what each part of the sensible continuum is, and all these abstracted what areconcepts.2The intellectual life of man consists almost wholly in his substitution of a conceptual order for the perceptual order inwhich his1Compare W. James: A Pluralistic Universe, pp. 758 761. Also Psychology, Briefer Course, pp. 157 166.2On the function of conception consult: Sir William Hamilton's Lectures on Logic, 9, 10; H. L.

But before tracing the consequences of the substitution, I must say something about theconceptual order itself.1Trains of concepts unmixed with percepts grow frequent in the adult mind; and parts of these conceptual trains arrestour attention just as parts of the perceptual flow did, giving rise to concepts of a higher order of abstractness. Sosubtile is the discernment of man, and so great the power of some men to single out the most fugitive elements ofwhat passes before them, that these new formations have no limit. Aspect within aspect, quality after quality, relationupon relation, absences and negations as well as present features, end by being noted and their names added to thestore of nouns, verbs, adjectives, conjunctions, and prepositions by which the human mind interprets life. Every newbook verbalizes some new concept, which becomes important in proportion to the use that can be made of it. Differentuniverses of thought thus arise, with specific sorts of relation among their ingredients. The world of common-sense'things'; the world of material tasks to be done; the mathematical world of pure forms; the world of ethicalpropositions; the worlds of logic, of music, etc., all abstracted and generalized from long forgotten perceptual in-(Footnote continued from previous page)Evolution in Man, chaps. iii, iv; Th. Ribot: l'Evolution des Idées Générales, chap. vi; Th. Ruyssen, Essai sur l'Evolution psychologiquedu Judgement, chap. vii; Laromiguière, Lecons de Philosophie, part 2, lesson 12. The account I give directly contradicts that which Kantgave which has prevailed since Kant's time. Kant always speaks of the aboriginal sensible flux as a 'manifold' of which he considers theessential character to be its disconnectedness. To get any togetherness at all into it requires, he thinks, the agency of the 'transcendentalego of apperception,' and to get any definite connections requires the agency of the understanding, with its synthetizing concepts or'categories.' 'Die Verbindung (conjunctio) eines Mannigfaltigen kann überhaupt niemals durch Sinne in uns kommen, und kann also auchnicht in der reinen Form der sinnlichen Anschauung zugleich mit enthalten sein; denn sie ist ein Actus von der Sinnlichkeit, Verstandnennen muss, so ist alle Verbindung eine Verstandeshandlung.' K. d. r. V., 2te, Aufg., pp. 129 130. The reader must decide whichaccount agrees best with his own actual experience.1The substitution was first described in these terms by S. H. Hodgson in his Philosophy of Reflection, i, 288 310."},{"pageNumber":1071,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1010 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 20]Page 1010stances, from which they have as it were flowered out, return and merge themselves again in the particulars of ourpresent and future perception. By those whats we apperceive all our thises. Percepts and concepts interpenetrate andmelt together, impregnate and fertilize each other. Neither, taken alone, knows reality in its completeness. We needthem both, as we need both our legs to walk with.From Aristotle downwards philosophers have frankly admitted the indispensability, for complete knowledge of fact, ofboth the sensational and the intellectual contribution. 1 For complete knowledge of fact, I say; but facts are particularsand connect themselves with practical necessities and the arts; and Greek philosophers soon formed the notion that aknowledge of so-called 'universals,' consisting of concepts of abstract forms, qualities, numbers, and relations was theonly knowledge worthy of the truly philosophic mind. Particular facts decay and our perceptions of them vary. Aconcept never varies; and between such unvarying terms the relations must be constant and express eternal verities.Hence there arose a tendency, which has lasted all through philosophy, to contrast the knowledge of universals andintelligibles, as godlike, dignified, and honorable to the knower, with that of particulars and sensibles as somethingrelatively base which more allies us with the beasts.21See, for example, book i, chap. ii, of Aristotle's Metaphysics.2Plato in numerous places, but chiefly in books 6 and 7 of the Republic, contrasts perceptual knowledge as 'opinion' with real knowledge, tothe latter's glory. For an excellent historic sketch of this platonistic view see the first part of E. Laas's Idealismus und Positivismus, 1879.

The impressions themselves have no permanence, no intelligible essence, butare always either arising or ceasing to be. There must be, he tells us, an eternal and clearly definable object of which the visible appearancesto us are the multiform semblance; now by one trait, now by another, the phantom before us reminds us of that half-forgotten celestial realityand makes us utter its name.(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":1072,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1011 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 21]Page 1011Conceptual knowledge—the rationalist viewFor rationalistic writers conceptual knowledge was not only the more noble knowledge, but it originatedindependently of all perceptual particulars. Such concepts as God, perfection, eternity, infinity, immutability, identity,absolute beauty, truth, justice, necessity, freedom, duty, worth, etc., and the part they play in our mind, are, it wassupposed, impossible to explain as results of practical experience. The empiricist view, and probably the true view, isthat they do result from practical experience.1 But a more important question than that as to the origin of our conceptsis that as to their functional use and value;—is that tied down to perceptual experience, or out of all relation to it? Isconceptual knowledge self-sufficing and a revelation all by itself, quite apart from its uses in helping to a betterunderstanding of the world of sense?Rationalists say, Yes. For, as we shall see in later places (page 1017), the various conceptual universes referred to onpage 1009 can be considered in complete abstraction from perceptual reality, and when they are so considered, allsorts of fixed relations can be discovered among their parts. From(Footnote continued from previous page) We and the whole universe exist only in the attempt to return to our perfection, to lose ourselves again in God. That ineffable good isour natural possession; and all we honor in this life is but a partial recovery of our birth-right; every delightful thing is like a rift in theclouds, through which we catch a glimpse of our native heaven. And if that heaven seems so far away, and the idea of it so dim andunreal, it is because we are so far from perfect, so unversed in what is alien and destructive to the soul.' ('Platonic Love in some ItalianPoets,' in Interpretations of Poetry and Religion, 1896.)This is the interpretation of Plato which has been current since Aristotle. It should be said that its profundity has been challenged by Prof. A.J. Stewart. (Plato's Doctrine of Ideas, Oxford, 1909.)Aristotle found great fault with Plato's treatment of ideas as heavenly originals, but he agreed with him fully as to the superior excellence ofthe conceptual or theoretic life. In chapters vii and viii of book x of the Nicomachean Ethics he extols contemplation of universal relations asalone yielding pure happiness. 'The life of God, in all its exceeding blessedness, will consist in the exercise of philosophic thought; and of allhuman activities, that will be the happiest which is most akin to the divine.'1John Locke, in his Essay concerning Human Understanding, books i, ii, was the great popularizer of this doctrine. Condillac's Traité desSensations, Helvetius's work, De l'Homme, and James Mill's Analysis of the Human Mind, were more radical successors of Locke's greatbook."},{"pageNumber":1073,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1012 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 21]Page 1012these the a priori sciences of logic, mathematics, ethics, and ae&lig;sthetics (so far as the last two can be calledsciences at all) result. Conceptual knowledge must thus be called a self-sufficing revelation; and by rationalisticwriters it has always been treated as admitting us to a diviner world, the world of universal rather than that ofperishing facts, of essential qualities, immutable relations, eternal principles of truth and right. Emerson writes:'Generalization is always a new influx of divinity into the mind: hence the thrill that attends it.' And a disciple ofHegel, after exalting the knowledge of 'the General, Unchangeable, and alone, Valuable' above that of 'the Particular,Sensible and Transient,' adds that if you reproach philosophy with being unable to make a single grass-blade grow, oreven to know how it does grow, the reply is that since such a particular 'how' stands not above but below knowledge,strictly so-called, such an ignorance argues no defect.1Conceptual knowledge—the empiricist viewTo this ultra-rationalistic opinion the empiricist contention that the significance of concepts consists always in theirrelation to perceptual particulars has been opposed. Made of percepts, or distilled from parts of percepts, theiressential office, it has been said, is to coalesce with percepts again, bringing the mind back into the perceptual worldwith a better command of the situation there. Certainly whenever we can do this with our concepts, we do more withthem than when we leave them flocking with their abstract and motionless companions. It is possible therefore, to jointhe rationalists in allowing conceptual knowledge to be self-sufficing, while at the same time one joins the empiricistsin maintaining that the full value of such knowledge is got only by combining it with perceptual reality again. Thismediating attitude is that which this book must adopt. But to understand the nature of concepts better we must now goon to distinguish their function from their content.The concept 'man,' to take an example, is three things: I,1Michelet, Hegel's Werke, vii, 15, quoted by A. Gratry, De la Connaissance de l'Âme, i, 231. Compare the similar claim for philosophyin W. Wallace's Prolegomena to Hegel, 2d ed., 1894, pp. 28 29, and the long and radical statement of the same view in book iv of RalphCudworth's Treatise on Eternal and Immutable Morality."},{"pageNumber":1074,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1013 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 22]Page 1013the word itself; 2, a vague picture of the human form which has its own value in the way of beauty or not; and 3, aninstrument for symbolizing certain objects from which we may expect human treatment when occasion arrives.Similarly of 'triangle,' 'cosine,'—they have their substantive value both as words and as images suggested, but theyalso have a functional value whenever they lead us elsewhere in discourse.The content and function of conceptsThere are concepts, however, the image-part of which is so faint that their whole value seems to be functional. 'God,''cause,' 'number,' 'substance,' 'soul,' for example, suggest no definite picture; and their significance seems to consistentirely in their tendency, in the further turn which they may give to our action or our thought.1 We cannot rest in thecontemplation of their form, as we can in that of a 'circle' or a 'man'; we must pass beyond.The pragmatic ruleNow however beautiful or otherwise worthy of stationary contemplation the substantive part of a concept may be, themore important part of its significance may naturally be held to be the consequences to which it leads. These may lieeither in the way of making us think, or in the way of making us act. Whoever has a clear idea of these knowseffectively what the concept practically signifies, whether its substantive content be interesting in its own right or not.This consideration has led to a method of interpreting concepts to which I shall give the name of the Pragmatic Rule.2The pragmatic rule is that the meaning of a concept may always be found, if not in some sensible particular which itdirectly designates, then in some particular difference in the course of human experience which its being true willmake. Test every concept by the question 'What sensible difference to anybody will its truth make?' and you are in thebest possible position for understanding what it means and for discussing its importance. If, questioning whether acertain concept be true or false, you can think of absolutely nothing1On this functional tendency compare H. Taine, On Intelligence, book i, chap. ii (1870).2Compare W. James, Pragmatism, chap. ii and passim; also Baldwin's Dictionary of Philosophy, article 'Pragmatism,' by C. S. Peirce."},{"pageNumber":1075,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1014 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 23]Page 1014that would practically differ in the two cases, you may assume that the alternative is meaningless and that yourconcept is no distinct idea. If two concepts lead you to infer the same particular consequence, then you may assumethat they embody the same meaning under different names.This rule applies to concepts of every order of complexity, from simple terms to propositions uniting many terms.So many disputes in philosophy hinge upon ill-defined words and ideas, each side claiming its own word or idea to betrue, that any accepted method of making meanings clear must be of great utility. No method can be handier ofapplication than our pragmatic rule. If you claim that any idea is true, assign at the same time some difference that itsbeing true will make in some possible person's history, and we shall know not only just what you are really claimingbut also how important an issue it is, and how to go to work to verify the claim. In obeying this rule we neglect thesubstantive content of the concept, and follow its function only. This neglect might seem at first sight to need excuse,for the content often has a value of its own which might conceivably add lustre to reality, if it existed, apart from anymodification wrought by it in the other parts of reality. Thus it is often supposed that 'Idealism' is a theory precious initself, even though no definite change in the details of our experience can be deduced from it. Later discussion willshow that this is a superficial view, and that particular consequences are the only criterion of a concept's meaning, andthe only test of its truth.ExamplesInstances are hardly called for, they are so obvious. That A and B are 'equal,' for example, means either that 'you willfind no difference' when you pass from one to the other, or that in substituting one for the other in certain operations'you will get the >same result both times.' 'Substance' means that 'a definite group of sensations will recur.''Incommensurable' means that 'you are always confronted with a remainder.' 'Infinite' means either that, or that 'youcan count as many units in a part as you can in the whole.' 'More' and 'less' mean certain sensations, varying accordingto the matter. 'Freedom' means 'no feeling of sensible restraint.' 'Necessity' means that 'your way is blocked in alldirections save one.'"},{"pageNumber":1076,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1015 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 23]Page 1015'God' means that 'you can dismiss certain kinds of fear,' 'cause' that 'you may expect certain sequences,' etc. etc. Weshall find plenty of examples in the rest of this book; so I go back now to the more general question of whether thewhole import of the world of concepts lies in its relation to perceptual experience, or whether it be also anindependent revelation of reality. Great ambiguity is possible in answering this question, so we must mind our Ps andQs.Origin of concepts in their utilityThe first thing to notice is that in the earliest stages of human intelligence, so far as we can guess at them, thoughtproper must have had an exclusively practical use. Men classed their sensations, substituting concepts for them, inorder to 'work them for what they were worth,' and to prepare for what might lie ahead. Class-names suggestconsequences that have attached themselves on other occasions to other members of the class—consequences whichthe present percept will also probably or certainly show.1 The present percept in its immediacy may thus often sink tothe status of a bare sign of the consequences which the substituted concept suggests.The substitution of concepts and their connections, of a whole conceptual order, in short, for the immediate perceptualflow, thus widens enormously our mental panorama. Had we no concepts we should live simply 'getting' eachsuccessive moment of experience, as the sessile sea-anemone on its rock receives whatever nourishment the wash ofthe waves may bring. With concepts we go in quest of the absent, meet the remote, actively turn this way or that, bendour experience, and make it tell us whither it is bound. We change its order, run it backwards, bring far bits togetherand separate near bits, jump about over its surface instead of plowing through its continuity, string its items on asmany ideal diagrams as our mind can frame. All these are ways of handling the perceptual flux and meeting distantparts of it; and as far as this primary function of conception goes, we can only conclude it to be what I began bycalling it, a faculty superadded to our barely perceptual consciousness for its use in practically1For practical uses of conception compare W. James, Principles of Psychology, chap. xxii; I. E. Miller, The Psychology of Thinking,1909, passim, but especially chaps. xv, xvi, xvii."},{"pageNumber":1077,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1016 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 24]Page 1016adapting us to a larger environment than that of which brutes take account.1 We harness perceptual reality in conceptsin order to drive it better to our ends.The theoretic use of conceptsDoes our conceptual translation of the perceptual flux enable us also to understand the latter better? What do we meanby making us 'understand'? Applying our pragmatic rule to the interpretation of the word, we see that the better weunderstand anything the more we are able to tell about it. Judged by this test, concepts do make us understand ourpercepts better: knowing what these are, we can tell all sorts of farther truths about them, based on the relation ofthose whats to other whats. The whole system of relations, spatial, temporal, and logical, of our fact, gets plotted out.An ancient philosophical opinion, inherited from Aristotle, is that we do not understand a thing until we know it by itscauses. When the maid-servant says that 'the cat' broke the tea-cup, she would have us conceive the fracture in acausally explanatory way. No otherwise when Clerk-Maxwell asks us to conceive of gas-electricity as due tomolecular bombardment. An imaginary agent out of sight becomes in each case a part of the cosmic context in whichwe now place the percept to be explained; and the explanation is valid in so far as the new causal that is itselfconceived in a context that makes its existence probable, and with a nature agreeable to the effects it is imagined toproduce. All our scientific explanations would seem to conform to this simple type of the 'necessary cat.' Theconceived order of nature built round the perceived order and explaining it theoretically, as we say, is only a system ofhypothetically imagined thats, the whats of which harmoniously connect themselves with the what of any that whichwe immediately perceive.The system is essentially a topographic system, a system of the distribution of things. It tells us what's what, andwhere's where. In so far forth it merely prolongs that opening up of the perspective of practical consequences whichwe found to be the primordial utility of the conceiving faculty: it adapts us to an immense environment. Working bythe causes ofHerbert Spencer in his Psychology, parts iii and iv, has at great length tried to show that such adaptation is the sole meaning of ourintellect."},{"pageNumber":1078,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1017 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 25]Page 1017things we gain advantages which we never should have compassed had we worked by the things alone.In the a priori sciencesBut in order to reach such results the concepts in the explanatory system must, I said, 'harmoniously connect.' Whatdoes that mean? Is this also only a practical advantage, or is it something more? It seems something more, for it pointsto the fact that when concepts of various sorts are once abstracted or constructed, new relations are then foundbetween them, connecting them in peculiarly intimate, 'rational,' and unchangeable ways. In another book1 I have triedto show that these rational relations are all products of our faculty of comparison and of our sense of 'more.'The sciences which exhibit these relations are the so-called a priori sciences of mathematics and logic.2 But thesesciences express relations of comparison and identification exclusively. Geometry and algebra, for example, firstdefine certain conceptual objects, and then establish equations between them, substituting equals for equals. Logic hasbeen defined as the 'substitution of similars'; and in general one may say that the perception of likeness and unlikenessgenerates the whole of 'rational' or 'necessary' truth. Nothing happens in the worlds of logic, mathematics or moraland æsthetic preference. The static nature of the relations in these worlds is what gives to the propositions that expressthem their 'eternal' character: The binomial theorem, e.g., expresses the value of any power of any sum of two terms,to the end of time.These vast unmoving systems of universal terms form the new worlds of thought of which I spoke on page 1011. Theterms are elements (or are framed of elements) abstracted from the perceptual flux; but in their abstract shape we noterelations between them (and again between these relations) which enable us to set up various schemes of fixed serialorders or of 'more and more.' The terms are indeed man-made, but the order, being established solely by comparison,is fixed by the nature of the terms on the one hand and by our power1Principles of Psychology, 1890, chap. xxviii.2The 'necessary' character of the abstract truths which these sciences exhibit is well explained by G. H. Lewes: Problems of Life and Mind,Problem 1, chapters iv, xiii, especially p. 405 f. of the English edition (1874)."},{"pageNumber":1079,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1018 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 25]Page 1018of perceiving relations on the other. Thus two abstract twos are always the same as an abstract four; what contains thecontainer contains the contained of whatever material either be made; equals added to equals always give equalresults, in the world in which abstract equality is the only property the terms are supposed to possess; the more thanthe more is more than the less, no matter in what direction of moreness we advance; if you dot off a term in one seriesevery time you dot one off in another, the two series will either never end, or will come to an end together, or one willbe exhausted first, etc. etc.; the result being those skeletons of 'rational' or 'necessary' truth in which our logic- andmathematics-books (sometimes our philosophy-books) arrange their universal terms.And in physicsThe 'rationalization' of any mass of perceptual fact consists in assimilating its concrete terms, one by one, to so manyterms of the conceptual series, and then in assuming that the relations intuitively found among the latter are whatconnect the former too. Thus we rationalize gaspressure by identifying it with the blows of hypothetic molecules; thenwe see that the more closely the molecules are crowded the more frequent the blows upon the containing walls willbecome; then we discern the exact proportionality of the crowding with the number of blows; so that finally Mariotte'sempirical law gets rationally explained. All our transformations of the sense-order into a more rational equivalent aresimilar to this one. We interrogate the beautiful apparition, as Emerson calls it, which our senses ceaselessly raiseupon our path, and the items there refer us to their interpretants in the shape of ideal constructions in some staticarrangement which our mind has already made out of its concepts alone. The interpretants are then substituted for thesensations, which thus get rationally conceived. To 'explain' means to coördinate, one to one, the thises of theperceptual flow with the whats of the ideal manifold, whichever it be.1We may well call this a theoretic conquest over the order in which nature originally comes. The conceptual order intowhich we translate our experience seems not only a means of1Compare W. Ostwald: Vorlesungen über Naturphilosophie, Sechste Vorlesung."},{"pageNumber":1080,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1019 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 26]Page 1019practical adaptation, but the revelation of a deeper level of reality in things. Being more constant, it is truer, lessillusory than the perceptual order, and ought to command our attention more.Concepts bring new valuesThere is still another reason why conception appears such an exalted function. Concepts not only guide us over themap of life, but we revalue life by their use. Their relation to percepts is like that of sight to touch. Sight indeed helpsus by preparing us for contacts while they are yet far off, but it endows us in addition with a new world of opticalsplendor, interesting enough all by itself to occupy a busy life. Just so do concepts bring their proper splendor. Themere possession of such vast and simple pictures is an inspiring good: they arouse new feelings of sublimity, power,and admiration, new interests and motivations.Ideality often clings to things only when they are taken thus abstractly. ''Causes, as anti-slavery, democracy, etc.,dwindle when realized in their sordid particulars. Abstractions will touch us when we are callous to the concreteinstances in which they lie embodied. Loyal in our measure to particular ideals, we soon set up abstract loyalty assomething of a superior order, to be infinitely loyal to; and truth at large becomes a 'momentous issue' compared withwhich truths in detail are 'poor scraps, mere crumbling successes.'\"1 So strongly do objects that come as universal andeternal arouse our sensibilities, so greatly do life's values deepen when we translate percepts into ideas! Thetranslation appears as far more than the original's equivalent.1J. Royce: The Philosophy of Loyalty, 1908, particularly Lecture vii, $ 5.Emerson writes: 'Each man sees over his own experience a certain stain of error, whilst that of other men looks fair and ideal. Let any mango back to those delicious relations which make the beauty of his life, which have given him sincerest instruction and nourishment, he willshrink and moan. Alas! I know not why, but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the remembrances of budding joy, and cover everybeloved name. Everything is beautiful seen from the point of view of the intellect, or as truth, but all is sour, if seen as experience. Details aremelancholy; the plan is seemly and noble. In the actual world—the painful kingdom of time and place—dwell care, and canker, and fear.With thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the rose of Joy. Round it all the muses sing. But grief clings to names and persons, and thepartial interests of to-day and yesterday.'

They steer us practically every day, and provide an immense map of relations among the elements of things, which,though not now, yet on some possible future occasion, may help to steer us practically;2. They bring new values into our perceptual life, they reanimate our wills, and make our action turn upon new pointsof emphasis;3. The map which the mind frames out of them is an object which possesses, when once it has been framed, anindependent existence. It suffices all by itself for purposes of study. The 'eternal' truths it contains would have to beacknowledged even were the world of sense annihilated.We thus see clearly what is gained and what is lost when percepts are translated into concepts. Perception is solely ofthe here and now; conception is of the like and unlike, of the future, of the past, and of the far away. But this map ofwhat surrounds the present, like all maps, is only a surface; its features are but abstract signs and symbols of thingsthat in themselves are concrete bits of sensible experience. We have but to weigh extent against content, thicknessagainst spread, and we see that for some purposes the one, for other purposes the other, has the higher value. Who candecide offhand which is absolutely better, to live or to understand life? We must do both alternately, and a man canno more limit himself to either than a pair of scissors can cut with a single one of its blades."},{"pageNumber":1082,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1021 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 27]Page 1021Chapter VPercept and Concept—the Abuse of ConceptsThe intellectualist creedIn spite of this obvious need of holding our percepts fast if our conceptual powers are to mean anything distinct, therehas always been a tendency among philosophers to treat conception as the more essential thing in knowledge.1 ThePlatonizing persuasion has ever been that the intelligible order ought to supersede the senses rather than interpretthem. The senses, according to this opinion, are organs of wavering illusion that stand in the way of 'knowledge,' inthe unalterable sense of that term. They are an unfortunate complication on which philosophers may safely turn theirbacks.'Your sensational modalities,' writes one of these, 'are but darkness, remember that. Mount higher, up to reason, andyou will see light. Impose silence on your senses, your imagination, and your passions, and you will then hear thepure voice of interior truth, the clear and evident replies of our common mistress [reason]. Never confound thatevidence which results from the comparison of ideas with the vivacity of those feelings which move and touch you. We must follow reason despite the caresses, the threats and the insults of the body to which we are conjoined, despitethe action of the objects that surround us. I exhort you to recognize the difference there is between knowing andfeeling, between our clear ideas, and our sensations always obscure and confused.'2This is the traditional intellectualist creed. When Plato, its originator, first thought of concepts as forming an entirelyseparate world and treated this as the only object fit for the study of immortal minds, he lit up an entirely new sort ofenthusiasm in the human breast. These objects were precious objects, concrete things were dross. Introduced by Dion,1The traditional rationalist view would have it that to understand life, without entering its turmoil, is the absolutely better part.Philosophy's 'special work,' writes William Wallace, 'is to comprehend the world, not try to make it better' (Prolegomena to the Study ofHegel's Philosophy, 2d edition, Oxford, 1894, p. 29).2Malebranche: Entretiens sur la Métaphysique, 3me.

The citizens began to entertain marvellous hopes of a speedyreformation when they observed the modesty which now ruled the banquets, and the general decorum which reignedin all the court, their tyrant also behaving himself with gentleness and humanity. There was a general passion forreasoning and philosophy, so much so that the very palace, it is reported, was filled with dust by the concourse of thestudents in mathematics who were working their problems there' in the sand. Some 'professed to be indignant that theAthenians, who formerly had come to Syracuse with a great fleet and numerous army, and perished miserably withoutbeing able to take the city, should now, by means of one sophister, overturn the sovereignty of Dionysius; inveiglinghim to cashier his guard of 10,000 lances, dismiss a navy of 400 galleys, disband an army of 10,000 horse and manytimes over that number of foot, and go seek in the schools an unknown and imaginary bliss, and learn by themathematics how to be happy.'Defects of the conceptual translationHaving now set forth the merits of the conceptual translation, I must proceed to show its shortcomings. We extend ourview when we insert our percepts into our conceptual map. We learn about them, and of some of them we transfigurethe value; but the map remains superficial through the abstractness, and false through the discreteness of its elements;and the whole operation, so far from making things appear more rational, becomes the source of quite gratuitousunintelligibilites. Conceptual knowledge is forever inadequate to the fulness of the reality to be known.The insuperability of sensationReality consists of existential particulars as well as of essences and universals and class-names, and of existentialparticulars we become aware only in the perceptual flux. The flux can never be superseded. We must carry it with usto the bitter end of our cognitive business, keeping it in the midst of the translation even when the latter provesilluminating, and falling back on it alone when the translation gives out. 'The insuperability of sensation' would be ashort expression of my thesis."},{"pageNumber":1084,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1023 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 28]Page 1023To prove it, I must show: 1. That concepts are secondary formations, inadequate, and only ministerial; and 2. Thatthey falsify as well as omit, and make the flux impossible to understand.1. Conception is a secondary process, not indispensable to life. It presupposes perception, which is self-sufficing, asall lower creatures, in whom conscious life goes on by reflex adaptations, show.To understand a concept you must know what it means. It means always some this, or some abstract portion of a this,with which we first made acquaintance in the perceptual world, or else some grouping of such abstract portions. Allconceptual content is borrowed: to know what the concept 'color' means you must have seen red or blue, or green. Toknow what 'resistance' means, you must have made some effort; to know what 'motion' means, you must have hadsome experience, active or passive, thereof. This applies as much to concepts of the most rarified order as to qualitieslike 'bright' and 'loud.' To know what the word 'illation' means one must once have sweated through some particularargument. To know what a 'proportion' means one must have compared ratios in some sensible case. You can createnew concepts out of old elements, but the elements must have been perceptually given; and the famous world ofuniversals would disappear like a soap-bubble if the definite contents of feeling, the thises and thats, which its termsseverally denote, could be at once withdrawn. Whether our concepts live by returning to the perceptual world or not,they live by having come from it. It is the nourishing ground from which their sap is drawn.2. Conceptual treatment of perceptual reality makes it seem paradoxical and incomprehensible; and when radically andconsistently carried out, it leads to the opinion that perceptual experience is not reality at all, but an appearance orillusion.Why concepts are inadequateBriefly, this is a consequence of two facts: First, that when we substitute concepts for percepts, we substitute theirrelations also. But since the relations of concepts are of static comparison only, it is impossible to substitute them forthe dynamic relations with which the per-"},{"pageNumber":1085,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1024 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 29]Page 1024ceptual flux is filled. Secondly, the conceptual scheme, consisting as it does of discontinuous terms, can only cover theperceptual flux in spots and incompletely. The one is no full measure of the other, essential features of the fluxescaping whenever we put concepts in its place.This needs considerable explanation, for we have concepts not only of qualities and relations, but of happenings andactions; and it might seem as if these could make the conceptual order active.1 But this would be a false interpretation.The concepts themselves are fixed, even though they designate parts that move in the flux; they do not act, eventhough they designate activities; and when we substitute them and their order, we substitute a scheme the intrinsicallystationary nature of which is not altered by the fact that some of its terms symbolize changing originals. The conceptof 'change,' for example, is always that fixed concept. If it changed, its original self would have to stay to mark what ithad changed from; and even then the change would be a perceived continuous process, of which the translation intoconcepts could only consist in the judgment that later and earlier parts of it1Prof. Hibben, in an article in the Philosophic Review, vol. xix, pp. 125 ff. (1910), seeks to defend the conceptual order against attackssimilar to those in the text, which, he thinks, come from misapprehensions of the true function of logic. 'The peculiar function of thoughtis to represent the continuous,' he says, and he proves it by the example of the calculus. I reply that the calculus, in substituting forcertain perceptual continuities its peculiar symbols, lets us follow changes point by point, and is thus their practical, but not their sensibleequivalent. It cannot reveal any change to one who never felt it, but it can lead him to where the change would lead him. It maypractically replace the change, but it cannot reproduce it. What I am contending for is that the non-reproducible part of reality is anessential part of the content of philosophy, whilst Hibben and the logicists seem to believe that conception, if only adequately attained to,might be all-sufficient. 'It is the peculiar duty and privilege of philosophy,' Mr. Hibben writes, 'to exalt the prerogatives of intellect.' Heclaims that universals are able to deal adequately with particulars, and that concepts do not so exclude each other, as my text has accusedthem of doing. Of course 'synthetic' concepts abound, with subconcepts included in them, and the a priori world is full of them. But theyare all designative; and I think that no careful reader of my text will accuse me of identifying 'knowledge' with either perception orconception absolutely or exclusively. Perception gives 'intension,' conception gives 'extension' to our knowledge."},{"pageNumber":1086,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1025 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 29]Page 1025differed—such 'differences' being conceived as absolutely static relations.Origin of intellectualismWhenever we conceive a thing we define it; and if we still don't understand, we define our definition. Thus I define acertain percept by saying 'this is motion,' or 'I am moving'; and then I define motion by calling it the 'being in newpositions at new moments of time.' This habit of telling what everything is becomes inverterate. The farther we pushit, the more we learn about our subject of discourse, and we end by thinking that knowing the latter always consists ingetting farther and farther away from the perceptual type of experience. This uncriticized habit, added to the intrinsiccharm of the conceptual form, is the source of 'intellectualism' in philosophy.Inadequacy of intellectualismBut intellectualism quickly breaks down. When we try to exhaust motion by conceiving it as a summation of parts, adinfinitum, we find only insufficiency. Although, when you have a continuum given, you can make cuts and dots in it,ad libitum, enumerating the dots and cuts will not give you your continuum back. The rationalist mind admits this; butinstead of seeing that the fault is with the concepts, it blames the perceptual flux. This, Kant contends, has no reality initself, being a mere apparitional birth-place for concepts, to be substituted indefinitely. When these themselves areseen never to attain to a completed sum, reality is sought by such thinkers outside both of the perceptual flow and ofthe conceptual scheme. Kant lodges it before the flow, in the shape of so-called 'things in themselves';1 others place itbeyond perception, as an Absolute (Bradley), or represent it as a Mind whose ways of thinking transcend ours (Green,the Cairds, Royce). In either case, both our percepts and our concepts are held by such philosophers to falsify reality;but the concepts less than the percepts, for they are static, and by all rationalist authors the ultimate reality is supposedto be static also, while perceptual life fairly boils over with activity and change.1'We must suppose Noumena,' says Kant, 'in order to set bounds to the objective validity of sense-knowledge' (Krit. d. Reinen Vernunft,2d ed., p. 310). The old moral need of somehow rebuking 'Sinnlichkeit'!"},{"pageNumber":1087,"pageContent":" Page 1026Examples of puzzles introduced by conceptual translationIf we take a few examples, we can see how many of the troubles of philosophy come from assuming that to beunderstood (or 'known' in the only worthy sense of the word) our flowing life must be cut into discrete bits andpinned upon a fixed relational scheme.Example 1. Activity and causation are incomprehensible, for the conceptual scheme yields nothing like them. Nothinghappens therein: concepts are 'timeless,' and can only be juxtaposed and compared. The concept 'dog' does not bite;the concept 'cock' does not crow. So Hume and Kant translate the fact of causation into the crude juxtaposition of twophenomena. Later authors, wishing to mitigate the crudeness, resolve the adjacency, whenever they can, into identity:cause and effect must be the same reality in disguise, and our perception of difference in these successions thusbecomes an illusion. Lotze elaborately establishes that the 'influencing' of one thing by another is inconceivable.'Influence' is a concept, and, as such, a distinct third thing, to be identified neither with the agent nor the patient. Whatbecomes of it on its way from the former to the latter? And when it finds the latter, how does it act upon it? By asecond influence which it puts forth in turn?—But then again how? and so forth, and so forth till our whole intutionof activity gets branded as illusory because you cannot possibly reproduce its flowing substance by juxtaposing thediscrete. Intellectualism draws the dynamic continuity out of nature as you draw the thread out of a string of beads.Example 2. Knowledge is impossible; for knower is one concept, and known is another. Discrete, separated by achasm, they are mutually 'transcendent' things, so that how an object can ever get into a subject, or a subject ever getat an object, has become the most unanswerable of philosophic riddles. An insincere riddle, too, for the most hardened'epistemologist' never really doubts that knowledge somehow does come off.Example 3. Personal identity is conceptually impossible. 'Ideas' and 'states of mind' are discrete concepts, and a seriesof them in time means a plurality of disconnected terms. To such an atomistic plurality the associationists reduce ourmental life. Shocked at the discontinuous character of their scheme, the"},{"pageNumber":1088,"pageContent":"Document Page 1027spiritualists assume a 'soul' or 'ego' to melt the separate ideas into one collective consciousness. But this ego itself isbut another discrete concept; and the only way not to pile up more puzzles is to endow it with an incomprehensiblepower of producing that very character of manyness-in-oneness of which rationalists refuse the gift when offered inits immediate perceptual form.Example 4. Motion and change are impossible. Perception changes pulsewise, but the pulses continue each other andmelt their bounds. In conceptual translation, however, a continuum can only stand for elements with other elementsbetween them ad infinitum, all separately conceived; and such an infinite series can never be exhausted by successiveaddition. From the time of Zeno the Eleatic, this intrinsic contradictoriness of continuous change has been one of theworst skulls at intellectualism's banquet.Example 5. Resemblance, in the way in which we naïvely perceive it, is an illusion. Resemblance must be defined; andwhen defined it reduces to a mixture of identity with otherness. To know a likeness understandingly we must be ableto abstract the identical point distinctly. If we fail of this, we remain in our perceptual limbo of 'confusion.'Example 6. Our immediate life is full of the sense of direction, but no concept of the direction of a process is possibleuntil the process is completed. Defined as it is by a beginning and an ending, a direction can never be prospectivelybut only retrospectively known. Our perceptual discernment beforehand of the way we are going, and all our dimforetastes of the future, have therefore to be treated as inexplicable or illusory features of experience.Example 7. No real thing can be in two relations at once; the same moon, for example, cannot be seen both by youand by me. For the concept 'seen by you' is not the concept 'seen by me'; and if, taking the moon as a grammaticalsubject and, predicating one of these concepts of it, you then predicate the other also, you become guilty of the logicalsin of saying that a thing can both be A and not-A at once. Learned trifling again; for clear though the conceptualcontradictions be, nobody sincerely disbelieves that two men see the same thing.Example 8. No relation can be comprehended or held to be real"},{"pageNumber":1089,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1028 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 31]Page 1028in the form in which we innocently assume it. A relation is a distinct concept; and when you try to make two otherconcepts continuous by putting a relation between them, you only increase the discontinuity. You have now conceivedthree things instead of two, and have two gaps instead of one to bridge over. Continuity is impossible in theconceptual world.Example 9. The very relation of subject to predicate in our judgments, the backbone of conceptual thinking itself, isunintelligible and self-contradictory. Predicates are ready-made universal ideas by which we qualify perceptualsingulars or other ideas. Sugar, for example, we say 'is' sweet. But if the sugar was already sweet, you have made nostep in knowledge; whilst if not so already, you are identifying it with a concept, with which, in its universality, theparticular sugar cannot be identical. Thus neither the sugar as described, nor your description, is comprehensible.1Attitude of philosophers to the 'dialectic' difficultiesThese profundities of inconceivability, and many others like them, arise from the vain attempt to reconvert themanifold into which our conception has resolved things, back into the continuum out of which it came. The concept'many' is not the concept 'one'; therefore the manyness-in-oneness which perception offers is impossible to construeintellectually. Youthful readers will find such difficulties too whimsical to be taken seriously; but since the days of theGreek sophists these dialectic puzzles have lain beneath the surface of all our thinking like the shoals and snags in theMississippi river; and the more intellectually conscientious the thinkers have been, the less they have allowedthemselves to disregard them. But most philosophers have1I have cited in the text only such conceptual puzzles as have become classic in philosophy, but the concepts current in physical sciencehave also developed mutual oppugnancies which (although not yet classic commonplaces in philosophy) are beginning to makephysicists doubt whether such notions develop unconditional 'truth.' Many physicists now think that the concepts of 'matter,' 'mass,''atom,' 'ether,' 'inertia,' 'force,' etc. are not so much duplicates of hidden realities in nature as mental instruments to handle nature by after-substitution of their scheme. They are considered, like the kilogram or the imperial yard, 'artefacts,' not revelations. The literature here iscopious: J. B. Stallo's Concepts and Theories of Modern Physics (1882); pp. 136 140 especially, are fundamental. March, Ostwald,Pearson, Duhem, Milhaud, LeRoy, Wilbois, H. Poincaré, are other critics of a similar sort."},{"pageNumber":1090,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1029 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 31]Page 1029noticed this or that puzzle only, and ignored the others. The pyrrhonian Sceptics first, then Hegel,1 then in our dayBradley and Bergson, are the only writers I know who have faced them collectively, and proposed a solutionapplicable to them all.The sceptics and HegelThe sceptics gave up the whole notion of truth light-heartedly, and advised their pupils not to care about it.2 Hegelwrote so abominably that I cannot understand him, and will say nothing about him here.3 Bradley and Bergson writewith beautiful clearness and their arguments continue all that I have said.Bradley on percept and conceptMr. Bradley agrees that immediate feeling possesses a native wholeness which conceptual treatment analyzes into amany, but cannot unite again. In every 'this' as merely felt, Bradley says, we 'encounter' reality, but we encounter itonly as a fragment, see it, as it were, only 'through a hole.'4 Our sole practicable way of extending and completing thisfragment is by using our intellect with its universal ideas. But with ideas, that harmonious compenetration ofmanyness-in-oneness which feeling originally gave is no longer possible. Concepts indeed extend our this, but losethe inner secret of its wholeness; when ideal 'truth' is substituted for 'reality' the very nature of 'reality' disappears.The fault being due entirely to the conceptual form in which we have to think things, one might naturally expect thatone who recognizes its inferiority to the perceptual form as clearly as Mr. Bradley does, would try to save both formsfor philosophy, delimiting their scopes, and showing how, as1I omit Herbart, perhaps wrongly.2See any history of philosophy, sub voce 'Pyrrho.'3Hegel connects immediate perception with ideal truth by a ladder of intermediary concepts—at least, I suppose they are concepts. The bestopinion among his interpreters seems to be that ideal truth does not abolish immediate perception, but preserves it as an indispensable'moment.' Compare, e. g., H. W. Dresser: The Philosophy of the Spirit, 1908; Supplementary Essay: 'On the Element of Irrationality in theHegelian Dialectic.' In other words Hegel does not pull up the ladder after him when he gets to the top, and may therefore be counted as anon-intellectualist, in spite of his desperately intellectualist tone.4F. H. Bradley: The Principles of Logic, book i, chap. ii, pp. 29 32."},{"pageNumber":1091,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1030 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 32]Page 1030our experience works, they supplement each other. This is M. Bergson's procedure; but Bradley, though a traitor toorthodox intellectualism in holding fast to feeling as a revealer of the inner oneness of reality, has yet remainedorthodox enough to refuse to admit immediate feeling into 'philosophy' at all. 'For worse or for better,' he writes, 'theman who stays on particular feeling must remain outside philosophy.' The philosopher's business, according to Mr.Bradley, is to qualify the real 'ideally' (i. e. by concepts), and never to look back. The 'ideas' meanwhile yield nothingbut a patchwork, and show no unity like that which the living perception gave. What shall one do in these perplexingcircumstances? Unwilling to go back, Bradley only goes more desperately forward. He makes a flying leap ahead, andassumes, beyond the vanishing point of the whole conceptual perspective, an 'absolute' reality, in which the coherencyof feeling and the completeness of the intellectual ideal shall unite in some indescribable way. Such an absolutetotality-in-unity can be, it must be, it shall be, it is he says. Upon this incomprehensible metaphysical object theBradleyan metaphysic establishes its domain.1Criticism of BradleyThe sincerity of Bradley's criticisms has cleared the air of metaphysics and made havoc with old party lines. But,critical as he is, Mr. Bradley preserves one prejudice uncriticized. Perception 'untransmuted,' he believes, must not,cannot, shall not, enter into final 'truth.'Such loyalty to a blank direction in thought, no matter where it leads you, is pathetic: concepts disintegrate—nomatter, their way must be pursued; percepts are integral—no matter, they must be left behind. When anti-sensationalism has become an obstinacy like this, one feels that it draws near its end.Since it is only the conceptual form which forces the dialectic contradictions upon the innocent sensible reality, theremedy would seem to be simple. Use concepts when they help, and drop them when they hinder understanding; andtake reality bodily and integrally up into philosophy in exactly the perceptual shape in which it comes. The aboriginalflow of1Mr. Bradley has expressed himself most pregnantly in an article in volume xviii, N. S. of Mind, p. 489.

There is always much-at-once of it, but there is never enough, and wedesiderate the rest. The only way to get the rest without wading through all future time in the person of numberlessperceivers, is to substitute our various conceptual systems which, monstrous abridgments though they be, arenevertheless each an equivalent, for some partial aspect of the full perceptual reality which we can never grasp.This, essentially, is Bergson's view of the matter, and with it I think that we should rest content.1SummaryI will now sum up compendiously the result of what precedes. If the aim of philosophy were the taking full possessionof all reality by the mind, then nothing short of the whole of immediate perceptual experience could be the subject-matter of philosophy, for only in such experience is reality intimately and concretely found. But the philosopher,although he is unable as a finite being to compass more than a few passing moments of such experience, is yet able toextend his knowledge beyond such moments by the ideal symbol of the other moments.2 He thus commandsvicariously innumerable perceptions that are out of range. But the concepts by which he does this, being thin extractsfrom perception, are always insufficient representatives thereof; and, although they yield wider information, mustnever be treated after the rationalistic fashion, as if they gave a deeper quality of truth. The deeper features of realityare found only in perceptual experience. Here alone do we acquaint ourselves with continuity, or the immersion ofone thing in another, here alone with self, with substance, with qualities, with activity in its various modes, with time,with cause, with change, with novelty, with tendency, and with freedom. Against all such1Bergson's most compendious statement of his doctrine is in the 'Introduction à la Métaphysique,' in the Revue de Métaphysique et deMorale, 1903, p. i. For a brief comparison between him and Bradley, see an essay by W. James, in the Journal of Philosophy, vol. vii,no. 2.2It would seem that in 'mystical' ways, he may extend his vision to an even wider perceptual panorama than that usually open to the scientificmind. I underst and Bergson to favor some such idea as this. See W. James: 'A Suggestion about Mysticism,' Journal of Philosophy, vii, 4.The subject of mystical knowledge, as yet very imperfectly understood, has been neglected both by philosophers and scientific men."},{"pageNumber":1093,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1032 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 33]Page 1032features of reality the method of conceptual translation, when candidly and critically followed out, can only raise itsnon possumus, and brand them as unreal or absurd."},{"pageNumber":1094,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1033 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 34]Page 1033Chapter VIPercept and Concept—Some CorollariesI.Novelty becomes possibleThe first corollary of the conclusions of the fore-going chapter is that the tendency known in philosophy asempiricism, becomes confirmed. Empiricism proceeds from parts to wholes, treating the parts as fundamental both inthe order of being and in the order of our knowledge.1 In human experience the parts are percepts, built out into thewholes by our conceptual additions. The percepts are singulars that change incessantly and never return exactly asthey were before. This brings an element of concrete novelty into our experience. This novelty finds no representationin the conceptual method, for concepts are abstracted from experiences already seen or given, and he who uses themto divine the new can never do so but in ready-made and ancient terms. Whatever actual novelty the future maycontain (and the singularity and individuality of each moment makes it novel) escapes conceptual treatment altogether.Properly speaking, concepts are post-more preparations, sufficient only for retrospective understanding; and when weuse them to define the universe prospectively we ought to realize that they can give only a bare abstract outline orapproximate sketch, in the filling out of which perception must be invoked.Rationalistic philosophy has always aspired to a rounded-in view of the whole of things, a closed system of kinds,from which the notion of essential novelty being possible is ruled out in advance. For empiricism, on the other hand,reality cannot be thus confined by a conceptual ring-fence. It over-flows, exceeds, and alters. It may turn intonovelties, and can be known adequately only by following its singularities from moment to moment as our experiencegrows. Empiricist philosophy thus renounces the pretension to an all-inclusive1Naturally this applies in the present place only to the greater whole which philosophy considers; the universe namely, and its parts, forthere are plenty of minor wholes (animal and social organisms, for example) in which both the being of the parts and our understandingof the parts are founded."},{"pageNumber":1095,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1034 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 34]Page 1034vision. It ekes out the narrowness of personal experience by concepts which it finds useful but not sovereign; but itstays inside the flux of life expectantly, recording facts, not formulating laws, and never pretending that man's relationto the totality of things as a philosopher is essentially different from his relation to the parts of things as a dailypatient or agent in the practical current of events. Philosophy, like life, must keep the doors and windows open.In the remainder of this book we shall hold fast to this empiricist view. We shall insist that, as reality is createdtemporally day by day, concepts, although a magnificient sketch-map for showing us our bearings, can never fitlysupersede perception, and that the 'eternal' systems which they form should least of all be regarded as realms of beingto know which is a kind of knowing that casts the knowledge of particulars altogether into the shade. That rationalistassumption is quite beside the mark. Thus does philosophy prove again that essential identity with science which weargued for in our first chapter.12.Conceptual systems are distinct realms of realityThe last paragraph does not mean that concepts and the relations between them are not just as 'real' in their 'eternal'way as percepts are in their temporal way. What is it to be 'real'? The best definition I know is that which thepragmatist rule gives: 'anything is real of which we find ourselves obliged to take account in any way.'2 Concepts arethus as real as percepts, for we cannot live a moment without taking account of them. But the 'eternal' kind of beingwhich they enjoy is inferior to the temporal kind, because it is so static and schematic and lacks so many characterswhich temporal reality possesses. Philosophy must thus recognize many realms of reality which mutuallyinterpenetrate. The conceptual systems of mathematics, logic, æsthetics, ethics, are such realms, each strung1One way of stating the empiricist contention is to say that the 'alogical' enters into philosophy on an equal footing with the 'logical.' Mr.Belfort Bax, in his book, The Roots of Reality (1907), formulates his empiricism (such as it is) in this way. (See particularly chap. iii.)Compare also E. D. Fawcett: The Individual and Reality, passim, but especially part ii, chaps. iv and v.2Prof. A. E. Taylor gives this pragmatist definition in his Elements of Metaphysics (1903), p. 51.

B.Russell: Principles of Mathematics."},{"pageNumber":1096,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1035 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 35]Page 1035upon some peculiar form of relation, and each differing from perceptual reality in that in no one of them is history orhappening displayed. Perceptual reality involves and contains all these ideal systems, and vastly more besides.3. The self-sameness of ideal objectsA concept, it was said above, means always the same thing: Change means always change, white always white, acircle always a circle. On this self-sameness of conceptual objects the static and 'eternal' character of our systems ofideal truth is based; for a relation, once perceived to obtain, must obtain always, between terms that do not alter. Butmany persons find difficulty in admitting that a concept used in different contexts can be intrinsically the same. Whenwe call both snow and paper 'white' it is supposed by these thinkers that there must be two predicates in the field. AsJames Mill says:1 'Every colour is an individual colour, every size is an individual size, every shape is an individualshape. But things have no individual colour in common, no individual shape in common; no individual size incommon; that is to say, they have neither shape, colour, nor size in common. What, then, is it which they have incommon which the mind can take into view? Those who affirmed that it was something, could by no means tell. Theysubstituted words for things; using vague and mystical phrases, which, when examined, meant nothing.' The truth,according to this nominalist author, is that the only thing that can be possessed in common by two objects is the samename. Black in the coat and black in the shoe are the same in so far forth as both shoe and coat are called black—thefact that on this view the name can never twice be the 'same' being quite over-looked. What now does the concept'same' signify? Applying, as usual, the pragmatic rule, we find that when we call two objects the same we mean either(a) that no difference can be found between them when compared, or (b) that we can substitute the one for the other incertain operations without changing the result. If we are to discuss sameness profitably we must bear these pragmaticmeanings in mind.Do then the snow and the paper show no difference in color? And can we use them indifferently in operations?1Analysis of the Human Mind (1869), i, 249."},{"pageNumber":1097,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1036 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 35]Page 1036They may certainly replace each other for reflecting light, or be used indifferently as backgrounds to set off anythingdark, or serve as equally good samples of what the word 'white' signifies. But the snow may be dirty, and the paperpinkish or yellowish without ceasing to be called 'white'; or both snow and paper in one light may differ from theirown selves in another and still be 'white,'—so the no-difference criterion seems to be at fault. This physical difficulty(which all house painters know) of matching two tints so exactly as to show no difference seems to be the sort of factthat nominalists have in mind when they say that our ideal meanings are never twice the same. Must we thereforeadmit that such a concept as 'white' can never keep exactly the same meaning?It would be absurd to say so, for we know that under all the modifications wrought by changing light, dirt, impurity inpigment, etc., there is an element of color-quality, different from other color-qualities, which we mean that our wordshall in alterably signify. The impossibility of isolating and fixing this quality physically is irrelevant, so long as wecan isolate and fix it mentally, and decide that whenever we say 'white,' that identical quality, whether applied rightlyor wrongly, is what we shall be held to mean. Our meanings can be the same as often as we intend to have them so,quite irrespective of whether what is meant be a physical possibility or not. Half the ideas we make use of are ofimpossible or problematic things,—zeros, infinites, fourth dimensions, limits of ideal perfection, forces, relationssundered from their terms, or terms defined only conceptually, by their relations to other terms which may be equallyfictitious. 'White' means a color quality of which the mind appoints the standard, and which it can decree to be thereunder all physical disguises. That white is always the same white. What sense can there be in insisting that althoughwe ourselves have fixed it as the same, it cannot be the same twice over? It works perfectly for us on the suppositionthat it is there self-identically; so the nominalist doctrine is false of things of that conceptual sort, and true only ofthings in the perceptual flux.What I am affirming here is the platonic doctrine that concepts are singulars, that concept-stuff is inalterable, and thatphysical realities are constituted by the various concept-"},{"pageNumber":1098,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1037 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 36]Page 1037stuffs of which they 'partake.' It is known as 'logical realism' in the history of philosophy; and has usually been morefavored by rationalistic than by empiricist minds. For rationalism, concept-stuff is primordial and perceptual things aresecondary in nature. The present book, which treats concrete percepts as primordial and concepts as of secondaryorigin, may be regarded as somewhat eccentric in its attempt to combine logical realism with an otherwise empiricistmode of thought.14. Concepts and percepts are con-substantialI mean by this that they are made of the same kind of stuff, and melt into each other when we handle them together.How could it be otherwise when the concepts are like evaporations out of the bosom of perception, into which theycondense again whenever practical service summons them? No one can tell, of the things he now holds in his handand reads, how much comes in through his eyes and fingers, and how much, from his apperceiving intellect, uniteswith that and makes of it this particular 'book'? The universal and the particular parts of the experience are literallyimmersed in each other, and both are indispensable. Conception is not like a painted hook, on which no real chain canbe hung; for we hang concepts upon percepts, and percepts upon concepts interchangeably and indefinitely; and therelation of the two is much more like what we find in those cylindrical 'panoramas' in which a painted backgroundcontinues a real foreground so cunningly that one fails to detect the joint. The world we practically live in is one inwhich it is impossible, except by theoretic retrospection, to disentangle the contributions of intellect from those ofsense. They are wrapt and rolled together as a gunshot in the mountains is wrapt and rolled in fold on fold of echo andreverberative clamor. Even so do intellectual reverberations enlarge and prolong the perceptual experience which theyenvelop, associating it with remoter parts of existence. And the ideas of these in turn work like those resonators thatpick out1For additional remarks in favor of the sameness of conceptual objects, see W. James in Mind, vol. iv, 1879, pp. 331 335; F. H. Bradley:Ethical Studies (1876), pp. 151 154, and Principles of Logic (1883), pp. 260 ff., 282 ff.

They help us to decompose our percept into parts and to abstract and isolate itselements.The two mental functions thus play into each other's hands. Perception prompts our thought, and thought in turnenriches our perception. The more we see, the more we think; while the more we think, the more we see in ourimmediate experiences, and the greater grows the detail and the more significant the articulateness of our perception.1Later, when we come to treat of causal activity, we shall see how practically momentous is this enlargement of thespan of our knowledge through the wrapping of our percepts in ideas. It is the whole coil and compound of both bywhich effects are determined, and they may then be different effects from those to which the perceptual nucleus wouldby itself give rise. But the point is a difficult one and at the present stage of our argument this brief mention of it mustsuffice.5. An objection replied toReaders who by this time agree that our conceptual systems are secondary and on the whole imperfect and ministerialforms of being, will now feel able to return and embrace the flux of their hourly experience with a hearty feeling that,however little of it at a time be given, what is given is absolutely real. Rationalistic thought, with its exclusive interestin the unchanging and the general, has always de-realized the passing pulses of our life. It is no small service onempiricism's part to have exorcised rationalism's veto, and reflectively justified our instinctive feeling aboutimmediate experience. 'Other world?' says Emerson, 'there is no other world,'—than this one, namely, in which ourseveral biographies are founded.'Natur hat weder Kern noch Schale;Alles ist sie mit einem male.''Dich prüfe du nur allermeist,Ob du Kern oder Schale seist.'1Cf. F. C. S. Schiller: 'Thought and Immediacy,' in the Journal of Philosophy, etc., iii, 234. The interpretation goes so deep that we mayeven act as if experience consisted of nothing but the different kinds of concept-stuff into which we analyze it. Such concept-stuff mayoften be treated, for purposes of action and even of discussion, as if it were a full equivalent for reality. But it is needless to repeat, afterwhat precedes, that no amount of it can ever be a full equivalent, and that in point of genesis it remains a secondary formation."},{"pageNumber":1100,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1039 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 37]Page 1039The belief in the genuineness of each particular moment in which we feel the squeeze of this world's life, as weactually do work here, or work is done upon us, is an Eden from which rationalists seek in vain to expel us, now thatwe have criticized their state of mind.But they still make one last attempt, and charge us with self-stultification.'Your belief in the particular moments,' they insist, 'so far as it is based on reflective argument (and is not a mereomission to doubt, like that of cows and horses) is grounded in abstraction and conception. Only by using conceptshave you established percepts in reality. The concepts are the vital things, then, and the percepts are dependent onthem for the character of \"reality\" with which your reasoning endows them. You stand self-contradicted: conceptsappear as the sole triumphant instruments of truth, for you have to employ their proper authority, even when seekingto install perception in authority above them.'The objection is specious; but it disappears the moment one recollects that in the last resort a concept can only bedesignative; and that the concept 'reality,' which we restore to immediate perception, is no new conceptual creation,but only a kind of practical relation to our Will, perceptively experienced,1 which reasoning had temporarilyinterfered with, but which, when the reasoning was neutralized by still further reasoning, reverted to its original seatas if nothing had happened. That concepts can neutralize other concepts is one of their great practical functions. Thisanswers also the charge that it is self-contradictory to use concepts to undermine the credit of conception in general.The best way to show that a knife will not cut is to try to cut with it. Rationalism itself it is that has so fatallyundermined conception, by finding that, when worked beyond a certain point, it only piles up dialectic contradictions.21Compare W. James: Principles of Psychology, chap. xxi, 'The Perception of Reality.'2Compare further, as to this objection, a note in W.

But, though the flux is continuous from next to next, non-adjacent portions of it are separated by parts thatintervene, and such separation seems in a variety of cases to work a positive disconnection. The latter part, e. g., maycontain no element surviving from the earlier part, may be unlike it, may forget it, may be shut off from it by physicalbarriers, or what not. Thus when we use our intellect for cutting up the flux and individualizing its members, we have(provisionally and practically at any rate) to treat an enormous number of these as if they were unrelated or relatedonly remotely, to one another. We handle them piecemeal or distributively, and look at the entire flux as if it weretheir sum or collection. This encourages the empiricist notion, that the parts are distinct and that the whole is aresultant.This doctrine rationalism opposes, contending that the whole is fundamental, that the parts derive from it and allbelong with one another, that the separations we uncritically accept are illusory, and that the entire universe, instead ofbeing a sum, is the only genuine unit in existence, constituting (in the words often quoted from d'Alembert) 'un seulfait et une grande vérité.'The alternative here is known as that between pluralism and monism. It is the most pregnant of all the dilemmas ofphilosophy, although it is only in our time that it has been articulated distinctly. Does reality exist distributively? orcollectively?—in the shape of eaches, everys, anys, eithers? or only in the shape of an all or whole? An identicalcontent is compatible with either form obtaining, the Latin omnes, or cuncti, or the German alle or sämmtlicheexpressing the alternatives familiarly. Pluralism stands for the distributive, monism for the collective form of being.Please note that pluralism need not be supposed at the outset to stand for any particular kind or amount of dis-"},{"pageNumber":1102,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1041 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 37]Page 1041connection between the many things which it assumes. It only has the negative significance of contradicting monism'sthesis that there is absolutely no disconnection. The irreducible outness of anything, however infinitesimal, fromanything else, in any respect, would be enough, if it were solidly established, to ruin the monistic doctrine.I hope that the reader begins to be pained here by the extreme vagueness of the terms I am using. To say that there is'no disconnection,' is on the face of it simply silly, for we find practical disconnections without number. My pocket isdisconnected with Mr. Morgan's bank-account, and King Edward VII's mind is disconnected with this book. Monismmust mean that all such apparent disconnections are bridged over by some deeper absolute union in which it believes,and this union must in some way be more real than the practical separations that appear upon the surface.Kinds of monismIn point of historical fact monism has generally kept itself vague and mystical as regards the ultimate principle ofunity.Mystical monismTo be One is more wonderful than to be many, so the principle of things must be One, but of that One no exactaccount is given. Plotinus simply calls it the One. 'The One is all things and yet no one of them. For the very reasonthat none of them was in the One, are all derived from it. Furthermore, in order that they may be real existences, theOne is not an existence, but the father of existences. And the generation of existence is as it were the first act ofgeneration. Being perfect by reason of neither seeking nor possessing nor needing anything, the One overflows, as itwere, and what overflows forms another hypostasis. How should the most perfect and primal good stay shut up initself as if it were envious or impotent? Necessarily then something comes from it.'1This is like the Hindoo doctrine of the Brahman, or of the Âtman. In the Bhagavat-gita the holy Krishna speaking forthe One, says: 'I am the immolation. I am the sacrificial rite. I am the libation offered to ancestors. I am the drug. I amthe incantation. I am the sacrificial butter also. I am the fire.1Compare the passages in C. M. Bakewell's Source-Book in Ancient Philosophy, pp. 363 370, or the first four books of the Vth Enneadgenerally, in M. N.

I heat (the world). I withhold and pour outthe rain. I am ambrosia and death, the existing and the non-existing I am the same to all beings. I have neither foenor friend. Place they heart on me, worshipping me, sacrificing to me, saluting me.'1I call this sort of monism mystical, for it not only revels in formulas that defy understanding,2 but it accredits itself byappealing to states of illumination not vouchsafed to common men. Thus Porphyry, in his life of Plotinus, after sayingthat he himself once had such an insight, when 68 years old, adds that whilst he lived with Plotinus, the latter fourtimes had the happiness of approaching the supreme God and consciously uniting with him in a real and ineffable act.The regular mystical way of attaining the vision of the One is by ascetic training, fundamentally the same in allreligious systems. But this ineffable kind of Oneness is not strictly philosophical, for philosophy is essentiallytalkative and explicit, so I must pass it by.Monism of substanceThe usual philosophic way of reaching deeper oneness has been by the conception of substance. First used by theGreeks, this notion was elaborated with great care during the Middle Ages. Defined as any being that exists per se, sothat it needs no further subject in which to inhere (Ens ita per se existens, ut non indigeat alio tamquam1J. C. Thomson's translation, chap. iv.2Al-Ghazzali, the Mohammedan philosopher and mystic, gives a more theistic version of essentially the same idea: 'Allah is the guider arightand the leader astray; he does what he wills and decides what he wishes; there is no opposer of his decision and no repeller of his decree. Hecreated the Garden, and created for it a people, then used them in obedience. And he created the Fire, and created for it a people, then usedthem in rebellion. Then he said, as has been handed down from the Prophet: \"These are in the Garden, and I care not; and these are in theFire, and I care not.\" So he is Allah, the Most High, the King, the Reality. He is not asked concerning what he does; but they are asked.' (D.B. MacDonald's translation, in Hartford Seminary Record, January, 1910.) Compare for other quotations, W.

It was then identified with the 'principle of individuality' in things,and with their 'essence,' and divided into various types, for example into first and second, simple and compound,complete and incomplete, specific and individual, material and spiritual substances. God, on this view, is a substance,for he exists per se, as well as a se; but of secondary beings, he is the creator, not the substance, for once created,they also exist per se though not a se. Thus, for scholasticism, the notion of substance is only a partial unifier, and inits totality, the universe forms a pluralism from the substance-point-of-view.1Spinoza broke away from the scholastic doctrine. He began his 'Ethics' by demonstrating that only one substance ispossible, and that that substance can only be the infinite and necessary God.2 This heresy brought reprobation onSpinoza, but it has been favored by philosophers and poets ever since.1Consult the word 'substance' in the index of any scholastic manual, such as J. Rickaby: General Metaphysics; A. Stöckl: Lebrbuch d.Phil.; or P. M. Liberatore: Compendium Logiceq et Metaphysicq.2Spinoza has expressed his doctrine briefly in part i of the Appendix to his Ethics: 'I have now explained,' he says, 'the nature of God, andhis properties; such as that he exists necessarily; that he is unique; that what he is and does flows from the sole necessity of his nature; that heis the free cause of all things whatever; that all things are in God and depend on him in such wise that they can neither be nor be conceivedwithout him; and finally, that all things have been predetermined by God, not indeed by the freedom of his will, or according to his goodpleasure, but in virtue of his absolute nature or his infinite potentiality.'—Spinoza goes on to refute the vulgar notion of final causes. Godpursues no ends—if he did he would lack something. He acts out of the logical necessity of the fulness of his nature.—I find another goodmonistic statement in a book of the spinozistic type:—' The existence of every compound object in manifestation does not lie in the objectitself, but lies in the universal existence which is an absolute unit, containing in itself all that is manifested. All the particularized beings,therefore, are incessantly changing one into the other, coming and going, forming and dissolving through the one universal cause of thepotential universe, which is the absolute unit of universal existence, depending on the one general law, the one mathematical bond, which isthe absolute being, and it changes not in all eternity. Thus, it is the universe as a whole, in its potential being, from which the physicaluniverse is individualized; and its being is a mathematical inference from a mathematical or an intellectual universe which was and ever ispreviously formed by an intellect standing and existing by itself.(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":1105,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1044 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 39]Page 1044The pantheistic spinozistic unity was too sublime a prospect not to captivate the mind. It was not till Locke, Berkeley,and Hume began to put in their 'critical' work that the suspicion began to gain currency that the notion of substancemight be only a word masquerading in the shape of an idea.1Critique of substanceLocke believed in substances, yet confessed that 'we have no such clear idea at all, but only an uncertain suppositionof we know not what, which we take to be the substratum, or support of those ideas we do not know.'2 He criticizedthe notion of personal substance as the principles of self-sameness in our different minds. Experientially, our personalidentity consists, he said, in nothing more than the functional and perceptible fact that our later states of mind continueand remember our earlier ones.3Berkeley applied the same sort of criticism to the notion of bodily substance. 'When I consider,' he says, 'the two parts(\"being\" in general, and \"supporting accidents\") which make the signification of the words \"material substance,\" I amconvinced there is no distinct meaning annexed to them. Suppose an intelligence without the help of external bodiesto be affected with the same train of sensations that you are, imprinted in the same order, and with like vividness inhis mind. I ask whether that intelligence hath not all the reason to believe the existence of corporeal substances,represented by his ideas, and exciting them in his mind, that you can(Footnote continued from previous page)This mathematical or intellectual universe I call Absolute Intellectuality, the God of the Universe.'(Solomon J. Silberstein: The Disclosures of the Universal Mysteries, New York, 1906, pp. 12 13.)1No one believes that such words as 'winter,' 'army,' 'house,' denote substances. They designate collective facts, of which the parts are heldtogether by means that can be experimentally traced. Even when we can't define what groups the effects together, as in 'poison,' 'sickness,''strength,' we don't assume a substance, but are willing that the word should designate some phenomenal agency yet to be found out.Nominalists treat all substances after this analogy, and consider 'matter,' 'gold,' 'soul,' as but the names of so many grouped properties, ofwhich the bond of union must be, not some unknowable substance corresponding to the name, but rather some hidden portion of the wholephenomenal fact.2Essay concerning Human Understanding, book i, chap. iv, $ 18.3Ibid., book ii, chap. xxvii, $$ 9 27."},{"pageNumber":1106,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1045 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 39]Page 1045possibly have for believing the same thing.'1 Certain grouped sensations, in short, are all that corporeal substances areknown-as, therefore the only meaning which the word 'matter' can claim is that it denotes such sensations and theirgroupings. They are the only verifiable aspect of the word.The reader will recognize that in these criticisms our own pragmatic rule is used. What difference in practicalexperience is it supposed to make that we have each a personal substantial principle? This difference, that we canremember and appropriate our past, calling it 'mine.' What difference that in this book there is a substantial principle?This, that certain optical and tactile sensations cling permanently together in a cluster. The fact that certain perceptualexperiences do seem to belong together is thus all that the word substance means. Hume carries the criticism to thelast degree of clearness. 'We have no idea of substance,' he says, 'distinct from that of a collection of particularqualities, nor have we any other meaning when we either talk or reason concerning it. The idea of a substance isnothing but a collection of simple ideas that are united by the imagination and have a particular name assigned themby which we are able to recall that collection.'2 Kant's treatment of substance agrees with Hume's in denying allpositive content to the notion. It differs in insisting that, by attaching shifting percepts to the permanent name, thecategory of substance unites them necessarily together, and thus makes nature intelligible.3 It is impossible to assentto this. The grouping of qualities becomes no more intelligible when you call substance a 'category' than when youcall it a bare word.Pragmatic analysis of onenessLet us now turn our backs upon ineffable or unintelligible ways of accounting for the world's oneness, and inquirewhether, instead of being a principle, the 'oneness' affirmed may not merely be a name like 'substance,' descriptive ofthe fact that certain specific and verifiable connections are found among the parts of the experiential1Principles of Human Knowledge, part i, $$17, 20.2Treatise on Human Nature, part 1, $ 6.3Critique of Pure Reason: First Analogy of Experience.

This brings us back to our pragmatic rule: Suppose there is a oneness in things, what may it be known-as? Whatdifferences to you and me will it make?Our question thus turns upside down, and sets us on a much more promising inquiry. We can easily conceive of thingsthat shall have no connection whatever with each other. We may assume them to inhabit different times and spaces, asthe dreams of different persons do even now. They may be so unlike and incommensurable, and so inert towards oneanother, as never to jostle or interfere. Even now there may actually be whole universes so disparate from ours that wewho know ours have no means of perceiving that they exist. We conceive their diversity, however; and by that fact thewhole lot of them form what is known in logic as one 'universe of discourse.' To form a universe of discourse argues,as this example shows, no further kind of connection. The importance attached by certain monistic writers to the factthat any chaos may become a universe by being merely named, is to me incomprehensible. We must seek somethingbetter in the way of oneness than this susceptibility of being mentally considered together, and named by a collectivenoun.What connections may be perceived concretely or in point of fact, among the parts of the collection abstractlydesignated as our 'world'?Kinds of onenessThere are innumerable modes of union among its parts, some obtaining on a larger, some on a smaller scale. Not allthe parts of our world are united mechanically, for some can move without the others moving. They all seem united bygravitation, however, so far as they are material things. Some again of these are united chemically, while others arenot; and the like is true of thermic, optical, electrical, and other physical connections. These connections arespecifications of what we mean by the word oneness when we apply it to our world. We should not call it one unlessits parts were connected in these and other ways. But then it is clear that by the same logic we ought to call it 'many,'so far as its parts are disconnected in these same ways, chemically inert towards one another or non-conductors toelectricity, light and heat. In all these modes of union, some parts of the world prove to be conjoined with other parts,so that if you"},{"pageNumber":1108,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1047 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 40]Page 1047choose your line of influence and your items rightly, you may travel from pole to pole without an interruption. If,however, you choose them wrongly, you meet with obstacles and non-conductors from the outset, and cannot travel atall. There is thus neither absolute oneness nor absolute manyness from the physical point of view, but a mixture ofwell-definable modes of both. Moreover, neither the oneness nor the manyness seems the more essential attribute,they are co-ordinate features of the natural world.There are plenty of other practical differences meant by calling a thing One. Our world, being strung along in timeand space, has temporal and spatial unity. But time and space relate things by determinately sundering them, so it ishard to say whether the world ought more to be called 'one' or 'many' in this spatial or temporal regard.The like is true of the generic oneness which comes from so many of the worlds being similar. When two things aresimilar you can make inferences from the one which will hold good of the other, so that this kind of union amongthings, so far as it obtains, is inexpressibly precious from the logical point of view. But an infinite heterogeneityamong things exists alongside of whatever likeness of kind we discover; and our world appears no more distinctly oressentially as a One than as a Many, from this generic point of view.We have touched on the noetic unity predicable of the world in consequence of our being able to mean the whole of itat once. Widely different from unification by an abstract designation, would be the concrete noetic union wrought byan all-knower of perceptual type who should be acquainted at one stroke with every part of what exists. In such anabsolute all-knower idealists believe. Kant, they say, virtually replaced the notion of Substance, by the moreintelligible notion of Subject. The 'I am conscious of it,' which on some witness's part must accompany every possibleexperience, means in the last resort, we are told, one individual witness of the total frame of things, world withoutend, amen. You may call his undivided act of omniscience instantaneous or eternal, whichever you like, for time is itsobject just as everything else is, and itself is not in time.Unity by concatenationWe shall find reasons later for treating noetic monism as an"},{"pageNumber":1109,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1048 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 40]Page 1048unverified hypothesis. Over against it there stands the noetic pluralism which we verify every moment when we seekinformation from our friends. According to this, everything in the world might be known by somebody, yet noteverything by the same knower, or in one single cognitive act,—much as all mankind is knit in one network ofacquaintance, A knowing B, B knowing C,—Y knowing Z, and Z possibly knowing A again, without the possibility ofanyone knowing everybody at once. This 'concatenated' knowing, going from next to next, is altogether different fromthe 'consolidated' knowing supposed to be exercised by the absolute mind. It makes a coherent type of universe inwhich the widest knower that exists may yet remain ignorant of much that is known to others.There are other systems of concatenation besides the noetic concatenation. We ourselves are constantly adding to theconnections of things, organizing labor-unions, establishing postal, consular, mercantile, railroad, telegraph, colonial,and other systems that bind us and things together in ever wider reticulations. Some of these systems involve others,some do not. You cannot have a telephone system without air and copper connections, but you can have air andcopper connections without telephones. You cannot have love without acquaintance, but you can have acquaintancewithout love, etc. The same thing, moreover, can belong to many systems, as when a man is connected with otherobjects by heat, by gravitation, by love, and by knowledge.From the point of view of these partial systems, the world hangs together from next to next in a variety of ways, sothat when you are off of one thing you can always be on to something else, without ever dropping out of your world.Gravitation is the only positively known sort of connection among things that reminds us of the consolidated ormonistic form of union. If a 'mass' should change anywhere, the mutual gravitation of all things would instantaneouslyalter.Unity of purpose, meaningTeleological and æsthetic unions are other forms of systematic union. The world is full of partial purposes, of partialstories. That they all form chapters of one supreme purpose and inclusive story is the monistic conjecture. They seem,meanwhile, simply to run along-"},{"pageNumber":1110,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1049 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 41]Page 1049side of each other—either irrelevantly, or, where they interfere, leading to mutual frustrations,—so the appearance ofthings is invincibly pluralistic from this purposive point of view.Unity of originIt is a common belief that all particular beings have one origin and source, either in God, or in atoms all equally old.There is no real novelty, it is believed, in the universe, the new things that appear having either been eternallyprefigured in the absolute, or being results of the same primordia rerum, atoms, or monads, getting into new mixtures.But the question of being is so obscure anyhow, that whether realities have burst into existence all at once, by a single'bang,' as it were; or whether they came piecemeal, and have different ages (so that real novelties may be leaking intoour universe all the time), may here be left an open question, though it is undoubtedly intellectually economical tosuppose that all things are equally old, and that no novelties leak in.SummaryThese results are what the Oneness of the Universe is known-as. They are the oneness, pragmatically considered. Aworld coherent in any of these ways would be no chaos, but a universe of such or such a grade. (The grades mightdiffer, however. The parts, e. g., might have space-relations, but nothing more; or they might also gravitate; orexchange heat; or know, or love one another, etc.)Such is the cash-value of the world's unity, empirically realized. Its total unity is the sum of all the partial unities. Itconsists of them and follows upon them. Such an idea, however, outrages rationalistic minds, which habitually despiseall this practical small-change. Such minds insist on a deeper, more through-and-through union of all things in theabsolute, 'each in all and all in each,' as the prior condition of these empirically ascertained connections. But this maybe only a case of the usual worship of abstractions, like calling 'bad weather' the cause of to-day's rain, etc., oraccounting for a man's features by his 'face,' when really the rain is the bad weather, is what you mean by 'badweather,' just as the features are what you mean by the face.To sum up, the world is 'one' in some respects, and 'many' in others.

Once we are committed to this soberer view, the questionof the One or the Many may well cease to appear important. The amount either of unity or of plurality is in short onlya matter for observation to ascertain and write down, in statements which will have to be complicated, in spite ofevery effort to be concise."},{"pageNumber":1112,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1051 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 41]Page 1051Chapter VIIIThe One and the Many (continued)—Values and DefectsWe might dismiss the subject with the preceding chapter1 were it not for the fact that further consequences followfrom the rival hypotheses, and make of the alternative of monism or pluralism what I called it on page 1040, the most'pregnant' of all the dilemmas of metaphysics.The monistic theoryTo begin with, the attribute 'one' seems for many persons to confer a value, an ineffable illustriousness and dignityupon the world, with which the conception of it as an irreducible 'many' is believed to clash.Secondly, a through-and-through noetic connection of everything with absolutely everything else is in some quartersheld to be indispensable to the world's rationality. Only then might we believe that all things really do belong together,instead of being connected by the bare conjunctions 'with' or 'and.' The notion that this latter pluralistic arrangementmay obtain is deemed 'irrational'; and of course it does make the world partly alogical or non-rational from a purelyintellectual point of view.The value of absolute onenessMonism thus holds the oneness to be the more vital and essential element. The entire cosmos must be a consolidatedunit, within which each member is determined by the whole to be just that, and from which the slightest incipiency ofindependence anywhere is ruled out. With Spinoza, monism likes to believe that all things follow from the essence ofGod as necessarily as from the nature of a triangle it follows that the angles are equal to two right angles. The whole iswhat yields the parts, not the parts the whole. The universe is tight, monism claims, not loose; and you must take theirreducible whole of it just as it is offered, or have no part or lot in it at all. The only alternative allowed by monisticwriters is to confess the world's non-rationality—and no philosopher can permit himself to1For an amplification of what precedes, the lecture on 'The One and the Many' in W. James: Pragmatism (1907), may be referred to."},{"pageNumber":1113,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1052 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 42]Page 1052do that. The form of monism regnant at the present day in philosophic circles is absolute idealism. For this way ofthinking, the world exists no otherwise than as the object of one infinitely knowing mind. The analogy that suggeststhe hypothesis here is that of our own finite fields of consciousness, which at every moment envisage a much-at-oncecomposed of parts related variously, and in which both the conjunctions and the disjunctions that appear are there onlyin so far as we are there as their witnesses, so that they are both 'noetically' and monistically based.Its defectsWe may well admit the sublimity of this noetic monism and of its vague vision of an underlying connection amongall phenomena without exception.1 It shows itself also able to confer religious stability and peace, and it invokes theauthority of mysticism in its favor. Yet, on the other hand, like many another concept unconditionally carried out, itintroduces into philosophy puzzles peculiar to itself, as follows:—1. It does not account for our finite consciousness. If nothing exists but as the Absolute Mind knows it, how cananything exist otherwise than as that Mind knows it? That Mind knows each thing in one act of knowledge, alongwith every other thing. Finite minds know things without other things, and this ignorance is the source of most oftheir woes. We are thus not simply objects to an all-knowing subject: we are subjects on our own account and knowdifferently from its knowing.2. It creates a problem of evil. Evil, for pluralism, presents only the practical problem of how to get rid of it. Formonism the puzzle is theoretical: How—if Perfection be the source, should there be Imperfection? If the world asknown to the Absolute be perfect, why should it be known otherwise, in myriads of inferior finite editions also? Theperfect edition surely was enough. How do the breakage and dispersion and ignorance get in?3. It contradicts the character of reality as perceptually experienced. Of our world, change seems an essential in-1In its essential features, Spinoza was its first prophet, Fichte and Hegel were its middle exponents, and Josiah Royce is its bestcontemporary representative."},{"pageNumber":1114,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1053 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 42]Page 1053gredient. There is history. There are novelties, struggles, losses, gains. But the world of the Absolute is represented asunchanging, eternal, or 'out of time,' and is foreign to our powers either of apprehension or of appreciation. Monismusually treats the sense-world as a mirage or illusion.4. It is fatalistic. Possibility, as distinguished from necessity on the one hand and from impossibility on the other, is anessential category of human thinking. For monism, it is a pure illusion; for whatever is is necessary, and aught else isimpossible, if the world be such a unit of fact as monists pretend.Our sense of 'freedom' supposes that some things at least are decided here and now, that the passing moment maycontain some novelty, be an original starting-point of events, and not merely transmit a push from elsewhere. Weimagine that in some respects at least the future may not be co-implicated with the past, but may be really addable toit, and indeed addable in one shape or another, so that the next turn in events can at any given moment genuinely beambiguous, i. e., possibly this, but also possibly that.Monism rules out this whole conception of possibles, so native to our common-sense. The future and the past arelinked, she is obliged to say; there can be no genuine novelty anywhere, for to suppose that the universe has aconstitution simply additive, with nothing to link things together save what the words 'plus,' 'with,' or 'and' stand for, isrepugnant to our reason.The pluralistic theoryPluralism, on the other hand, taking perceptual experience at its face-value, is free from all these difficulties. Itprotests against working our ideas in a vacuum made of conceptual abstractions. Some parts of our world, it admits,cannot exist out of their wholes; but others, it says, can. To some extent the world seems genuinely additive: it mayreally be so. We cannot explain conceptually how genuine novelties can come; but if one did come we couldexperience that it came. We do, in fact, experience perceptual novelties all the while. Our perceptual experienceoverlaps our conceptual reason: the that transcends the why. So the common-sense view of life, as something reallydramatic, with work done, and things decided here and now, is acceptable to"},{"pageNumber":1115,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1054 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 43]Page 1054pluralism. 'Free will' means nothing but real novelty; so pluralism accepts the notion of free will.But pluralism, accepting a universe unfinished, with doors and windows open to possibilities uncontrollable inadvance, gives us less religious certainty than monism, with its absolutely closed-in world. It is true that monism'sreligious certainty is not rationally based, but is only a faith that 'sees the All-Good in the All-Real.' In point of fact,however, monism is usually willing to exert this optimistic faith: its world is certain to be saved, yes, is saved already,unconditionally and from eternity, in spite of all the phenomenal appearances of risk.1Its defectsA world working out an uncertain destiny, as the phenomenal world appears to be doing, is an intolerable idea to therationalistic mind.Pluralism, on the other hand, is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but melioristic, rather. The world, it thinks, may besaved, on condition that its parts shall do their best. But shipwreck in detail, or even on the whole, is among the openpossibilities.There is thus a practical lack of balance about pluralism, which contrasts with monism's peace of mind. The one is amore moral, the other a more religious view; and different men usually let this sort of consideration determine theirbelief.2Its advantagesSo far I have sought only to show the respective implications of the rival doctrines without dogmatically decidingwhich is the more true. It is obvious that pluralism has three great advantages:—1. It is more 'scientific,' in that it insists that when oneness is predicated, it shall mean definitely ascertainableconjunctive forms. With these the disjunctions ascertainable among things are exactly on a par. The two are co-ordinate aspects of reality. To make the conjunctions more vital and primordial than the separations, monism has toabandon verifiable experience and proclaim a unity that is indescribable.1For an eloquent expression of the monistic position, from the religious point of view, read J. Royce: The World and the Individual, vol.ii, lectures 8, 9, 10.2See, as to this religious difference, the closing lecture in W. James's Pragmatism."},{"pageNumber":1116,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1055 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 43]Page 10552. It agrees more with the moral and dramatic expressiveness of life.3. It is not obliged to stand for any particular amount of plurality, for it triumphs over monism if the smallest morselof disconnectedness is once found undeniably to exist. 'Ever not quite' is all it says to monism; while monism isobliged to prove that what pluralism asserts can in no amount whatever possibly be true—an infinitely harder task.The advantages of monism, in turn, are its natural affinity with a certain kind of religious faith, and the peculiaremotional value of the conception that the world is a unitary fact.So far has our use of the pragmatic rule brought us towards understanding this dilemma. The reader will by this timefeel for himself the essential practical difference which it involves. The word 'absence' seems to indicate it. Themonistic principle implies that nothing that is can in any whatever be absent from anything else that is. The pluralisticprinciple, on the other hand, is quite compatible with some things being absent from operations in which other thingsfind themselves singly or collectively engaged. Which things are absent from which other things, and when,—these ofcourse are questions which a pluralistic philosophy can settle only by an exact study of details. The past, the present,and the future in perception, for example, are absent from one another, while in imagination they are present or absentas the case may be. If the time-content of the world be not one monistic block of being, if some part, at least, of thefuture, is added to the past without being virtually one therewith, or implicitly contained therein, then it is absentreally as well as phenomenally and may be called an absolute novelty in the world's history in so far forth.Monism, pluralism, and noveltyTowards this issue, of the reality or unreality of the novelty that appears, the pragmatic difference between monismand pluralism seems to converge. That we ourselves may be authors of genuine novelty is the thesis of the doctrine offree-will. That genuine novelties can occur means that from the point of view of what is already given, what comesmay have to be treated as a matter of chance. We are led thus to ask the question: In what manner"},{"pageNumber":1117,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1056 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 44]Page 1056does new being come? Is it through and through the consequence of older being or is it matter of chance so far asolder being goes?—which is the same thing as asking: Is it original, in the strict sense of the word?We connect again here with what was said at the end of Chapter III. We there agreed that being is a datum or gift andhas to be begged by the philosopher; but we left the question open as to whether he must beg it all at once or beg itbit by bit or in instalments. The latter is the more consistently empiricist view, and I shall begin to defend it in thechapter that follows."},{"pageNumber":1118,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1057 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 44]Page 1057Chapter IXThe Problem of NoveltyThe impotence to explain being which we have attributed to all philosophers is, it will be recollected, a conceptualimpotence. It is when thinking abstractly of the whole of being at once, as it confronts us ready-made, that we feel ourpowerlessness so acutely. Possibly, if we followed the empiricist method, considering the parts rather than the whole,and imagining ourselves inside of them perceptually, the subject might defy us less provokingly. We are thus broughtback to the problem with which Chapter VII left off. When perceptible amounts of new phenomenal being come tobirth, must we hold them to be in all points predetermined and necessary outgrowths of the being already there, orshall we rather admit the possibility that originality may thus instill itself into reality?Perceptual noveltyIf we take concrete perceptual experience, the question can be answered in only one way. 'The same returns not, saveto bring the different.' Time keeps budding into new moments, every one of which presents a content which in itsindividuality never was before and will never be again. Of no concrete bit of experience was an exact duplicate everframed. 'My youth,' writes Delb uf, 'has it not taken flight, carrying away with it love, illusion, poetry, and freedomfrom care, and leaving with me instead science, austere always, often sad and morose, which sometimes I wouldwillingly forget, which repeats to me hour by hour its grave lessons, or chills me by its threats? Will time, whichuntiringly piles deaths on births, and births on deaths, ever remake an Aristotle or an Archimedes, a Newton or aDescartes? Can our earth ever cover itself again with those gigantic ferns, those immense equisetaceans, in the midstof which the same antediluvian monsters will crawl and wallow as they did of yore? No, what has been will not,cannot, be again. Time moves on with an unfaltering tread, and never strikes twice an identical hour. The instants ofwhich the existence of the world is composed are all dissimilar,—and what-"},{"pageNumber":1119,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1058 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 45]Page 1058ever may be done, something remains that can never be reversed.'1Science and noveltyThe everlasting coming of concrete novelty into being is so obvious that the rationalizing intellect, bent ever onexplaining what is by what was, and having no logical principle but identity to explain by, treats the perceptual flux asa phenomenal illusion, resulting from the unceasing re-combination in new forms of mixture, of unalterable elements,coeval with the world. These elements are supposed to be the only real beings; and, for the intellect once grasped bythe vision of them, there can be nothing genuinely new under the sun. The world's history, according to molecularscience, signifies only the 'redistribution' of the unchanged atoms of the primal firemist, parting and meeting so as toappear to us spectators in the infinitely diversified configurations which we name as processes and things.2Personal experience and noveltySo far as physical nature goes few of us experience any temptation to postulate real novelty. The notion of eternalelements and their mixture serves us in so many ways, that1J. Delb uf: Revue Philosophique, vol. ix, p. 138 (1880). On the infinite variety of reality, compare also W. T. Marvin: An Introduction toSystematic Philosophy, New York, 1903, pp. 22 30.2The Atomistic philosophy, which has proved so potent a scientific instrument of explanation, was first formulated by Democritus, who died370 B. C. His life overlapped that of Aristotle, who took what on the whole may be called a biological view of the world, and for whom'forms' were as real as elements. The conflict of the two modes of explanation has lasted to our day, for some chemists still defend theAristotelian tradition which the authority of Descartes had interrupted for so long, and deny our right to say that 'water' is not a simple entity,or that oxygen and hydrogen atoms persist in it unchanged. Compare W. Ostwald: Die Ueberwindung des wissenschaftlichen Materialismus(1895), p. 12: 'The atomistic view assumes that when in ironoxide, for example, all the sensible properties both of iron and oxygen havevanished, iron and oxygen are nevertheless there but now manifest other properties. We are so used to this assumption that it is hard for us tofeel its oddity, nay, even its absurdity. When, however, we reflect that all we know of a given kind of matter is its properties, we realize thatthe assertion that the matter is still there, but without any of those properties, is not far removed from nonsense.' Compare the same author'sPrinciples of Inorganic Chemistry, English translation, 2d ed. (1904), p. 149 f. Also P. Duhem: 'La Notion de Mixte,' in the Revue dePhilosophie, vol. i, p. 452 ff.

These are the absoluteconceptual foundations, we think, spread beneath the surface of perceptual variety. It is when we come to human lives,that our point of view changes. It is hard to imagine that 'really' our own subjective experiences are only moleculararrangements, even though the molecules be conceived as beings of a psychic kind. A material fact may indeed bedifferent from what we feel it to be, but what sense is there in saying that a feeling, which has no other nature than tobe felt, is not as it is felt? Psychologically considered, our experiences resist conceptual reduction, and our fields ofconsciousness, taken simply as such, remain just what they appear, even though facts of a molecular order shouldprove to be the signals of the appearance. Biography is the concrete form in which all that is is immediately given; theperceptual flux is the authentic stuff of each of our biographies, and yields a perfect effervescence of novelty all thetime. New men and women, books, accidents, events, inventions, enterprises, burst unceasingly upon the world. It isvain to resolve these into ancient elements, or to say that they belong to ancient kinds, so long as no one of them in itsfull individualityever was here before or will ever come again. Men of science and philosophy, the moment they forget their theoreticabstractions, live in their biographies as much as any one else, and believe as naïvely that fact even now is making,and that they themselves, by doing 'original work,' help to determine what the future shall become.I have already compared the live or perceptual order with the conceptual order from this point of view. Conceptionknows no way of explaining save by deducing the identical from the identical, so if the world is to be conceptuallyrationalized no novelty can really come. This is one of the traits in that general bankruptcy of conceptualism, which Ienumerated in Chapter V—conceptualism can name change and growth, but can translate them into no terms of itsown, and is forced to contradict the indestructible sense of life within us by denying that reality grows."},{"pageNumber":1121,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1060 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 46]Page 1060Novelty and the infiniteIt may seem to the youthful student a rather 'far cry' from the question of the possibility of novelty to the 'problem ofthe infinite,' but in the history of speculation, the two problems have been connected. Novelty seems to violatecontinuity; continuity seems to involve 'infinitely' shaded gradation; infinity connects with number; and number withfact in general—for facts have to be numbered. It has thus come to pass that the nonexistence of an infinite numberhas been held to necessitate the finite character of the constitution of fact; and along with this its discontinuousgenesis, or, in other words, its coming into being by discrete increments of novelty however small.Thus we find the problem of the infinite already lying across our path.

Every feature of the universe would on this view have a finitenumerical constitution. Just as atoms, not half-or quarter-atoms are the minimum of matter that can be, and everyfinite amount of matter contains a finite number of atoms, so any amounts of time, space, change, etc., which wemight assume would be composed of a finite number of minimal amounts of time, space, and change.Such a discrete composition is what actually obtains in our perceptual experience. We either perceive nothing, orsomething already there in sensible amount. This fact is what in psychology is known as the law of the 'threshold.'Either your experience is of no content, or it is of a perceptible amount of content or change. Your acquaintance withreality grows literally by buds or drops of perception. Intellectually and on reflection you can divide these intocomponents, but as immediately given, they come totally or not at all.The continuity theoryIf however, we take time and space as concepts, not as perceptual data, we don't well see how they can have thisatomistic constitution. For if the drops or atoms are themselves without duration or extension it is inconceivable thatby adding any number of them together times or spaces should accrue. If, on the other hand, they are minute durationsor extensions, it is impossible to treat them as real minima. Each temporal drop must have a later and an earlier half,each spatial unit a right and a left half, and these halves must themselves have halves, and so on ad infinitum, so thatwith the notion that the constitution of things is continuous and not discrete, that of a divisibility ad"},{"pageNumber":1123,"pageContent":" Page 1062infinitum is inseparably bound up. This infinite divisibility of some facts, coupled with the infinite expansibility ofothers (space, time, and number) has given rise to one of the most obstinate of philosophy's dialectic problems. Letme take up, in as simple a way as I am able to, the problem of the infinite.Zeno's paradoxesThere is a pseudo-problem, 'How can the finite know the infinite?' which has troubled some English heads.1 But onemight as well make a problem of 'How can the fat know the lean?' When we come to treat of knowledge, suchproblems will vanish. The real problem of the infinite began with the famous arguments against motion, of Zeno theEleatic. The school of Pythagoras was pluralistic. 'Things are numbers,' the master had said, meaning apparently thatreality was made of points which one might number.2 Zeno's arguments were meant to show, not that motion couldnot really take place, but that it could not truly be conceived as taking place by the successive occupancy of points. Ifa flying arrow occupies at each point of time a determinate point of space, its motion becomes nothing but a sum ofrests, for it exists not, out of any point; and in the point it does n't move. Motion cannot truly occur as thus discretelyconstituted.Still better known than the 'arrow' is the 'Achilles' paradox. Suppose Achilles to race with a tortoise, and to movetwice as fast as his rival, to whom he gives an inch of head-start. By the time he has completed that inch, or in otherwords advanced to the tortoise's starting point, the tortoise is half an inch ahead of him. While Achilles is traversingthat half inch, the tortoise is traversing a quarter of an inch, etc. So that the successive points occupied by the runnerssimultaneously form a convergent series of distances from the starting point of Achilles. Measured in inches, thesedistances would run as follows:Zeno now assumes that space must be infinitely divisible. But1In H. Calderwood's Philosophy of the Infinite one will find the subordinate difficulties discussed, with almost no consciousness shownof the important ones.2I follow here J. Burnet: Early Greek Philosophers (the chapter on the Pythagoreans), and Paul Tannery: 'Le concept scientifique du continu'in the Revue Philosophique, xx, 385."},{"pageNumber":1124,"pageContent":" Page 1063if so, then the number of points to be occupied cannot all be enumerated in succession, for the series begun above isinterminable. Each time that Achilles gets to the tortoise's last point it is but to find that the tortoise has already movedto a further point; and although the interval between the points quickly grows infinitesimal, it is mathematicallyimpossible that the two racers should reach any one point at the same moment. If Achilles could overtake the tortoise,it would be at the end of two inches; and if his speed were two inches a second, it would be at the end of the firstsecond,1 but the argument shows that he simply cannot overtake the animal. To do so would oblige him to exhaust, bytraversing one by one, the whole of them, a series of points which the law of their formation obliges to come never toan end.Zeno's various arguments were meant to establish the 'Eleatic' doctrine of real being, which was monistic. the 'minimasensibila' of which space, time, motion, and change consist for our perception are not real 'beings,' for they subdividethemselves ad infinitum. The nature of real being is to be entire or continuous. Our perception, being of a hopeless'many,' thus is false.Our own mathematicians have meanwhile constructed what they regard as an adequate continuum, composed ofpoints or numbers. When I speak again of that I shall have occasion to return to the Achilles-fallacy, so called. Atpresent I will pass without transition to the next great historic attack upon the problem of the infinite, which is thesection on the 'Antinomies' in Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason.'Kant's antinomiesKant's views need a few points of preparation, as follows:—1. That real or objective existence must be determinate existence may be regarded as an axiom in ontology. We maybe dim as to just how many stars we see in the Pleiades, or doubtful whose count to believe regarding them; butseeing and belief are subjective affections, and the stars by themselves, we are sure, exist in definite numbers. 'Eventhe hairs of our head are numbered,' we feel1This shows how shallow is that common 'exposure' of Zeno's 'sophism,' which charges it with trying to prove that to overtake thetortoise, Achilles would require an infinitely long time."},{"pageNumber":1125,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1064 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 49]Page 1064certain, though no man shall ever count them.1 Any existent reality, taken in itself, must therefore be countable, and toany group of such realities some definite number must be applicable.2. Kant defines infinity as 'that which can never be completely measured by the successive addition of units'—in otherwords, as that which defies complete enumeration.3. Kant lays it down as axiomatic that if anything is 'given,' as an existent reality, the whole sum of the 'conditions'required to account for it must similarly be given, or have been given. Thus if a cubic yard of space be 'given,' all itsparts must equally be given. If a certain date in past time be real, then the previous dates must also have been real. Ifan effect be given, the whole series of its causes must have been given, etc., etc.But the 'conditions' in these cases defy enumeration: the parts of space are less and less ad infinitum, times and causesform series that are infinitely regressive for our counting, and of no such infinite series can a 'whole' be formed. Anysuch series has a variable value, for the number of its terms is indefinite; whereas the conditions under considerationought, if the 'whole sum of them' be really given, to exist (by the principle, 1, above) in fixed numerical amount.21Of the origin in our-experience of this singularly solid postulate, I will say nothing here.2The contradiction between the infinity in the form of the conditions, and the numerical determinateness implied in the fact of them, wasascribed by Kant to the 'antinomic' form of our experience. His solution of the puzzle was by the way of 'idealism,' and is one of the prettieststrokes in his philosophy. Since the conditions cannot exist in the shape of a totalized amount, it must be, he says, that they do not existindependently or an sich, but only as phenomena, or for us. Indefiniteness of amount is not incompatible with merely phenomenal existence.Actual phenomena, whether conditioned or conditioning, are there for us only in finite amount, as given to perception at any given moment;and the infinite form of them means only that we can go on perceiving, conceiving or imagining more and more about them, world withoutend. It does not mean that what we go on thus to represent shall have been there already by itself, apart from our acts of representation.Experience, for idealism, thus falls into two parts, a phenomenal given part which is finite, and a conditioning infinite part which is not given,but only possible to experience hereafter. Kant distinguishes this second part, as only aufgegeben (or set to us as a task), from the first part asgegeben (or already extant)."},{"pageNumber":1126,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1065 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 49]Page 1065Ambiguity of Kant's statement of the problemSuch was the form of the puzzle of the infinite, as Kant propounded it. The reader will observe a bad ambiguity in thestatement. When he speaks of the 'absolute totality of the synthesis' of the conditions, the words suggest that acompleted collection of them must exist or have existed. When we hear that 'the whole sum of them must be given,'we interpret it to mean that they must be given in the form of a whole sum, whereas all that the logical situationrequires is that no one of them should be lacking, an entirely different demand, and one that can be gratified as well inan infinitely growing as in a terminated series. The same things can always be taken either collectively ordistributively, can be talked of either as 'all,' or as 'each,' or as 'any.' Either statement can be applied equally well towhat exists in finite number; and 'all that is there' will be covered both times. But things which appear under the formof endless series can be talked of only distributively, if we wish to leave none of them out. When we say that 'any,''each,' or 'every' one of Kant's conditions must be fulfilled, we are therefore on impeccable ground, even though theconditions should form a series as endless as that of the whole numbers, to which we are forever able to add one. Butif we say that 'all' must be fulfilled, and imagine 'all' to signify a sum harvested and gathered-in, and represented by anumber, we not only make a requirement utterly uncalled for by the logic of the situation, but we create puzzles andincomprehensibilities that otherwise would not exist, and that may require, to get rid of them again, hypotheses asviolent as Kant's idealism.Renouvier's solutionIn the works of Charles Renouvier, the strongest philosopher of France during the second half of the nineteenthcentury, the problem of the infinite again played a pivotal part. Starting from the principle of the numericaldeterminateness of reality (supra, page 1063)—the 'principle du nombre,' as he called it—and recognizing that theseries of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., leads to no final 'infinite' number, he concluded that such realities as present beings,past events and causes, steps of change and parts of matter, must needs exist in limited amount. This made of him aradical pluralist. Better, he said, admit that being gives itself to us abruptly, that there are first beginnings, absolutenumbers,"},{"pageNumber":1127,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1066 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 50]Page 1066and definite cessations, however intellectually opaque to us they may seem to be, than try to rationalize all thisarbitrariness of fact by working-in explanatory conditions which would involve in every case the self-contradiction ofthings being paid-in and completed, although they are infinite in formal composition.His solution favors noveltyWith these principles, Renouvier could believe in absolute novelties, unmeditated beginnings, gifts, chance, freedom,and acts of faith. Fact, for him, overlapped; conceptual explanation fell short; reality must in the end be beggedpiecemeal, not everlastingly deduced from other reality. This, the empiricist, as distinguished from the rationalistview, is the hypothesis set forth at the end of our last chapter.11I think that Renouvier made mistakes, and I find his whole philosophic manner and apparatus too scholastic. But he was one of thegreatest of philosophic characters, and but for the decisive impression made on me in the seventies by his masterly advocacy ofpluralism, I might never have got free from the monistic superstition under which I had grown up. The present volume, in short, mightnever have been written. This is why, feeling endlessly thankful as I do, I dedicate this text-book to the great Renouvier's memory.Renouvier's works make a very long list. The fundamental one is the Essais de Critique Générale (first edition, 1854 1864, is in four,second edition, 1875, in six volumes). Of his latest opinions Le Personnalisme (1903) gives perhaps the most manageable account; whilethe last chapter of his Esquisse d'une Classification des Systèmes (entitled 'Comment je suis arrivé à ces conclusions') is anautobiographic sketch of his dealings with the problem of the infinite. Derniers entretiens, dictated while dying, at the age of eighty-eight, is a most impressive document, coming as if from a man out of Plutarch."},{"pageNumber":1128,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1067 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 50]Page 1067Chapter XINovelty and the Infinite—The Perceptual ViewKant's and Renouvier's dealings with the infinite are fine examples of the way in which philosophers have alwaysbeen wont to infer matters of fact from conceptual considerations. Real novelty would be a matter of fact; and sowould be the idealistic constitution of experience; but Kant and Renouvier deduce these facts from the purely logicalimpossibility of an infinite number of conditions getting completed. It seems a very short cut to truth; but if the logicholds firm, it may be a fair cut,1 and the possibility obliges us to scrutinize the situation with increasing care.Proceeding so to do, we immediately find that in the class of infinitely conditioned things, we must distinguish twosub-classes, as follows:—1. Things conceived as standing, like space, past time, existing beings.2. Things conceived as growing, like motion, change, activity.The standing infiniteIn the standing class there seems to be no valid objection to admitting both real existence, and a numericalcopiousness demanding infinity for its description. If, for instance, we consider the stars, and assume the number ofthem to be infinite, we need only suppose that to each several term of the endless series 1, 2, 3, 4, n , therecorresponds one star. The numbers, growing endlessly, would then never exceed the stars standing there to receivethem. Each number would find its own star waiting from eternity to be numbered; and this in infinitum, some star thatever was, matching each number that shall be used. As there is no 'all' to the numbers so there need be none to thestars. One cannot well see how the existence of each star should oblige the whole class 'star' to be of one1Let me now say that we shall ourselves conclude that change completed by steps infinite in number is inadmissible. This is hardlyinferring fact from conceptual considerations, it is only concluding that a certain conceptual hypothesis regarding the fact of change willnot work satisfactorily. The field is thus open for any other hypothesis; and the one which we shall adopt is simply that which the face ofperceptual experience suggests."},{"pageNumber":1129,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1068 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 51]Page 1068number rather than of another, or require it to be of any terminated number. What I say here of stars applies to thecomponent parts of space and matter, and to those of past time.1Its pragmatic definitionSo long as we keep taking such facts piecemeal, and talk of them distributively as 'any' or 'each,' the existence of themin infinite form offers no logical difficulty. But there is a psychological tendency to slip from the distributive to thecollective way of talking, and this produces a sort of mental flicker and dazzle out of which the dialectic difficultiesemerge. 'If each condition be there,'—we say, 'then all are there, for there cannot be eaches that do not make an all.'Rightly taken, the phrase 'all are there,' means only that 'not one is absent.' But in the mouths of most people, itsurreptitiously foists in the wholly irrelevant notion of a bounded total.There are other similar confusions. 'How,' it may be asked, in Locke's words, can a 'growing measure' fail to overtakea 'standing bulk'? And standing existence must some time be overtaken by a growing number-series, must be finishedor finite in its numerical determination. But this again foists in the notion of a bound. What is given as 'standing' in thecases under review is not a 'bulk,' but each star, atom, past date or what not; and to call these eaches a 'bulk,' is to begthe very point at issue. But probably the real reason why we object to a standing infinity is the reason that made Hegelspeak of it as the 'false' infinite. It is that the vertiginous chase after ever more space, ever more past time, ever moresubdivision, seems endlessly stupid. What need is there, what use is there,1Past time may offer difficulty to the student as it has to better men! It has terminated in the present moment, paid itself out and made an'amount.' But this amount can be counted in both directions; and in both, one may think it ought to give the same result. If, when countedforward, it came to an end in the present, then when counted backward, it must, we are told, come to a like end in the past. It must havehad a beginning, therefore, and its amount must be finite. The sophism here is gross, and amounts to saying that what has one boundmust have two. The 'end' of the forward counting is the 'beginning' of the backward counting, and is the only beginning logically implied.The ending of a series in no way prejudices the question whether it were beginningless or not; and this applies as well to tracts of time asto the abstract regression which 'negative' numbers form."},{"pageNumber":1130,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1069 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 52]Page 1069for so much? Not that any amount of anything is absolutely too big to be; but that some amounts are too big for ourimagination to wish to caress them. So we fall back with a feeling of relief on some form or other of the finitesthypothesis.1The growing infiniteIf now we turn from static to growing forms of being, we find ourselves confronted by much more serious difficulties.Zeno's and Kant's dialectic holds good wherever, before an end can be reached, a succession of terms, endless bydefinition, must needs have been successively counted out. This is the case with every process of change, howeversmall; with every event which we conceive as unrolling itself continuously. What is continuous must be divisible adinfinitum; and from division to division here you cannot proceed by addition (or by what Kant calls the successivesynthesis of units) and touch a farther limit. You can indeed define what the limit ought to be, but you cannot reach itby this process. That Achilles should occupy in succession 'all' the points in a single continuous inch of space, is asinadmissible a conception as that he should count the series of whole numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., to infinity and reach anend. The terms are not 'enumerable' in that order; and the order it is that makes the whole difficulty. An infinite'regression' like the rearward perspective of time offers no such contradiction, for it comes not in that order. Its 'end' iswhat we start with; and each successive note 'more' which our imagination has to add, ad infinitum, is thought of asalready having been paid in and not as having yet to be paid before the end can be attained. Starting with our end, wehave to wait for nothing. The infinity here is of the 'standing' variety. It is, in the word of Kant's pun, gegeben, notaufgegeben: in the other case, of a continuous process to be1The reader will note how emphatically in all this discussion, I am insisting on the distributive or piecemeal point of view. Thedistributive is identical with the pluralistic, as the collective is with the monistic conception. We shall, I think, perceive more and moreclearly as this book proceeds, that piecemeal existence is independent of complete collectibility, and that some facts, at any rate, existonly distributively, or in form of a set of eaches which (even if in infinite number) need not in any intelligible sense either experiencethemselves, or get experienced by anything else, as members of an All."},{"pageNumber":1131,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1070 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 52]Page 1070traversed, it is on the contrary aufgegeben: it is a task—not only for our philosophic imagination, but for any realagent who might try physically to compass the entire performance. Such an agent is bound by logic to find always aremainder, something ever yet to be paid, like the balance due on a debt with even the interest of which we do notcatch up.The growing infinite must be treated as discontinuous'Infinitum in actu pertransiri nequit,' said scholasticism; and every continuous quantum to be gradually traversed isconceived as such an infinite. The quickest way to avoid the contradiction would seem to be to give up thatconception, and to treat real processes of change no longer as being continuous, but as taking place by finite notinfinitesimal steps, like the successive drops by which a cask of water is filled, when whole drops fall into it at once ornothing. This is the radically pluralist, empiricist, or perceptualist position, which I characterized in speaking ofRenouvier (above, pages 1065 1066). We shall have to end by adopting it in principle ourselves, qualifying it so as tofit it closely to perceptual experience.ObjectionsMeanwhile we are challenged by a certain school of critics who think that what in mathematics is called 'the newinfinite' has quashed the old antinomies, and who treat anyone whom the notion of a completed infinite in any formstill bothers, as a very naïf person. Naïf though I am in mathematics, I must, notwithstanding the dryness of thesubject, add a word in rebuttal of these criticisms, some of which, as repeated by novices, tend decidedly towardsmystification.(1) The number-continuumThe 'new infinite' and the 'number-continuum' are outgrowths of a general attempt to accomplish what has been calledthe 'arithmetization' ('ariqmèc meaning number) of all quantity. Certain quanta (grades of intensity or otherdifference, amounts of space) have until recently been supposed to be immediate data of perceptive sensibility or'intuition'; but philosophical mathematicians have now succeeded in getting a conceptual equivalent for them in theshape of collections of numbers created by interpolation between one another indefinitely. We can halve any line inspace, and halve its halves and so on. But between the cuts thus made and numbered, room is left for"},{"pageNumber":1132,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1071 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 53]Page 1071infinite others created by using 3 as a divisor, for infinite others still by using 5, 7, etc., until all possible 'rational'divisions of the line shall have been made. Between these it is now shown that interpolation of cuts numbered'irrationally' is still possible ad infinitum, and that with these the line at last gets filled full, its continuity now beingwholly translated into these numbered cuts, and their number being infinite. 'Of the celebrated formula that continuitymeans ''unity in multiplicity,\" the multiplicity alone subsists, the unity disappears,'1—as indeed it does in allconceptual translations —and the original intuition of the line's extent gets treated, from the mathematical point ofview, as a 'mass of uncriticized prejudice' by Russell, or sneered at by Cantor as a 'kind of religious dogma.'2(2) The 'new infinite'So much for the number-continuum. As for 'the new infinite': that means only a new definition of infinity. If wecompare the indefinitely-growing number-series, 1, 2, 3, 4, --- n, --- in its entirety, with any component part of it, like'even' numbers, 'prime' numbers, or 'square' numbers, we are confronted with a paradox. No one of the parts, thusnamed, of the number-series, is equal to the whole collectively taken; yet any one of them is 'similar' to the whole, inthe sense that you can set up a one-to-one relation between each of its elements and each element of the whole, sothat part and whole prove to be of what logicians call the same 'class,' numerically. Thus, in spite of the fact that evennumbers, prime numbers, and square numbers are much fewer and rarer than numbers in general, and only form apart of numbers überhaupt they appear to be equally copious for purposes of counting. The terms of each such partialseries can be numbered by using the natural integers in succession. There is, for instance, a first prime, a secondprime, etc., ad infinitum; and queerer-sounding still, since every integer, odd or even, can be doubled, it would seemthat the even numbers thus produced cannot in the nature of things be less multitudinous than that series of both oddand even numbers of which the whole natural series consists.The new infinite paradoxicalThese paradoxical consequences result, as one sees imme-1H.

They werelong treated as a reduction ad absurdum of the notion that such a variable series spells infinity in act, or can ever betranslated into standing or collective form.1 But contemporary mathematicians have taken the bull by the horns.Instead of treating such paradoxical properties of indefinitely growing series as reductiones ad absurdum, they haveturned them into the proper definition of infinite classes of things. Any class is now called infinite if its parts arenumerically similar to itself. If its parts are numerically dissimilar, it is finite. This definition now separates theconception of the class of finite from that of infinite objects.'Transfinite numbers'Next, certain concepts, called 'transfinite numbers,' are now created by definition. They are decreed to belong to theinfinite class, and yet not to be formed by adding one to one ad infinitum, but rather to be postulated out-right ascoming after each and all of the numbers formed by such addition.2 Cantor gives the name of 'Omega' to the lowest ofthese possible transfinite numbers. It would, for instance, be the number of the point at which Achilles overtakes thetortoise—if he does overtake him—by exhausting all the intervening points successively. Or it would be the number ofthe stars, in case their counting could not terminate. Or again it would be the number of miles away at which parallellines meet—if they do meet. It is, in short, a 'limit' to the whole class of numbers that grow one by one, and like otherlimits,1The fact that, taken distributively, or paired each to each, the terms in one endlessly growing series should be made a match for those inanother (or 'similar' to them) is quite compatible with the two series being collectively of vastly unequal amounts. You need only makethe steps of difference, or distances, between the terms much longer in one series than in the other, to get numerically similar multitudes,with greatly unequal magnitudes of content. Moreover the moment either series should stop growing, the 'similarity' would cease to exist.2The class of all numbers that 'come before the first transfinite' is a definitely limited conception, provided we take the numbers as eaches orany, for then any one and every of them will have by definition to come before the transfinite number comes—even though they form nowhole and there be no last one of them, and though the transfinite have no immediate predecessor. The transfinite is, in a word, not an ordinalconception, at least it does not continue the order of entire numbers."},{"pageNumber":1134,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1073 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 54]Page 1073it proves a useful conceptual bridge for passing us from one range of facts to another.Their uses and defectsThe first sort of fact we pass to with its help is the number of the number-continuum or point-continuum describedabove (page 1070) as generated by infinitely repeated subdivision. The making of the subdivisions is an infinitelygrowing process; but the number of subdivisions that can be made has for its limit the transfinite number Omega justimagined and defined; thus is a growing assimilated to a standing multitude; thus is a number that is variablepractically equated (by the process of passing to the limit) with one that is fixed; thus do we circumvent the law ofindefinite addition, or division which previously was the only way in which infinity was constructible, and reach aconstant infinite at a bound. This infinite number may now be substituted for any continuous finite quantum, howeversmall the latter may perceptually appear to be.When I spoke of my 'mystification,' just now, I had partly in mind the contemptuous way in which some enthusiastsfor the 'new infinite' treat those who still cling to the superstition that 'the whole is greater than the part.' Because anypoint whatever in an imaginary inch is now conceivable as being matched by some point in a quarter-inch or half-inch, this numerical 'similarity' of the different quanta, taken point-wise, is treated as if it signified that half-inches,quarter-inches, and inches are mathematically identical things anyhow, and that their differences are facts which wemay scientifically neglect. I may misunderstand the newest expounders of Zeno's famous 'sophism,' but what they sayseems to me virtually to be equivalent to this.Russell's solution of Zeno's paradox by their meansMr. Bertrand Russell (whom I do not accuse of mystification, for Heaven knows he tries to make things clear!) treatsthe Achilles-puzzle as if the difficulty lay only in seeing how the paths traversed by the two runners (measured afterthe race is run, and assumed then to consist of nothing but points of position coincident with points upon a commonscale of time) should have the same time-measure if they be not themselves of the same length. But the two paths areof different lengths; for owing to the tortoise's head-start, the tortoise's path is only a part of"},{"pageNumber":1135,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1074 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 54]Page 1074the path of Achilles. How, then, if time-points are to be the medium of measurement, can the longer path not take thelonger time?The remedy, for Mr. Russell, if I rightly understand him, lies in noting that the sets of points in question are conceivedas being infinitely numerous in both paths, and that where infinite multitudes are in question, to say that the whole isgreater than the part is false. For each and every point traversed by the tortoise there is one point traversed byAchilles, at the corresponding point of time; and the exact correspondence, point by point, of either one of the threesets of points with both the others, makes of them similar and equally copious sets from the numerical point of view.There is thus no recurrent 'remainder' of the tortoise's head-start with which Achilles cannot catch up, which he canreduce indefinitely, but cannot annul. The books balance to the end. The last point in Achilles's path, the last point inthe tortoise's, and the last time-instant in the race are terms which mathematically coincide. With this, which seems tobe Mr. Russell's way of analyzing the situation, the puzzle is supposed to disappear.1The solution criticizedIt seems to me however that Mr. Russell's statements dodge the real difficulty, which concerns the 'growing' variety ofinfinity exclusively, and not the 'standing' variety, which is all that he envisages when he assumes the race already tohave been run and thinks that the only problem that remains is that of numerically equating the paths. The realdifficulty may almost be called physical, for it attends the process of formation of the paths. Moreover, two paths arenot needed—that of either runner alone, or even the lapse of empty time, involves the difficulty, which is that oftouching a goal when an interval needing to be traversed first keeps permanently reproducing itself and getting in yourway. Of course the same quantum can be produced in various manners. This page which I am now painfully writing,letter after letter, will be printed at a single stroke. God, as the1Mr. Russell's own statements of the puzzle as well as of the remedy are too technical to be followed verbatim in a book like this. As hefinds it necessary to paraphrase the puzzle, so I find it convenient to paraphrase him, sincerely hoping that no injustice has been done."},{"pageNumber":1136,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1075 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 54]Page 1075orthodox believe, created the space-continuum, with its infinite parts already standing in it, by an instantaneous fiat.Past time now stands in infinite perspective, and may conceivably have been created so, as Kant imagined, for ourretrospection only, and all at once. 'Omega' was created by a single decree, a single act of definition in Prof. Cantor'smind. But whoso actually traverses a continuum, can do so by no process continuous in the mathematical sense. Be itshort or long, each point must be occupied in its due order of succession; and if the points are necessarily infinite,their end cannot be reached, for the 'remainder,' in this kind of process, is just what one cannot 'neglect.' 'Enumeration'is, in short, the sole possible method of occupation of the series of positions implied in the famous race; and when Mr.Russell solves the puzzle by saying as he does, that 'the definition of whole and part without enumeration is the key tothe whole mystery,'1 he seems to me deliberately to throw away his case.21The Philosophy of Mathematics, i, 361.—Mr. Russell gives a Tristram Shandy paradox as a counterpart to the Achilles. Since it took T.S. (according to Sterne) two years to write the history of the first two days of his life, common sense would conclude that at that rate thelife never could be written. But Mr. Russell proves the contrary; for, as days and years have no last term, and the nth day is written in thenth year, any assigned day will be written about, and no part of the life remain unwritten. But Mr. Russell's proof cannot be applied tothe real world without the physical hypothesis which he expresses by saying: 'If Tristram Shandy lives forever, and does not weary of histask.' In all real cases of continuous change a similarly absurd hypothesis must be made: the agent of the change must live forever, in thesense of outliving an endless set of points of time, and 'not wearying' of his impossible task.2Being almost blind mathematically and logically, I feel considerable shyness in differing from such superior minds, yet what can one do butfollow one's own dim light? The literature of the new infinite is so technical that it is impossible to cite details of it in a non-mathematicalwork like this. Students who are interested should consult the tables of contents of B. Russell's Philosophy of Mathematics, of L. Couturat'sInfini Mathématique, or his Principes des Mathématiques.

Irrelevant though they be to facts the 'conditions' of which are of the'standing' sort, the criticisms of Leibnitz, Kant, Cauchy, Renouvier, Evellin and others, apply legitimately to all casesof supposedly continuous growth or change. The 'conditions' here have to be fulfilled seriatim; and if the series whichthey form were endless, its limit, if 'successive synthesis' were the only way of reaching it, could simply not bereached. Either we must stomach logical contradiction, therefore, in these cases; or we must admit that the limit isreached in these successive cases by finite and perceptible units of approach—drops, buds, steps, or whatever weplease to term them, of change, coming wholly when they do come, or coming not at all. Such seems to be the natureof concrete experience, which changes always by sensible amounts, or stays unchanged. The infinite character we findin it is woven into it by our later conception indefinitely repeating the act of subdividing any given amount supposed.The facts do not resist the subsequent conceptual treatment; but we need not believe that the treatment necessarilyreproduces the operation by which they were originally brought into existence.I. Conceptual transformation of perceptual experience turns the infinite into a problemThe antinomy of mathematically continuous growth is thus but one more of those many ways in which our conceptualtransformation of perceptual experience makes it less comprehensible than ever. That being should immediately andby finite quantities add itself to being, may indeed be something which an onlooking intellect fails to understand; butthat being should be identified with the consummation of an endless chain of units (such as 'points'), no one of whichcontains any amount whatever of the being (such as(Footnote continued from previous page)Aristotelian Soc.

Better accept, as Renouvier says, the opaquely given data of perception, than concepts inwardly absurd.12. It leaves the problem of novelty where it wasSo much for the 'problem of the infinite,' and for the interpretation of continuous change by the new definition ofinfinity. We find that the picture of a reality changing by steps finite in number and discrete, remains quite asacceptable to our understanding and as congenial to our imagination as before; so, after these dry and barren chapters,we take up our main topic of inquiry just where we had laid it down. Does reality grow by abrupt increments ofnovelty, or not? The contrast between discontinuity and continuity now confronts us in another form. Themathematical definition of continuous quantity as 'that between any two elements or terms of which there is anotherterm' is directly opposed to the more empirical or perceptual notion that anything is continuous when its parts appearas immediate next neighbors, with absolutely nothing between. Our business lies hereafter with the perceptual1The point-continuum illustrates beautifully my complaint that the intellectualist method turns the flowing into the static and discrete.The buds or steps of process which perception accepts as primal gifts of being, correspond logically to the 'infinitesimals' (minutestquanta of motion, change or what not) of which the latest mathematics is supposed to have got rid. Mr. Russell accordingly finds himselfobliged, just like Zeno, to treat motion as an unreality: 'Weierstrass,' he says, 'by strictly banishing all infinitesimals has at last shownthat we live in an unchanging world, and that the arrow, at every moment of its flight, is truly at rest' (op. cit., p. 347). 'We must entirelyreject the notion of a state of motion,' he says elsewhere; 'motion consists merely in the occupation of different places at different times. There is no transition from place to place, no consecutive moment, or consecutive position, no such thing as velocity except in the senseof a real number which is the limit of a certain set of quotients' (p. 473). The mathematical 'continuum,' so called, becomes thus anabsolute discontinuum in any physical or experiential sense. Extremes meet; and although Russell and Zeno agree in denying perceptualmotion, for the one a pure unity, for the other a pure multiplicity takes its place. It is probable that Russell's denial of change, etc. ismeant to apply only to the mathematical world. It would be unfair to charge him with writing metaphysics in these passages, although hegives no warning that this may not be the case."},{"pageNumber":1139,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1078 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 56]Page 1078account, but before we settle definitively to its discussion, another classic problem of philosophy had better be got outof the way. This is the 'problem of causation.'"},{"pageNumber":1140,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1079 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 57]Page 1079Chapter XIINovelty and Causation—The Conceptual ViewThe 'principle of causality'If reality changes by finite sensible steps, the question whether the bits of it that come are radically new, remainsunsettled still. Remember our situation at the end of Chapter III. Being überhaupt or at large, we there found to beundeduceable. For our intellect it remains a casual and contingent quantum that is simply found or begged. May it bebegged bit by bit, as it adds itself? Or must we beg it only once, by assuming it either to be eternal or to have come inan instant that co-implicated all the rest of time? Did or did not 'the first morning of creation write what the last dawnof reckoning shall read? With these questions monism and pluralism stand face to face again. The classic obstacle topluralism has always been what is known as the 'principle of causality.' This principle has been taken to mean that theeffect in some way already exists in the cause. If this be so, the effect cannot be absolutely novel, and in no radicalsense can pluralism be true.We must therefore review the facts of causation. I take them in conceptual translation before considering them inperceptual form. The first definite inquiry into causes was made by Aristotle.1Aristotle on causationThe 'why' of anything, he said, is furnished by four principles: the material cause of it (as when bronze makes astatue); the formal cause (as when the ratio of two to one makes an octave); the efficient cause (as when a fathermakes a child) and the final cause (as when one exercises for the sake of health). Christian philosophy adopted thefour causes; but what one generally means by the cause of anything is its 'efficient' cause, and in what immediatelyfollows I shall speak of that alone.Scholasticism on the efficient causeAn efficient cause is scholastically defined as 'that which produces something else by a real activity proceeding fromitself.' This is unquestionably the view of common sense; and1Book 2, or book 5, chap. ii of his Metaphysics, or chap. iii of his Physics, give what is essential in his views."},{"pageNumber":1141,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1080 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 57]Page 1080scholasticism is only common sense grown quite articulate. Passing over the many classes of efficient cause whichscholastic philosophy specifies, I will enumerate three important sub-principles it is supposed to follow from theabove definition. Thus: 1. No effect can come into being without a cause. This may be verbally taken; but if, avoidingthe word effect, it be taken in the sense that nothing can happen without a cause, it is the famous 'principle ofcausality' which, when combined with the next two principles, is supposed to establish the block-universe, and torender the pluralistic hypothesis absurd.2. The effect is always proportionate to the cause, and the cause to the effect.3. Whatever is in the effect must in some way, whether formally, virtually, or eminently, have been also in the cause.('Formally' here means that the cause resembles the effect, as when one motion causes another motion; virtually meansthat the cause somehow involves that effect, without resembling it, as when an artist caues a statue but possesses nothimself its beauty; 'eminently' means that the cause, though unlike the effect, is superior to it in perfection, as when aman overcomes a lion's strength by greater cunning.)Nemo dat quod non habet is the real principle from which the causal philosophy flows; and the proposition causaaquat effectum practically sums up the whole of it.1It is plain that each moment of the universe must contain all the causes of which the next moment contains effects, orto put it with extreme concision, it is plain that each moment in its totality causes the next moment.2 But if the maxim1Read for a concise statement of the school-doctrine of causation the account in J. Rickaby: General Metaphysics, book 2, chap. iii. Iomit from my text various subordinate maxims which have played a great part in causal philosophy, as 'The cause of a cause is the causeof its effects'; 'The same causes produce the same effects'; 'Causes act only when present'; 'A cause must exist before it can act,' etc.2This notion follows also from the consideration of conditioning circumstances being at bottom as indispensable as causes for producingeffects. 'The cause, philosophically speaking, is the sum total of the conditions positive and negative,' says J. S. Mill (Logic, 8th edition, i,383). This is equivalent to the entire state of the universe at the moment that precedes the effect. But neither is the 'effect' in that case the onefragmentary event which our atten-(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":1142,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1081 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 58]Page 1081holds firm that quidquid est in effectu debet esse prius aliquo modo in causa, it follows that the next moment cancontain nothing genuinely original, and that the novelty that appears to leak into our lives so unremittingly, must be anillusion, ascribable to the shallowness of the perceptual point of view.Scholasticism always respected common sense, and in this case escaped the frank denial of all genuine novelty by thevague qualification 'aliquo modo.' This allowed the effect also to differ, aliquo modo, from its cause. But conceptualnecessities have ruled the situation and have ended, as usual, by driving nature and perception to the wall. A causeand its effect are two numerically discrete concepts, and yet in some inscrutable way the former must 'produce' thelatter. How can it intelligibly do so, save by already hiding the latter in itself? Numerically two, cause and effect mustbe generically one, in spite of the perceptual appearances; and causation changes thus from a concretely experiencedrelation between differents into one between similars abstractly thought of as more real.1OccasionalismThe overthrow of perception by conception took a long time to complete itself in this field. The first step was thetheory of 'occasionalism,' to which Descartes led the way by his doctrine that mental and physical substance, the oneconsisting purely of thought, the other purely of extension, were absolutely dissimilar. If this were so, any such causalintercourse as we instinctively perceive between mind and body ceased to be rational. For thinkers of that age,(Footnote continued from previous page)tion first abstracted under that name. It is that fragment, along with all its concomitants—or in other words it is the entire state of theuniverse at the second moment desired.1Sir William Hamilton expresses this very compactly: 'What is the law of Causality? Simply this,—that when an object is presentedphenomenally as commencing, we cannot but suppose that the complement (i.e. the amount) of existence, which it now contains, haspreviously been;—in other words, that all that we at present know as an effect must previously have existed in its causes; though what thesecauses are we may perhaps be altogether unable to surmise.' (End of Lecture 39 of the Metaphysics.) The cause becomes a reason, the effect aconsequence; and since logical consequence follows only from the same to the same, the older vaguer causation-philosophy develops into thesharp rationalistic dogma that cause and effect are two names for one persistent being, and that if the successive moments of the universe becausally connected, no genuine novelty leaks in."},{"pageNumber":1143,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1082 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 59]Page 1082'God' was the great solvent of absurdities. He could get over every contradiction. Consequently Descartes' disciplesRégis and Cordemoy, and especially Geulincx, denied the fact of psychological interaction altogether. God, accordingto them, immediately caused the changes in our mind of which events in our body, and those in our body of whichevents in our mind, appear to be the causes, but of which they are in reality only the signals or occasions.LeibnitzLeibnitz took the next step forward in quenching the claim to truth of our perceptions. He freed God from the duty oflending all this hourly assistance, by supposing Him to have decreed on the day of creation that the changes in ourseveral minds should coincide with those in our several bodies, after the manner in which clocks, wound up on thesame day, thereafter keep time with one another. With this 'preestablished harmony' so-called, the conceptualtranslation of the immediate given, with its never failing result of negating both activity and continuity, is complete.Instead of the dramatic flux of personal life, a bare 'one to one correspondence' between the terms of two causallyunconnected series is set up. God is the sole cause of anything, and the cause of everything at once. The theory is asmonistic as the rationalist heart can desire, and of course novelty would be impossible if it were true.HumeDavid Hume made the next step in discrediting commonsense causation. In the chapters on 'the idea of necessaryconnection' both in his 'Treatise on Human Nature,' and in his 'Essays,' he sought for a positive picture of the 'efficacyof the power' which causes are assumed to exert, and failed to find it. He shows that neither in the physical nor in themental world can we abstract or isolate the 'energy' transmitted from causes to effects. This is as true of perception asit is of imagination. 'All ideas are derived from and represent impressions. We never have any impression thatcontains any power or efficacy. We never therefore have any idea of power.' 'We never can by our utmost scrutinydiscover anything but one event following another; without being able to comprehend any force or power, by whichthe cause operates, or any connection between it and its supposed effect. The necessary conclusion seems to be thatwe have no idea of con-"},{"pageNumber":1144,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1083 hl[01 03 2011 21 20 59]Page 1083nection or power at all, and that these words are absolutely without any meaning, when employed either inphilosophical reasonings or in common life.' 'Nothing is more evident than that the mind cannot form such an idea oftwo objects as to conceive any connection between them, or comprehend distinctly that power or efficacy by whichthey are united.'The pseudo-idea of a connection which we have, Hume then goes on to show, is nothing but the misinterpretation of amental custom. When we have often experienced the same sequence of events, 'we are carried by habit, upon theappearance of the first one, to expect its usual attendant, and to believe that it will exist. This customary transition ofthe imagination is the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea of power or necessary connection.Nothing farther is in the case.' 'A cause is an object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it that theidea of the one determines the idea of the other.'Nothing could be more essentially pluralistic than the elements of Hume's philosophy. He makes events rattle againsttheir neighbors as drily as if they were dice in a box. He might with perfect consistency have believed in realnovelties, and upheld freewill. But I said awhile ago that most empiricists had been half-hearted; and Hume wasperhaps the most half-hearted of the lot. In his essay 'on liberty and necessity,' he insists that the sequences which weexperience, though between events absolutely disconnected, are yet absolutely uniform, and that nothing genuinelynew can flower out of our lives.Criticism of HumeThe reader will recognize in Hume's famous pages a fresh example of the way in which conceptual translationsalways maltreat fact. Perceptually or concretely (as we shall notice in more detail later) causation names the manner inwhich some fields of consciousness introduce other fields. It is but one of the forms in which experience appears as acontinuous flow. Our names show how successfully we can discriminate within the flow. But the conceptualist rule isto suppose that where there is a separate name there ought to be a fact as separate; and Hume, following this rule, andfinding no such fact corresponding to the word 'power,' concludes that the word is meaningless. By this rule every"},{"pageNumber":1145,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1084 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 00]Page 1084conjunction and preposition in human speech is meaningless—in, on, of, with, but, and, if, are as meaningless as for,and because. The truth is that neither the elements of fact nor the meanings of our words are separable as the wordsare. The original form in which fact comes is the perceptual durcheinander, holding terms as well as relations insolution, or interfused and cemented. Our reflective mind abstracts divers aspects in the muchness, as a man bylooking through a tube may limit his attention to one part after another of a land-scape. But abstraction is notinsulation; and it no more breaks reality than the tube breaks the landscape. Concepts are notes, views taken onreality,1 not pieces of it, as bricks are of a house. Causal activity, in short, may play its part in growing fact, eventhough no substantive 'impression' of it should stand out by itself. Hume's assumption that any factor of reality must beseparable, leads to his preposterous view, that no relation can be real. 'All events,' he writes, 'seem entirely loose andseparate. One event follows another, but we never can observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but neverconnected.' Nothing, in short, belongs with anything else. Thus does the intellectualist method pulverize perceptionand triumph over life. Kant and his successors all espoused Hume's opinion that the immediately given is adisconnected 'manifold.' But unwilling simply to accept the manifold, as Hume did, they invoked a superior agent inthe shape of what Kant called the 'transcendental ego of apperception' to patch its bits together by synthetic'categories.' Among these categories Kant inscribes that of 'causality,' and in many quarters he passes for a repairer ofthe havoc that Hume made.KantHis chapter on Cause2 is the most confusedly written part of his famous Critique, and its meaning is often hard tocatch. As I understand his text, he leaves things just where Hume did, save that where Hume says 'habit' he says 'rule.'They both cancel the notion that phenomena called causal ever exert 'power,' or that a single case would ever havesuggested cause and effect. In other words Kant contradicts common sense as much as Hume does and, like Hume,translates1These expressions are Bergson's.2Entitled 'The Second Analogy of Experience,' it begins on page 232 of the second edition of his Critique of Pure Reason."},{"pageNumber":1146,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1085 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 00]Page 1085causation into mere time-succession; only, whereas the order in time was essentially 'loose' for Hume and onlysubjectively uniform, Kant calls its uniformity 'objective as obtaining in conformity to a law, which our Sinnlichkeitreceives from our Verstand.' Non-causal sequences can be reversed; causal ones follow in conformity to rule.1The word Verstand in Kant's account must not be taken as if the rule it is supposed to set to sensation made usunderstand things any better. It is a brute rule of sequence which reveals no 'tie.' The non-rationality of such a'category' leaves it worthless for purposes of insight. It removes dynamic causation and substitutes no otherexplanation for the sequences found. It yields external descriptions only, and assimilates all cases to those where wediscover no reason for the law ascertained.PositivismOur 'laws of nature' do indeed in large part enumerate bare coexistences and successions. Yellowness and malleabilitycoexist in gold; redness succeeds on boiling in lobsters; coagulation in eggs; and to him who asks for the Why of theseuniformities, science only replies: 'Not yet'! Meanwhile the laws are potent for prediction, and many writers onscience tell us that this is all we can demand. To explain, according to the way of thinking called positivistic, is onlyto substitute wider or more familiar, for narrower or less familiar laws, and the laws at their widest only expressuniformities empirically found. Why does the pump suck up water? Because the air keeps pressing it into the tube.Why does the air press in? Because the earth attracts it. Why does the earth1Kant's whole notion of a 'rule' is inconstruable by me. What or whom does the rule bind? If it binds the phenomenon that follows (the'effect') we fall back into the popular dynamic view, and any single case would exhibit causal action, even were there no other cases inthe world.—Or does it bind the observer of the single case? But his own sensations of sequence are what bind him. Be a sequence causalor non-causal, if it is sensible, he cannot turn it backwards as he can his ideas. Or does the rule bind future sequences and determinethem to follow in the same order which the first sequence observed? Since it obviously does not do this when the observer judgeswrongly that the first sequence is causal, all we can say is that it is a rule whereby his expectations of uniformity follow his causaljudgments, be these latter true or false. But wherein would this differ from the human position? Kant, in short, flounders, and in notruthful sense can one keep repeating that he has 'refuted Hume.'"},{"pageNumber":1147,"pageContent":" Page 1086attract it? Because it attracts everything—such attraction being in the end only a more universal sort of fact. Laws,according to their view, only generalize facts, they do not connect them in any intimate sense.1Deductive theories of causationAgainst this purely inductive way of treating causal sequences, a more deductive interpretation has recently beenurged. If the later member of a succession could be deduced by logic from the earlier member, in the particularsequence the 'tie' would be unmistakable. But logical ties carry us only from sames to sames; so this last phase ofscientific method is at bottom only the scholastic principle of Causa aquat effectum, brought into sharper focus andillustrated more concretely. It is thoroughly monistic in its aims, and if it could be worked out in detail it would turnthe real world into the procession of an eternal identity, with the appearances, of which we are perceptually conscious,occurring as a sort of by-product to which no 'scientific' importance should be attached.2 In any case no real growthand no real novelty could effect an entrance into life.31For expressions of this view the student may consult J. S. Mill's Logic, book 3, chap. xii; W. S. Jevons's Principles of Science, book 6;J. Venn's Empirical Logic, chap. xxi, and K. Pearson's Grammar of Science, chap. iii.2'Consciousness,' writes M. Couturat, to cite a handy expression of this mode of thought, 'is properly speaking, the realm of the unreal. Whatremains in our subjective consciousness, after all objective facts have been projected and located in space and time, is the rubbish andresiduum of the construction of the universe, the formless mass of images that were unable to enter into the system of nature and put on thegarment of reality' (Revue de Métaphysique, etc., v, 244).3I avoid amplifying this conception of cause and effect. An immense number of causal facts can indeed be explained satisfactorily byassuming that the effect is only a later position of the cause; and for the remainder we can fall back on the aliquo modo which gave suchcomfort in the past. Such an interpretation of nature would, of course, relegate variety, activity, and novelty to the limbo of illusions, as fastas it succeeded in making its static concepts cancel living facts. It is hard to be sincere, however, in following the conceptual methodruthlessly; and of the writers who think that in science causality must mean identity, some willingly allow that all such scientific explanationis more or less artificial, that identical 'molecules' and 'atoms' are like identical 'pounds' and 'yards,' only pegs in a conceptual arrangement forhanging percepts on in 'one to one relations,' so as to predict facts in 'elegant' or expeditious ways. This is the view of the conceptual universewhich our own discussion has insisted on; and, taking scientific logic in this way, no harm is(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":1148,"pageContent":" Page 1087Summary and conclusionThis negation of real novelty seems to be the upshot of the conceptualist philosophy of causation. This is why I calledit on page 1079 the classic obstacle to the acceptance of pluralism's additive world. The principle of causality beginsas a hybrid between common sense and intellectualism:—what actively produces an effect, it says, must 'in some way'contain the 'power' of it already. But as nothing corresponding to the concept of power can be insulated, the activity-feature of the sequence erelong gets suppressed, and the vague latency, supposed to exist aliquo modo in the causalphenomenon, of the effect about to be produced, is developed into a static relation of identity between two conceptswhich the mind substitutes for the percepts between which the causal tie originally was found.1The resultant state of 'enlightened opinion' about cause, is, as I have called it before, confused and unsatisfactory. Fewphilosophers hold radically to the identity view. The view of the logicians of science is easier to believe but not easierto believe metaphysically, for it violates instinct almost as strongly. Mathematicians make use, to connect the variousinterdependencies of quantities, of the general concept of function. That A is a function of B (A equals B) means thatwith(Footnote continued from previous page)done. Almost no one is radical in using scientific logic metaphysically. Readers wishing for more discussion of the monistic view ofcause, may consult G. H. Lewes: Problems of Life and Mind, problem 5, chap. iii; A. Riehl: Der philosophische Kriticismus (1879), 2terAbsn., Kap. 2; G. Heymans: Die Gesetze u. Elemente d. wissenschaftlichen Denkens, par. 83 85. Compare also B. P. Bowne:Metaphysics, revised edition, part i, chap. iv. Perhaps the most instructive general discussion of causation is that in C. Sigwart: Logic, 2dedition, par. 73. Chap. v of book 3 in J. S. Mill's Logic may be called classical.1I omit saying anything in my text about 'energetics.' Popular writers often appear to think that 'science' has demonstrated a monisticprinciple called 'energy,' which they connect with activity on the one hand and with quantity on the other. So far as I understand this difficultsubject, 'energy' is not a principle at all, still less an active one. It is only a collective name for certain amounts of immediate perceptualreality, when such reality is measured in definite ways that allow its changes to be written so as to get constant sums. It is not an ontologicaltheory at all, but a magnificent economic schematic device for keeping account of the functional variations of the surface phenomena. It isevidently a case of 'non fingo hypotheses,' and since it tolerates perceptual reality, it ought to be regarded as neutral in our causal debate."},{"pageNumber":1149,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1088 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 02]Page 1088every alteration in the value of A, an alteration in that of B is always connected. If we generalize so as also to includequalitative dependencies, we can conceive the universe as consisting of nothing but elements with functional relationsbetween them; and science has then for its sole task the listing of the elements and the describing in the simplestpossible terms the functional 'relations.'1 Changes, in short, occur, and ring throughout phenomena, but neitherreasons, nor activities in the sense of agencies, have any place in this world of scientific logic, which compared withthe world of common sense, is so abstract as to be quite spectral, and merits the appellation (so often quoted from Mr.Bradley) of 'an unearthly ballet of bloodless categories.'1W.

'Le sens de la vie qui s'indigne de tant de discours,' awakens in them and snaps its fingers at the 'critical' view.The present writer has also just called the critical view an incomplete abstraction. But its 'functional laws' andschematisms are splendidly useful, and its negations are true oftener than is commonly supposed. We feel as if our'will' immediately moved our members, and we ignore the braincells whose activity that will must first arouse; wethink we cause the bell-ring, but we only close a contact and the battery in the cellar rings the bell; we think a certainstar's light is the cause of our now seeing it, but ether-waves are the causes, and the star may have been extinguishedlong ago. We call the 'draft,' the cause of our 'cold'; but without co-operant microbes the draft could do no harm. Millsays that causes must be unconditional antecedents, and Venn that they must be 'close' ones. In nature's numeroussuccessions so many links are hidden, that we seldom know exactly which antecedent is unconditional or which isclose. Often the cause which we name only fits some other cause for producing the phenomenon; and things, as Millsays, are frequently then most active when we assume them to be acted upon.This vast amount of error in our instinctive perceptions of causal activity encourages the conceptualist view. A stepfarther, and we suspect that to suppose causal activity anywhere may be a blunder, and that only consecutions andjuxtapositions can be real. Such sweeping scepticism is, however, quite uncalled for. Other parts of experience exposeus to error, yet we do not say that in them is no truth.

It exists elsewhere; and the problem is to place it rightly. It isthe same with all other illusions of sense.There is doubtless somewhere an original perceptual experience of the kind of thing we mean by causation, and thatkind of thing we locate in various other places, rightly or wrongly as the case may be. Where now is the typicalexperience originally got?The perceptual experience of causationEvidently it is got in our own personal activity-situations. In all of these what we feel is that a previous field of'consciousness' containing (in the midst of its complexity) the idea of a result, develops gradually into another field inwhich that result either appears as accomplished, or else is prevented by obstacles against which we still feel ourselvesto press. As I now write, I am in one of these activity situations. I 'strive' after words, which I only half prefigure, butwhich, when they shall have come, must satisfactorily complete the nascent sense I have of what they ought to be.The words are to run out of my pen, which I find that my hand actuates so obediently to desire that I am hardlyconscious either of resistance or of effort. Some of the words come wrong, and then I do feel a resistance, notmuscular but mental, which instigates a new instalment of my activity, accompanied by more or less feeling ofexertion. If the resistance were to my muscles, the exertion would contain an element of strain or squeeze which isless present where the resistance is only mental. If it proves considerable in either kind I may leave off trying toovercome it; or, on the other hand, I may sustain my effort till I have succeeded in my aim.It seems to me that in such a continuously developing experiential series our concrete perception of causality is foundin operation. If the word have any meaning at all it must mean what there we live through. What 'efficacy' and'activity' are known-as is what these appear.In it 'final' and 'efficient' causation coincideThe experiencer of such a situation feels the push, the obstacle, the will, the strain, the triumph, or the passive givingup, just as he feels the time, the space, the swiftness or intensity, the movement, the weight and color, the pain andpleasure, the complexity, or whatever remaining characters the situation may involve. He goes through all that canever be"},{"pageNumber":1152,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1091 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 04]Page 1091imagined where activity is supposed. The word 'activity' has no content save these experiences of process, obstruction,striving, strain, or release, ultimate qualia as they are of the life given us to be known. No matter what 'efficacies'there may really be in this extraordinary universe it is impossible to conceive of any one of them being either livedthrough or authentically known otherwise than in this dramatic shape of something sustaining a felt purpose againstfelt obstacles, and overcoming or being overcome. What 'sustaining' means here is clear to anyone who has livedthrough the experience, but to no one else; just as 'loud,' 'red,' 'sweet,' mean something only to beings with ears, eyes,and tongues. The percipi in these originals of experience is the esse; the curtain is the picture. If there is anythinghiding in the background, it ought not to be called causal agency, but should get itself another name.And novelties ariseThe way in which we feel that our successive fields continue each other in these cases is evidently what the orthodoxdoctrine means when it vaguely says that 'in some way' the cause 'contains' the effect. It contains it by proposing it asthe end pursued. Since the desire of that end is the efficient cause, we see that in the total fact of personal activityfinal and efficient causes coalesce. Yet the effect is oftenest contained aliquo modo only, and seldom explicitlyforeseen. The activity sets up more effects than it proposes literally. The end is defined beforehand in most cases onlyas a general direction, along which all sorts of novelties and surprises lie in wait. These words I write even nowsurprise me; yet I adopt them as effects of my scriptorial causality. Their being 'contained' means only their harmonyand continuity with my general aim. They 'fill the bill' and I accept them, but the exact shape of them seemsdetermined by something outside of my explicit will.If we look at the general mass of things in the midst of which the life of men is passed, and ask 'How came they here?' the only broad answer is that man's desires preceded and produced them. If not all-sufficient causes, desire and willwere at any rate what John Mill calls unconditional causes, indispensable causes namely, without which the effectscould not have come at all.

Since at each phase of this movement novelties turn up, we may fairly ask, withCarpenter, whether we are not here witnessing in our own personal experience what is really the essential process ofcreation. Is not the world really growing in these activities of ours? And where we predicate activities elsewhere, havewe a right to suppose aught different in kind from this?To some such vague vision are we brought by taking our perceptual experience of action at its face-value, andfollowing the analogies which it suggests.Perceptual causation sets a problemI say vague vision, for even if our desires be an unconditional causal factor in the only part of the universe where weare intimately acquainted with the way creative work is done, desire is anything but a close factor, even there. The partof the world to which our desires lie closest is, by the consent of physiologists, the cortex of the brain. If they actcausally, their first effect is there, and only through innumerable neural, muscular, and instrumental intermediaries isthat last effect which they consciously aimed at brought to birth. Our trust in the face-value of perception wasapparently misleading. There is no such continuity between cause-and-effect as in our activity-experiences was madeto appear. There is disruption rather; and what we naïvely assume to be continuous is separated by causal successionsof which perception is wholly unaware.The logical conclusion would seem to be that even if the kind of thing that causation is, were revealed to us in ourown activity, we should be mistaken on the very threshold if we supposed that the fact of it is there. In other words weseem in this line of experience to start with an illusion of place. It is as if a baby were born at a kinetoscope-show andhis first experiences were of the illusions of movement that reigned in the place. The nature of movement wouldindeed be revealed to him, but the real facts of movement he would have to seek1The Art of Creation, 1894, chap. i."},{"pageNumber":1154,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1093 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 05]Page 1093outside. Even so our will-acts may reveal the nature of causation, but just where the facts of causation are locatedmay be a further problem.1 With this further problem, philosophy leaves off comparing conceptual with perceptualexperience, and begins enquiring into physical and psychological facts.This is the problem of the relation of mind to brainPerception has given us a positive idea of causal agency but it remains to be ascertained whether what first appears assuch, is really such; whether aught else is really such; or finally, whether nothing really such exists. Since with this weare led immediately into the mind-brain relation, and since that is such a complicated topic, we had better interrupt ourstudy of causation provisionally at the present point, meaning to complete it when the problem of the mind's relationto the body comes up for review.ConclusionOur outcome so far seems therefore to be only this, that the attempt to treat 'cause,' for conceptual purposes, as aseparable link, has failed historically, and has led to the denial of efficient causation, and to the substitution for it ofthe bare descriptive notion of uniform sequence among events. Thus intellectualist philosophy once more has had tobutcher our perceptual life in order to make it 'comprehensible.' Meanwhile the concrete perceptual flux, taken just asit comes, offers in our own activity-situations perfectly comprehensible instances of causal agency. The transitivecausation in them does not, it is true, stick out as a separate piece of fact for conception to fix upon. Rather does awhole subsequent field grow continuously out of a whole antecedent field because it seems to yield new being of thenature called for, while the feeling of causality-at-work flavors the entire concrete sequence as salt flavors the waterin which it is dissolved.If we took these experience as the type of what actual causation is, we should have to ascribe to cases of causation1With this cause-and-effect are in what is called a transitive relation: as 'more than more is more than less,' so 'cause of cause is cause ofeffect.' In a chain of causes, intermediaries can drop out and (logically at least) the relation still hold between the extreme terms, thewider causal span enveloping, without altering the 'closer' one. This consideration may provisionally mitigate the impression offalsehood which psychophysical criticism finds in our consciousness of activity. The subject will come up later in more detail."},{"pageNumber":1155,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1094 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 06]Page 1094outside of our own life, to physical cases also, an inwardly experiential nature. In other words we should have toespouse a so-called 'pan-psychic' philosophy. This complication, and the fact that hidden brain-events appear to be'closer' effects than those which consciousness directly aims at, lead us to interrupt the subject here provisionally. Ourmain result, up to this point, has been the contrast between the perceptual and the intellectualist treatment of it.11Almost no philosopher has admitted that perception can give us relations immediately. Relations have invariably been called the workof 'thought,' so cause must be a 'category.' The result is well shown in such a treatment of the subject as Mr. Shadworth Hodgson's, in hiselaborate work the Metaphysic of Experience. 'What we call conscious activity is not a consciousness of activity in the sense of animmediate perception of it. Try to perceive activity or effort immediately, and you will fail; you will find nothing there to perceive' (i,180). As there is nothing there to conceive either, in the discrete manner which Mr. Hodgson desiderates, he has to conclude that'Causality per se (why need it be per se?) has no scientific or philosophic justification . All cases of common-sense causality resolvethemselves, on analysis, into cases of post hoc, cum illo, evenit istud. Hence we say that the search for causes is given up in science andphilosophy, and replaced by the search for real conditions (i. e., phenomenal antecedents merely) and the laws of real conditioning. Itmust also be recognized that realities answering to the terms cause and causality per se are impossible and non-existent' (ii, 374 378).The author whose discussion most resembles my own (apart from Bergson's, of which more later) is Prof. James Ward in his Naturalism andAgnosticism (see the words 'activity' and 'causality' in the index). Consult also the chapter on 'Mental Activity' in G. F. Stout's AnalyticPsychology, vol. i. W. James's Pluralistic Universe, Appendix B, may also be consulted. Some authors seem to think that we do have anideal conception of genuine activity which none of our experiences, least of all personal ones, match. Hence, and not because activity is aspurious idea altogether, are all the activities we imagine false. Mr. F. H. Bradley seems to occupy some such position, but I am not sure."},{"pageNumber":1156,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1095 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 06]Page 1095AppendixFaith and the Right to BelieveIntellectualism' is the belief that our mind comes upon a world complete in itself, and has the duty of ascertaining itscontents; but has no power of re-determining its character, for that is already given.Among intellectualists two parties may be distinguished. Rationalizing intellectualists lay stress on deductive and'dialectic' arguments, making large use of abstract concepts and pure logic (Hegel, Bradley, Taylor, Royce). Empiricistintellectualists are more 'scientific,' and think that the character of the world must be sought in our sensibleexperiences, and found in hypotheses based exclusively thereon (Clifford, Pearson).Both sides insist that in our conclusions personal preferences should play no part, and that no argument from whatought to be to what is, is valid. 'Faith,' being the greeting of our whole nature to a kind of world conceived as welladapted to that nature, is forbidden, until purely intellectual evidence that such is the actual world has come in. Even ifevidence should eventually prove a faith true, the truth, says Clifford, would have been 'stolen,' if assumed and actedon too soon.Refusal to believe anything concerning which 'evidence' has not yet come in, would thus be the rule of intellectualism.Obviously it postulates certain conditions, which for aught we can see need not necessarily apply to all the dealings ofour minds with the Universe to which they belong.1. It postulates that to escape error is our paramount duty. Faith may grasp truth; but also it may not. By resisting italways, we are sure of escaping error; and if by the same act we renounce our chance at truth, that loss is the lesserevil, and should be incurred.2. It postulates that in every respect the universe is finished in advance of our dealings with it;That the knowledge of what it thus is, is best gained by a"},{"pageNumber":1157,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1096 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 07]Page 1096passively receptive mind, with no native sense of probability, or good-will towards any special result;That 'evidence' not only needs no good-will for its reception; but is able, if patiently waited for, to neutralize ill-will;Finally, that our beliefs and our acts based thereupon, although they are parts of the world, and although the worldwithout them is unfinished, are yet such mere externalities as not to alter in any way the significance of the rest of theworld when they are added to it.In our dealings with many details of fact these postulates work well. Such details exist in advance of our opinion; truthconcerning them is often of no pressing importance; and by believing nothing, we escape error while we wait. Buteven here we often cannot wait but must act, somehow; so we act on most probable hypothesis, trusting that the eventmay prove us wise. Moreover, not to act on one belief, is often equivalent to acting as if the opposite belief were true,so inaction would not always be as 'passive' as the intellectualists assume. It is one attitude of will.Again, Philosophy and Religion have to interpret the total character of the world, and it is by no means clear that herethe intellectualist postulates obtain. It may be true all the while (even though the evidence be still imperfect) that, asPaulsen says, 'the natural order is at bottom a moral order.' It may be true that work is still doing in the world-process,and that in that work we are called to bear our share. The character of the world's results may in part depend upon ouracts. Our acts may depend on our religion,—on our not-resisting our faith-tendencies, or on our sustaining them inspite of 'evidence' being incomplete. These faith-tendencies in turn are but expressions of our good-will towardscertain forms of result.Such faith-tendencies are extremely active psychological forces, constantly outstripping evidence. The following stepsmay be called the 'faith-ladder':1. There is nothing absurd in a certain view of the world being true, nothing self-contradictory;2. It might have been true under certain conditions;3. It may be true, even now;"},{"pageNumber":1158,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1097 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 07]Page 10974. It is fit to be true;5. It ought to be true;6. It must be true;7. It shall be true, at any rate true for me.Obviously this is no intellectual chain of inferences, like the sorites of the logic-books. Yet it is a slope of good-willon which in the larger questions of life men habitually live.Intellectualism's proclamation that our good-will, our 'will to believe,' is a pure disturber of truth, is itself an act offaith of the most arbitrary kind. It implies the will to insist on a universe of intellectualist constitution, and thewillingness to stand in the way of a pluralistic universe's success, such success requiring the good-will and activefaith, theoretical as well as practical, of all concerned, to make it 'come true.'Intellectualism thus contradicts itself. It is a sufficient objection to it, that if a 'pluralistically' organized, or 'co-operative' universe or the 'melioristic' universe above, were really here, the veto of intellectualism on letting our good-will ever have any vote would debar us from ever admitting that universe to be true.Faith thus remains as one of the inalienable birthrights of our mind. Of course it must remain a practical, and not adogmatic attitude. It must go with toleration of other faiths, with the search for the most probable, and with the fullconsciousness of responsibilities and risks.It may be regarded as a formative factor in the universe, if we be integral parts thereof, and co-determinants, by ourbehavior, of what its total character may be.How we Act on ProbabilitiesIn most emergencies we have to act on probability, and incur the risk of error.'Probability' and 'possibility' are terms applied to things of the conditions of whose coming we are (to some degree atleast) ignorant.If we are entirely ignorant of the conditions that make a thing come, we call it a 'bare' possibility. If we know thatsome of the conditions already exist, it is for us in so far forth"},{"pageNumber":1159,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1098 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 08]Page 1098a 'grounded' possibility. It is in that case probable just in proportion as the said conditions are numerous, and fewhindering conditions are in sight.When the conditions are so numerous and confused that we can hardly follow them, we treat a thing as probable inproportion to the frequency with which things of that kind occur. Such frequency being a fraction, the probability isexpressed by a fraction. Thus, if one death in 10,000 is by suicide, the antecedent probability of my death being asuicide is I 10,000th. If one house in 5000 burns down annually, the probability that my house will burn is 1 5000th,etc.Statistics show that in most kinds of thing the frequency is pretty regular. Insurance companies bank on this regularity,undertaking to pay (say) 5000 dollars to each man whose house burns, provided he and the other house-owners eachpay enough to give the company that sum, plus something more for profits and expenses.The company, hedging on the large number of cases it deals with, and working by the long run, need run no risk ofloss by the single fires.The individual householder deals with his own single case exclusively. The probability of his house burning is only1 5000, but if that lot befall he will lose everything. He has no 'long run' to go by, if his house takes fire, and he can'thedge as the company does, by taxing his more fortunate neighbors. But in this particular kind of risk, the companyhelps him out. It translates his one chance in 5000 of a big loss, into a certain loss 5000 times smaller, and the bargainis a fair one on both sides. It is clearly better for the man to lose certainly, but fractionally, than to trust to his 4999chances of no loss, and then have the improbable chance befall.But for most of our emergencies there is no insurance company at hand, and fractional solutions are impossible.Seldom can we act fractionally. If the probability that a friend is waiting for you in Boston is 1 2, how should you acton that probability? By going as far as the bridge? Better stay at home! Or if the probability is 1 2 that your partner isa villain, how should you act on that probability? By treating him as a villain one day, and confiding your money andyour secrets to him the next? That would be the worst of all solutions. In all"},{"pageNumber":1160,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1099 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 09]Page 1099such cases we must act wholly for one or the other horn of the dilemma. We must go in for the more probablealternative as if the other one did not exist, and suffer the full penalty if the event belie our faith.Now the metaphysical and religious alternatives are largely of this kind. We have but this one life in which to take upour attitude towards them, no insurance company is there to cover us, and if we are wrong, our error, even though itbe not as great as the old hell-fire theology pretended, may yet be momentous. In such questions as that of thecharacter of the world, of life being moral in its essential meaning, of our playing a vital part therein, etc., it wouldseem as if a certain wholeness in our faith were necessary. To calculate the probabilities and act fractionally, and treatlife one day as a farce, and another day as a very serious business, would be to make the worst possible mess of it.Inaction also often counts as action. In many issues the inertia of one member will impede the success of the whole asmuch as his opposition will. To refuse, e.g., to testify against villainy, is practically to help it to prevail.1The Pluralistic or Melioristic UniverseFinally, if the 'melioristic' universe were really here, it would require the active good-will of all of us, in the way ofbelief as well as of our other activities, to bring it to a prosperous issue.The melioristic universe is conceived after a social analogy, as a pluralism of independent powers. It will succeed justin proportion as more of these work for its success. If none work, it will fail. If each does his best, it will not fail. Itsdestiny thus hangs on an if, or on a lot of ifs—which amounts to saying (in the technical language of logic) that, theworld being as yet unfinished, its total character can be expressed only by hypothetical and not by categoricalpropositions.(Empiricism, believing in possibilities, is willing to formulate its universe in hypothetical propositions. Rationalism,believing only in impossibilities and necessities, insists on the contrary on their being categorical.)1Cf. Wm. James: The Will to Believe, etc., pp. 1 31, and 90 110."},{"pageNumber":1161,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1100 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 09]Page 1100As individual members of a pluralistic universe, we must recognize that, even though we do our best, the other factorsalso will have a voice in the result. If they refuse to conspire, our good-will and labor may be thrown away. Noinsurance company can here cover us or save us from the risks we run in being part of such a world.We must take one of four attitudes in regard to the other powers: either1. Following intellectualist advice: wait for evidence; and while waiting, do nothing; or2. Mistrust the other powers and, sure that the universe will fail, let it fail; or3. Trust them; and at any rate do our best, in spite of the if; or, finally,4. Flounder, spending one day in one attitude, another day in another.This 4th way is no systematic solution. The 2d way spells faith in failure. The 1st way may in practice beindistinguishable from the 2d way. The 3d way seems the only wise way.'If we do our best, and the other powers do their best, the world will be perfected'—this proposition expresses noactual fact, but only the complexion of a fact thought of as eventually possible. As it stands, no conclusion can bepositively deduced from it. A conclusion would require another premise of fact, which only we can supply. Theoriginal proposition per se has no pragmatic value whatsover, apart from its power to challenge our will to producethe premise of fact required. Then indeed the perfected world emerges as a logical conclusion.We can create the conclusion, then. We can and we may, as it were, jump with both feet off the ground into ortowards a world of which we trust the other parts to meet our jump—and only so can the making of a perfected worldof the pluralistic pattern ever take place. Only through our precursive trust in it can it come into being.There is no inconsistency anywhere in this, and no 'vicious circle' unless a circle of poles holding themselves uprightby leaning on one another, or a circle of dancers revolving by holding each other's hands, be 'vicious.'The faith circle is so congruous with human nature that the only explanation of the veto that intellectualists pass uponit"},{"pageNumber":1162,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1101 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 10]Page 1101must be sought in the offensive character to them of the faiths of certain concrete persons.Such possibilities of offense have, however, to be put up with on empiricist principles. The long run of experiencemay weed out the more foolish faiths. Those who held them will then have failed: but without the wiser faiths of theothers the world could never be perfected.(Compare G.

The man in question had been satisfied to work at Philosophy for her own sweet (or bitter) sake, and haddisdained to consider that an academic bauble should be his reward.His appointment had thus been made under a misunderstanding. He was not the proper man; and there was nothing todo but to inform him of the fact. It was notified to him by his new President that his appointment must be revoked orthat a Harvard doctor's degree must forthwith be procured.Although it was already the Spring of the year, our Subject, being a man of spirit, took up the challenge, turned hisback upon literature (which in view of his approaching duties might have seemed his more urgent concern) and spentthe weeks that were left him, in writing a metaphysical thesis and grinding his psychology, logic and history ofphilosophy up again, so as to pass our formidable ordeals.When the thesis came to be read by our committee, we could not pass it. Brilliancy and originality by themselveswon't save a thesis for the doctorate; it must also exhibit a heavy technical apparatus of learning; and this ourcandidate had neglected to bring to bear. So, telling him that he was temporarily rejected, we advised him to pad outthe thesis properly, and return with it next year, at the same time informing his new President that this signifiednothing as to his merits, that he was of ultra Ph.D. quality, and one of the strongest men with whom we had ever hadto deal.To our surprise we were given to understand in reply that the quality per se of the man signified nothing in thisconnection, and that three magical letters were the thing seriously required. The College had always gloried in a list offaculty"},{"pageNumber":1181,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1112 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 18]Page 1112members who bore the doctor's title, and to make a gap in the galaxy, and admit a common fox without a tail, wouldbe a degradation impossible to be thought of. We wrote again, pointing out that a Ph.D. in philosophy would provelittle anyhow as to one's ability to teach literature; we sent separate letters in which we outdid each other in eulogy ofour candidate's powers, for indeed they were great; and at last, mirabile dictu, our eloquence prevailed. He wasallowed to retain his appointment provisionally, on condition that one year later at the farthest his miserably nakedname should be prolonged by the sacred appendage the lack of which had given so much trouble to all concerned.Accordingly he came up here the following spring with an adequate thesis (known since in print as a most brilliantcontribution to metaphysics), passed a first-rate examination, wiped out the stain, and brought his college into properrelations with the world again. Whether his teaching, during that first year, of English Literature was made any thebetter by the impending examination in a different subject, is a question which I will not try to solve.I have related this incident at such length because it is so characteristic of American academic conditions at thepresent day. Graduate schools still are something of a novelty, and higher diplomas something of a rarity. The latter,therefore, carry a vague sense of preciousness and honor, and have a particularly \"up-to-date\" appearance, and it is nowonder if smaller institutions, unable to attract professors already eminent, and forced usually to recruit their facultiesfrom the relatively young, should hope to compensate for the obscurity of the names of their officers of instruction bythe abundance of decorative titles by which those names are followed on the pages of the catalogues where theyappear. The dazzled reader of the list, the parent or student, says to himself, \"this must be a terribly distinguishedcrowd—their titles shine like the stars in the firmament, Ph.D's, S.D.'s, and Litt.D.'s, bespangle the page as if theywere sprinkled over it from a pepper caster.\"Human nature is once for all so childish that every reality becomes a sham somewhere, and in the minds of Presidentsand Trustees the Ph.D. degree, is in point of fact already"},{"pageNumber":1182,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1113 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 18]Page 1113looked upon as a mere advertising resource, a manner of throwing dust in the Public's eyes. \"No instructor who is nota Doctor\" has become maxim in the smaller institutions which represent demand; and in each of the larger ones whichrepresent supply, the same belief in decorated scholarship expresses itself in two antagonistic passions, one formultiplying as much as possible the annual output of doctors, the other for raising the standard of difficulty in passing,so that the Ph.D. of the special institution shall early a higher blaze of distinction than it does elsewhere. Thus we atHarvard are proud of the number of candidates whom we reject, and of the inability of men who are not distingués inintellect to pass our tests.America is thus as a nation rapidly drifting towards a state of things in which no man of science or letters will beaccounted respectable unless some kind of badge or diploma is stamped upon him, and in which bare personality willbe a mark of outcast estate. It seems to me high time to rouse ourselves to consciousness, and to cast a critical eyeupon this decidedly grotesque tendency. Other nations suffer terribly from the Mandarin disease. Are we doomed tosuffer like the rest?Our higher degrees were instituted for the laudable purpose of stimulating scholarship, especially in the form of\"original research.\" Experience has proved that great as the love of truth may be among men, it can be made stillgreater by adventitious rewards. The winning of a diploma certifying mastery and marking a barrier successfullypassed, acts as a challenge to the ambitious; and if the diploma will help to gain bread-winning positions also, itspower as a stimulus to work is tremendously increased. So far, we are on innocent ground; it is well for a country tohave research in abundance, and our graduate schools do but apply a normal psychological spur. But theinstitutionizing on a large scale of any natural combination of need and motive always tends to run into technicallyand to develop a tyrannical Machine with unforeseen powers of exclusion and corruption. Observation of theworkings of our Harvard system for 20 years past has brought some of these drawbacks home to my consciousness,and I should like to call the attention of the readers of the"},{"pageNumber":1183,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1114 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 19]Page 1114MONTHLY to this disadvantageous aspect of the picture, and to make a couple of remedial suggestions, if I may.In the first place, it would seem that to stimulate study, and to increase the gelehrtes Publikum, the class of highlyeducated men in our country, is the only positive good, and consequently the sole direct end at which our graduateschools, with their diploma-giving powers, should aim. If other results have developed they should be deemedsecondary incidents, and if not desirable in themselves, they should be carefully guarded against.To interfere with the free development of talent, to obstruct the natural play of supply and demand in the teachingprofession, to foster academic snobbery by the prestige of certain privileged institutions, to transfer accredited valuefrom essential manhood to an outward badge, to blight hopes and promote invidious sentiments, to divert the attentionof aspiring youth from direct dealings with truth to the passing of examinations,—such consequences, if they exist,ought surely to be regarded as drawbacks to the system, and an enlightened public consciousness ought to be keenlyalive to the importance of reducing their amount. Candidates themselves do seem to be keenly conscious of some ofthese evils, but outside of their ranks or in the general public no such consciousness, so far as I can see, exists; or if itdoes exist, it fails to express itself aloud. Schools, Colleges, and Universities, appear enthusiastic over the entiresystem, just as it stands, and unanimously applaud all its developments.I beg the reader to consider some of the secondary evils which I have enumerated. First of all, is not our growingtendency to appoint no instructors who are not also doctors an instance of pure sham? Will any one pretend for amoment that the doctor's degree is a guarantee that its possessor will be successful as a teacher? Notoriously hismoral, social and personal characteristics may utterly disqualify him for success in the class-room; and of thesecharacteristics his doctor's examination is unable to take any account whatever. Certain bare human beings will alwaysbe better candidates for a given place than all the doctor-applicants on hand; and to exclude the former by a rigid rule,and in the end to have to sift the latter by private inquiry into their personal peculiari-"},{"pageNumber":1184,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1115 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 20]Page 1115ties among those who know them, just as if they were not doctors at all, is to stultify one's own procedure. You maysay that at least you guard against ignorance of the subject by considering only the candidates who are doctors; buthow then about making doctors in one subject teach a different subject? This happened in the instance by which Iintroduced this article, and it happens daily and hourly in all our colleges. The truth is that the Doctor-Monopoly inteaching, which is becoming so rooted an American custom, can show no serious grounds whatsoever for itself inreason. As it actually prevails and grows in vogue among us, it is due to childish motives exclusively. In reality it isbut a sham, a bauble, a dodge whereby to decorate the catalogues of schools and colleges.Next, let us turn from the general promotion of a spirit of academic snobbery to the particular damage done toindividuals by the system.There are plenty of individuals so well endowed by nature that they pass with ease all the ordeals with which lifeconfronts them. Such persons are born for professional success. Examinations have no terrors for the, and interfere inno way with their spiritual or worldly interests. There are others, no so gifted, who nevertheless rise to the challenge,get a stimulus from the difficulty, and become doctors, not without some baleful nervous wear and tear andretardation of their purely inner life, but on the whole successfully, and with advantage. These two classes from thenatural Ph.D.'s, for whom the degree is legitimately instituted. To be sure, the degree is of no consequence one way orthe other for the first sort of man, for in him the personal worth obviously outshines the title. To the second set ofpersons, however, the doctor-ordeal may contribute a touch of energy and solidity of scholarship which otherwisethey might have lacked, and were our candidates all drawn from these classes, no oppression would result from theinstitution.But there is a third class of persons who are genuinely, and in the most pathetic sense, the institution's victims. Forthis type of character the academic life may become, after a certain point, a virulent poison. Men without markedoriginality or native force, but fond of truth and especially of books and study, ambitious of reward and recognition,poor often, and"},{"pageNumber":1185,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1116 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 20]Page 1116needing a degree to get a teaching position, weak in the eyes of their examiners,—among these we find the veritablechair á canon of the wars of learning, the unfit in the academic struggle for existence. There are individuals of thissort for whom to pass one degree after another seems the limit of earthly aspiration. Your private advice does notdiscourage them. They will fail, and go away to recuperate, and then present themselves for another ordeal, andsometimes prolong the process into middle life. Or else, if they are less heroic morally they will accept the failure as asentence of doom that they are not fit, and are broken-spirited me thereafter.We of the University faculties are responsible for deliberately creating this new class of American social failures, andheavy is the responsibility. We advertise our ''schools\" and send out our degree-requirements, knowing well thataspirants of all sorts will be attracted, and at the same time we set a standard which intends to pass no man who hasnot native intellectual distinction. We know that there is no test, however absurd, by which, if a title or decoration, apublic badge or mark, were to be won by it, some weakly suggestible or hauntable persons would not feel challenged,and remain unhappy if they went without it. We dangle our three magic letters before the eyes of these predestinedvictims, and they swarm to us like moths to an electric light. They come at a time of life when failure can no longerbe repaired easily and when the wounds it leaves are permanent; and we say deliberately that mere work faithfullyperformed, as they perform it, will not by itself save them, they must in addition put in evidence the one thing theyhave not got, namely this quality of intellectual distinction. Occasionally, out of sheer human pity, we ignore our highand mighty standard and pass them. Usually, however, the standard, and not the candidate, commands our fidelity.The result is caprice, majorities of one on the jury, and on the whole a confession that our pretensions about thedegree cannot be lived up to consistently. Thus, partiality in the favored cases; in the unfavored, blood on our hands;and in both a bad conscience,—are the results of our administration.The more widespread becomes the popular belief that our diplomas are indispensable hall-marks to show the sterling"},{"pageNumber":1186,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1117 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 21]Page 1117metal of their holders, the more widespread these corruptions will become. We ought to look to the future carefully,for it takes generations for a national custom, once rooted, to be grown away from. All the European countries areseeking to diminish the check upon individual spontaneity which state examinations with their tyrannous growth havebrought in their train. We have had to institute state examinations too; and it will perhaps be fortunate if some dayhereafter our descendants, comparing machine with machine, do no sigh with regret for old times and Americanfreedom, and wish that the régime of the dear old bosses might be reinstalled, with plain human nature, the glad handand the marble heart, liking and disliking, and man-to-man relations grown possible again. Meanwhile, whateverevolution our state-examinations are destined to undergo, our universities at least should never cease to regardthemselves as the jealous custodians of personal and spiritual spontaneity. They are indeed its only organized andrecognized custodians in America today. They ought to guard against contributing to the increase of officialism andsnobbery and insincerity as against a pestilence; they ought to keep truth and disinterested labor always in theforeground, treat degrees as secondary incidents, and in season and out of season make it plain that what they live foris to help men's souls, and not to decorate their persons with diplomas.There seem to be three obvious ways in which the increasing hold of the Ph.D. Octopus upon American life can bekept in check.The first way lies with the Universities. They can lower their fantastic standards (which here at Harvard we are soproud of) and give the doctorate as a matter of course, just as they give the bachelor's degree, for a due amount oftime spent in patient labor in a special department of learning. whether the man be a brilliantly gifted individual ornot. Surely native distinction needs no official stamp, and should disdain to ask for one. On the other hand, faithfullabor, however commonplace, and years devoted to a subject, always deserve to be acknowledged and requited.The second way lies with both the Universities and Colleges. Let them give up their unspeakably silly ambition to"},{"pageNumber":1187,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1118 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 21]Page 1118bespangle their lists of officers with these doctorial titles. Let them look more to substance and less to vanity andsham.The third way lies with the individual student, and with his personal advisers in the Faculties. Every man of nativepower, who might take a higher degree, and refuses to do so, because examinations interfere with the free followingout of his more immediate intellectual aims, deserves well of his country, and in a rightly organized community,would not be made to suffer for his independence. With many men the passing of these extraneous tests is a verygrievous interference indeed. Private letters of recommendation from their instructors, which in any event areultimately needful, ought, in these cases, completely to offset the lack of the bread-winning degree; and instructorsought to be ready to advise students against it upon occasion, and to pledge themselves to back them later personally,in the market-struggle which they have to face.It is indeed odd to see this love of titles—and such titles—growing up in a country of which the recognition ofindividuality and bare manhood have so long have been supposed to be the very soul. The independence of the State,in which most of our colleges stand, relieves us of those more odious forms of academic politics which continentalEuropean countries present. Anything like the elaborate University machine of France, with its throttling influencesupon individuals is unknown here. The spectacle of the \"Rath\" distinction in its innumerable spheres and grades, withwhich all Germany is crawling today, is displeasing to American eyes; and displeasing also in some respects is theinstitution of knighthood in England, which, aping as it does an aristocratic title, enables one's wife as well as one'sself so easily to dazzle the servants at the house of one's friends. But we Americans ourselves destined after all tohunger after similar vanities on an infinitely more contemptible scale? And is individuality with us also going to countfor nothing unless stamped and licensed and authenticated by some title-giving machine? Let us pray that our ancientnational genius may long preserve vitality enough to guard us from a future so unmanly and so unbeautiful!The Harvard Monthly, March 1903"},{"pageNumber":1188,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1119 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 22]Page 1119Address at the Centenary of Ralph Waldo Emerson, May 25, 1903The pathos of death is this, when the days of one's life are ended, those days that were so crowded with business andfelt so heavy in their passing, what remains of one in memory should usually be so slight a thing. The phantom of anattitude, the echo of a certain mode of thought, a few pages of print, some invention, or some victory we gained in abrief critical hour, are all that can survive the best of us. It is as if the whole of a man's significance had now shrunkinto the phantom of an attitude, into a mere musical note or phrase, suggestive of his singularity—happy are thosewhose singularity gives a note so clear as to be victorious over the inevitable pity of such a diminution andabridgment.An ideal wraith like this, of Emerson's singularity, hovers over all Concord to-day, taking in the minds of those of youwho were his neighbors and intimates a somewhat fuller shape, remaining more abstract in the younger generation,but bringing home to all of us the notion of a spirit indescribably precious. The form that so lately moved upon thesestreets and country roads, or awaited in these fields and woods and beloved Muse's visits, is now dust; but the soul'snote, the spiritual voice, rises strong and clear above the uproar of the times, and seems securely destined to exert anennobling influence over future generations.What gave a flavor so matchless to Emerson's individuality was, even more than his rich mental gifts, theircombination. Rarely has a man so known the limits of his genius or so unfailingly kept within them. \"Stand by yourorder,\" he used to say to youthful students; and perhaps the paramount impression one gets of his life is of his loyaltyto his own type and mission. The type was that of what he liked to call the scholar, the perceiver of pure truth, and themission was that of the reporter in worthy form of each perception. The day is good, he said, in which we have themost perceptions. There are times when the cawing of a crow, a weed, a snowflake, or a farmer planting in his field,become symbols to the intellect"},{"pageNumber":1189,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1120 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 22]Page 1120of truths equal to those which the most majestic phenomena can open. Let me mind my own charge, then, walk alone,consult the sky, the field and forest, sedulously waiting every morning for the news concerning the structure of theuniverse which the good Spirit will give me.This was the first half of Emerson, but only half, for his genius was insatiate for expression, and his truth had to beclad in the right verbal garment. The form of the garment was so vital with Emerson that it is impossible to separate itfrom the matter. They form a chemical combination,—thoughts which would be trivial expressed otherwise areimportant through the nouns and verbs to which he married them. The style is the man, it has been said: the manEmerson's mission culminated in his style, and if we must define him in one word, we have to call him Artist. He wasan artist whose medium was verbal and who wrought in spiritual material.This duty of spiritual seeing and reporting determined the whole tenor of his life. It was to shield it from invasion anddistraction that he dwelt in the country, and that he consistently declined to entangle himself with associations or toencumber himself with functions which, however he might believe in them, he felt were duties for other men and notfor him. Even the care of his garden, \"with its stoopings and fingerings in a few yards of space,\" he found \"narrowingand poisoning,\" and took to long free walks and saunterings instead, without apology. \"Causes\" innumerable sought toenlist him as their ''worker\"—all got his smile and word of sympathy, but none entrapped him into service. Thestruggle against slavery itself, deeply as it appealed to him, found him firm: \"God must govern his own world, andknows his way out of this pit without my desertion of my post, which has none to guard it but me. I have quite otherslaves to face than those Negroes, to wit, imprisoned thoughts far back in the brain of man, and which have nowatchman or lover or defender but me.\" This in reply to the possible questions of his conscience. To hot-bloodedmoralists with more objective ideas of duty, such a fidelity to the limits of his genius must often have made him seemprovokingly remote and unavailable; but we who can see things in more liberal perspective"},{"pageNumber":1190,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1121 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 23]Page 1121must unqualifiedly approve the results. The faultless tact with which he kept his safe limits while he so dauntlesslyasserted himself within them is an example fitted to give heart to other theorists and artists the world over.The insight and creed from which Emerson's life followed can be best summed up in his own verse:—\"So nigh is grandeur to our dust,So near is God to man!\"Through the individual fact there ever shone for him the effulgence of the Universal Reason. The great CosmicIntellect terminates and houses itself in mortal men and passing hours. Each of us is an angle of its eternal vision, andthe only way to be true to our Maker is to be loyal to ourselves. \"O rich and various Man!\" he cries, \"thou palace ofsight and sound, carrying in thy senses the morning and the night and the unfathomable galaxy; in thy brain thegeometry of the city of God; in thy heart the bower of love and the realms of right and wrong.\"If the individual open thus directly into the Absolute, it follows that there is something in each and all of us, even thelowliest, that ought not to consent to borrowing traditions and living at second hand. \"If John was perfect, why areyou and I alive?\" writes Emerson. \"As long as any man exists there is some need of him; let him fight for his own.\"This faith that in a life at first hand there is something scared is perhaps the most characteristic note in Emerson'swritings. The hottest side of him is this non-conformist persuasion, and if his temper could ever verge on commonirascibility, it would be by reason of the passionate character of his feelings on this point. The world is still new anduntried. In seeing freshly, and not in hearing of what others saw, shall a man find what truth is. \"Each one of us canbask in the great morning which rises out of the Eastern Sea, and be himself one of the children of the light.\" Trustthyself, every heart vibrates to that iron string. There is a time in each man's education when he must arrive at theconviction that imitation is suicide; when he must take himself for better or worse as his portion; and know thatthough the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil"},{"pageNumber":1191,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1122 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 24]Page 1122bestowed on that plot of ground which it was given him to till.\"The matchless eloquence with which Emerson proclaimed the sovereignty of the living individual electrified andemancipated his generation, and this bugle-blast will doubtless be regarded by future critics as the soul of hismessage. The present man is the aboriginal reality, the Institution is derivative, and the past man is irrelevant andobliterate for present issues. \"If any one would lay an exe to your tree with a text from I John, v. 7, or a sentencefrom Saint Paul, say to him,\" Emerson wrote, \"'My tree is Ygdrasil, the tree of life.' Let him know by your securitythat your conviction is clear and sufficient, and, if he were Paul himself, that you also are here and with your Creator.\"\"Cleave ever to God,\" he insisted, \"against the name of God;\"—and so, in spite of the intensely religious character ofhis total thought, when he began his career it seemed to many of his brethren in the clerical profession that he waslittle more than an iconoclast and desecrator.Emerson's belief that the individual must in reason be adequate to the vocation for which the Spirit of the world hascalled him into being is the source of those sublime pages, hearteners and sustainers of our youth, in which he urgeshis hearers to be incorruptibly true to their own private conscience. Nothing can harm the man who rests in hisappointed place and character. Such a man is invulnerable; he balances the universe, balance it as much by keepingsmall when he is small as by being great and spreading when he is great. \"I love and honor Epaminondas,\" saidEmerson, \"but I do not wish to be Epaminondas. I hold it more just to love the world of this hour than the world ofhis hour. Nor can you, if I am true, excite me to the least uneasiness by saying, 'He acted and thou sittest still.' I seeaction to be good when the need is, and sitting still to be also good. Epaminondas, if he was the man I take him for,would have sat still with joy and peace, if his lot had been mine. Heaven is large, and affords space for all modes oflove and fortitude.\" \"The fact that I am here certainly shows me that the Soul has need of an organ here, and shall Inot assume the post?\"The vanity of all super-serviceableness and pretense was never more happily set forth than by Emerson in the many"},{"pageNumber":1192,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1123 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 24]Page 1123passages in which he develops this aspect of his philosophy. Character infallibly proclaims itself. \"Hide you thoughts!—hide the sun and moon. They publish themselves to the universe. They will speak through you though you weredumb. They will flow out of your actions, your manners and your face . Don't say things: What you are stands overyou the while and thunders so that I cannot say what you say to the contrary . What a man is engraves itself upon himin letters of light. Concealment avails him nothing, boasting nothing, There is confession in the glances of our eyes; inour smiles; in salutations; and the grasp of hands. His sin bedaubs him, mars all his good impression. Men know notwhy they do not trust him, but they do not trust him. His vice glasses the eye, casts lines of mean expression in thecheek, pinches the nose, sets the mark of the beast upon the back of the head, and writes, O fool! fool! on the foreheadof a king. If you would not be known to do a thing, never do it; a man may play the fool in the drifts of a desert, butevery grain of sand shall seem to see.—How can a man be concealed? How can he be concealed?\"On the other hand, never was a sincere word or a sincere thought utterly lost. \"Never a magnanimity fell to the groundbut there is some heart to greet and accept it unexpectedly . The hero fears not that if he withstood the avowal of a justand brave act, it will go unwitnessed and unloved. One knows it,—himself,—and is pledged by it to sweetness ofpeace and to nobleness of aim, which will prove in the end a better proclamation than the relating of the incident.\"The same indefeasible right to be exactly what one is, provided one only be authentic, spreads itself, in Emerson's wayof thinking, from persons to things and to times and places. No date, no position is insignificant, if the life that fills itout be only genuine:—\"In solitude, in a remote village, the ardent your loiters and mourns. With inflamed eye, in this sleeping wilderness, hehas read the story of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, until his fancy has brought home to the surrounding woods thefaint roar of cannonades in the Milanese, and marches in Germany.

The soul answers—Behold his day here! In the sighing of these woods, in thequiet of these gray fields, in the cool breeze that sings out of these northern mountains; in the workmen, the boys, themaidens you meet,—in the hopes of the morning, the ennui of noon, and sauntering of the afternoon; in thedisquieting comparisons; in the regrets at want of vigor; in the great idea and the puny execution:—behold Charles theFifth's day; another, yet the same; behold Chatham's, Hampden's, Bayard's, Alfred's, Scipio's, Pericles's day,—day ofall that are born of women. The difference of circumstance is merely costume. I am tasting the self-same life,—itssweetness, its greatness, its pain,—which I so admire in other men. Do not foolishly ask the inscrutable, obliteratedpast what it cannot tell,—the details of that nature, of that day, called Byron or Burke;—but ask it of the envelopingNow . Be lord of a day and you can put up your history books.\"Thus does \"the deep to-day which all men scorn\" receive from Emerson superb revindication. \"Other world! there isno other world.\" All God's life opens into the individual particular, and here and now, or nowhere, is reality. \"Thepresent hour is the decisive hour, and every day is doomsday.\"Such a conviction that Divinity is everywhere may easily make of one an optimist of the sentimental type that refusesto speak ill of anything. Emerson's drastic perception of differences kept him at the opposite pole from this weakness.After you have seen men a few times, he could say, you find most of them as alike as their barns and pantries, andsoon as musty and as dreary. Never was such a fastidious lover of significance and distinction, and never an eye sokeen for their discovery. His optimism had nothing in common with that indiscriminate hurrahing for the Universewith which Walt Whitman has made us familiar. Far Emerson, the individual fact and moment were indeed suffusedwith absolute radiance, but it was upon a condition that saved the situation—they must be worthy specimens,—sincere, authentic, archetypal; they must have made connection with what he calls the Moral Sentiment, they must insome way act as symbolic mouthpieces of the Universe's meaning.

Emerson himself was a real seer. He could perceive the full squalorof the individual fact, but he could also see the transfiguration. He might easily have found himself saying of somepresent-day agitator against our Philippine conquest what he said of this or that reformer of his own time. He mighthave called him, as a private person, a tedious bore and canter. But he would infallibly have added what he thenadded: \"It is strange and horrible to say this, for I feel that under him and his partiality and exclusiveness is the earthand the sea, and all that in them is, and the axis round which the Universe revolves passes through his body where hestands.\"Be it how it may, then, this is Emerson's revelation:—The point of any pen can be an epitome of reality; thecommonest person's act, if genuinely actuated, can lay hold on eternity. This vision is the head-spring of all hisoutpourings; and it is for this truth, given to no previous literary artist to express in such penetratingly persuasivetones, that posterity will reckon him a prophet, and, perhaps neglecting other pages, piously turn to those that conveythis message. His life was one long conversation with the invisible divine, expressing itself through individuals andparticulars:—\"So nigh is grandeur to our dust, so near is God to man!\"I spoke of how shrunken the wraith, how thin the echo, of men is after they are departed. Emerson's wraith comes tome now as if it were but the very voice of this victorious argument. His words to this effect are certain to be quotedand extracted more and more as time goes on, and to take their place among the Scriptures of humanity. \"'Gainst deathand all oblivious enmity shall you pace forth,\" beloved Master.

Coming as mine has come to-day, I prefer to take it for that far more valuable thing, a token of personal good will from friends. Recognizing thegood will and the friendliness, I am going to respond to the chairman's call by speaking exactly as I feel.I am not an alumnus of the College. I have not even a degree from the Scientific School, in which I did some studyforty years ago. I have no right to vote for Overseers, and I have never felt until to-day as if I were a child of thehouse of Harvard in the fullest sense. Harvard is many things in one—a school, a forcing house for thought, and alsoa social club; and the club aspect is so strong, the family tie so close and subtle among our Bachelors of Arts that allof us here who are in my plight, no matter how long we may have lived here, always feel a little like outsiders onCommencement day. We have no class to walk with, and we often stay away from the procession. It may be foolish,but it is a fact. I don't believe that my dear friends Shaler, Hollis, Lanman, or Royce ever have felt quite as happy oras much at home as my friend Barrett Wendell feels upon a day like this.I wish to use my present privilege to say a word for these outsiders with whom I belong. Many years ago there wasone of them from Canada here—a man with a high-pitched voice, who could n't fully agree with all the points of myphilosophy. At a lecture one day, when I was in the full flood of my eloquence, his voice rose above mine,exclaiming: \"But, doctor, doctor! to be serious for a moment \", in so sincere a tone that the whole room burst outlaughing. I want you now to be serious for a moment while I say my little say. We are glorifying ourselves to-day,and whenever the name of Harvard is emphatically uttered on such days, frantic cheers go up. There are days foraffection, when pure sentiment and loyalty come rightly to the fore. But behind our mere animal feeling for oldschoolmates and the Yard and the bell, and Memorial and the clubs and the river and the Soldier's Field,1Speech at the Harvard Commencement Dinner, June 24, 1903."},{"pageNumber":1196,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1127 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 26]Page 1127there must be something deeper and more rational. There ought at any rate to be some possible ground in reason forone's boiling over with joy that one is a son of Harvard, and was not, by some unspeakably horrible accident of birth,predestined to graduate at Yale or at Cornell.Any college can foster club loyalty of that sort. The only rational ground for preëminent admiration of any singlecollege would be its preëminent spiritual tone. But to be a college man in the mere clubhouse sense—I care not ofwhat college—affords no guarantee of real superiority in spiritual tone.The old notion that book learning can be a panacea for the vices of society lies pretty well shattered to-day. I say thisin spite of certain utterances of the President of this University to the teachers last year. That sanguine-hearted manseemed then to think that if the schools would only do their duty better, social vice might cease. But vice will nevercease. Every level of culture breeds its own peculiar brand of it as surely as one soil breeds sugar-cane, and anothersoil breeds cranberries. If we were asked that disagreeable question, \"What are the bosom-vices of the level of culturewhich our land and day have reached?\" we should be forced, I think, to give the still more disagreeable answer thatthey are swindling and adroitness, and the indulgence of swindling and adroitness, and cant, and sympathy with cant—natural fruits of that extraordinary idealization of \"success\" in the mere outward sense of \"getting there,\" and gettingthere on as big a scale as we can, which characterizes our present generation. What was Reason given to man for,some satirist has said, except to enable him to invent reasons for what he wants to do. We might say the same ofeducation. We see college graduates on every side of every public question. Some of Tammany's stanchest supportersare Harvard men. Harvard men defend our treatment of our Filipino allies as a masterpiece of policy and morals.Harvard men, as journalists, pride themselves on producing copy for any side that may enlist them. There is not apublic abuse for which some Harvard advocate may not be found.In the successful sense, then, in the worldly sense, in the club sense, to be a college man, even a Harvard man, affords"},{"pageNumber":1197,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1128 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 26]Page 1128no sure guarantee for anything but a more educated cleverness in the service of popular idols and vulgar ends. Is thereno inner Harvard within the outer Harvard which means definitely more than this—for which the outside men whocome here in such numbers, come? They come from the remotest outskirts of our country, without introductions,without school affiliations; special students, scientific students, graduate students, poor students of the College, whomake their living as they go. They seldom or never darken the doors of the Pudding or the Porcellian; they hover inthe background on days when the crimson color is most in evidence, but they nevertheless are intoxicated and exultantwith the nourishment they find here; and their loyalty is deeper and subtler and more a matter of the inmost soul thanthe gregarious loyalty of the clubhouse pattern often is.Indeed, there is such an inner spiritual Harvard; and the men I speak of, and for whom I speak to-day, are its truemissionaries and carry its gospel into infidel parts. When they come to Harvard, it is not primarily because she is aclub. It is because they have heard of her persistently atomistic constitution, of her tolerance of exceptionality andeccentricity, of her devotion to the principles of individual vocation and choice. It is because you cannot make singleone-ideaed regiments of her classes. It is because she cherishes so many vital ideals, yet makes a scale of valueamong them; so that even her apparently incurable second-rateness (or only occasional first-rateness) in intercollegiateathletics comes from her seeing so well that sport is but sport, that victory over Yale is not the whole of the law andthe prophets, and that a popgun is not the crack of doom.The true Church was always the invisible Church. The true Harvard is the invisible Harvard in the souls of her moretruth-seeking and independent and often very solitary sons. Thoughts are the precious seeds of which our universitiesshould be the botanical gardens.

But as a nursery forindependent and lonely thinkers I do believe that Harvard still is in the van. Here they find the climate so propitiousthat they can be happy in their very solitude.

'Duty and Destiny' have rolled over us like a Juggernaut carwhose unwieldy bulk the majority of our countrymen were pushing and pulling forward, and our outcries andattempts to scotch the wheels with our persons haven't acted in the least degree as a brake. Nevertheless, if we lookround us today we see a great change from the conditions that prevailed when the outbreak of hostilities first called usinto being. Religious emotion and martial hysterics are both over with the public, and the sober fit is on.In the physiologies which I studied when I was young, the function of incorporating foreign bodies into one'sorganism was divided into four stages—prehension, deglutition, digestion and assimilation. We prehended our prey,or took it into our mouth, when President McKinley posted his annexation edict, and insalivated with pious phrasesthe alternative he offered to our late allies of instant obedience or death. The morsel thus lubricated, deglutition wenton slowly during those three years and more when our army was slaughtering and burning, and famine, fire, diseaseand depopulation were the new allies we invoked. But if the swallowing took three years, how long ought the processof digestion, that teaching of the Filipinos to be 'fit' for rule, that solution of recalcitrant lumps into a smooth 'chyle,'with which our civil commission is charged—how long ought that to take? It will take a decade, at least. As forassimilation, that is altogether an affair of the day after tomorrow. The most sanguine expect no real assimilation ofour prey to us or of us to our prey for fifty years to come, and no one who knows history expects that it can genuinelycome at all.Meanwhile, in spite of the indifference of the newspapers and in spite of the administrative barring out of news, ourpublic has actually grown a little educated and reflective since the war began. It is fair to say that the more idealisticof our expansionists have put this forward from the outset as one"},{"pageNumber":1200,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1131 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 28]Page 1131chief reason why the Islands should be annexed. We were remaining too provincial-minded, they said, here in theUnited States, and this new responsibility would cultivate our consciousness of international affairs. But theconsciousness which the experience has cultivated is a consciousness that all the anti-imperialistic prophecies wereright. One by one we have seen them punctually fulfilled:—The material ruin of the Islands; the transformation ofnative friendliness to execration; the demoralization of our army, from the war office down—forgery decorated,torture whitewashed, massacre condoned; the creation of a chronic anarchy in the Islands, with ladronism stillsmouldering, and the lives of American travelers and American sympathizers unsafe in the country out of sight ofarmy posts; the deliberate reinflaming on our part of ancient tribal animosities, the arming of Igorrote savages andMacabebe semi-savages, too low to have a national consciousness, to help us hunt the highest portions of thepopulation down; the inoculation of Manila with a floating Yankee scum; these things, I say, or things like them, werethings which everyone with any breadth of understanding clearly foretold; while the incapacity of our public fortaking the slightest interest in anything so far away was from the outset a foregone conclusion.It is only fair to President McKinley and his coadjutors and successor to say that their better angels also had a fingerin the pie, and that the institution of our civil commission has gone far toward redeeming our national reputation forgood sense. The only trouble is that this agency has come too late for any solid success. We are trying to do with ourright hand what with our left hand, the army, we had made impossible in advance. When we landed at Manila wefound a passionate native cordiality, which would have met us half way in almost any scheme of protectorate and co-operation which we might have proposed. But, 'like the base Indian,' we threw that pearl of a psychological momentaway, and embarked, callous and cold, and business-like, as we flattered ourselves, upon our sinister plan of apreliminary military deglutition of them, just to show them what 'Old Glory' meant. Let our civil commission do whatit will now, the hands will not move backward on the dial, the day of genuine co-operation with the"},{"pageNumber":1201,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1132 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 28]Page 1132Filipinos is forever past. We cannot even be certain that the well-meaning commission will be anything but what thearmy thinks it, a sop to sentimentalists at home, and in the Islands a safe cover for the treacherous natives to hatch anew rebellion out.This, then, is where we are today. The first act is over, and what is done can't be undone. Difficult as it is to keep hotwords of accusation from rising to our lips whenever we think of the men who threw away so splendid an Americanopportunity—threw it away with our own action in the Cuba case before us as the only precedent we had to follow,—nevertheless it is bad politics to dwell too long upon events of yesterday. We opponents of an imperialist policy mustsimply hand over our brief for the past to the historians' keeping,—the historians who are already at work upon thechronicle, and who will shape the verdict of posterity upon the whole affair. We have made their labors easier. Timewill unwind yet many a secret, but our Secretary and his fellow-workers have let few facts now attainable escape theirchannels of publicity, and for that service to truth they deserve our heartiest thanks.Let us drop yesterday and its sins, then, and forget them. The attitude of 'I told you so' is sterile, and wise men knowwhen to change their tune. To the ordinary citizen the word anti-imperialist suggests a thin-haired being just waked upfrom the day before yesterday, brandishing the Declaration of Independence excitedly, and shrieking after a railroadtrain thundering toward its destination to turn upon its tracks and come back. Anti-imperialism, people think, issomething petrified, a religion, a thing that results in martyrdom, for which to 'discuss' means only to prophesy anddenounce. If, so far, some of us have struck a slightly monotonous attitude, we have our good excuse. The woundswhich our love of country received in those days of February, 1899, are of a kind that do not quickly heal. They achetoo persistently to allow us easily to forget. Forget we must, however, we must attend to the practical possibilities oftoday.And what are they?

It seems even doubtful whether it would be for the Islands' interest to haveour government immediately withdraw. What they need now is quiet for a few years, time to repair war's ravages, andto acquire some habits of administration which might outlast our stay. Not today, then, but tomorrow, is what weought to work for—abandonment of the islands as soon as, in our delicious phraseology, we have made them 'fit,' andmeanwhile as steady a pressure as we can bring to bear towards determining our people to face that prospect, andtowards making Congress say the decisive word.The Democrats have already espoused our principles, and many of us think, therefore, that the one thing left for us isto espouse the Democratic cause. Against this there is the objection that the Democrats are only half sincere in thematter—it is largely an opposition issue to gain the independent vote—and there is the still stronger objection that theRepublicans themselves have not half made up their minds that the Islands ought to be retained. The better self of theRepublicans, their subliminal consciousness, so to speak, is already on our side. The party was railroaded into itsconquistadore career by the McKinley administration. The war short-circuited political reflection, and we had first ofall to back up the Flag. But we may be sure that today the state of mind, even of our leaders, is full of misgivings, andthat if we don't put them too much on the defensive, time will do our work.The vital fact of the situation for us is that neither presidents nor Congress have as yet dared to face the responsibilityof making any permanent colonial professions to which in pride or consistency we might find ourselves obliged to liveup. Our adventure has literally been a wayward spree of power, wholly detached from any definite policy or plan. Theinstinct for self-preservation which in this had ruled us, is wiser far than a greater sense for national dignity wouldhave been. The policy of drift has never been abandoned. If we should grant the Islands independence tomorrow, noman could show a scrap of paper to prove that we had broken a pledge to anybody, or had backed out of a singleclause in our program."},{"pageNumber":1203,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1134 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 29]Page 1134Our tactics in this situation, Mr. Chairman, would therefore seem to be the simplest in the world. We mustindividually do all we can to circulate two phrases, so that the public ear becomes inured—''Independence for thePhilippine Islands,\" and \"Treat the Filipinos like the Cubans,\" and we must do all we can to force the hands of bothparties to a positive declaration before its next presidential campaign. The Republicans will certainly not make adeclaration for perpetual retention, and every open shying from that issue helps public opinion the other way. Constantdropping wears the marble. Phrases repeated have a way of turning into facts.I hope you have not all forgotten the great speech on 'Public Opinion' which Wendell Phillips made in 1852. Read itagain, anyhow, for it is full of inspiration for us here. \"Hearts and sentiments are alive,\" said Phillips, \"and we knowthat the gentlest of Nature's growths or motions will in time burst asunder or wear away the proudest dead-weight mancan put upon them. You may build your capitol of granite, and pile it as high as the Rocky Mountains, but if it isfounded on or mixed up with iniquity, the pulse of a girl will in time beat it down This heart of mine, which beats souninterruptedly in the bosom, if its force could be directed against a granite pillar, would wear it to dust in the courseof a man's life. Your capitol, Daniel Webster,\" continued Phillips—if he had been speaking here he would have usedother names—\"Your capitol is marble, but the pulse of every humane man is beating against it. God will give us timeand the pulses of men shall beat it down. The day must be ours, thank God, for the hearts, the hearts, are on our side.\"Phillips's era saw the heart of man in perhaps a little simpler light than we can. We used to believe then that we wereof a different clay from other nations, that there was something deep in the American heart that answered to our happybirth, free from the hereditary burden which the nations of Europe bear, and which obliges them to grow by preyingon their neighbors. Idle dream! pure Fourth of July fancy, scattered in five minutes by the first temptation. In everynational soul there lie potentialities of the most barefaced piracy, and our own American soul is no exception to therule.

It is good to rid ourselves of cant and humbug, and to know the truth aboutourselves. Political virtue does not follow geographical divisions. It follows the eternal division inside of each countrybetween the moral animal and the more intellectual kind of men, between the tory and the liberal tendencies, thejingoism and animal instinct that would run things by main force and brute possession, and the critical conscience thatbelieves in educational methods and in rational rules of right.As a group of citizens calling to our country to return to the principles which it was suckled in, I believe that we Anti-Imperialists are already a back number. We had better not print that name upon our publications any longer. Thecountry has once for all regurgitated the Declaration of Independence and the Farewell Address, and it won't swallowagain immediately what it is so happy to have vomited up. It has come to a hiatus. It has deliberately pushed itself intothe circle of international hatreds, and joined the common pack of wolves. It relishes the attitude. We have thrown offour swaddling clothes, it thinks, and attained our majority. We are objects of fear to other lands. This makes of the oldliberalism and the new liberalism of our country two discontinuous things. The older liberalism was in office, the newis in the opposition. Inwardly it is the same spirit, but outwardly the tactics, the questions, the reasons, and the phraseshave to change. American memories no longer serve as catchwords. The great international and cosmopolitan liberalparty, the party of conscience and intelligence the world over, has, in short, absorbed us; and we are only its Americansection, carrying on the war against the powers of darkness here, playing our part in the long, long campaign for truthand fair dealing which must go on in all the countries of the world until the end of time. Let us cheerfully settle intoour interminable task. Everywhere it is the same struggle under various names,—light against darkness, right againstmight, love against hate.

Already the prophecy is fulfilling itself in adazzling manner. Chicago has a School of Thought!—a school of thought which, it is safe to predict, will figure inliterature as the School of Chicago for twenty-five years to come. Some universities have plenty of thought to show,but no school; others plenty of school, but no thought. The University of Chicago, by its Decennial Publications,shows real thought and a real school. Professor John Dewey, and at least ten of his disciples, have collectively put intothe world a statement, homogenous in spite of so may coöperating minds, of a view of the world, both theoretical andpractical, which is so simple, massive, and positive that, in spite of the fact that many parts of it yet need to be workedout, it deserves the title of a new system of philosophy. If it be as true as it is original, its publication must bereckoned an important event. The present reviewer, for one, strongly suspects it of being true.The briefest characterization is all that will be attempted here. Criticism from various quarters will doubtless follow,for about the new system as a bone of contention discussion is bound to rage.Like Spencer's philosophy, Dewey's is an evolutionism; but unlike Spencer, Dewey and his disciples have so far (withthe exception of Dewey's admirable writings on ethics) confined themselves to establishing certain general principleswithout applying them to details. Unlike Spencer, again, Dewey is a pure empiricist. There is nothing real, whether11.

This is no Unknowable or Absolute behindor around the finite world. No Absolute, either, in the sense of anything eternally constant; no term is static, buteverything is process and change.Like Spencer, again, Dewey makes biology and psychology continuous. \"Life,\" or 'experience,' is the fundamentalconception; and whether you take it physically or mentally, it involves an adjustment between terms. Dewey's favoriteword is 'situation,' A situation implies at least two factors, each of which is both an independent variable and afunction of the other variable. Call them E (environment) and O (organism) for simplicity's sake. They interact anddevelop each other without end; for each action of E changes E, so that E's new action upon O gets different, elicitinga new reaction, and so, on indefinitely. The situation gets perpetually 'reconstructed,' to use another of ProfessorDewey's favorite words, and this reconstruction is the process of which all reality consists.I am in some doubt as to whether, in the last resort, Dewey thinks monistically or pluralistically of this reality. Heoften talks of 'experience' in the singular as if it were one universal process and not a collective name for manyparticular processes. But all his special statements refer to particular processes only, so I will report him in pluralisticterms.No biological process are treated of in this literature, except as incidental to ethical discussion, and the ethicaldiscussions would carry us too far afield. I will confine myself therefore to the psychological or epistemologicaldoctrines of the school.Consciousness is functionally active in readjustment. In perfectly 'adapted' situations, where adjustments are fluentand stereotyped, it exists in minimal degree. Only where there is hesitation, only where past habit will not run, do wefind that the situation awakens explicit thought. Thought is thus incidental to change in experience, to conflictbetween the old and new. The situation must be reconstructed if activity is to be resumed, and the rejudging of itmentally is the reconstruction's first stage. The nucleus of the Studies in Logical Theory becomes thus an account ofthe judging process."},{"pageNumber":1207,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1138 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 30]Page 1138\"In psychological terms we may say, in explanation of the judging process, that some stimulus to action has failed tofunction properly as a stimulus, and that the activity which was going on has been interrupted. Response in theaccustomed way has failed. In such a case there arises a division in experience into sensation content as subject andideal content as predicate. In other words, upon failure of the accustomed stimulus to be adequate activity ceases,and is resumed in an integral form only when a new habit is set up to which the new or altered stimulus is adequate. Itis in this process of reconstruction that subject and predicate appear.\" The old subject (the that of the situation) standsfor the interrupted habit, the new subject (the that with the new what added) stands for the new habit begun. Thepredicate is thus essentially hypothetical—the situations to which the use of it leads may have quickly to bereconstructed in turn. In brief, S is a stimulus intellectually irritating; P is an hypothesis in reponse; SP is a mentalaction, which normally is destined to lead or pass into action in a wider sense. The sense of 'objectivity' in the Semerges emphatically only when the P is problematic and the action undefined. Then only does the S arrest attention,and its contrast with the self become acute. 'Knowing,' therefore, or the conscious relation of the object to the self, isthus only an incident in the wider process of 'adjustment,' which includes unconscious adjustments as well.This leads Professor Dewey and his disciples to a peculiar view of 'fact.' What is a fact? A fact and a theory have notdifferent natures, as is usually supposed, the one being objective, the other subjective. They are both made of the samematerial, experience-material namely, and their difference relates to their way of functioning solely. What is fact forone epoch, or for one inquirer, is theory for another epoch or another inquirer. It is 'fact' when it functions steadily; itis 'theory' when we hesitate. 'Truth' is thus in process of formation like all other things. It consists not in conformity orcorrespondence with an externally fixed archetype or model. Such a thing would be irrelevant even if we knew it toexist. Truth consists in a character inclosed within the 'situation.' Whenever a situation has the maximum of stability,and seems most satisfactory to its own subject-factor, it is true for him."},{"pageNumber":1208,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1139 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 31]Page 1139If accused here of opening the door to systematic protagoreanism, Professor Dewey would reply that the concrete factsthemselves are what keep his scepticism from being systematic in any practically objectionable sense. Experience iscontinually enlarging, and the object-factors of our situations are always getting problematic, making old truthsunsatisfactory, and obliging new ones to be found. The object-factors moreover are common to ourselves and others;and our truths have to be mated with those of our fellow men. The real safeguard against caprice of statement andindetermination of belief is that there is a 'grain' in things against which we can't practically go. But as the graincreates itself from situation to situation, so the truth creates itself pari passu, and there is no eternally standing systemof extra-subjective verity to which our judgments, ideally and in advance of the facts, are obliged to conform.There are two great gaps in the system, which none of the Chicago writers have done anything to fill, and until theyare filled, the system, as a system, will appear defective. There is no cosmology, no positive account of the order ofphysical fact, as contrasted with mental fact, and no account of the fact (which I assume the writers to believe in) thatdifferent subjects share a common object-world. These lacunæ can hardly be inadvertent—we shall doubtless soonsee them filled in some way by one or another member of the school.I might go into much greater technical detail, and I might in particular make many a striking quotation. But I prefer tobe exceedingly summary, and merely to call the reader's attention to the importance of this output of ChicagoUniversity. Taking it en gros, what strikes me most in it is the great sense of concrete reality with which it is filled. Itseems a promising via media between the empiricist and transcendentalist tendencies of our time. Like empiricism, itis individualistic and phenomenalistic; it places truth in rebus, and not ante rem. It resembles transcendentalism, onthe other hand, in making value and fact inseparable, and in standing for continuities and purposes in things.

Philosophy, reflecting on the contrast, has varied in the past in herexplanations of it, and may be expected to vary in the future. At first, 'spirit and matter,' 'soul and body,' stood for apair of equipollent substances quite on a par in weight and interest. But one day Kant undermined the soul andbrought in the transcendental ego, and ever since then the bipolar relation has been very much off its balance. Thetranscendental ego seems nowadays in rationalist quarters to stand for everything, in empiricist quarters for almostnothing. In the hands of such writers as Schuppe, Rehmke, Natorp, Münsterberg—at any rate in his earlier writings,Schubert-Soldern and others, the spiritual principle attenuates itself to a thoroughly ghostly condition, being only aname for the fact that the 'content' of experience is known. It loses personal form and activity—these passing over tothe content—and becomes a bare Bewusstheit or Bewusstsein überhaupt, of which in its own right absolutely nothingcan be said.I believe that 'consciousness,' when once it has evaporated to this estate of pure diaphaneity, is on the point ofdisappearing altogether. It is the name of a nonentity, and has no right to a place among first principles. Those whostill cling to it are cling to a mere echo, the faint rumor left behind by the disappearing 'soul' upon the air ofphilosophy. During the past year, I have read a number of articles whose authors seemed just on the point ofabandoning the notion of consciousness,1 and substituting for it that of an absolute experience not due to two factors.But they were not quite radical enough, not quite daring enough in their negations. For twenty years past I havemistrusted 'consciousness' as an entity; for seven or eight years past I have suggested its non-existence to my students,and tried to give them its pragmatic1Articles by Baldwin, Ward, Bawden, King, Alexander and others.

It seems to me that the hour is ripe for it to be openly and universally discarded.To deny plumply that 'consciousness' exists seems so absurd on the face of it—for undeniably 'thoughts' do exist—thatI fear some readers will follow me no farther. Let me then immediately explain that I mean only to deny that the wordstands for an entity, but no insist most emphatically that it does stand for a function. There is, I mean, no aboriginalstuff or quality of being, contrasted with that of which material objects are made, out of which our thoughts of themare made; but there is a function in experience which thoughts perform, and for the performance of which this qualityof being is invoked. That function is knowing. 'Consciousness' is supposed necessary to explain the fact that things notonly are, but get reported, are known. Whoever blots out the notion of consciousness from his list of first principlesmust still provide in some way for that function's being carried on.IMy thesis is that if we start with the supposition that there is only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff ofwhich everything is composed, and if we call that stuff 'pure experience,' then knowing can easily be explained as aparticular sort of relation towards one another into which portions of pure experience may enter. The relation itself is apart of pure experience; one of its 'terms' becomes the subject or bearer of the knowledge, the knower,1 the otherbecomes the object known. This will need much explanation before it can be understood. The best way to get itunderstood is to contrast it with the alternative view; and for that we may make the recentest alternative, that in whichthe evaporation of the definite soul-substance has proceeded as far as it can go without being yet complete. If neo-Kantism has expelled earlier forms of dualism, we shall have expelled all forms if we are able to expel neo-Kantismin its turn.For the thinkers I call neo-Kantian, the word consciousness to-day does no more than signalize the fact thatexperience is indefeasibly dualistic in structure. It means that not subject,1In my 'Psychology' I have tried to show that we need no knower other than the 'passing thought.'"},{"pageNumber":1212,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1143 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 33]Page 1143not object, but object-plus-subject is the minimum that can actually be. The subject-object distinction meanwhile isentirely different from that between mind and matter, from that between body and soul. Souls were detachable, hadseparate destinies; things could happen to them. To consciousness as such nothing can happen, for, timeless itself, it isonly a witness of happenings in time, in which it plays no part. It is, in a word, but the logical correlative of 'content'in an Experience of which the peculiarity is that fact comes to light in it, that awareness of content takes place.Consciousness as such is entirely impersonal—'self' and its activities belong to the content. To say that I am self-conscious, or conscious of putting forth volition, means only that certain contents, for which 'self' and 'efforts of will'are the names, are not without witness as they occur.Thus, for these belated drinkers at the Kantian spring, we should have to admit consciousness as an 'epistemological'necessity, even if we had no direct evidence of its being there.But in addition to this, we are supposed by almost every one to have an immediate consciousness of consciousnessitself. When the world of outer fact ceases to be materially present, and we merely recall it in memory, or fancy, it, theconsciousness is believed to stand out and to be felt as a kind of impalpable inner flowing, which, once known in thissort of experience, may equally be detected in presentations of the outer world. \"The moment we try to fix ourattention upon consciousness and to see what, distinctly, it is,\" says a recent writer, \"it seems to vanish. It seems as ifwe had before us a mere emptiness. When we try to introspect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue; theother element is as if it were diaphanous. Yet it can be distinguished, if we look attentively enough, and know thatthere is something to look for.\"1 \"Consciousness\" (Bewusstheit), says another philosopher, \"is inexplicable and hardlydescribable, yet all conscious experiences have this in common that we call their content has this peculiar reference toa center for which 'self' is the name, in virtue of which reference alone the content is subjectively given, or appears.

Theexistence of consciousness, although it is the fundamental fact of psychology, can indeed be laid down as certain, canbe brought out by analysis, but can neither be defined nor deduced from anything but itself.''1'Can be brought out of analysis,' this author says. This supposes that the consciousness is one element, moment, factor—call it what you like—of an experience of essentially dualistic inner constitution, from which, if you abstract thecontent, the consciousness will remain revealed to its own eye. Experience, at this rate, would be much like a paint ofwhich the world pictures were made. Paint has a dual constitution, involving, as it does, a menstruum2 (oil, size orwhat not) and a mass of content in the form of pigment suspended therein. We can get the pure menstruum by lettingthe pigment settle, and the pure pigment by pouring off the size or oil. We operate here by physical subtraction; andthe usual view is, that by mental subtraction we can separate the two factors of experience in an analogous way—notisolating them entirely, but distinguishing them enough to know that they are two.IINow my contention is exactly the reverse of this. Experience, I believe, has no such inner duplicity; and theseparation of it into consciousness and content comes, not by way of subtraction, but by way of addition—theaddition, to a given concrete piece of it, of other sets of experiences, in connection with which severally its use orfunction may be of two different kinds. The paint will also serve here as an illustration. In a pot in a paint-shop, alongwith other paints, it serves in its entirety as so much saleable matter.

Just so, Imaintain, does a given undivided portion of experience, taken in one context of associates, play the part of a knower,of a state of mind, of 'consciousness'; while in a different context the same undivided bit of experience plays the partof a thing known, of an objective 'content.' In a word, in one group it figures as a thought, in another group as a thing.And, since it can figure in both groups simultaneously we have every right to speak of it as subjective and objectiveboth at once. The dualism connoted by such double-barrelled terms as 'experience,' 'phenomenon,' 'datum,''Vorfindung'—terms which, in philosophy at any rate, tend more and more to replace the single-barrelled terms of'thought' and 'thing'—that dualism, I say, is still preserved in this account, but reinterpreted, so that, instead of beingmysterious and elusive, it becomes verifiable and concrete. It is an affair of relations, it falls outside, not inside, thesingle experience considered, and can always be particularized and defined.The entering wedge for this more concrete way of understanding the dualism was fashioned by Locke when he madethe world 'idea' stand indifferently for thing and thought, and by Berkeley when he said that what common sensemeans by realities is exactly what the philosopher means by ideas. Neither Locke nor Berkeley thought his truth outinto perfect clearness, but it seems to me that the conception I am defending does little more than consistently carryout the 'pragmatic' method which they were the first to use.If the reader will take his own experience, he will see what I mean. Let him begin with a perceptual experience, the'presentation,' so called, of a physical object, his actual field of vision, the room he sits in, with the book he is readingas its center; and let him for the present treat this complex object in the common-sense way as being 'really' what itseems to be, namely, a collection of physical things cut out from an environing world of other physical things withwhich these physical things have actual or potential relations. Now at the same time it is just those self-same thingswhich his mind, as we say, perceives; and the whole philosophy of perception from Democritus's time downwards hasbeen just one long"},{"pageNumber":1215,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1146 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 35]Page 1146wrangle over the paradox that what is evidently one reality should be in two places at once, both in outer space and ina person's mind. 'Representative' theories of perception avoid the logical paradox, but on the other hand they violatethe reader's sense of life, which knows no intervening mental image but seems to see the room and the bookimmediately just as they physically exist.The puzzle of how the one identical room can be in two places is at bottom just the puzzle of how one identical pointcan be on two lines. It can, if it be situated at their intersection; and similarly, if the 'pure experience' of the roomwere a place of intersection of two processes, which connected it with different groups of associates respectively, itcould be counted twice over, as belonging to either group, and spoken of loosely as existing in two places, although itwould remain all the time a numerically single thing.Well, the experience is a member of diverse processes that can be followed away from it along entirely different lines.The one self-identical thing has so many relations to the rest of experience that you can take it in disparate systems ofassociation, and treat it as belonging with opposite contexts. In one of these contexts it is your 'field of consciousness';in another it is 'the room in which you sit,' and it enters both contexts in its wholeness, giving no pretext for being saidto attach itself to consciousness by one of its parts or aspects, and to outer reality by another. What are the twoprocesses, now, into which the room-experience simultaneously enters in this way?One of them is the reader's personal biography, the other is the history of the house of which the room is part. Thepresentation, the experience, the that in short (for until we have decided what it is it must be a mere that) is the lastterm of a train of sensations, emotions, decisions, movements, classifications, expectations, etc., ending in the present,and the first term of a series of similar 'inner' operations extending into the future, on the reader's part. On the otherhand, the very same that is the terminus ad quem of a lot of previous physical operations, carpentering, papering,furnishing, warming, etc., and the terminus a quo of a lot of future ones, in which it will be concerned whenundergoing the destiny of"},{"pageNumber":1216,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1147 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 36]Page 1147a physical room. The physical and the mental operations form curiously incompatible groups. As a room, theexperience has occupied that spot and had that environment for thirty years. As your field of consciousness it maynever have existed until now. As a room, attention will go on to discover endless new details in it. As your mentalstate merely, few new ones will emerge under attention's eye. As a room, it will take an earth-quake, or a gang ofmen, and in any case a certain amount of time, to destroy it. As your subjective state, the closing of your eyes, or anyinstantaneous play of your fancy will suffice. In the real world, fire will consume it. Ink your mind, you can let fireplay over it without effect. As an outer object, you must pay so much a month to inhabit it. As an inner content, youmay occupy it for any length of time rent-free. If, in short, you follow it in the mental direction, taking it along withevents of personal biography solely, all sorts of things are true of it which are false, and false of it which are true ifyou treat it as a real thing experienced, follow it in the physical direction, and relate it to associates in the outer world.IIISo far, al seems pain sailing, but my thesis will probably grow less plausible to the reader when I pass from perceptsto concepts, or from the case of things presented to that of things remote. I believe, nevertheless, that here also thesame law holds good. If we take conceptual manifolds, or memories, or fancies, they also are in their first intentionmere bits of pure experience, and, as such, are single thats which act in one context as objects, and in another contextfigure as mental sates. By taking them in their first intention, I mean ignoring their relation to possible perceptualexperiences with which they may be connected, which they may lead to and terminate in, and which then they may besupposed to 'represent.' Taking them in this way first, we confine the problem to a world merely 'thought-of' and notdirectly felt or seen. This world, just like the world of percepts, comes to us at first as a chaos of experiences, butlines of order soon get traced. We find that any bit of it which we may cut out as an example in connected withdistinct groups of associates, just as our perceptual experiences are, that these associates link themselves with it by"},{"pageNumber":1217,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1148 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 36]Page 1148different relations,1 and that one forms the inner history of a person, while the other acts as an impersonal 'objective'world, either spatial and temporal, or else merely logical or mathematical, or otherwise 'ideal.'The first obstacle on the part of the reader to seeing that these non-perceptual experiences have objectivity as well assubjectivity will probably be due to the intrusion into his mind of percepts, that third group of associates with whichthe non-perceptual experiences have relations, and which, as a whole, the 'represent' standing to them as thoughts tothings. This important function of the non-perceptual experiences complicates the question and confuses it; for, soused are we to treat percepts as the sole genuine realities that, unless we keep them out of the discussion. we tendaltogether to overlook the objectivity that lies in non-perceptual experience by themselves. We treat them, 'knowing'percepts as they do, as through and through subjective, and say that they are wholly constituted of the stuff calledconsciousness, using this term now for a kind of entity, after the fashion which I am seeking to refute.2Abstracting, then, from percepts altogether, what I maintain is, that any single non-perceptual experience tends to getcounted twice over, just as a perceptual experience does, figuring in one context as an object or field of object or fieldof objects, in another as a state of mind: and all this without the least internal self-diremption on its own part intoconsciousness and content. It is all consciousness in one taking; and, in the other, all content.I find this objectivity of non-perceptual experiences, this complete parallelism in point of reality between the presentlyfelt and the remotely thought, so well set forth in a gape of Münsterberg's 'Grundzüge,' that I will quote it as it stands.\"I may only think of my objects,\" says Professor Münsterberg; \"yet, in my living thought they stand before me exactly1Here as elsewhere the relations are of course experienced relations, members of the same originally chaotic manifold of non-perceptualexperience of which the related terms themselves are parts.2Of the representative function of non-perceptual experience as a whole, I will say a word in a subsequent article: it leads too far into thegeneral theory of knowledge for much to be said about it in a short paper like this."},{"pageNumber":1218,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1149 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 37]Page 1149as perceived objects would do, no matter how different the two ways of apprehending them may be in their genesis.The book here lying on the table before me, and the book in the next room of which I think and which I mean to get,are both in the same sense given realities for me, realities which I acknowledge and of which I take account. If youagree that the perceptual object is not an idea within me, but that percept and thing, as indistinguishably one, arereally experienced there, outside, you ought not to believe that the merely thought-of object is hid away inside of thethinking subject. The object of which I think,and of whose existence I take cognizance without letting it now workupon my senses, occupies its definite place in the outer world as much as does the object which I directly see.\"What is true of the here and the there, is also true of the now and the ten. I know of the thing which is present andperceived, but I know also of the thing which yesterday was but is no more, and which I only remember. Both candetermine my present conduct, both are parts of the reality of which I keep account.It is true that of much of the past Iam uncertain, just as I am uncertain of much of what is present if it be but dimly perceived. But the interval of timedoes not in principle alter my relation to the object, does not transform it from an object known into a mental state. The things in the room here which I survey, and those in my distant home of which I think, the things of this minuteand those of my long-vanished boyhood, influence and decide me alike, with a reality which my experience of themdirectly, feels. They both make up my real world, they make it directly, they do not have first to be introduced to meand mediated by ideas which now and here arise within me. This not-me character of my recollections andexpectations does not imply that the external objects of which I am aware in those experiences should necessarily bethere also for others. The objects of dreamers and hallucinated persons are wholly without general validity. But evenwere they centaurs and golden mountains, they still would be 'off there,' in fairy land, and not 'inside' of ourselves.\"11'Grundzüge der Psychologie,' Vol. I., p. 48."},{"pageNumber":1219,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1150 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 37]Page 1150This certainly is the immediate, primary, naïf, or practical way of taking our thought-of world. Were there noperceptual world to serve as its 'reductive,' in Taine's sense, by being 'stronger' and more genuinely 'outer' (so that thewhole merely thought-of world seems weak and inner in comparison), our world of thought would be the only world,and would enjoy complete reality in our belief. This actually happens in our dreams, and in our day-dreams so long aspercepts do not interrupt them.And yet, just as the seen room (to go back to our late example) is also a field of consciousness, so the conceived orrecollected room is also a state of mind; and the doubling-up of the experience has in both cases similar grounds.The room thought-of, namely, has many thought-of couplings with many thought-of things. Some of these couplingsare inconstant, others are stable. In the reader's personal history the room occupies a single date—he saw it only onceperhaps, a year ago. Of the house's history, on the other hand, it forms a permanent ingredient. Some couplings havethe curious stubbornness, to borrow Royce's term, of fact; others show the fluidity of fancy—we let them come and goas we please. Grouped with the rest of its house, with the name of its town, of its owner, builder, value, decorativeplan, the room maintains a definite foothold, to which, if we try to loosen it, it tends to return, and to reassert itselfwith force.1 With these associates, in a word, it coheres, while to other houses, other towns, other owners, etc., itshows no tendency to cohere at all. The two collections, first of its cohesive, and, second, of its loose associates,inevitably come to be contrasted. We call the first collection the system of external realities, in the midst of which theroom, as 'real,' exists; the other we call the stream of our internal thinking, in which, as a 'mental image,' it for amoment floats.2 The room thus1Cf. A. L. Hodder: 'The Adversaries of the Skeptic,' N. Y., 1899, pp. 94 99.2For simplicity's sake I confine my exposition to 'external' reality. But there is also the system of ideal reality in which the room plays itspart. Relations of comparison, of classification, serial order, value, also are stubborn, assign a definite place to the room, unlike theincoherence of its places in the mere rhapsody of our successive thoughts."},{"pageNumber":1220,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1151 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 38]Page 1151again gets counted twice over. It plays two different rôles, being Gedanke and Gedachtes, the thought-of-an-object,and the object-thought-of, both in one; ;and all this without paradox or mystery, just as the same material thing maybe both low and high, or small and great, or bad and good, because of its relations to opposite parts of an environingworld.As 'subjective' we say that the experience represents; as 'objective' it is represented. What represents and what isrepresented is here numerically the same; but we must remember that no dualism of being represented andrepresenting resides in the experience per se. In its pure state, or when isolated, there is no self-splitting of it intoconsciousness and what the consciousness is 'of.' Its subjectivity and objectivity are functional attributes solely,realized only when the experience is 'taken,' i.e., talked-of, twice, considered along with its two differing contextsrespectively, by a new retrospective experience, of which that whole past complication now forms the fresh content.The instant field of the present is at all times what I call the 'pure' experience. It is only virtually or potentially eitherobject or subject as yet. For the time being, it is plain, unqualified actuality or existence, a simple that. In this naïfimmediacy it is of course valid; it is there, we act upon it; and the doubling of it in retrospection into a state of mindand a reality intended thereby, is just one of the acts. The 'state of mind,' first treated explicitly as such inretrospection, will stand corrected or confirmed, and the retrospective experience in its turn will get a similartreatment; but the immediate experience in its passing is always 'truth,'1 practical truth, something to act on, at its ownmovement. If the world were then and there to go out like a candle, it would remain truth absolute and objective, for itwould be 'the last word,' would have no critic, and no one would ever oppose the thought in it to the reality intended.21Note the ambiguity of this term, which is taken sometimes objectively and sometimes subjectively.2In the Psychological Review for July of this year, Dr. R. B. Perry has published a view of Consciousness which comes nearer to mine thanany other with which I am acquainted. As Present, Dr. Perry thinks, every field of experience is so much 'fact.' It becomes 'opinion' or'thought' only in retro-(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":1221,"pageContent":" Page 1152I think I may now claim to have made my thesis clear. Consciousness connotes a kind of external relation, and doesnot denote a special stuff or way of being. The peculiarity of our experiences, that they not only are, but are known,which their 'conscious' quality is invoked to explain, is better explained by their relations—these relations themselvesbeing experiences—to one another.IVWere I now to go on to treat of the knowing of perceptual by conceptual experiences, it would again prove to be anaffair of external relations. One experience would be the knower, the other the reality known; and I could perfectlywell define, without the notion of 'consciousness,' what the knowing actually and practically amounts to—leading-towards, namely, and terminating-in percepts, through a series of transitional experiences which the world supplies.But I will not treat of this, space being insufficient.1 I will rather consider a few objections that are sure to be urgedagainst the entire theory as it stands.VFirst of all, this will be asked: \"If experience has not 'conscious' existence, if it be not partly made of 'consciousness,'of what then is it made? Matter we know, and thought we know, and conscious content we know, but neutral andsimple 'pure experience' is something we know not at all. Say what it consists of—for it must consist of something—or be willing to give it up!\"To this challenge the reply is easy. Although for fluency's(Footnote continued from previous page)spection, when a fresh experience, thinking the same object, alters and corrects it. But the corrective experience becomes itself in turncorrected, and thus experience as a whole is a process in which what is objective originally forever turns subjective, turns into ourapprehension of the object. I strongly recommend Dr. Perry's admirable article to my readers.1I have given a partial account of the matter in Mind, Vol. X., p. 27, 1885, and in the Psychological Review, Vol. II., p. 105, 1895. See alsoC.A. Strong's article in the JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY, PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS, Vol. I., p. 253, May 12, 1904. I hope myselfvery soon to recur to the matter in this JOURNAL."},{"pageNumber":1222,"pageContent":" Page 1153sake I myself spoke early in this article of a stuff of pure experience, I have now to say that there in no general stuffof which experience at large is made. There are as many stuffs as there are 'natures' in the things experienced. If youask what any one bit of pure experience is made of, the answer is always the same: \"It is made of that, of just whatappears, of space, of intensity, of flatness, brownness, heaviness, or what not.\" Shadworth Hodgson's analysis hereleaves nothing to be desired. Experience is only a collective name for all these sensible natures, and save for time andspace (and, if you like, for 'being') there appears no universal element of which all things are made.VIThe next objection is more formidable, in fact is sounds quite crushing when one hears it first.\"If it be the self-same piece of pure experience, taken twice over, that serves now as thought and now as thing\"—sothe objections runs—\"how comes it that its attributes should differ so fundamentally in the two takings. As thing, theexperience is extended; ;as though, it occupies no space or place. As thing, it is red, hard, heavy; but who ever heardof a red, hard or heavy thought? Yet even now you said that an experience is made of just what appears, and whatappears is just such adjectives. How can the one experience in its thing-function be made of them, consist of them,carry them as its own attributes, while in its thought-function it disowns them and attributes them elsewhere. There isa self-contradiction here from which the radical dualism of thought and thing is the only truth that can save us. Onlyif the thought is one kind of being can the adjectives exist in it 'intentionally' (to use the scholastic term); only if thething is another kind, can they exist in it constitutively and energetically. No simple subject can take the sameadjectives and at one time be qualified by it, and at another time be merely 'of' it, as of something only meant orknown.\"The solution insisted on by this objector,like many other common-sense solutions, grows the less satisfactory the moreone turns it in one's mind. To begin with, are thought and thing as heterogenous as is commonly said?"},{"pageNumber":1223,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1154 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 39]Page 1154No one denies that they have some categories in common. Their relations to time are identical. Both, moreover, mayhave parts (for psychologists in general treat thoughts as having them); and both may be complex or simple. Both areof kinds, can be compared, added and subtracted and arranged in serial orders. All sorts of adjectives qualify ourthoughts which appear incompatible with consciousness being, as such, a bare diaphaneity. For instance, they arenatural and easy, or laborious. They are beautiful, happy, intense, interesting, wise, idiotic, focal, marginal, insipid,confused, vague, precise, rational, casual, general, particular, and many things besides. Moreover, the chapters on'Perception' in the Psychology-books are full of facts that make for the essential homogeneity of thought with thing.How, if 'subject' and 'object' were separated 'by the whole diameter of being,' and had no attributes in common, couldit be so hard to tell, in a presented and recognized material object, what part comes in thought the sense-organs andwhat part comes 'out of one's own head'? Sensations and imperceptive ideas fuse here so intimately that you can nomore tell where one begins and the other ends, than you can tell, in those cunning circular panoramas that have latelybeen exhibited, where the real fore-ground and the painted canvas join together.1Descartes for the first time defined thought as the absolutely unextended, and later philosophers have accepted thedescription as correct. But what possible meaning has it to say that, when we think of a foot-rule or a square yard,extension is not attributable to our thought? Of every extended object theadequate mental picture must have all theextension of the object itself. The difference between objective and subjective extension is one of relation to a contextsolely. In the mind the various extents maintain no necessarily stubborn order relatively to each other, while in thephysical world they bound each other stably, and, added together, make the great enveloping Unit which we believe inand call real Space. As1Spencer's proof of his 'Transfigured Realism' (his doctrine that there is an absolutely non-mental reality) comes to mind as a splendidinstance of the impossibility of establishing radical heterogeneity between thought and thing. All his painfully accumulated points ofdifference run gradually into their opposites, and are full of exceptions."},{"pageNumber":1224,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1155 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 39]Page 1155'outer,' they carry themselves adversely, so to speak, to one another, exclude one another and maintain their distances;while, as 'inner,' their order is loose, and they form a durcheinander in which unity is lost.1 But to argue from this thatinner experience is absolutely inextensive seems to me little short of absurd. The two worlds differ, not by thepresence or absence of extension, but by the relations of the extensions which in both worlds exist.Does not this case of extension now put us on the track of truth in the case of other qualities? It does; and I amsurprised that the facts should not have been noticed long ago. Why, for example, do we call a fire hot, and waterwet, and yet refuse to say that our mental state, when it is 'of' these objects, is either wet or hot? 'Intentionally,' at anyrate, and when the mental state is a vivid image, hotness and wetness are in it just as much as they are in the physicalexperience. The reason is this, that, as the general chaos of all our experiences gets sifted, we find that there are somefires that will always burn sticks and always warm our bodies, and that there are some waters that will always put outfires; while there are other fires and waters that will not act at all. The general group of experiences that act, that donot only possess their natures intrinsically, but wear them adjectively and energetically, turning them against oneanother, comes inevitably to be contrasted with the group whose members, having identically the same natures, fail tomanifest them in the 'energetic' way. I make for myself now an experience of blazing fire; I place it near my body; butit does not warm me in the least. I lay a stick upon it, and the stick either burns or remains green, as I please. I call upwater, and pour it on the fire, and absolutely no difference ensues. I account for all such facts by calling this wholetrain of experiences unreal, a mental train. Mental fire is what won't burn real sticks; mental water is what won'tnecessarily (though of course it may) put out even a mental fire. Mental knives may be sharp, but they won't cut realwood. Mental triangles are pointed, but their points won't wound. With 'real' objects, on the contrary, con-1I speak here of the complete inner life in which the mind plays freely with its materials. Of course the mind's free play is restrictedwhen it seeks to copy real things in real space."},{"pageNumber":1225,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1156 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 40]Page 1156sequences always accrue; and thus the real experiences get sifted from the mental ones, the things from our thoughtsof them, fanciful or true, and precipitated together as the stable part of the whole experience-chaos, under the name ofthe physical world. Of this our perceptual experiences are the nucleus, they being the originally strong experiences.We add a lot of conceptual experiences to them, making these strong also in imagination, and building out the remoterparts of the physical world by their means; and around this core of reality the world of laxly connected fancies andmere rhapsodical objects floats like a bank of clouds. In the clouds, all sorts of rules are violated which in the core arekept. Extensions there can be indefinitely located; motion there obeys no Newton's laws.VIIThere is a peculiar class of experiences to which, whether we take them as subjective or as objective, we assign theirseveral natures as attributes,because in both contexts they affect their associates actively, though in neither quite as'strongly' or as sharply as things affect one another by their physical energies. I refer here to appreciations, whichform an ambiguous sphere of being, belonging with emotion on the one hand, and having objective 'value' on theother, yet seeming not quite inner nor quite outer, as if a diremption had begun but had not made itself complete.Experiences of painful objects, for example, are usually also painful experiences; perceptions of loveliness, ofugliness, tend to pass muster as lovely or as ugly perceptions; intuitions of the morally lofty are lofty intuitions.Sometimes the adjective wanders as if uncertain where to fix itself. Shall we speak of seductive visions or of visionsof seductive things? Of wicked desires or of desires for wickedness? Of healthy thoughts or of thoughts of healthyobjects? Of good impulses, or of impulses towards the good? Of feelings of anger, or of angry feelings? Both in themind and in the thing, these natures modify their context, exclude certain associates and determine others, have theirmates and incompatibles. Yet not as stubbornly as in the case of physical qualities, for beauty"},{"pageNumber":1226,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1157 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 40]Page 1157and ugliness, love and hatred, pleasant and painful can, in certain complex experiences, coexist.If one were to make an evolutionary construction of how a lot of originally chaotic pure experiences becamegradually differentiated into an orderly inner and outer world, the whole theory would turn upon one's success inexplaining how or why the quality of an experience, once active, could become less so, and, from being an energeticattribute in some cases, elsewhere lapse into the status of an inert or merely internal 'nature.' This would be the'evolution' of the psychical from the bosom of the physical, in which the esthetic, moral and otherwise emotionalexperiences would represent a halfway stage.VIIIBut a last cry of non possumus will probably go up from many readers. ''All very pretty as a piece of ingenuity,\" theywill say, \"but our consciousness itself intuitively contradicts you. We, for our part, know that we are conscious. Wefeel our thought, flowing as a life within us, in absolute contrast with the objects which it so unremittingly escorts.We can not be faithless to this immediate intuition. The dualism is a fundamental datum: Let no man join what Godhas put asunder.\"My reply to this is my last word, and I greatly grieve that to many it will sound materialistic. I can not help that,however, for I, too, have my intuitions and I must obey them. Let the case be what it may in others, I am as confidentas I am of anything that, in myself, the stream of thinking (which I recognize emphatically as a phenomenon) is only acareless name for what, when scrutinized, reveals itself to consist chiefly of the stream of my breathing. The 'I think'which Kant said must be able to accompany all my objects, is the 'I breathe' which actually does accompany them.There are other internal facts besides breathing (intracephalic muscular adjustments, etc., of which I have said a wordin my larger Psychology), and these increase the assets of 'consciousness,' so far as the latter is subject to immediateperception; but breath, which was ever the original of 'spirit' breath moving"},{"pageNumber":1227,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1158 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 41]Page 1158outwards, between the glottis and the nostrils, is, I am persuaded, the essence out of which philosophers haveconstructed the entity known to them as consciousness. That entity is fictitious, while thoughts in the concrete are fullyreal. But thoughts in the concrete are made of the same stuff as things are.I wish I might believe myself to have made that plausible in this article.

Thedissatisfaction with these seems due for the most part to a feeling that they are too abstract and academic. Life isconfused and superabundant, and what the younger generation appears to crave is more of the temperament of life inits philosophy, even though it were at some cost of logical vigor and of formal purity. Transcendental idealism isinclining to let the world wag incomprehensibly, in spite of its Absolute Subject and his unity of purpose. Berkeleyanidealism is abandoning the principle of parsimony and dabbling in panpsychic speculations. Empiricism flirts withteleology; and, strangest of all, natural realism, so long decently buried, raises its head above the turf, and finds gladhands outstretched from the most unlikely quarters to help it to its feet again. We are all biased by our personalfeelings, I know, and I am personally discontented with extant solutions, so I seem to read the signs of a greatunsettlement, as if the upheaval of more real conceptions and more fruitful methods were imminent, as if a truelandscape might result, less clipped, straight edged and artificial.If philosophy be really on the eve of any considerable rearrangement, the time should be propitious for any one whohas suggestions of his own to bring forward. For many years past my mind has been growing into a certain type ofWeltanschauung. Rightly or wrongly, I have got to the point where I can hardly see things in any other pattern. Ipropose, therefore, to describe the pattern as clearly as I can consistently with great brevity, and to throw mydescription into the bubbling vat of publicity where, jostled by rivals and torn by critics, it will eventually eitherdisappear from notice, or else, if better luck befall it, quietly subside to the profundities, and"},{"pageNumber":1229,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1160 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 42]Page 1160serve as a possible ferment of new growths or a nucleus of new crystallization.I. Radical EmpiricismI give the name of 'radical empiricism' to my Weltanschauung. Empiricism is known as the opposite of rationalism.Rationalism tends to emphasize universals and to make wholes prior to parts in the order of logic as well as in that ofbeing. Empiricism, on the contrary, lays the explanatory stress upon the part, the element, the individual, and treats thewhole as a collection and the universal as an abstraction. My description of things, accordingly, starts with the partsand makes of the whole a being of the second order. It is essentially a mosaic philosophy, a philosophy of pluralfacts, like that of Hume and his descendants, who refer these facts neither to Substances in which they inhere nor toan Absolute Mind that creates them as its objects. But it differs from the Humian type of empiricism in one particularwhich makes me add the epithet radical.To be radical, an empiricism must neither admit into its constructions any element that is not directly experienced, norexclude from them any element that is directly experienced. For such a philosophy, the relations that connectexperiences must themselves be experienced relations, and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as'real' as anything else in the system. Elements may indeed be redistributed, the original placing of things gettingcorrected, but a real place must be found for every kind of thing experienced, whether term or relation, in the finalphilosophic arrangement.Now, ordinary empiricism, in spite of the fact that conjunctive and disjunctive relations present themselves as beingfully coordinate parts of experience, has always shown a tendency to do away with the connections of things, and toinsist most on the disjunctions. Berkeley's nominalism, Hume's statement that whatever things we distinguish are as'loose and separate' as if they had 'no manner of connection,' James Mill's denial that similars have anything 'really' incommon, the resolution of the causal tie into habitual sequence, John Mill's account of both physical things and selvesas composed of discontinuous possibilities, and the general pulverization of"},{"pageNumber":1230,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1161 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 43]Page 1161all Experience by association and the mind-dust theory, are examples of what I mean.The natural result of such a world-picture has been the efforts of naturalism to correct its incoherencies by theaddition of trans-experiential agents of unification, substances, intellectual categories and powers, or Selves; whereas,if empiricism had only been radical and taken every thing that comes without disfavor, conjunction as well asseparation, each at its face value, the results would have called for no such artificial correction. Radical empiricism, asI understand it, does full justice to conjunctive relations, without, however, treating them as rationalism always tendsto treat them, as being true in some supernal way, as if the unity of things and their variety belonged to differentorders of truth and vitality altogether.II.Conjunctive RelationsRelations are of different degrees of intimacy. Merely to be 'with' one another in a universe of discourse is the mostexternal relation that terms can have, and seems to involve nothing whatever as to farther consequences. Simultaneityand time-interval come next, and then space-adjacency and distance. After them, similarity and difference, carryingthe possibility of many inferences. Then relations of activity, tying terms into series involving change, tendency,resistance, and the causal order generally. Finally, the relation experienced between terms that form states of mind,and are immediately conscious of continuing each other. The organization of the Self as a system of memories,purposes, strivings, fulfilments or disappointments, is incidental to this most intimate of all relations, the terms ofwhich seem in many cases actually to compenetrate and suffuse each other's being.Philosophy has always turned on grammatical particles. With, near, next, like, from, towards, against, because, for,through, my—these words designate types of conjunctive relation arranged in a roughly ascending order of intimacyand inclusiveness. A priori, we can imagine a universe of withness but no nextness; or one of nextness but nolikeness, or of likeness with no activity, or of activity with no purpose, or of purpose with no ego. These would beuniverse, each with its"},{"pageNumber":1231,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1162 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 43]Page 1162own grade of unity. The universe of human experience is, by one or another of its parts, of each and all these grades.Whether or not it possibly enjoys some still more absolute grade of union does not appear upon the surface.Taken as it does appear, our universe is to a large extent chaotic. No one single type of connection runs through allthe experiences that compose it. If we take space-relations, they fail to connect minds into any regular system. Causesand purposes obtain only among special series of facts. The self relation seems extremely limited and does not linktwo different selves together. Prima facie, if you should liken the universe of absolute idealism to an aquarium, acrystal globe in which goldfish are swimming, you would have to compare the empiricist universe to something morelike one of those dried human heads with which the Dyaks of Borneo deck their lodges. The skull forms a solidnucleus; but innumerable feathers, leaves, strings, beads, and loose appendices of every description float and danglefrom it, and save that they terminate in it, seem to have nothing to do with one another. Even so my experiences andyours float and dangle, terminating, it is true, in a nucleus of common perception, but for the most part out of sightand irrelevant and unimaginable to one another. This imperfect intimacy, this bare relation of withness between someparts of the sum total of experience and other parts, is the fact that ordinary empiricism overemphasizes againstrationalism, the latter always tending to ignore it unduly. Radical empiricism, on the contrary, is fair to both the unityand the disconnection. It finds no reason for treating either as illusory. It allots to each its definite sphere ofdescription, and agrees that there appear to be actual forces at work which tend, as time goes on, to make the unitygreater.The conjunctive relation that has given most trouble to philosophy is the co-conscious transition, so to call it, bywhich one experience passes into another when both belong to the same self. About the facts there is no question. Myexperiences and your experiences are 'with' each other in various external ways, but mine pass into mine, and yourspass into yours in a way in which yours and mine never pass into one another. Within each of our personal histories,subject, object, interest"},{"pageNumber":1232,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1163 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 44]Page 1163and purpose are continuous or may be continuous.1 Personal histories are processes of change in time, and the changeitself is one of the things immediately experienced. 'Change' in this case means continuous as opposed todiscontinuous transition. But continuous transition is one sort of a conjunctive relation; and to be a radical empiricistmeans to hold fast to this conjunctive relation of all others, for this is the strategic point, the position through which, ifa hole be made, all the corruptions of dialectics and all the metaphysical fictions pour into our philosophy. Theholding fast to this relation means taking it as its face value, neither less nor more; and to take it at its face valuemeans first of all to take it just as we feel it, and not to confuse ourselves with abstract talk about it, involving wordsthat drive us to invent secondary conceptions in order to neutralize their suggestions and to make our actualexperience again seem rationally possible.What I do feel simply when a later moment of my experience succeeds an earlier one is that though they are twomoments, the transition from the one to the other is continuous. Continuity here is a definite sort of experience; just asdefinite as is the discontinuity-experience which I find it impossible to avoid when I seek to make the transition froman experience of my own to one of yours. In this latter case I have to get on and off again, to pass from a thing livedto another thing only conceived, and the break is positively experienced and noted. Though the functions exerted bymy experience and by yours may be the same (e.g., the same objects known and the same purposes followed), yet thesameness has in this case to be ascertained expressly (and often with difficulty and uncertainty) after the break hasbeen felt; whereas in passing from one of my own moments to another the sameness of object and interest isunbroken, and both the earlier and the later experience are of things directly lived.There is no other nature, no other whatness than this absence of break and this sense of continuity in that mostintimate of all conjunctive relations, the passing of one1The psychology books have of late described the facts here with approximate adequacy. I may refer to the chapters on 'The Stream ofThought' and on the Self in my own 'Principles of Psychology,' as well as to S. H. Hodgson's 'Metaphysic of Experience,' Vol. I., Chap.VII. and VIII."},{"pageNumber":1233,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1164 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 44]Page 1164experience into another when they belong to the same self. And this whatness is real empirical 'content' just as thewhatness of separation and discontinuity is real content in the contrasted case. Practically to experience one's personalcontinuum in this living way is to know the originals of the ideas of continuity and of sameness, to know what thewords stand for concretely, to own all that they can ever mean. But all experiences have their conditions; and over-subtle intellects, thinking about the facts here, and asking how they are possible, have ended by substituting a lot ofstatic objects of conception for the direct perceptual experiences. \"Sameness,\" they have said, \"must be a starknumerical identity; it can't run on from next to next. Continuity can't mean mere absence of gap; for if you say twothings are in immediate contact, at the contact how can they be two? If, on the other hand, you put a relation oftransition between them, that itself is a third thing, and needs to be related or hitched to its terms. An infinite series isinvolved,\" and so on. The result is that from difficulty to difficulty, the plain conjunctive experience has beendiscredited by both schools, the empiricists leaving things permanently disjoined, and the rationalist remedying thelooseness by their Absolutes or Substances, or whatever other fictitious agencies of union they may have employed.From all which artificiality we can be saved by a couple of simple reflections: first, that conjunctions and separationsare, at all events, coordinate phenomena which, if we take experiences at their face value, must be accounted equallyreal; and second, that if we insist on treating things as really separate when they are given as continuously joined,invoking, when union is required, transcendental principles to overcome the separateness we have assumed, then weought to stand ready to perform the converse act. We ought to invoke higher principles of disunion also, to make ourmerely experienced disjunctions more truly real. Failing thus, we ought to let the originally given continuities stand ontheir own bottom. We have no right to be lopsided or to blow capriciously hot and cold.III. The Cognitive RelationThe first great pitfall from which such a radical standing by"},{"pageNumber":1234,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1165 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 45]Page 1165experience will save us is an artificial conception of the relations between knower and known. Throughout the historyof philosophy the subject and its object have been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities; and thereupon thepresence of the latter to the former, or the 'apprehension' by the former of the latter, has assumed a paradoxicalcharacter which all sorts of theories had to be invented to overcome. Representative theories simply shoved thesubject-object gap a step farther, getting it now between the object and the representation. Common-sense theoriesleft the gap untouched, declaring our mind able to clear it by a self-transcending leap. Transcendentalist theories left itimpassible in the finite realm, and brought an Absolute in to perform the bridging act. All the while, in the verybosom of the finite experience, every conjunction required to make the relation intelligible is given in full. Either theknower and the known are:(1) the self-same piece of experience taken twice over in different contexts; or they are(2) two pieces of actual experience belonging to the same subject, with definite tracts of conjunctive transitionalexperience between them; or(3) the known is a possible experience either of that subject or another, to which the said conjunctive transitions wouldlead, if sufficiently prolonged.To discuss all the types, the ways in which one experience may function as the knower of another, would beincompatible with the limits of this essay.1 I have just treated of type 1, the kind of knowledge called perception, inan article in this JOURNAL for September 1, 1904. This is the type of case in which the mind enjoys direct 'acquaintance'with a present object. In the other types the mind has 'knowledge-about' an object not immediately there. Of type 2,the simplest sort of1For brevity's sake I altogether omit mention of the type constituted by knowledge of the truth of general propositions. This type hasbeen thoroughly and, so far as I can see, satisfactorily, elucidated in Dewey's 'Studies in Logical Theory' (Chicago, 1904). Suchpropositions are reducible to the S-is-P form; and the 'terminus' that verifies and fulfills is the S = P as they feel in combination. Ofcourse percepts may be involved in the mediating experiences, or in the 'satisfactoriness' of the P in its new position."},{"pageNumber":1235,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1166 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 46]Page 1166conceptual knowledge, I have given some account in two articles, published respectively in Mind, Vol. X., p. 27,1885, and i the Psychological Review, Vol. II., p. 105, 1895.1 Type 3 can always formally and hypothetically bereduced to type 2, so that a brief description of that type will put the present reader sufficiently at my point of view,and make him see what the actual experience-value and meaning of the mysterious cognitive relation may be.Suppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge, at ten minutes' walk from 'Memorial Hall,' and to bethinking truly of the latter object. My mind may have before it only the name,or it may have a clear image, or it mayhave a very dim image of the hall, but such intrinsic differences in the image make no difference its cognitivefunction. Certain extrinsic phenomena, special experiences of conjunction, are what impart to the image, be it what itmay, its knowing office.For instance, if you ask me what hall I mean by my image, and I can tell you nothing, or if I fail to point or lead youtowards the Harvard Delta, or of, being led by you, I am uncertain whether the Hall I see be what I had in mind ornot, you would rightly deny that I had 'meant' that particular hall; at all, even though my mental image might to somedegree have resembled it. The resemblance would count in that case as coincidental merely, for all sorts of things of akind resemble one another in this world without being held for that reason to take cognizance of one another.On the other hand, if I can lead you to the hall, and tell you of its history and preset uses; if in its presence I now feelmy idea, however bad it may have been, to be continued; if the associates of the image and of the felt hall runparallel, so that each term of the one context corresponds serially, as I walk, with an answering term of the others;why then my soul was prophetic, and my idea must be, and by common consent would be, called cognizant of reality.The percept1These articles and their doctrine, unnoticed apparently by any one else, have lately gained favorable comment from Professor Strong inthis JOURNAL, for May 12, 1904. Dr. Dickinson S. Miller has independently thought out the same results, which Strong accordingly dubsthe James-Miller theory of cognition."},{"pageNumber":1236,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1167 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 46]Page 1167was what meant, for into it my idea has passed by conjunctive experience of sameness and fulfilled intention..Nowhere is there jar, but every later moment matches and corroborates an earlier.In this matching and corroborating, taken in no transcendental sense, but denoting definitely felt transitions, lies allthat the knowing of a percept by an idea can possibly contain or signify. Wherever such transitions are felt, the firstexperience knows the last one. Where they do not, or where even as possibles, they can not intervene, there can be nopretense of knowing. In this latter case the extremes will be connected, if connected at all, by inferior relations—barelikeness or succession, or by 'withness' alone. Knowledge thus lives inside the tissue of experience. It is made; andmade by relations that unroll themselves in time. Whenever certain intermediaries are given, such that, as they developtowards their terminus, there is experience from point to point of one direction followed, and finally of one processfulfilled, the result is that their starting point thereby becomes a knower and their terminus an object meant or known.That is all that knowing (in the simple case considered) can be known-as, that is the whole of its nature, put intoexperiential terms. Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences we may freely say that we had the terminalobject 'in mind' from the outset, even although at the outset nothing was there in us but a flat piece of substantiveexperience like any other, with no self-transcendency about it, and no mystery save the mystery of coming intoexistence and of being followed by other pieces of substantive experience, with conjunctively transitional experiencesbetween. That is what we mean here by being 'in mind.' Of any deeper more real way of being in mind we have nopositive conception, and we have no right to discredit our actual experience by talking of such a thing at all.I know that many a reader will rebel at this. ''Mere intermediaries,\" he will say, \"even though they be feelings ofcontinuously growing fulfilment, only separate the knower from the known, whereas what we have in knowledge is akind of immediate touch of the one by the other, an 'apprehension' in the etymological sense of the word, a leaping ofthe chasm"},{"pageNumber":1237,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1168 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 47]Page 1168as by lightning, an act by which union is smitten into living being, over the head of the distinctness of its terms. Allthese dead intermediaries of yours are out of each other, and outside of their termini still.\"But do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping his bone and snapping at its image in the water?If we knew any more real kind of union aliunde, we might be entitled to brand all our empirical unions as a sham. Butunions by continuous transition are the only ones we know of, whether in this matter of a knowledge-about thatterminates in an acquaintance, whether in personal identity, in logical predication through the copula 'is,' or elsewhere.If anywhere there were more absolute unions realized, they could only reveal themselves to us by just suchconjunctive results. These are what the unions are worth, these are all that we can ever practically mean by union, bycontinuity. Is it not time to repeat what Lotze said of substances, that to act like one is to be one? Should we not sayhere that to be experienced as continuous is to be really continuous, in a world where experience and reality come tothe same thing? In a picture gallery a painted hook will serve to hang a painted chain by, a painted cable will hold apainted ship. In a world where both the terms and their distinctions are affairs of experience, the conjunctions whichwe experience must be at least as real as anything else. They will be 'absolutely' real conjunctions, if we have notransphenomenal Absolute ready, to derealize the whole experienced word by, at a stroke. If, on the other hand, wehad such an Absolute, not one of our opponents' theories of knowledge could remain standing any better than ourscould; for the distinctions as well as the conjunctions of experience would impartially fall its prey. The whole questionof how 'one' thing can know 'another' would cease to be a real one at all in a world where otherness itself was anillusion.1So much for the essentials of the cognitive relation, where the knowledge is conceptual in type, or forms knowledge1Mr. Bradley, not professing to know his absolute aliunde, nevertheless derealizes Experience by alleging it to be everywhere infectedwith self-contradiction. His arguments seem almost purely verbal, but this is no place for arguing that point out."},{"pageNumber":1238,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1169 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 48]Page 1169'about' an object. It consists in intermediary experience (possible, if not actual) of continuously developing progress,and, finally, of fulfilment, when the sensible percept, which is the object, is reached. The object here not only verifiesthe idea, proves its proves its function of knowing that object to be true, but the object's existence as the terminus ofthe chain of intermediaries creates the function. Whatever terminates that chain was, because it now is, what the idea'had in mind.'The towering importance of this kind of knowing for human life lies in the fact that an experience that knows anothercan figure as its representative, not in any quasi-miraculous 'epistemological' sense, but in the definite practical senseof being its substitute in various operations, yet leading to the same result. By experimenting on our conceptualexperiences, or ideas of reality, we may save ourselves the trouble of experimenting on the real experience which theyseverally mean. The ideas from related systems, corresponding point for point to the systems which the realities form;and by letting an ideal term call up its associates systematically, we may be led to a terminus which the correspondingreal term would have led to in case we had operated on the real world. This brings us to the general question ofsubstitution, and some remarks on that subject seem to be the next thing in order.IV. SubstitutionIn Taine's brilliant book an 'Intelligence,' substitution was for the first time named as a cardinal logical function,though of course the facts had always been familiar enough. What now, exactly, in an absolute system of experiences,does the 'substitution' of one of them for another mean?According to radical empiricism, experience as a whole wears the form of a process in time, whereby innumerableparticular terms lapse and are superseded by others that follow upon them by transitions which, whether disjunctive orconjunctive in content, are themselves experiences, and must in general be accounted at least as real as the termswhich they relate. What the nature of the event called 'superseding' signifies, depends altogether on the kind oftransition that obtains. Some experiences simply abolish their predecessors without continuing them in any way.Others follow them"},{"pageNumber":1239,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1170 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 49]Page 1170more livingly, are felt to increase or to enlarge their meaning, to carry out their purpose, or to bring us nearer to theirgoal. They 'represent' them, and may fulfil their function better than they fulfilled it themselves. But to 'fulfil afunction' in a world of pure experience can be conceived and defined in only one possible way. In such a worldtransitions and arrivals (or terminations) are the only events that happen, though they happen by so many sorts of path.The only function that one experience can perform is to lead into another experience; and the only fulfilment we canspeak of is the reaching of a certain kind of end. When one experience leads to (or can lead to) the same end asanother, they agree in function. But the whole system of experiences as they are immediately given presents itself as aquasi-chaos through which one can pass out of an initial term in many directions and yet end in the same terminus,moving from next to next by a great many alternative paths.Either one of these paths might be a functional substitute for another, and to follow one rather than another might onoccasion be an advantageous thing to do. As a matter of fact, and in general way, the paths that run throughconceptual experiences, that is, through 'thoughts' or 'ideas' that 'know' the things in which they terminate, are highlyadvantageous paths to follow. Not only do they yield inconceivably rapid transitions; but, owing to the 'universal'Character1 which they frequently possess, and to their capacity for association with one another in great systems, theyoutstrip the tardy consecutions of the things themselves, and sweep us on towards our ultimate termini in a far morelabor-saving way than the following of trains of sensible perception ever could. Wonderful are the new cuts and theshort-circuits which the thought-paths make. Most thought-paths, it is true, are substitutes for nothing actual; they endoutside of the real world altogether, in wayward fancies, utopias, fictions or mistakes. But where they do reenterreality and terminate therein, we substitute them always; and with these substitutes we pass the greater number of ourhours.This is why I called our experiences, taken all together, a1Of which all that need be said in this essay is that it also can be conceived as functional, and defined in terms of transitions, or of thepossibility of such."},{"pageNumber":1240,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1171 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 50]Page 1171quasi-chaos. There is vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiences than we commonly suppose. Thenucleus of every man's experience, the sense of his own body, is, it is true, an absolutely continuous perception; andequally continuous in his perception (though it may be very inattentive) of a material environment of that body,changing by gradual transition when the body moves. But the rest of the physical world is at all times absent fromeach of us, a conceptual object merely, into the perceptual realities of which our life inserts itself at points discreteand relatively rare. Round the nucleus, partly continuous and partly discrete, of what we call the physical world ofactual perception, innumerable hosts of thinkers, pursuing their several lines of physically true cogitation trace pathsthat intersent one another only at discontinuous perceptual points, and the rest of the time are quite incongruent; andaround the whole of the nucleus of relative 'reality,' as around the Dyak's head of my late metaphor, there floats thevast nimbus of experiences that are wholly subjective, that are non-substitutional, that find not even an eventualending for themselves in the perceptual world—the mere day-dreams and joys and sufferings and wishes of theindividual minds. These exist with one another, indeed, and with the objective nucleus, but out of them it is probablethat to all eternity no inter-related system of any kind will ever be made.This notion of the purely substitutional or conceptual physical world brings us to the most critical of all the steps inthe development of a philosophy of pure experience. The paradox of self-transcendency in knowledge comes backupon us here, but I think that our notions of pure experience and of substitution, and our radically empirical view ofconjunctive transitions, are Denkmittel that will carry us safely through the pass.V. What Objective Reference IsWhosoever feels his experience as something substitutional, even while he has it, may be said to have an experiencethat reaches beyond itself. From inside of its own entity it postulates reality existing elsewhere. For thetranscendentalist, who holds knowing to consist in a salto mortale across an 'epistemological chasm,' such an ideapresents no difficulty, but it seems at first sight as if it might be inconsistent with an"},{"pageNumber":1241,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1172 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 52]Page 1172empiricism like our own. Have we not explained conceptual knowledge to be wholly constituted by things that falloutside of the knowing experience itself—by intermediary experiences and by a terminus that fulfills? Can theknowledge be there before these elements that constitute its being have come? And, if knowledge be not there, howcan objective reference occur?The key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing as verified and completed, and the same knowing asin transit and on its way. To recur to the Memorial Hall example of my former article, it is only when our idea of theHall has actually terminated in the percept that we know 'for certain' that from the beginning it was truly cognitive ofthat. Until established by the end of the process, its quality of knowing that, or indeed of knowing anything, could stillbe doubted; and yet the knowing really was there, as the result now shows. We were virtual knowers of the Hall longbefore we were nailed down and certified to have been its actual knowers by the percept's retroactive validatingpower.Now the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond this virtual stage. It never is completed ornailed down. I speak not merely of our ideas of imperceptibles like ether-waves or dissociated 'ions,' or of 'ejects' likethe contents of our neighbors' minds; I speak also of ideas which we might verify if we would take the trouble, butwhich we hold for true although unterminated perceptually, because nothing says 'no' to us, and there is nocontradicting truth in sight. To continue thinking unchallenged is, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, our practicalsubstitute for knowing in the completed sense. As each experience runs by cognitive transition into the next one, andwe nowhere feel a collision with what we elsewhere count as fact, we commit ourselves to the current as if the portwere sure. We live, as it were, upon the front edge of an advancing wave-crest, and our sense of a determinatedirection in falling forward is all we cover of the future of our path. It is as if a differential quotient should beconscious and treat itself as an adequate substitute for a traced-out curve. Our experience, inter alia, is of variationsof rate and of direction, and lives in these transitions more than in the journey's end. The truncated experiences aresufficient"},{"pageNumber":1242,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1173 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 53]Page 1173to act upon—what more could we have done at those moments even if later verification were complete?This is what, as a radical empiricist, I say to the charge that the objective reference which is so flagrant a character ofour experiences involves a chasm and a mortal leap. A positively conjunctive transition involves neither chasm norleap. Being the very original of what we mean by continuity, it makes a continuum wherever it appears. I know fullwell that such brief words as these will leave the hardened transcendentalist unshaken. Conjunctive experiencesseparate their terms, he will still say: they are third things interposed, that have themselves to be conjoined by newlinks, and to invoke them makes our trouble infinitely worse. To 'feel' our motion forward is impossible. Motionimplies terminus; and how can terminus be felt before we have arrived? The barest start and sally forwards, the baresttendency to leave the instant, involves the chasm and the leap. Conjunctive transitions are the most superficial ofappearances, illusions of our sensibility which philosophical reflection pulverizes at a touch. Conception is our onlytrustworthy instrument, conception and the Absolute working hand in hand. Conception disintegrates experienceutterly, but its disjunctions are easily overcome again when the Absolute takes up the task.Such transcendentalists I must leave, provisionally at least, in full possession of their creed. I have no space forpolemics in this article, so I shall simply formulate the empiricist doctrine as my hypothesis, leaving it to work or notworks as it may.Objective reference, I say then, is a mere incident of the fact that so much of our experience comes as an insufficientand is of process and transition. Our fields of experience have no more definite boundaries than have our fields ofview. Both are fringed forever by a more that continuously develops, and that continuously supersedes them as lifeproceeds. The relations, generally speaking, are as real here as the terms are, and the only complaint of thetranscendentalist's with which I could at all sympathize would be his charge that, by first making knowledge to consistin external relations as I have done, and by then confessing that nine-tenths of the time these are not actually there, sothat our knowledge for"},{"pageNumber":1243,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1174 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 53]Page 1174the most part keeps only virtual, I have knocked the solid bottom out of the whole business, and palmed off a meresubstitute of knowledge for the genuine thing. Only the admission that our ideas are self-transcendent already, such acritic might say, in advance of the experiences that are to terminate them, can bring solidity back to knowledge in aworld like this, in which transitions and terminations are only by exception carried out.This seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic method. When a dispute arises, that method consists inauguring what practical consequences would be different if one side rather than the other were true. If no differencecan be thought of, the dispute is a quarrel over words.What then would the salto mortale, the immediate self-transcendency affirmed as something existing independently ofexperiential mediation or termination, be known as, what would it practically result in, were it true?It could only result in our orientation, in the turning of our expectations and practical tendencies into the right path;and the right path here, so long as we and the object are not yet face to face (or can never get face to face, as in thecase of ejects), would be the path that led us into the object's nearest neighborhood. Where direct acquaintance islacking, 'knowledge about' is the next best thing, and such knowledge an acquaintance with what actually lies aboutthe object, and is most closely related to it, puts within our grasp. Ether-waves and your anger, for example, are thingsin which my thoughts will never perceptually terminate, but my concepts of them lead me to their very brink, to thechromatic fringes and to the hurtful words and deeds which are their really next effects.Even if our ideas did in themselves carry the postulated self-transcendency, it would still remain true that their puttingus into possession of such really next effects would be the sole cash-value of the self-transcendency for us. And thiscash value, it is needless to say, is verbatim et literatim what our empiricist account pays in. On pragmatist principlestherefore, a dispute over self-transcendency here would be a pure logomachy. Call our concepts of ejective thingsself-transcendent or the reverse, it makes no difference, so long as we don't differ about the nature of that exaltedvirtue's fruits."},{"pageNumber":1244,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1175 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 54]Page 1175Fruits for us, humanistic fruits, of course. If an Absolute were proved to exist for other reasons, it might well appearthat his knowledge is terminated in innumerable cases where ours is still incomplete. That, however, would be a factindifferent to our knowledge. The latter would grow neither worse nor better, whether we acknowledged such anAbsolute or left him out.So the notion of a knowledge still in transitu and on its way joins hands here with notion of a 'pure experience' whichI tried to explain in my recent article entitled 'Does Consciousness Exist?' The instant field of the present is alwaysexperience in its 'pure' state, plain unqualified actuality, a simple that, as yet undifferentiated into thing and thought,and only virtually classifiable as objective fact or as some one's opinion about fact. This is as true when the field isconceptual as when it is perceptual. 'Memorial Hall' is 'there' in my idea as much as when I stand before it. I proceedto act on its account in either case. Only in the later experience that supersedes the present one is this naif immediacyretrospectively split into two parts, a 'consciousness' and its 'content,' and the content corrected or confirmed. Whilestill pure, or present, any experience—mine, for example, of what I write about in these very lines—passes for 'truth.'The morrow may reduce it to 'opinion.' The transcendentalist in all his particular knowledges is as liable to thisreduction as I am: his Absolute does not save him. Why, then, need he quarrel with an account of knowing thatmerely leaves it liable to this inevitable condition? Why insist on its being a static relation out of time when itpractically seems so much a function of our active life? For a thing to be valid, says Lotze, is the same as to makeitself valid. When the whole universe seems only to be making itself valid and to be still incomplete (else why itsceaseless changing?) why, of all things, should knowing be exempt? Why should it not be making itself valid likeeverything else? That some parts of it may be already valid or verified beyond dispute, the empirical philosopher, ofcourse, like any one else, may always hope.VI. The Conterminousness Of Different MindsWith transition and prospect thus enthroned in pure ex-"},{"pageNumber":1245,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1176 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 54]Page 1176perience, it is impossible to subscribe to the idealism of the English school. Radical empiricism has, in fact, moreaffinities with natural realism than with the views of Berkeley or of Mill, and this can be easily shown.For the Berkeleyan school, ideas (the verbal equivalent of what I term experiences) are discontinuous. The content ofeach is wholly immanent, and there are no transitions with which they are consubstantial and through which theirbeings may unite. Your Memorial Hall and mine, even when both are percepts, are wholly out of connection witheach other. Our lives are a congeries of solipsisms, out of which in strict logic only a God could compose a universeeven of discourse. No dynamic currents run between my objects and your objects. Never can our minds meet in thesame.The incredibility of such a philosophy is flagrant. It is 'cold, strained, and unnatural' in a supreme degree; and it maybe doubted whether even Berkeley himself, who took it so religiously, really believed, when walking through thestreets of London, that his spirit and the spirits of his fellow wayfarers had absolutely different towns in view.To me the decisive reason in favor of our minds meeting in some common objects at least is that, unless I make thatsupposition, I have no motive for assuming that your mind exists at all. Why do I postulate your mind? Because I seeyour body acting in a certain way. Its gestures, facial movements, words and conduct generally, are 'experience' so Ideem it actuated as my own is, by an inner life like mine. This argument from analogy is my reason, whether aninstinctive belief runs before it or not. But what is 'your body' here but a percept in my field? It is only as animatingthat object, my object, that I have any occasion to think of you at all. If the body that you actuate be not the very bodythat I see there, but some duplicate body of your own with which that has nothing to do, we belong to differentuniverses, you and I, and for me to speak of you is folly. Myriads of such universes even now may coexist, irrelevantto one another; my concern is solely with the universe with which my own life is connected.In that perceptual part of my universe which I call your body, your mind and my mind meet and may be called con-"},{"pageNumber":1246,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1177 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 55]Page 1177terminous. Your mind actuates that body and mine sees it; my thoughts pass into it as into their harmonious cognitivefulfillment; your emotions and volitions pass into it as causes into their effects.But that percept hangs together with all our other physical percepts. They are of one stuff with it; and if it be ourcommon possession, they must be so likewise. For instance, your hand lays hold of one end of a rope and my handlays hold of the other end. We pull against each other. Can our two hands be mutual objects in this experience, andthe rope not be mutual also? What is true of the rope is true of any other percept. Your objects are over and overagain the same as mine. If I ask you where some objects of yours is, our old Memorial Hall, for example, you point tomy Memorial Hall with your hand which I see. If you alter an object in your world, put out a candle, for example,when I am present, my candle ipso facto goes out. It is only as altering my objects that I guess you to exist. If yourobjects do no coalesce with my objects, if they be no identically where mine are, they must be proved to be positivelysomewhere else. But no other location can be assigned for them, so their place must be what it seems to be, the same.1Practically, then our minds meet in a world of objects which they share in common, which would still be there, if oneor several of the minds were destroyed. I can see no formal objection to this supposition's being literally true. On theprinciples which I am defending, a 'mind' or 'personal consciousness' is the name for the series of experiences runtogether by certain definite transitions, and an objective reality is a series of similar experiences knit by differenttransitions. If one and the same experience can figure twice, once in a mental and once in a physical context (as Ihave tried, in my article on 'Consciousness,' to show that it can), one does not see why it might not figure thrice, orfour times, or any number of times, by running into as many different mental contexts, just as the same point, lying attheir intersection, can be continued into many different lines. Abolishing any number of contexts would not destroythe experience itself or its other1The notion that our objects are inside of our respective heads is not seriously defensible, so I pass it by."},{"pageNumber":1247,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1178 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 55]Page 1178contexts, any more than abolishing some of the point's linear continuations would destroy the others, or destroy thepoint itself.I well know the subtle dialectic which insists that a term taken in another relation must needs be an intrinsicallydifferent term. The crux is always the old Greek one, that the same man can't be tall in relation to one neighbor, andshort in relation to another, for that would make him tall and short at once. It this essay I can not stop to refuse thisdialectic, so I pass on, leaving my flank for the time exposed. But if my reader will only allow that the same 'now'both ends his past and begins his future; or that, when he buys an acre of land from his neighbor, it is the same acrethat successively figures in the two estates; or that when I pay him a dollar, the same dollar goes into his pocket thatcame out of mine; he will also in consistency have to allow that the same object may conceivably play a part in, asbeing related to the rest of, any number of otherwise entirely different minds. This is enough for my present point: thecommon-sense notion of minds sharing the same object offers no special logical or epistemological difficulties of itsown; it stands or falls with the general possibility of things being in conjunctive relation with other things at all.In principle, then, let natural realism pass for possible. Your mind and mine may terminate in the same percept, notmerely against it, as if it were a third external thing, but by inserting themselves into it and coalescing with it, for suchis the sort of conjunctive union that appears to be experienced when a perception terminus 'fulfills.' Even so, twohawsers may embrace the same pile, and yet neither one of them touch any other part, except that pile, of what theother hawser is attached to.It is therefore not a formal question, but a question of empirical fact solely, whether, when you and I are said to knowthe 'same' Memorial Hall, our minds do terminate at or in a numerically identical percept. Obviously, as a plain matterof fact, they do not. Apart from color-blindness and such possibilities, we see the Hall in different perspectives. Youmay be on one side of it and I on another. The percept of each of us, as he sees the surface of the Hall, is moreoveronly his pro-"},{"pageNumber":1248,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1179 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 56]Page 1179visional terminus. The next thing beyond my percept is not your mind, but more percepts of my own into which myfirst percept develops, the interior of the Hall, for instance, or the inner structure of its bricks and mortar. If our mindswere in a literal sense conterminous, neither could get beyond the percept which they had in common, it would be anultimate barrier between them—unless indeed they became 'co-conscious' over a still larger part of their content,which (thought-transference apart) is not supposed to be the actual case. In point of fact the ultimate common barriercan always be pushed, by both minds, farther than any actual percept, until at last it resolves itself into the merenotion of imperceptibles like molecules or ether, so that, where we do not terminate in percepts, our knowledge is onlyspeciously completed, being, in theoretic strictness, only a virtual knowledge of those remoter objects whichconception carries out.Is natural realism, permissible in logic, refuted then by empirical fact? Do our minds have no object in common afterall?Yes, they certainly have Space in common. On pragmatic principles we are obliged to predicate sameness whereverwe can predicate no assignable point of difference. If two named things have every equality and functionindiscernible, and are at the same time in the same place, they must be written down as numerically one thing undertwo different names. But there is not test discoverable, so far as I know, by which it can be shown that the placeoccupied by your percept of Memorial Hall differs from the place occupied by mine. The percepts themselves may beshown to differ; but if each of us be asked to point out where his percept is, we point to an identical spot. All therelations, whether geometrical or causal, of the Hall originate or terminate in that spot wherein our hands meet, andwhere each of us begins to work if he wishes to make the Hall change before the other's eyes. Just so it is with ourbodies. That body of yours which you actuate and feel from within must be in the same spot as the body of yourswhich I see or touch from without.'There' for me means where I place my finger. If you do not feel my finger'scontract to be 'there' in my sense, when I place it on your body, where then do you feel it? Your inner actuations"},{"pageNumber":1249,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1180 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 56]Page 1180of your body also meet my finger there: it is there that you resist its push, or shrink back, or sweep the finger asidewith your hand. Whatever farther knowledge either of us may acquire of the real constitution of the body which wethus feel, you from within and I from without, it is in that same place that the newly conceived or perceivedconstituents have to be located, and it is through that space that your and my mental intercourse with each other hasalways to be carried on, by the mediation of impressions which I convey thither, and of the reactions thence whichthose impressions may provoke from you.In general terms, then, whatever differing contents our minds may eventually fill a place with, the place itself is anumerically identical content of the two minds, a piece of common property in which, through which, and over whichthey join. The receptacle of certain of our experiences being thus common, the experiences themselves might someday become common also. If that day ever did come, our thoughts would terminate in a complete empirical identity,they would be and end, so far as those experiences went, to our discussions about truth. No points of differenceappearing, they would have to count as the same.VII Conclusion.With this we have the outline of a philosophy of pure experience before us. At the outset of my essay, I called it amosaic philosophy. In actual mosaics the pieces are held together by their bedding, for which bedding the Substances,transcendental Egos, or Absolutes of other philosophies may be taken to stand. In radical empiricism there is nobedding; it is as if the pieces clung together by their edges, the transitions experienced between them forming theircement. Of course such a metaphor is misleading, for in actual experience the more substantive and the moretransitive parts run into each other continuously, there is in general no separateness needing to be overcome by anexternal cement; and whatever separateness is actually experienced is not overcome, it stays and counts asseparateness to the end. But the metaphor serves to symbolize the fact that Experience itself, taken at large, can growby its edges. That one moment of it prolif-"},{"pageNumber":1250,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1181 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 57]Page 1181erates into the next by transitions which, whether conjunctive or disjunctive, continue the experiential tissue, can not, Icontend, be denied. Life is in the transitions as much as in the terms connected; often, indeed, it seems to be theremore emphatically, as it our spurts and sallies forward were the real firing-line of the battle, were like the thin line offlame advancing across the dry autumnal field which the farmer proceeds to burn. In this line we live prospectively aswell as retrospectively. It is 'of' the past, inasmuch as it comes expressly as the past's continuation; it is 'of' the futurein so far as the future, when it comes, will have continued it.These relations of continuous transition experienced are what make our experiences cognitive. In the simplest andcompletest cases the experiences are cognitive of one another. When one of them terminates a previous series of themwith a sense of fulfillment, it, we say, is what those other experiences 'had in view.' The knowledge, in such a case, inverified, the truth is 'salted down.' Mainly, however, we live on speculative investments, or on our prospects only. Butliving on things in in posse is as good as living in the actual, so long as our credit remains good. It is evident that forthe most part it is good, and that the universe seldom protests our drafts.In this sense we at every moment can continue to believe in an existing beyond. It is only in special cases that ourconfident rush forward gets rebuked. The beyond must of course always in our philosophy be itself of an experientialnature. If not a future experience of our own or a present one of our neighbor, it must be a thing in itself in Dr.Prince's and Professor Strong's sense of the term—that is, it must be an experience for itself whose relation to otherthings we translate into the action of molecules, ether-waves, or whatever else the physical symbols may be.1 Thisopens the chapter of the relations of radical empiricism to panpsychism, into which I can not enter now.The beyond can in any case exist simultaneously—for it1Our minds and these ejective realities would still have space (or pseudo space, as I believe Professor Strong calls the medium ofinteraction between 'things-in-themselves') in common. These would exist where, and begin to act where, we locate the molecules etc.,and where we perceive the sensible phenomena explained thereby."},{"pageNumber":1251,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1182 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 57]Page 1182can be experienced to have existed simultaneously—with the experience that practically postulates it by looking in itsdirection, or by turning or changing in the direction of which it is the goal. Pending that actuality of union, in thevirtuality of which the 'truth,' even now, of the postulation consists, the beyond and its knower are entities split offfrom each other. The world is in so far forth a pluralism of which the unity is not fully experienced as yet. But, as fastas verification comes, trains of experience, once separate, run into one another; and that is why I said, earlier in myarticle, that the unity of the world is on the whole undergoing increase. The universe continually grows in quantity bynew experiences that graft themselves upon the older mass; but these very new experiences often help the mass to amore consolidated form.These are the main features of a philosophy of pure experience. It has innumerable other aspects and arousesinnumerable questions, but the points I have touched on seem enough to make an entering wedge. In my own mindsuch a philosophy harmonizes best with a radical pluralism, with novelty and indeterminism, moralism and theism,and with the 'humanism' lately sprung upon us by the Oxford and the Chicago schools.1 I can not, however, be surethat all these doctrines are its necessary and indispensable allies. It presents so many points of difference, both fromthe commons sense and from the idealism that have made our philosophic language, that it is almost as difficult tostate it as it is to think it out clearly, and if it is ever to grow into a respectable system, it will have to be built up bythe contributions of many cooperating minds. It seems to me, as I said at the outset of this essay, that many minds are,in point of fact, now turning in a direction that points towards radical empiricism. If they are carried farther by mywords, and if then they add their stronger voices to my feebler one, the publication of this essay will have been worthwhile.1I have said something of this latter alliance in an article entitled 'Humanism and Truth,' in Mind, October, 1904.The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods,September 29 and October 13, 1904"},{"pageNumber":1252,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1183 hl[01 03 2011 21 21 58]Page 1183Answers to a QuestionnaireIt is being realized as never before that religion, as one of the most important things in the life both of the communityand of the individual, deserves close and extended study.

These from one peculiar 'context' for it; while, taken in another context of experiences,we class it as a fact in the physical world. This 'pen,' for example, is, in the first instance, a bald that a datum, fact, phenomenon, content, or whatever other neutral orambiguous name you may prefer to apply. I called it in that article a 'pure experience.' To get classed either as a physical pen or as some one's percept of a pen, it mustassume a function, and that can only happen in a more complicated world. So far as in that world it is a stable feature, holds ink, marks paper and obeys the guidance of ahand, it is a physical pen. That is what we mean by being 'physical,' in a pen. So far as it is instable, on the contrary, coming and going with the movements of my eyes,altering with what I call my fancy, continuous with subsequent experiences of its 'having been' (in the past tense), it is the percept of a pen in my mind. Thosepeculiarities are what we mean by being 'conscious,' in a pen.In section VI, of another article2 I tried to show that the some that, the same numerically identical pen of pureexperience, can enter simultaneously into many conscious contexts, or, in other words, be an object for many difficultminds. I admitted that I had not space to treat of certain possible objections in that article; but in a subsequent article3I took some of the objections up. At the end of that article I said that still more formidable-sounding objectionsremained; so,1Vol. I., p. 477, September 1, 1904.2'A World of Pure Experience,' ibid., Vol. I., p. 564, October 13, 1904.3'The Thing and its Relations,' in the present volume of this JOURNAL, p. 29.,"},{"pageNumber":1256,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1187 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 00]Page 1187to leave my pure-experience theory in as strong a state as possible, I propose to consider those objections now.IThe objections I previously tried to disposed of were purely logical or dialectical. No one identical term, whetherphysical or psychical, it had been said, could be the subject of two relations at once. This thesis I sought to proveunfounded. The objections that now confront us arise from the nature supposed to inhere in psychic facts specifically.Whatever may be the case with physical objects, a fact of consciousness, it is alleged (and indeed very plausibly), cannot, without self-contradiction, be treated as a portion of two different minds, and for the following reasons.In the physical world we make with impunity the assumption that one and the same material object can figure in anindefinitely large number of different processes at once. When, for instance, a sheet of rubber is pulled at its fourcorners, a unit or rubber in the middle of the sheet is affected by all four of the pulls. It transmits them each, as if itpulled in four different ways at once itself. So, an air-particle or an ether-particle 'compounds' the different directionsof movement imprinted on it without obliterating their several individualities. It delivers them distinct, on the contrary,at as many several 'receivers' (ear, eye or what not) as may be 'tuned' to that effect. The apparent paradox of adistinctness like this surviving in the midst of compounding is a thing which, I fancy, the analyses made by physicistshave by this time sufficiently cleared up.But, if, no the strength of these analogies, one should ask: \"Why, if two or more lines can run through one and thesame geometrical point, or if two or more distinct process of activity can run through one and the same physical thingso that it simultaneously plays a rôle in each and every process, might not two or more streams of personalconsciousness include one and the same unit of experience so that it would simultaneously be a part of the experienceof all the different minds?\" one would be checked by thinking of a certain peculiarity by which phenomena ofconsciousness differ from physical things."},{"pageNumber":1257,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1188 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 00]Page 1188While physical things, namely, are supposed to be permanent and to have their 'states,' a fact of consciousness existsbut once and is a state. Its esse is sentiri; it is only to is felt; and it is unambiguously and unequivocally exactly whatis felt. The hypothesis under consideration would, however, oblige it to be felt equivocally, felt now as part of mymind and again at the same time not as a part of my mind, but of yours (for my mind is not yours), and this wouldseem impossible without doubling it into two distinct things, or, in other words, without reverting to the ordinarydualistic philosophy of insulated minds each knowing its object representatively as a third thing,—and that would beto give up the pure-experience scheme altogether.Can we see, then, any way in which a unit of pure experience might enter into and figure in two diverse streams ofconsciousness without turning itself into the two units which, on our hypothesis, it must not be?IIThere is a way; and the first step towards it is to see more precisely how the unit enters into either one of the streamsof consciousness alone. Just what, from being 'pure,' does its becoming 'conscious' once mean?It means, first, that new experiences have supervened; and, second, that they have borne a certain assignable relationto the unit supposed. Continue, if you please, to speak of the pure unit as 'the pen.' So far as the pen's successors dobut repeat the pen or, being different from it, are 'energetically'1 related to it, it and they will form a group of stablyexisting physical things. So far, however, as its successors differ from it in another well-determined way, the pen willfigure in their context, not as a physical, but as a mental fact. It will become a passing 'percept,' my percept of thatpen. What now is that decisive well-determined way?In the chapter on 'The Self,' in my 'Principles of Psychology,' I explained the continuous identity of each personalconsciousness as a name for the practical fact that new1For an explanation of this expression see above, Vol I., p. 489."},{"pageNumber":1258,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1189 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 00]Page 1189experiences1 come which look back on the old ones, find them 'warm,' and greet and appropriate them as 'mine.' Theseoperations mean, when analyzed empirically, several tolerably definite things, viz.:1. That the new experience has past time for its 'content,' and in that time a pen that 'was';2. That 'warmth' was also about the pen, in the sense of a group of feelings ('interest' aroused, 'attention' turned, 'eyes,'employed, etc.) that were closely connected with it and that now recur and evermore recur with unbroken vividness,though from the pen of now which may be only an image all such vividness may have gone;3. That these feelings are the nucleus of 'me';4. That whatever once was associated with them was, at least for that one moment, 'mine'—my implement ifassociated with hand-feelings, my 'percept' only, if only eye-feelings and attention-feelings were involved.The pen, realized in this retrospective way as my percept, thus figures as a fact of 'conscious' life. But it does so onlyso far as 'appropriation' has occurred; and appropriation is part of the content of a latter experience wholly additionalto the originally 'pure' pen. That pen, virtually both objective and subjective, is at its own moment actually andintrinsically neither. It has to be looked back upon and used, in order to be classed in either distinctive way. But itsuse, so called, is in the hands of the other experience, while it stands, throughout the operation, passive andunchanged.If this pass muster as an intelligible account of how an experience originally pure can enter into one consciousness,the next question is as to how it might conceivably enter into two.IIIObviously no new kind of condition would have to be supplied. All that we should have to postulate would be asecond subsequent experience, collateral and contemporary with the first subsequent one, in which a similar act ofappropriation should occur. The two acts would interfere neither with one1I call them 'passing thoughts' in the book—the passage in point goes from pages 330 to 342 of Vol. I."},{"pageNumber":1259,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1190 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 01]Page 1190another nor with the originally pure pen. It would sleep undisturbed in its own past, no matter how many suchsuccessors went through their several appropriate acts. Each would know it as 'my' percept, each would class it as a'conscious' fact.Nor need their so classing it interfere in the least with their classing it at the same time as physical pen. Since theclassing in both cases depends upon the taking of it in one group or another of associates, if the supersedingexperience were of wide enough 'span' it could think the pen in both groups simultaneously, and yet distinguish thetwo groups. It would then see the whole situation conformably to what we call 'the representative theory of cognition,'and that is what we all spontaneously do. As a man philosophizing 'popularly,' I believe that what I see myself writingwith is double—I think it in its relations to physical nature, and also in its relations to my personal life; I see that it isin my mind, but that it also is a physical pen.The paradox of the same experience figuring in two consciousness seems thus no paradox at all. To be 'conscious'means not simply to be, but to be reported, known, to have awareness of one's being added to that being; and this isjust what happens when the appropriative experience supervenes. The pen-experience in its original immediacy is notaware of itself, it simply is, and the second experience is required for what we call awareness of it to occur.1 Thedifficulty of understanding what happens here is, therefore, not a logical difficulty: there is no contradiction involved.It is an ontological difficulty rather. Experiences come on an enormous scale, and if we take them all together, theycome in a chaos of incommensurable relations that we can not straighten out. We have to abstract different groups ofthem, and handle these separately if we are to talk of them at all. But how the experiences ever get themselves made,or why their characters and relations1Shadworth Hodgson has laid great stress on the fact that the minimum of consciousness demands two subfeelings, of which the secondretrospects the first. (Cf. the section 'Analysis of Minima' in his 'Philosophy of Reflection,' I., 248; also the chapter entitled 'The Momentof Experience' in his 'Metaphysic of Experience,' Vol. I.) 'We live forward, we understand backward' is a phrase of Kierkegaard's whichHöffding quotes."},{"pageNumber":1260,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1191 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 01]Page 1191are just such as appear, we can not begin to understand. Granting, however, that, by hook or crook, they can getthemselves made, and can appear in the successions that I have so schematically described, then we have no confessthat even although (as I began by quoting from the adversary) 'a feeling only is as it is felt,' there is still nothingabsurd in the notion of its being felt in two different ways at once, as yours, namely, and as mine. It is, indeed, 'mine'only as it is felt as mine, and 'yours' only as it is felt as yours. But it is felt as neither by itself, but only when 'owned'by our two several remembering experiences, just as one undivided estate is owned by several heirs.IVOne word, now, before I close, about the corollaries of the views set forth. Since the acquisition of conscious qualityon the part of an experience depends upon a context coming to it, it follows that the sum total of all experiences,having no context, can not strictly be called conscious at all. It is a that, an Absolute, a 'pure' experience on anenormous scale, undifferentiated and undifferentiable into thought and thing. This the post-Kantian idealists havealways practically acknowledged by calling their doctrine an Identitätsphilosophie. The question of the Beseelung ofthe All things ought not, then, even to be asked. No more ought the question of its truth to be asked, for truth is arelation inside of the sum total, obtaining between thoughts and something else, and thoughts, as we have seen, canonly be contextual things. In these respects the pure experiences of our philosophy are, in themselves considered, somany little absolutes, the philosophy of pure experience being only a more comminuted Identitätsphilosophie.Meanwhile, a pure experience can be postulated with any amount whatever of span or field. If it exert theretrospective and appropriative function on any other piece of experience, the latter thereby enters into its ownconscious stream. And in this operation time intervals make no essential difference. After sleeping, my retrospectionis as perfect as it is between two successive walking moments of my time. Accordingly if, millions of years later, asimilarly retrospective experience"},{"pageNumber":1261,"pageContent":" Page 1192should anyhow come to birth, my present thought would form a genuine portion of its long-span conscious life. 'Forma portion,' I say, but not in the sense that the two things could be entitatively or substantively one—they can not, forthey are numerically discrete facts—but only in the sense that the functions of my present thought, its knowledge, itspurpose, its content and 'consciousness,' in short, being inherited, would be continued practically unchanged.Speculations like Fechner's, of an Earth-soul, of wider spans of consciousness enveloping narrower ones throughoutthe cosmos, are, therefore, philosophically quite in order, provided they distinguish the functional from the entitativepoint of view, and do not treat the minor consciousness under discussion as a kind of standing material of which thewider ones consist.The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods,March 30, 1905"},{"pageNumber":1262,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1193 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 02]Page 1193Humanism and Truth Once MoreMr. Joseph's criticism, in the last number of MIND, of my article 'Humanism and Truth' is a useful contribution to thegeneral clearing up. He has seriously tried to comprehend what the pragmatic movement may intelligibly mean; and ifhe has failed, it is the fault neither of his patience nor of his sincerity, but rather of stubborn tricks of thought whichhe could not easily get rid of. Minute polemics, in which the parties try to rebut every detail of each of the other'scharges, are a useful exercise only to the disputants. They can but breed confusion in a reader. I will therefore ignoreas much as possible the text of both our articles (mine was inadequate enough) and treat once more the generalobjective situation.As I apprehend the movement towards humanism, it is based no no particular discovery or principle that can be driveninto one precise formula which thereupon can be impaled upon a logical skewer. It is much more like one of thesesecular changes that come upon public opinion overnight, as it were, borne upon tides 'too full for sound or foam,' thatsurvive all the crudities and extravagances of their advocates, that you can pin to no one absolutely essentialstatement, nor kill by any one decisive stab.Such have been the changes from aristocracy to democracy, from classic to romantic taste, from theistic to pantheisticfeeling, from static to evolutionary ways of understanding life—changes of which we all have been spectators.Scholasticism still opposes to such changes the method of confutation by single decisive reasons, showing that thenew view involves self-contradiction, or traverses some fundamental principle. This is like stopping a river byplanting a stick in the middle of its bed. Round your obstacle flows the eater and 'gets there all the same.' In readingMr. Joseph, I am not a little reminded of those Catholic writers who refute Darwinism by telling us that higher speciescannot come from lower because minus nequit gignere plus, or that the notion of transformation is absurd, for itimplies that species tend of their own destruction, and that would violate the principle that every reality"},{"pageNumber":1263,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1194 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 03]Page 1194tends to preserve in its own shape. The point of view is too myopic, too tight and close to take in the inductiveargument. You cannot settle questions of fact by formal logic. I feel as if Mr. Joseph almost pounced on my wordssingly, without giving the sentences time to get out of my mouth.The one condition of understanding humanism is to become inductive-minded oneself, to drop rigorous definitions,and follow lines of least resistance 'on the whole'. ''In other words,\" Mr. Joseph may probably say, \"resolve yourintellect into a kind of slush.\" \"Even so,\" I make reply,—\"if you will consent to use no politer word.\" For humanism,conceiving the more 'true' as the more 'satisfactory' (Dewey's term), has to renounce sincerely rectilinear argumentsand ancient ideals of rigour and finality. It is in just this temper of renunciation, so different from that of pyrrhonisticscepticism, that the spirit of humanism essentially consists. Satisfactoriness has to be measured by a multitude ofstandards, of which some, for aught we know, may fail in any given case; and what is 'more' satisfactory than anyalternative in sight, may to the end be a sum of pluses and minuses, concerning which we can only trust that byulterior corrections and improvements a maximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day beapproached. It means a real change of heart, a break with absolutistic hopes, when one takes up this view of theconditions of belief.That humanism's critics have never imagined this attitude inwardly, is shown by their invariable tactics. They do notget into it far enough to see objectively and from without what their own opposite notion of truth is. Mr. Joseph ispossessed by some such notion; he thinks his readers to be full of it, he obeys it, works from it, but never even essaysto tell us what it is. The nearest he comes to doing so is where (on p. 37) he says it is the way \"we ought to drink,\"whether we be psychologically compelled to or not.Of course humanism agrees to this: it is only a manner of calling truth an ideal. But humanism explicates thesummarising word 'ought' into a mass of pragmatic motives from the midst of which our critics think that truth itselftakes flight. Truth is a name of double meaning. It stands now for an abstract something defined only as that to whichour thought"},{"pageNumber":1264,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1195 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 04]Page 1195ought to confirm; and again it stands for the concrete propositions within which we believe that conformity alreadyreigns—they being so many 'truths'. Humanism sees that the only conformity we ever have to deal with concretely isthat between our subjects and our predicates, using these words in a very broad sense. It sees moreover that thisconformity is 'validated' (to use Mr. Schiller's term) by an indefinite number of pragmatic tests that vary as thepredicates and subjects vary. If an S gets superseded by an SP that gives our mind a completer sum of satisfactions,we always say, humanism points out, that we have advanced to a better position in regard to truth.Now many of our judgments thus attained are retrospective. The S'es, so the judgment runs, were SP's already ere thefact was humanly recorded. Common sense, struck by this state of things, now rearranges the whole field; andtraditional philosophy follows her example. The general requirement that predicates must conform to their subject,they translate into an ontological theory. A most previous Subject of all is substituted for the lesser subjects andconceived of as an archetypal Reality; and the conformity required of predicates in detail is reinterpreted as a relationwhich our whole mind, with all its subjects and predicates together, must get into with respect to this Reality. It,meanwhile, is conceived as eternal, static, and unaffected by our thinking. Conformity to a non-human Archetype likethis is probably the notion of truth which my opponent shares with common sense and philosophic rationalism.When now Humanism, fully admitting both the naturalness and the grandeur of this hypothesis, nevertheless points toits sterility, and declines to chime in with the substitution, keeping to the concrete and still lodging truth between thesubjects and the predicates in detail, it provokes the outcry which we hear and which my critic echoes.One of the commonest parts of the outcry is that humanism is subjectivistic altogether—it is supposed to labour undera necessity of 'denying trans-perceptual reality'. It is not hard to see how this misconception of humanism may havearisen; and humanistic writers, partly from not having sufficiently guarded their expressions, and partly from nothaving"},{"pageNumber":1265,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1196 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 04]Page 1196yet \"got round\" (in the poverty of their literature) to a full discussion of the subject, are doubtless in some degree toblame. But I fail to understand how any one with a working grasp of their principles can charge them wholesale withsubjectivism. I myself have never thought of humanism as being subjectivistic farther than to this extent, that,inasmuch as it treats the thinker as being himself one portion of reality, it must also allow that some of the realitiesthat he declares for true are created by his being there. Such realities of course are either acts of his, or relationsbetween other things and him, or relations between things, which, but for him, would never have been traced.Humanists are subjectivistic, also in this, that, unlike rationalists (who think they carry a warrant for the absolute truthof what they now believe in in their present pocket), they hold all present beliefs as subject to revision in the light offuture experience. The future experience, however, may be of things outside the thinker; and that this is so thehumanist may believe as freely as any other kind of empiricist philosopher.The critics of humanism (though here I follow them but darkly) appear to object to any infusion whatever ofsubjectivism into truth. All must be archetypal; every truth must preexist to its perception. Humanism sees that anenormous quantity of truth must be written down as having pre-existed to its perception by us humans. In countlessinstances we find it most satisfactory to believe that, though we were always ignorant of the fact, it always was a factthat S was SP. But humanism separates this class of cases from those in which it is more satisfactory to believe theopposite, e.g. that S is ephemeral, or P a passing event, or SP created by the perceiving act. Our critics seem on theother hand, to wish to universalise the retrospective type of instance. Reality for them must pre-exist to everyassertion for which truth is claimed. And, not content with this overuse of one particular type of judgment, our criticsclaim its monopoly. They appear to wish to cut off Humanism from its rights to any retrospection at all.Humanism says that satisfactoriness is what distinguishes the true from the false. But satisfactoriness is both asubjective quality, and a present one. Ergo (the critics appear to reason)"},{"pageNumber":1266,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1197 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 05]Page 1197an object, quâ true, must always for humanism be both present and subjective, and a humanist's belief can never be inanything that lives outside of the belief itself or antedates it. Why so preposterous a charge should be so current, I findit hard to say. Nothing is more obvious than the fact that both the objective and the past existence of the object may bethe very things about it that most seem satisfactory, and that most invite us to believe them. The past tense can figurein the the humanist's world, as well of belief as of representation, quite as harmoniously as in the world or any oneelse.Mr. Joseph gives a special turn to this accusation. He charges me (on p. 32) with being self-contradictory when I saythat the main categories of thought were evolved in the course of experience itself. For I use these very categories todefine the course of experience by. Experience, as I talk about it, is a product of their use; and yet I take is as trueanteriorly to them. This seems to Mr. Joseph to be an absurdity. I hope it does not seem such to his readers; for ifexperiences can suggest hypotheses at all (and they notoriously do so) I can see no absurdity whatever in the notion ofa retrospective hypothesis having for its object the very train of experiences by which its own being, along with thatof other things, has been brought about. If the hypothesis is 'satisfactory' we must, of course, believe it to have beentrue anteriorly to its formulation by ourselves. Every explanation of a present by a past seems to involve this kind ofcircle, which is not a vicious circle. The past is causa existendi of the present, which in turn is causa cognoscendi ofthe past. If the present were treated as causa existendi of the past, the circle might indeed be vicious.Closely connected with this pseudo-difficulty is another one of wider scope and greater complication—moreexcusable therefore—which Mr. Joseph deals with (though in much too pettifogging and logic-chopping a way) onpages 33 and 34 of his article. Humanism, namely, asking how truth in point of fact is reached, and seeing that it is byever substituting more satisfactory for less satisfactory opinions, is thereby led into a vague historic sketch of truth'sdevelopment. The earliest 'opinions,' it thinks, must have been dim, unconnected 'feelings,' and only little by little didmore and more orderly views of things replace them. Our own retro-"},{"pageNumber":1267,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1198 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 05]Page 1198spective view of this whole evolution is now, let us say, the latest candidate for 'truth' as yet reached in the process.To be a satisfactory candidate, it must give some definite sort of a picture of what forces keep the process going. Onthe subjective side we have a fairly definite picture—sensation, association, interest, hypothesis, these account in ageneral way for the growth into a cosmos of the relative chaos with which the mind began.But on the side of the object, so to call it roughly, our view is much less satisfactory. Of which of our many objectsare we to believe that it truly was there and at work before the human mind began? Time, space, kind, number, serialorder, cause, consciousness, are hard things not to objectify—even transcendental idealism leaves them standing as'empirically real'. Substance, matter, force, fall down more easily before criticism, and secondary qualities makealmost no resistance at all. Nevertheless, when we survey the field of speculation, from Scholasticism throughKantism to Spencerism, we find an ever-recurring tendency to convert the pre-human into a merely logical object, anunknowable ding-an-sich, that but starts the process, or a vague materia prima that but receives our forms.1The reasons for this are not so much logical as they are material. We can postulate an extra-mental that freely enough(though some idealists have denied us the privilege), but when we have done so, the what of it is hard to determinesatisfactorily, because of the oppositions and entanglements of the variously proposed whats with one another andwith the history of the human mind. The literature of speculative cosmology bears witness to this difficulty.Humanism suffers from it no more than any other philosophy suffers, but it makes all our cosmogonic theories sounsatisfactory that some thinkers seek relief in the denial of any primal dualism. Absolute Thought or 'pureexperience' is postulated, and endowed with attributes calculated to justify the belief that it may \"run itself'. Both thesetruth-claiming hypotheses are non-dualistic in the old mind-and-matter sense; but the one is monistic and the otherpluralistic as to the world process1Compare some elaborate articles by M. Le Roy and M. Wilbois in the Revue de Métaphysique, vols. viii., ix. and x."},{"pageNumber":1268,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1199 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 06]Page 1199itself. Some humanists are non-dualists of this sort—I myself am one und zwar of the pluralistic brand. But doubtlessdualistic humanists also exist, as well as non-dualistic ones of the monistic wing.Mr. Joseph pins these general philosophic difficulties on humanism alone, or possibly on me alone. My article spokevaguely of a 'most chaotic pure experience' coming first, and building up the mind. But how can two structurelessthings interact so as to produce a structure? My critic triumphantly asks. Of course they can't, as purely so-namedentities. We must make additional hypotheses. We must beg a minimum of structure for them. The kind of minimumthat might have tended to increase towards what we now find actually developed is the philosophical desideratumhere. The question is that of the most materially satisfactory hypothesis. Mr. Joseph handles it by formal logic purely,as if he had no acquaintance with the logic of hypothesis at all.Mr. Joseph again is much bewildered as to what humanist can mean when he uses the word knowledge. He tries toconvict me (on p. 36) of vaguely identifying it with any kind of good. Knowledge is a difficult thing to define briefly,and Mr. Joseph shows his own constructive hand here even less than in the rest of his article. I have myself put forthon several occasions a radically pragmatist account of knowledge,1 the existence of which account my critic probablydoes not know of—so perhaps I had better not say anything about knowledge until he reads and attacks that. I willsay, however, that whatever the relation called knowing my itself prove to consist in, I can think of no conceivablekind of object which may not become an object of knowledge on humanistic principles as well as on the principles ofany other philosophy.2I confess that I am pretty steadily hampered by the habit, on the part of humanism's critics, of assuming that they have1Most recently in two articles, \"Does 'Consciousness' Exist?\" and \"A World of Pure Experience,\" in the Journal of Philosophy, NewYork, 1st Sept., 29th Sept. and 13th Oct., 1904.2For a recent attempt, effective on the whole, at squaring humanism with knowing, I may refer to Prof. Woodbridge's very able address at theSaint Louis Congress, \"The Field of Logic,\" printed in Science, N.Y., 4th November, 1904."},{"pageNumber":1269,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1200 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 06]Page 1200truer ideas than mine of truth and knowledge, the nature of which I must know of and cannot need to have re-defined.I have consequently to reconstruct these ideas in order to carry on the discussion (I have e.g. had to do so in someparts of this article) and I thereby expose myself to charges of caricature. In one part of Mr. Joseph's attack, however,I rejoice that we are free from this embarrassment. It is an important point and covers probably a genuine difficultly,so I take it up last.When, following Schiller and Dewey, I define the true as that which gives the maximal combination of satisfactions,and say that satisfaction is a many-dimensional term that can be realised in various ways, Mr. Joseph replies, rightlyenough, that the chief satisfaction of a rational creature must always be his thought that what he believes is true,whether he truth brings him the satisfaction of collateral profits of not. This would seem, however, to make of truththe prior concept, and to relegate satisfaction to a secondary place.Again, if to be satisfactory is what is meant by being true, whose satisfactions, and which of his satisfactions, are tocount? Discriminations notoriously have to be made; and the upshot is that only rational candidates and intellectualsatisfactions stand the test. We are thus driven to a purely theoretic notion of truth, and get out of the pragmaticatmosphere altogether. And with this Mr. Joseph leaves us—truth is truth, and there is an end of the matter. But hemakes a very pretty show of convicting me of self-stultification in according to our purely theoretic satisfactions anyplace in the humanistic scheme. They crowd the collateral satisfactions out of house and home, he thinks, andpragmatism has to go into bankruptcy if she recognises them at all.There is no room for disagreement about the facts here; but the destructive force of the reasoning disappears as soonas we talk concretely instead of abstractly, and ask, in our quality of good pragmatists, just what the famous theoreticneeds are known as and in what the intellectual satisfactions consist. Mr. Joseph, faithful to the habits of his party,makes no attempt at characterising them, but assumes that their nature is self-evident to all.Are they not all mere matters of consistency—and emphati-"},{"pageNumber":1270,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1201 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 07]Page 1201cally not of consistency between an Absolute Reality and the mind's copies of it, but of actually felt consistencyamong judgments, objects, and manners of reacting, in the mind? And are not both our need of such consistency andour pleasure in it conceivable as outcomes of the natural fact that we are beings that develop mental habits—habititself proving adaptively beneficial in an environment where the same objects, or the same kinds of objects, recur andfollow 'law'? If this were so, what would have come first would have been the collateral profits of habit, and thetheoretic life would have grown up in aid of these. In point of fact, this seems to have been he probable case. At life'sorigin, any present perception may have been 'true'—if such a word could then be applicable. Later, when reactionsbecame organised, the reactions became 'true' whenever expectation was fulfilled by them. Otherwise they were 'false'or 'mistaken' reactions. But the same class of objects needs the same kind of reaction, so the impulse to reactconsistently must gradually have been established, with a disappointment felt whenever the results frustratedexpectation. Here is a perfectly plausible germ for all our higher consistencies. Nowadays, if an object claims from usa reaction of the kind habitually accorded only to the opposite class of objects, our mental machinery refuses to runsmoothly. The situation is intellectually unsatisfactory. To gain relief we seek either to preserve the reaction by re-interpreting the object, or, leaving the object as it is, we react in a way contrary to the way claimed of us. Neithersolution is easy. Such a situation might be that of Mr. Joseph, with me claiming assent to humanism from him. Hecannot apperceive it so as to permit him to gratify my claim; but there is enough appeal in the claim to induce him towrite a whole article in justification of his refusal. If he should assent to humanism, on the other hand, that would dragafter it an unwelcome, yea incredible, alteration of his previous mental beliefs. Whichever alternative he might adopt,however, a new equilibrium of intellectual consistency would in the end be reached. He would feel, whichever way hedecided, that he was now thinking truly. But if, with his old habits unaltered, he should simply add to them the newone of advocating humanism quietly or noisily, his mind would be rent into"},{"pageNumber":1271,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1202 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 07]Page 1202two systems, each of which would accuse the other of falsehood. The resultant situation, being profoundlyunsatisfactory, would also be instable.Theoretic truth is thus no relation between our mind and archetypal reality. It falls within the mind, being the accordof some of its processes and objects with other processes and objects—'accord' consisting here in well-definablerelations. So long as the satisfaction of feeling such an accord is denied us, whatever collateral profits may seem toinure from what we believe in are but as dust in the balance—provided always that we are highly organisedintellectually, which the majority of us are not. The amount of accord which satisfies most men and women is merelythe absence of violent cash between their usual thoughts and statements and the limited sphere of sense-perceptions inwhich their lives are cast. The theoretic truth that most of us think we 'ought' to attain to is thus the possession of a setof predicates that do not contradict their subjects. We preserve it as often as not by leaving other predicates andsubjects out.In some men theory is a passion, just as music is in others. The form of inner consistency is pursued far beyond theline at which collateral profits stop. Such men systematise and classify and schematise and make synoptical tables andinvent ideal objects for the pure love of unifying. Too often the results, glowing with 'truth' for the inventors, seempathetically personal and artificial to bystanders. Which is as much as to say that the purely theoretic criterion of truthcan leave us in the lurch as easily as any other criterion.I think that if Mr. Joseph will but consider all these things a little more concretely, he may find that the humanisticscheme and the notion of theoretic truth fall into line consistently enough to yield him also intellectual satisfaction.Mind, April 1905"},{"pageNumber":1272,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1203 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 08]Page 1203Is Radical Empiricism Solipsistic?If all the criticisms which the humanistic Weltanschauung is receiving were as sachgemäss as Mr. Bode's in thisJOURNAL for March 2, the truth of the matter would more rapidly clear up. Not only is it excellently well written, but itbrings its own point of view out clearly, and admits of a perfectly straight reply.The argument (unless I fail to catch it) can be expressed as follows:If a series of experiences be supposed, no one of which is endowed immediately with the self-transcendent function ofreference to a reality beyond itself, no motive will occur within the series for supposing anything beyond it to exist. Itwill remain subjective, and contentedly subjective, both as a whole and in its several parts.Radical empiricism, trying, as it does, to account for objective knowledge by means of such a series, egregiously fails.It can not explain how the notion of a physical order, as distinguished from a subjectively biographical order, ofexperiences, ever arose.It pretends to explain the notion of a physical order, but does so by playing fast and loose with the concept ofobjective reference. On he one hand, it denies that such reference implies self-transcendency on the part of any oneexperience; on the other hand, it claims that experiences point. But, critically considered, there can be no pointingunless self-transcendency be also allowed. The conjunctive function of pointing, as I have assumed it, is, according tomy critic, vitiated by he fallacy of attaching a bilateral relation to a term a quo, as if it could stick out substantivelyand maintain itself in existence in advance of the term ad quem which is equally required for it to be a concretelyexperienced fact. If the relation be made concrete, the term ad quem is involved, which would mean (if I succeed inapprehending Mr. Bode rightly) that this latter term, although not empirically there, is yet noetically there, in advance—in other words it would mean that any experience that 'points' must already have transcended itself, in the ordinary'epistemological' sense of the word transcend."},{"pageNumber":1273,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1204 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 08]Page 1204Something like this, if I understand Mr. Bode's text, is the upshot of his state of mind. It is a reasonable sounding stateof mind, but it is exactly the state of mind which radical empiricism, but its doctrine of the reality of conjunctiverelations, seeks to dispel. I very much fear—so difficult does mutual understanding seem in these exalted regions—that my able critic has failed to understand that doctrine as it is meant to be understood. I suspect that he performs onall these conjunctive relations (of which the aforesaid 'pointing' is only one) the usual rationalistic act of substitution—he takes them not as they are given in their first intention, as parts constitutive of experience's living flow, but only asthey appear in retrospect, each fixed as a determinate object of conception, static, therefore, and contained withinitself.Against this rationalistic tendency to treat experience as chopped up into discontinuous static objects, radicalempiricism protests. It insists on taking conjunctions at their 'face-value,' just as they come. Consider, for example,such conjunctions as 'and,' 'with,' 'near,' 'plus,' 'towards.' While we live in such conjunctions our state is one oftransition in the most literal sense. We are expectant of a 'more' to come, and before the more has come, thetransition, nevertheless, is directed towards it. I fail otherwise to see how, if one kind of more comes, there should besatisfaction and feeling of fulfillment; but disappointment if the more comes in another shape. One more will continue,another more will arrest or deflect the direction, in which our experience is moving even now. We can not, it is true,name our different living 'ands' or 'withs' except by naming the different terms towards which they are moving us, butwe live their specifications and differences before those terms explicitly arrive. Thus, though the various 'ands' are allbilateral relations, each requiring a term ad quem to define it when viewed in retrospect and articulately conceived, yetin its living moment any one of them may be treated as if it 'stuck out' from its term a quo and pointed in a specialdirection, much as a compass-needle (to use Mr. Bode's excellent simile) points at the pole, even though it stirs notfrom its box.In professor Höffding's massive little article in a recent"},{"pageNumber":1274,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1205 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 09]Page 1205number of this JOURNAL,1 he quotes a saying of Kierkegaard's to the effect that we live forwards, but we understandbackwards. Understanding backwards is, it must be confessed, a very frequent weakness of philosophers, both of therationalistic and of the ordinary empiricist type. Radical empiricism alone insists on understanding forwards also, andrefuses to substitute static concepts of the understanding for transitions in our moving life. A logic similar to thatwhich my critic seems to employ here should, it seems to me, forbid him to say that out present is, while present,directed towards our future, or that any physical movement can have direction until its goal is actually reached.At this point does it not seem as if the quarrel about self-transcendency in knowledge might drop? Is it not a purelyverbal dispute? Call it self-transcendency or call it pointing, whichever you like—it makes no difference so long asreal transitions towards real goals are admitted as things given in experience, and among experience's mostindefeasible parts. Radical empiricism, unable to close its eyes to the transitions caught in actu, accounts for the self-transcendency or the pointing (whichever you may call it) as a process that occurs within experience, as an empiricallymediated thing of which a perfectly definite description can be given. 'Epistemology,' on the other hand, denies this;and pretends that the self-transcendency is unmediated or, if mediated, then mediated in a super-empirical world. Tojustify this pretension, epistemology has first to transform all our conjunctions into static objects, and this, I submit, isan absolutely arbitrary act. But in spite of Mr. Bode's maltreatment of conjunctions, as I understand them—and as Iunderstand him—I believe that at bottom we are fighting for nothing different, but are both defending the samecontinuities of experience in different forms of words.There are other criticisms in the article in question, but, as this seems the most vital one, I will for the present, at anyrate, leave them untouched.1Vol. II., No. 4, pp. 85 92.The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods,April 27, 1905"},{"pageNumber":1275,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1206 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 09]Page 1206The Place of Affectional Facts in a World of Pure ExperienceCommon Sense and popular philosophy are as dualistic as it is possible to be. Thoughts, we all naturally think, aremade of one kind of substance, and things of another. Consciousness, flowing inside of us in the forms of conceptionor judgment, or concentrating itself in the shape of passion or emotion, can be directly felt as the spiritual activitywhich it is, and known in contrast with the space-filling objective 'content' which it envelopes and accompanies. Inopposition to this dualistic philosophy, I tried, in a recent article in this JOURNAL,1 to show that thoughts and things areabsolutely homogeneous as to their material, and that their opposition is only one of relation and of function. There isno thought-stuff different from thing-stuff, I said; but the same identical piece of 'pure experience' (which was thename I gave to the materia prima of everything) can stand alternately for a 'fact of consciousness' or for a physicalreality, according as it is taken in one context or in another. For the right understanding of what follows, I shall haveto presuppose that the reader will have read that earliest article.2The commonest objection which the doctrine there laid down runs up against is drawn from the existence of our'affections.' In our pleasures and pains, our loves and fears and angers, in the beauty, comicality, importance orpreciousness of certain objects and situations, we have, I am told by many critics, a great realm of experienceintuitively recognized as spiritual, made, and felt to be made, of consciousness exclusively, and different in naturefrom the space-filling kind of being which is enjoyed by physical objects. In Section VII. of that earlier article, Itreated of this class of experiences very inadequately, because I had to be so brief. I now return to the Subject,because I believe that, so far from invalidating my1'Does Consciousness Exist?'

Any one 'content,' such as hard, let us say,can be assigned to either group. In the outer group it is 'strong,' it acts 'energetically' and aggressively. Here whateveris hard interferes with the space its neighbors occupy. It dents them; is impenetrable by them; and we call the hardnessthen a physical hardness. In the mind, on the contrary, the hard thing is nowhere in particular, it dents nothing, itsuffuses through its mental neighbors, as it were, and interpenetrates them. Taken in this group we call both it andthem 'ideas' or 'sensations'; and the basis of the two groups respectively is the different type of interrelation, themutual impenetrability, on the one hand, and the lack of physical interference and interaction, on the other.That what in itself is one and the same entity should be able to function thus differently in different contexts is anatural consequence of the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come. To her offspring a tigressis tender, but cruel to every other living thing—both cruel and tender, therefore, at once. A mass in movement resistsevery force that operates contrariwise to its own direction, but to forces that pursue the same direction, or come in atright angles, it is absolutely inert. It is thus both energetic and inert; and the same is true (if you vary the associatesproperly) of every other piece of experience. It is only towards certain specific groups of associates that the physicalenergies, as we call them, of a content are put forth. In another group it may be quite inert.It is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only alternative between neighbors would be eitherphysical interaction or complete inertness. In such a world the mental or the physical status of any piece of experiencewould be unequivocal. When active, it would figure in the physical, and when inactive, in the mental group.But the universe we live in is more chaotic than this, and there is room in it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our"},{"pageNumber":1277,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1208 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 10]Page 1208affectional experiences, of our emotions and appreciative perceptions. In the paragraphs that follow I shall try toshow:(1) That the popular notion that these experiences are intuitively given as purely inner facts is hasty and erroneous;and(2) That their ambiguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that subjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of whatan experience is aboriginally made of, but of its classification. Classifications depend on our temporary purposes. Forcertain purposes it is convenient to take things in one set of relations, for other purposes in another set. In the twocases their contexts are apt to be different. In the case of our affectional experiences we have no permanent andsteadfast purpose that obliges us to be consistent, so we find it easy to let them float ambiguously, sometimes classingthem with our feelings, sometimes with more physical realities, according to caprice or to the convenience of themoment. Thus would these experiences, so far from being an obstacle to the pure-experience philosophy, serve as anexcellent corroboration of its truth.First of all, then, it is a mistake to say, with the objectors whom I began by citing, that anger, love and fear areaffections purely of the mind. That, to a great extent at any rate, they are simultaneously affections of the body isproved by the whole literature of the James-Lange theory of emotion. All our pains, moreover, are local, and we arealways free to speak of them in objective as well as in subjective terms. We can say that we are aware of a painfulplace, filling a certain bigness in our organism, or we can say that we are inwardly in a 'state' of pain. All ouradjectives of worth are similarly ambiguous—I instanced some of the ambiguities on page 490 of the former article. Isthe preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem? or is it a feeling in our mind? Practically we treat it as both or aseither, according to the temporary direction of our thought. 'Beauty,' says Professor Santayana, 'is pleasure objectified';and in Sections 10 and 11 of his work, 'The Sense of Beauty,' he treats in a masterly way of this equivocal realm. Thevarious pleasures we receive from an object may count as 'feelings' when we take them singly, but when theycombine in a total richness, we call the result the"},{"pageNumber":1278,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1209 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 10]Page 1209'beauty' of the object, and treat it as an outer attribute which our mind perceives. We discover beauty just as wediscover the physical properties of things. Training is needed to make us expert in either line. Single sensations alsomay be ambiguous. Shall we say an 'agreeable degree of heat,' or an 'agreeable feeling' occasioned by the degree ofheart? Either will do; and language would lose most of its esthetic and rhetorical value were we forbidden to projectwords primarily connoting our affections upon the objects by which the affections are aroused. The man is reallyhateful; the action really mean; the situation really tragic—all in themselves and quite apart from our opinion. Weeven go so far as to talk of a weary road, a giddy height, a jocund morning or a sullen sky; and the term 'indefinite'while usually applied only to our apprehensions, functions as a fundamental physical qualification of things inSpencer's 'law of evolution,' and doubtless passes with most readers for all right.Psychologists, studying our perceptions of movement, have unearthed experiences in which movement is felt ingeneral but not ascribed correctly to the body that really moves. Thus in optical vertigo, caused by unconsciousmovements of our eyes, both we and the external universe appear to be in a whirl. When clouds float by the moon, itis as if both clouds and moon and we ourselves shared in the motion. In the extraordinary case of amnesia of the Rev.Mr. Hanna, published by Sidis and Goodhart in their important work on 'Multiple Personality' (New York: Appleton,1905) we read that when the patient first recovered consciousness and ''noticed an attendant walk across the room, heidentified the movement with his own. He did not yet discriminate between his own movements and those outsidehimself\" (p. 102). Such experiences point to a primitive stage of perception in which discriminations afterwardsneedful have not yet been made. A piece of experience of a determinate sort is there, but there at first as a 'pure' fact.Motion originally simply is; only later is it confined to this thing or to that. Something like this is true of everyexperience, however complex, at the moment of its actual presence. Let the reader arrest himself in the act of readingthis article now. Now this is a pure experience, a phenomenon, or datum, a mere that or content of fact.

At the moment, it is there for neither; later we shall probably judge it to have been there for both.With the affectional experiences which we are considering, the relatively 'pure' condition lasts. In practical life nourgent need has yet arisen for deciding whether to treat them as rigorously mental or as rigorously physical facts. Sothey remain equivocal; and, as the world goes, their equivocality is one of their great conveniences.The shifting place of 'secondary qualities' in the history of philosophy is another excellent proof of the fact that 'inner'and 'outer' are not coefficients with which experiences come to us aboriginally stamped, but are rather results of alater classification performed by us for particular needs. The common-sense stage of thought is a perfectly definitepractical halting-place, the place where we ourselves can proceed to act unhesitatingly. On this stage of thought thingsact on each other as well as on us by means of their secondary qualities. Sound, as such, goes through the air and canbe intercepted. The heat of the fire passes over, as such, into the water which it sets a-boiling. It is the very light ofthe arc-lamp which displaces the darkness of the midnight street, etc. By engendering and translocating just thesequalities, actively efficacious as they seem to be, we ourselves succeed in altering nature so as to suit us; and untilmore purely intellectual, as distinguished from practical, needs had arisen, no one ever thought of calling thesequalities subjective. When, however, Galileo, Descartes, and others found it best for philosophic purposes to classsound, heat and light along with pain and pleasure as purely mental phenomena, they could do so with impunity.Even the primary qualities are undergoing the same fate. Hardness and softness are effects on us of atomicinteractions, and the atoms themselves are neither hard nor soft, nor solid nor liquid. Size and shape are deemedsubjective by Kantians; time itself is subjective according to many philosophers; and even the activity and causalefficacy which lingered in physics long after secondary qualities were banished are now treated as illusory projectionsoutwards of phenomena of our own"},{"pageNumber":1280,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1211 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 11]Page 1211consciousness. There are no activities or effects in nature, for the most intellectual contemporary school of physicalspeculation. Nature exhibits only changes, which habitually coincide with one another so that their habits aredescribable in simple 'laws.'There is no original spirituality or materiality of being, intuitively discerned, then; but only a translocation ofexperiences from one world to another; a grouping of them with one set or another of associates for definitelypractical or intellectual ends.I will say nothing here of the persistent ambiguity of relations. They are undeniable parts of pure experience; yet,while common sense and what I call radical empiricism stand for their being objective, both rationalism and the usualempiricism claim that they are exclusively the 'work of the mind'—the finite mind or the absolute mind, as the casemay be.Turn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us.We soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our interests and emotions from the ways in which theyact upon one another. It does not work to assume that physical objects are going to act on one another by theirsympathetic or antipathetic qualities. The beauty of a thing or its value is no force that can be plotted in a polygon ofcompositions, nor does its 'use' or 'significance' affect in the minutest degree its vicissitudes or destiny at the hands ofphysical nature. Chemical 'affinities' are a purely verbal metaphor; and, as I just said, even such things as forces,tensions and activities can at a pinch be regarded as anthropomorphic projections. So far, then, as the physical worldmeans the collection of contents that determine in each other certain regular changes, the whole collection of ourappreciative attributes has to be treated as falling outside of it. If we mean by physical nature whatever lies beyond thesurface of our bodies, these attributes are inert throughout the whole extent of physical nature.Why then do men leave them as ambiguous as they do, and not class them decisively as purely spiritual?"},{"pageNumber":1281,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1212 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 11]Page 1212The reason would seem to be that, although they are inert as regards the rest of physical nature, they are not inert asregards that part of physical nature which our own skin covers. It is those very appreciative attributes of things, theirdangerousness, beauty, rarity, utility, etc., that primarily appeal to our attention. In our commerce with nature theseattributes are what give emphasis to objects; and for an object to be emphatic, whatever spiritual fact it may mean,means also that it produces immediate bodily effects upon us, alterations of tone and tension, of heart-beat andbreathing, of vascular and visceral action. The 'interesting' aspects of things are thus not wholly inert physically,though they be active only in these small corners of physical nature which our bodies occupy. That, however, isenough to save them from being classed as absolutely non-objective.The attempt, if any one should make it, to sort experiences into two absolutely discrete groups, with nothing butinertness in one of them and nothing but activities in the other, would thus receive one check. It would receive anotheras soon as we examined the more distinctively mental group; for though in that group it be true that things do not acton one another by their physical properties, do not dent each other or set fire to each other, they yet act on each otherin the most energetic way by those very characters which are so inert extracorporeally. It is by the interest andimportance that experiences have for us, by the emotions they excite, and the purposes they subserve, by theiraffective values, in short, that their consecution in our several conscious streams, as 'thoughts' of ours, is mainly ruled.Desire introduces them; interest holds them; fitness fixes their order and connection. I need only refer for this aspectof our mental life, to Wundt's article 'Ueber psychische Causalität,' which begins Volume X. of his PhilosophischeStudien.1It thus appears that the ambiguous or amphibious status which we find our epithets of value occupying is the mostnatural thing in the world. It would, however, be an unnat-1It is enough for my present purpose if the appreciative characters but seem to act thus.

If 'physical' and 'mental' meant two differentkinds of intrinsic nature, immediately, intuitively, and infallibly discernible, and each fixed forever in whatever bit ofexperience it qualified, one does not see how there could ever have arisen any room for doubt or ambiguity. But if, onthe contrary, these words are words of sorting, ambiguity is natural. For then, as soon as the relations of a thing aresufficiently various it can be sorted variously. Take a mass of carrion, for example, and the 'disgustingness' which forus is part of the experience. The sun caresses it, and the zephyr wooes it as if it were a bed of roses. So thedisgustingness fails to operate within the realm of suns and breezes,—it does not function as a physical quality. Butthe carrion 'turns our stomach' by what seems a direct operation—it does function physically, therefore, in that limitedpart of physics. We can treat it as physical or as non-physical, as a mass or as a perception, according as we take it inthe narrower or in the wider context, and conversely, of course, we must treat it as non-mental or as mental.Our body itself is the palmary instance of the ambiguous. Sometimes I treat my body purely as a part of outer nature.Sometimes, again, I think of it as 'mine,' I sort it with the 'me,' and then certain local changes and determinations in itpass for spiritual happenings. Its breathing is my 'thinking,' its sensorial adjustments are my 'attention,' its kinestheticalterations are my 'efforts,' its visceral perturbations are my 'emotions.' The obstinate controversies that have arisenover such statements as these (which sound so paradoxical, and which can yet be made so seriously) prove how hardit is to decide by bare introspection what it is in experiences that shall make them either spiritual or material. It surelycan be nothing intrinsic in the individual experiences. It is their way of behaving towards each other, their system ofrelations, their function; and all these things vary with the context in which we find it opportune to consider them.I think I may conclude, then (and I hope that my readers are now ready to conclude with me), that the pretendedspirituality of our emotions and of our attributes of value, so far from proving an objection to the philosophy of pure"},{"pageNumber":1283,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1214 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 12]Page 1214experience, does, when rightly discussed and accounted for, serve as one of its best corroborations.The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods,May 25, 1905"},{"pageNumber":1284,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1215 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 12]Page 1215On Some Mental Effects of the EarthquakeWhen I departed from Harvard for Stanford University last December, almost the last good-by I got was that of myold Californian friend B.: \"I hope they'll give you a touch of earthquake while you're there, so that you may alsobecome acquainted with that Californian institution.\"Accordingly, when, lying awake at about half past five on the morning of April 18th in my little \"flat\" on the campusof Stanford, I felt the bed begin to waggle, my first consciousness was one of gleeful recognition of the nature of themovement. \"By Jove,\" I said to myself, ''here's B.'s old earthquake, after all!\" And then, as it went crescendo, \"And ajolly good one it is, too!\" I said.Sitting up involuntarily, and taking a kneeling position, I was thrown down on my face as it went fortior shaking theroom exactly as a terrier shakes a rat. Then everything that was on anything else slid off to the floor, over went bureauand chiffonier with a crash, as the fortissimo was reached, plaster cracked, an awful roaring noise seemed to fill theouter air, and in an instant all was still again, save the soft babble of human voices from far and near that soon beganto make itself heard, as the inhabitants in costumes negligés in various degrees sought the greater safety of the streetand yielded to the passionate desire for sympathetic communication.The thing was over, as I understand the Lick Observatory to have declared, in forty-eight seconds. To me it felt as ifabout that length of time, although I have heard others say that it seemed to them longer. In my case, sensation andemotion were so strong that little thought, and no reflection or volition, were possible in the short time consumed bythe phenomenon.The emotion consisted wholly of glee and admiration; glee at the vividness which such an abstract idea or verbal termas \"earthquake\" could put on when translated into sensible reality and verified concretely; and admiration at the wayin which the frail little wooden house could hold itself together in spite of such a shaking. I felt no trace whatever offear; it was pure delight and welcome."},{"pageNumber":1285,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1216 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 13]Page 1216\"Go it,\" I almost cried aloud, \"and go it stronger!\"I ran into my wife's room, and found that she, although awakened from sound sleep, had felt no fear, either. Of all thepersons whom I later interrogated, very few had felt any fear while the shaking lasted, although many had had a\"turn,\" as they realized their narrow escapes from bookcases or bricks from chimney-breasts falling on their beds andpillows an instant after they had left them.As soon as I could think, I discerned retrospectively certain peculiar ways in which my consciousness had taken in thephenomenon. These ways were quite spontaneous, and, so to speak, inevitable and irresistible.First, I personified the earthquake as a permanent individual entity. It was the earthquake of my friend B.'s augury,which had been lying low and holding itself back during all the intervening months, in order, on that lustrous Aprilmorning, to invade my room, and energize the more intensely and triumphantly. It came, moreover, directly to me. Itstole in behind my back, and once inside the room, had me all to itself, and could manifest itself convincingly.Animus and intent were never more present in any human action, nor did any human activity ever more definitelypoint back to a living agent as its source and origin.All whom I consulted on the point agreed as to this feature in their experience. \"It expressed intention,\" \"It wasvicious,\" \"It was bent on destruction,\" ''It wanted to show its power,\" or what not. To me, it wanted simply to manifestthe full meaning of its name. But what was this \"It\"? To some, apparently, a vague demonic power; to me anindividualized being, B.'s earthquake, namely.One informant interpreted it as the end of the world and the beginning of the final judgement. This was a lady in aSan Francisco hotel, who did not think of its being an earthquake till after she had got into the street and some onehad explained it to her. She told me that the theological interpretation had kept fear from her mind, and made her takethe shaking calmly. For \"science,\" when the tensions in the earth's crust reach the breaking-point, and strata fall intoan altered equilibrium, earthquake is simply the collective name of all the cracks and shakings and disturbances thathappen. They"},{"pageNumber":1286,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1217 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 13]Page 1217are the earthquake. But for me the earthquake was the cause of the disturbances, and the perception of it as a livingagent was irresistible. It had an overpowering dramatic convincingness.I realize now better than ever how inevitable were men's earlier mythologic versions of such catastrophes, and howartificial and against the grain of our spontaneous perceiving are the later habits into which science educates us. It wassimply impossible for untutored men to take earthquakes into their minds as anything but supernatural warnings orretributions.A good instance of the way in which the tremendousness of a catastrophe may banish fear was given me by a Stanfordstudent. He was in the fourth story of Encina Hall, an immense stone dormitory building. Awakened from sleep, herecognized what the disturbance was, and sprang from the bed, but was thrown off his feet in a moment, while hisbooks and furniture fell round him. Then, with an awful, sinister, grinding roar, everything gave way, and withchimneys, floorbeams, walls and all, he descended through the three lower stories of the building in to the basement.\"This is my end, this is my death,\" he felt; but all the while no trace of fear. The experience was too overwhelming foranything but passive surrender to it. (Certain heavy chimneys had fallen in, carrying the whole center of the buildingwith them.)Arrived at the bottom, he found himself with rafters and débris round him, but not pinned in or crushed. He sawdaylight, and crept toward it through the obstacles. Then, realizing that he was in his nightgown, and feeling no painanywhere, his first thought was to get back to his room and find some more presentable clothing. The stairways atEncina Hall are at the ends of the building. He made his way to one of them, and went up the four flights, only to findhis room no longer extant. Then he noticed pain in his feet, which had been injured, and came down the stairs withdifficulty. When he talked with me ten days later he had been in hospital a week, was very thin and pale, and went oncrutches, and was dressed in borrowed clothing.So much for Stanford, where all our experiences seem to have been very similar. Nearly all our chimneys went down,some of them disintegrating from top to bottom; parlor"},{"pageNumber":1287,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1218 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 14]Page 1218floors were covered with bricks; plaster strewed the floors; furniture was everywhere upset and dislocated; but thewooden dwellings sprang back to their original position, and in house after house not a window stuck or a doorscraped at top or bottom. Wood architecture was triumphant! Everybody was excited, but the excitement at first, atany rate, seemed to be almost joyous. Here at last was a real earthquake after so many years of harmless waggle!Above all, there was an irresistible desire to talk about it, and exchange experiences.Most people slept outdoors for several subsequent nights, partly to be safer in case of a recurrence, but also to workoff their emotion, and get the full unusualness out of the experience. The vocal babble of early-waking girls and boysfrom the gardens of the campus, mingling with the birds' songs and the exquisite weather, was for three or four days adelightful sunrise phenomenon.Now turn to San Francisco, thirty-five miles distant, from which an automobile ere long brought us the dire news of acity in ruins, with fires beginning at various points, and the water-supply interrupted. I was fortunate enough to boardthe only train of cars—a very small one—that got up to the city; fortunate enough also to escape in the evening by theonly train that left it. This gave me and my valiant feminine escort some four hours of observation. My business iswith \"subjective\" phenomena exclusively; so I will say nothing of the material ruin that greeted us on every hand—thedaily papers and the weekly journals have done full justice to that topic. By midday, when we reached the city, the pallof smoke was vast and the dynamite detonations had begun, but the troops, the police and the firemen seemed to haveestablished order, dangerous neighborhoods were roped off everywhere and picketed, saloons closed, vehiclesimpressed, and every one at work who could work.It was indeed a strange sight to see an entire population in the streets, busy as ants in an uncovered ant-hill scurryingto save their eggs and larvæae. Every horse, and everything on wheels in the city, from hucksters' wagons toautomobiles, was being loaded with what effects could be scraped together from houses which the advancing flameswere threatening."},{"pageNumber":1288,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1219 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 14]Page 1219The sidewalks were covered with well-dressed men and women, carrying baskets, bundles, valises, or dragging trunksto spots of greater temporary safety, soon to be dragged farther, as the fire kept spreading!In the safer quarters, every door-step was covered with the dwelling's tenants, sitting surrounded with their moreindispensable chattels, and ready to flee at a minute's notice. I think every one must have fasted on that day, for I sawno one eating. There was no appearance of general dismay, and little of chatter or of incoördinated excitement.Every one seemed doggedly bent on achieving the job which he had set himself to perform; and the faces, althoughsomewhat tense and set and grave, were inexpressive of emotion. I noticed only three persons overcome, two Italianwomen, very poor, embracing an aged fellow countrywoman, and all weeping. Physical fatigue and seriousness werethe only inner states that one could read on countenances.With lights forbidden in the houses, and the streets lighted only by the conflagration, it was apprehended that thecriminals of San Francisco would hold high carnival on the ensuing night. But whether they feared the disciplinarymethods of the United States troops, who were visible everywhere, or whether they were themselves solemnized bythe immensity of the disaster, they lay low and did not \"manifest,\" either then or subsequently.The only very discreditable thing to human nature that occurred was later, when hundreds of lazy \"bummers\" foundthat they could keep camping in the parks, and make alimentary storage-batteries of their stomachs, even in somecases getting enough of the free rations in their huts or tents to last them well into the summer. This charm ofpauperized vagabondage seems all along to have been Satan's most serious bait to human nature. There was theft fromthe outset, but confined, I believe, to petty pilfering.Cash in hand was the only money, and millionaires and their families were no better off in this respect than any one.Whoever got a vehicle could have the use of it; but the richest often went without, and spent the first two nights onrugs on the bare ground, with nothing but what their own arms had rescued. Fortunately, those nights were dry andcomparatively"},{"pageNumber":1289,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1220 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 14]Page 1220warm, and Californians are accustomed to camping conditions in the summer, so suffering from exposure was lessgreat than it would have been elsewhere. By the fourth night, which was rainy, tents and huts had brought mostcampers under cover.I went through the city again eight days later. The fire was out, and about a quarter of the area stood unconsumed.Intact sky-scrapers dominated the smoking level majestically and superbly—they and a few walls that had survivedthe overthrow. Thus has the courage of our architects and builders received triumphant vindication!The inert elements of the population had mostly got away, and those that remained seemed what Mr. H. G. Wells calls\"efficients.\" Sheds were already going up as temporary starting-points of business. Every one looked cheerful, in spiteof the awful discontinuity of past and future, with every familiar association with material things dissevered; and thediscipline and order were practically perfect.As these notes of mine must be short, I had better turn to my more generalized reflections.Two things in retrospect strike me especially, and are the most emphatic of all my impressions. Both are reassuring asto human nature.The first of these was the rapidity of the improvisation of order out of chaos. It is clear that just as in every thousandhuman beings there will be statistically so many artists, so many athletes, so many thinkers, and so many potentiallygood soldiers, so there will be so many potential organizers in times of emergency. In point of fact, not only in thegreat city, but in the outlying towns, these natural order-makers, whether amateurs or officials, came to the frontimmediately. There seemed to be no possibility which there was not some one there to think of, or which withintwenty-four hours was not in some way provided for.A good illustration is this: Mr. Keith is the great landscape-painter of the Pacific slope, and his pictures, which aremany, are artistically and pecuniarily precious. Two citizens, lovers of his work, early in the day diverted theirattention from all other interests, their own private ones included, and made it their duty to visit every place whichthey knew to contain a"},{"pageNumber":1290,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1221 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 15]Page 1221Keith painting. They cut them from their frames, rolled them up, and in this way got all the more important ones intoa place of safety.When they then sought Mr. Keith, to convey the joyous news to him, they found him still in his studio, which wasremote from the fire, beginning a new painting. Having given up his previous work for lost, he had resolved to lose notime in making what amends he could for the disaster.The completeness of organization at Palo Alto, a town of ten thousand inhabitants close to Stanford University, wasalmost comical. People feared exodus on a large scale of the rowdy elements of San Francisco. In point of fact, veryfew refugees came to Palo Alto. But within twenty-four hours, rations, clothing, hospital, quarantine, disinfection,washing, police, military, quarters in camp and in houses, printed information, employment, all were provided forunder the care of so many volunteer committees.Much of this readiness was American, much of it Californian; but I believe that every country in a similar crisis wouldhave displayed it in a way to astonish the spectators. Like soldiering, it lies always latent in human nature.The second thing that struck me was the universal equanimity. We soon got letters from the East, ringing with anxietyand pathos; but I now know fully what I have always believed, that the pathetic way of feeling great disasters belongsrather to the point of view of people at a distance than to the immediate victims. I heard not a single really pathetic orsentimental word in California expressed by any one.The terms \"awful,\" \"dreadful\" fell often enough from people's lips, but always with a sort of abstract meaning, andwith a face that seemed to admire the vastness of the catastrophe as much as it bewailed it cuttingness. When talk wasnot directly practical, I might almost say that it expressed (at any rate in the nine days I was there) a tendency moretoward nervous excitement than toward grief. The hearts concealed private bitterness enough, no doubt, but thetongues disdained to dwell on the misfortunes of self, when almost everybody one spoke to had suffered equally.Surely the cutting edge of all our usual misfortunes comes from their character of loneliness. We lose our health, our"},{"pageNumber":1291,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1222 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 15]Page 1222wife or children die, our house burns down, or our money is made way with, and the world goes on rejoicing, leavingus on one side and counting us out from all its business. In California every one, to some degree, was suffering, andone's private miseries were merged in the vast general sum of privation and in the all-absorbing practical problem ofgeneral recuperation. The cheerfulness, or, at any rate, the steadfastness of tone, was universal. Not a single whine orplaintive word did I hear from the hundred losers whom I spoke to. Instead of that there was a temper of helpfulnessbeyond the counting.It is easy to glorify this as something characteristically American, or especially Californian. Californian education has,of course, made the thought of all possible recuperations easy. In an exhausted country, with no marginal resources,the outlook on the future would be much darker. But I like to think that what I write of is a normal and universal traitof human nature. In our drawing-rooms and offices we wonder how people ever do go through battles, sieges, andshipwrecks. We quiver and sicken in imagination, and think those heroes superhuman. Physical pain, whether sufferedalone or in company, is always more or less unnerving and intolerable. But mental pathos and anguish, I fancy, areusually effects of distance. At the place of action, where all are concerned together, healthy animal insensibility andheartiness take their place. At San Francisco the need will continue to be awful, and there will doubtless be a crop ofnervous wrecks before the weeks and months are over, but meanwhile the commonest men, simply because they aremen, will go on, singly and collectively, showing this admirable fortitude of temper.The Youth's Companion, June 7, 1906"},{"pageNumber":1292,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1223 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 15]Page 1223The Energies of Men1We habitually hear much nowadays of the difference between structural and functional psychology. I am not sure thatI understand the difference, but it probably has something to do with what I have privately been accustomed todistinguish as the analytical and the clinical points of view in psychological observation. Professor Sanford, in arecently published \"Sketch of a Beginner's Course in Psychology,\" recommended \"the physician's attitude\" in thatsubject as the thing the teacher should first of all try to impart to the pupil. I fancy that few of you can have readProfessor Pierre Janet's masterly works in mental pathology without being struck by the little use he makes of themachinery usually relied on by psychologists, and by his own reliance on conceptions which in the laboratories and inscientific publications we never hear of at all.Discriminations and associations, the rise and fall of thresholds, impulses and inhibitions, fatigue,—these are theterms into which our inner life is analyzed by psychologists who are not doctors, and in which, by hook or crook, itsaberrations from normality have to be expressed. They can indeed be described, after the fact, in such terms, butalways lamely; and everyone must feel how much is unaccounted for, how much left out.When we turn to Janet's pages, we find entirely other forms of thought employed. Oscillations of the level of mentalenergy, differences of tension, splittings of consciousness, sentiments of insufficiency and of unreality, substitutions,agitations and anxieties, depersonalizations—such are the elementary conceptions which the total view of his patient'slife imposes on this clinical observer. They have little or nothing to do with the usual laboratory categories. Ask ascientific psychologist to predict what symptoms a patient must have when his 'supply of mental energy' diminishes,and he can utter only the word 'fatigue.' He could never predict such consequences as Janet subsumes under his oneterm 'psych-1Delivered as the Presidential Address before the American Philosophical Association at Columbia University, December 28, 1906."},{"pageNumber":1293,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1224 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 16]Page 1224asthenia'—the most bizarre obsessions and agitations, the most complete distortions of the relation between the selfand the world.I do not vouch for Janet's conceptions being valid, and I do not say that the two ways of looking at the mind contradicteach other or are mutually incongruous; I simply say that they are incongruent. Each covers so little of our totalmental life that they do not even interfere or jostle. Meanwhile the clinical conceptions, though they may be vaguerthan the analytic ones, are certainly more adequate, give the concrete picture of the way the whole mind works, andare of far more urgent practical importance. So the 'physician's attitude,' the 'functional psychology,' is assuredly thething most worthy of general study to-day.I wish to spend this hour on one conception of functional psychology, a conception never once mentioned or heard ofin laboratory circles, but used perhaps more than any other by common, practical men—I mean the conception of theamount of energy available for running one's mental and moral operations by. Practically every one knows in his ownperson the difference between the days when the tide of this energy his high in him and those when it is low, thoughno one knows exactly what reality the term energy covers when used here, or what its tides, tensions, and levels are inthemselves. This vagueness is probably the reason why our scientific psychologists ignore the conception altogether. Itundoubtedly connects itself with the energies of the nervous system, but it presents fluctuations that cannot easily betranslated into neural terms. It offers itself as the notion of a quantity, but its ebbs and floods produce extraordinaryqualitative results. To have its level raised is the most important thing that can happen to a man, yet in all my readingI know of no single page or paragraph of a scientific psychology book in which it receives mention—thepsychologists have left it to be treated by the moralists and mind-curers and doctors exclusively.Every one is familiar with the phenomenon of feeling more or less alive on different days.

Most of us feel as if we lived habitually with a sort of cloud weighing on us, below ourhighest notch of clearness in discernment, sureness in reasoning, or firmness in deciding. Compared with what weought to be, we are only half-awake. Our fires are damped, our drafts are checked. We are making use of only a smallpart of our possible mental and physical resources. In some persons this sense of being cut off from their rightfulresources is extreme, and we then get the formidable neurasthenic and psychasthenic conditions, with life grown intoone tissue of impossibilities, that the medical books describe.Part of the imperfect vitality under which we labor can be explained by scientific psychology. It is the result of theinhibition exerted by one part of our ideas on other parts. Conscience makes cowards of us all. Social conventionsprevent us from telling the truth after the fashion of the heroes and heroines of Bernard Shaw. Our scientificrespectability keeps us from exercising the mystical portions of our nature freely. If we are doctors, our mind-curesympathies, if we are mindcurists, our medical sympathies are tied up. We all know persons who are models ofexcellence, but who belong to the extreme philistine type of mind. So deadly is their intellectual respectability that wecan't converse about certain subjects at all, can't let our minds play over them, can't even mention them in theirpresence. I have numbered among my dearest friends persons thus inhibited intellectually, with whom I would gladlyhave been able to talk freely about certain interests of mine, certain authors say, as Bernard Shaw, Chesterton, EdwardCarpenter, H. G. Wells, but it wouldn't do, it made them too uncomfortable, they wouldn't play, I had to be silent. Anintellect thus tied down by literality and decorum makes on one the same sort of impression that an ablebodied manwould who should habituate himself to do his work with only one of his fingers, locking up the rest of his organismand leaving it unused.In few of us are functions not tied-up by the exercise of other functions.

Yet many of us are well aware how much freer in many directions and able our liveswould be, were such important forms of energizing not sealed up. There are in everyone potential forms of activitythat actually are shunted out from use.The existence of reservoirs of energy that habitually are not tapped is most familiar to us in the phenomenon of'second wind.' Ordinarily we stop when we meet the first effective layer, so to call it, of fatigue. We have then walked,played, or worked 'enough,' and desist. That amount of fatigue is an efficacious obstruction, on this side of which ourusual life is cast. But if an unusual necessity forces us to press onward, a surprising thing occurs. The fatigue getsworse up to a certain critical point, when gradually or suddenly it passes away, and we are fresher than before. Wehave evidently tapped a level of new energy, masked until then by the fatigue-obstacle usually obeyed. There may belayer after layer of this experience. A third and a fourth 'wind' may supervene. Mental activity shows the phenomenonas well as physical, and in exceptional cases we may find, beyond the very extremity of fatigue distress, amounts ofease and power that we never dreamed ourselves to own, sources of strength habitually not taxes at all, becausehabitually we never push through the obstruction, never pass those early critical points.When we do pass, what makes us do so?Either some unusual stimulus fills us with emotional excitement, or some unusual idea of necessity induces us to makean extra effort of will. Excitements, ideas, and efforts, in a word, are what carry us over the dam.In those hyperesthetic conditions which chronic invalidism so often brings in its train, the dam has changed its normalplace. The pain-threshold is abnormally near. The slightest functional exercise gives a distress which the patient yieldsto and stops. In such cases of 'habit-neurosis' a new range of power often comes in consequence of the bullying-treatment, of efforts which the doctor obliges the patient, against his will, to make. First comes the very extremity ofdistress, then follows unexpected relief. There seems no doubt that we are each and all of us to some extent victims ofhabit-neurosis."},{"pageNumber":1296,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1227 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 16]Page 1227We have to admit the wider potential range and the habitually narrow actual use. We live subject to inhibition bydegrees of fatigue which we have come only from habit to obey. Most of us may learn to push the barrier farther off,and to live in perfect comfort on much higher levels of power.Country people and city people, as a class, illustrate this difference. The rapid rate of life, the number of decisions inan hour, the many things to keep account of, in a busy cityman's or woman's life, seem monstrous to a country-brother. He doesn't see how we live at all. But settle him in town; and in a year or two, if not too old, he will havetrained himself to keep the pace as well as any of us, getting more out of himself in any week than he ever did in tenweeks at home. The physiologists show how one can be in nutritive equilibrium, neither losing nor gaining weight, onastonishingly different quantities of food. So one can be in what I might call 'efficiency-equilibrium' (neither gainingnor losing power when once the equilibrium is reached), on astonishingly different quantities of work, no matter inwhat dimension the work may be measured. It may be physical work, intellectual work, moral work, or spiritual work.Of course there are limits: the trees don't grow into the sky. But the plain fact remains that men the world over possessamounts of resource, which only very exceptional individuals push to their extremes of use.The excitements that carry us over the usually effective dam are most often the classic emotional ones, love, anger,crowd-contagion, or despair. Life's vicissitudes bring them in abundance. A new position of responsibility, if it do notcrush a man, will often, nay, one may say, will usually, show him to be a far stronger creature than was supposed.Even here we are witnessing (some of us admiring, some deploring—I must class myself as admiring) thedynamogenic effects of a very exalted political office upon the energies of an individual who had already manifesteda healthy amount of energy before the office came.Mr. Sydney Olivier has given us a fine fable of the dynamogenic effects of love in a fine story called ''The EmpireBuilder,\" in the Contemporary Review for May, 1905.

Cromwell'sand Grant's careers are the stock examples of how war will wake a man up. I owe to Professor Norton's kindness thepermission to read to you part of a letter from Colonel Baird-Smith, written shortly after the six weeks' siege of Delhiin 1857, for the victorious issue of which that excellent officer was chiefly to be thanked. He writes as follows:— \"My poor wife had some reason to think that war and disease between them had left very little of a husband to takeunder nursing when she got him again. An attack of campscurvy had filled my mouth with sores, shaken every joint inmy body, and covered me all over with sores and livid spots so that I was marvellously unlovely to look upon. Asmart knock on the ankle-joint from the splinter of a shell that burst in my face, in itself a mere bagatelle of a wound,had been of necessity neglected under the pressing and incessant calls upon me, and had grown worse and worse tillthe whole foot below the ankle became a black mass and seemed to threaten mortification. I insisted however on beingallowed to use it till the place was taken, mortification or no; and though the pain was sometimes horrible, I carriedmy point and kept up to the last. On the day after the assault I had an unlucky fall on some bad ground, and it was anopen question for a day or two whether I hadn't broken my arm at the elbow. Fortunately it turned out to be only avery severe sprain, but I am still conscious of the wrench it gave me. To crown the whole pleasant catalogue, I wasworn to a shadow by a constant diarrhea, and consumed as much opium as would have done credit to my father-in-law.1 However, thank God I have1Thomas De Quincey."},{"pageNumber":1298,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1229 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 17]Page 1229a good share of Tapleyism in me and come out strong under difficulties. I think I may confidently say that no manever saw me out of heart, or ever heard one croaking word from me even when our prospects were gloomiest.

However, it was done, and after it was done came thecollapse. Don't be horrified when I tell you that for the whole of the actual siege, and in truth for some little timebefore, I almost lived on brandy. Appetite for food I had none, but I forced myself to eat just sufficient to sustain life,and I had an incessant craving for brandy as the strongest stimulant I could get. Strange to say, I was quiteunconscious of its affecting me in the slightest degree. The excitement of the work was so great that no lesser oneseemed to have any chance against it, and I certainly never found my intellect clearer or my nerves stronger in mylife. It was only my wretched body that was weak, and the moment the real work was done by our becoming completemasters of Delhi, I broke down without delay and discovered that if I wished to live I must continue no longer thesystem that had kept me up until the crisis was past. With it passed away as if in a moment all desire to stimulate, anda perfect loathing of my late staff of life took possession of me.\"Such experiences show how profound is the alteration in the manner in which, under excitement, our organism willsometimes perform its physiological work. The metabolisms become different when the reserves have to be used, andfor weeks and months the deeper use may go on.Morbid cases, here as elsewhere, lay the normal machinery bare. In the first number of Dr. Morton Prince's Journal ofAbnormal Psychology, Dr. Janet has discussed five cases of morbid impulse, with an explanation that is precious formy present point of view. One is a girl who eats, eats, eats all day. Another walks, walks, walks, and gets her foodfrom an automobile that escorts her. Another is a dipsomaniac. A fourth pulls out her hair. A fifth wounds her fleshand burns her skin. Hitherto such freaks of impulse have received Greek names (as bulimia, dromomania, etc.) andbeen scientifically disposed of as \"episodic syndromata of hereditary degen-"},{"pageNumber":1299,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1230 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 18]Page 1230eration.\" But it turns out that Janet's cases are all what he calls psychasthenics, or victims of a chronic sense ofweakness, torpor, lethargy, fatigue, insufficiency, impossibility, unreality, and powerlessness of will; and that in eachand all of them the particular activity pursued, deleterious though it be, has the temporary result of raising the sense ofvitality and making the patient feel alive again. These things reanimate; they would reanimate us; but it happens thatin each patient the particular freak-activity chosen is the only thing that does reanimate; and therein lies the morbidstate. The way to treat such persons is to discover to them more usual and useful ways of throwing their stores of vitalenergy into gear.Colonel Baird-Smith, needing to draw on altogether extraordinary stores of energy, found that brandy and opium wereways of throwing them into gear.Such cases are humanly typical. We are all to some degree oppressed, unfree. We don't come to our own. It is there,but we don't get at it. The threshold must be made to shift. Then many of us find that an excentric activity—a 'spree,'say—relieves. There is no doubt that to some men sprees and excesses of almost any kind are medicinal, temporarilyat any rate, in spite of what the moralists and doctors say.But when the normal tasks and stimulations of life don't put a man's deeper levels of energy on tap, and he requiresdistinctly deleterious excitements, his constitution verges on the abnormal. The normal opener of deeper and deeperlevels of energy is the will. The difficulty is to use it; to make the effort which the word volition implies. But if we domake it (or if a god, though he were only the god Chance, makes it through us), it will act dynamogenically on us for amonth. It is notorious that a single successful effort of moral volition, such as saying 'no' to some habitual temptation,or performing some courageous act, will launch a man on a higher level of energy for days and weeks, will give him anew range of power.The emotions and excitements due to usual situations are the usual inciters of the will. But these act discontinuously;and in the intervals the shallower levels of life tend to close in and shut us off. Accordingly the best practical knowersof the human soul have invented the thing known as methodical"},{"pageNumber":1300,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1231 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 18]Page 1231ascetic discipline to keep the deeper levels constantly in reach. Beginning with easy tasks, passing to harder ones, andexercising day by day, it is, I believe, admitted that disciples of asceticism can reach very high levels of freedom andpower of will.Ignatius Loyola's spiritual exercises must have produced this result in innumerable devotees. But the most venerableascetic system, and the one whose results have the most voluminous experimental corroboration, is undoubtedly theYoga system in Hindostan. From time immemorial, by Hatha Yoga, Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, or whatever code ofpractice it might be, Hindu aspirants to perfection have trained themselves, month in and out, for years. The resultclaimed, and certainly in many cases accorded by impartial judges, is strength of character, personal power,unshakability of soul. But it is not easy to disentangle fact from tradition in Hindu affairs. So I am glad to have aEuropean friend who has submitted to Hatha Yoga training, and whose account of the results I am privileged to quote.I think you will appreciate the light it throws on the question of our unused reservoirs of power.My friend is an extraordinarily gifted man, both morally and intellectually, but has an instable nervous system, andfor many years has lived in a circular process of alternate lethargy and over-animation: something like three weeks ofextreme activity, and then a week of prostration in bed. An unpromising condition, which the best specialists inEurope had failed to relieve; so he tried Hatha Yoga, partly out of curiosity, and partly with a sort of desperate hope.What follows is a short extract from a letter sixty pages long which he addressed me a year ago.\"Thus I decided to follow Vivekananda's advice: 'Practice hard: whether you live or die by it doesn't matter.' Myimprovised chela and I began with starvation. I do not know whether you did try it ever but voluntary starvation isvery different from involuntary, and implies more temptations. We reduced first our meals to twice a day and then toonce a day. The best authorities agree that in order to control the body fasting is essential, and even in the Gospel theworst spirits are said to obey only those who fast and pray. We"},{"pageNumber":1301,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1232 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 18]Page 1232reduced very much the amount of food, disregarding chemical theories about the need of albumen, sometimes livingon olive oil and bread; or on fruits alone; or on milk and rice; in very small quantities—much less than I formerly ateat one meal. I began to get lighter every day, and lost 20 pounds in a few weeks; but this could not stop such adesperate undertaking rather starve than live as a slave! Then besides we practised asana or postures, breakingalmost our limbs. Try to sit down on the floor and to kiss your knees without bending them, or to join your hands onthe usually unapproachable upper part of your back, or to bring the toe of your right foot to your left ear withoutbending the knees these are easy samples of posture for a Yogi.\"All the time also breathing exercises: keeping the breath in and out up to two minutes, breathing in different rhythmsand positions. Also very much prayer and Roman Catholic practices combined with the Yoga, in order to leavenothing untried and to be protected against the tricks of Hindu devils! Then concentration of thought on different partsof the body, and on the processes going on within them. Exclusion of all emotions, dry logical reading, as intellectualdiet, and working out logical problems I wrote a Handbook of Logic as a Nebenprodukt of the whole experiment.1\"After a few weeks I broke down and had to interrupt everything, in a worse state of prostration than ever Myyounger chela went on unshaken by my fate; and as soon as I arose from bed I tried again, decided to fight it out,even feeling a kind of determination such as I had never felt before, a certain absolute will of victory at any price andfaith in it. Whether it is my own merit or a divine grace, I cannot judge for certain, but I prefer to admit the latter. Ihad been ill for seven years, and some people say this is a term for many punishments. However base and vile asinner I had been, perhaps my sins were about to be forgiven, and Yoga was only an exterior opportunity, an objectfor concentration of will. I do not yet pretend to explain much of what I have gone through, but the fact is that since Iarose from bed on August 20, no new crisis of prostration came again, and I have now the1This handbook was published last March."},{"pageNumber":1302,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1233 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 19]Page 1233strongest conviction that no crisis will ever return. If you consider that for the past years there has been not a singlemonth without this lethargy, you will grant that even to an outside observer four successive months of increasinghealth are an objective test. In this time I underwent very severe penances, reducing sleep and food and increasing thetask of work and exercise. My intuition was developed by these practices: there came a sense of certainty, neverknown before, as to the things needed by the body and the mind, and the body came to obey like a wild horse tamed.Also the mind learned to obey, and the current of thought and feeling was shaped according to my will. I masteredsleep and hunger, and the flights of thought, and came to know a peace never known before, an inner rhythm ofunison with a deeper rhythm above or beyond. Personal wishes ceased, and the consciousness of being the instrumentof a superior power arose. A calm certainty of indubitable success in every undertaking imparts great and real power. Ioften guessed the thoughts of my companion we observed generally the greatest isolation and silence. We both feltan unspeakable joy in the simplest natural impressions, light, air, landscape, any kind of simplest food; and aboveeverything in rhythmical respiration, which produces a state of mind without thought or feeling, and still very intense,indescribable.\"These results began to be more evident in the fourth month of uninterrupted training. We felt quite happy, nevertired, sleeping only from 8 P. M. to midnight, and rising with joy from our sleep to another day's work of study andexercise. \"I am now in Palermo, and have had to neglect the exercises in the last few days, but I feel as fresh as if I were in fulltraining and see the sunny side of all things. I am not in a hurry, rushing to complete—.\"And here my friend mentions a certain life-work of his own about which I had better be silent. He goes on to analyzethe exercises and their effects in an extremely practical way, but at too great length for me to entertain you with.Repetition, alteration, periodicity, parallelism (or the association of the idea of some desirable vital or spiritual effectwith each movement), etc., are laws which he deems highly important. \"I am"},{"pageNumber":1303,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1234 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 20]Page 1234sure,\" he continues, \"that everybody who is able to concentrate thought and will, and to eliminate superfluousemotions, sooner or later becomes a master of his body and can overcome every kind of illness. This is the truth at thebottom of all mind-cures. Our thoughts have a plastic power over the body.\"You will be relieved, I doubt not, to hear my excentric correspondent here make connection at last with somethingyou know by heart, namely, \"suggestive therapeutics.\" Call his whole performance, if you like, an experiment inmethodical self-suggestion. That only makes it more valuable as an illustration of what I wish to impress in as manyways as possible upon your minds, that we habitually live inside our limits of power. Suggestion, especially underhypnosis, is now universally recognized as a means, exceptionally successful in certain persons, of concentratingconsciousness, and, in others, of influencing their body's states. It throws into gear energies of imagination, of will,and of mental influence over physiological processes, that usually lie dormant, and that can only be thrown into gearat all in chosen subjects. It is, in short, dynamogenic; and the cheapest terms in which to deal with our amateur Yogi'sexperience is to call it auto-suggestive.I wrote to him that I couldn't possibly attribute any sacramental value to the particular Hatha Yoga processes, thepostures, breathings, fastings, and the like, and that they seemed to me but so many manners, available in his case andhis chela's, but not for everybody, of breaking through the barriers which life's routine had concreted round the deeperstrata of the will, and gradually bringing its unused energies into action.He replied as follows: \"You are quite right that the Yoga exercises are nothing else than a methodical way ofincreasing our will. Because we are unable to will at once the most difficult things, we must imagine steps leading tothem. Breathing being the easiest of the bodily activities, it is very natural that it offers a good scope for exercise ofwill. The control of thought could be gained without breathing-discipline, but it is simply easier to control thoughtsimultaneously with the control of breath. Anyone who can think clearly and persistently of one thing needs notbreathing exercises. You are quite right that we are not using all our power and that we"},{"pageNumber":1304,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1235 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 20]Page 1235often learn how much we can only when we must. The power that we do not use up completely can be brought [moreand more] into use by what we call faith. Faith is like the manometer of the will, registering its pressure. If I couldbelieve that I can levitate, I could do it. But I cannot believe, and therefore I am clumsily sticking to earth Now thisfaith, this power of credulity, can be educated by small efforts. I can breathe at the rate of say twelve times a minute. Ican easily believe that I can breathe ten times a minute. When I have accustomed myself to breathe ten times aminute, I learn to believe it will be easy to breathe six times a minute. Thus I have actually learned to breathe at therate of once a minute. How far I shall progress I do not know. The Yogi goes on in his activity in an even way,without fits of too much or too little, and he is eliminating more and more every unrest, every worry—growing intothe infinite by regular training, by small additions to a task which has grown familiar. But you are quite right thatreligious crises, love-crises, indignation-crises, may awaken in a very short time powers similar to those reached byyears of patient Yoga practice. The Hindus themselves admit that Samadhi can be reached in many ways and withcomplete disregard of every physical training.\"Allowance made for every enthusiasm and exaggeration, there can be no doubt of my friend's regeneration—relatively, at any rate. The second letter, written six months later than the first (ten months after beginning Yogapractice, therefore), says the improvement holds good. He has undergone material trials with indifference, travelledthird class on Mediterranean steamers, and fourth class on African trains, living with the poorest Arabs and sharingtheir unaccustomed food, all with equanimity. His devotion to certain interests has been put to heavy strain, andnothing is more remarkable to me than the changed moral tone with which he reports the situation. Compared withcertain earlier letters, these read as if written by a different man, patient and reasonable instead of vehement, self-subordinating instead of imperious. The new tone persists in a communication received only a fortnight ago (fourteenmonths after beginning training)—there is, in fact, no doubt that profound modification has occurred in the"},{"pageNumber":1305,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1236 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 21]Page 1236running of his mental machinery. The gearing has changed, and his will is available otherwise than it was. Availablewithout any new ideas, beliefs, or emotions, so far as I can make out, having been implanted in him. He is simplymore balanced where he was more unbalanced.You will remember that he speaks of faith, calling it a 'manometer' of the will. It sounds more natural to call our willthe manometer of our faiths. Ideas set free beliefs, and the beliefs set free our wills (I use these terms with nopretension to be 'psychological'), so the will-acts register the faith-pressure within. Therefore, having considered theliberation of our stored-up energy by emotional excitements and by efforts, whether methodical or unmethodical, Imust now say a word about ideas as our third great dynamogenic agent. Ideas contradict other ideas and keep us frombelieving them. An idea that thus negates a first idea may itself in turn be negated by a third idea, and the first ideamay thus regain its natural influence over our belief and determine our behavior. Our philosophic and religiousdevelopment proceeds thus by credulities, negations, and the negating of negations.But whether for arousing or for stopping belief, ideas may fail to be efficacious, just as a wire at one time alive withelectricity, may at another time be dead. Here our insight into causes fails us, and we can only note results in generalterms. In general, whether a given idea shall be a live idea, depends more on the person into whose mind it is injectedthan on the idea itself. The whole history of 'suggestion' opens out here. Which are the suggestive ideas for thisperson, and which for that? Beside the susceptibilities determined by one's education and by one's originalpeculiarities of character, there are lines along which men simply as men tend to be inflammable by ideas. As certainobjects naturally awaken love, anger, or cupidity, so certain ideas naturally awaken the energies of loyalty, courage,endurance, or devotion. When these ideas are effective in an individual's life, their effect is often very great indeed.They may transfigure it, unlocking innumerable powers which, but for the idea, would never have come into play.'Fatherland,' 'The Union,' 'Holy Church,' the 'Monroe Doctrine,' 'Truth,' 'Science,' 'Liberty,'"},{"pageNumber":1306,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1237 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 22]Page 1237Garibaldi's phrase 'Rome or Death,', etc., are so many examples of energy-releasing abstract ideas. The social natureof all such phrases is an essential factor of their dynamic power. They are forces of detent in situations in which noother force produces equivalent effects, and each is a force of detent only in a specific group of men.The memory that an oath or vow has been made will nerve one to abstinences and efforts otherwise impossible:witness the 'pledge' in the history of the temperance movement. A mere promise to his sweetheart will clean up ayouth's life all over—at any rate for a time. For such effects an educated susceptibility is required. The idea of one's'honour,' for example, unlocks energy only in those who have had the education of a gentleman, so called.That delightful being, Prince Pueckler-Muskau, writes to his wife from England that he has invented ''a sort ofartificial resolution respecting things that are difficult of performance.\" \"My device,\" he says, \"is this: I give my wordof honour most solemnly to myself to do or to leave undone this or that. I am of course extremly cautious in the useof this expedient, but when once the word is given, even though I afterwards think I have been precipitate ormistaken, I hold it to be perfectly irrevocable, whatever inconveniences I foresee likely to result. If I were capable ofbreaking my word after such mature consideration, I should lose all respect for myself—and what man of sense wouldnot prefer death to such an alternative? When the mysterious formula is pronounced, no alteration in my own views,nothing short of physical impossibility, must, for the welfare of my soul, alter my will. I find something verysatisfactory in the thought that man has the power of framing such props and weapons out of the most trivialmaterials, indeed out of nothing, merely by the force of his will, which thereby truly deserves the name ofomnipotent.\"1Conversions, whether they be political, scientific, philosophic, or religious, form another way in which bound energiesare let loose. They unify, and put a stop to ancient mental1Tour in England, Ireland, and France, Philadelphia, 1833, p. 435."},{"pageNumber":1307,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1238 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 22]Page 1238interferences. The result is freedom, and often a great enlargement of power. A belief that thus settles upon anindividual always acts as a challenge to his will. But, for the particular challenge to operate, he must be the rightchallengee. In religious conversions we have so fine an adjustment that the idea may be in the mind of the challengeefor years before it exerts effects; and why it should do so then is often so far from obvious that the event is taken for amiracle of grace, and not a natural occurrence. Whatever it is, it may be a highwater mark of energy, in which 'noes,'once impossible, are easy, and in which a new range of 'yeses' gain the right of way.We are just now witnessing—but our scientific education has unfitted most of us for comprehending the phenomenon—a very copious unlocking of energies by ideas, in the persons of those converts to 'New Thought,' 'ChristianScience,' 'Metaphysical Healing,' or other forms of spiritual philosophy, who are so numerous among us to-day. Theideas here are healthy-minded and optimistic; and it is quite obvious that a wave of religious activity, analogous insome respects to the spread of early Christianity, Buddhism, and Mohammedanism is passing over our Americanworld. The common feature of these optimistic faiths is that they all tend to the suppression of what Mr. HoraceFletcher calls \"fear thought.\" Fear thought he defines as \"the self-suggestion of inferiority\"; so that one may say thatthese systems all operate by the suggestion of power. And the power, small or great, comes in various shapes to theindividual, power, as he will tell you, not to 'mind' things that used to vex him, power to concentrate his mind, goodcheer, good temper, in short, to put it mildly, a firmer, more elastic moral tone. The most genuinely saintly person Ihave ever known is a friend of mine now suffering from cancer of the breast. I do not assume to judge of the wisdomor unwisdom of her disobedience to the doctors, and I cite her here solely as an example of what ideas can do. Herideas have kept her a practically well woman for months after she should have given up and gone to bed. They haveannulled all pain and weakness and given her a cheerful active life, unusually beneficent to others to whom she hasafforded help.How far the mind-cure movement is destined to extend its"},{"pageNumber":1308,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1239 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 23]Page 1239influence, or what intellectual modifications it may yet undergo, no one can foretell. Being a religious movement, itwill certainly outstrip the previsions of its rationalist critics, such as we here may be supposed to be.I have thus brought a pretty wide induction to bear upon my thesis, and it appears to hold good. The human individuallives usually far within his limits; he possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use. He energizesbelow his maximum, and he behaves below his optimum. In elementary faculty, in coördination, in power ofinhibition and control, in every conceivable way, his life is contracted like the field of vision of an hysteric subject—but with less excuse, for the poor hysteric is diseased, while in the rest of us it is only an inveterate habit—the habitof inferiority to our full self—that is bad.Expressed in this vague manner, everyone must admit my thesis to be true. The terms have to remain vague; forthough every man of woman born knows what is meant by such phrases as having a good vital tone, a high tide ofspirits, an elastic temper, as living energetically, working easily, deciding firmly, and the like, we should all be put toour trumps if asked to explain in terms of scientific psychology just what such expressions mean. We can draw somechild-like psycho-physical diagrams, and that is all. In physics the conception of 'energy' is perfectly defined. It iscorrelated with the conception of 'work.' But mental work and moral work, although we cannot live without talkingabout them, are terms as yet hardly analyzed, and doubtless mean several heterogeneous elementary things. Ourmuscular work is a voluminous physical quantity, but our ideas and volitions are minute forces of release, and by'work' here we mean the substitution of higher kinds for lower kinds of detent. Higher and lower here are qualitativeterms, not translatable immediately into quantities, unless indeed they should prove to mean newer or older forms ofcerebral organization, and unless newer should then prove to mean cortically more superficial, older, cortically moredeep. Some anatomists, as you know, have pretended this; but it is obvious that the intuitive or popular idea"},{"pageNumber":1309,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1240 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 24]Page 1240of mental work, fundamental and abolutely indispensable as it is in our lives, possesses no degree whatever ofscientific clearness to-day.Here, then, is the first problem that emerges from our study. Can any one of us refine upon the conceptions of mentalwork and mental energy, so as later to be able to throw some definitely analytic light on what we mean by 'having amore elastic moral tone,' or by 'using higher levels of power and will'? I imagine that we may have to wait long beforeprogress in this direction is made. The problem is too homely; one doesn't see just how to get in the electric keys andrevolving drums that alone make psychology scientific today.My fellow-pragmatist in Florence, G. Papini, has adopted a new conception of philosophy. He calls it the doctrine ofaction in the widest sense, the study of all human powers and means (among which latter, truths of every kindwhatsoever figure, of course, in the first rank). From this point of view philosophy is a Pragmatic, comprehending, astributary departments of itself, the old disciplines of logic, metaphysic, physic, and ethic.And here, after our first problem, two other problems burst upon our view. My belief that these two problems form aprogram of work well worthy of the attention of a body as learned and earnest as this audience, is, in fact, what hasdetermined me to choose this subject, and to drag you through so many familiar facts during the hour that has sped.The first of the two problems is that of our powers, the second that of our means. We ought somehow to get atopographic survey made of the limits of human power in every conceivable direction, something like anophthalmologist's chart of the limits of the human field of vision; and we ought then to construct a methodicalinventory of the paths of access, or keys, differing with the diverse types of individual, to the different kinds of power.This would be an absolutely concrete study, to be carried on by using historical and biographical material mainly. Thelimits of power must be limits that have been realized in actual persons, and the various ways of unlocking thereserves of power must have been ex-"},{"pageNumber":1310,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1241 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 24]Page 1241emplified in individual lives. Laboratory experimentation can play but a small part. Your psychologist's Versuchsthier,outside of hypnosis, can never be called on to tax his energies in ways as extreme as those which the emergencies oflife will force on him.So here is a program of concrete individual psychology, at which anyone in some measure may work. It is repletewith interesting facts, and points to practical issues superior in importance to anything we know. I urge it thereforeupon your consideration. In some shape we have all worked at it in a more or less blind and fragmentary way; yetbefore Papini mentioned it I had never thought of it, or heard it broached by anyone, in the generalized form of aprogram such as I now suggest, a program that might with proper care be made to cover the whole field ofpsychology, and might show us parts of it in a very fresh light.It is just the generalizing of the problem that seems to me to make so strong an appeal. I hope that in some of you theconception may unlock unused reservoirs of investigating power.The Philosophical Review, January 1907"},{"pageNumber":1311,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1242 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 25]Page 1242The Social Value of the College-BredAN ADDRESS MADE AT A MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATIONOF AMERICAN ALUMNAE AT RADCLIFFE COLLEGE,NOVEMBER 7, 1907Of what use is a college training? We who have had it seldom hear the question raised—we might be a littlenonplussed to answer it offhand. A certain amount of meditation has brought me to this as the pithiest reply which Imyself can give: The best claim that a college education can possibly make on your respect, the best thing it canaspire to accomplish for you, is this: that it should help you to know a good man when you see him. This is as true ofwomen's as of men's colleges; but that it is neither a joke nor a one-sided abstraction I shall now endeavor to show.What talk do we commonly hear about the contrast between college education and the education which business ortechnical or professional schools confer? The college education is called higher because it is supposed to be so generaland so disinterested. At the \"schools\" you get a relatively narrow practical skill, you are told, whereas the \"colleges\"give you the more liberal culture, the broader outlook, the historical perspective, the philosophic atmosphere, orsomething which phrases of that sort try to express. You are made into an efficient instrument for doing a definitething, you hear, at the schools; but, apart from that, you may remain a crude and smoky kind of petroleum, incapableof spreading light. The universities and colleges, on the other hand, although they may leave you less efficient for thisor that practical task, suffuse your whole mentality with something more important than skill. They redeem you, makeyou well-bred; they make \"good company'' of you mentally. If they find you with a naturally boorish or caddish mind,they cannot leave you so, as a technical school may leave you. This, at least, is pretended; this is what we hear amongcollege-trained people when they compare their education with every other sort. Now, exactly how much does thissignify?It is certain, to begin with, that the narrowest trade or"},{"pageNumber":1312,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1243 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 26]Page 1243professional training does something more for a man than to make a skilful practical tool of him—it makes him also ajudge of other men's skill. Whether his trade be pleading at the bar or surgery or plastering or plumbing, it develops acritical sense in him for that sort of occupation. He understands the difference between second-rate and first-rate workin his whole branch of industry; he gets to know a good job in his own line as soon as he sees it; and getting to knowthis in his own line, he gets a faint sense of what good work may mean anyhow, that may, if circumstances favor,spread into his judgments elsewhere. Sound work, clean work, finished work: feeble work, slack work, sham work—these words express an identical contrast in many different departments of activity. In so far forth, then, even thehumblest manual trade may beget in one a certain small degree of power to judge of good work generally.Now, what is supposed to be the line of us who have the higher college training? Is there any broader line—since oureducation claims primarily not to be \"narrow\"—in which we also are made good judges between what is first-rate andwhat is second-rate only? What is especially taught in the colleges has long been known by the name of the\"humanities,\" and these are often identified with Greek and Latin. But it is only as literatures, not as languages, thatGreek and Latin have any general humanity-value; so that in a broad sense the humanities mean literature primarily,and in a still broader sense the study of masterpieces in almost any field of human endeavor. Literature keeps theprimacy; for it not only consists of masterpieces, but is largely about masterpieces, being little more than anappreciative chronicle of human master-strokes, so far as it takes the form of criticism and history. You can givehumanistic value to almost anything by teaching it historically. Geology, economics, mechanics, are humanities whentaught with reference to the successive achievements of the geniuses to which these sciences owe their being. Nottaught thus, literature remains grammer, art a catalogue, history a list of dates, and natural science a sheet of formulasand weights and measures.The sifting of human creations!—nothing less than this is what we ought to mean by the humanities.

Studying in thisway, we learn what types of activity have stood the test of time; we acquire standards of the excellent and durable. Allour arts and sciences and institutions are but so many quests of perfection on the part of men; and when we see howdiverse the types of excellence may be, how various the tests, how flexible the adaptations, we gain a richer sense ofwhat the terms \"better\" and \"worse\" may signify in general. Our critical sensibilities grow both more acute and lessfanatical. We sympathize with men's mistakes even in the act of penetrating them; we feel the pathos of lost causesand misguided epochs even while we applaud what overcame them.Such words are vague and such ideas are inadequate, but their meaning is unmistakable. What the colleges—teachinghumanities by examples which may be special, but which must be typical and pregnant—should at least try to give us,is a general sense of what, under various disguises, superiority has always signified and may still signify. The feelingfor a good human job anywhere, the admiration of the really admirable, the disesteem of what is cheap and trashy andimpermanent—this is what we call the critical sense, the sense for ideal values. It is the better part of what men knowas wisdom. Some of use are wise in this way naturally and by genius; some of us never become so. But to have spentone's youth at college, in contact with the choice and rare and precious, and yet still to be a blind prig or vulgarian,unable to scent out human excellence or to divine it amid its accidents, to know it only when ticketed and labeled andforced on us by others, this indeed should be accounted the very calamity and shipwreck of a higher education.The sense for human superiority ought, then, to be considered our line, as boring subways is the engineer's line andthe surgeon's is appendicitis. Our colleges ought to have lit up in us a lasting relish for the better kind of man, a lossof appetite for mediocrities, and a disgust for cheapjacks. We ought to smell, as it were, the difference of quality inmen and their proposals when we enter the world of affairs about us.

Thebest claim we can make for the higher education, the best single phrase in which we can tell what it ought to do forus, is, then, exactly what I said: it should enable us to know a good man when we see him.That the phrase is anything but an empty epigram follows from the fact that if you ask in what line it is most importantthat a democracy like ours should have its sons and daughters skilful, you see that it is this line more than any other.\"The people in their wisdom\" —this is the kind of wisdom most needed by the people. Democracy is on its trial, andno one knows how it will stand the ordeal. Abounding about us are pessimistic prophets. Fickleness and violence usedto be, but are no longer, the vices which they charge to democracy. What its critics now affirm is that its preferencesare inveterately for the inferior. So it was in the beginning, they say, and so it will be world without end. Vulgarityenthroned and institutionalized, elbowing everything superior from the highway, this, they tell us, is our irremediabledestiny; and the picture-papers of the European continent are already drawing Uncle Sam with the hog instead of theeagle for his heraldic emblem. The privileged aristocracies of the foretime, with all their iniquities, did at leastpreserve some taste for higher human quality and honor certain forms of refinement by their enduring traditions. Butwhen democracy is sovereign, its doubters say, nobility will form a soft of invisible church, and sincerity andrefinement, stripped of honor, precedence, and favor, will have to vegetate on sufferance in private corners. They willhave no general influence. They will be harmless eccentricities.Now, who can be absolutely certain that this may not be the career of democracy? Nothing future is quite secure;states enough have inwardly rotted; and democracy as a whole may undergo self-poisoning. But, on the other hand,democracy is a kind of religion, and we are bound not to admit its failure. Faiths and utopias are the noblest exerciseof human reason, and no one with a spark of reason in him will sit down fatalistically before the croaker's picture.

Our better men shallshow the way and we shall follow them; so we are brought round again to the mission of the higher education inhelping us to know the better kind of man whenever we see him.The notion that a people can run itself and its affairs anonymously is now well known to be the silliest of absurdities.Mankind does nothing save through initiatives on the part of inventors, great or small, and imitation by the rest of us—these are the sole factors active in human progress. Individuals of genius show the way, and set the patterns, whichcommon people then adopt and follow. The rivalry of the patterns is the history of the world. Our democratic problemthus is stable in ultra-simple terms: Who are the kind of men from whom our majorities shall take their cue? Whomshall they treat as rightful leaders? We and our leaders are the x and the y of the equation here; all other historiccircumstances, be they economical, political, or intellectual, are only the background of occasion on which the livingdrama works itself out between us.In this very simple way does the value of our educated class define itself: we more than others should be able todivine the worthier and better leaders. The terms here are monstrously simplified, of course, but such a bird's-eyeview lets us immediately take our bearings. In our democracy, where everything else is so shifting, we alumni andalumnae of the colleges are the only permanent presence that corresponds to the aristocracy in older countries. Wehave continuous traditions, as they have; our motto, too, is noblesse oblige; and, unlike them, we stand for idealinterests solely, for we have no corporate selfishness and wield no powers of corruption. We ought to have our ownclass-consciousness. \"Less intellectuals\"! What producer club-name could there be than this one, used ironically bythe party of \"red blood,\" the party of every stupid prejudice and passion, during the anti-Dreyfus craze, to satirize themen in France who still retained some critical sense and judgment!

But the affections,passions, and interests are shifting, successive, and distraught; they blow in alternation while the pilot's hand issteadfast. He knows the compass, and, with all the leeways he is obliged to tack toward, he always makes someheadway. A small force, if it never lets up, will accumulate effects more considerable than those of much greaterforces if these work inconsistently. The ceaseless whisper of the more permanent ideals, the steady tug of truth andjustice, give them but time, must warp the world in their direction.This bird's-eye view of the general steering function of the college-bred amid the driftings of democracy ought tohelp us to a wider vision of what our colleges themselves should aim at. If we are to be the yeast-cake fordemocracy's dough, if we are to make it rise with culture's preferences, we must see to it that culture spreads broadsails. We must shake the old double reefs out of the canvas into the wind and sunshine, and let in every modernsubject, sure that any subject will prove humanistic, if its setting be kept only wide enough.Stevenson says somewhere to his reader: \"You think you are just making this bargain, but you are really laying downa link in the policy of mankind.\" Well, your technical school should enable you to make your bargain splendidly; butyour college should show you just the place of that kind of bargain—a pretty poor place, possibly—in the wholepolicy of mankind. That is the kind of liberal outlook, of perspective, of atmosphere, which should surround everysubject as a college deals with it.We of the colleges must eradicate a curious notion which numbers of good people have about such ancient seats oflearning as Harvard. To many ignorant outsiders, that name suggests little more than a kind of sterilized conceit andincapacity for being pleased. In Edith Wyatt's exquisite book of Chicago sketches called \"Every One his Own Way\"there is a couple who stand for culture in the sense of exclusiveness, Richard Elliot and his feminine counterpart—feeble caricatures of mankind, unable to know any good thing when they see it, incapable of enjoyment unless aprinted label gives"},{"pageNumber":1317,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1248 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 29]Page 1248them leave. Possibly this type of culture may exist near Cambridge and Boston, there may be specimens there, forpriggishness is just like painter's colic or any other trade-disease. But every good college makes its students immuneagainst this malady, of which the microbe haunts the neighborhood- printed pages. It does so by its general tone beingtoo hearty for the microbe's life. Real culture lives by sympathies and admirations, not by dislikes and disdains—under all misleading wrappings it pounces unerringly upon the human core. If a college, through the inferior humaninfluences that have grown regnant there, fails to catch the robuster tone, its failure is colossal, for its social functionstops: democracy gives it a wide berth, turns toward it a deaf ear.\"Tone,\" to be sure, is a terribly vague word to use, but there is no other, and this whole meditation is over questions oftone. By their tone are all things human either lost or saved. If democracy is to be saved it must catch the higher,healthier tone. If we are to impress it with our preferences, we ourselves must use the proper tone, which we, in turn,must have caught from our own teachers. It all reverts in the end to the action of innumerable imitative individualsupon each other and to the question of whose tone has the highest spreading power. As a class, we college graduatesshould look to it that ours has spreading power. It ought to have the highest spreading power.In our essential function of indicating the better men, we now have formidable competitors outside. McClure'sMagazine, the American Magazine, Collier's Weekly, and, in its fashion, the World's Work, constitute together a realpopular university along this very line. It would be a pity if any future historian were to have to write words likethese: \"By the middle of the twentieth century the higher institutions of learning had lost all influence over publicopinion in the United States. But the mission of raising the tone of democracy, which they had proved themselves solamentably unfitted to exert, was assumed with rare enthusiasm and prosecuted with extraordinary skill and success bya new educational power; and for the clarification of their human sympathies and elevation of their humanpreferences, the people at large acquired the habit of resorting exclusively to the guidance of certain"},{"pageNumber":1318,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1249 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 29]Page 1249private literary adventures, commonly designated in the market by the affectionate name of ten-cent magazines.\"Must not we of the colleges see to it that no historian shall ever say anything like this? Vague as the phrase ofknowing a good man when you see him may be, diffuse and indefinite as one must leave its application, is there anyother formula that describes so well the result at which our institutions ought to aim? If they do that, they do the bestthing conceivable. If they fail to do it, they fail in very deed. It surely is a fine synthetic formula. If our faculties andgraduates could once collectively come to realize it as the great underlying purpose toward which they have alwaysbeen more or less obscurely groping, a great clearness would be shed over many of their problems; and, as for theirinfluence in the midst of our social system, it would embark upon a new career of strength.McClure's Magazine, February 1908"},{"pageNumber":1319,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1250 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 30]Page 1250The Confidences of a \"Psychical Researcher\"The late Professor Henry Sidgwick was celebrated for the rare mixture of ardor and critical judgment which hischaracter exhibited. The liberal heart which he possessed had to work with an intellect which acted destructively onalmost every particular object of belief that was offered to its acceptance. A quarter of a century ago, scandalized bythe chaotic state of opinion regarding the phenomena now called by the rather ridiculous name of \"psychic\"—phenomena of which the supply reported seems inexhaustible, but which scientifically trained minds mostly refuse tolook at—he established, along with Professor Barrett, Frederic Myers and Edmund Gurney, the Society for PsychicalResearch. These men hoped that if the material were treated rigorously and, as far as possible, experimentally,objective truth would be elicited, and the subject rescued from sentimentalism on the one side and dogmatizingignorance on the other. Like all founders, Sidgwick hoped for a certain promptitude of result; and I heard him say, theyear before his death, that if anyone had told him at the outset that after twenty years he would be in the sameidentical state of doubt and balance that he started with, he would have deemed the prophecy incredible. It appearedimpossible that that amount of handling evidence should bring so little finality of decision.My own experience has been similar to Sidgwick's. For twenty-five years I have been in touch with the literature ofpsychical research, and have had acquaintance with numerous \"researchers.\" I have also spent a good many hours(though far fewer than I ought to have spent) in witnessing (or trying to witness) phenomena. Yet I am theoreticallyno \"further\" than I was at the beginning; and I confess that at times I have been tempted to believe that the Creator haseternally intended this department of nature to remain baffling, to prompt our curiosities and hopes and suspicions allin equal measure, so that, although ghosts and clairvoyances, and raps and messages from spirits, are always seemingto exist and can never be fully explained away, they also can never be susceptible of full corroboration."},{"pageNumber":1320,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1251 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 30]Page 1251The peculiarity of the case is just that there are so many sources of possible deception in most of the observations thatthe whole lot of them may be worthless, and yet that in comparatively few cases can aught more fatal than this vaguegeneral possibility of error be pleaded against the record. Science meanwhile needs something more than barepossibilities to build upon; so your genuinely scientific inquirer—I don't mean your ignoramus \"scientist\"—has toremain unsatisfied. It is hard to believe, however, that the Creator has really put any big array of phenomena into theworld merely to defy and mock our scientific tendencies; so my deeper belief is that we psychical researchers havebeen too precipitate with our hopes, and that we must expect to mark progress not by quarter-centuries, but by half-centuries or whole centuries.I am strengthened in this belief by my impression that just at this moment a faint but distinct step forward is beingtaken by competent opinion in these matters. \"Physical phenomena\" (movements of matter without contact, lights,hands and faces \"materialized,\" etc.) have been one of the most baffling regions of the general field (or perhaps oneof the least baffling prima facie, so certain and great has been the part played by fraud in their production); yet evenhere the balance of testimony seems slowly to be inclining towards admitting the supernaturalist view. EusapiaPaladino, the Neapolitan medium, has been under observation for twenty years or more. Schiaparelli, the astronomer,and Lombroso were the first scientific men to be converted by her performances. Since then innumerable men ofscientific standing have seen her, including many \"psychic\" experts. Every one agrees that she cheats in the mostbarefaced manner whenever she gets an opportunity. The Cambridge experts, with the Sidgwicks and RichardHodgson at their head, rejected her in toto on that account. Yet her credit has steadily risen, and now her last convertsare the eminent psychiatrist, Morselli, the eminent physiologist, Botazzi, and our own psychical researcher,Carrington, whose book on \"The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism'' (against them rather!) makes his conqueststrategically important. If Mr. Podmore, hitherto the prosecuting attorney of the S. P. R. so far as physical phenomenaare concerned, becomes converted also, we may indeed sit up and look around us."},{"pageNumber":1321,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1252 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 31]Page 1252Getting a good health bill from \"Science,\" Eusapia will then throw retrospective credit on Home and Stainton Moses,Florence Cook (Prof. Crookes's medium), and all similar wonder-workers. The balance of presumptions will bechanged in favor of genuineness being possible at least, in all reports of this particularly crass and low type ofsupernatural phenomenon.Not long after Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" appeared I was studying with that excellent anatomist and man, JeffriesWyman, at Harvard. He was a convert, yet so far a half- hesitating one, to Darwin's views; but I heard him make aremark that applies well to the subject I now write about. When, he said, a theory gets propounded over and overagain, coming up afresh after each time orthodox criticism has buried it, and each time seeming solider and harder toabolish, you may be sure that there is truth in it. Oken and Lamarck and Chambers had been triumphantly despatchedand buried, but here was Darwin making the very same heresy seem only more plausible. How often has \"Science\"killed off all spook philosophy, and laid ghosts and raps and \"telepathy\" away underground as so much populardelusion. Yet never before were these things offered us so voluminously, and never in such authentic-seeming shapeor with such good credentials. The tide seems steadily to be rising, in spite of all the expedients of scientificorthodoxy. It is hard not to suspect that here may be something different from a mere chapter in human gullibility. Itmay be a genuine realm of natural phenomena.Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, once a cheat, always a cheat, such has been the motto of the English psychicalresearchers in dealing with mediums. I am disposed to think that, as a matter of policy, it has been wise. Tactically itis far better to believe much too little than a little too much; and the exceptional credit attaching to the row of volumesof the S. P. R.'s Proceedings, is due to the fixed intention of the editors to proceed very slowly.

In most things human the accusation of deliberate fraud and falsehood is grossly superficial. Man's character istoo sophistically mixed for the alternative of \"honest or dishonest\" to be a sharp one. Scientific men themselves willcheat—at public lectures—rather than let experiments obey their well-known tendency towards failure. I have heardof a lecturer on physics, who had taken over the apparatus of the previous incumbent, consulting him about a certainmachine intended to show that, however the peripheral parts of it might be agitated, its center of gravity remainedimmovable. \"It will wobble,\" he complained. \"Well,\" said the predecessor, apologetically, \"to tell the truth, whenever Iused that machine I found it advisable to drive a nail through the center of gravity.\" I once saw a distinguishedphysiologist, now dead, cheat most shamelessly at a public lecture, at the expense of a poor rabbit, and all for the sakeof being able to make a cheap joke about its being an ''American rabbit\"—for no other, he said, could survive such awound as he pretended to have given it.To compare small men with great, I have myself cheated shamelessly. In the early days of the Sanders Theater atHarvard, I once had charge of a heart on the physiology of which Prof. Newell Martin was giving a popular lecture.This heart, which belonged to a turtle, supported an index-straw which threw a moving shadow, greatly enlarged,upon the screen, while the heart pulsated. When certain nerves were stimulated, the lecturer said, the heart would actin certain ways which he described. But the poor heart was too far gone and, although it stopped duly when the nerveof arrest was excited, that was the final end of its life's tether. Presiding over the performance, I was terrified at thefiasco, and found myself suddenly acting like one of those military geniuses who on the field of battle convert disasterinto victory. There was no time for deliberation; so, with my forefinger under a part of the straw that cast no shadow, Ifound myself impulsively and automatically imitating the rhythmical movements which my colleague had prophesiedthe heart would undergo. I kept the experiment from failing; and not only saved my colleague (and the turtle) from ahumiliation that but for my presence of mind would have been their lot, but I established in the"},{"pageNumber":1323,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1254 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 32]Page 1254audience the true view of the subject. The lecturer was stating this; and the misconduct of one half-dead specimen ofheart ought not to destroy the impression of his words. \"There is no worse lie than a truth misunderstood,\" is a maximwhich I have heard ascribed to a former venerated President of Harvard. The heart's failure would have beenmisunderstood by the audience and given the lie to the lecturer. It was hard enough to make them understand thesubject anyhow; so that even now as I write in cool blood I am tempted to think that I acted quite correctly. I wasacting for the larger truth, at any rate, however automatically; and my sense of this was probably what prevented themore pedantic and literal part of my conscience from checking the action of my sympathetic finger. To this day thememory of that critical emergency has made me feel charitable towards all mediums who make phenomena come inone way when they won't come easily in another. On the principles of the S. P. R., my conduct on that one occasionought to discredit everything I ever do, everything for example, I may write in this article,—a manifestly unjustconclusion.Fraud, conscious or unconscious, seems ubiquitous throughout the range of physical phenomena of spiritism, andfalse pretense, prevarication and fishing for clues are ubiquitous in the mental manifestations of mediums. If it be noteverywhere fraud simulating reality, one is tempted to say, then the reality (if any reality there be) has the bad luck ofbeing fated everywhere to simulate fraud. The suggestion of humbug seldom stops, and mixes itself with the bestmanifestations. Mrs. Piper's control, \"Rector,\" is a most impressive personage, who discerns in an extraordinarydegree his sitter's inner needs, and is capable of giving elevated counsel to fastidious and critical minds. Yet in manyrespects he is an arrant humbug—such he seems to me at least—pretending to a knowledge and power to which hehas no title, nonplussed by contradiction, yielding to suggestion, and covering his tracks with plausible excuses. Nowthe non-\"researching\" mind looks upon such phenomena simply according to their face-pretension and never thinks ofasking what they may signify below the surface. Since they profess for the most part to be revealers of spirit life, it iseither as being absolutely that,"},{"pageNumber":1324,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1255 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 32]Page 1255or as being absolute frauds, that they are judged. The result is an inconceivably shallow state of public opinion on thesubject. One set of persons, emotionally touched at hearing the names of their loved ones given, and consoled byassurances that they are \"happy,\" accept the revelation, and consider spiritualism \"beautiful.\" More hard-headedsubjects, disgusted by the revelation's contemptible contents, outraged by the fraud, and prejudiced beforehand againstall \"spirits,\" high or low, avert their minds from what they call such ''rot\" or \"bosh\" entirely. Thus do two oppositesentimentalisms divide opinion between them! A good expression of the \"scientific\" state of mind occurs in Huxley's\"Life and Letters\":\"I regret,\" he writes, \"that I am unable to accept the invitation of the Committee of the Dialectical Society. I take nointerest in the subject. The only case of 'Spiritualism' I have ever had the opportunity of examining into for myselfwas as gross an imposture as ever came under my notice. But supposing these phenomena to be genuine—they do notinterest me. If anybody would endow me with the faculty of listening to the chatter of old women and curates in thenearest provincial town, I should decline the privilege, having better things to do. And if the folk in the spiritual worlddo not talk more wisely and sensibly than their friends report them to do, I put them in the same category. The onlygood that I can see in the demonstration of the 'Truth of Spiritualism' is to furnish an additional argument againstsuicide. Better live a crossing-sweeper, than die and be made to talk twaddle by a 'medium' hired at a guinea aSeance.\"1Obviously the mind of the excellent Huxley has here but two whole-souled categories, namely revelation orimposture, to apperceive the case by. Sentimental reasons bar revelation out, for the messages, he thinks, are notromantic enough for that; fraud exists anyhow; therefore the whole thing is nothing but imposture. The odd point isthat so few of those who talk in this way realize that they and the spiritists are using the same major premise anddiffering only in the minor. The major premise is: \"Any spirit-revelation must be romantic.\" The minor of the spiritistis: \"This is romantic\"; that of the1T. H. Huxley, \"Life and Letters,\" I, 240."},{"pageNumber":1325,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1256 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 33]Page 1256Huxleyan is: \"this is dingy twaddle\"—whence their opposite conclusions!Meanwhile the first thing that anyone learns who attends seriously to these phenomena is that their causation is far toocomplex for our feelings about what is or is not romantic enough to be spiritual to throw any light upon it. The causalfactors must be carefully distinguished and traced through series, from their simplest to their strongest forms, beforewe can begin to understand the various resultants in which they issue. Myers and Gurney began this work, the one byhis serial study of the various sorts of \"automatism,\" sensory and motor, the other by his experimental proofs that asplit-off consciousness may abide after a post-hypnotic suggestion has been given. Here we have subjective factors;but are not transsubjective or objective forces also at work? Veridical messages, apparitions, movements withoutcontact, seem prima facie to be such. It was a good stroke on Gurney's part to construct a theory of apparitions whichbrought the subjective and the objective factors into harmonious co-operation. I doubt whether this telepathic theoryof Gurney's will hold along the whole line of apparitions to which he applied it, but it is unquestionable that sometheory of that mixed type is required for the explanation of all mediumistic phenomena; and that when all thepsychological factors and elements involved have been told off—and they are many—the question still forces itselfupon us: Are these all, or are there indications of any residual forces acting on the subject from beyond, or of any\"metapsychic\" faculty, (to use Richet's useful term) exerted by him? This is the problem that requires real expertness,and this is where the simple sentimentalisms of the spiritist and scientist leave us in the lurch completely.\"Psychics\" form indeed a special branch of education, in which experts are only gradually becoming developed. Thephenomena are as massive and wide-spread as is anything in Nature, and the study of them is as tedious, repellent andundignified. To reject it for its unromantic character is like rejecting bacteriology because penicillium glaucum growson horse-dung and bacterium termo lives in putrefaction.

When imposture has been checked off as far as possible, when chance coincidence has beenallowed for, when opportunities for normal knowledge on the part of the subject have been noted, and skill in\"fishing\" and following clues unwittingly furnished by the voice or face of by-standers have been counted in, thosewho have the fullest acquaintance with the phenomena admit that in good mediums there is a residuum of knowledgedisplayed that can only be called supernormal: the medium taps some source of information not open to ordinarypeople. Myers used the word \"telepathy\" to indicate that the sitter's own thoughts or feelings may be thus directlytapped. Mrs. Sidgwick has suggested that if living minds can be thus tapped telepathically, so possibly may the mindsof spirits be similarly tapped—if spirits there be. On this view we should have one distinct theory of the performancesof a typical test-medium. They would be all originally due to an odd tendency to personate, found in her dream life asit expresses itself in trance. [Most of us reveal such a tendency whenever we handle a \"ouijaboard\" or a \"planchet,\" orlet ourselves write automatically with a pencil.] The result is a ''control,\" who purports to be speaking; and all theresources of the automatist, including his or her trance-faculty of telepathy, are called into play in building thisfictitious personage out plausibly. On such a view of the control, the medium's will to personate runs the whole show;and if spirits be involved in it at all, they are passive beings, stray bits of whose memory she is able to seize and usefor her purposes, without the spirit being any more aware of it than the sitter is aware of it when his own mind issimilarly tapped.This is one possible way of interpreting a certain type of psychical phenomenon. It uses psychological as well as\"spiritual\" factors, and quite obviously it throws open for us far more questions than it answers, questions about oursubconscious constitution and its curious tendency to humbug, about the telepathic faculty, and about the possibilityof an existent spirit-world.I do not instance this theory to defend it, but simply to show what complicated hypotheses one is inevitably led toconsider, the moment one looks at the facts in their com-"},{"pageNumber":1327,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1258 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 34]Page 1258plexity and turns one's back on the naïve alternative of \"revelation or imposture,\" which is as far as either spiritistthought or ordinary scientist thought goes. The phenomena are endlessly complex in their factors, and they are so littleunderstood as yet that off-hand judgments, whether of \"spirits\" or of \"bosh'' are the one as silly as the other. When wecomplicate the subject still farther by considering what connection such things as rappings, apparitions, poltergeists,spirit-photographs, and materializations may have with it, the bosh end of the scale gets heavily loaded, it is true, butyour geniune inquirer still is loath to give up. He lets the data collect, and bides his time. He believes that \"bosh\" is nomore an ultimate element in Nature, or a really explanatory category in human life than \"dirt\" is in chemistry. Everykind of \"bosh\" has its own factors and laws; and patient study will bring them definitely to light.The only way to rescue the \"pure bosh\" view of the matter is one which has sometimes appealed to my own fancy, butwhich I imagine few readers will seriously adopt. If, namely, one takes the theory of evolution radically, one ought toapply it not only to the rock-strata, the animals and the plants, but to the stars, to the chemical elements, and to thelaws of nature. There must have been a far-off antiquity, one is then tempted to suppose, when things were reallychaotic. Little by little, out of all the haphazard possibilities of that time, a few connected things and habits arose, andthe rudiments of regular performance began. Every variation in the way of law and order added itself to this nucleus,which inevitably grew more considerable as history went on; while the aberrant and inconstant variations, not beingsimilarly preserved, disappeared from being, wandered off as unrelated vagrants, or else remained so imperfectlyconnected with the part of the world that had grown regular as only to manifest their existence by occasional lawlessintrusions, like those which \"psychic\" phenomena now make into our scientifically organized world. On such a view,these phenomena ought to remain \"pure bosh\" forever, that is, they ought to be forever intractable to intellectualmethods, because they should not yet be organized enough in themselves to follow any laws.

Their relation to the cosmos would be tangential solely.Looked at dramatically, most occult phenomena make just this sort of impression. They are inwardly as incoherent asthey are outwardly wayward and fitful. If they express anything, it is pure \"bosh,\" pure discontinuity, accident, anddisturbance, with no law apparent but to interrupt, and no purpose but to baffle. They seem like stray vestiges of thatprimordial irrationality, from which all our rationalities have been evolved.To settle dogmatically into this bosh-view would save labor, but it would go against too many intellectualprepossessions to be adopted save as a last resort of despair. Your psychical researcher therefore bates no jot of hope,and has faith that when we get our data numerous enough, some sort of rational treatment of them will succeed.When I hear good people say (as they often say, not without show of reason), that dabbling in such phenomenareduces us to a sort of jelly, disintegrates the critical faculties, liquefies the character, and makes of one a gobe-mouche generally, I console myself by thinking of my friends Frederic Myers and Richard Hodgson. These men livedexclusively for psychical research, and it converted both to spiritism. Hodgson would have been a man among menanywhere; but I doubt whether under any other baptism he would have been that happy, sober and righteous form ofenergy which his face proclaimed him in his later years, when heart and head alike were wholly satisfied by hisoccupation. Myers's character also grew stronger in every particular for his devotion to the same inquiries. Brought upon literature and sentiment, something of a courtier, passionate, disdainful, and impatient naturally, he was made overagain from the day when he took up psychical research seriously. He became learned in science, circumspect,democratic in sympathy, endlessly patient, and above all, happy. The fortitude of his last hours touched the heroic, socompletely were the atrocious sufferings of his body cast into insignificance by his interest in the cause he lived for.When a man's pursuit gradually makes his face shine and"},{"pageNumber":1329,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1260 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 35]Page 1260grow handsome, you may be sure it is a worthy one. Both Hodgson and Myers kept growing ever handsomer andstronger-looking.Such personal examples will convert no one, and of course they ought not to. Nor do I seek at all in this article toconvert any one to my belief that psychical research is an important branch of science. To do that, I should have toquote evidence; and those for whom the volumes of S. P. R. Proceedings already published count for nothing wouldremain in their dogmatic slumber, though one rose from the dead. No, not to convert readers, but simply to put myown state of mind upon record publicly is the purpose of my present writing. Some one said to me a short time agothat after my twenty-five years of dabbling in \"Psychics,\" it would be rather shameful were I unable to state anydefinite conclusions whatever as a consequence. I had to agree; so I now proceed to take up the challenge and expresssuch convictions as have been engendered in me by that length of experience, be the same true or false ones. I may bedooming myself to the pit in the eyes of better-judging posterity; I may be raising myself to honor; I am willing totake the risk, for what I shall write is my truth, as I now see it.I began this article by confessing myself baffled. I am baffled, as to spirit-return, and as to many other specialproblems. I am also constantly baffled as to what to think of this or that particular story, for the sources of error in anyone observation are seldom fully knowable. But weak sticks make strong faggots; and when the stories fall intoconsistent sorts that point each in a definite direction, one gets a sense of being in presence of genuinely natural typesof phenomena. As to there being such real natural types of phenomena ignored by orthodox science, I am not baffledat all, for I am fully convinced of it. One cannot get demonstrative proof here. One has to follow one's personal sense,which, of course, is liable to err, of the dramatic probabilities of nature. Our critics here obey their sense of dramaticprobability as much as we do. Take \"raps\" for example, and the whole business of objects moving without contact.\"Nature,\" thinks the scientific man, is not so unutterably silly.

It probably is, in an indefinite majority ofinstances; yet it is to me dramatically improbable that the swindling should not have accreted round some originallygenuine nucleus. If we look at human imposture as a historic phenomenon, we find it always imitative. One swindlerimitates a previous swindler, but the first swindler of that kind imitated some one who was honest. You can no morecreate an absolutely new trick than you can create a new word without any previous basis.—You don't know how togo about it. Try, reader, yourself, to invent an unprecedented kind of \"physical phenomenon of spiritualism.\" When Itry, I find myself mentally turning over the regular medium-stock, and thinking how I might improve some item. Thisbeing the dramatically probable human way, I think differently of the whole type, taken collectively, from the way inwhich I may think of the single instance. I find myself believing that there is \"something in\" these never endingreports of physical phenomena, although I haven't yet the least positive notion of the something. It becomes to mymind simply a very worthy problem for investigation. Either I or the scientist is of course a fool, with our oppositeviews of probability here; and I only wish he might feel the liability, as cordially as I do, to pertain to both of us.I fear I look on Nature generally with more charitable eyes than his, though perhaps he would pause if he realized as Ido, how vast the fraudulency is which in consistency he must attribute to her. Nature is brutal enough, Heaven knows;but no one yet has held her non-human side to be dishonest, and even in the human sphere deliberate deceit is farrarer than the \"classic\" intellect, with its few and rigid categories, was ready to acknowledge. There is a hazypenumbra in us all where lying and delusion meet, where passion rules beliefs as well as conduct, and where the term\"scoundrel\" does not clear up everything to the depths as it did for our forefathers. The first automatic writing I eversaw was forty years ago. I unhesitatingly thought of it as deceit, although it contained vague elements of supernormalknowledge. Since then I have come to see in automatic writing one example of a department of human activity as vastas it is enigmatic.

Our subconscious region seems, as a rule, to be dominated either by a crazy \"will tomake-believe,\" or by some curious external force impelling us to personation. The first difference between thepsychical researcher and the inexpert person is that the former realizes the commonness and typicality of thephenomenon here, while the latter, less informed, thinks it so rare as to be unworthy of attention. I wish to go onrecord for the commonness.The next thing I wish to go on record for is the presence, in the midst of all the humbug, of really supernormalknowledge. By this I mean knowledge that cannot be traced to the ordinary sources of information—the sensesnamely, of the automatist. In really strong mediums this knowledge seems to be abundant, though it is usually spotty,capricious and unconnected. Really strong mediums are rarities; but when one starts with them and works downwardsinto less brilliant regions of the automatic life, one tends to interpret many slight but odd coincidences with truth aspossibly rudimentary forms of this kind of knowledge.What is one to think of this queer chapter in human nature? It is odd enough on any view. If all it means is apreposterous and inferior monkey-like tendency to forge messages, systematically embedded in the soul of all of us, itis weird; and weirder still that it should then own all this supernormal information. If on the other hand thesupernormal information be the key to the phenomenon, it ought to be superior; and then how ought we to account forthe \"wicked partner,\" and for the undeniable mendacity and inferiority of so much of the performance? We arethrown, for our conclusions, upon our instinctive sense of the dramatic probabilities of nature. My own dramatic sensetends instinctively to picture the situation as an interaction between slumbering faculties in the automatist's mind anda cosmic environment of other consciousness of some sort which is able to work upon them. If there were in theuniverse a lot of diffuse soul-stuff, unable of itself to get into consistent per-"},{"pageNumber":1332,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1263 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 37]Page 1263sonal form, or to take permanent possession of an organism, yet always craving to do so, it might get its head into theair, parasitically, so to speak, by profiting by weak spots in the armor of human minds, and slipping in and stirring upthere the sleeping tendency to personate. It would induce habits in the subconscious region of the mind it used thus,and would seek above all things to prolong its social opportunities by making itself agreeable and plausible. It woulddrag stray scraps of truth with it from the wider environment, but would betray its mental inferiority by knowing littlehow to weave them into any important or significant story.This, I say, is the dramatic view which my mind spontaneously takes, and it has the advantage of falling into line withancient human traditions. The views of others are just as dramatic, for the phenomenon is actuated by will of somesort anyhow, and wills give rise to dramas. The spiritist view, as held by Messrs. Hyslop and Hodgson, sees a \"will tocommunicate,\" struggling through inconceivable layers of obstruction in the conditions. I have heard Hodgson likenthe difficulties to those of two persons who on earth should have only dead-drunk servants to use as their messengers.The scientist, for his part, sees a \"will to deceive,\" watching its chance in all of us, and able (possibly?) to use\"telepathy\" in its service.Which kind of will, and how many kinds of will are most inherently probable? Who can say with certainty? The onlycertainty is that the phenomena are enormously complex, especially if one includes in them such intellectual flights ofmediumship as Swedenborg's, and if one tries in any way to work the physical phenomena in. That is why Ipersonally am as yet neither a convinced believer in parasitic demons, nor a spiritist, nor a scientist, but still remain apsychical researcher waiting for more facts before concluding.Out of my experience, such as it is (and it is limited enough) one fixed conclusion dogmatically emerges, and that isthis, that we with our lives are like islands in the sea, or like trees in the forest. The maple and the pine may whisperto each other with their leaves, and Conanicut and Newport hear each other's fog-horns.

Just so there is a continuum of cosmic consciousness, against which ourindividuality builds but accidental fences, and into which our several minds plunge as into a mother-sea or reservoir.Our \"normal\" consciousness is circumscribed for adaptation to our external earthly environment, but the fence is weakin spots, and fitful influences from beyond leak in, showing the otherwise unverifiable common connection. Not onlypsychic research, but metaphysical philosophy, and speculative biology are led in their own ways to look with favoron some such \"panpsychic\" view of the universe as this. Assuming this common reservoir of consciousness to exist,this bank upon which we all draw, and in which so many of earth's memories must in some way be stored, ormediums would not get at them as they do, the question is, What is its own structure? What is its inner topography?This question, first squarely formulated by Myers, deserves to be called \"Myers's problem\" by scientific menhereafter. What are the conditions of individuation or insulation in the mother-sea? To what tracts, to what activesystems functioning separately in it, do personalities correspond? Are individual \"spirits'' constituted there? Hownumerous, and of how many hierarchic orders may these then be? How permanent? How transient? And howconfluent with one another may they become?What again, are the relations between the cosmic consciousness and matter? Are there subtler forms of matter whichupon occasion may enter into functional connection with the individuation in the psychic sea, and then, and then only,show themselves?—So that our ordinary human experience, on its material as well as on its mental side, would appearto be only an extract from the larger psycho-physical world?Vast, indeed, and difficult is the inquirer's prospect here, and the most significant data for his purpose will probably bejust these dingy little mediumistic facts which the Huxleyan minds of our time find so unworthy of their attention.But when was not the science of the future stirred to its conquering activities by the little rebellious exceptions to thescience of the present?

His thought and Bergson's run parallel for such a distance, yet diverge so utterly at lastthat a comparison seems to me instructive. The watershed is such a knife-edge that no reader who leans to one side orthe other can after this plead ignorance of the motives of his choice.Bradley's first great act of candor in philosophy was his breaking loose from the Kantian tradition that immediatefeeling is all disconnectedness. In his \"Logic\" as well as in his \"Appearance\" he insisted that in the flux of feeling wedirectly encounter reality, and that its form, as thus encountered, is the continuity and wholeness of a transparentmuch-at-once. This is identically Bergson's doctrine. In affirming the \"endosmosis\" of adjacent parts of ''living\"experience, the French writer treats the minimum of feeling as an immediately intuited much-at-once.The idealist tradition is that feelings, aboriginally discontinuous, are woven into continuity by the various syntheticconcepts which the intellect applies. Both Bradley and Bergson contradict this flatly; and although their tactics are sodifferent, their tactics are so different, their battle is the same. They destroy the notion that conception is essentially aunifying process. For Bergson all concepts are discrete; and though you can get the discrete out of the continuous, outof the discrete you can never construct the continuous again. Concepts, moreover, are static, and can never beadequate substitutes for a perceptual flux of which activity and change are inalienable features. Concepts, saysBergson, make things less, not more, intelligible, when we use them seriously and radically. They serve us practicallymore than theoretically. Throwing their map of abstract terms and relations round our present experience, they showits bearings and let us plan our way.Bradley is just as independent of rationalist tradition, and is more thoroughgoing still in his criticism of the conceptual"},{"pageNumber":1336,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1267 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 39]Page 1267function. When we handle felt realities by our intellect they grow, according to him, less and less comprehensible;activity becomes inconstruable, relation contradictory, change inadmissible, personality unintelligible, time, space, andcausation impossible—nothing survives the Bradleyan wreck.The breach which the two authors make with previous rationalist opinion is complete, and they keep step with eachother perfectly up to the point where they diverge. Senseperception, first develops into conception; and thendeveloping its subtler and more contradictory implications, comes to an end of its usefulness for both authors, andruns itself into the ground. Arrived at this conviction, Bergson drops conception—which apparently has done us allthe good it can do; and, turning back towards perception with its transparent multiplicity-in-union, he takes its dataintegrally up into philosophy, as a kind of material which nothing else can replace. The fault of our perceptual data,he tells us, is not of nature, but only of extent; and the way to know reality intimately is, according to thisphilosopher, to sink into those data and get our sympathetic imagination to enlarge their bounds. Deep knowledge isnot of the conceptually mediated, but of the immediate type. Bergson thus allies himself with old-fashionedempiricism, on the one hand, and with mysticism, on the other. His breach with rationalism could not possibly bemore thorough than it is.Bradley's breach is just as thorough in its first two steps. The form of oneness in the flow of feeling is an attribute ofreality which even the absolute must preserve. Concepts are an organ of misunderstanding rather than ofunderstanding; they turn the \"reality\" which we \"encounter\" into an \"appearance\" which we \"think.'' But with all thisanti-rationalist matter, Bradley is faithful to his anti-empiricist manner to the end. Crude unmediated feelings shallnever form a part of \"truth.\" \"Judgment, on our view,\" he writes, \"transcends and must transcend the immediate unityof feeling upon which it can not cease to depend. Judgment has to qualify the real ideally. This is the fundamentalinconsistency of judgment, for ideas can not qualify reality as reality is qualified immediately in feeling. The realityas conditioned"},{"pageNumber":1337,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1268 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 39]Page 1268in feeling has been in principle abandoned, while other conditions have not been found.\"1Abandoned in \"principle,\" Mr. Bradley says; and, in sooth, nothing but a sort of religious principle against admitting\"untransformed\" feeling into philosophy would seem to explain his procedure from here onwards. \"At the entrance ofphilosophy,\" he says, \"there appears to be a point at which the roads divide. By the one way you set out to seek truthin ideas. On this road what is sought is ideas, and nothing else is current. If you enter here you are committed to thisprinciple. [This] whole way doubtless may be delusion; but, if you choose to take this way no possible appeal todesignation [i. e., to feeling] in the end is permitted. This I take to be the way of philosophy. It is not the way oflife or of common knowledge, and to commit oneself to such a principle may be said to depend upon choice. The wayof life starts from and in the end it rests on dependence upon feeling. Outside of philosophy there is no consistentcourse but to accept the unintelligible. For worse or for better the man who stands on particular feeling must remainoutside of philosophy. I recognize that in life and in ordinary knowledge one can never wholly cease to rest on thisground. But how to take over into ultimate theory and to use there this certainty of feeling, while still leaving thatuntransformed, I myself do not know. I admit that philosophy, as I conceive it, is one-sided. I understand the dislikeof it and the despair of it while this its defect is not remedied. But to remedy the defect by imparting bodily intophilosophy the 'this' and 'thine,' as they are felt, to my mind brings destruction on the spot.''2Mr. Bradley's \"principle\" seems to be only that of doggedly following a line once entered on to the bitterest of ends.We encounter reality in feeling, and find that when we develop it into ideas it becomes more intelligible in certaindefinite respects. We then have \"truth\" instead of reality; which truth, however, pursued beyond a certain practicalpoint, develops into the whole bog of unintelligibilities1Mind, October, 1909, p. 498.2Ibid., pp. 500 502."},{"pageNumber":1338,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1269 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 40]Page 1269through which the critical part of \"Appearance and Reality\" wades. The wise and natural course at this point wouldseem to be to drop the notion that truth is a thoroughgoing improvement on reality, to confess that its value is limited,and to hark back. But there is nothing that Mr. Bradley, religiously loyal to the direction of development once enteredupon, will not do sooner than this. Forward, forward, let us range! He makes the desperate transconceptual leap,assumes beyond the whole ideal perspective an ultimate \"suprarelational\" and trans-conceptual reality in whichsomehow the wholeness and certainty and unity of feeling, which we turned our backs on forever when we committedourselves to the leading of ideas, are supposed to be resurgent in transfigured form; and shows us as the onlyauthentic object of philosophy, with its \"way of ideas,'' an absolute which \"can be\" and \"must be\" and therefore \"is.\"\"It shall be\" is the only candid way of stating its relation to belief; and Mr. Bradley's statement comes very near tothat.How could the elements of a situation be made more obvious? Or what could bring to a sharper focus the factor ofpersonal choice involved?The way of philosophy is not the way of life, Mr. Bradley admits, but for the philosopher, he continues, it seems to beall there is—which is like saying that the way of starvation is not the way of life, but to the starveling it is all there is.Be it so! Though what obliges one to become either such a philosopher or such a starveling does not clearly appear.The only motive I can possibly think of for choosing to be a philosopher on these painful terms is the old andobstinate intellectualist prejudice in favor of universals. They are loftier, nobler, more rational objects than theparticulars of sense. In their direction, then, and away from feeling, should a mind conscious of its high vocationalways turn its face. Not to enter life is a higher vocation than to enter it, on this view.The motive is pathetically simple, and any one can take it in. On the thin watershed between life and philosophy, Mr.Bradley tumbles to philosophy's call. Down he slides, to the dry valley of \"absolute\" mare's nests and abstractions, thehabitation of the fictitious suprarelational being which his will prefers.

Yet once committed to the conceptual direction, Mr. Bradley thinks we can't reverse, we can save ourselvesonly by hoping that the absolute will re-realize unintelligibly and \"somehow,\" the unity, wholeness, certainty, etc.,which feeling so immediately and transparently made us acquainted with at first.Bergson and the empiricists, on the other hand, tumble to life's call, and turn into the valley where the green pasturesand the clear waters always were. If in sensible particulars reality reveals the manyness-in-oneness of its constitutionin so convincing a way, why then withhold, if you will, the name of \"philosophy\" from perceptual knowledge, butrecognize that perceptual knowledge is at any rate the only complete kind of knowledge, and let \"philosophy\" inBradley's sense pass for the one-sided affair which he candidly confesses that it is. When the alternative lies betweenknowing life in its full thickness and activity, as one acquainted with its me's and thee's and now's and here's, on theone hand, and knowing a transconceptual evaporation like the absolute, on the other, it seems to me that to choose thelatter knowledge merely because it has been named \"philosophy\" is to be superstitiously loyal to a name. But if namesare to be used eulogistically, rather let us give that of philosophy to the fuller kind of knowledge, the kind in whichperception and conception mix their lights.As one who calls himself a radical empiricist, I can find no possible excuse for not inclining towards Bergson's side.He and Bradley together have confirmed my confidence in non- \"transmuted\" percepts, and have broken myconfidence in concepts down. It seems to me that their parallel lines of work have converged to a sharp alternativewhich now confronts everybody, and in which the reasons for one's choice must plainly appear and be told. Be anempiricist or be a transconceptualist, whichever you please, but at least say why!

Most of thewritings I have seen have treated the subject from the outside, for I know of no one who has spoken as having thedirect authority of experience in favor of his views. I also am an outsider, and very likely what I say will prove thefact loudly enough to readers who possibly may stand within the pale. Nevertheless, since between outsiders one is asgood as another, I will not leave my suggestion unexpressed.The suggestion, stated very briefly, is that states of mystical intuition may be only very sudden and great extensions ofthe ordinary \"field of consciousness.\" Concerning the causes of such extensions I have no suggestion to make; but theextension itself would, if my view be correct, consist in an immense spreading of the margin of the field, so thatknowledge ordinarily transmarginal would become included, and the ordinary margin would grow more central.Fechner's \"wavescheme\" will diagrammatize the alteration, as I conceive it, if we suppose that the wave of presentawareness, steep above the horizontal line that represents the plane of the usual \"threshold,\" slopes away below it verygradually in all directions. A fall of the threshold, however caused, would, under these circumstances, produce thestate of things which we see on an unusually flat shore at the ebb of a spring-tide. Vast tracts usually covered are thenrevealed to view, but nothing rises more than a few inches above the water's bed, and great parts of the scene aresubmerged again, whenever a wave washes over them.Some persons have naturally a very wide, others a very narrow, field of consciousness. The narrow field may berepresented by an unusually steep form of the wave. When by any accident the threshold lowers, in persons of thistype—I speak here from direct personal experience—so that the field widens and the relations of its center to mattersusually subliminal come into view, the larger panorama perceived fills the mind with exhilaration and sense of mentalpower. It is a refreshing experience; and—such is now my"},{"pageNumber":1342,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1273 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 43]Page 1273hypothesis—we only have to suppose it to occur in an exceptionally extensive form, to give us a mystical paroxysm,if such a term be allowed.A few remarks about the field of consciousness may be needed to give more definiteness to my hypothesis. The fieldis composed at all times of a mass of present sensation, in a cloud of memories, emotions, concepts, etc. Yet theseingredients, which have to be named separately, are not separate, as the conscious field contains them. Its form is thatof a much-at-once, in the unity of which the sensations, memories, concepts, impulses, etc., coalesce and aredissolved. The present field as a whole came continuously out of its predecessor and will melt into its successor ascontinuously again, one sensation-mass passing into another sensation-mass and giving the character of a graduallychanging present to the experience, while the memories and concepts carry time-coefficients which place whatever ispresent in a temporal perspective more or less vast.When, now, the threshold falls, what comes into view is not the next mass of sensation; for sensation requires newphysical stimulations to produce it, and no alteration of a purely mental threshold can create these. Only in case thephysical stimuli were already at work subliminally, preparing the next sensation, would whatever sub-sensation wasalready prepared reveal itself when the threshold fell. But with the memories, concepts, and conational states, the caseis different. Nobody knows exactly how far we are \"marginally\" conscious of these at ordinary times, or how farbeyond the \"margin\" of our present thought trans-marginal consciousness, of them may exist.1 There is at any rate nodefinite bound set between what is central and what is marginal in consciousness, and the margin itself has no definitebound a parte foris. It is like the field of vision, which the slightest movement of1Transmarginal or subliminal, the terms are synonymous. Some psychologists deny the existence of such consciousness altogether (A. H.Pierce, for example, and Münsterberg apparently). Others, e. g., Bergson, make it exist and carry the whole freight of our past. Othersagain (as Myers) would have it extend (in the \"telepathic\" mode of communication) from one person's mind into another's. For thepurposes of my hypothesis I have to postulate its existence; and once postulating it, I prefer not to set any definite bounds to its extent."},{"pageNumber":1343,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1274 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 43]Page 1274the eye will extend, revealing objects that always stood there to be known. My hypothesis is that a movement of thethreshold downwards will similarly bring a mass of subconscious memories, conceptions, emotional feelings, andperceptions of relation, etc., into view all at once; and that if this enlargement of the nimbus that surrounds thesensational present is vast enough, while no one of the items it contains attracts our attention singly, we shall have theconditions fulfilled for a kind of consciousness in all essential respects like that termed mystical. It will be transient, ifthe change of threshold is transient. It will be of reality, enlargement, and illumination, possibly rapturously so. It willbe of unification, for the present coalesces in it with ranges of the remote quite out of its reach under ordinarycircumstances; and the sense of relation will be greatly enhanced. Its form will be intuitive or perceptual, notconceptual, for the remembered or conceived objects in the enlarged field are supposed not to attract the attentionsingly, but only to give the sense of a tremendous muchness suddenly revealed. If they attracted attention separately,we should have the ordinary steep-waved consciousness, and the mystical character would depart.Such is my suggestion. Persons who know something of mystical experience will no doubt find in it much to criticize.If any such shall do so with definiteness, it will have amply served its purpose of helping our understanding ofmystical states to become more precise.The notion I have tried (at such expense of metaphor) to set forth was originally suggested to me by certainexperiences of my own, which could only be described as very sudden and incomprehensible enlargements of theconscious field, bringing with them a curious sense of cognition of real fact. All have occurred within the past fiveyears; three of them were similar in type; the fourth was unique.In each of the three like cases, the experience broke in abruptly upon a perfectly commonplace situation and lastedperhaps less than two minutes. In one instance I was engaged in conversation, but I doubt whether the interlocutornoticed my abstraction. What happened each time was that I seemed all at once to be reminded of a past experience;and this reminiscence, ere I could conceive or name it distinctly,"},{"pageNumber":1344,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1275 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 44]Page 1275developed into something further that belonged with it, this in turn into something further still, and so on, until theprocess faded out, leaving me amazed at the sudden vision of increasing ranges of distant fact of which I could giveno articulate account. The mode of consciousness was perceptual, not conceptual—the field expanding so fast thatthere seemed no time for conception or identification to get in its work. There was a strongly exciting sense that myknowledge of past (or present?) reality was enlarging pulse by pulse, but so rapidly that my intellectual processescould not keep up the pace. The content was thus entirely lost to retrospection—it sank into the limbo into whichdreams vanish as we gradually awake. The feeling—I won't call it belief—that I had had a sudden opening, had seenthrough a window, as it were, distant realities that incomprehensibly belonged with my own life, was so acute that Ican not shake it off to-day.This conviction of fact-revealed, together with the perceptual form of the experience and the inability to makearticulate report, are all characters of mystical states. The point of difference is that in my case certain specialdirections only, in the field of reality, seemed to get suddenly uncovered, whereas in classical mystical experiences itappears rather as if the whole of reality were uncovered at once. Uncovering of some sort is the essence of thephenomenon, at any rate, and is what, in the language of the Fechnerian wave-metaphor, I have used the expression\"fall of the threshold\" to denote.My fourth experience of uncovering had to do with dreams. I was suddenly intromitted into the congnizance of a pairof dreams that I could not remember myself to have had, yet they seemed somehow to connect with me. I despair ofgiving the reader any just idea of the bewildering confusion of mind into which I was thrown by this, the mostintensely peculiar experience of my whole life. I wrote a full memorandum of it a couple of days after it happened,and appended some reflections. Even though it should cast no light on the conditions of mysticism, it seems as if thisrecord might be worthy of publication, simply as a contribution to the descriptive literature of pathological mentalstates. I let it follow, therefore, as originally written, with only a few words altered to make the account more clear."},{"pageNumber":1345,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1276 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 45]Page 1276\"San Francisco, Feb. 14th 1906.—The night before last, in my bed at Stanford University, I woke at about 7:30 A.M.,from a quiet dream of some sort, and whilst gathering my waking wits, seemed suddenly to get mixed up withreminiscences of a dream of an entirely different sort, which seemed to telescope, as it were, into the first one, adream very elaborate, of lions, and tragic. I concluded this to have been a previous dream of the same sleep; but theapparent mingling of two dreams was something very queer, which I had never before experienced.\"On the following night (Feb. 12 13) I awoke suddenly from my first sleep, which appeared to have been very heavy,in the middle of a dream, in thinking of which I became suddenly confused by the contents of two other dreams thatshuffled themselves abruptly in between the parts of the first dream, and of which I couldn't grasp the origin. Whencecome these dreams? I asked. They were close to me, and fresh, as if I had just dreamed them; and yet they were faraway from the first dream. The contents of the three had absolutely no connection. One had a cockney atmosphere, ithad happened to some one in London. The other two were American. One involved the trying on of a coat (was thisthe dream I seemed to wake from?) the other was a sort of nightmare and had to do with soldiers. Each had a whollydistinct emotional atmosphere that made its individuality discontinuous with that of the others. And yet, in a moment,as these three dreams alternately telescoped into and out of each other, and I seemed to myself to have been theircommon dreamer, they seemed quite as distinctly not to have been dreamed in succession, in that one sleep. When,then? Not on a previous night, either. When, then? and which was the one out of which I had just awakened? I couldno longer tell: one was as close to me as the others, and yet they entirely repelled each other, and I seemed thus tobelong to three different dream-systems at once, no one of which would connect itself either with the others or withmy waking life. I began to feel curiously confused and scared, and tried to wake myself up wider, but I seemedalready wide-awake. Presently cold shivers of dread ran over me: am I getting into other people's dreams? Is this a'telepathic' experience? Or an invasion of double (or treble)"},{"pageNumber":1346,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1277 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 45]Page 1277personality? Or is it a thrombus in a cortical artery? and the beginning of a general mental 'confusion' anddisorientation which is going on to develop who knows how far?\"Decidedly I was losing hold of my 'self,' and making acquaintance with a quality of mental distress that I had neverknown before, its nearest analogue being the sinking, giddying anxiety that one may have when, in the woods, onediscovers that one is really 'lost.' Most human troubles look towards a terminus. Most fears point in a direction, andconcentrate towards a climax. Most assaults of the evil one may be met by bracing oneself against something, one'sprinciples, one's courage, one's will, one's pride. But in this experience all was diffusion from a centre, and footholdswept away, the brace itself disintegrating all the faster as one needed its support more direly. Meanwhile vividperception (or remembrance) of the various dreams kept coming over me in alternation. Whose? whose? WHOSE?Unless I can attach them, I am swept out to sea with no horizon and no bond, getting lost. The idea aroused the'creeps' again, and with it the fear of again falling asleep and renewing the process. It had begun the previous night,but then the confusion had only gone one step, and had seemed simply curious. This was the second step—wheremight I be after a third step had been taken? My teeth chattered at the thought.\"At the same time I found myself filled with a new pity towards persons passing into dementia with Verwirrtheit, orinto invasions of secondary personality. We regard them as simply curious; but what they want in the awful drift oftheir being out of its customary self, is any principle of steadiness to hold on to. We ought to assure them and reassurethem that we will stand by them, and recognize the true self in them to the end. We ought to let them know that we arewith them and not (as too often we must seem to them) a part of the world that but confirms and publishes theirdeliquescence.\"Evidently I was in full possession of my reflective wits; and whenever I thus objectively thought of the situation inwhich I was, my anxieties ceased. But there was a tendency to relapse into the dreams and reminiscences, and torelapse vividly; and then the confusion recommenced, along with the emotion of dread lest it should develop farther."},{"pageNumber":1347,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1278 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 46]Page 1278\"Then I looked at my watch. Half past twelve! Midnight, therefore. And this gave me another reflective idea.Habitually, on going to bed, I fall into a very deep slumber from which I never naturally awaken until after two. Inever awaken, therefore, from a midnight dream, as I did to-night, so of midnight dreams my ordinary consciousnessretains no recollection. My sleep seemed terribly heavy as I woke tonight. Dream states carry dream memories—whymay not the two succedaneous dreams (whichever two of the three were succedaneous) be memories of twelve o'clockdreams of previous nights, swept in, along with the just-fading dream, into the just-waking system of memory? Why,in short, may I not be tapping, in a way precluded by my ordinary habit of life, the midnight stratum of my pastexperiences?\"This idea gave great relief—I felt now as if I were in full possession of my anima rationalis. I turned on my light,resolving to read myself to sleep. But I didn't read, I felt drowsy instead, and, putting out the light, soon was in thearms of Morpheus.\"I woke again two or three times before daybreak with no dream-experiences, and finally, with a curious, but notalarming, confusion between two dreams, similar to that which I had had the previous morning, I awoke to the newday at seven.\"Nothing peculiar happened the following night, so the thing seems destined not to develop any further.\"1The distressing confusion of mind in this experience was the exact opposite of mystical illumination, and equallyunmystical was the definiteness of what was perceived. But the exaltation of the sense of relation was mystical (theperplexity1I print the rest of my memorandum in the shape of a note:—\"Several ideas suggest themselves that make the observation instructive.\"First, the general notion, now gaining ground in mental medicine, that certain mental maladies may be foreshadowed in dream-life, and thattherefore the study of the latter may be profitable.\"Then the specific suggestion, that states of 'confusion,' loss of personality, apraxia, etc., so often taken to indicate cortical lesion ordegeneration of dementic type, may be very superficial functional affections. In my own case the confusion was foudroyante—a state ofconsciousness unique and unparalleled in my 64 years of the world's experience; yet it alternated quickly with perfectly rational states, as thisrecord shows.

To this day I feel that those extradreams were dreamed in reality, but when, where, and by whom, I can not guess.In the Open Court for December, 1909, Mr. Frederick Hall narrates a fit of ether-mysticism which agrees with myformula very well. When one of his doctors made a remark to the other, he chuckled, for he realized that these friends''believed they saw real things and causes, but they didn't, and I did. I was where the causes were and to see themrequired no more mental ability than to recognize a color as blue. The knowledge of how little [the doctors] actuallydid see, coupled with their evident feeling that they saw all there was, was funny to the last degree. [They] knew aslittle of the real causes as does the child who, viewing a passing train and noting its revolving wheels, supposes thatthey, turning of themselves, give to coaches and locomotive their momentum. Or imagine a man seated in a boat,surrounded by dense fog, and out of the fog seeing a flat stone leap from the crest of one wave to another. If he hadalways sat thus, his explanations must be very crude as compared with those of a man whose eyes could pierce fog,and who saw upon the shore the boy skipping stones. In some such way the remarks of the two physicians seemed tome like the last two 'skips' of a stone thrown from my side. All that was essential in the remark I knew before it wasmade. Thus to discover(Footnote continued from previous page)the threshold between the rational and the morbid state had, in my case, been temporarily lowered, and as if similar confusions might bevery near the line of possibility in all of us.\"There are also the suggestions of a telepathic entrance into some one else's dreams, and of a doubling up of personality. In point of fact Idon't know now 'who' had those three dreams, or which one 'I' first woke up from, so quickly did they substitute themselves back and forthfor each other, discontinuously. Their discontinuity was the pivot of the situation. My sense of it was as 'vivid' and 'original' an experience asanything Hume could ask for. And yet they kept telescoping!\"Then there is the notion that by waking at certain hours we may tap distinct strata of ancient dream-memory.\""},{"pageNumber":1349,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1280 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 47]Page 1280convincingly and for myself, that the things which are unseen are those of real importance, this was sufficientlystimulating.\"It is evident that Mr. Hall's marginal field got enormously enlarged by the ether, yet so little defined as to itsparticulars that what he perceived was mainly the thoroughgoing causal integration of its whole content. That thisperception brought with it a tremendous feeling of importance and superiority is a matter of course.I have treated the phenomenon under discussion as if it consisted in the uncovering of tracts of consciousness. Is theconsciousness already there waiting to be uncovered? and is it a veridical revelation of reality? These are questions onwhich I do not touch. In the subjects of the experience the \"emotion of conviction\" is always strong, and sometimesabsolute. The ordinary psychologist disposes of the phenomenon under the conveniently \"scientific\" head of petit mal,if not of \"bosh\" or ''rubbish.\" But we know so little of the noetic value of abnormal mental states of any kind that inmy own opinion we had better keep an open mind and collect facts sympathetically for a long time to come. We shallnot understand these alterations of consciousness either in this generation or in the next.The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods,February 17, 1910"},{"pageNumber":1350,"pageContent":" Page 1281The Moral Equivalent of WarThe war against war is going to be no holiday excursion or camping party. The military feelings are too deeplygrounded to abdicate their place among our ideals until better substitutes are offered than the glory and shame thatcome to nations as well as to individuals from the ups and downs of politics and the vicissitudes of trade. There issomething highly paradoxical in the modern man's relation to war. Ask all our millions, north and south, whether theywould vote now (were such a thing possible) to have our war for the Union expunged from history, and the record ofa peaceful transition to the present time substituted for that of its marches and battles, and probably hardly a handfulof eccentrics would say yes. Those ancestors, those efforts, those memories and legends, are the most ideal part ofwhat we now own together, a sacred spiritual possession worth more than all the blood poured out. Yet ask thosesame people whether they would be willing in cold blood to start another civil war now to gain another similarpossession, and not one man or woman would vote for the proposition. In modern eyes, precious though wars may be,they must not be waged solely for the sake of the ideal harvest. Only when forced upon one, only when an enemy'sinjustice leaves us no alternative, is a war now thought permissible.It was not thus in ancient times. The earlier men were hunting men, and to hunt a neighboring tribe, kill the males,loot the village and possess the females, was the most profitable, as well as the most exciting, way of living. Thuswere the more martial tribes selected, and in chiefs and peoples a pure pugnacity and love of glory came to minglewith the more fundamental appetite for plunder.Modern war is so expensive that we feel trade to be a better avenue to plunder; but modern man inherits all the innatepugnacity and all the love of glory of his ancestors. Showing war's irrationality and horror is of no effect upon him.The horrors make the fascination. War is the strong life; it is life in extremis; war-taxes are the only ones men neverhesitate to pay, as the budgets of all nations show us."},{"pageNumber":1351,"pageContent":" Page 1282History is a bath of blood. The Iliad is one long recital of how Diomedes and Ajax, Sarpedon and Hector killed. Nodetail of the wounds they made is spared us, and the Greek mind fed upon the story. Greek history is a panorama ofjingoism and imperialism—war for war's sake, all the citizens being warriors. It is horrible reading, because of theirrationality of it all—save for the purpose of making \"history\"—and the history is that of the utter ruin of acivilization in intellectual respects perhaps the highest the earth has ever seen.Those wars were purely piratical. Pride, gold, women, slaves, excitement, were their only motives. In thePeloponnesian war, for example, the Athenians ask the inhabitants of Melos (the island where the \"Venus of Milo\"was found), hitherto neutral, to own their lordship. The envoys meet, and hold a debate which Thucydides gives infull, and which, for sweet reasonableness of form, would have satisfied Matthew Arnold. \"The powerful exact whatthey can,\" said the Athenians, \"and the weak grant what they must.\" When the Meleans say that sooner than be slavesthey will appeal to the gods, the Athenians reply: \"Of the gods we believe and of men we know that, by a law of theirnature, wherever they can rule they will. This law was not made by us, and we are not the first to have acted upon it;we did but inherit it, and we know that you and all mankind, if you were as strong as we are, would do as we do. Somuch for the gods; we have told you why we expect to stand as high in their good opinion as you.\" Well, the Meleansstill refused, and their town was taken. \"The Athenians,'' Thucydides quietly says, \"thereupon put to death all whowere of military age and made slaves of the women and children. They then colonized the island, sending thither fivehundred settlers of their own.\"Alexander's career was piracy pure and simple, nothing but an orgy of power and plunder, made romantic by thecharacter of the hero. There was no rational principle in it, and the moment he died his generals and governorsattacked one another. The cruelty of those times is incredible. When Rome finally conquered Greece, Paulus Aemiliuswas told by the Roman Senate to reward his soldiers for their toil by \"giving\" them the old kingdom of Epirus.

How many they killed I know not; but in Etoliathey killed all the senators, five hundred and fifty in number. Brutus was \"the noblest Roman of them all,\" but toreanimate his soldiers on the eve of Philippi he similarly promises to give them the cities of Sparta and Thessalonicato ravage, if they win the fight.Such was the gory nurse that trained societies to cohesiveness. We inherit the warlike type; and for most of thecapacities of heroism that the human race is full of we have to thank this cruel history. Dead men tell no tales, and ifthere were any tribes of other type than this they have left no survivors. Our ancestors have bred pugnacity into ourbone and marrow, and thousands of years of peace won't breed it out of us. The popular imagination fairly fattens onthe thought of wars. Let public opinion once reach a certain fighting pitch, and no ruler can withstand it. In the Boerwar both governments began with bluff, but couldn't stay there, the military tension was too much for them. In 1898our people had read the word WAR in letters three inches high for three months in every newspaper. The pliantpolitician McKinley was swept away by their eagerness, and our squalid war with Spain became a necessity.At the present day, civilized opinion is a curious mental mixture. The military instincts and ideals are as strong asever, but are confronted by reflective criticisms which sorely curb their ancient freedom. Innumerable writers areshowing up the bestial side of military service. Pure loot and mastery seem no longer morally avowable motives, andpretexts must be found for attributing them solely to the enemy. England and we, our army and navy authoritiesrepeat without ceasing, arm solely for \"peace,\" Germany and Japan it is who are bent on loot and glory. \"Peace\" inmilitary mouths to-day is a synonym for \"war expected.\" The word has become a pure provocative, and nogovernment wishing peace sincerely should allow it ever to be printed in a newspaper. Every up-to-date Dictionaryshould say that \"peace\" and \"war'' mean the same thing, now in posse, now in actu. It may even reasonably be saidthat the intensely sharp competitive preparation for war by the nations is the real war, permanent, unceasing; and that"},{"pageNumber":1353,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1284 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 49]Page 1284the battles are only a sort of public verification of the mastery gained during the \"peace\"-interval.It is plain that on this subject civilized man has developed a sort of double personality. If we take European nations,no legitimate interest of any one of them would seem to justify the tremendous destructions which a war to compass itwould necessarily entail. It would seem as though common sense and reason ought to find a way to reach agreementin every conflict of honest interests. I myself think it our bounden duty to believe in such international rationality aspossible. But, as things stand, I see how desperately hard it is to bring the peace-party and the war-party together, andI believe that the difficulty is due to certain deficiencies in the program of pacificism which set the militaristimagination strongly, and to a certain extent justifiably, against it. In the whole discussion both sides are onimaginative and sentimental ground. It is but one utopia against another, and everything one says must be abstract andhypothetical. Subject to this criticism and caution, I will try to characterize in abstract strokes the opposite imaginativeforces, and point out what to my own very fallible mind seems the best utopian hypothesis, the most promising line ofconciliation.In my remarks, pacificist tho' I am, I will refuse to speak of the bestial side of the war-régime (already done justice toby many writers) and consider only the higher aspects of militaristic sentiment. Patriotism no one thinks discreditable;nor does any one deny that war is the romance of history. But inordinate ambitions are the soul of every patriotism,and the possibility of violent death the soul of all romance. The militarily patriotic and romantic-minded everywhere,and especially the professional military class, refuse to admit for a moment that war may be a transitory phenomenonin social evolution. The notion of a sheep's paradise like that revolts, they say, our higher imagination. Where thenwould be the steeps of life? If war had ever stopped, we should have to reinvent it, on this view, to redeem life fromflat degeneration.Reflective apologists for war at the present day all take it religiously. It is a sort of sacrament. Its profits are to thevanquished as well as to the victor; and quite apart from any question of profit, it is an absolute good, we are told, forit"},{"pageNumber":1354,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1285 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 49]Page 1285is human nature at its highest dynamic. Its \"horrors\" are a cheap price to pay for rescue from the only alternativesupposed, of a world of clerks and teachers, of co-education and zoophily, of \"consumer's leagues\" and ''associatedcharities,\" of industrialism unlimited, and feminism unabashed. No scorn, no hardness, no valor any more! Fie uponsuch a cattleyard of a planet!So far as the central essence of this feeling goes, no healthy minded person, it seems to me, can help to some degreepartaking of it. Militarism is the great preserver of our ideals of hardihood, and human life with no use for hardihoodwould be contemptible. Without risks or prizes for the darer, history would be insipid indeed; and there is a type ofmilitary character which every one feels that the race should never cease to breed, for every one is sensitive to itssuperiority. The duty is incumbent on mankind, of keeping military characters in stock—of keeping them, if not foruse, then as ends in themselves and as pure pieces of perfection,—so that Roosevelt's weaklings and mollycoddlesmay not end by making everything else disappear from the face of nature.This natural sort of feeling forms, I think, the innermost soul of army-writings. Without any exception known to me,militarist authors take a highly mystical view of their subject, and regard war as a biological or sociological necessity,uncontrolled by ordinary psychological checks and motives. When the time of development is ripe the war must come,reason or no reason, for the justifications pleaded are invariably fictitious. War is, in short, a permanent humanobligation. General Homer Lea, in his recent book \"the Valor of Ignorance,\" plants himself squarely on this ground.Readiness for war is for him the essence of nationality, and ability in it the supreme measure of the health of nations.Nations, General Lea says, are never stationary—they must necessarily expand or shrink, according to their vitality ordecrepitude. Japan now is culminating; and by the fatal law in question it is impossible that her statesmen should notlong since have entered, with extraordinary foresight, upon a vast policy of conquest—the game in which the firstmoves were her wars with China and Russia and her treaty with England, and of which the final objective is thecapture of the Philip-"},{"pageNumber":1355,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1286 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 50]Page 1286pines, the Hawaiian Islands, Alaska, and the whole of our Coast west of the Sierra Passes. This will give Japan whather ineluctable vocation as a state absolutely forces her to claim, the possession of the entire Pacific Ocean; and tooppose these deep designs we Americans have, according to our author, nothing but our conceit, our ignorance, ourcommercialism, our corruption, and our feminism. General Lea makes a minute technical comparison of the militarystrength which we at present could oppose to the strength of Japan, and concludes that the islands, Alaska, Oregon,and Southern California, would fall almost without resistance, that San Francisco must surrender in a fortnight to aJapanese investment, that in three or four months the war would be over, and our republic, unable to regain what ithad heedlessly neglected to protect sufficiently, would then \"disintegrate,\" until perhaps some Caesar should arise toweld us again into a nation.A dismal forecast indeed! Yet not unplausible, if the mentality of Japan's statesmen be of the Caesarian type of whichhistory shows so many examples, and which is all that General Lea seems able to imagine. But there is no reason tothink that women can no longer be the mothers of Napoleonic or Alexandrian characters; and if these come in Japanand find their opportunity, just such surprises as \"the Valor of Ignorance\" paints may lurk in ambush for us. Ignorantas we still are of the innermost recesses of Japanese mentality, we may be foolhardy to disregard such possibilities.Other militarists are more complex and more moral in their considerations. The \"Philosophie des Krieges,\" by S. R.Steinmetz is a good example. War, according to this author, is an ordeal instituted by God, who weighs the nations inits balance. It is the essential form of the State, and the only function in which peoples can employ all their powers atonce and convergently. No victory is possible save as the resultant of a totality of virtues, no defeat for which somevice or weakness is not responsible. Fidelity, cohesiveness, tenacity, heroism, conscience, education, inventiveness,economy, wealth, physical health and vigor—there isn't a moral or intellectual point of superiority that doesn't tell,when God holds his assizes and hurls the peoples upon one another.

No ordeal is comparable to its winnowings. Its dread hammer is the welder of men into cohesive states, andnowhere but in such states can human nature adequately develop its capacity. The only alternative is \"degeneration.\"Dr. Steinmetz is a conscientious thinker, and his book, short as it is, takes much into account. Its upshot can, it seemsto me, be summed up in Simon Patten's word, that mankind was nursed in pain and fear, and that the transition to a\"pleasure-economy\" may be fatal to a being wielding no powers of defense against its disintegrative influences. If wespeak of the fear of emancipation from the fear-regime, we put the whole situation into a single phrase; fear regardingourselves now taking the place of the ancient fear of the enemy.Turn the fear over as I will in my mind, it all seems to lead back to two unwillingnesses of the imagination, oneaesthetic, and the other moral: unwillingness, first to envisage a future in which army-life, with its many elements ofcharm, shall be forever impossible, and in which the destinies of peoples shall nevermore be decided quickly,thrillingly, and tragically, by force, but only gradually and insipidly by \"evolution\"; and, secondly, unwillingness tosee the supreme theatre of human strenuousness closed, and the splendid military aptitudes of men doomed to keepalways in a state of latency and never show themselves in action. These insistent unwillingnesses, no less than otheresthetic and ethical insistencies have, it seems to me, to be listened to and respected. One cannot meet themeffectively by mere counter-insistency on war's expensiveness and horror. The horror makes the thrill; and when thequestion is of getting the extremest and supremest out of human nature, talk of expense sounds ignominious. Theweakness of so much merely negative criticism is evident—pacificism makes no converts from the military party. Themilitary party denies neither the bestiality nor the horror, nor the expense; it only says that these things tell but half the"},{"pageNumber":1357,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1288 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 53]Page 1288story. It only says that war is worth them; that, taking human nature as a whole, its wars are its best protection againstits weaker and more cowardly self, and that mankind cannot afford to adopt a peace-economy.Pacificists ought to enter more deeply into the esthetical and ethical point of view of their opponents. Do that first inany controversy, says J. J. Chapman, then move the point, and your opponent will follow. So long as anti-militaristspropose no substitute for war's disciplinary function, no moral equivalent of war, analogous, as one might say, to themechanical equivalent of heat, so long they fail to realize the full inwardness of the situation. And as a rule they dofail. The duties, penalties, and sanctions pictured in the utopias they paint are all too weak and tame to touch themilitary-minded. Tolstoy's pacificism is the only exception to this rule, for it is profoundly pessimistic as regards allthis world's values, and makes the fear of the Lord furnish the moral spur provided elsewhere by the fear of theenemy. But our socialistic peace-advocates all believe absolutely in this world's values; and instead of the fear of theLord and the fear of the enemy, the only fear they reckon with is the fear of poverty if one be lazy. This weaknesspervades all the socialistic literature with which I am acquainted. Even in Lowes Dickinson's exquisite dialogue,1 highwages and short hours are the only forces invoked for overcoming man's distaste for repulsive kinds of labor.Meanwhile men at large still live as they always have lived, under a pain-and-fear economy—for those of us who livein an ease-economy are but an island in the stormy ocean—and the whole atmosphere of present-day utopianliterature tastes mawkish and dishwatery to people who still keep a sense for life's more bitter flavors. It suggests, intruth, ubiquitous inferiority.Inferiority is always with us, and merciless scorn of it is the keynote of the military temper. \"Dogs, would you liveforever?\" shouted Frederick the Great. \"Yes,\" say our utopians, \"let us live forever, and raise our level gradually.\" Thebest thing about our \"inferiors\" to-day is that they are as tough as nails, and physically and morally almost asinsensitive.

All thequalities of a man acquire dignity when he knows that the service of the collectivity that owns him needs them. Ifproud of the collectivity, his own pride rises in proportion. No collectivity is like an army for nourishing such pride;but it has to be confessed that the only sentiment which the image of pacific cosmopolitan industrialism is capable ofarousing in countless worthy breasts is shame at the idea of belonging to such a collectivity. It is obvious that theUnited States of America as they exist to-day impress a mind like General Lea's as so much human blubber. Where isthe sharpness and precipitousness, the contempt for life, whether one's own, or another's? Where is the savage \"yes\"and \"no,\" the unconditional duty? Where is the conscription? Where is the blood-tax? Where is anything that onefeels honored by belonging to?Having said thus much in preparation, I will now confess my own utopia. I devoutly believe in the reign of peace andin the gradual advent of some sort of a socialistic equilibrium. The fatalistic view of the war-function is to menonsense, for I know that war-making is due to definite motives and subject to prudential checks and reasonablecriticisms, just like any other form of enterprise. And when whole nations are the armies, and the science ofdestruction vies in intellectual refinement with the sciences of production, I see that war becomes absurd andimpossible from its own monstrosity. Extravagant ambitions will have to be replaced by reasonable claims, andnations must make common cause against them. I see no reason why all this should not apply to yellow as well as towhite countries, and I look forward to a future when acts of war shall be formally outlawed as between civilizedpeoples.All these beliefs of mine put me squarely into the anti-militarist party. But I do not believe that peace either ought tobe or will be permanent on this globe, unless the states pacifically organized preserve some of the old elements ofarmy-discipline.

We must make new energies and hardihoodscontinue the manliness to which the military mind so faithfully clings. Martial virtues must be the enduring cement;intrepidity, contempt of softness, surrender of private interest, obedience to command, must still remain the rock uponwhich states are built—unless, indeed, we wish for dangerous reactions against commonwealths fit only for contempt,and liable to invite attack whenever a centre of crystallization for military-minded enterprise gets formed anywhere intheir neighborhood.The war-party is assuredly right in affirming and reaffirming that the martial virtues, although originally gained by therace through war, are absolute and permanent human goods. Patriotic pride and ambition in their military form are,after all, only specifications of a more general competitive passion. They are its first form, but that is no reason forsupposing them to be its last form. Men now are proud of belonging to a conquering nation, and without a murmurthey lay down their persons and their wealth, if by so doing they may fend off subjection. But who can be sure thatother aspects of one's country may not, with time and education and suggestion enough, come to be regarded withsimilarly effective feelings of pride and shame? Why should men not some day feel that it is worth a blood-tax tobelong to a collectivity superior in any ideal respect? Why should they not blush with indignant shame if thecommunity that owns them is vile in any way whatsoever? Individuals, daily more numerous, now feel this civicpassion. It is only a question of blowing on the spark till the whole population gets incandescent, and on the ruins ofthe old morals of military honour, a stable system of morals of civic honour builds itself up. What the wholecommunity comes to believe in grasps the individual as in a vise. The war-function has graspt us so far; butconstructive interests may some day seem no less imperative, and impose on the individual a hardly lighter burden.Let me illustrate my idea more concretely. There is nothing to make one indignant in the mere fact that life is hard,that"},{"pageNumber":1360,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1291 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 55]Page 1291men should toil and suffer pain. The planetary conditions once for all are such, and we can stand it. But that so manymen, by mere accidents of birth and opportunity, should have a life of nothing else but toil and pain and hardness andinferiority imposed upon them, should have no vacation, while others natively no more deserving never get any tasteof this campaigning life at all,—this is capable of arousing indignation in reflective minds. It may end by seemingshameful to all of us that some of us have nothing but campaigning, and others nothing but unmanly ease. If now—and this is my idea—there were, instead of military conscription a conscription of the whole youthful population toform for a certain number of years a part of the army enlisted against Nature, the injustice would tend to be evenedout, and numerous other goods to the commonwealth would follow. The military ideals of hardihood and disciplinewould be wrought into the growing fibre of the people; no one would remain blind as the luxurious classes now areblind, to man's real relations to the globe he lives on, and to the permanently sour and hard foundations of his higherlife. To coal and iron mines, to freight trains, to fishing fleets in December, to dish-washing, clothes-washing, andwindow-washing, to road-building and tunnel-making, to foundries and stoke-holes, and to the frames of skyscrapers,would our gilded youths be drafted off, according to their choice, to get the childishness knocked out of them, and tocome back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas. They would have paid their blood-tax, done theirown part in the immemorial human warfare against nature, they would tread the earth more proudly, the women wouldvalue them more highly, they would be better fathers and teachers of the following generation.Such a conscription, with the state of public opinion that would have required it, and the many moral fruits it wouldbear, would preserve in the midst of a pacific civilization the manly virtues which the military party is so afraid ofseeing disappear in peace. We should get toughness without callousness, authority with as little criminal cruelty aspossible, and painful work done cheerily because the duty is temporary, and threatens not, as now, to degrade thewhole remainder of"},{"pageNumber":1361,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1292 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 56]Page 1292one's life. I spoke of the \"moral equivalent\" of war. So far, war has been the only force that can discipline a wholecommunity, and until an equivalent discipline is organized, I believe that war must have its way. But I have noserious doubt that the ordinary prides and shames of social man, once developed to a certain intensity, are capable oforganizing such a moral equivalent as I have sketched, or some other just as effective for preserving manliness oftype. It is but a question of time, of skillful propagandism, and of opinion-making men seizing historic opportunities.The martial type of character can be bred without war. Strenuous honour and disinterestedness abound elsewhere.Priests and medical men are in a fashion educated to it, and we should all feel some degree of it imperative if we wereconscious of our work as an obligatory service to the state. We should be owned, as soldiers are by the army, and ourpride would rise accordingly. We could be poor, then, without humiliation, as army officers now are. The only thingneeded henceforward is to inflame the civic temper as past history has inflamed the military temper. H. G. Wells, asusual, sees the centre of the situation. \"In many ways,\" he says, \"military organization is the most peaceful ofactivities. When the contemporary man steps from the street, of clamorous insincere advertisement, push, adulteration,underselling and intermittent employment, into the barrack-yard, he steps on to a higher social plane, into anatmosphere of service and cooperation and of infinitely more honourable emulations. Here at least men are not flungout of employment to degenerate because there is no immediate work for them to do. They are fed and drilled andtrained for better services. Here at least a man is supposed to win promotion by self-forgetfulness and not by self-seeking. And beside the feeble and irregular endowment of research by commercialism, its little short-sightedsnatches at profit by innovation and scientific economy, see how remarkable is the steady and rapid development ofmethod and appliances in naval and military affairs! Nothing is more striking than to compare the progress of civilconveniences which has been left almost entirely to the trader, to the progress in military apparatus during the last fewdecades. The house-appliances of to-day for example,"},{"pageNumber":1362,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1293 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 56]Page 1293are little better than they were fifty years ago. A house of today is still almost as ill-ventilated, badly heated bywasteful fires, clumsily arranged and furnished as the house of 1858. Houses a couple of hundred years old are stillsatisfactory places of residence, so little have our standards risen. But the rifle or battleship of fifty years ago wasbeyond all comparison inferior to those we possess; in power, in speed, in convenience alike. No one has a use nowfor such superannuated things.\"1Wells adds2 that he thinks that the conceptions of order and discipline, the tradition of service and devotion, ofphysical fitness, unstinted exertion, and universal responsibility, which universal military duty is now teachingEuropean nations, will remain a permanent acquisition, when the last ammunition has been used in the fireworks thatcelebrate the final peace. I believe as he does. It would be simply preposterous if the only force that could work idealsof honour and standards of efficiency into English or American natures should be the fear of being killed by theGermans or the Japanese. Great indeed is Fear; but it is not, as our military enthusiasts believe and try to make usbelieve, the only stimulus known for awakening the higher ranges of men's spiritual energy. The amount of alterationin public opinion which my utopia postulates is vastly less than the difference between the mentality of those blackwarriors who pursued Stanley's party on the Congo with their cannibal war-cry of \"Meat! Meat\" and that of the\"general-staff\" of any civilized nation. History has seen the latter interval bridged over: the former one can be bridgedover much more easily.1First and Last Things, 1908, p. 215.2Ibid., p. 226.Association for International Conciliation: Leaflet No. 27,February 1910"},{"pageNumber":1363,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1294 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 57]Page 1294A Pluralistic MysticNot for the ignoble vulgar do I write this article, but only for those dialectic-mystic souls who have an irresistibletaste, acquired or native, for higher flights of metaphysics. I have always held the opinion that one of the first dutiesof a good reader is to summon other readers to the enjoyment of any unknown author of rare quality whom he maydiscover in his explorations. Now for years my own taste, literary as well as philosophic, has been exquisitelytitillated by a writer the name of whom I think must be unknown to the readers of this article; so I no longer continuesilent about the merits of BENJAMIN PAUL BLOODM.Mr Blood inhabits a city otherwise, I imagine, quite unvisited by the Muses, the town called Amsterdam, situated onthe New York Central Railroad. What his regular or bread-winning occupation may be I know not, but it can't havemade him super-wealthy. He is an author only when the fit strikes him, and for short spurts at a time; shy, moreover,to the point of publishing his compositions only as private tracts, or in letters to such far-from-reverberant organs ofpublicity as the Gazette or the Recorder of his native Amsterdam, or the Utica Herald or the Albany Times. Oddplaces for such subtile efforts to appear in, but creditable to American editors in these degenerate days! Once, indeed,the lamented W. T. Harris of the old Journal of Speculative Philosophy got wind of these epistles, and the result was arevision of some of them for that review (\"Philosophic Reveries,\" 1889). Also a couple of poems were reprinted fromtheir leaflets by the editor of Scribner's Magazine (\"The Lion of the Nile,\" 1888, and \"Nemesis,\" 1899). But apartfrom these three dashes before the footlights, Mr Blood has kept behind the curtain all his days.1The author's maiden adventure was the An sthetic Reve-1\"Yes! Paul is quite a correspondent!\" said a good critizen of Amsterdam, from whom I inquired the way to Mr Blood's dwelling manyyears ago, after alighting from the train. I had sought to identify him by calling him an \"author,\" but his neighbour thought of him onlyas a writer of letters to the journals I have named."},{"pageNumber":1364,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1295 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 58]Page 1295lation, a pamphlet printed privately at Amsterdam in 1874. I forget how it fell into my hands, but it fascinated me so''weirdly\" that I am conscious of its having been one of the stepping-stones of my thinking ever since. It gives theessence of Blood's philosophy, and shows most of the features of his talent—albeit one finds in it little humour and noverse. It is full of verbal felicity, felicity sometimes of precision, sometimes of metaphoric reach; it begins withdialectic reasoning, of an extremely Fichtean and Hegelian type, but it ends in a trumpet-blast of oracular mysticism,straight from the insight wrought by anæsthetics—of all things in the world—and unlike anything one ever heardbefore. The practically unanimous tradition of \"regular\" mysticism has been unquestionably monistic; and inasmuchas it is the characteristic of mystics to speak, not as the scribes, but as men who have \"been there\" and seen with theirown eyes, I think that this sovereign manner must have made some other pluralistic-minded students hesitate, as Iconfess that it has often given pause to me. One cannot criticise the vision of a mystic—one can but pass it by, or elseaccept it as having some amount of evidential weight. I felt unable to do either with a good conscience until I metwith Mr Blood. His mysticism, which may, if one likes, be understood as monistic in this earlier utterance, developsin the later ones a sort of \"left-wing\" voice of defiance, and breaks into what to my ear has a radically pluralisticsound. I confess that the existence of this novel brand of mysticism has made my cowering mood depart. I feel now asif my own pluralism were not without the kind of support which mystical corroboration may confer. Monism can nolonger claim to be the only beneficiary of whatever right mysticism may possess to lend prestige.This is my philosophic, as distinguished from my literary interest, in introducing Mr Blood to this more fashionableaudience: his philosophy, however mystical, is in the last resort not dissimilar from my own. I must treat him by\"extracting\" him, and simplify—certainly all too violently—as I extract. He is not consecutive as a writer, aphoristicand oracular rather; and being moreover sometimes dialectic, sometimes poetic, and sometimes mystic in his manner,sometimes monistic and sometimes pluralistic in his matter, I have to run"},{"pageNumber":1365,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1296 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 58]Page 1296my own risk in making him orate pro domo mea, and I am not quite unprepared to hear him say, in case he ever readsthese pages, that I have entirely missed his point. No matter; I will proceed.II will separate his diverse phases and take him first as a pure dialectician. Dialectic thought of the Hegelian type is awhirlpool into which some persons are sucked out of the stream which the straightforward understanding follows.Once in the eddy, nothing but rotary motion can go on. All who have been in it know the feel of its swirl—they knowthenceforward that thinking unreturning on itself is but one part of reason, and that rectilinear mentality, in philosophyat any rate, will never do. Though each one may report in different words of his rotational experience, the experienceitself is almost childishly simple, and whosoever has been there instantly recognises other authentic reports. To havebeen in that eddy is a freemasonry of which the common password is a \"fie\" on all the operations of the simplepopular understanding.In Hegel's mind the vortex was at its liveliest, and any one who has dipped into Hegel will recognise Mr Blood to beof the same tribe. \"That Hegel was pervaded by the great truth,\" Blood writes, \"cannot be doubted. The eyes ofphilosophy, if not set directly on him, are set towards the region which he occupied. Though he may not be the finalphilosopher, yet pull him out, and all the rest will be drawn into his vacancy.\"Drawn into the same whirlpool, Mr Blood means. Nondialectic thought takes facts as singly given, and accounts forone fact by another. But when we think of \"all fact,\" we see that nothing of the nature of fact can explain it, \"for thatwere but one more added to the list of things to be accounted for. The beginning of curiosity, in the philosophicsense,\" Mr Blood again writes, \"is the stare of being at itself, in the wonder why anything is at all, and what this beingsignifies. Naturally we first assume the void, and then wonder how, with no ground and no fertility, anything shouldcome into it.'' We treat it as a positive nihility, \"a barrier from which all our batted balls of being rebound.\""},{"pageNumber":1366,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1297 hl[01 03 2011 21 22 59]Page 1297Upon this idea Mr Blood passes the usual transcendentalist criticism. There is no such separate opposite to being; yetwe never think of being as such—of pure being as distinguished from specific forms of being—save as what standsrelieved against this imaginary background. Being has no outline but that which non-being makes, and the two ideasform an inseparable pair. \"Each limits and defines the other. Either would be the other in the same position, for here(where there is as yet no question of content, but only of being itself) the position is all and the content is nothing.Hence arose that paradox: 'Being is by nothing more real than not-being.'\"\"Popularly,\" Mr Blood goes on, \"we think of all that is as having got the better of non-being. If all were not—that, wethink, were easy: there were no wonder then, no tax on ingenuity, nothing to be accounted for. This conclusion is fromthe thinking which assumes all reality as immediately given, assumes knowledge as a simple physical light, ratherthan as a distinction involving light and darkness equally. We assume that if the light were to go out, the show wouldbe ended (and so it would); but we forget that if the darkness were to go out, that would be equally calamitous. It werebad enough if the master had lost his crayon, but the loss of the black-board would be just as fatal to thedemonstration. Without darkness light would be useless—universal light as blind as universal darkness. Universalthing and universal no-thing were indistinguishable. Why, then, assume the positive, the immediately affirmative, asalone the ingenious? Is not the mould as shapely as the model? The original ingenuity does not show in bringing lightout of darkness, nor in bringing things out of nothing, but in evolving, through the just opposition of light anddarkness, this wondrous picture, in which the black and white lines have equal significance—in evolving from lifeand death at once, the conscious spirit. \"It is our habit to think of life as dear, and of death as cheap (though Tithonus found them otherwise), or, continuingthe simile of the picture, that paper is cheap while drawing is expensive; but the engraver had a different estimation inone sense, for all his labour was spent on the white ground, while he left untouched those parts of the block whichmake"},{"pageNumber":1367,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1298 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 00]Page 1298the lines in the picture. If being and non-being are both necessary to the presence of either, neither shall claim priorityor preference. Indeed, we may fancy an intelligence which, instead of regarding things as simply owning entity,should regard chiefly their background as affected by the holes which things are making in it. Even so, the paper-maker might see your picture as intrusive!\"Thus \"does the negation of being appear as indispensable in the making of it.\" But to anyone who should appeal toparticular forms of being to refute this paradox, Mr Blood admits that \"to say that a picture, or any other sensuousthing, is the same as the want of it, were to utter nonsense indeed: there is a difference equivalent to the whole stuffand merit of the picture; but in so far as the picture can be there for thought, as something either asserted or negated,its presence or its absence are the same and indifferent. By its absence we do not mean the absence of anything else,nor absence in general; and how, forsooth, does its absence differ from these other absences, save by containing acomplete description of the picture? The hole is as round as the plug; and from our thought the 'picture' cannot getaway. The negation is specific and descriptive, and what it destroys it preserves for our conception.\"The result is that, whether it be taken generally or taken specifically, all that which either is or is not is or is not bydistinction or opposition. \"And observe the life, the process, through which this slippery doubleness endures. Let ussuppose the present tense, that gods and men and angels and devils march all abreast in this present instant, and theonly real time and date in the universe is now. And what is this instant now? Whatever else, it is process—becomingand departing; with what between? Simply division, difference; the present has no breadth, for if it had, that which weseek would be the middle of that breadth. There is no precipitate, as on a stationary platform, of the process ofbecoming, no residuum of the process of departing, but between the two is a curtain, the apparition of difference,which is all the world.\"I am using my scissors somewhat at random on my author's paragraphs, since one place is as good as another for"},{"pageNumber":1368,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1299 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 00]Page 1299entering a ring by, and the expert reader will discern at once the authentic dialectic circling. Other paragraphs showMr Blood as more Hegelian still, and thoroughly idealistic:—\"Assume that knowing is distinguishing, and that distinction is of difference; if one knows a difference, one knows itas of entities which afford it, and which also he knows; and he must know the entities and the difference apart—onefrom the other. Knowing all this, he should be able to answer the twin question, 'What is the difference betweensameness and difference?' It is a 'twin' question, because the two terms are equal in the proposition, and each is full ofthe other. \"Sameness has 'all the difference in the world'—from difference; and difference is an entity as difference—it beingidentically that. They are alike and different at once, since either is the other when the observer would contrast it withthe other—so that the sameness and the difference are 'subjective,' are the property of the observer: his is the 'limit' intheir unlimited field. \"We are thus apprised that distinction involves and carries its own identity; and that ultimate distinction—distinctionin the last analysis—is self-distinction—'self-knowledge,' as we realise it consciously every day. Knowledge is self-referred: to know is to know that of you know, and to be known as well.\"'Ah! but both in the same time?' inquires the logician. A subject-object knowing itself as a seamless unit, while yetits two items show a real distinction: this passes all understanding.\"But the whole of idealism goes to the proof that the two sides cannot succeed one another in a time-process. \"To sayyou know, and you know that you know, is to add nothing in the last clause; it is as idle as to say that you lie, and youknow that you lie,\" for if you know it not you lie not.Philosophy seeks to grasp totality, \"but the power of grasping or consenting to totality involves the power of thoughtto make itself its own object. Totality itself may indeed be taken by the naïve intellect as an immediate topic, in thesense of being just an object, but it cannot be just that; for the knower, as other or opposite, would still be within thattotality. The 'universe' by definition must contain all opposition."},{"pageNumber":1369,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1300 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 01]Page 1300If distinction should vanish, what would remain? To what other could it change as a whole? How can the loss ofdistinction make a difference? Any loss, at its utmost, offers a new status with the old, but obviously it is too late nowto efface distinction by a change. There is no possible conjecture, but such as carries with it the subjective that holdsit; and when the conjecture is of distinction in general, the subjective fills the void with distinction of itself. Theultimate, ineffaceable distinction is self-distinction, self-consciousness. 'Thou art the unanswered question, couldstsee thy proper eye.' . The thought that must be is the very thought of our experience; the ultimate opposition, the to beand not to be, is personality, spirit—somewhat that is in knowing that it is, and is nothing else but this knowing in itsvast relations.1\"Here lies the bed-rock; here the brain-sweat of twenty-five centuries crystallises to a jewel five words long: 'THEUNIVERSE HAS NO OPPOSITE.' For there the wonder of that which is, rests safe in the perception that all thingsare only through the opposition which is their only fear.\"\"The inevitable generally,\" in short, is exactly and identically that which in point of fact is actually here.This is the familiar nineteenth-century development of Kant's idealistic vision. To me it sounds monistic enough to1\"How shall a man know he is alive—since in thought the knowing constitutes the being alive, without knowing that thought (life) fromits opposite, and so knowing both, and so far as being is knowing, being both? Each defines and relieves the other, each is impossible inthought without the other; therefore each has no distinction save as presently contrasting with the other, and each by itself is the same, andnothing. Clearly, then, consciousness is neither of one nor of the other nor of the both, but a knowing subject perceiving them and itselftogether and as one. So, in coming out of the anæsthetic exhilaration . we want to tell something; but the effort instantly proves thatsomething will stay back and do the telling—one must utter one's own throat, one must eat one's own teeth, to express the being thatpossesses one. The result is ludicrous and astounding at once—astounding in the clear perception that this is the ultimate mystery of life,and is given you as the old Adamic secret, which you then feel that all intelligence must sometimes know or have known; yet ludicrous inits familiar simplicity, as somewhat that any man should always perceive at his best, if his head were only level, but which in ourordinary thinking has grown into a thousand creeds and theories dignified as religion and philosophy.\""},{"pageNumber":1370,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1301 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 02]Page 1301charm the monist in me unreservedly. I listen to the felicitously-worded concept-music circling round itself, as onsome drowsy summer noon one listens under the pines to the murmuring of leaves and insects, and with as littlethought of criticism.But Mr Blood strikes a still more vibrant note: \"No more can be than rationally is; and this was always true. There isno reason for what is not; but for what there is reason, that is and ever was. Especially is there no becoming of reason,and hence no reason for becoming, to a sufficient intelligence. In the sufficient intelligence all things always are, andare rational. To say there is something yet to be which never was, not even in the sufficient intelligence wherein theworld is rational and not a blind and orphan waif, is to ignore all reason. Aught that might be assumed as contingentlycoming to be could only have 'freedom' for its origin; and 'freedom' has not fertility or invention, and is not a reasonfor any special thing, but the very vacuity of a ground for anything in preference to its room. Neither is there in baretime any principle or originality whereby anything should come or go. \"Such idealism ensures greatly to the dignity and repose of man. No blind fate, prior to what is, shall necessitate thatall first be and afterward be known, but knowledge is first, with fate in her own hands. When we are depressed by theweight and immensity of the immediate, we find in idealism a wondrous consolation. The alien positive, so vast andoverwhelming by itself, reduces its pretensions when the whole negative confronts it on our side.1 It matters little forits greatness when an equal greatness is opposed. When one remembers that the balance and motion of the planets areso delicate that the momentary scowl of an eclipse may fill the heavens with tempest, and even affect the very bowelsof the earth—when we see a balloon, that carries perhaps a thousand pounds, leap up a hundred feet at the dischargeof a sheet of note paper—1Elsewhere Mr Blood writes of the \"force of the negative\" thus:—\"As when a faded lock of woman's hair shall cause a man to cut histhroat in a bedroom at five o'clock in the morning; or when Albany resounds with legislation, but a little henpecked judge in a dustyoffice at Herkimer or Johnstown sadly writes across the page the word 'unconstitutional'—and the glory of the Capitol has faded.\""},{"pageNumber":1371,"pageContent":" Page 1302or feel it stand deathly still in a hurricane, because it goes with the hurricane, sides with it, and ignores the rushingworld below—we should realise that one title of pure originality would outweigh this crass objective, and turn thesevast masses into mere breath and tissue-paper show.\"1But whose is the originality? There is nothing in what I am treating as this phase of our author's thought to separate itfrom the old-fashioned rationalism. There must be a reason for every fact; and so much reason, so fact. The reason isalways the whole foil and background and negation of the fact, the whole remainder of reality. \"A man may feel goodonly by feeling better. Pleasure is ever in the company and contrast of pain; for instance, in thirsting and drinking, thepleasure of the one is the exact measure of the pain of the other, and they cease precisely together—otherwise thepatient would drink more. The black and yellow gonfalon of Lucifer is indispensable in any spiritual picture.\" Thus dotruth's two components seem to balance, vibrating across the centre of indifference; \"being and non-being have equalvalue and cost,\" and \"mainly are convertible in their terms.\"2This sounds radically monistic; and monistic also is the first1Elsewhere Blood writes:—\"But what then, in the name of common sense, is the external world? If a dead man could answer he wouldsay Nothing, or as Macbeth said of the air-drawn dagger, 'there is no such thing.' But a live man's answer might be in this way: What isthe multiplication table when it is not written down? It is a necessity of thought; it was not created, it cannot but be; every intelligencewhich goes to it, and thinks, must think in that form or think falsely. So the universe is the static necessity of reason; it is not an objectfor any intelligence to find, but it is half object and half subject; it never cost anything as a whole; it never was made, but always ismade, in the Logos, or expression of reason—the Word; and slowly but surely it will be understood and uttered in every intelligence,until he is one with God or reason itself. As a man, for all he knows, or has known, stands at any given instant the realisation of only onethought, while all the rest of him is invisibly linked to that in the necessary form and concatenation of reason, so the man as a whole ofexploited thoughts is a moment in the front of the concatenated reason of the universal whole; and this whole is personal only as it ispersonally achieved. This is the Kingdom that is 'within you,' and the God which 'no man hath seen at any time.'\"2There are passages in Blood that sound like a well-known essay by Emerson. For instance:—\"Experience burns into us the fact and thenecessity of universal compensation. The philosopher takes it from Heraclitus, in the insight that everything exists through its opposite; andthe bummer comforts(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":1372,"pageContent":" Page 1303account of the Ether-revelation, in which we read that \"thenceforth each is all, in God. The One remains, the manychange and pass; and every one of us is the One that remains.\"IIIt seems to me that any transcendental idealist who reads this article ought to discern in the fragmentary utteranceswhich I have quoted thus far, the note of what he considers the truer dialectic profundity. He ought to extend the gladhand of fellowship to Mr Blood; and if he finds him afterwards palavering with the enemy, he ought to count him, notas a simple ignoramus or Philistine, but as a renegade and relapse. He cannot possibly be treated as one who sinsbecause he never has known better, or as one who walks in darkness because he is congenitally blind.Well, Mr Blood, explain it as one may, does turn towards the darkness as if he had never seen the light. Just listen fora moment to such irrationalist deliverances on his part as these:—\"Reason is neither the first nor the last word in this world. Reason is an equation; it gives but a pound for a pound.Nature is excess; she is evermore, without cost or explanation.'Is heaven so poor that justiceMetes the bounty of the skies?So poor that every blessing(Footnote continued from previous page)himself for his morning headache as only the rough side of a square deal.

'Though He slay me, yet will I trust inHim.'\"This is the faith that baffles all calamity, and ensures genius and patience in the world.

Or is it only dialectic circling,like the opposite points on the rim of a revolving disc, one moving up, one down, but replacing one another endlessly,while the whole disc never moves?

Earth was my lair:I slept on the red desert without fear:I roamed the jungle depths with less designThan e'en to lord their solitude; on cragsThat cringe from lightning—black and blasted frontsThat crouch beneath the wind-bleared stars, I toldMy heart's fruition to the universe,And all night long, roaring my fierce defy,I thrilled the wilderness with aspen terrors,And challenged death and life. \"Again:\"Naked I stood upon the raked arenaBeneath the pennants of Vespasian,While seried thousands gazed—strangers from Caucasus,Men of the Grecian Isles, and Barbary princes,To see me grapple with the counterpartOf that I had been—the raptorial jaws,The arms that wont to crush with strength alone,The eyes that glared vindictive.—Fallen there,Vast wings upheaved me; from the Alpine peaksWhose avalanches swirl the valley mistsAnd whelm the helpless cottage, to the crownOf Chimborazo, on whose changeless jewelsThe torrid rays recoil, with ne'er a cloudTo swathe their blistered steps, I rested not,But preyed on all that ventured from the earth,An outlaw of the heavens.—But evermoreMust death release me to the jungle shades;"},{"pageNumber":1375,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1306 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 05]Page 1306And there like Samson's grew my locks againIn the old walks and ways, till scapeless fateWon me as ever to the haunts of men,Luring my lives with battle and with love.'' I quote less than a quarter of the poem, of which the rest is just as good, and I ask: Who of us all handles his Englishvocabulary better than Mr Blood?1His proclamations of the mystic insight have a similar verbal power:—\"There is an invariable and reliable condition (or uncondition) ensuing about the instant of recall from anæstheticstupor to 'coming to,' in which the genius of being is revealed. No words may express the imposing certainty of thepatient that he is realising the primordial Adamic surprise of Life.\"Repetition of the experience finds it ever the same, and as if it could not possibly be otherwise. The subject resumeshis normal consciousness only to partially and fitfully remember its occurrence, and to try to formulate its bafflingimport,—with but this consolatory afterthought: that he has known the oldest truth, and that he has done with humantheories as to the origin, meaning, or destiny of the race. He is beyond instruction in 'spiritual things.' .\"It is the instant contrast of this 'tasteless water of souls' with formal thought as we 'come to,' that leaves in the patientan astonishment that the awful mystery of Life is at last but a homely and a common thing, and that aside from merefor-1Or what thinks the reader of the verbiage of these verses?—addressed in a mood of human defiance to the cosmic Gods—\"Whose lightnings tawny leap from furtive lairs,To helpless murder, while the ships go downSwirled in the crazy stound, and mariners' prayersGo up in noisome bubbles—such to them;—Or when they tramp about the central fires,Bending the strata with æonian treadTill steeples totter, and all ways are lost,—Deem they of wife or child, or home or friend,Doing these things as the long years lead onOnly to other years that mean no more,That cure no ill, nor make for use or proof—Destroying ever, though to rear again.\""},{"pageNumber":1376,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1307 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 05]Page 1307mality the majestic and the absurd are of equal dignity. The astonishment is aggravated as at a thing of course, missedby sanity in overstepping, as in too foreign a search, or with too eager an attention: as in finding one's spectacles onone's nose, or in making in the dark a step higher than the stair. My first experiences of this revelation had manyvarieties of emotion; but as a man grows calm and determined by experience in general, so am I now not only firmand familiar in this once weird condition, but triumphant—divine. To minds of sanguine imagination there will be asadness in the tenor of the mystery, as if the key-note of the universe were low, for no poetry, no emotion known tothe normal sanity of man, can furnish a hint of its primeval prestige, and its all-but appalling solemnity; but for suchas have felt sadly the instability of temporal things there is a comfort of serenity and ancient peace, while for theresolved and imperious spirit there are majesty and supremacy unspeakable. Nor can it be long until all who enter theanæsthetic condition (and there are hundreds every secular day) will be taught to expect this revelation, and will datefrom its experience their initiation into the Secret of Life.&hhellip;.\"This has been my moral sustenance since I have known of it. In my first printed mention of it I declared: 'The worldis no more the alien terror that was taught me. Spurning the cloud-grimed and still sultry battlements whence so latelyJehovan thunders boomed, my grey gull lifts her wing against the nightfall, and takes the dim leagues with a fearlesseye.' And now, after twenty-seven years of this experience, the wing is greyer, but the eye is fearless still, while Irenew and doubly emphasise that declaration. I know, as having known, the meaning of Existence; the sane centre ofthe universe—at once the wonder and the assurance of the soul.\"After this rather literary interlude I return to Blood's philosophy again. I spoke a while ago of its being an\"irrationalistic\" philosophy in its latest phase. Behind every \"fact\" rationalism postulates its \"reason.'' Blood parodizesthis demand in true nominalistic fashion. \"The goods are not enough, but they must have the invoice with them. Theremust be a name, something to read. I think of Dickens's horse"},{"pageNumber":1377,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1308 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 06]Page 1308that always fell down when they took him out of the shafts; or of the fellow who felt weak when naked, but strong inhis overcoat.\"—No bad mockery, this, surely, of rationalism's habit of explaining things by putting verbal doubles ofthem beneath them as their ground!\"All that philosophy has sought as cause, or reason,\" he says, \"pluralism subsumes in the status and the given fact,where it stands as plausible as it may ever hope to stand. There may be disease in the presence of a question as wellas in the lack of an answer. We do not wonder so strangely at an ingenious and well-set-up effect, for we feel such inourselves; but a cause, reaching out beyond the verge [of fact] and dangling its legs in nonentity, with the hope of arational foothold, should realise a strenuous life. Pluralism believes in truth and reason, but only as mysticallyrealised, as lived in experience. Up from the breast of a man, up to his tongue and brain, comes a free and strongdetermination, and he cries, originally, and in spite of his whole nature and environment, 'I will.' This is the Jovianfiat, the pure cause. This is reason; this or nothing shall explain the world for him. For how shall he entertain a reasonbigger than himself? Let a man stand fast, then, as an axis of the earth; the obsequious meridians will bow to him,and gracious latitudes will measure from his feet.\"This seems to be Blood's mystical answer to his own monistic statement which I quoted above, that \"freedom\" has nofertility, and is no reason for any special thing.1 \"Philosophy,\"1I subjoin a poetic apostrophe of Mr Blood's to freedom:\"Let it ne'er be known.If in some book of the Inevitable,Dog-eared and stale, the future stands engrossedE'en as the past. There shall be news in heaven,And question in the courts thereof; and chanceShall have its fling, e'en at the [ermined] bench.Ah, long ago, above the Indian ocean,Where wan stars brood over the dreaming East,I saw, white, liquid, palpitant, the Cross;And faint and far came bells of CalvaryAs planets passed, singing that they were saved,Saved from themselves: but ever low Orion—For hunter too was I, born of the wild,(Footnote continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":1378,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1309 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 06]Page 1309Mr Blood writes to me in a letter, \"is past. It was the long endeavour to logicise what we can only realise practicallyor in immediate experience. I am more and more impressed that Heraclitus insists on the equation of reason andunreason, or chance, as well as of being and not-being, etc. This throws the secret beyond logic, and makes mysticismoutclass philosophy. The insight that mystery—the MYSTERY—as such is final, is the hymnic word. If you usereason pragmatically, and deny it absolutely, you can't be beaten—be assured of that. But the Fact remains, and ofcourse the Mystery.\"1(Footnote continued from previous page)And the game flavour of the infiniteTainted me to the bone—he waved me on,On to the tangent field beyond all orbs,Where form nor order nor continuanceHath thought nor name; there unity exhalesIn want of confine, and the protoplasmMay beat and beat, in aimless vehemence,Through vagrant spaces, homeless and unknown.There ends One's empire!—but so ends not all;One knows not all; my griefs at least are mine—By me their measure, and to me their lesson;E'en I am one—(poor deuce to call the Ace!)And to the open bears my gonfalon,Mine ægis, Freedom!—Let me ne'er look backAccusing, for the withered leaves and livesThe sated past hath strewn, the shears of fate,But forth to braver days.O, Liberty,Burthen of every sigh!—thou gold of gold,Beauty of the beautiful, strength of the strong!My soul for ever turns agaze for thee.There is no purpose of eternityFor faith or patience; but thy buoyant torchStill lighted from the Islands of the Blest,O'erbears all present for potential heavensWhich are not—ah, so more than all that are!Whose chance postpones the ennui of the skies!Be thou my genius—be my hope in thee!For this were heaven: to be, and to be free.\"1In another letter Mr Blood writes:—\"I think we are through with 'the Whole,' and with 'causa sui,' and with the 'negative unity' whichassumes to identify each thing as being what it lacks of everything else.

From every realisedamount of fact some other fact is absent, as being uninvolved. \"There is nowhere more of it consecutively, perhaps,than appears upon this present page.\" There is, indeed, to put it otherwise, no more one all-enveloping fact than thereis one all-enveloping spire in an endlessly growing spiral, and no more one all-generating fact than there is onecentral point in which an endlessly converging spiral ends. Hegel's \"bad infinite\" belongs to the eddy as well as to theline. ''Progress?\" writes our author. \"And to what? Time turns a weary and a wistful face; has he not traversed aneternity? and shall another give the secret up? We have dreamed of a climax and a consummation, a final triumphwhere a world shall burn enbarbecue; but there is not, cannot be, a purpose of ternity; it shall pay mainly as it goes,or not at all. The show is on; and what a show, if we will but give our attention! Barbecues, bonfires, and banners?Not twenty worlds a minute would keep up our bonfire of the sun; and what banners of our fancy could eclipse themeteor pennants of the pole, or the opaline splendours of the everlasting ice?. Doubtless we are ostensiblyprogressing, but there have been prosperity and high-jinks before. Nineveh and Tyre, Rome, Spain, and Venice alsohad their day. We are going, but it is a question of our standing the pace. It would seem that the news must becomeless interesting or tremendously more so—'a breath can make us, as a breath has made.'\"Elsewhere we read: \"Variety, not uniformity, is more likely to be the key to progress. The genius of being iswhimsical rather than consistent. Our strata show broken bones of histories all forgotten. How can it be otherwise?There can be no purpose of eternity. It is process all. The most sublime result, if it appeared as the ultimatum, wouldgo stale in an hour—it could not be endured.\"(Footnote continued from previous page)if it wasn't a sphere? What a weariness it is to look back over the twenty odd volumes of the Journal of Speculative Philosophy, and seeHarris's mind wholly filled by that one conception of self-determination—everything to be thought as 'part of a system'—a 'whole' and'causa sui.'—I should like to see such an idea get into the head of Edison or Geo.

Nothing in Hegel has kept the planet from being blown to pieces.\"Obviously the mystical \"security,\" the ''apodal sufficiency\" yielded by the anæsthetic revelation, are very differentmoods of mind from aught that rationalism can claim to father— more active, prouder, more heroic. From his etherintoxication Blood may feel towards ordinary rationalists \"as Clive felt towards those millions of Orientals in whomhonour had no part.\" On page 1303, above, I quoted from his \"Nemesis\" —\"Is heaven so poor that justice,\" etc. Thewriter goes on, addressing the goddess of \"compensation\" or rational balance:—\"How shalt thou poise the courageThat covets all things hard?How pay the love unmeasuredThat could not brook reward?How prompt self-loyal honourSupreme above desire,That bids the strong die for the weak,The martyrs sing in fire?Why do I droop in bowerAnd sigh in sacred hall?Why stifle under shelter?Yet where, through forest tall,The breath of hungry winterIn stinging spray resolves,I sing to the north wind's furyAnd shout with the coarse-haired wolves?What of thy priests' confuting,Of fate and form and law,Of being and essence and counterpoise,Of poles that drive and draw?Ever some compensation,Some pandering purchase stillBut the vehm of achieving reasonIs the all-patrician Will!\""},{"pageNumber":1381,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1312 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 08]Page 1312Mr Blood must manage to re-write the last two lines; but the contrast of the two securities, his and the rationalist's, isplain enough. The rationalist sees safe conditions. But Mr Blood's revelation, whatever the conditions be, helps him tostand ready for a life among them. In this, his attitude seems to resemble that of Nietzsche's amor fati! \"Simply,\" hewrites to me, \"we do not know. But when we say we do not know, we are not to say it weakly and meekly, but withconfidence and content. Knowledge is and must ever be secondary—a witness rather than a principal—or a'principle'!—in the case. Therefore mysticism for me!\"\"Reason,\" he prints elsewhere, \"is but an item in the duplex potency of the mystery, and behind the proudestconsciousness that ever reigned, Reason and Wonder blushed face to face. The legend sinks to burlesque if in thatgreat argument which antedates man and his mutterings, Lucifer had not a fighting chance. \"It is given to the writer and to others for whom he is permitted to speak—and we are grateful that it is the custom ofgentlemen to believe one another—that the highest thought is not a milk-and-water equation of so much reason andso much result—'no school sum to be cast up.' We have realised the highest divine thought of itself, and there is in itas much of wonder as of certainty; inevitable, and solitary and safe in one sense, but queer and cactus-like no less inanother sense, it appeals unutterably to experience alone.\"There are sadness and disenchantment for the novice in these inferences, as if the keynote of the universe were low,but experience will approve them. Certainty is the root of despair. The inevitable stales, while doubt and hope aresisters. Not unfortunately the universe is wild—game flavoured as a hawk's wing. Nature is miracle all. She knows nolaws; the same returns not, save to bring the different. The slow round of the engraver's lathe gains but the breadth ofa hair, but the difference is distributed back over the whole curve, never an instant true—ever not quite.\"\"Ever not quite!'—this seems to wring the very last panting word out of rationalistic philosophy's mouth.

In every moment of immediate experience issome-what absolutely original and novel. \"We are the first that ever burst into this silent sea.\" Philosophy must passfrom words, that reproduce but ancient elements, to life itself, that gives the integrally new. The \"inexplicable,\" the''mystery,\" as what the intellect, with its claim to reason out reality, thinks that it is in duty bound to resolve, and theresolution of which Blood's revelation would eliminate from the sphere of our duties, remains; but it remains assomething to be met and dealt with by faculties more akin to our activities and heroisms and willingnesses, than toour logical powers. This is the anæsthetic insight, according to our author. Let my last word, then, speaking in thename of intellectual philosophy, be his word:—\"There is no conclusion.

Being the Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion Delivered atEdinburgh in 1901 1902; Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking. Popular Lectures onPhilosophy; A Pluralistic Universe. Hibbert Lectures at Manchester College on the Present Situation in Philosophy;The Meaning of Truth: A Sequel to 'Pragmatism'; Some Problems of Philosophy: A Beginning of an Introduction toPhilosophy; and a selection of twenty short pieces written during that period.When James first accepted the offer of the Gifford Lectureship early in 1898, the lectures that make up The Varietiesof Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature were scheduled to be delivered in two courses of ten each at theUniversity of Edinburgh during the winters of 1899 1900 and 1900 01. By the time James sailed for Europe in July1899, the date of delivery for the first course had been changed to the late spring of 1900. Pressure of work and thenhis developing heart problems had prevented him from working on the lectures earlier, but he hoped that treatment atthe spa at Bad Nauheim would give him the strength to write again. His health continued to fail, and in December1899 he resigned the lectureship. The Gifford Committee refused his resignation, however, and on May 16, 1901,after repeated postponements and continued severe illness, James delivered his first lecture. The course was verysuccessful, and by the time he gave the last lecture on June 17 his health had improved. He returned home toCambridge in September and soon began work on the second course of ten lectures. The writing this time proceededsmoothly, and that fall he also began to have the lectures set in type at H. O. Houghton's Riverside Press inCambridge for publication in New York and London by Longmans, Green, and Co. in June 1902. By late March hehad finished the index and corrected the proofs. The second course of lectures was delivered in Edinburgh from May13 to"},{"pageNumber":1430,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1351 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 31]Page 1351June 9, 1902, and before the lectures were finished he received the first copy of the completed book. It wasimmediately successful, and new printings were made from the plates in August, October, November, and December1902; January, March, and November 1903; April and September 1904; February 1905; February and November1906; May 1907; February and September 1908; August 1909; and June and October 1910. The thirty-eighth printingin 1935 was the last to be made from these plates.James's annotated copy of the first printing, in the Houghton Library at Harvard University, records corrections andrevisions he wanted to make in the text. Only about half were made in later printings, and a few of these had to beslightly altered to fit existing lines. Omitting or adding words, unless at the end of a paragraph, could be complicatedand expensive. For example, at 74.7 9, James wanted to revise \"and our articulately verbalized philosophy is but itsshowy translation into formulas. The unreasoned and immediate assurance is the deep thing in us, the reasonedargument is but a surface exhibition\" by omitting the italicized words and inserting \"verbalized\" after \"showy.\" Sincedropping six words would have involved considerable cutting of the plates and would have affected more than onepage, the change was not made. Though not marked in his copy, James also corrected the footnote on page 115 andadded quotation marks to the case studies on pages 117 20; apparently some early readers assumed that the casestudies were from James's own experience, and a correction slip was inserted into some copies of the first printing andthe corrections made in the second. The present volume prints the text of William James's annotated copy of the firstprinting of the first edition, Harvard *AC85.J2376.902v(c), incorporating all the corrections and revisions he markedin it, as well as the alterations noted on pages 115 and 117 20.Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking evolved from a series of lectures James began in 1905. Thefirst three courses of lectures were delivered from notes: five lectures at Wellesley College, February 28 to March 10,1905; five lectures at the University of Chicago, June 30 to July 7, 1905;"},{"pageNumber":1431,"pageContent":"fil // E|/T/MM3/ illi%20jP1352 hl[01 03 2011 21 23 31]Page 1352and a series of lectures at Glenmore in Keene, New York, July 28 to August 3, 1905. In preparation for eight lecturesto be given at the Lowell Institute in Boston from November 14 to December 8, 1906, James began the actual writingthat would become the book, and he was still writing the later lectures after he began delivering the first ones. Thelectures were repeated to large audiences at Columbia University from January 29 to February 8, 1907, and Jamescontinued to make revisions in them. Three of the lectures, I, II, and VI, were prepared for periodical publicationduring this time, but with the stipulation that they not be published until after his appearance at Columbia. Lecture I,\"The Present Dilemma in Philosophy,\" appeared under the title \"A Defence of Pragmatism: I. Its Mediating Office\" inPopular Science Monthly for March 1907; Lecture II, \"What Pragmatism Means,\" under the title \"A Defence ofPragmatism: II. What Pragmatism Means\" in Popular Science Monthly for April 1907; and Lecture VI, ''Pragmatism'sConception of Truth,\" in The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods for March 14, 1907. Jamesrevised these three lectures directly on the journal offprints and eventually submitted them in that form for bookpublication. A fourth article, used as the basis for Lecture III, \"Some Metaphysical Problems PragmaticallyConsidered,\" had been published earlier under the title \"The Pragmatic Method\" in The Journal of Philosophy,Psychology and Scientific Methods for December 9, 1904; this revision in turn had been a revision of \"PhilosophicalConceptions and Practical Results,\" in The University of California Chronicle for September 1898, reprinted for thePhilosophical Union of the University of California (Berkeley: The University Press, 1898). This article was alsoprepared for book publication by revising journal pages that were supplemented by newly prepared manuscript. Theremaining four lectures were submitted in heavily revised manuscript. James took the manuscript to the printer, H. O.Houghton's Riverside Press in Cambridge, in March 1907. The book was published in New York and London byLongmans, Green, and Co. from sheets printed at the Riverside Press in June 1907.

The spelling of \"Vivekananda\" was also corrected in two otherplaces and in the index, though James did not mark them in his own copy; slight alterations in James's wording wereagain necessary to make room for the additional syllable. No other corrections were made. The present volume printsthe text of James's own corrected copy of the first printing of the first edition of Pragmatism, Harvard*AC85.J2376.907p(c), and includes all the revisions and corrections he marked in it.On November 29, 1907, James accepted an offer to give a course of eight Hibbert Lectures at Manchester College inOxford in the spring of 1908 and immediately set to work. By the time he sailed for England in April 1908 he hadwritten almost all of the lectures that were to become A Pluralistic Universe. He left the bulk of the manuscript to beset at H. O. Houghton's Riverside Press. Proof was sent to him for correction while he was still at Oxford. The firstlecture was delivered May 4 and the last May 28, 1908, attracting audiences larger than those of any previous lectureron philosophy at Oxford. During the rest of the summer he continued to correct proof sent to him by the RiversidePress. He also prepared four of the lectures for successive publication in The Hibbert Journal, condensing andomitting some material, as well as cutting introductory remarks and other forms of direct address to the audience inorder to shorten the pieces to fit the Journal format. Lecture VIII, \"Conclusions,\" appeared as \"Pluralism andReligion\" (July 1908); Lecture III as \"Hegel and His Method\" (October 1908); Lecture IV, \"Concerning Fechner,\" as\"The Doctrine of the Earth-Soul and of Beings Intermediate Between Man and God.

Two were slightly revised versions ofearlier articles: Appendix A, \"The Thing and Its Relations,\" had appeared in The Journal of Philosophy, Psychologyand Scientific Methods for January 19, 1905; and Appendix B, \"The Experience of Activity,\" in The PsychologicalReview for January 1905. The third, \"On the Notion of Reality as Changing,'' appeared for the first time as AppendixC in A Pluralistic Universe.James continued to make revisions even after the book was already in type. Apparently when he first gave themanuscript to Houghton for setting, it did not include the notes, because—in contrast to the form of his other books—the notes in the first edition of A Pluralistic Universe are in a section by themselves following the lectures and beforethe appendices. The book was published April 1909 in New York and London by Longmans, Green, and Co. Sheetsprinted by the Riverside Press in Cambridge were used for both American and English publication. A second printing(with unaltered text) was made in August 1909, but a third printing was not called for until March 1912, and therewere far fewer printings of A Pluralistic Universe than there had been of The Varieties of Religious Experience orPragmatism. The text of James's own corrected copy of the first printing of the first edition at the Houghton Library,Harvard University (WJ 200.25.3), including the twelve corrections and revisions he marked in it, is printed in thepresent volume. Each note has been placed at the foot of the page containing the passage referred to, following theform of the other books.Soon after finishing work on A Pluralistic Universe James began assembling and revising a group of previouslypublished journal essays for inclusion in The Meaning of Truth: A Sequel to 'Pragmatism.' His own notes to the firsteight chapters and Chapter XII identify the original appearances of these nine essays.

Chapter IX, \"The Meaning of the Word Truth,\" was revised either from the privately printedpamphlet or from the version printed in Mind, July 1908. Chapter X, \"The Existence of Julius Cæsar,\" was printed inThe Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods, March 26, 1908. Chapter XIII, \"Abstractionism and'Relativismus,'\" originally appeared in Popular Science Monthly, May 1909. James added transitional sentences andparagraphs to the original articles, extracted parts of others, and reworked phrases and punctuation. The Preface,Chapter XIV, ''Two English Critics,\" and Chapter XV, \"A Dialogue,\" were written for the volume. No index wasprepared for this work. The manuscript was delivered by James to the Riverside Press in Cambridge April 7, 1909.The Meaning of Truth was published in New York and London by Longmans, Green, and Co. in October 1909. Sheetsfrom the Riverside Press were again used for both American and English publication. Second and third printingsfollowed in November, and a fourth printing appeared in January 1911. James's own copy of the first printing containsa list of six corrections and revisions he wanted to make: one of them was made in the second printing and four othersin the third. The printer also made one unauthorized change: James wanted to emend \"anything else I am aware of\" to\"anything else of which I am aware\" (963.33), but the printer, to make this revision fit, shortened it to \"anything ofwhich I am aware.\" The present volume prints the text of James's private copy of the first printing of the first edition,Harvard *AC85.J2376.909m(b), and incorporates the six changes that James wanted made.James did not live to see Some Problems of Philosophy into print. His written instructions for publishing the booknoted that \"it is fragmentary and unrevised. Say that I hoped by it to round out my system, which now is too muchlike an arch built only on one side.\" Before his death he appointed Horace M.
