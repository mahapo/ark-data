[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"In framing an ideal we may assume what we wish, but should avoidimpossibilities.ARISTOTLEIslandby Aldous Huxley1\"Attention,\" a voice began to call, and it was as though an oboe hadsuddenly become articulate. \"Attention,\" it repeated in the same high, nasalmonotone. \"Attention.\"Lying there like a corpse in the dead leaves, his hair matted, his facegrotesquely smudged and bruised, his clothes in rags and muddy, WillFarnaby awoke with a start. Molly had called him. Time to get up. Time toget dressed. Mustn't be late at the office.\"Thank you, darling,\" he said and sat up. A sharp pain stabbed at hisright knee and there were other kinds of pain in his back, his arms, hisforehead.\"Attention,\" the voice insisted without the slightest change of tone.Leaning on one elbow, Will looked about himand saw with bewilderment,not the gray wallpaper and yellow curtains of his London bedroom, but aglade among trees and the long shadows and slanting lights of earlymorning in a forest.\"Attention\"?Why did she say, \"Attention\"?\"Attention. Attention,\" the voice insisted—how strangely, howsenselessly!2Island\"Molly?\" he questioned. \"Molly?\"The name seemed to open a window inside his head. Suddenly, withthat horribly familiar sense of guilt at the pit of the stomach, he smeltformaldehyde, he saw the small brisk nurse hurrying ahead of himalongthe green corridor, heard the dry creaking of her starched clothes. \"Numberfifty-five,\" she was saying, and then halted, opened a white door. Heentered and there, on a high white bed, was Molly. Molly with bandagescovering half her face and the mouth hanging cavernously open. \"Molly,\"he had called, \"Molly ...\" His voice had broken, and he was crying, wasimploring now, \"My darling!\" There was no answer. Through the gaping"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mouth the quick shallow breaths came noisily, again, again. \"My darling,my darling . . .\" And then suddenly the hand he was holding came to life fora moment. Then was still again.\"It's me,\" he said, \"it's Will.\"Once more the fingers stirred. Slowly, with what was evidently anenormous effort, they closed themselves over his own, pressed themfor amoment and then relaxed again into lifelessness.\"Attention,\" called the inhuman voice. \"Attention.\"It had been an accident, he hastened to assure himself. The road waswet, the car had skidded across the white line. It was one of those thingsthat happen all the time. The papers are full of them; he had reported themby the dozen. \"Mother and three children killed in head-on crash ...\" Butthat was beside the point. The point was that, when she asked him if it wasreally the end, he had said yes; the point was that less than an hour aftershe had walked out fromthat last shameful interview into the rain, Mollywas in the ambulance, dying.3He hadn't looked at her as she turned to go, hadn't dared to look ather. Another glimpse of that pale suffering face might have been too muchfor him. She had risen from her chair and was moving slowly across theroom, moving slowly out of hislife. Shouldn't he call her back, ask her forgiveness, tell her that he stillloved her? Had he ever loved her?For the hundredth time the articulate oboe called himto attention.Yes, had he ever really loved her?\"Good-bye, Will,\" came her remembered whisper as she turned backon the threshold. And then it was she who had said it—in a whisper, fromthe depths of her heart. \"I still love you, Will—in spite of everything.\"A moment later the door of the flat closed behind her almost without asound. The little dry click of the latch, and she was gone.He had jumped up, had run to the front door and opened it, hadlistened to the retreating footsteps on the stairs. Like a ghost at cockcrow, afaint familiar perfume lingered vanishingly on the air. He closed the dooragain, walked into his gray-and-yellow bedroom and looked out the widow.A few seconds passed, then he saw her crossing the pavement and gettinginto the car. He heard the shrill grinding of the starter, once, twice, and afterthat the drumming of the motor. Should he open the window? \"Wait, Molly,wait,\" he heard himself shouting in imagination. The window remained"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"unopened; the car began to move, turned the corner and the street wasempty. It was too late. Too late, thank God! said a gross derisive voice.Yes, thank God! And yet the guilt was there at the pit of his stomach. Theguilt, the gnawing of his remorse—but through the remorse he could feel ahorrible rejoicing. Somebody low and lewd and brutal, somebody alien andodious who was yet himself was gleefully thinking that now there wasnothing to prevent himfromhaving what he wanted. And what he wantedwas a different perfume, was the warmth and resilience of a younger body.\"Attention,\" said the oboe. Yes, attention. Attention to Babs's muskybedroom, with its strawberry-pink alcove and the two windows that looked4Islandonto the Charing Cross Road and were looked into, all night long, by thewinking glare of the big sky sign for Porter's Gin on the opposite side of thestreet. Gin in royal crimson—and for ten seconds the alcove was theSacred Heart, for ten miraculous seconds the flushed face so close to hisown glowed like a seraph's, transfigured as though by an inner fire of love.Then came the yet profounder transfiguration of darkness. One, two, three,four . . . Ah God, make it go on forever! But punctually at the count of tenthe electric clock would turn on another revelation—but of death, of theEssential Horror; for the lights, this time, were green, and for ten hideousseconds Babs's rosy alcove became a womb of mud and, on the bed, Babsherself was corpse-colored, a cadaver galvanized into posthumousepilepsy. When Porter's Gin proclaimed itself in green, it was hard to forgetwhat had happened and who one was. The only thing to do was to shutone's eyes and plunge, if one could, more deeply into the Other World ofsensuality, plunge violently, plunge deliberately into those alienatingfrenzies to which poor Molly—Molly (\"Attention\") in her bandages, Molly inher wet grave at Highgate, and Highgate, of course, was why one had toshut one's eyes each time when the green light made a corpse of Babs'snakedness—had always and so utterly been a stranger. And not only Molly.Behind his closed eyelids, Will saw his mother, pale like a cameo, her facespiritualized by accepted suffering, her hands made monstrous andsubhuman by arthritis. His mother and, standing behind her wheelchair,already running to fat and quivering like calf's-foot jelly with all the feelingsthat had never found their proper expression in consummated love, was hissister Maud.\"How can you, Will?\"\"Yes, how can you?\" Maud echoed tearfully in her vibrating contralto."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There was no answer. No answer, that was to say, in any words thatcould be uttered in their presence, that, uttered,those two martyrs—the mother to her unhappy marriage, the daughter tofilial piety—could possibly understand. No answer except in words of themost obscenely scientific objectivity, the most inadmissible frankness. Howcould he do it? He could do it, for all practical purposes was compelled todo it, because . . . well, because Babs had certain physical peculiaritieswhich Molly did not possess and behaved at certain moments in wayswhich Molly would have found unthinkable.There had been a long silence; but now, abruptly, the strange voicetook up its old refrain.\"Attention. Attention.\"Attention to Molly, attention to Maud and his mother, attention to Babs.And suddenly another memory emerged from the fog of vagueness andconfusion. Babs's strawberry-pink alcove sheltered another guest, and itsowner's body was shuddering ecstatically under somebody else's caresses.To the guilt in the stomach was added an anguish about the heart, aconstriction of the throat.\"Attention.\"The voice had come nearer, was calling from somewhere over there tothe right. He turned his head, he tried to raise himself for a better view; butthe arm that supported his weight began to tremble, then gave way, and hefell back into the leaves. Too tired to go on remembering, he lay there for along time staring up through half-closed lids at the incomprehensible worldaround him. Where was he and how on earth had he got here? Not that thiswas of any importance. At the moment nothing was of any importanceexcept this pain, this annihilating weakness. All the same, just as a matterof scientific interest. . .This tree, for example, under which (for no known reason) he foundhimself lying, this column of gray bark with the groining, high up, of sun-speckled branches, this ought by rights to be a beech tree. But in thatcase—and Will admired himself for being so lucidly logical—in that casethe leaves had no right to6Islandbe so obviously evergreen. And why would a beech tree send its rootselbowing up like this above the surface of the ground? And thosepreposterous wooden buttresses, on which the pseudo-beech supporteditself—where did those fit into the picture? Will remembered suddenly his"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"favorite worst line of poetry. \"Who prop, thou ask'st, in these bad days mymind?\" Answer: congealed ectoplasm, Early Dali. Which definitely ruled outthe Chilterns. So did the butterflies swooping out there in the thick butterysunshine. Why were they so large, so improbably cerulean or velvet black,so extravagantly eyed and freckled? Purple staring out of chestnut, silverpowdered over emerald, over topaz, over sapphire.\"Attention.\"\"Who's there?\" Will Farnaby called in what he intended to be a loudand formidable tone; but all that came out of his mouth was a thin,quavering croak.There was a long and, it seemed, profoundly menacing silence. Fromthe hollow between two of the tree's wooden buttresses an enormous blackcentipede emerged for a moment into view, then hurried away on itsregiment of crimson legs and vanished into another cleft in the lichen-covered ectoplasm.\"Who's there?\" he croaked again.There was a rustling in the bushes on his left and suddenly, like acuckoo froma nursery clock, out popped a large black bird, the size of ajackdaw—only, needless to say, it wasn't a jackdaw. It clapped a pair ofwhite-tipped wings and, darting across the intervening space, settled on thelowest branch of a small dead tree, not twenty feet from where Will waslying. Its beak, he noticed, was orange, and it had a bald yellow patchunder each eye, with canary-colored wattles that covered the sides andback of its head with a thick wig of naked flesh. The bird cocked its headand looked at him first with the right eye, then with the left. After which itopened its orange bill, whistled ten or twelve7notes of a little air in the pentatonic scale, made a noise like somebodyhaving hiccups, and then, in a chanting phrase, do do sol do, said, \"Hereand now, boys; here and now, boys.\"The words pressed a trigger, and all of a sudden he rememberedeverything. Here was Pala, the forbidden island, the place no journalist hadever visited. And now must be the morning after the afternoon when he'dbeen fool enough to go sailing, alone, outside the harbor of Rendang-Lobo.He remembered it all—the white sail curved by the wind into the likeness ofa huge magnolia petal, the water sizzling at the prow, the sparkle ofdiamonds on every wave crest, the troughs of wrinkled jade. Andeastwards, across the Strait, what clouds, what prodigies of sculptured"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"whiteness above the volcanoes of Pala! Sitting there at the tiller, he hadcaught himself singing—caught himself, incredibly, in the act of feelingunequivocally happy.\" 'Three, three for the rivals,' \" he had declaimed into the wind.\" 'Two, two for the lily-white boys, clothed all in green-oh; One is oneand all alone . . . ' \"Yes, all alone. All alone on the enormous jewel of the sea. \" 'And evermore shall be so.' \"After which, needless to say, the thing that all the cautious andexperienced yachtsmen had warned himagainst happened. The blacksquall out of nowhere, the sudden, senseless frenzy of wind and rain andwaves . . .\"Here and now, boys,\" chanted the bird. \"Here and now, boys.\"The really extraordinary thing was that he should be here, he reflected,under the trees and not out there, at the bottomof the Pala Strait or, worse,smashed to pieces at the foot of the cliffs. For even after he had managed,by sheer miracle, to take his sinking boat through the breakers and run heraground on the only sandy beach in all those miles of Pala's rockboundcoast—8Islandeven then it wasn't over. The cliffs towered above him; but at the head ofthe cove there was a kind of headlong ravine where a little stream camedown in a succession of filmy waterfalls, and there were trees and bushesgrowing between the walls of gray limestone. Six or seven hundred feet ofrock climbing—in tennis shoes, and all the footholes slippery with water.And then, dear God! those snakes. The black one looped over the branchby which he was pulling himself up. And five minutes later, the huge greenone coiled there on the ledge, just where he was preparing to step. Terrorhad been succeeded by a terror infinitely worse. The sight of the snake hadmade him start, made himviolently withdraw his foot, and that suddenunconsidered movement had made himlose his balance. For a longsickening second, in the dreadful knowledge that this was the end, he hadswayed on the brink, then fallen. Death, death, death. And then, with thenoise of splintering wood in his ears he had found himself clinging to thebranches of a small tree, his face scratched, his right knee bruised andbleeding, but alive. Painfully he had resumed his climbing. His knee hurthimexcruciatingly; but he climbed on. There was no alternative. And thenthe light had begun to fail. In the end he was climbing almost in darkness,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"climbing by faith, climbing by sheer despair.\"Here and now, boys,\" shouted the bird.But Will Farnaby was neither here nor now. He was there on the rockface, he was then at the dreadful moment of falling. The dry leaves rustledbeneath him; he was trembling. Violently, uncontrollably, he was tremblingfromhead to foot.9Suddenly the bird ceased to be articulate and started to scream. Asmall shrill human voice said, \"Mynah!\" and then added something in alanguage that Will did not understand. There was a sound of footsteps ondry leaves. Then a little cry of alarm. Then silence. Will opened his eyesand saw two exquisite children looking down at him, their eyes wide withastonishment and a fascinated horror. The smaller of themwas a tiny boyof five, perhaps, or six, dressed only in a green loincloth. Beside him,carrying a basket of fruit on her head, stood a little girl some four or fiveyears older. She wore a full crimson skirt that reached almost to her ankles;but above the waist she was naked. In the sunlight her skin glowed likepale copper flushed with rose. Will looked from one child to the other. Howbeautiful they were, and how faultless, how extraordinarily elegant! Like twolittle thoroughbreds. A round and sturdy thoroughbred, with a face like acherub's—that was the boy. And the girl was another kind of thoroughbred,fine-drawn, with a rather long, grave little face framed between braids ofdark hair.There was another burst of screaming. On its perch in the dead treethe bird was turning nervously this way and that; then,10Islandwith a final screech, it dived into the air. Without taking her eyes from Will'sface, the girl held out her hand invitingly. The bird fluttered, settled, flappedwildly, found its balance, then folded its wings and immediately started tohiccup. Will looked on without surprise. Anything was possible now—anything. Even talking birds that would perch on a child's finger. Will tried tosmile at them; but his lips were still trembling, and what was meant to be asign of friendliness must have seemed like a frightening grimace. The littleboy took cover behind his sister.The bird stopped hiccuping and began to repeat a word that Will didnot understand. \"Runa\"—was that it? No, \"karuna,\" Definitely \"karuna.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"He raised a trembling hand and pointed at the fruit in the round basket.Mangoes, bananas . . . His dry mouth was watering.\"Hungry,\" he said. Then, feeling that in these exotic circumstances thechild might understand himbetter if he put on an imitation of a musical-comedy Chinaman, \"Me velly hungry,\" he elaborated.\"Do you want to eat?\" the child asked in perfect English.\"Yes—eat,\" he repeated, \"eat.\"\"Fly away, mynah!\" She shook her hand. The bird uttered a protestingsquawk and returned to its perch on the dead tree. Lifting her thin littlearms in a gesture that was like a dancer's, the child raised the basket fromher head, then lowered it to the ground. She selected a banana, peeled itand, torn between fear and compassion, advanced towards the stranger. Inhis incomprehensible language the little boy uttered a cry of warning andclutched at her skirt. With a reassuring word, the girl halted, well out ofdanger, and held up the fruit.\"Do you want it?\" she asked.Still trembling, Will Farnaby stretched out his hand. Very cautiously,she edged forward, then halted again and, crouching down, peered at himintently.11\"Quick,\" he said in an agony of impatience.But the little girl was taking no chances. Eyeing his hand for the leastsign of a suspicious movement, she leaned forward, she cautiouslyextended her arm.\"For God's sake,\" he implored.\"God?\" the child repeated with sudden interest. \"Which god?\" sheasked. \"There are such a lot of them.\"\"Any damned god you like,\" he answered impatiently.\"I don't really like any of them,\" she answered. \"I like theCompassionate One.\"\"Then be compassionate to me,\" he begged. \"Give me that banana.\"Her expression changed. \"I'm sorry,\" she said apologetically. Rising toher full height, she took a quick step forward and dropped the fruit into hisshaking hand.\"There,\" she said and, like a little animal avoiding a trap, she jumpedback, out of reach.The small boy clapped his hands and laughed aloud. She turned andsaid something to him. He nodded his round head, and saying \"Okay,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"boss,\" trotted away, through a barrage of blue and sulphur butterflies, intothe forest shadows on the further side of the glade.\"I told TomKrishna to go and fetch someone,\" she explained.Will finished his banana and asked for another, and then for a third. Asthe urgency of his hunger diminished, he felt a need to satisfy his curiosity.\"How is it that you speak such good English?\" he asked.\"Because everybody speaks English,\" the child answered.\"Everybody?\"\"I mean, when they're not speaking Palanese.\" Finding the subjectuninteresting, she turned, waved a small brown hand and whistled.\"Here and now, boys,\" the bird repeated yet once more, then12Islandfluttered down from its perch on the dead tree and settled on her shoulder.The child peeled another banana, gave two-thirds of it to Will and offeredwhat remained to the mynah.\"Is that your bird?\" Will asked.She shook her head.\"Mynahs are like the electric light,\" she said. \"They don't belong toanybody.\"\"Why does he say those things?\"\"Because somebody taught him,\" she answered patiently. What anass! her tone seemed to imply.\"But why did they teach him those things? Why 'Attention'? Why 'Hereand now'?\"\"Well ...\" She searched for the right words in which to explain the self-evident to this strange imbecile. \"That's what you always forget, isn't it? Imean, you forget to pay attention to what's happening. And that's the sameas not being here and now.\"\"And the mynahs fly about reminding you—is that it?\"She nodded. That, of course, was it. There was a silence.\"What's your name?\" she inquired.Will introduced himself.\"My name's Mary Sarojini MacPhail.\"\"MacPhail?\" It was too implausible.\"MacPhail,\" she assured him.\"And your little brother is called TomKrishna?\" She nodded. \"Well, I'mdamned!\"\"Did you come to Pala by the airplane?\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"I came out of the sea.\"\"Out of the sea? Do you have a boat?\"\"I did have one.\" With his mind's eye Will saw the waves breaking overthe stranded hulk, heard with his inner ear the crash of their impact. Underher questioning he told her what had happened. The storm, the beaching ofthe boat, the long13nightmare of the climb, the snakes, the horror of falling . . . He began totremble again, more violently than ever.Mary Sarojini listened attentively and without comment. Then, as hisvoice faltered and finally broke, she stepped forward and, the bird stillperched on her shoulder, kneeled down beside him.\"Listen, Will,\" she said, laying a hand on his forehead. \"We've got toget rid of this.\" Her tone was professional and calmly authoritative.\"I wish I knew how,\" he said between chattering teeth.\"How?\" she repeated. \"But in the usual way, of course. Tell me againabout those snakes and how you fell down.\"He shook his head. \"I don't want to.\"\"Of course you don't want to,\" she said. \"But you've got to. Listen towhat the mynah's saying.\"\"Here and now, boys,\" the bird was still exhorting. \"Here and now,boys.\"\"You can't be here and now,\" she went on, \"until you've got rid of thosesnakes. Tell me.\"\"I don't want to, I don't want to.\" He was almost in tears.\"Then you'll never get rid of them. They'll be crawling about inside yourhead forever. And serve you right,\" Mary Sarojini added severely.He tried to control the trembling; but his body had ceased to belong tohim. Someone else was in charge, someone malevolently determined tohumiliate him, to make him suffer.\"Remember what happened when you were a little boy,\" Mary Sarojiniwas saying. \"What did your mother do when you hurt yourself?\"She had taken him in her arms, had said, \"My poor baby, my poor littlebaby.\"\"She did that?\" The child spoke in a tone of shocked amazement. \"Butthat's awful! That's the way to rub it in. 'My poor14Island"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"15baby,' \" she repeated derisively, \"it must have gone on hurting for hours.And you'd never forget it.\"Will Farnaby made no comment, but lay there in silence, shaken byirrepressible shudderings.\"Well, if you won't do it yourself, I'll have to do it for you. Listen, Will:there was a snake, a big green snake, and you almost stepped on him. Youalmost stepped on him, and it gave you such a fright that you lost yourbalance, you fell. Now say it yourself—say it!\"\"I almost stepped on him,\" he whispered obediently. \"And then I ...\" Hecouldn't say it. \"Then I fell,\" he brought out at last, almost inaudibly.All the horror of it came back to him—the nausea of fear, the panicstart that had made himlose his balance, and then worse fear and theghastly certainty that it was the end.\"Say it again.\"\"I almost stepped on him. And then ...\"He heard himself whimpering.\"That's right, Will. Cry—cry!\"The whimpering became a moaning. Ashamed, he clenched his teeth,and the moaning stopped.\"No, don't do that,\" she cried. \"Let it come out if it wants to. Rememberthat snake, Will. Remember how you fell.\"The moaning broke out again and he began to shudder more violentlythan ever.\"Now tell me what happened.\"\"I could see its eyes, I could see its tongue going in and out.\"\"Yes, you could see his tongue. And what happened then?\"\"I lost my balance, I fell.\"\"Say it again, Will.\" He was sobbing now. \"Say it again,\" she insisted.\"I fell.\"\"Again.\"It was tearing him to pieces, but he said it. \"I fell.\"\"Again, Will.\" She was implacable. \"Again.\"\"I fell, I fell. I fell . . .\"Gradually the sobbing died down. The words came more easily andthe memories they aroused were less painful.\"I fell,\" he repeated for the hundredth time.\"But you didn't fall very far,\" Mary Sarojini now said."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"\"No, I didn't fall very far,\" he agreed.\"So what's all the fuss about?\" the child inquired.There was no malice or irony in her tone, not the slightest implicationof blame. She was just asking a simple, straightforward question that calledfor a simple, straightforward answer. Yes, what was all the fuss about? Thesnake hadn't bitten him; he hadn't broken his neck. And anyhow it had allhappened yesterday. Today there were these butterflies, this bird thatcalled one to attention, this strange child who talked to one like a Dutchuncle, looked like an angel out of some unfamiliar mythology and within fivedegrees of the equator was called, believe it or not, MacPhail. Will Farnabylaughed aloud.The little girl clapped her hands and laughed too. A moment later thebird on her shoulder joined in with peal upon peal of loud demonic laughterthat filled the glade and echoed among the trees, so that the wholeuniverse seemed to be fairly splitting its sides over the enormous joke ofexistence.16Island\"Well, I'mglad it's all so amusing,\" a deep voice suddenly commented.Will Farnaby turned and saw, smiling down at him, a small spare mandressed in European clothes and carrying a black bag. A man, he judged,in his late fifties. Under the wide straw hat the hair was thick and white, andwhat a strange beaky nose! And the eyes—how incongruously blue in thedark face!\"Grandfather!\" he heard Mary Sarojini exclaiming.The stranger turned from Will to the child.\"What was so funny?\" he asked.\"Well,\" Mary Sarojini began, and paused for a moment to marshal herthoughts. \"Well, you see, he was in a boat and there was that stormyesterday and he got wrecked—somewhere down there. So he had toclimb up the cliff. And there were some snakes, and he fell down. Butluckily there was a tree, so he only had a fright. Which was why he wasshivering so hard, so I gave him some bananas and I made himgo throughit a million times. And then all of a sudden he saw that it wasn't anything toworry about. I mean, it's all over and done with. And that made him17laugh. And when he laughed, I laughed. And then the mynah bird laughed.\""},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"\"Very good,\" said her grandfather approvingly. \"And now,\" he added,turning back to Will Farnaby, \"after the psychological first aid, let's see whatcan be done for poor old Brother Ass. I'm Dr. Robert MacPhail, by the way.Who are you?\"\"His name's Will,\" said Mary Sarojini before the young man couldanswer. \"And his other name is Far-something.\"\"Farnaby, to be precise. WilliamAsquith Farnaby. My father, as youmight guess, was an ardent Liberal. Even when he was drunk. Especiallywhen he was drunk.\" He gave vent to a harsh derisive laugh strangelyunlike the full-throated merriment which had greeted his discovery thatthere was really nothing to make a fuss about.\"Didn't you like your father?\" Mary Sarojini asked with concern.\"Not as much as I might have,\" Will answered.\"What he means,\" Dr. MacPhail explained to the child, \"is that hehated his father. A lot of them do,\" he added parenthetically.Squatting down on his haunches, he began to undo the straps of hisblack bag.\"One of our ex-imperialists, I assume,\" he said over his shoulder to theyoung man.\"Born in Bloomsbury,\" Will confirmed.\"Upper class,\" the doctor diagnosed, \"but not a member of the militaryor county subspecies.\"\"Correct. My father was a barrister and political journalist. That is,when he wasn't too busy being an alcoholic. My mother, incredible as itmay seem, was the daughter of an archdeacon. An archdeacon,'\" herepeated, and laughed again as he had laughed over his father's taste forbrandy.Dr. MacPhail looked at him for a moment, then turned his attentiononce more to the straps.18Island\"When you laugh like that,\" he remarked in a tone of scientificdetachment, \"your face becomes curiously ugly.\"Taken aback, Will tried to cover his embarrassment with a piece offacetiousness. \"It's always ugly,\" he said.\"On the contrary, in a Baudelairean sort of way it's rather beautiful.Except when you choose to make noises like a hyena. Why do you makethose noises?\"\"I'ma journalist,\" Will explained. \"Our Special Correspondent, paid to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"travel about the world and report on the current horrors. What other kind ofnoise do you expect me to make? Coo-coo? Blah-blah? Marx-Marx?\" Helaughed again, then brought out one of his well-tried witticisms. \"I'm theman who won't take yes for an answer.\"\"Pretty,\" said Dr. MacPhail. \"Very pretty. But now let's get down tobusiness.\" Taking a pair of scissors out of his bag, he started to cut awaythe torn and bloodstained trouser leg that covered Will's injured knee.Will Farnaby looked up at himand wondered, as he looked, how muchof this improbable Highlander was still Scottish and how much Palanese.About the blue eyes and the jutting nose there could be no doubt. But thebrown skin, the delicate hands, the grace of movement—these surely camefromsomewhere considerably south of the Tweed.\"Were you born here?\" he asked.The doctor nodded affirmatively. \"At Shivapuram, on the day of QueenVictoria's funeral.\"There was a final click of the scissors, and the trouser leg fell away,exposing the knee. \"Messy,\" was Dr. MacPhail's verdict after a first intentscrutiny. \"But I don't think there's anything too serious.\" He turned to hisgranddaughter. \"I'd like you to run back to the station and ask Vijaya tocome here with one of the other men. Tell them to pick up a stretcher at theinfirmary.\"Mary Sarojini nodded and, without a word, rose to her feet and hurriedaway across the glade.19Will looked after the small figure as it receded—the red skirt swingingfromside to side, the smooth skin of the torso glowing rosily golden in thesunlight.\"You have a very remarkable granddaughter,\" he said to Dr. MacPhail.\"Mary Sarojini's father,\" said the doctor after a little silence, \"was myeldest son. He died four months ago—a mountain-climbing accident.\"Will mumbled his sympathy, and there was another silence.Dr. MacPhail uncorked a bottle of alcohol and swabbed his hands.\"This is going to hurt a bit,\" he warned. \"I'd suggest that you listen tothat bird.\" He waved a hand in the direction of the dead tree, to which, afterMary Sarojini's departure, the mynah had returned.\"Listen to himclosely, listen discriminatingly. It'll keep your mind off thediscomfort.\"Will Farnaby listened. The mynah had gone back to its first theme."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"Attention,\" the articulate oboe was calling. \"Attention.\"\"Attention to what?\" he asked, in the hope of eliciting a moreenlightening answer than the one he had received fromMary Sarojini.\"To attention,\" said Dr. MacPhail.\"Attention to attention?\"\"Of course.\"\"Attention,\" the mynah chanted in ironical confirmation.\"Do you have many of these talking birds?\"\"There must be at least a thousand of themflying about the island.

And Murugan Mailen-dra\" (he waved his hand in thedirection of the dark-skinned boy) \"is with us temporarily, studying soilscience and plant breeding.\"Vijaya stepped aside and, laying a large hand on his companion'sshoulder, pushed him forward. Looking up into that beau-21tiful, sulky young face, Will suddenly recognized, with a start of surprise,the elegantly tailored youth he had met, five days before, at Rendang-Lobo,had driven with in Colonel Dipa's white Mercedes all over the island. Hesmiled, he opened his mouth to speak, then checked himself. Almostimperceptibly but quite unmistakenly, the boy had shaken his head. In hiseyes Will saw an expression of anguished pleading. His lips movedsoundlessly. \"Please,\" he seemed to be saying, \"please ...\" Will readjustedhis face.\"How do you do, Mr. Mailendra,\" he said in a tone of casual formality.Murugan looked enormously relieved. \"How do you do,\" he said, andmade a little bow.Will looked round to see if the others had noticed what had happened.Mary Sarojini and Vijaya, he saw, were busy with tli£ stretcher and thedoctor was repacking his black bag. The little comedy had been playedwithout an audience. Young Murugan evidently had his reasons for notwanting it to be known that he had been in Rendang. Boys will be boys.Boys will even be girls. Colonel Dipa had been more than fatherly towardshis young protege, and towards the Colonel, Murugan had been a gooddeal more than filial—he had been positively adoring. Was it merely heroworship, merely a schoolboy's admiration for the strong man who hadcarried out a successful revolution, liquidated the opposition, and installedhimself as dictator? Or were other feelings involved? Was Murugan playingAntinous to this black-mustached Hadrian? Well, if that was how he feltabout middle-aged military gangsters, that was his privilege. And if thegangster liked pretty boys, that was his. And perhaps, Will went on toreflect, that was why Colonel Dipa had refrained frommaking a formalintroduction. \"This is Muru\" was all he had said when the boy was usheredinto the presidential office. \"My young friend Muru,\" and he had risen, hadput his arm around the boy's shoulders, had led him to the sofa and sat"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"down beside22Islandhim. \"May I drive the Mercedes?\" Murugan had asked. The dictator hadsmiled indulgently and nodded his sleek black head. And that was anotherreason for thinking that more than mere friendliness was involved in thatcurious relationship. At the wheel of the Colonel's sports car Murugan wasa maniac. Only an infatuated lover would have entrusted himself, not tomention his guest, to such a chauffeur. On the flat between Rendang-Loboand the oil fields the speedometer had twice touched a hundred and ten;and worse, much worse, was to follow on the mountain road from the oilfields to the copper mines. Chasms yawned, tires screeched round corners,water buffaloes emerged from bamboo thickets a few feet ahead of the car,ten-ton lorries came roaring down on the wrong side of the road. \"Aren'tyou a little nervous?\" Will had ventured to ask. But the gangster was piousas well as infatuated. \"If one knows that one is doing the will of Allah—and Ido know it, Mr. Farnaby—there is no excuse for nervousness. In thosecircumstances, nervousness would be blasphemy.\" And as Muruganswerved to avoid yet another buffalo, he opened his gold cigarette caseand offered Will a Balkan Sobranje.\"Ready,\" Vijaya called.Will turned his head and saw the stretcher lying on the ground besidehim.\"Good!\" said Dr. MacPhail. \"Let's lift him onto it. Carefully. Carefully ...\"A minute later the little procession was winding its way up the narrowpath between the trees. Mary Sarojini was in the van, her grandfatherbrought up the rear and, between them, came Murugan and Vijaya at eitherend of the stretcher.Fromhis moving bed Will Farnaby looked up through the greendarkness as though fromthe floor of a living sea. Far overhead, near thesurface, there was a rustling among the leaves, a noise of monkeys. Andnow it was a dozen hornbills hopping,23like the figments of a disordered imagination, through a cloud of orchids.\"Are you comfortable?\" Vijaya asked, bending solicitously to look intohis face.Will smiled back at him."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\"Luxuriously comfortable,\" he said.\"It isn't far,\" the other went on reassuringly. \"We'll be there in a fewminutes.\"\"Where's 'there'?\"\"The Experimental Station. It's like Rothamsted. Did you ever go toRothamsted when you were in England?\"Will had heard of it, of course, but never seen the place.\"It's been going for more than a hundred years,\" Vijaya went on.\"A hundred and eighteen, to be precise,\" said Dr. MacPhail. \"Lawesand Gilbert started their work on fertilizers in 1843. One of their pupilscame out here in the early fifties to help my grandfather get our stationgoing. Rothamsted in the tropics—that was the idea. In the tropics and forthe tropics.\"There was a lightening of the green gloom and a moment later the litteremerged from the forest into the full glare of tropical sunshine. Will raisedhis head and looked about him. They were not far from the floor of animmense amphitheater. Five hundred feet below stretched a wide plain,checkered with fields, dotted with clumps of trees and clustered houses. Inthe other direction the slopes climbed up and up, thousands of feet towardsa semicircle of mountains. Terrace above green or golden terrace, fromtheplain to the crenelated wall of peaks, the rice paddies followed the contourlines, emphasizing every swell and recession of the slope with whatseemed a deliberate and artful intention. Nature here was no longer merelynatural; the landscape had been composed, had been reduced to itsgeometrical essences, and rendered, by what in a painter would have24Islandbeen a miracle of virtuosity, in terms of these sinuous lines, these streaksof pure bright color.\"What were you doing in Rendang?\" Dr. Robert asked, breaking a longsilence.\"Collecting materials for a piece on the new regime.\" \"I wouldn't havethought the Colonel was newsworthy.\" \"You're mistaken. He's amilitarydictator. That means there's death in the offing. And death is always news.Even the remote smell of death is news.\" He laughed. \"That's why I wastold to drop in on my way back fromChina.\"And there had been other reasons which he preferred not to mention.Newspapers were only one of Lord Aldehyde's interests. In anothermanifestation he was the Southeast Asia PetroleumCompany, he was"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Imperial and Foreign Copper Limited. Officially, Will had come to Rendangto sniff the death in its militarized air; but he had also been commissionedto find out what the dictator felt about foreign capital, what tax rebates hewas prepared to offer, what guarantees against nationalization. And howmuch of the profits would be exportable? How many native technicians andadministrators would have to be employed? A whole battery of questions.But Colonel Dipa had been most affable and co-operative. Hence that hair-raising drive, with Murugan at the wheel, to the copper mines. \"Primitive,my dear Farnaby, primitive. Urgently in need, as you can see for yourself,of modern equipment.\" Another meeting had been arranged—arranged,Will now remembered, for this very morning. He visualized the Colonel athis desk. A report from the chief of police. \"Mr. Farnaby was last seensailing a small boat singlehanded into the Pala Strait. Two hours later astormof great violence . . . Presumed dead ...\" Instead of which, here hewas, alive and kicking, on the forbidden island.\"They'll never give you a visa,\" Joe Aldehyde had said at their lastinterview. \"But perhaps you could sneak ashore in disguise. Wear aburnous or something, like Lawrence of Arabia.\"25With a straight face, \"I'll try,\" Will had promised.\"Anyhow, if you ever do manage to land in Pala, make a bee-line forthe palace. The Rani—that's their Queen Mother—is an old friend of mine.Met her for the first time six years ago at Lugano. She was staying therewith old Voegeli, the investment banker. His girl friend is interested inspiritualismand they staged a seance for me. A trumpet medium, genuineDirect Voice—only unfortunately it was all in German. Well, after the lightswere turned on, I had a long talk with her.\"\"With the trumpet?\"\"No, no. With the Rani. She's a remarkable woman. You know, theCrusade of the Spirit.\"\"Was that her invention?\"\"Absolutely. And personally I prefer it to Moral Rearmament. It goesdown better in Asia. We had a long talk about it that evening. And after thatwe talked about oil. Pala's full of oil. Southeast Asia Petroleumhas beentrying to get in on it for years. So have all the other companies. Nothingdoing. No oil concessions to anyone. It's their fixed policy. But the Ranidoesn't agree with it. She wants to see the oil doing some good in theworld. Financing the Crusade of the Spirit, for example. So, as I say, if ever"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"you get to Pala, make a beeline for the palace. Talk to her. Get the insidestory about the men who make the decisions. Find out if there's a pro-oilminority and ask how we could help themto carry on the good work.\" Andhe had ended by promising Will a handsome bonus if his efforts should becrowned with success. Enough to give him a full year of freedom. \"No morereporting. Nothing but High Art, Art, A-ART.\" And he had uttered ascatalogical laugh as though the word had an s at the end of it and not a t.Unspeakable creature! But all the same he wrote for the unspeakablecreature's vile papers and was ready, for a bribe, to do the vile creature'sdirty work. And now, incredibly, here he was on Palanese soil. As luckwould have it, Providence had been on his side—for the express26Islandpurpose, evidently, of perpetrating one of those sinister practical jokeswhich are Providence's specialty.He was called back to present reality by the sound of Mary Sarojini'sshrill voice. \"Here we are!\"Will raised his head again. The little procession had turned off thehighway and was passing through an opening in a white stuccoed wall. Tothe left, on a rising succession of terraces, stood lines of low buildingsshaped by peepul trees. Straight ahead an avenue of tall palms slopeddown to a lotus pool, on the further side of which sat a huge stone Buddha.Turning to the left, they climbed between flowering trees and throughblending perfumes to the first terrace. Behind a fence, motionless exceptfor his ruminating jaws, stood a snow-white humped bull, godlike in hisserene and mindless beauty. Europa's lover receded into the past, andhere were a brace of Juno's birds trailing their feathers over the grass.Mary Sarojini unlatched the gate of a small garden.\"My bungalow,\" said Dr. MacPhail, and turning to Muru-gan, \"Let mehelp you to negotiate the steps.\"27TomKrishna and Mary Sarojini had gone to take their siesta with thegardener's children next door. In her darkened living room Susila MacPhailsat alone with her memories of past happiness and the present pain of herbereavement. The clock in the kitchen struck the half hour. It was time forher to go. With a sigh she rose, put on her sandals and walked out into thetremendous glare of the tropical afternoon. She looked up at the sky. Over"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"the volcanoes enormous clouds were climbing towards the zenith. In anhour it would be raining. Moving fromone pool of shadow to the next, shemade her way along the tree-lined path. With a sudden rattle of quills aflock of pigeons broke out of one of the towering peepul trees. Green-winged and coral-billed, their breasts changing color in the light like mother-of-pearl, they flew off towards the forest. How beautiful they were, howunutterably lovely! Susila was on the point of turning to catch theexpression of delight on Dugald's upturned face; then, checking herself,she looked down at the ground. There was no Dugald any more; there wasonly this pain, like the pain of the phantomlimb that goes on haunting theimagination,28Islandhaunting even the perceptions of those who have undergone anamputation. \"Amputation,\" she whispered to herself, \"amputation ...\"Feeling her eyes fill with tears, she broke off. Amputation was no excusefor self-pity and, for all that Dugald was dead, the birds were as beautiful asever and her children, all the other children-, had as much need to be lovedand helped and taught. If his absence was so constantly present, that wasto remind her that henceforward she must love for two, live for two, takethought for two, must perceive and understand not merely with her owneyes and mind but with the mind and eyes that had been his and, beforethe catastrophe, hers too in a communion of delight and intelligence.But here was the doctor's bungalow. She mounted the steps, crossedthe veranda and walked into the living room. Her father-in-law was seatednear the window, sipping cold tea froman earthenware mug and readingthe Revue tie Mycologie. He looked up as she approached, and gave her awelcomingsmile.\"Susila, my dear! I'm so glad you were able to come.\"She bent down and kissed his stubbly cheek.\"What's all this I hear from Mary Sarojini?\" she asked. \"Is it true shefound a castaway?\"\"From England—but via China, Rendang, and a shipwreck. Ajournalist.\"\"What's he like?\"\"The physique of a Messiah. But too clever to believe in God or beconvinced of his own mission. And too sensitive, even if he wereconvinced, to carry it out. His muscles would like to act and his feelings"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"would like to believe; but his nerve endings and his cleverness won't allowit.\"\"So I suppose he's very unhappy.\"\"So unhappy that he has to laugh like a hyena.\"\"Does he know he laughs like a hyena?\"29\"Knows and is rather proud of it. Even makes epigrams about it. 'I'mthe man who won't take yes for an answer.' \"\"Is he badly hurt?\" she asked.\"Not badly. But he's running a temperature. I've started him onantibiotics. Now it's up to you to raise his resistance and give the vismedicatrix naturae a chance.\"\"I'll do my best.\" Then, after a silence, \"I went to see Lak-shmi,\" shesaid, \"on my way back fromschool.\"\"How did you find her?\"\"About the same. No, perhaps a little weaker than yesterday/'\"That's what I felt when I saw her this morning.\"\"Luckily the pain doesn't seem to get any worse. We can still handle itpsychologically. And today we worked on the nausea. She was able todrink something. I don't think there'll be any more need for intravenousfluids.\"\"Thank goodness!\" he said. \"Those IV's were a torture. Suchenormous courage in the face of every real danger; but whenever it was aquestion of a hypodermic or a needle in a vein, the most abject andirrational terror.\"He thought of the time, in the early days of their marriage, when hehad lost his temper and called her a coward for making such a fuss.Lakshmi had cried and, having submitted to her martyrdom, had heapedcoals of fire upon his head by begging to be forgiven. \"Lakshmi, Lakshmi . ..\" And now in a few days she would be dead. After thirty-seven years.\"What did you talk about?\" he asked aloud.\"Nothing in particular,\" Susila answered. But the truth was that theyhad talked about Dugald and that she couldn't bring herself to repeat whathad passed between them. \"My first baby,\" the dying woman hadwhispered. \"I didn't know that babies could be so beautiful.\" In their skull-deep, skull-dark sockets the eyes had brightened, the bloodless lips hadsmiled. \"Such tiny, tiny hands,\" the faint hoarse voice went on, \"such a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"30Islandgreedy little mouth!\" And an almost fleshless hand tremblingly touched theplace where, before last year's operation, her breast had been. \"I neverknew,\" she repeated. And, before the event, how could she have known? Ithad been a revelation, an apocalypse of touch and love. \"Do you knowwhat I mean?\" And Susila had nodded. Of course she knew—had known itin relation to her own two children, known it, in those other apocalypses oftouch and love, with the man that little Dugald of the tiny hands and greedymouth had grown into. \"I used to be afraid for him,\" the dying woman hadwhispered. \"He was so strong, such a tyrant, he could have hurt and bulliedand destroyed. If he'd married another woman . . . I'm so thankful it wasyou!\" From the place where the breast had been the fleshless hand movedout and came to rest on Susila's arm. She had bent her head and kissed it.They were both crying.Dr. MacPhail sighed, looked up and, like a man who has climbed out ofthe water, gave himself a little shake. \"The castaway's name is Farnaby,\"he said. \"Will Farnaby.\"\"Will Farnaby,\" Susila repeated. \"Well, I'd better go and see what I cando for him.\" She turned and walked away.Dr. MacPhail looked after her, then leaned back in his chair and closedhis eyes. He thought of his son, he thought of his wife—of Lakshmi slowlywasting to extinction, of Dugald like a bright fiery flame suddenly snuffedout. Thought of the incomprehensible sequence of changes and chancesthat make up a life, all the beauties and horrors and absurdities whoseconjunctions create the uninterpretable and yet divinely significant patternof human destiny. \"Poor girl,\" he said to himself, remembering the look onSusila's face when he had told her of what had happened to Dugald, \"poorgirl!\" Meanwhile there was this article on Hallucinogenic mushrooms in theRevue de Mycologie. That was another of the irrelevancies that somehowtook its place in the pattern. The words of one of the old Raja's queer littlepoems came to his mind.31All things, to all things perfectly indifferent, perfectly work together indiscord for a Good beyond good, for a Being more timeless in transience,more eternal in its dwindling than God there in heaven.The door creaked, and an instant later Will heard light footsteps andthe rustle of skirts. Then a hand was laid on his shoulder and a woman's"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"voice, low-pitched and musical, asked himhow he was feeling.\"I'm feeling miserable,\" he answered without opening his eyes.There was no self-pity in his tone, no appeal for sympathy—only theangry matter-of-factness of a Stoic who has finally grown sick of the longfarce of impassibility and is resentfully blurting out the truth.\"I'm feeling miserable.\"The hand touched himagain. \"I'm Susila MacPhail,\" said the voice\"Mary Sarojini's mother.\"Reluctantly Will turned his head and opened his eyes. An adult, darkerversion of Mary Sarojini was sitting there beside the bed, smiling at himwith friendly solicitude. To smile back at her would have cost himtoo greatan effort; he contented himself with saying \"How do you do,\" then pulledthe sheet a little higher and closed his eyes again.Susila looked down at himin silence—at the bony shoulders, at the cageof ribs under a skin whose Nordic pallor made him seem, to her Palaneseeyes, so strangely frail and vulnerable, at the sunburnt face, emphaticallyfeatured like a carving intended to be seen at a distance—emphatic and yetsensitive, the quivering, more than naked face, she found herself thinking,of a man who has been flayed and left to suffer.32Island\"I hear you're from England,\" she said at last.\"I don't care where I'mfrom,\" Will muttered irritably. \"Nor where I'mgoing. From hell to hell.\"\"I was in England just after the war,\" she went on. \"As a student.\"He tried not to listen; but ears have no lids; there was no escape fromthat intruding voice.\"There was a girl in my psychology class,\" it was saying: \"her peoplelived at Wells. She asked me to stay with themfor the first month of thesummer vacation. Do you know Wells?\"Of course he knew Wells. Why did she pester himwith her sillyreminiscences?\"I used to love walking there by the water,\" Susila went on, \"lookingacross the moat at the cathedral\"—and thinking, while she looked at thecathedral, of Dugald under the palm trees on the beach, of Dugald givingher her first lesson in rock climbing. \"You're on the rope. You're perfectlysafe. You can't possibly fall ...\" Can't possibly fall, she repeated bitterly—and then remembered here and now, remembered that she had a job to do,remembered, as she looked again at the flayed emphatic face, that here"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"was a human being in pain. \"How lovely it was,\" she went on, \"and howmarvelously peaceful!\"The voice, it seemed to Will Farnaby, had become more musical andin some strange way more remote. Perhaps that was why he no longerresented its intrusion.\"Such an extraordinary sense of peace. Shanti, shanti, shanti. Thepeace that passes understanding.\"The voice was almost chanting now—chanting, it seemed, out of someother world.\"I can shut my eyes,\" it chanted on, \"can shut my eyes and see it all soclearly. Can see the church—and it's enormous, much taller than the hugetrees round the bishop's palace. Can see the green grass and the waterand the golden sunlight on the stones and the slanting shadows betweenthe buttresses. And lis-33ten! I can hear the bells. The bells and the jackdaws. The jackdaws in thetower—can you hear the jackdaws?\"Yes, he could hear the jackdaws, could hear themalmost as clearly ashe now heard those parrots in the trees outside his window. He was hereand at the same time he was there—here in this dark, sweltering room nearthe equator, but also there, outdoors in that cool hollow at the edge of theMendips, with the jackdaws calling from the cathedral tower and the soundof the bells dying away into the green silence.\"And there are white clouds,\" the voice was saying, \"and the blue skybetween them is so pale, so delicate, so exquisitely tender.\"Tender, he repeated, the tender blue sky of that April weekend he hadspent there, before the disaster of their marriage, with Molly. There weredaisies in the grass and dandelions, and across the water towered up thehuge church, challenging the wildness of those soft April clouds with itsaustere geometry. Challenging the wildness, and at the same timecomplementing it, coming to terms with it in perfect reconciliation. That washow it should have been with himself and Molly—how it had been then.\"And the swans,\" he now heard the voice dreamily chanting, \"theswans ...\"Yes, the swans. White swans moving across a mirror of jade and jet—a breathing mirror that heaved and trembled, so that their silvery imageswere forever breaking and coming together again, disintegrating and beingmade whole."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"\"Like the inventions of heraldry. Romantic, impossibly beautiful. Andyet there they are—real birds in a real place. So near to me now that I canalmost touch them—and yet so far away, thousands of miles away.

He could see themmoving across their dark mirror, couldhear the jackdaws in the tower, could catch, through this nearer mingling ofdisinfectants and gardenias, the cold, flat, weedy smell of that Gothic moatin the faraway green valley.\"Effortlessly floating.\"\"Effortlessly floating.\" The words gave him a deep satisfaction.\"I'd sit there,\" she was saying, \"I'd sit there looking and looking, and ina little while I'd be floating too. I'd be floating with the swans on that smoothsurface between the darkness below and the pale tender sky above.Floating at the same time on that other surface between here and far away,between then and now.\" And between remembered happiness, she wasthinking, and this insistent, excruciating presence of an absence. \"Floating,\"she said aloud, \"on the surface between the real and the imagined,between what comes to us fromthe outside and what comes to us fromwithin, fromdeep, deep down inhere.\"She laid her hand on his forehead, and suddenly the wordstransformed themselves into the things and events for which they stood;the images turned into facts. He actually was floating.\"Floating,\" the voice softly insisted. \"Floating like a white bird on thewater. Floating on a great river of life—a great smooth silent river that flowsso still, so still, you might almost think it was asleep. A sleeping river. But itflows irresistibly.\"Life flowing silently and irresistibly into ever fuller life, into a livingpeace all the more profound, all the richer and stronger and more completebecause it knows all your pain and unhappi-ness, knows them and takestheminto itself and makes themone with its own substance. And it's intothat peace that you're floating now, floating on this smooth silent river thatsleeps and is yet irresistible, and is irresistible precisely because it'ssleeping. And I'mfloating with it.\" She was speaking for the stranger. She"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"was speaking on another level for herself. \"Effortlessly floating. Not havingto do anything at all. Just letting go, just allowing myself35to be carried along, just asking this irresistible sleeping river of life to takeme where it's going—and knowing all the time that where it's going iswhere I want to go, where I have to go: into more life, into living peace.Along the sleeping river, irresistibly, into the wholeness of reconciliation.\"Involuntarily, unconsciously, Will Farnaby gave a deep sigh. How silentthe world had become! Silent with a deep crystalline silence, even thoughthe parrots were still busy out there beyond the shutters, even though thevoice still chanted here beside him! Silence and emptiness and through thesilence and the emptiness flowed the river, sleeping and irresistible.Susila looked down at the face on the pillow. It seemed suddenly veryyoung, childlike in its perfect serenity. The frowning lines across theforehead had disappeared. The lips that had been so tightly closed in painwere parted now, and the breath came slowly, softly, almost imperceptibly.She remembered suddenly the words that had come into her mind as shelooked down, one moonlit night, at the transfigured innocence of Dugald'sface: \"She giveth her beloved sleep.\" \"Sleep,\" she said aloud. \"Sleep.\"The silence seemed to become more absolute, the emptiness moreenormous.\"Asleep on the sleeping river,\" the voice was saying. \"And above theriver, in the pale sky, there are huge white clouds. And as you look at them,you begin to float up towards them. Yes, you begin to float up towardsthem, and the river now is a river in the air, an invisible river that carriesyou on, carries you up, higher and higher.\"Upwards, upwards through the silent emptiness. The image was thething, the words became the experience.\"Out of the hot plain,\" the voice went on, \"effortlessly, into thefreshness of the mountains.\"Yes, there was the Jungfrau, dazzlingly white against the blue. Therewas Monte Rosa . . .36Island\"How fresh the air feels as you breathe it. Fresh, pure, charged withlife!\"He breathed deeply and the new life flowed into him. And now a little"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"wind came blowing across the snowfields, cool against his skin, deliciouslycool. And, as though echoing his thoughts, as though describing hisexperience, the voice said, \"Coolness. Coolness and sleep. Throughcoolness into more life. Through sleep into reconciliation, into wholeness,into living peace.\"Half an hour later Susila re-entered the sitting room.\"Well?\" her father-in-law questioned. \"Any success?\"She nodded.\"I talked to him about a place in England,\" she said. \"He went off morequickly than I'd expected. After that I gave him some suggestions about histemperature ...\"\"And the knee, I hope.\"\"Of course.\"\"Direct suggestions?\"\"No, indirect. They're always better. I got himto be conscious of hisbody image. Then I made himimagine it much bigger than in everydayreality—and the knee much smaller. A miserable little thing in revolt againsta huge and splendid thing. There can't be any doubt as to who's going towin.\" She looked at the clock on the wall. \"Goodness, I must hurry.Otherwise I'll be late for my class at school.\"37The sun was just rising as Dr. Robert entered his wife's roomat thehospital. An orange glow, and against it the jagged silhouette of themountains. Then suddenly a dazzling sickle of incandescence between twopeaks. The sickle became a half circle and the first long shadows, the firstshafts of golden light crossed the garden outside the window. And whenone looked up again at the mountains there was the whole unbearableglory of the risen sun.Dr. Robert sat down by the bed, took his wife's hand and kissed it. Shesmiled at him, then turned again towards the window.\"How quickly the earth turns!\" she whispered, and then after a silence,\"One of these mornings,\" she added, \"it'll be my last sunrise.\"Through the confused chorus of bird cries and insect noises, a mynahwas chanting, \"Karuna.

Or will it be the strength ofarmor, the strength of shut-offness, the strength of being absorbed in yourwork and your ideas and not caring a damn for anything else? Rememberhow I used to come and pull your hair and make you pay attention? Who'sgoing to do that when I'm gone?\"A nurse came in with a glass of sugared water. Dr. Robert slid a handunder his wife's shoulders and lifted her to a sitting position. The nurse heldthe glass to her lips. Lakshmi drank a little water, swallowed with difficulty,then drank again and yet once more. Turning fromthe proffered glass, shelooked up at Dr. Robert. The wasted face was illumined by a strangelyincongruous twinkle of pure mischief.\" 'I the Trinity illustrate,' \" the faint voice hoarsely quoted, \" 'sippingwatered orange pulp; in three sips the Arian frustrate' . . .\" She broke off.\"What a ridiculous thing to be remembering. But then I always was prettyridiculous, wasn't I?\"Dr. Robert did his best to smile back at her. \"Pretty ridiculous,\" heagreed.\"You used to say I was like a flea. Here one moment and then, hop!somewhere else, miles away. No wonder you could never educate me!\"\"But you educated me all right,\" he assured her. \"If it hadn't been foryou coming in and pulling my hair and making me look at the world andhelping me to understand it, what would I be today? A pedant in blinkers—in spite of all my training. But luckily I had the sense to ask you to marryme, and luckily you had the folly to say yes and then the wisdomandintelligence to make a good job of me. After thirty-seven years of adulteducation I'malmost human.\"39\"But I'mstill a flea.\" She shook her head. \"And yet I did try. I tried veryhard. I don't know if you ever realized it, Robert: I was always on tiptoes,always straining up towards the place where you were doing your work andyour thinking and your reading. On tiptoes, trying to reach it, trying to get upthere beside you. Goodness, how tiring it was! What an endless series ofefforts! And all of themquite useless. Because I was just a dumb fleahopping about down here among the people and the flowers and the cats"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"and dogs. Your kind of highbrow world was a place I could never climb upto, much less find my way in. When this thing happened\" (she raised herhand again to her absent breast) \"I didn't have to try any more. No moreschool, no more homework. I had a permanent excuse.\"There was a long silence.\"What about taking another sip?\" said the nurse at last.\"Yes, you ought to drink some more,\" Dr. Robert agreed.\"And ruin the Trinity?\" Lakshmi gave himanother of her smiles.Through the mask of age and mortal sickness Dr. Robert suddenly saw thelaughing girl with whom, half a lifetime ago, and yet only yesterday, he hadfallen in love.An hour later Dr. Robert was back in his bungalow.\"You're going to be all alone this morning,\" he announced, afterchanging the dressing on Will Farnaby's knee. \"I have to drive down toShivapuram for a meeting of the Privy Council. One of our student nurseswill come in around twelve to give you your injection and get you somethingto eat. And in the afternoon, as soon as she's finished her work at theschool, Susila will be dropping in again. And now I must be going.\" Dr.Robert rose and laid his hand for a moment on Will's arm. \"Till thisevening.\" Halfway to the door he halted and turned back. \"I almost forgot togive you this.\" From one of the side pockets of his sagging jacket he pulledout a small green booklet. \"It's the40IslandOld Raja's Notes on What's What, and on What It Might beReasonable to Do about What's What.\"\"What an admirable title!\" said Will as he took the proffered book.\"And you'll like the contents, too,\" Dr. Robert assured him. \"Just a fewpages, that's all. But if you want to know what Pala is all about, there's nobetter introduction.\"\"Incidentally,\" Will asked, \"who is the Old Raja?\"\"Who was he, I'mafraid. The Old Raja died in 'thirty-eight—after areign three years longer than Queen Victoria's. His eldest son died beforehe did, and he was succeeded by his grandson, who was an ass—butmade up for it by being shortlived. The present Raja is his great-grandson.\"'\"And, if I may ask a personal question, how does anybody calledMacPhail come into the picture?\"\"The first MacPhail of Pala came into it under the Old Raja's"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"grandfather—the Raja of the Reform, we call him. Between them, he andmy great-grandfather invented modern Pala. The Old Raja consolidatedtheir work and carried it further. And today we're doing our best to follow inhis footsteps.\"Will held up the Notes on What's What.\"Does this give the history of the reforms?\"Dr. Robert shook his head. \"It merely states the underlying principles.Read about those first. When I get back from Shiva-puramthis evening, I'llgive you a taste of the history. You'll have a better understanding of whatwas actually done if you start by knowing what had to be done—whatalways and everywhere has to be done by anyone who has a clear ideaabout what's what. So read it, read it. And don't forget to drink your fruitjuice at eleven.\"Will watched himgo, then opened the little green book and started toread.41Nobody needs to go anywhere else. We are all, if we only knew it,already there.If I only knew who in fact I am, I should cease to behave as what Ithink I am; and if I stopped behaving as what I think I am, I should knowwho I am.What in fact I am, if only the Manichee I think I amwould allow me toknow it, is the reconciliation of yes and no lived out in total acceptance andthe blessed experience of Not-Two.In religion all words are dirty words. Anybody who gets eloquent aboutBuddha, or God, or Christ, ought to have his mouth washed out withcarbolic soap.Because his aspiration to perpetuate only the \"yes\" in every pair ofopposites can never, in the nature of things, be realized, the insulatedManichee I think I am condemns himself to endlessly repeated frustration,endlessly repeated conflicts with other aspiring and frustrated Manichees.Conflicts and frustrations—the theme of all history and almost allbiography. \"I show you sorrow,\" said the Buddha realistically. But he alsoshowed the ending of sorrow—self-knowledge, total acceptance, theblessed experience of Not-Two.Knowing who in fact we are results in Good Being, and Good Beingresults in the most appropriate kind of good doing. But good doing does notof itself result in Good Being. We can be virtuous without knowing who in"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"fact we are. The beings who are merely good are not Good Beings; theyare just pillars of society.Most pillars are their own Samsons. They hold up, but sooner or laterthey pull down. There has never been a society in which most good doingwas the product of Good Being and therefore constantly appropriate. Thisdoes not mean that there will never be such a society or that we in Pala arefools for trying to call it into existence.42IslandThe Yogin and the Stoic—two righteous egos who achieve their veryconsiderable results by pretending, systematically, to be somebody else.But it is not by pretending to be somebody else, even somebody supremelygood and wise, that we can pass frominsulated Manichee-hood to GoodBeing.Good Being is knowing who in fact we are; and in order to know who infact we are, we must first know, moment by moment, who we think we areand what this bad habit of thought compels us to feel and do. A moment ofclear and complete knowledge of what we think we are, but in fact are not,puts a stop, for the moment, to the Manichean charade. If we renew, untilthey become a continuity, these moments of the knowledge of what we arenot, we may find ourselves, all of a sudden, knowing who in fact we are.Concentration, abstract thinking, spiritual exercises-systematicexclusions in the realm of thought. Asceticismand hedonism—systematicexclusions in the realms of sensation, feeling and action. But Good Being isin the knowledge of who in fact one is in relation to all experiences. So beaware—aware in every context, at all times and whatever, creditable ordiscreditable, pleasant or unpleasant, you may be doing or suffering. Thisis the only genuine yoga, the only spiritual exercise worth practicing.The more a man knows about individual objects, the more he43knows about God. Translating Spinoza's language into ours, we can say:The more a man knows about himself in relation to every kind ofexperience, the greater his chance of suddenly, one fine morning, realizingwho in fact he is—or rather Who (capital W) in Fact (capital F) \"he\"(between quotation marks) Is (capital I).St. John was right. In a blessedly speechless universe, the Word wasnot only with God; it was God. As a something to be believed in. God is a"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"projected symbol, a reified name. God = \"God.\"Faith is something very different from belief. Belief is the systematictaking of unanalyzed words much too seriously. Paul's words,Mohammed's words, Marx's words, Hitler's words—people take themtooseriously, and what happens? What happens is the senseless ambivalenceof history—sadism versus duty, or (incomparably worse) sadismas duty;devotion counterbalanced by organized paranoia; sisters of charityselflessly tending the victims of their own church's inquisitors andcrusaders. Faith, on the contrary, can never be taken too seriously. ForFaith is the empirically justified confidence in our capacity to know who infact we are, to forget the belief-intoxicated Manichee in Good Being. Giveus this day our daily Faith, but deliver us, dear God, from Belief.There was a tap at the door. Will looked up from his book.\"Who's there?\"\"It's me,\" said a voice that brought back unpleasant memories ofColonel Dipa and that nightmarish drive in the white Mercedes. Dressedonly in white sandals, white shorts, and a platinumwrist watch, Muruganwas advancing towards the bed.\"How nice of you to come and see me!\"Another visitor would have asked himhow he was feeling; butMurugan was too wholeheartedly concerned with himself to be able even tosimulate the slightest interest in anyone else. \"I44Islandcame to the door three-quarters of an hour ago,\" he said in tones ofaggrieved complaint. \"But the old man hadn't left, so I had to go homeagain. And then I had to sit with my mother and the man who's staying withus while they were having their breakfast...\"\"Why couldn't you come in while Dr. Robert was here?\" Will asked. \"Isit against the rules for you to talk to me?\"The boy shook his head impatiently. \"Of course not. I just didn't wanthimto know the reason for my coming to see you.\"\"The reason?\" Will smiled. \"Visiting the sick is an act of charity—highlycommendable.\"His irony was lost upon Murugan, who went on steadily thinking abouthis own affairs. \"Thank you for not telling them you'd seen me before,\" hesaid abruptly, almost angrily. It was as though he resented having toacknowledge his obligation and were furious with Will for having done himthe good turn which demanded this acknowledgment."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"\"I could see you didn't want me to say anything about it,\" said Will. \"Soof course I didn't.\"\"I wanted to thank you,\" Murugan muttered between his teeth and in atone that would have been appropriate to \"You dirty swine!\"\"Don't mention it,\" said Will with mock politeness.What a delicious creature! he was thinking as he looked, with amusedcuriosity, at that smooth golden torso, that averted face, regular as astatue's but no longer Olympian, no longer classical—-a Hellenistic face,mobile and all too human. A vessel of incomparable beauty—but what did itcontain? It was a pity, he reflected, that he hadn't asked that question alittle more seriously before getting involved with his unspeakable Babs. Butthen Babs was a female. By the sort of heterosexual he was, the sort ofrational question he was now posing was unaskable. As no doubt it wouldbe, by anyone susceptible to boys, in regard to this bad-blooded littledemigod sitting at the end of his bed.45\"Didn't Dr. Robert know you'd gone to Rendang?\" he asked.\"Of course he knew. Everybody knew it. I'd gone there to fetch mymother. She was staying there with some of her relations. I went over tobring her back to Pala. It was absolutely official.\"\"Then why didn't you want me to say that I'd met you over there?\"Murugan hesitated for a moment, then looked up at Will defiantly.\"Because I didn't want them to know I'd been seeing Colonel Dipa.\"Oh, so that was it! \"Colonel Dipa's a remarkable man,\" he said aloud,fishing with sugared bait for confidences.Surprisingly unsuspicious, the fish rose at once. Murugan's sulky facelit up with enthusiasm and there, suddenly, was Anti-nous in all thefascinating beauty of his ambiguous adolescence. \"I think he's wonderful,\"he said, and for the first time since he had entered the room he seemed torecognize Will's existence and give himthe friendliest of smiles. TheColonel's wonderful-ness had made himforget his resentment, had made itpossible for him, momentarily, to love everybody—even this man to whomhe owed a rankling debt of gratitude. \"Look at what he's doing forRendang!\"\"He's certainly doing a great deal for Rendang,\" said Willnoncommittally.A cloud passed across Murugan's radiant face. \"They don't think sohere,\" he said, frowning. \"They think he's awful.\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"\"Who thinks so?\"\"Practically everybody!\" ;! \"So they didn't want you to see him?\"With the expression of an urchin who has cocked a snook while theteacher's back is turned, Murugan grinned triumphantly. \"They thought Iwas with my mother all the time.\"Will picked up the cue at once. \"Did your mother know you wereseeing the Colonel?\" he asked.46Island\"Of course.\" \"And had no objection?\" \"She was all for it.\"And yet, Will felt quite sure, he hadn't been mistaken when he thoughtof Hadrian and Antinous. Was the woman blind? Or didn't she wish to seewhat was happening?\"But if she doesn't mind,\" he said aloud, \"why should Dr. Robert andthe rest of them object?\" Murugan looked at himsuspiciously. Realizingthat he had ventured too far into forbidden territory, Will hastily drew a redherring across the trail. \"Do they think,\" he asked with a laugh, \"that hemight convert you to a belief in military dictatorship?\"The red herring was duly followed, and the boy's face relaxed into asmile. \"Not that, exactly,\" he answered, \"but something like it. It's all sostupid,\" he added with a shrug of the shoulders. \"Just idiotic protocol.\"\"Protocol?\" Will was genuinely puzzled.\"Weren't you told anything about me?\"\"Only what Dr. Robert said yesterday.\"\"You mean, about my being a student?\" Murugan threw back his headand laughed.\"What's so funny about being a student?\"\"Nothing—nothing at all.\" The boy looked away again. There was asilence. Still averted, \"The reason,\" he said at last, \"why I'm not supposedto see Colonel Dipa is that he's the head of a state and I'm the head of astate. When we meet, it's international politics.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"I happen to be the Raja of Pala.\"\"TheRajaofPala?\"\"Since 'fifty-four. That was when my father died.\"\"And your mother, I take it, is the Rani?\"\"My mother is the Rani.\"Make a beelinefor the palace. But here was the palace making"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"47a beeline for him. Providence, evidently, was on the side of Joe Aldehydeand working overtime.\"Were you the eldest son?\" he asked.\"The only son,\" Murugan replied. And then, stressing his uniquenessstill more emphatically, \"The only child,'1'' he added.\"So there's no possible doubt,\" said Will. \"My goodness! I ought to becalling you Your Majesty. Or at least Sir.\" The words were spokenlaughingly; but it was with the most perfect seriousness and a suddenassumption of regal dignity that Murugan responded to them.\"You'll have to call me that at the end of next week,\" he said. \"After mybirthday. I shall be eighteen. That's when a Raja of Pala comes of age. Tillthen I'mjust Murugan Mailendra. Just a student learning a little bit abouteverything—including plant breeding,\" he added contemptuously—\"so that,when the time comes, I shall know what I'm doing.\"\"And when the time comes, what will you be doing?\" Between thispretty Antinous and his portentous office there was a contrast which Willfound richly comic. \"How do you propose to act?\" he continued on abantering note. \"Off with their heads? L'etat c'est moi?\"Seriousness and regal dignity hardened into rebuke. \"Don't be stupid.\"Amused, Will went through the motions of apology. \"I just wanted tofind out how absolute you were going to be.\"\"Pala is a constitutional monarchy,\" Murugan answered gravely.\"In other words, you're just going to be a symbolic figurehead—toreign, like the Queen of England, but not rule.\"Forgetting his regal dignity, \"No, no\" Murugan almost screamed. \"Notlike the Queen of England. The Raja of Pala doesn't just reign; he rules.\"Too much agitated to sit still, Murugan jumped up and began to walk aboutthe room. \"He rules constitutionally; but, by God, he rules, he rules!\"Murugan48Island49walked to the window and looked out. Turning back after a moment ofsilence, he confronted Will with a face transfigured by its new expressioninto an emblem, exquisitely molded and colored, of an all too familiar kindof psychological ugliness. \"I'll show themwho's the boss around here,\" he"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"said in a phrase and tone which had obviously been borrowed from thehero of some American gangster movie. \"These people think they can pushme around,\" he went on, reciting fromthe dismally commonplace script,\"the way they pushed my father around. But they're making a big mistake.\"He uttered a sinister snigger and wagged his beautiful, odious head. \"A bigmistake,\" he repeated.The words had been spoken between clenched teeth and with scarcelymoving lips; the lower jaw had been thrust out so as to look like the jaw of acomic strip criminal; the eyes glared coldly between narrowed lids. At onceabsurd and horrible. Antinous had become the caricature of all the toughguys in all the B-pictures fromtime immemorial.\"Who's been running the country during your minority?\" he now asked.\"Three sets of old fogeys,\" Murugan answered contemptuously. \"TheCabinet, the House of Representatives and then, representing me, theRaja, the Privy Council.\"\"Poor old fogeys!\" said Will. \"They'll soon be getting the shock of theirlives.\" Entering gaily into the spirit of delinquency, he laughed aloud. \"I onlyhope I'll still be around to see it happening.\"Murugan joined in the laughter—joined in it, not as the sin-isterlymirthful Tough Guy, but with one of those sudden changes of mood andexpression that would make it, Will foresaw, so hard for himto play theTough Guy part, as the triumphant urchin of a few minutes earlier. \"Theshock of their lives,\" he repeated happily.\"Have you made any specific plans?\"\"I most certainly have,\" said Murugan. On his mobile face thetriumphant urchin made way for the statesman, grave but condescendinglyaffable, at a press conference. \"Top priority: get this place modernized.Look at what Rendang has been able to do because of its oil royalties.\"\"But doesn't Pala get any oil royalties?\" Will questioned with thatinnocent air of total ignorance which he had found by long experience to bethe best way of eliciting information from the simpleminded and the self-important.\"Not a penny,\" said Murugan. \"And yet the southern end of the islandis fairly oozing with the stuff. But except for a few measly little wells forhome consumption, the old fogeys won't do anything about it. And what'smore, they won't allow anyone else to do anything about it.\" The statesmanwas growing angry; there were hints now in his voice and expression of theTough Guy. \"All sorts of people have made offers—Southeast AsiaPetroleum, Shell, Royal Dutch, Standard of California. But the bloody oldfools won't listen.\""},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"\"Can't you persuade themto listen?\"\"I'll damn well make them listen,\" said the Tough Guy.\"That's the spirit!\" Then, casually, \"Which of the offers do you think ofaccepting?\" he asked.\"Colonel Dipa's working with Standard of California, and he thinks itmight be best if we did the same.\"\"I wouldn't do that without at least getting a few competing bids.\"\"That's what I think too. So does my mother.\"\"Very wise.\"\"My mother's all for Southeast Asia Petroleum. She knows theChairman of the Board, Lord Aldehyde.\"\"She knows Lord Aldehyde? But how extraordinary!\" The tone ofdelighted astonishment was thoroughly convincing. \"Joe Aldehyde is afriend of mine. I write for his papers. I even serve50Islandas his private ambassador. Confidentially,\" he added, \"that's why we tookthat trip to the copper mines. Copper is one of Joe's sidelines. But ofcourse his real love is oil.\"Murugan tried to look shrewd. \"What would he be prepared to offer?\"Will picked up the cue and answered, in the best movie -tycoon style,\"Whatever Standard offers plus a little more.\"\"Fair enough,\" said Murugan out of the same script, and noddedsagely. There was a long silence. When he spoke again, it was as thestatesman granting an interview to representatives of the press.\"The oil royalties,\" he said, \"will be used in the following manner:twenty-five percent of all moneys received will go to World Reconstruction.\"\"May I ask,\" Will enquired deferentially, \"precisely how you propose toreconstruct the world?\"\"Through the Crusade of the Spirit. Do you know about the Crusade ofthe Spirit?\"\"Of course. Who doesn't?\"\"It's a great world movement,\" said the statesman gravely. \"Like EarlyChristianity. Founded by my mother.\"Will registered awe and astonishment.\"Yes, founded by my mother,\" Murugan repeated, and he addedimpressively, \"I believe it's man's only hope.\"\"Quite,\" said Will Farnaby, \"quite.\"\"Well, that's how the first twenty-five percent of the royalties will be"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"used,\" the statesman continued. \"The remainder will go into an intensiveprogramof industrialization.\" The tone changed again. \"These old idiotshere only want to industrialize in spots and leave all the rest as it was athousand years ago.\"\"Whereas you'd like to go the whole hog. Industrialization forindustrialization's sake.\"\"No, industrialization for the country's sake. Industrialization to makePala strong. To make other people respect us. Look51at Rendang. Within five years they'll be manufacturing all the rifles andmortars and ammunition they need. It'll be quite a long time before they canmake tanks. But meanwhile they can buy them from Skoda with their oilmoney.\"\"How soon will they graduate to H-bombs?\" Will asked ironically.\"They won't even try,\" Murugan answered. \"But after all,\" he added,\"H-bombs aren't the only absolute weapons.\" He pronounced the phrasewith relish. It was evident that he found the taste of \"absolute weapons\"positively delicious. \"Chemical and biological weapons—Colonel Dipa callsthemthe poor man's H-bombs. One of the first things I'll do is to build a biginsecticide plant.\" Murugan laughed and winked an eye. \"If you can makeinsecticides,\" he said, \"you can make nerve gas.\"Will remembered that still unfinished factory in the suburbs ofRendang-Lobo.\"What's that?\" he had asked Colonel Dipa as they flashed past it in thewhite Mercedes.\"Insecticides,\" the Colonel had answered. And showing his gleamingwhite teeth in a genial smile, \"We shall soon be exporting the stuff all overSoutheast Asia.\"At the time, of course, he had thought that the Colonel merely meantwhat he said. But now . . . Will shrugged his mental shoulders. Colonels willbe colonels and boys, even boys like Murugan, will be gun-loving boys.There would always be plenty of jobs for special correspondents on the trailof death.\"So you'll strengthen Pala's army?\" Will said aloud.\"Strengthen it? No—I'll create it. Pala doesn't have an army.\"\"None at all?\"\"Absolutely nothing. They're all pacifists.\" The p was an explosion ofdisgust, the s's hissed contemptuously. \"I shall have to start fromscratch.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"\"And you'll militarize as you industrialize, is that it?\"52Island\"Exactly.\"Will laughed. \"Back to the Assyrians! You'll go down in history as atrue revolutionary.\"\"That's what I hope,\" said Murugan. \"Because that's what my policy isgoing to be—Continuing Revolution.\"\"Very good!\" Will applauded.\"I'll just be continuing the revolution that was started more than ahundred years ago by Dr. Robert's great-grandfather when he came toPala and helped my great-great-grandfather to put through the first reforms.Some of the things they did were really wonderful. Not all of them, mindyou,\" he qualified; and with the absurd solemnity of a schoolboy playingPolonius in an end-of-term performance of Hamlet he shook his curly headin grave, judicial disapproval. \"But at least they did something. Whereasnowadays we're governed by a set of do-nothing conservatives.Conservatively primitive—they won't lift a finger to bring in modernimprovements. And conservatively radical—they refuse to change any ofthe old bad revolutionary ideas that ought to be changed. They won'treformthe reforms. And I tell you, some of those so-called reforms areabsolutely disgusting.\"\"Meaning, I take it, that they have something to do with sex?\"Murugan nodded and turned away his face. To his astonishment, Willsaw that he was blushing.\"Give me an example,\" he demanded.But Murugan could not bring himself to be explicit.\"Ask Dr. Robert,\" he said, \"ask Vijaya. They think that sort of thing issimply wonderful. In fact they all do. That's one of the reasons why nobodywants to change. They'd like everything to go on as it is, in the same olddisgusting way, forever and ever.\"\"Forever and ever,\" a rich contralto voice teasingly repeated.\"Mother!\" Murugan sprang to his feet.Will turned and saw in the doorway a large florid woman swathed(rather incongruously, he thought; for that kind of face and build usuallywent with mauve and magenta and electric53"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"blue) in clouds of white muslin. She stood there smiling with a consciousmysteriousness, one fleshy brown arm upraised, with its jeweled handpressed against the doorjamb, in the pose of the great actress, theacknowledged diva, pausing at her first entrance to accept the plaudits ofher adorers on the other side of the footlights. In the background, waitingpatiently for his cue, stood a tall man in a dove-gray Dacron suit whomMurugan, peering past the massive embodiment of maternity that almostfilled the doorway, now greeted as Mr. Bahu.Still in the wings, Mr. Bahu bowed without speaking.Murugan turned again to his mother. \"Did you walk here?\" he asked.His tone expressed incredulity and an admiring solicitude. Walking here—how unthinkable! But if she had walked, what heroism! \"All the way?\"\"All the way, my baby,\" she echoed, tenderly playful. The uplifted armcame down, slid round the boy's slender body, pressed it, engulfed infloating draperies, against the enormous bosom, then released it again. \"Ihad one of my Impulses.\" She had a way, Will noticed, of making youactually hear the capital letters at the beginning of the words she meant toemphasize. \"My Little Voice said, 'Go and see this Stranger at Dr. Robert'shouse. Go!' 'Now?' I said. ''Malgre la chaleur? Which makes my Little Voicelose patience. 'Woman,' it says, 'hold your silly tongue and do as you'retold.' So here I am, Mr. Farnaby.\" With hand outstretched and surroundedby a powerful aura of sandal-wood oil, she advanced towards him.Will bowed over the thick bejeweled ringers and mumbled somethingthat ended in \"Your Highness.\"\"Bahu!\" she called, using the royal prerogative of the unadornedsurname.Responding to his long-awaited cue, the supporting actor made hisentrance and was introduced as His Excellency, Abdul Bahu, theAmbassador of Rendang: \"Abdul Pierre Bahu—car sa mere est parisienne.But he learned his English in New York.\"54IslandHe looked, Will thought as he shook the Ambassador's hand, likeSavonarola—but a Savonarola with a monocle and a tailor in Savile Row.\"Bahu,\" said the Rani, \"is Colonel Dipa's Brains Trust.\"\"Your Highness, if I may be permitted to say so, is much too kind to meand not nearly kind enough to the Colonel.\"His words and manner were courtly to the point of being ironical, aparody of deference and self-abasement."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"\"The brains,\" he went on, \"are where brains ought to be—in the head.As for me, I ammerely a part of Rendang's sympathetic nervous system.\"\"Et combien sympathique!\" said the Rani. \"Among other things, Mr.Farnaby, Bahu is the Last of the Aristocrats. You should see his countryplace! Like The Arabian Nights! One claps one's hands—and instantlythere are six servants ready to do one's bidding. One has a birthday—andthere is a fete nocturne in the gardens. Music, refreshments, dancing girls;two hundred retainers carrying torches. The life of Harun al-Rashid, butwith modern plumbing.\"\"It sounds quite delightful,\" said Will, remembering the villages throughwhich he had passed in Colonel Dipa's white Mercedes—the wattled huts,the garbage, the children with ophthalmia, the skeleton dogs, the womenbent double under enormous loads.\"And such taste,\" the Rani went on, \"such a well-stored mind and,through it all\" (she lowered her voice) \"such a deep and unfailing Sense ofthe Divine.\"Mr. Bahu bowed his head, and there was a silence.Murugan, meanwhile, had pushed up a chair. Without so much as abackward glance—regally confident that someone must always, in the verynature of things, be at hand to guard against mishaps and loss of dignity—the Rani sat down with all the majestic emphasis of her hundred kilograms.\"I hope you don't feel that my visit is an intrusion,\" she said55to Will. He assured her that he didn't; but she continued to apologize. \"Iwould have given warning,\" she said, \"I would have asked your permission.But my Little Voice says, 'No—you must go now.' Why? I cannot say. Butno doubt we shall find out in due course.\" She fixed him with her large,bulging eyes and gave hima mysterious smile. \"And now, first of all, howare you, dear Mr. Farnaby?\"\"As you see, ma'am, in very good shape.\"\"Truly?\" The bulging eyes scrutinized his face with an intent-ness thathe found embarrassing. \"I can see that you're the kind of heroicallyconsiderate man who will go on reassuring his friends even on hisdeathbed.\"\"You're very flattering,\" he said. \"But as it happens, I am in goodshape. Amazingly so, all things considered—miraculously so.\"\"Miraculous,\" said the Rani, \"was the very word I used when I heardabout your escape. It was a miracle.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"\" 'As luck would have it,' \" Will quoted again fromErewhon, \"'Providence was on my side.' \"Mr. Bahu started to laugh; but noticing that the Rani had evidentlyfailed to get the point, changed his mind and adroitly turned the sound ofmerriment into a loud cough.\"How true!\" the Rani was saying, and her rich contralto thrillinglyvibrated. \"Providence is always on our side.\" And when Will raised aquestioning eyebrow, \"I mean,\" she elaborated, \"in the eyes of those whoTruly Understand\" (capital T, capital U). \"And this is true even when allthings seemto conspire against us—meme dans le desastre. Youunderstand French, of course, Mr. Farnaby?\" Will nodded. \"It often comesto me more easily than my own native tongue, or English or Palanese. Afterso many years in Switzerland,\" she explained, \"first at school. And again,later on, when my poor baby's health was so precarious\" (she pattedMurugan's bare arm) \"and we had to go and live in the mountains. Whichillustrates what I was saying56Islandabout Providence always being on our side. When they told me that mylittle boy was on the brink of consumption, I forgot everything I'd everlearnt. I was mad with fear and anguish, I was indignant against God forhaving allowed such a thing to happen. What Utter Blindness! My baby gotwell, and those years among the Eternal Snows were the happiest of ourlives—weren't they, darling?\"\"The happiest of our lives,\" the boy agreed, with what almost soundedlike complete sincerity.The Rani smiled triumphantly, pouted her full red lips, and with a faintsmack parted them again in a long-distance kiss. \"So you see, my dearFarnaby,\" she went on, \"you see. It's really self-evident. Nothing happensby Accident. There's a Great Plan, and within the Great Plan innumerablelittle plans. A little plan for each and every one of us.\"\"Quite,\" said Will politely. \"Quite.\"\"There was a time,\" the Rani continued, \"when I knew it only with myintellect. Now I know it with my heart. I really ...\" she paused for an instantto prepare for the utterance of the mystic majuscule, \"Understand.\"\"Psychic as hell.\" Will remembered what Joe Aldehyde had said of her.And surely that lifelong frequenter of seances should know.\"I take it, ma'am,\" he said, \"that you're naturally psychic.\"\"From birth,\" she admitted. \"But also and above all by training."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Training, needless to say, in Something Else.\"\"Something else?\"\"In the life of the Spirit. As one advances along the Path, all the sidhis,all the psychic gifts and miraculous powers, develop spontaneously.\"\"Is that so?\"\"My mother,\" Murugan proudly assured him, \"can do the most fantasticthings.\"\"N'exagerons pas, cheri.\"57\"But it's the truth,\" Murugan insisted.\"A truth,\" the Ambassador put in, \"which I can confirm. And I confirmit,\" he added, smiling at his own expense, \"with a certain reluctance. As alifelong skeptic about these things, I don't like to see the impossiblehappening. But I have an unfortunate weakness for honesty. And when theimpossible actually does happen, before my eyes, I'mcompelled malgremoi to bear witness to the fact. Her Highness does do the most fantasticthings.\"\"Well, if you like to put it that way,\" said the Rani, beaming withpleasure. \"But never forget, Bahu, never forget. Miracles are of absolutelyno importance. What's important is the Other Thing—the Thing one comesto at the end of the Path.\"\"After the Fourth Initiation,\" Murugan specified. \"My mother ...\"\"Darling!\" The Rani had raised a finger to her lips. \"These are thingsone doesn't talk about.\"\"I'm sorry,\" said the boy. There was a long and pregnant silence.The Rani closed her eyes, and Mr. Bahu, letting fall his monocle,reverentially followed suit and became the image of Savonarola in silentprayer. What was going on behind that austere, that almost fleshless maskof recollectedness? Will looked and wondered.\"May I ask,\" he said at last, \"how you first came, ma'am, to find thePath?\"For a second or two the Rani said nothing, merely sat there with hereyes shut, smiling her Buddha smile of mysterious bliss. \"Providence foundit for me,\" she answered at last.\"Quite, quite. But there must have been an occasion, a place, a humaninstrument.\"\"I'll tell you.\" The lids fluttered apart and once again he found himselfunder the bright unswerving glare of those protu-! berant eyes of hers."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"58IslandThe place had been Lausanne; the time, the first year of her Swisseducation; the chosen instrument, darling little Mme Buloz. Darling littleMme Buloz was the wife of darling old Professor Buloz, and old ProfessorBuloz was the man to whose charge, after careful enquiry and muchanxious thought, she had been committed by her father, the late Sultan ofRendang. The Professor was sixty-seven, taught geology and was aProtestant of so austere a sect that, except for drinking a glass of claretwith his dinner, saying his prayers only twice a day, and being strictlymonogamous, he might almost have been a Muslim. Under suchguardianship a princess of Rendang would be intellectually stimulated,while remaining morally and doctrinally intact. But the Sultan had reckonedwithout the Professor's wife. Mme Buloz was only forty, plump, sentimental,bubblingly enthusiastic and, though officially of her husband's Protestantpersuasion, a newly converted and intensely ardent Theosophist. In a roomat the top of the tall house near the Place de la Riponne she had herOratory, to which, whenever she could find time, she would secretly retireto do breathing exercises, practice concentration, and raise Kundalini.Strenuous disciplines! But the reward was transcendentally great. In thesmall hours of a hot summer night, while the darling old Professor layrhythmically snoring two floors down, she had become aware of aPresence: the Master Koot Hoomi was with her.The Rani made an impressive pause. \"Extraordinary,\" said Mr. Bahu.\"Extraordinary,\" Will dutifully echoed. The Rani resumed her narrative.Irrepressibly happy, Mme Buloz had been unable to keep her secret. Shehad dropped mysterious hints, had passed from hints to confidences, fromconfidences toaninvitation to the Oratory and a courseofinstruction. In a very short time Koot Hoomi was bestowing greater favorsupon the novice than upon her teacher.59\"And fromthat day to this,\" she concluded, \"the Master has helped meto Go Forward.\"To go forward, Will asked himself, into what? Koot Hoomi only knew.But whatever it was that she had gone forward into, he didn't like it. Therewas an expression on that large florid face which he found peculiarlydistasteful—an expression of domineering calm, of serene and unshakable"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"self-esteem. She reminded himin a curious way of Joe Aldehyde. Joe wasone of those happy tycoons who feel no qualms, but rejoice withoutinhibition in their money and in all that their money will buy in the way ofinfluence and power. And here—albeit clothed in white muslin, mystic,wonderful—was another of Joe Aldehyde's breed: a female tycoon whohad cornered the market, not in soya beans or copper, but in PureSpirituality and the Ascended Masters, and was now happily rubbing herhands over the exploit.\"Here's one example of what He's done for me,\" the Rani went on.\"Eight years ago—to be exact, on the twenty-third of November, 1952—theMaster came to me in my morning Meditation. Came in Person, came inGlory. 'A great Crusade is to be launched,' He said, 'a World Movement tosave Humanity from self-destruction. And you, my child, are the AppointedInstrument.' 'Me? A World Movement? But that's absurd,' I said. 'I've nevermade a speech in my whole life. I've never written a word for publication.I've never been a leader or an organizer.' 'Nevertheless,' He said (and Hegave one of these indescribably beautiful smiles of His), 'nevertheless it isyou who will launch this Crusade—the World-Wide Crusade of the Spirit.You will be laughed at, you will be called a fool, a crank, a fanatic. Thedogs bark; the Caravan passes. Fromtiny, laughable beginnings theCrusade of the Spirit is destined to become a Mighty Force. A force forGood, a force that will ultimately Save the World.' And with that He left me.Left me stunned, bewildered, scared out of60Islandmy wits. But there was nothing for it; I had to obey. I did obey. And whathappened? I made speeches, and He gave me eloquence. I accepted theburden of leadership and, because He was walking invisibly at my side,people followed me. I asked for help, and the money came pouring in. Sohere I am.\" She threw out her thick hands in a gesture of self-depreciation,she smiled a mystic smile. A poor thing, she seemed to be saying, but notmy own—my Master's, Koot Hoomi's. \"Here I am,\" she repeated. \"Here,praise God,\" said Mr. Bahu devoutly, \"you are.\" After a decent interval Willasked the Rani if she had always kept up the practices so providentiallylearned in Mme Buloz's Oratory.\"Always,\" she answered. \"I could no more do without Meditation than Icould do without Food.\"\"Wasn't it rather difficult after you were married? I mean, before youwent back to Switzerland. There must have been so many tiresome official"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"duties.\"\"Not to mention all the unofficial ones,\" said the Rani in a tone thatimplied whole volumes of unfavorable comment upon her late husband'scharacter, Weltanschauung and sexual habits. She opened her mouth toelaborate on the theme, then closed it again and looked at Murugan.\"Darling,\" she called.Murugan, who was absorbedly polishing the nails of his left hand uponthe open palmof his right, looked up with a guilty start. \"Yes, Mother?\"Ignoring the nails and his evident inattention to what she had beensaying, the Rani gave hima seducing smile. \"Be an angel,\" she said, \"andgo and fetch the car. My Little Voice doesn't say anything about walkingback to the bungalow. It's only a few hundred yards,\" she explained to Will.\"But in this heat, and at my age . . .\"Her words called for some kind of flattering rebuttal. But if it was toohot to walk, it was also too hot, Will felt, to put forth the very considerableamount of energy required for a convincing61show of bogus sincerity. Fortunately a professional diplomat, a practicedcourtier was on hand to make up for the uncouth journalist's deficiencies.Mr. Bahu uttered a peal of lighthearted laughter, then apologized for hismerriment.\"But it was really too funny! 'At my age,' \" he repeated, and laughedagain. \"Murugan is not quite eighteen, and I happen to know how old—howvery young—the Princess of Rendang was when she married the Raja ofPala.\"Murugan, meanwhile, had obediently risen and was kissing hismother's hand.\"Now we can talk more freely,\" said the Rani when he had left theroom. And freely—her face, her tone, her bulging eyes, her whole quiveringframe registering the most intense disapproval—she now let fly. Demortuis. . . She wouldn't say anything about her husband except that hewas a typical Palanese, a true representative of his country. For the sadtruth was that Pala's smooth bright skin concealed the most horriblerottenness.\"When I think what they tried to do to my Baby, two years ago, when Iwas on my world tour for the Crusade of the Spirit.\" With a jingling ofbracelets she lifted her hands in horror. \"It was an agony for me to beparted fromhimfor so long; but the Master had sent me on a Mission, and"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"my Little Voice told me that it wouldn't be right for me to take my Baby withme. He'd lived abroad for so long. It was high time for him to get to knowthe country he was to rule. So I decided to leave himhere. The PrivyCouncil appointed a committee of guardianship. Two women with growingboys of their own and two men—one of whom, I regret to say\" (more insorrow than in anger), \"was Dr. Robert MacPhail. Well, to cut a long storyshort, no sooner was I safely out of the country than those preciousguardians, to whomI'd entrusted my Baby, my Only Son, set to worksystematically—systematically, Mr. Farnaby—to undermine my influence.They tried to destroy the whole edifice of Moral and Spiritual Values which Ihad so laboriously built up over the years.\"62IslandSomewhat maliciously (for of course he knew what the woman wastalking about), Will expressed his astonishment. The whole edifice of moraland spiritual values? And yet nobody could have been kinder than Dr.Robert and the others, no Good Samaritans were ever more simply andeffectively charitable.\"I'mnot denying their kindness,\" said the Rani. \"But after all kindnessisn't the only virtue.\"\"Of course not,\" Will agreed, and he listed all the qualities that the Raniseemed most conspicuously to lack. \"There's also sincerity. Not to mentiontruthfulness, humility, selflessness . . .\"\"You're forgetting Purity,\" said the Rani severely. \"Purity isfundamental, Purity is the sine qua, non.\"\"But here in Pala, I gather, they don't think so.\"\"They most certainly do not,\" said the Rani. And she went on to tell himhow her poor Baby had been deliberately exposed to impurity, evenactively encouraged to indulge in it with one of those precocious,promiscuous girls of whom, in Pala, there were only too many. And whenthey found that he wasn't the sort of boy who would seduce a girl (for shehad brought himup to think of Woman as essentially Holy), they hadencouraged the girl to do her best to seduce him.Had she, Will wondered, succeeded? Or had Antinoiis already beengirlproofed by little friends of his own age or, still more effectively, by someolder, more experienced and authoritative pederast, some Swiss precursorof Colonel Dipa?\"But that wasn't the worst.\" The Rani lowered her voice to a horrifiedstage whisper. \"One of the mothers on the committee of guardianship—one"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"of the mothers, mind you—advised himto take a course of lessons.\"\"What sort of lessons?\"\"In what they euphemistically call Love.\" She wrinkled up her nose asthough she had smelt raw sewage. \"Lessons, if you please,\" and disgustturned into indignation, \"from some Older Woman.\"63\"Heavens!\" cried the Ambassador.\"Heavens!\" Will dutifully echoed. Those older women, he could see,were competitors much more dangerous, in the Rani's eyes, than even themost precociously promiscuous of girls. A mature instructress in love wouldbe a rival mother, enjoying the monstrously unfair advantage of being freeto go the limits of incest.\"They teach ...\" The Rani hesitated. \"They teach Special Techniques.\"\"What sort of techniques?\" Will enquired. But she couldn't bring herselfto go into the repulsive particulars. And anyhow it wasn't necessary, forMurugan (bless his heart!) had refused to listen to them. Lessons inimmorality fromsomeone old enough to be his mother—the very idea of ithad made him sick. No wonder. He had been brought up to reverence theIdeal of Purity. \"Brahmacharya, if you know what that means.\"\"Quite,\" said Will.\"And this is another reason why his illness was such a blessing indisguise, such a real godsend. I don't think I could have brought himupthat way in Pala. There are too many bad influences here. Forces workingagainst Purity, against the Family, even against Mother Love.\"Will pricked up his ears. \"Did they even reformmothers?\" She nodded.\"You just can't imagine how far things have gone here. But Koot Hoomiknew what kind of dangers we would have to run in Pala. So whathappens? My Baby falls ill, and the doctors order us to Switzerland. Out ofharm's way.\"\"How was it,\" Will asked, \"that Koot Hoomi let you go off on yourCrusade? Didn't he foresee what would happen to Murugan as soon asyour back was turned?\"\"He foresaw everything,\" said the Rani. \"The temptations, theresistance, the massed assault by all the Powers of Evil and then, at thevery last moment, the rescue. For a long time,\" she64Island"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"explained, \"Murugan didn't tell me what was happening. But after threemonths the assaults of the Powers of Evil were too much for him. Hedropped hints; but I was too completely absorbed in my Master's businessto be able to take them. Finally he wrote me a letter in which it was allspelled out—in detail. I canceled my last four lectures in Brazil and flewhome as fast as the jets would carry me. A week later we were back inSwitzerland. Just my Baby and I—alone with the Master.\"She closed her eyes, and an expression of gloating ecstasy appearedupon her face. Will looked away in distaste. This self-canonized world-savior, this clutching and devouring mother—had she ever, for a singlemoment, seen herself as others saw her? Did she have any idea of whatshe had done, what she was still doing, to her poor silly little son? To thefirst question the answer was certainly no. About the second one could onlyspeculate. Perhaps she honestly didn't know what she had made of theboy. But perhaps, on the other hand, she did know. Knew and preferredwhat was happening with the Colonel to what might happen if the boy'seducation were taken in hand by a woman. The woman might supplant her;the Colonel, she knew, would not.\"Murugan told me that he intended to reformthese so-called reforms.\"\"I can only pray,\" said the Rani in a tone that reminded Will of hisgrandfather, the Archdeacon, \"that he'll be given the Strength and Wisdomto do it.\"\"And what do you think of his other projects?\" Will asked. \"Oil?Industries? An army?\"\"Economics and politics aren't exactly my strong point,\" she answeredwith a little laugh which was meant to remind him that he was talking tosomeone who had taken the Fourth Initiation. \"Ask Bahu what he thinks.\"\"I have no right to offer an opinion,\" said the Ambassador. \"I'manoutsider, the representative of a foreign power.\"65\"Not so very foreign,\" said the Rani.\"Not in your eyes, ma'am. And not, as you know very well, in mine. Butin the eyes of the Palanese government—yes. Completely foreign.\"\"But that,\" said Will, \"doesn't prevent you from having opinions. It onlyprevents you from having the locally orthodox opinions. And incidentally,\"he added, \"I'mnot here in my professional capacity. You're not beinginterviewed, Mr. Ambassador. All this is strictly off the record.\"\"Strictly off the record, then, and strictly as myself and not as an official"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"personage, I believe that our young friend is perfectly right.\"\"Which implies, of course, that you believe the policy of the Palanesegovernment to be perfectly wrong.\"\"Perfectly wrong,\" said Mr. Bahu—and the bony, emphatic mask ofSavonarola positively twinkled with his Voltairean smile—\"perfectly wrongbecause all too perfectly right.\"\"Right?\" the Rani protested. \"Right?\"\"Perfectly right,\" he explained, \"because so perfectly designed to makeevery man, woman, and child on this enchanting island as perfectly freeand happy as it's possible to be.\"\"But with a False Happiness,\" the Rani cried, \"a freedomthat's only forthe Lower Self.\"\"I bow,\" said the Ambassador, duly bowing, \"to Your High-ness'ssuperior insight. But still, high or low, true or false, happiness is happinessand freedom is most enjoyable. And there can be no doubt that the politicsinaugurated by the original Reformers and developed over the years havebeen admirably well adapted to achieving these two goals.\"\"But you feel,\" said Will, \"that these are undesirable goals?\"\"On the contrary, everybody desires them. But unfortunately they'reout of context, they've become completely irrelevant to the present situationof the world in general and Pala in particular.\"66Island\"Are they more irrelevant now than they were when the Reformers firststarted to work for happiness and freedom?\"The Ambassador nodded. \"In those days Pala was still completely offthe map. The idea of turning it into an oasis of freedom and happinessmade sense. So long as it remains out of touch with the rest of the world,an ideal society can be a viable society. Pala was completely viable, I'dsay, until about 1905. Then, in less than a single generation, the worldcompletely changed. Movies, cars, airplanes, radio. Mass production, massslaughter, mass communication and, above all, plain mass—more andmore people in bigger and bigger slums or suburbs. By 1930 any clear-sighted observer could have seen that, for three quarters of the humanrace, freedomand happiness were almost out of the question. Today, thirtyyears later, they're completely out of the question. And meanwhile theoutside world has been closing in on this little island of freedomandhappiness. Closing in steadily and inexorably, coming nearer and nearer.What was once a viable ideal is now no longer viable.\""},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"\"So Pala will have to be changed—is that your conclusion?\"Mr. Bahu nodded. \"Radically.\"\"Root and branch,\" said the Rani with a prophet's sadisticgusto.\"And for two cogent reasons,\" Mr. Bahu went on. \"First, because itsimply isn't possible for Pala to go on being different fromthe rest of theworld. And, second, because it isn't right that it should be different.\"\"Not right for people to be free and happy?\"Once again the Rani said something inspirational about falsehappiness and the wrong kind of freedom.Mr. Bahu deferentially acknowledged her interruption, then turned backto Will..,,\"Not right,\" he insisted. \"Flaunting your blessedness in the face of somuch misery—it's sheer hubris, it's a deliberate affront to the rest ofhumanity. It's even a kind of affront to God.\"67\"God,\" the Rani murmured voluptuously, \"God . . .\" Then, reopeningher eyes, \"These people in Pala,\" she added, \"they don't believe in God.They only believe in Hypnotismand Pantheismand Free Love.\" Sheemphasized the words with indignant disgust.\"So now,\" said Will, \"you're proposing to make them miserable in thehope that this will restore their faith in God. Well, that's one way ofproducing a conversion. Maybe it'll work. And maybe the end will justify themeans.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"But I do see,\" he added, \"that, goodor bad, and regardless of what the Palanese may feel about it, this thing isgoing to happen. One doesn't have to be much of a prophet to foretell thatMurugan is going to succeed. He's riding the wave of the future. And thewave of the future is undoubtedly a wave of crude petroleum. Talking ofcrudity and petroleum,\" he added, turning to the Rani, \"I understand thatyou're acquainted with my old friend, Joe Aldehyde.\" \"You know LordAldehyde?\" \"Well.\"\"So that's why my Little Voice was so insistent!\" Closing her eyesagain, she smiled to herself and slowly nodded her head. \"Now IUnderstand.\" Then, in another tone, \"How is that dear man?\" she asked.\"Still characteristically himself,\" Will assured her. \"And what a rare self!L'homme au cerf-volant—that's what I call him.\"\"The man with the kite?\" Will was puzzled. \"He does his work downhere,\" she explained; \"but he holds a string in his hand, and at the other"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"end of the string is a kite, and the kite is forever trying to go higher, higher,Higher. Even while he's at work, he feels the constant Pull fromAbove,feels the Spirit tugging insistently at the flesh. Think of it! A man of affairs, agreat Captain of Industry—and yet, for him, the only thing that ReallyMatters is the Immortality of the Soul.\"68IslandLight dawned. The woman had been talking about Joe Alde-hyde'saddiction to spiritualism. He thought of those weekly seances with Mrs.Harbottle, the automatist; with Mrs. Pym, whose control was a Kiowa Indiancalled Bawbo; with Miss Tuke and her floating trumpet out of which asqueaky whisper uttered oracular words that were taken down in shorthandby Joe's private secretary: \"Buy Australian cement; don't be alarmed by thefall in Breakfast Foods; unload forty percent of your rubber shares andinvest the money in IBMand Westinghouse ...\"\"Did he ever tell you,\" Will asked, \"about that departed stockbrokerwho always knew what the market was going to do next week?\"\"Sidhis,\" said the Rani indulgently. \"Just sidhis. What else can youexpect? After all, he's only a Beginner. And in this present life business ishis karma. He was predestined to do what he's done, what he's doing, whathe's going to do.

Not as Iwill but as God wills—and by a happy coincidence God's will and mine arealways identical. Will chuckled inwardly, but kept the straightest of faces.\"Does your Little Voice say anything about Southeast AsiaPetroleum?\" he asked.The Rani listened again, then nodded. \"Distinctly.\"\"But Colonel Dipa, I gather, doesn't say anything but 'Standard ofCalifornia.' Incidentally,\" Will went on, \"why does Pala have to worry aboutthe Colonel's taste in oil companies?\"\"My government,\" said Mr. Bahu sonorously, \"is thinking in terms of aFive-Year Plan for Interisland Economic Co-ordina tion and Co-operation.\"69\"Does Interisland Co-ordination and Co-operation mean that Standard"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"has to be granted a monopoly?\"\"Only if Standard's terms were more advantageous than those of itscompetitors.\"\"In other words,\" said the Rani, \"only if there's nobody who will pay usmore.\"\"Before you came,\" Will told her, \"I was discussing this subject withMurugan. Southeast Asia Petroleum, I said, will give Pala whateverStandard gives Rendang plus a little more.\"\"Fifteen percent more?\"\"Let's say ten.\"\"Make it twelve and a half.\"Will looked at her admiringly. For someone who had taken the FourthInitiation she was doing pretty well.\"Joe Aldehyde will scream with agony,\" he said. \"But in the end, I feelcertain, you'll get your twelve and a half.\"\"It would certainly be a most attractive proposition,\" said Mr. Bahu.\"The only trouble is that the Palanese government won't accept it.\"\"The Palanese government,\" said the Rani, \"will soon be changing itspolicy.\"\"You think so?\"\"I KNOWit,\" the Rani answered in a tone that made it quite clear thatthe information had come straight from the Master's mouth.\"When the change of policy comes, would it help,\" Will asked, \"ifColonel Dipa were to put in a good word for Southeast Asia Petroleum?\"\"Undoubtedly.\"Will turned to Mr. Bahu. \"And would you be prepared, Mr.Ambassador, to put in a good word with Colonel Dipa?\"In polysyllables, as though he were addressing a plenary ses-70Islandsion of some international organization, Mr. Bahu hedged diplomatically.On the one hand, yes; but on the other hand, no. Fromone point of view,white; but from a different angle, distinctly black.Will listened in polite silence. Behind the mask of Savonarola, behindthe aristocratic monocle, behind the ambassadorial verbiage he could seeand hear the Levantine broker in quest of his commission, the petty officialcadging for a gratuity. And for her enthusiastic sponsorship of SoutheastAsia Petroleum, how much had the royal initiate been promised?Something, he was prepared to bet, pretty substantial. Not for herself, of"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"course, no no! For the Crusade of the Spirit, needless to say, for thegreater glory of Koot Hoomi.Mr. Bahu had reached the peroration of his speech to the internationalorganization. \"It must therefore be understood,\" he was saying, \"that anypositive action on my part must remain contingent upon circumstances as,when, and if these circumstances arise. Do I make myself clear?\"\"Perfectly,\" Will assured him. \"And now,\" he went on with deliberatelyindecent frankness, \"let me explain my position in this matter. All I'minterested in is money. Two thousand pounds without having to do a hand'sturn of work. A year of freedom just for helping Joe Aldehyde to get hishands on Pala.\"\"Lord Aldehyde,\" said the Rani, \"is remarkably generous.\"\"Remarkably,\" Will agreed, \"considering how little I can do in thismatter. Needless to say, he'd be still more generous to anyone who couldbe of greater help.\"There was a long silence. In the distance a mynah bird was callingmonotonously for attention. Attention to avarice, attention to hypocrisy,attention to vulgar cynicism . . . There was a knock at the door.\"Come in,\" Will called out and, turning to Mr. Bahu, \"Let's continue thisconversation some other time,\" he said.Mr. Bahu nodded.71\"Come in,\" Will repeated.Dressed in a blue skirt and a short buttonless jacket that left her midriffbare and only sometimes covered a pair of apple-round breasts, a girl inher late teens walked briskly into the room. On her smooth brown face asmile of friendliest greeting was punctuated at either end by dimples. \"I'mNurse Appu,\" she began. \"Radhu Appu.\" Then, catching sight of Will'svisitors, she broke off. \"Oh, excuse me, I didn't know ...\"She made a perfunctory knicks to the Rani.Mr. Bahu, meanwhile, had courteously risen to his feet. \"Nurse Appu,\"he cried enthusiastically. \"My little ministering angel fromthe Shivapuramhospital. What a delightful surprise!\"For the girl, it was evident to Will, the surprise was far fromdelightful.\"How do you do, Mr. Bahu,\" she said without a smile and, quicklyturning away, started to busy herself with the straps of the canvas bag shewas carrying.\"Your Highness has probably forgotten,\" said Mr. Bahu; \"but I had to"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"have an operation last summer. For hernia,\" he specified. \"Well, this younglady used to come and wash me every morning. Punctually at eight-forty-five. And now, after having vanished for all these months, here she isagain!\"\"Synchronicity,\" said the Rani oracularly. \"It's all part of the Plan.\"\"I'm supposed to give Mr. Farnaby an injection,\" said the little nurse,looking up, still unsmiling, from her professional bag.\"Doctor's orders are doctor's orders,\" cried the Rani, overacting therole of royal personage deigning to be playfully gracious. \"To hear is toobey. But where's my chauffeur?\"\"Your chauffeur's here,\" called a familiar voice.Beautiful as a vision of Ganymede, Murugan was standing in thedoorway. A look of amusement appeared on the little nurse's face.\"Hullo, Murugan—I mean, Your Highness.\" She bobbed72Islandanother curtsy, which he was free to take as a mark of respect or of ironicmockery.\"Oh, hullo, Radha,\" said the boy in a tone that was meant to bedistantly casual. He walked past her to where his mother was sitting. \"Thecar,\" he said, \"is at the door. Or rather the so-called car.\" With a sarcasticlaugh, \"It's a Baby Austin, 1954 vintage,\" he explained to Will. \"The bestthat this highly civilized country can provide for its royal family. Rendanggives its ambassador a Bentley,\" he added bitterly.\"Which will be calling for me at this address in about ten minutes,\" saidMr. Bahu, looking at his watch. \"So may I be permitted to take leave of youhere, Your Highness?\"The Rani extended her hand. With all the piety of a good Catholickissing a cardinal's ring, he bent over it; then, straightening himself up, heturned to Will.\"I'massuming—perhaps unjustifiably—that Mr. Farnaby can put upwith me for a little longer. May I stay?\"Will assured the Ambassador that he would be delighted.\"And I hope,\" said Mr. Bahu to the little nurse, \"that there will be noobjections on medical grounds?\"\"Not on medical grounds,\" said the girl in a tone that implied theexistence of the most cogent nonmedical objections.Assisted by Murugan, the Rani hoisted herself out of her chair. uAurevoir, mon cher Farnaby,\" she said as she gave him her jeweled hand.

The Rani makes the samekind of impression. Monumental. She's what the Germans call eine grosseSeek.\" The twinkle had faded, the face was unequivocally Savonarola's,the words, it was obvious, were for publication.The little nurse suddenly started to laugh.\"What's so funny?\" Will asked.\"I suddenly saw the Great Pyramid all dressed up in white muslin,\" shegasped. \"Dr. Robert calls it the mystic's uniform.\"\"Witty, very witty!\" said Mr. Bahu. \"And yet,\" he added diplomatically, \"Idon't know why mystics shouldn't wear uniforms, if they feel like it.\"The little nurse drew a deep breath, wiped the tears of merriment fromher eyes, and began to make her preparations for giving the patient hisinjection.74Island\"I know exactly what you're thinking,\" she said to Will. \"You're thinkingI'm much too young to do a good job.\"\"I certainly think you're very young.\"\"You people go to a university at eighteen and stay there for fouryears.

Your neurosisrate is about one in five or even four. Ours is about one in twenty.

Three of themwere psychiatrists, and one of thepsychiatrists smoked cigars without stopping and had a German accent. Hewas the one that was chosen to give us a lecture. What a lecture!\" The littlenurse held her head between her hands. \"I never heard anything like it.\"\"What was it about?\"\"About the way they treat people with neurotic symptoms. We justcouldn't believe our ears. They never attack on all the fronts; they onlyattack on about half of one front. So far as80Islandthey're concerned, the physical fronts don't exist. Except for a mouth andan anus, their patient doesn't have a body. He isn't an organism, he wasn'tborn with a constitution or a temperament. All he has is the two ends of adigestive tube, a family and a psyche. But what sort of psyche? Obviouslynot the whole mind, not the mind as it really is. How could it be that whenthey take no account of a person's anatomy, or biochemistry or physiology?Mind abstracted frombody—that's the only front they attack on. And noteven on the whole of that front. The man with the cigar kept talking aboutthe unconscious. But the only unconscious they ever pay attention to is thenegative unconscious, the garbage that people have tried to get rid of byburying it in the basement. Not a single word about the positiveunconscious. No attempt to help the patient to open himself up to the lifeforce or the Buddha Nature. And no attempt even to teach himto be a littlemore conscious in his everyday life. You know: 'Here and now, boys.''Attention.' \" She gave an imitation of the mynah birds. \"These people justleave the unfortunate neurotic to wallow in his old bad habits of never beingall there in present time.

And then look attheir idea of what's normal. Believe it or not, a normal human being is onewho can have an orgasmand is adjusted to his society.\" Once again thelittle nurse held her head between her hands. \"It's unimaginable!

Then, switching off theAmbassador, \"Don't forget to write that letter,\" he said. \"It's very important.\"He smiled con-spiratorially and, passing his thumb back and forth acrossthe first two fingers of his right hand, he counted out invisible money.\"Thank goodness,\" said the little nurse when he had gone.\"What was his offense?\" Will enquired. \"The usual thing?\"\"Offering money to someone you want to go to bed with—but shedoesn't like you.

He finished the last of his cold boiled fishand vegetables. Nurse Appu handed him a plate of fruit salad.\"You've never seen Murugan in white satin pajamas,\" she said.\"Have I missed something?\"\"You've no idea how beautiful he looks in white satin pajamas.

Result: we're Mahayanists, and ourBuddhismis shot through and through with Tantra. Do you know whatTantra is?\"Will had to admit that he had only the haziest notion.\"And to tell you the truth,\" said Ranga, with a laugh that broke"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"irrepressibly through the crust of his pedantry, \"I don't really know muchmore than you do. Tantra's an enormous sub-88Islandject and most of it, I guess, is just silliness and superstition—not worthbothering about. But there's a hard core of sense. If you're a Tantrik, youdon't renounce the world or deny its value; you don't try to escape into aNirvana apart fromlife, as the monks of the Southern School do. No, youaccept the world, and you make use of it; you make use of everything youdo, of everything that happens to you, of all the things you see and hearand taste and touch, as so many means to your liberation fromthe prisonof yourself.\"\"Good talk,\" said Will in a tone of polite skepticism.\"And something more besides,\" Ranga insisted. \"That's the difference,\"he added—and youthful pedantry modulated into the eagerness of youthfulproselytism—\"that's the difference between your philosophy and ours.Western philosophers, even the best of them—they're nothing more thangood talkers. Eastern philosophers are often rather bad talkers, but thatdoesn't matter. Talk isn't the point. Their philosophy is pragmatic andoperational. Like the philosophy of modern physics-except that theoperations in question are psychological and the results transcendental.Your metaphysicians make statements about the nature of man and theuniverse; but they don't offer the reader any way of testing the truth ofthose statements. When we make statements, we follow themup with a listof operations that can be used for testing the validity of what we've beensaying. For example, tat tvamasi, 'thou are That'—the heart of all ourphilosophy. Tat tvam asi,\" he repeated. \"It looks like a proposition inmetaphysics; but what it actually refers to is a psychological experience,and the operations by means of which the experience can be lived throughare described by our philosophers, so that anyone who's willing to performthe necessary operations can test the validity of tat tvam asi for himself.The operations arc-called yoga, or dhyana, or Zen—or, in certain specialcircumstances, maithuna.\"89\"Which brings us back to my original question. What is ntaithuna!\"\"Maybe you'd better ask Radha.\"Will turned to the little nurse. \"What is it?\""},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"u Maithuna,\" she answered gravely, \"is the yoga of love.\"\"Sacred or profane?\"\"There's no difference.\"\"That's the whole point,\" Ranga put in. \"When you do maithuna,profane love is sacred love.\"\"Buddhatvanyoshidyonisansritan,\" the girl quoted.\"None of your Sanskirt!

Eight annas for ablack yoni; twelve for the still more sacred image of the yoni-lingam.\"Literally in the yoniV he asked. \"Or metaphorically?\"\"What a ridiculous question!\" said the little nurse, and she laughed herclear unaffected laugh of pure amusement. \"Do you think we make lovemetaphorically? Buddhatvan yoshidyonisan-sritan\" she repeated. \"Itcouldn't be more completely and absolutely literal.\"\"Did you ever hear of the Oneida Community?\" Ranga now asked.Will nodded. He had known an American historian who specialized innineteenth-century communities. \"But why do you know about it?\" heasked.\"Because it's mentioned in all our textbooks of applied philosophy.Basically, maithuna is the same as what the Oneida peo-90Islandpie called Male Continence. And that was the same as what RomanCatholics mean by coitus reservatus.\"\"Reservatus,\" the little nurse repeated. \"It always makes me want tolaugh. 'Such a reserved young man'!\" The dimples reappeared and therewas a flash of white teeth.\"Don't be silly,\" said Ranga severely. \"This is serious.\"She expressed her contrition. \"But reservatus was really toofunny.\"\"In a word,\" Will concluded, \"it's just birth control withoutcontraceptives.\"\"But that's only the beginning of the story,\" said Ranga. \"Maithuna is"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"also something else. Something even more important.\" The undergraduatepedant had reasserted himself. \"Remember,\" he went on earnestly,\"remember the point that Freud was always harping on.\"\"Which point? There were so many.\"\"The point about the sexuality of children. What we're born with, whatwe experience all through infancy and childhood, is a sexuality that isn'tconcentrated on the genitals; it's a sexuality diffused throughout the wholeorganism. That's the paradise we inherit. But the paradise gets lost as thechild grows up. Maithuna is the organized attempt to regain that paradise.\"He turned to Radha. \"You've got a good memory,\" he said. \"What's thatphrase of Spinoza's that they quote in the applied philosophy book?\"\" 'Make the body capable of doing many things,' \" she recited. \" 'Thiswill help you to perfect the mind and so to come to the intellectual love ofGod.' \"\"Hence all the yogas,\" said Ranga. \"Including maithuna.\"\"And it's a real yoga,\" the girl insisted. \"As good as raja yoga, or karmayoga, or bhakti yoga. In fact, a great deal better, so far as most people areconcerned. Maithuna really gets them there.\"\"What's 'there'?\" Will asked.\" 'There' is where you know.\"91\"Know what?\"\"Know who in fact you are—and believe it or not,\" she added, \"tat tvamasi—thou art That, and so amI: That is me.\" The dimples came to life, theteeth flashed. \"And That's also him.\" She pointed at Ranga. \"Incredible,isn't it?\" She stuck out her tongue at him. \"And yet it's a fact.\"Ranga smiled, reached out and with an extended forefinger touchedthe tip of her nose. \"And not merely a fact,\" he said. \"A revealed truth.\" Hegave the nose a little tap. \"A revealed truth,\" he repeated. \"So mind yourP's and Q's, young woman.\"\"What I'm wondering,\" said Will, \"is why we aren't all enlightened—Imean, if it's just a question of making love with a rather special kind oftechnique. What's the answer to that?\"\"I'll tell you,\" Ranga began.But the girl cut himshort. \"Listen,\" she said, \"listen!\"Will listened.

But a moment ago you were saying it was something else.What about that young man who's so reserved?\"\"That's just to make it easier to pay attention.\"\"And it does make it easier,\" Ranga confirmed. \"And that's the wholepoint of maithuna. It's not the special technique that turns love-making intoyoga; it's the kind of awareness that the technique makes possible.Awareness of one's sensations and awareness of the not-sensation inevery sensation.\"\"What's a not-sensation?\"\"It's the raw material for sensation that my not-self provides me with.\"\"And you can pay attention to your not-self?\"\"Ofcourse.\"Will turned to the little nurse. \"You too?\"92Island\"To myself,\" she answered, \"and at the same time to my not-self.

And all the while one'spaying attention to all the things that, if one were sentimental, or worse, ifone were spiritual like the poor old Rani, one would find so unromantic andgross and sordid even. But they aren't sordid, because one's also payingattention to the fact that, when one's fully aware of them, those things arejust as beautiful as all the rest, just as wonderful.\"\"Maithuna is dhyana,\" Ranga concluded.

Free, gratis, and fornothing—except of course that they have to be paid for out of taxes.\"\"The postman,\" Radha added, \"delivers a thirty-night supply at thebeginning of each month.\"\"And the babies don't arrive?\"\"Only those we want. Nobody has more than three, and most peoplestop at two.\"\"With the result,\" said Ranga, reverting, with the statistics, to hispedantic manner, \"that our population is increasing at less than a third ofone percent per annum. Whereas Rendang's increase is as big as"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Ceylon's—almost three percent. And China's is two percent, and India'sabout one point seven.\"\"I was in China only a month ago,\" said Will. \"Terrifying!94IslandAnd last year I spent four weeks in India. And before India in CentralAmerica, which is outbreeding even Rendang and Ceylon. Has either ofyou been in Rendang-Lobo?\"Ranga nodded affirmatively.\"Three days in Rendang,\" he explained. \"If you get into the UpperSixth, it's part of the advanced sociology course. They let you see foryourself what the Outside is like.\"\"And what did you think of the Outside?\" Will enquired.Ranga answered with another question. \"When you were in Rendang-Lobo, did they show you the slums?\"\"On the contrary, they did their best to prevent me fromseeing theslums. But I gave them the slip.\"Gave them the slip, he was vividly remembering, on his way back tothe hotel fromthat grisly cocktail party at the Rendang Foreign Office.Everybody who was anybody was there. All the local dignitaries and theirwives—uniforms and medals, Dior and emeralds. All the importantforeigners—diplomats galore, British and American oilmen, six members ofthe Japanese trade mission, a lady pharmacologist fromLeningrad, twoPolish engineers, a German tourist who just happened to be a cousin ofKrupp von Bohlen, an enigmatic Armenian representing a very importantfinancial consortiumin Tangier, and, beaming with triumph, the fourteenCzech technicians who had come with last month's shipment of tanks andcannon and machine guns from Skoda. \"And these are the people,\" he hadsaid to himself as he walked down the marble steps of the Foreign Officeinto Liberty Square, \"these are the people who rule the world. Twenty-ninehundred millions of us at the mercy of a few scores of politicians, a fewthousands of tycoons and generals and moneylenders. Ye are the cyanideof the earth—and the cyanide will never, never lose its savor.\"After the glare of the cocktail party, after the laughter and the luscioussmells of canapes and Chanel-sprayed women, those alleys behind thebrand-new Palace of Justice had seemed doubly95"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"dark and noisome. Those poor wretches camping out under the palm treesof Independence Avenue more totally abandoned by God and man thaneven the homeless, hopeless thousands he had seen sleeping like corpsesin the streets of Calcutta. And now he thought of that little boy, that tinypotbellied skeleton, whomhe had picked up, bruised and shaken by a fallfromthe back of the little girl, scarcely larger than himself, who wascarrying him—had picked up and, led by the other child, had carried hack,carried down, to the windowless cellar that, for nine of them(he hadcounted the dark ringwormy heads), was home.\"Keeping babies alive,\" he said, \"healing the sick, preventing thesewage fromgetting into the water supply—one starts with doing thingsthat are obviously and intrinsically good. And how does one end? One endsby increasing the sumof human misery and jeopardizing civilization. It's thekind of cosmic practical joke that God seems really to enjoy.\"He gave the young people one of his flayed, ferocious grins. \"God hasnothing to do with it,\" Ranga retorted, \"and the joke isn't cosmic, it's strictlyman-made. These things aren't like gravity or the second law ofthermodynamics; they don't have to happen. They happen only if peopleare stupid enough to allow themto happen. Here in Pala we haven'tallowed them to happen, so the joke hasn't been played on us. We've hadgood sanitation for the best part of a century—and still we're notovercrowded, we're not miserable, we're not under a dictatorship. And thereason is very simple: we chose to behave in a sensible and realistic way.\"\"How on earth were you able to choose?\" Will asked. \"The right peoplewere intelligent at the right moment,\" said Ranga. \"But it must beadmitted—they were also very lucky. In fact Pala as a whole has beenextraordinarily lucky. It's had the luck, first of all, never to have beenanyone's colony. Rendang has a magnificent harbor. That brought themanArab invasion in the Middle Ages. We have no harbor, so the Arabs left usalone96Islandand we're still Buddhists or Shivaites—that is, when we're not Tantrikagnostics.\"\"Is that what you are?\" Will enquired. \"A Tantrik agnostic?\"\"With Mahayana trimmings,\" Ranga qualified. \"Well, to return toRendang. After the Arabs it got the Portuguese. We didn't. No harbor, noPortuguese. Therefore no Catholic minority, no blasphemous nonsenseabout its being God's will that people should breed themselves into"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"subhuman misery, no organized resistance to birth control. And that isn'tour only blessing: After a hundred and twenty years of the Portuguese,Ceylon and Rendang got the Dutch. And after the Dutch came the English.We escaped both those infestations. No Dutch, no English, and thereforeno planters, no coolie labor, no cash crops for export, no systematicexhaustion of our soil. Also no whisky, no Calvinism, no syphilis, no foreignadministrators. We were left to go our own way and take responsibility forour own affairs.\"\"You certainly were lucky.\"\"And on top of that amazing good luck,\" Ranga went on, \"there wasthe amazing good management of Murugan the Reformer and AndrewMacPhail. Has Dr. Robert talked to you about his great-grandfather?\"\"Just a few words, that's all.\"\"Did he tell you about the founding of the Experimental Station?\"Will shook his head.\"The Experimental Station,\" said Ranga, \"had a lot to do with ourpopulation policy. It all began with a famine. Before he came to Pala, Dr.Andrew spent a few years in Madras. The second year he was there, themonsoon failed. The crops were burnt up, the tanks and even the wellswent dry. Except for the English and the rich, there was no food. Peopledied like flies. There's a famous passage in Dr. Andrew's memoirs aboutthe famine. A description and then a comment. He'd had to listen to97a lot of sermons when he was a boy, and there was one he keptremembering now, as he worked among the starving Indians. 'Man cannotlive by bread alone'—that was the text, and the preacher had been soeloquent that several people were converted. 'Man cannot live by breadalone.' But without bread, he now saw, there is no mind, no spirit, no innerlight, no Father in Heaven. There is only hunger, there is only despair andthen apathy and finally death.\"\"Another of the cosmic jokes,\" said Will. \"And this one was formulatedby Jesus himself. 'To those who have shall be given, and from those whohave not shall be taken away even that which they have'—the barepossibility of being human. It's the crudest of all God's jokes, and also thecommonest. I've seen it being played on millions of men and women,millions of small children—all over the world.\"\"So you can understand why that famine made such an indelibleimpression on Dr. Andrew's mind. He was resolved, and so was his friend"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"the Raja, that in Pala, at least, there should always be bread. Hence theirdecision to set up the Experimental Station. Rothamsted-in-the-Tropics wasa great success. In a few years we had new strains of rice and maize andmillet and breadfruit. We had better breeds of cattle and chickens. Betterways of cultivating and composting; and in the fifties we built the firstsuperphosphate factory east of Berlin. Thanks to all these things peoplewere eating better, living longer, losing fewer children. Ten years after thefounding of Rothamsted-in-the-Tropics the Raja took a census. Thepopulation had been stable, more or less, for a century. Now it had startedto rise. In fifty or sixty years, Dr. Andrew foresaw, Pala would betransformed into the kind of festering slumthat Rendang is today. Whatwas to be clone? Dr. Andrew had read his Malthus. 'Food productionincreases arithmetically; population increases geometrically. Man has onlytwo choices: he can either leave the matter to Nature, who will solve thepopulation problem in the old familiar way, by98Islandfamine, pestilence and war: or else (Malthus being a clergyman) he cankeep down his numbers by moral restraint.' \"\"Mor-ral r-restr-raint,\" the little nurse repeated, rolling her r's in theIndonesian parody of a Scottish divine. \"Mor-ral r-restr-raint! Incidentally,\"she added, \"Dr. Andrew had just married the Raja's sixteen-year-old niece.\"\"And that,\" said Ranga, \"was yet another reason for revising Malthus.Famine on this side, restraint on that. Surely there must be some better,happier, humaner way between the Malthusian horns. And of course therewas such a way even then, even before the age of rubber and spermicides.There were sponges, there was soap, there were condoms made of everyknown waterproof material from oiled silk to the blind gut of sheep. Thewhole armory of Paleo-Birth Control.\"\"And how did the Raja and his subjects react to Paleo-Birth Control?With horror?\"\"Not at all. They were good Buddhists, and every good Bud dhistknows that begetting is merely postponed assassination. Do your best toget off the Wheel of Birth and Death, and for heaven's sake don't go aboutputting superfluous victims onto the Wheel. For a good Buddhist, birthcontrol makes metaphys ical sense. And for a village community of ricegrowers, it makes social and economic sense. There must be enoughyoung people to work the fields and support the aged and the little ones.But not too many of them; for then neither the old nor the workers nor their"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"children will have enough to eat. In the old days, couples had to have sixchildren in order to raise two or three. Then came clean water and theExperimental Station. Out of six chil dren five now survived. The oldpatterns of breeding had ceased to make sense. The only objection toPaleo-Birth Control was its crudity. But fortunately there was a moreaesthetic alternative. The Raja was a Tantrik initiate and had learned theyoga of love. Dr. Andrew was told about maithunn and, being a true man of99science, agreed to try it. He and his young wife were given the necessaryinstruction.\"\"With what results?\"\"Enthusiastic approval.\"\"That's the way everybody feels about it,\" said Radha.\"Now, now, none of your sweeping generalizations! Some feel thatway, others don't. Dr. Andrew was one of the enthusiasts. The wholematter was lengthily discussed. In the end they decided that contraceptivesshould be like education—free, tax-supported and, though not compulsory,as nearly as possible universal. For those who felt the need for somethingmore refined, there would be instruction in the yoga of love.\"\"Do you mean to tell me that they got away with it?\"\"It wasn't really so difficult. Maithuna was orthodox. People weren'tbeing asked to do anything against their religion. On the contrary, theywere being given a flattering opportunity to join the elect by learningsomething esoteric.\"\"And don't forget the most important point of all,\" the little nursechimed in. \"For women—all women, and I don't care what you say aboutsweeping generalizations—the yoga of love means perfection, meansbeing transformed and taken out of themselves and completed.\" There wasa brief silence. \"And now,\" she resumed in another, brisker tone, \"it's hightime we left you to your siesta.\"\"Before you go,\" said Will, \"I'd like to write a letter. Just a brief note tomy boss to say that I'malive and in no immediate danger of being eaten bythe natives.\"Radha went foraging in Dr. Robert's study and came back with paper,pencil and an envelope.\" Veni, vidi,\" Will scrawled. \"I was wrecked, I met the Rani and hercollaborator fromRendang, who implies that he can deliver the goods inreturn for baksheesh to the tune (he was specific) of twenty thousand"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"pounds. Shall I negotiate on this100Islandbasis? If you cable Proposed article OK, I shall go ahead. If No hurry forarticle I shall let the matter drop. Tell my mother I am safe and shall soonbe writing.\"\"There,\" he said as he handed the envelope, sealed and addressed, toRanga. \"May I ask you to buy me a stamp and get this off in time to catchtomorrow's plane?\"\"Without fail,\" the boy promised.Watching themgo, Will felt a twinge of conscience. What charmingyoung people! And here he was, plotting with Bahu and the forces ofhistory to subvert their world. He comforted himself with the thought that, ifhe didn't do it, somebody else would. And even if Joe Aldehyde did get hisconcession, they could still go on making love in the style to which theywere accustomed. Or couldn't they?From the door the little nurse turned back for a final word. \"No readingnow,\" she wagged her finger at him. \"Go to sleep.\"\"I never sleep during the day,\" Will assured her, with a certain perversesatisfaction.101He could never go to sleep during the day; but when he looked next athis watch, the time was twenty-five past four, and he was feelingwonderfully refreshed. He picked up Notes on What's What, and resumedhis interrupted reading:Give us this day our daily Faith, but deliver us, dear God, from Belief.This was as far as he had got this morning; and now here was a newsection, the fifth:Me as I think I amand me as I amin fact—sorrow, in other words, andthe ending of sorrow. One third, more or less, of all the sorrow that theperson I think I am must endure is unavoidable. It is the sorrow inherent inthe human condition, the price we must pay for being sentient and self-conscious organisms, aspirants to liberation, but subject to the laws ofnature and under orders to keep on marching, through irreversible time,through a world wholly indifferent to our well-being, toward decrepitude andthe certainty of"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"102Islanddeath. The remaining two thirds of all sorrow is homemade and, so far asthe universe is concerned, unnecessary.Will turned the page. A sheet of notepaper fluttered onto the bed. Hepicked it up and glanced at it. Twenty lines of small clear writing and at thebottom of the page the initials S. M. Not a letter evidently; a poemandtherefore public property. He read:Somewhere between brute silence and last Sunday'sThirteen hundred thousand sermons;Somewhere betweenCalvin on Christ (God help us!) and the lizards;Somewhere between seeing and speaking, somewhereBetween our soiled and greasy currency of wordsAnd the first star, the great moths flutteringAbout the ghosts of flowers,Lies the clear place where I, no longer I,Nevertheless rememberLove's nightlong wisdomof the other shore;And, listening to the wind, remember tooThat other night, that first of widowhood,Sleepless, with death beside me in the dark.Mine, mine, all mine, mine inescapably!But I, no longer I,In this clear place between my thought and silenceSee all I had and lost, anguish and joys,Glowing like gentians in the Alpine grass,Blue, unpossessed and open.\"Like gentians,\" Will repeated to himself, and thought of that summerholiday in Switzerland when he was twelve; thought of the meadow, highabove Grindelwald, with its unfamiliar flowers, its wonderful un-Englishbutterflies; thought of the dark-blue sky and the sunshine and the hugeshining moun-103tains on the other side of the valley. And all his father had found to say wasthat it looked like an advertisement for Nestle's milk chocolate. \"Not evenreal chocolate,\" he had insisted with a grimace of disgust. \"Milk chocolate.\"After which there had been an ironic comment on the water color his"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"mother was painting—so badly (poor thing!) but with such loving andconscientious care. \"The milk chocolate advertisement that Nestlerejected.\" And now it was his turn. \"Instead of just mooning about with yourmouth open, like the village idiot, why not do something intelligent for achange? Put in some work on your German grammar, for example.\" Anddiving into the rucksack, he had pulled out, fromamong the hard-boiledeggs and the sandwiches, the abhorred little brown book. What adetestable mail! And yet, if Susila was right, one ought to be able to seehimnow, after all these years, glowing like a gentian—Will glanced again atthe last line of the poem—\"blue, unpossessed and open.\"\"Well ...\" said a familiar voice.He turned toward the door. \"Talk of the devil,\" he said. \"Or rather readwhat the devil has written.\" He held up the sheet of notepaper for herinspection.Susila glanced at it. \"Oh that,'' she said. \"If only good intentions wereenough to make good poetry!\" She sighed and shook her head.\"I was trying to think of my father as a gentian,\" he went on. \"But all Iget is the persistent image of the most enormous turd.\"\"Even turds,\" she assured him, \"can be seen as gentians.\"\"But only, I take it, in the place you were writing about—the clear placebetween thought and silence?\"Susila nodded.\"How do you get there?\"\"You don't get there. There comes to you. Or rather there is reallyhere.\"\"You're just like little Radha,\" he complained. \"Parroting what the OldRaja says at the beginning of this book.\"104Island\"If we repeat it,\" she said, \"it's because it happens to be true. If wedidn't repeat it, we'd be ignoring the facts.\"\"Whose facts?\" he asked. \"Certainly not mine.\"\"Not at the moment,\" she agreed. \"But if you were to do the kind ofthings that the Old Raja recommends, they might be yours.\"\"Did you have parent trouble?\" he asked after a little silence. \"Or couldyou aways see turds as gentians?\"\"Not at that age,\" she answered. \"Children have to be Manicheandualists. It's the price we must all pay for learning the rudiments of beinghuman. Seeing turds as gentians, or rather seeing both gentians and turds"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"as Gentians with a capital G—that's a postgraduate accomplishment.\"\"So what did you do about your parents? Just grin and bear theunbearable? Or did your father and mother happen to be bearable?\"\"Bearable separately,\" she answered. \"Especially my father. But quiteunbearable together—unbearable because they couldn't bear one another.A bustling, cheerful, outgoing woman married to a man so fastidiouslyintroverted that she got on his nerves all the time—even, I suspect, in bed.She never stopped communicating, and he never started. With the resultthat he thought she was shallow and insincere, she thought he washeartless, contemptuous and without normal human feelings.\"\"I'd have expected that you people would know better than to walk intothat kind of trap.\"\"We do know better,\" she assured him. \"Boys and girls are specificallytaught what to expect of people whose temperament and physique are verydifferent from their own. Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that thelessons don't seem to have much effect. Not to mention the fact that insome cases the psychological distance between the people involved isreally too great to be bridged. Anyhow, the fact remains that my father andmother never managed to make a go of it. They'd fallen in love with one105another—goodness knows why. But when they came to close quarters, shefound herself being constantly hurt by his inaccessibility, while heruninhibited good-fellowship made himfairly cringe with embarrassment anddistaste. My sympathies were always with my father. Physically andtemperamentally I'mvery close to him, not in the least like my mother. Iremember, even as a tiny child, how I used to shrink away fromherexuberance. She was like a permanent invasion of one's privacy. She stillis.\"\"Do you have to see a lot of her?\"\"Very little. She has her own job and her own friends. In our part of theworld 'Mother' is strictly the name of a function. When the function hasbeen duly fulfilled, the title lapses; the ex-child and the woman who used tobe called 'Mother' establish a new kind of relationship. If they get on welltogether, they continue to see a lot of one another. If they don't, they driftapart. Nobody expects themto cling, and clinging isn't equated withloving—isn't regarded as anything particularly creditable.\"\"So all's well now. But what about then? What happened when youwere a child, growing up between two people who couldn't bridge the gulf"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"that separated them? I know what that means—the fairy-story ending inreverse, 'And so they lived unhappily ever after.' \"\"And I've no doubt,\" said Susila, \"that if we hadn't been born in Pala,we would have lived unhappily ever after. As it was, we got on, all thingsconsidered, remarkably well.\"\"How did you manage to do that?\"\"We didn't; it was all managed for us. Have you read what the Old Rajasays about getting rid of the two thirds of sorrow that's homemade andgratuitous?\"Will nodded. \"I was just reading it when you came in.\"\"Well, in the bad old days,\" she went on, \"Palanese families could bejust as victimizing, tyrant-producing and liar-creating as yours can be today.In fact they were so awful that Dr. Andrew and the Raja of the Reformdecided that something had to be106Islanddone about it. Buddhist ethics and primitive village communismwereskillfully made to serve the purposes of reason, and in a single generationthe whole family systemwas radically changed.\" She hesitated for amoment. \"Let me explain,\" she went on, \"in terms of my own particularcase—the case of an only child of two people who couldn't understand oneanother and were always at cross-purposes or actually quarreling. In theold days, a little girl brought up in those surroundings would have emergedas either a wreck, a rebel, or a resigned hypocritical conformist. Under thenew dispensation I didn't have to undergo unnecessary suffer ing, I wasn'twrecked or forced into rebellion or resignation. Why? Because from themoment I could toddle, I was free to escape.\"\"To escape?\" he repeated. \"To escape?\" It seemed too good to betrue.\"Escape,\" she explained, \"is built into the new system. Whenever theparental Home Sweet Home becomes too unbearable, the child is allowed,is actively encouraged—and the whole weight of public opinion is behindthe encouragement—to migrate to one of its other homes.\"\"How many homes does a Palanese child have?\"\"About twenty on the average.\"\"Twenty? My God!\"\"We all belong,\" Susila explained, \"to an MAC—a Mutual AdoptionClub. Every MAC consists of anything fromfifteen to twenty-five assortedcouples. Newly elected brides and bridegrooms, old-timers with growing"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"children, grandparents and great-grandparents—everybody in the clubadopts everyone else. Besides our own blood relations, we all have ourquota of deputy mothers, deputy fathers, deputy aunts and uncles, deputybrothers and sisters, deputy babies and toddlers and teen-agers.\"Will shook his head. \"Making twenty families grow where only onegrew before.\"\"But what grew before was your kind of family. The twenty107are all our kind.\" As though reading instructions froma cookery book, \"Takeone sexually inept wage slave,\" she went on, \"one dissatisfied female, twoor (if preferred) three small television addicts; marinate in a mixture ofFreudismand dilute Christianity; then bottle up tightly in a four-room flatand stew for fifteen years in their own juice. Our recipe is rather different:Take twenty sexually satisfied couples and their offspring; add science,intuition and humor in equal quantities; steep in Tantrik Buddhismandsimmer indefinitely in an open pan in the open air over a brisk flame ofaffection.\"\"And what comes out of your open pan?\" he asked. \"An entirelydifferent kind of family. Not exclusive, like your families, and notpredestined, not compulsory. An inclusive, unpredestined and voluntaryfamily. Twenty pairs of fathers and mothers, eight or nine ex-fathers andex-mothers, and forty or fifty assorted children of all ages.\"\"Do people stay in the same adoption club all their lives?\" \"Of coursenot. Grown-up children don't adopt their own parents or their own brothersand sisters. They go out and adopt another set of elders, a different groupof peers and juniors. And the members of the new club adopt themand, indue course, their children. Hybridization of microcultures—that's what oursociologists call the process. It's as beneficial, on its own level, as thehybridization of different strains of maize or chickens. Healthierrelationships in more responsible groups, wider sympathies and deeperunderstandings. And the sympathies and understandings arc for everyonein the MAC from babies to centenarians.\" \"Centenarians? What's yourexpectation of life?\" \"A year or two more than yours,\" she answered. \"Tenpercent of us are over sixty-five. The old get pensions, if they can't earn.But obviously pensions aren't enough. They need some-thing useful andchallenging to do; they need people they can care for and be loved by inreturn. The MAC's fulfill those needs.\""},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"108Island\"It all sounds,\" said Will, \"suspiciously like the propaganda for one ofthe new Chinese communes.\"\"Nothing,\" she assured him, \"could be less like a commune than anMAC. An MAC isn't run by the government, it's run by its members. Andwe're not militaristic. We're not interested in turning out good partymembers; we're only interested in turn ing out good human beings. Wedon't inculcate dogmas. And finally we don't take the children away fromtheir parents; on the contrary, we give the children additional parents andthe parents additional children. That means that even in the nursery weenjoy a certain degree of freedom; and our freedomincreases as we growolder and can deal with a wider range of experience and take on greaterresponsibilities. Whereas in China there's no freedom at all. The childrenare handed over to official baby tamers, whose business it is to turn theminto obedient servants of the State. Things are a great deal better in yourpart of the world—better, but still quite bad enough. You escape the stateappointed baby-tamers; but your society condemns you to pass yourchildhood in an exclusive family, with only a single set of siblings andparents. They're foisted on you by hereditary pre destination. You can't getrid of them, can't take a holiday fromthem, can't go to anyone else for achange of moral or psycho logical air. It's freedom, if you like—but freedomin a telephone booth.\"\"Locked in,\" Will elaborated, \"(and I'mthinking now ol myself) with asneering bully, a Christian martyr, and a little girl who'd been frightened bythe bully and blackmailed by the mar tyr's appeal to her better feelings intoa state of quivering imbe cility. That was the home fromwhich, until I wasfourteen and my aunt Mary came to live next door, I never escaped.\"\"And your unfortunate parents never escaped fromyou.'\"\"That's not quite true. My father used to escape into brandy and mymother into High Anglicanism. I had to serve out my109sentence without the slightest mitigation. Fourteen years of familyservitude. How I envy you! Free as a bird!\"\"Not so lyrical! Free, let's say, as a developing human being, lice as afuture woman—but no freer. Mutual Adoption guarantees children againstinjustice and the worst consequences of parental ineptitude. It doesn'tguarantee themagainst discipline, or against having to accept"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"responsibilities. On the contrary, it increases the number of theirresponsibilities; it exposes themto a wide variety of disciplines. In yourpredestined and exclusive families, children, as you say, serve a longprison term under a single set of parental jailers. These parental jailersmay, of course, be good, wise and intelligent. In that case the littleprisoners will emerge more or less unscathed. But in point of fact most ofyour parental jailers are not conspicuously good, wise or intelligent. They'reapt to be well-meaning but stupid, or not well-meaning and frivolous, orelse neurotic, or occasionally downright malevolent, or frankly insane. SoGod help the young convicts committed by law and customand religion totheir tender mercies! But now consider what happens in a large, inclusive,voluntary family. No telephone booths, no predestined jailers. Here thechildren grow up in a world that's a working model of society at large, asmall-scale but accurate version of the environment in which they're goingto have to live when they're grown up. 'Holy,' 'healthy,' 'whole'—they allcome from the same root and carry different overtones of the samemeaning. Etymologically, and in fact, our kind of family, the inclusive andvoluntary kind, is the genuine holy family. Yours is the unholy family.\"\"Amen,\" said Will, and thought again of his own childhood, thought tooof poor little Murugan in the clutches of the Rani. \"What happens,\" heasked after a pause, \"when the children migrate to one of their otherhomes? How long do they stay there?\"\"It all depends. When my children get fed up with me, they110Islandseldomstay away for more than a day or two. That's because,fundamentally, they're very happy at home. I wasn't, and so when I walkedout, I'd sometimes stay away for a whole month.\"\"And did your deputy parents back you up against your real motherand father?\"\"It's not a question of doing anything against anybody. All that's beingbacked up is intelligence and good feeling, and all that's being opposed isunhappiness and its avoidable causes. If a child feels unhappy in his firsthome, we do our best for him in fifteen or twenty second homes.Meanwhile the father and mother get some tactful therapy from the othermembers of their Mutual Adoption Club. In a few weeks the parents are fitto be with their children again, and the children are fit to be with theirparents. But you mustn't think,\" she added, \"that it's only when they're introuble that children resort to their deputy parents and grandparents. They"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"do it all the time, whenever they feel the need for a change or some kind ofnew experience. And it isn't just a social whirl. Wherever they go, as deputychildren, they have their responsibilities as well as their rights—brushingthe dog, for example, cleaning out the birdcages, minding the baby whilethe mother's doing something else. Duties as well as privileges—but not inone of your airless little telephone booths. Duties and privileges in a big,open, unpredestined, inclusive family, where all the seven ages of man anda dozen different skills and talents are represented, and in which childrenhave experience of all the important and significant things that humanbeings do and suffer—working, playing, loving, getting old, being sick,dying ...\" She was silent, thinking of Dugald and Dugald's mother; then,deliberately changing her tone, \"But what about you)\" she went on. \"I'vebeen so busy talking about families that I haven't even asked you howyou're feeling. You certainly look a lot better than when I saw you last.\"\"Thanks to Dr. MacPhail. And also thanks to someone who,111I suspect, was definitely practicing medicine without a license. What onearth did you do to me yesterday afternoon?\"Susila smiled. \"You did it to yourself,\" she assured him. \"I merelypressed the buttons.\"\"Which buttons?\"\"Memory buttons, imagination buttons.\"\"And that was enough to put me into a hypnotic trance?\"\"If you like to call it that.\"\"What else can one call it?\"\"Why call it anything?

Will lookedat her with astonishment. Here, suddenly, was a different person, anotherSusila MacPhail, gay, mischievous, ironical.\"I know your tricks,\" he added, joining in the laughter.\"Tricks?\" Still laughing, she shook her head. \"I was just explaining howI did it.\"\"I know exactly how you did it.

Laughed because he had seen the goodness of Molly and then,with open eyes, had chosen the pink alcove and, with it, Molly'sunhappiness, Molly's death, his own gnawing sense of guilt, and then thepain, out of all proportion to its low and essentially farcical cause, theagonizing pain that he had felt when Babs in due course did what any foolmust have known she inevitably would do—turned himout of her infernalgin-illumined paradise, and took another lover.\"What's the matter?\" Susila asked.\"Nothing. Why do you ask?\"\"Because you're not very good at hiding your feelings. You werethinking of something that made you unhappy.\"\"You've got sharp eyes,\" he said, and looked away.There was a long silence. Should he tell her? Tell her about116IslandBabs, about poor Molly, about himself, tell her all the dismal andsenseless things he had never, even when he was drunk, told even hisoldest friends? Old friends knew too much about one, too much about theother parties involved, too much about the grotesque and complicatedgame which (as an English gentleman who was also a bohemian, also awould-be poet, also—in mere despair, because he knew he could never bea good poet—a hard-boiled journalist, and the private agent, very well paid,of a rich man whomhe despised) he was always so elaborately playing.No, old friends would never do. But from this dark little outsider, thisstranger to whomhe already owed so much and with whom, though heknew nothing about her, he was already so intimate, there would come noforegone conclusions, no ex parte judgments—would come perhaps, hefound himself hoping (he who had trained himself never to hope!), someunexpected enlightenment, some positive and practical help.

Without looking at Susila (for that,he felt, would be indecent), he began to speak.\"Dr. MacPhail told me something about. . . about what happened toyour husband.\"The words turned a sword in her heart; but that was to be expected,that was right and inevitable. \"It'll be four months next Wednesday,\" shesaid.

It's like shifting gears: you have to go into neutral beforeyou change into high.\"\"Or low,\" said Will. \"In my case, the shift wasn't up, it was down. No,not even down; it was into reverse. The first time it happened I was waitingfor a bus to take me home fromFleet Street. Thousands upon thousands ofpeople, all on the move, and each of themunique, each of themthe centerof the universe. Then the sun came out frombehind a cloud. Everythingwas extraordinarily bright and clear; and suddenly, with an almost audibleclick, they were all maggots.\"\"Maggots?\"\"You know, those little pale worms with black heads that one sees onrotten meat. Nothing had changed, of course; people's faces were thesame, their clothes were the same. And yet they were all maggots. Noteven real maggots—just the ghosts of maggots, just the illusion ofmaggots. And I was the illusion of a spectator of maggots. I lived in thatmaggot world for months. Lived in it, worked in it, went out to lunch anddinner in it—all without the least interest in what I was doing. Without theleast enjoyment or relish, completely desireless and, as I discovered when Itried to make love to a young woman I'd had occasional fun with in thepast, completely impotent.\"\"What did you expect?\""},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"119\"Precisely that.\"\"Then why on earth . . . ?\"Will gave her one of his flayed smiles and shrugged his shoulders. \"Asa matter of scientific interest. I was an entomologist investigating the sexlife of the phantom maggot.\"\"After which, I suppose, everything seemed even more unreal.\"\"Even more,\" he agreed, \"if that was possible.\"\"But what brought on the maggots in the first place?\"\"Well, to begin with,\" he answered, \"I was my parents' son. By BullyBoozer out of Christian Martyr. And on top of being my parents' son,\" hewent on after a little pause, \"I was my aunt Mary's nephew.\"\"What did your aunt Mary have to do with it?\"\"She was the only person I ever loved, and when I was sixteen she gotcancer. Off with the right breast; then, a year later, off with the left. Andafter that nine months of X rays and radiation sickness. Then it got into theliver, and that was the end. I was rhere from start to finish. For a boy in histeens it was a liberal education—but liberal.\"\"In what?\" Susila asked.\"In Pure and Applied Pointlessness. And a few weeks after i he closeof my private course in the subject came the grand opening of the publiccourse. World War II. Followed by the nonstop refresher course of ColdWar I. And all this time I'd been wanting to be a poet and finding out that Isimply don't have what it takes. And then, after the war, I had to go intojournalismto make money. What I wanted was to go hungry, if necessary,but try to write something decent—good prose at least, seeing that itcouldn't be good poetry. But I'd reckoned without those darling parents ofmine. By the time he died, in lanuary of 'forty-six, my father had got rid of allthe little money our family had inherited and by the time she was blessedlya widow, my mother was crippled with arthritis and had to be sup-120Islandported. So there I was in Fleet Street, supporting her with an ease and asuccess that were completely humiliating.\"\"Why humiliating?\"\"Wouldn't you be humiliated if you found yourself making money byturning out the cheapest, flashiest kind of literary forgery? I was a success"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"because I was so irremediably second-rate.\"\"And the net result of it all was maggots?\"He nodded. \"Not even real maggots: phantom maggots. And here'swhere Molly came into the picture. I met her at a high-class maggot party inBloomsbury. We were introduced, we made some politely inaneconversation about nonobjective painting. Not wanting to see any moremaggots, I didn't look at her; but she must have been looking at me. Mollyhad very pale gray-blue eyes,\" he added parenthetically, \"eyes that saweverything—she was incredibly observant, but observed without malice orcensoriousness, seeing the evil, if it was there, but never condemning it,just feeling enormously sorry for the person who was under compulsion tothink those thoughts and do that odious kind of thing. Well, as I say, shemust have been looking at me while we talked; for suddenly she asked mewhy I was so sad. I'd had a couple of drinks and there was nothingimpertinent or offensive about the way she asked the question; so I told herabout the maggots. 'And you're one of them,' I finished up, and for the firsttime I looked at her. 'A blue-eyed maggot with a face like one of the holywomen in attendance at a Flemish crucifixion.' \"\"Was she flattered?\"\"I think so. She'd stopped being a Catholic; but she still had a certainweakness for crucifixions and holy women. Anyhow, next morning shecalled me at breakfast time. Would I like to drive down into the country withher? It was Sunday and, by a miracle, fine. I accepted. We spent an hour ina hazel copse, picking primroses and looking at the little white windflowers.One doesn't pick the windflowers,\" he explained, \"because in an hour121they're withered. I did a lot of looking in that hazel copse—looking atflowers with the naked eye and then looking into themthrough themagnifying glass that Molly had brought with her. I don't know why, but itwas extraordinarily therapeutic—just looking into the hearts of primrosesand anemones. For the rest of the day I saw no maggots. But Fleet Streetwas still there, waiting for me, and by lunchtime on Monday the whole placewas crawling with themas thickly as ever. Millions of maggots. But now Iknew what to do about them. That evening I went to Molly's studio.\"\"Was she a painter?\"\"Not a real painter, and she knew it. Knew it and didn't resent it, justmade the best of having no talent. She didn't paint for art's sake; shepainted because she liked looking at things, liked the process of trying"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"meticulously to reproduce what she saw. That evening she gave me acanvas and a palette, and told me to do likewise.\" \"And did it work?\"\"It worked so well that when a couple of months later I cut open arotten apple, the wormat its center wasn't a maggot—not subjectively, Imean. Objectively, yes; it was all that a maggot should be, and that's how Iportrayed it, how we both portrayed it—for we always painted the samethings at the same time.\"\"What about the other maggots, the phantommaggots outside theapple?\"\"Well, I still had relapses, especially in Fleet Street and at cocktailparties; but the maggots were definitely fewer, definitely less haunting. Andmeanwhile something new was happening in the studio. I was falling inlove—falling in love because love is catching and Molly was so obviously inlove with me—why, God only knows.\"\"I can see several possible reasons why. She might have loved youbecause . . .\" Susila eyed himappraisingly and smiled. \"Well, becauseyou're quite an attractive kind of queer fish.\"122IslandHe laughed. \"Thank you for a handsome compliment.\"\"On the other hand,\" Susila went on, \"(and this isn't quite socomplimentary), she might have loved you because you made her feel sodamned sorry for you.\"\"That's the truth, I'mafraid. Molly was a born Sister of Mercy.\"\"And a Sister of Mercy, unfortunately, isn't the same as a Wife ofLove.\"\"Which I duly discovered,\" he said.\"After your marriage, I suppose.\"Will hesitated for a moment. \"Actually,\" he said, \"it was before. Notbecause, on her side, there had been any urgency of desire, but onlybecause she was so eager to do anything to please me. Only because, onprinciple, she didn't believe in conventions and was all for freely loving, andmore surprisingly\" (he remembered the outrageous things she would socasually and placidly give utterance to even in his mother's presence) \"allfor freely talking about that freedom.\"\"You knew it beforehand,\" Susila summed up, \"and yet you stillmarried her.\"Will nodded his head without speaking.\"Because you were a gentleman, I take it, and a gentleman keeps his"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"word.\"\"Partly for that rather old-fashioned reason, but also because I was inlove with her.\"\" Were you in love with her?\"\"Yes. No, I don't know. But at the time I did know. At least I thought Iknew. I was really convinced that I was really in love with her. And I knew, Istill know, why I was convinced. I was grateful to her for having exorcisedthose maggots. And besides the gratitude there was respect. There wasadmiration. She was so much better and honester than I was. Butunfortunately, you're right: a Sister of Mercy isn't the same as a Wife ofLove.123But I was ready to take Molly on her own terms, not on mine. I wasready to believe that her terms were better than mine.\"\"How soon,\" Susila asked, after a long silence, \"did you start havingaffairs on the side?\"Will smiled his flayed smile. \"Three months to the day after ourwedding. The first time was with one of the secretaries at the office.Goodness, what a bore! After that there was a young painter, acurlyheaded little Jewish girl whomMolly had helped with money while shewas studying at the Slade. I used to go to her studio twice a week, fromfiveto seven. It was almost three years before Molly found out about it.\"\"And, I gather, she was upset?\"\"Much more than I'd ever thought she'd be.\"\"So what did you do about it?\"Will shook his head. \"This is where it begins to get complicated,\" hesaid. \"I had no intention of giving up my cocktail hours with Rachel; but Ihated myself for making Molly so unhappy. At the same time I hated her forbeing unhappy. I resented her suffering and the love that had made hersuffer; I felt that they were unfair, a kind of blackmail to force me to give upmy innocent fun with Rachel. By loving me so much and being somiserable about what I was doing—what she really forced me to do—shewas putting pressure on me, she was trying to restrict my freedom. Butmeanwhile she was genuinely unhappy; and though I hated her forblackmailing me with her unhappiness, I was filled with pity for her. Pity,\" herepeated, \"not compassion. Compassion is suffering-with, and what Iwanted at all costs was to spare myself the pain her suffering caused me,and avoid the painful sacrifices by which I could put an end to her suffering."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Pity was my answer, being sorry for her from the outside, if you see what Imean—sorry for her as a spectator, an aesthete, a connoisseur inexcruciations. And this aesthetic pity of mine was so intense, every timeher unhappiness124Islandcame to a head, that I could almost mistake it for love. Almost, but neverquite. For when I expressed my pity in physical tenderness (which I didbecause that was the only way of putting a temporary stop to herunhappiness and to the pain her unhappi-ness was inflicting on me), thattenderness was always frustrated'i; before it could come to its naturalconsummation. Frustrated because, by temperament, she was only aSister of Mercy, not a wife. And yet, on every level but the sensual, sheloved me with a total commitment—a commitment that called for ananswering commitment on my part. But I wouldn't commit myself, maybe Igenuinely couldn't. So instead of being grateful for her self-giving, Iresented it. It made claims on me, claims that I refused to acknowledge. Sothere we were, at the end of every crisis, back at the beginning of the olddrama—the drama of a love incapable of sensuality self-committed to asensuality incapable of love and evoking strangely mixed responses of guiltand exasperation, of pity and resentment, sometimes of real hatred (butalways with an undertone of remorse), the whole accompanied by, contra-puntal to, a succession of furtive evenings with my little curly-headedpainter.\"\"I hope at least they were enjoyable,\" said Susila.He shrugged his shoulders. \"Only moderately. Rachel could neverforget that she was an intellectual. She had a way of asking what onethought of Piero di Cosimo at the most inopportune moments. The realenjoyment and of course the real agony—I never experienced themuntilBabs appeared on the scene.\"\"When was that?\"\"Just over a year ago. In Africa.\"\"Africa?\"\"I'd been sent there by Joe Aldehyde.\"\"That man who owns newspapers?\"\"\"And, all the rest. He was married to Molly's aunt Eileen. Anexemplary family man, I may add. That's why he's so serenely125"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"convinced of his own righteousness, even when he's engaged in the mostnefarious financial operations.\"\"And you're working for him?\"Will nodded. \"That was his wedding present to Molly—a job for me onthe Aldehyde papers at almost twice the salary I'd been getting from myprevious employers. Princely! But then he was very fond of Molly.\"\"How did he react to Babs?\"\"He never knew about her—never knew that there was any reason forMolly's accident.\"\"So he goes on employing you for your dead wife's sake?\"Will shrugged his shoulders. \"The excuse,\" he said, \"is that I have mymother to support.\"\"And of course you wouldn't enjoy being poor.\"\"I certainly wouldn't.\"There was a silence.\"Well,\" said Susila at last, \"let's get back to Africa.\"\"I'd been sent there to do a series on Negro Nationalism. Not tomention a little private hanky-panky in the business line lor Uncle Joe. Itwas on the plane, flying home from Nairobi. I found myself sitting next toher.\"\"Next to the young woman you couldn't have liked less?\"\"Couldn't have liked less,\" he repeated, \"or disapproved of more. But ifyou're an addict you've got to have your dope—the dope that you know inadvance is going to destroy you.\"\"It's a funny thing,\" she said reflectively, \"but in Pala we have liardlyany addicts.\"\"Not even sex addicts?\"\"The sex addicts are also person addicts. In other words, they'relovers.\"\"But even lovers sometimes hate the people they love.\"\"Naturally. Because I always have the same name and the same noseand eyes, it doesn't follow that I'm always the same126Islandwoman. Recognizing that fact and reacting to it sensibly—that's part of theArt of Loving.\"As succinctly as he could, Will told her the rest of the story. It was thesame story, now that Babs had come on the scene, as it had been before—"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"the same but much more so. Babs had been Rachel raised, so to speak, toa higher power—Rachel squared, Rachel to the rath. And the unhappinessthat, because of Babs, he had inflicted upon Molly was proportionatelygreater than anything she had had to suffer on account of Rachel.Proportionately greater, too, had been his own exasperation, his ownresentful sense of being blackmailed by her love and suffering, his ownremorse and pity, his own determination, in spite of the remorse and thepity, to go on getting what he wanted, what he hated himself for wanting,what he resolutely refused to do without. And meanwhile Babs had becomemore demanding, was claiming ever more and more of his time—time notonly in the strawberry-pink alcove, but also outside, in restaurants, andnightclubs, at her horrible friends' cocktail parties, on weekends in thecountry. \"Just you and me, darling,\" she would say, \"all alone together.\" Allalone together in an isolation that gave him the opportunity to plumb thealmost unfathomable depths of her mindlessness and vulgarity. But throughall his boredomand distaste, all his moral and intellectual repugnance, thecraving persisted. After one of those dreadful weekends, he was ashopelessly a Babs addict as he had been before. And on her side, on herown Sister-of-Mercy level, Molly had remained, in spite of everything, noless hopelessly a Will Farnaby addict. Hopelessly so far as he wasconcerned—for his one wish was that she should love him less and allowhimto go to hell in peace. But, so far as Molly herself was concerned, theaddiction was always and irre-pressibly hopeful. She never ceased toexpect the transfiguring miracle that would change himinto the kind,unselfish, loving Will Farnaby whom(in the teeth of all the evidence, all therepeated disappointments) she stubbornly insisted on regarding127as his true self. It was only in the course of that last fatal interview, onlywhen (stifling his pity and giving free rein to his resentment of herblackmailing unhappiness) he had announced his intention of leaving herand going to live with Babs—it was only then that hope had finally givenplace to hopelessness. \"Do you mean it, Will—do you really mean it?\" \"Ireally mean it.\" It was in hopelessness, in utter hopelessness, that she hadwalked out to the car, had driven away into the rain—into her death. At thefuneral, when the coffin was lowered into the grave, he had promisedhimself that he would never see Babs again. Never, never, never again.That evening, while he was sitting at his desk trying to write an article on\"What's Wrong with Youth,\" trying not to remember the hospital, the open"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"grave, and his own responsibility for everything that had happened, he wasstartled by the shrill buzzing of the doorbell. A belated message ofcondolence, no doubt. . . He had opened, and there, instead of thetelegram, was Babs—dramatically without makeup and all in black.\"My poor, poor Will!\" They had sat down on the sofa in the living room,and she had stroked his hair and both of them had cried.\"When pain and anguish wring the brow, a ministering angel thou.\" Anhour later, needless to say, they were naked and in bed. After which he hadmoved, earth to earth, into the pink alcove. Within three months, as anyfool could have foreseen, Babs had begun to tire of him; within four, anabsolutely divine man fromKenya had turned up at a cocktail party. Onething had led to another and when, three days later, Babs came home, itwas to prepare the alcove for a new tenant and give notice to the old.\"Do you really mean it, Babs?\" She really meant it.There was a rustling in the bushes outside the window and an instantlater, standingly loud and slightly out of time, \"Here and now, boys,\"shouted a talking bird.128Island\"Shut up!\" Will shouted back.\"Here and now, boys,\" the mynah repeated. \"Here and now, boys.Here and—\"\"Shut up!\"There was silence.\"I had to shut him up,\" Will explained, \"because of course he'sabsolutely right. Here, boys; now, boys. Then and there are absolutelyirrelevant. Or aren't they? What about your husband's death, for example?Is that irrelevant?\"Susila looked at himfor a moment in silence, then slowly nodded herhead. \"In the context of what I have to do now—yes, completely irrelevant.That's something I had to learn.\"\"Does one learn how to forget?\"\"It isn't a matter of forgetting. What one has to learn is how toremember and yet be free of the past. How to be there with the dead andyet still be here, on the spot, with the living.\" She gave him a sad little smileand added, \"It isn't easy.\"\"It isn't easy,\" Will repeated. And suddenly all his defenses were down,all his pride had left him. \"Will you help me?\" he asked.\"It's a bargain,\" she said, and held out her hand."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"A sound of footsteps made themturn their heads. Dr. MacPhail hadentered the room.129\"Good evening, my dear. Good evening, Mr. Farnaby.\"The tone was cheerful—not, Susila was quick to notice, with any kindof synthetic cheerfulness, but naturally, genuinely. And yet, before cominghere, he must have stopped at the hospital, must have seen Lakshmi asSusila herself had seen her only an hour or two since, more dreadfullyemaciated than ever, more skull-like and discolored. Half a long lifetime oflove and lovalty and mutual forgiveness—and in another day or two itwould be all over; he would be alone. But sufficient unto the day is the evilthereof-—sufficient unto the place and the person. \"One has no right,\" herfather-in-law had said to her one day as they were leaving the hospitaltogether, \"one has no right to inflict one's sadness on other people. And noright, of course, to pretend that one isn't sad. One just has to accept one'sgrief and one's absurd attempts to be a stoic. Accept, accept...\" His voicebroke. Looking up at him, she saw that his face was wet with tears. Fiveminutes later they were sitting on a bench, at the edge of the lotus pool, inthe shadow of the huge stone Buddha. With a little plop, sharp and yetliquidly voluptuous, an unseen frog dived from its round leafy platform intothe water. Thrusting up from130Islandthe mud, the thick green stems with their turgid buds broke through into theair, and here and there the blue or rosy symbols of enlightenment hadopened their petals to the sun and the probing visitations of flies and tinybeetles and the wild bees fromthe jungle. Darting, pausing in mid-flight,darting again, a score of glittering blue and green dragonflies were hawkingformidges.\"Tathata,\" Dr. Robert had whispered. \"Suchness.\"For a long time they sat there in silence. Then, suddenly, he hadtouched her shoulder.\"Look!\"She lifted her eyes to where he was pointing. Two small parrots hadperched on the Buddha's right hand and were going through the ritual ofcourtship."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"\"Did you stop again at the lotus pool?\" Susila asked aloud.Dr. Robert gave her a little smile and nodded his head.\"How was Shivapuram?\" Will enquired.\"Pleasant enough in itself,\" the doctor answered. \"Its only defect is thatit's so close to the outside world. Up here one can simply ignore theorganized insanities and get on with one's work. Down there, with all thoseantennae and listening posts and channels of communication that agovernment has to have, the outside world is perpetually breathing downone's neck. One hears it, feels it, smells it—yes, smells it.\"\"Has anything more than usually disastrous happened since I've beenhere?\"\"Nothing out of the ordinary at your end of the world. I wish I could saythe same about our end.\"\"What's the trouble?\"\"The trouble is our next-door neighbor, Colonel Dipa. To begin with,he's made another deal with the Czechs.\"\"More armaments?\"\"Sixty million dollars' worth. It was on the radio this morning.\"131\"But what on earth for?\"\"The usual reasons. Glory and power. The pleasures of vanity and thepleasures of bullying. Terrorism and military parades at home; conquestsand Te Deums abroad. And that brings me to the second itemofunpleasant news. Last night the Colonel delivered another of his celebratedGreater Rendang speeches.\" \"Greater Rendang? What's that?\"\"You may well ask,\" said Dr. Robert. \"Greater Rendang is the territorycontrolled by the Sultans of Rendang-Lobo between 1447 and 1483. Itincluded Rendang, the Nicobar Islands, about thirty percent of Sumatra andthe whole of Pala. Today, it's Colonel Dipa's Irredenta.'\" \"Seriously?\"\"With a perfectly straight face. No, I'm wrong. With a purple, distortedface and at the top of a voice that he has trained, after long practice, tosound exactly like Hitler's. Greater Rendang or death!\"\"But the great powers would never allow it.\" \"Maybe they wouldn't liketo see himin Sumatra. But Pala—that's another matter.\" He shook hishead. \"Pala, unfortunately, is in nobody's good books. We don't want theCommunists; but neither do we want the capitalists. Least of all do we wantthe wholesale industrialization that both parties are so anxious to imposeon us—for different reasons, of course. The West wants it because our"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"labor costs are low and investors' dividends will be correspondingly high.And the East wants it because industrialization will create a proletariat,open fresh fields for Communist agitation and may lead in the long run tothe setting up of yet another People's Democracy. We say no to both ofyou, so we're unpopular everywhere. Regardless of their ideologies, all theGreat Powers may prefer a Rendang-controlled Pala with oil fields to anindependent Pala without. If Dipa attacks us, they'll say it's mostdeplorable; but they won't lift a finger. And when he takes us over and callsthe oilmen in, they'll be delighted.\"132Island\"What can you do about Colonel Dipa?\" Will asked.\"Except for passive resistance, nothing. We have no army and nopowerful friends. The Colonel has both. The most we can do, if he startsmaking trouble, is to appeal to the United Nations. Meanwhile we shallremonstrate with the Colonel about this latest Greater Rendang effusion.Remonstrate through our minister in Rendang-Lobo, and remonstrate withthe great man in person when he pays his state visit to Pala ten days fromnow.\"\"A state visit?\"\"For the young Raja's coming-of-age celebrations. He was asked along time ago, but he never let us know for certain whether he was comingor not. Today it was finally settled. We'll have a summit meeting as well asa birthday party. But let's talk about something more rewarding. How didyou get on today, Mr. Farnaby?\"\"Not merely well—gloriously. I had the honor of a visit fromyourreigning monarch.\"\"Murugan?\"\"Why didn't you tell me he was your reigning monarch?\"Dr. Robert laughed. \"You might have asked for an interview.\"\"Well, I didn't. Nor fromthe Queen Mother.\"\"Did the Rani come too?\"\"At the command of her Little Voice. And, sure enough, the Little Voicesent her to the right address. My boss, Joe Aldehyde, is one of her dearestfriends.\"\"Did she tell you that she's trying to bring your boss here, to exploit ouroil?\"\"She did indeed.\"\"We turned down his latest offer less than a month ago. Did you know"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"that?\"Will was relieved to be able to answer quite truthfully that he didn't.Neither Joe Aldehyde nor the Rani had told him of this most recent rebuff.\"My job,\" he went on, a little less truthfully, \"is in the wood-pulp department,not in petroleum.\" There was133a silence. \"What's my status here?\" he asked at last. \"Undesirable alien?\"\"Well, fortunately you're not an armament salesman.\"\"Nor a missionary,\" said Susila.\"Nor an oilman—though on that count you might be guilty byassociation.\"\"Nor even, so far as we know, a uraniumprospector.\"\"Those,\" Dr. Robert concluded, \"are the Alpha Plus undesirables. As ajournalist you rank as a Beta. Not the kind of person we should ever dreamof inviting to Pala. But also not the kind who, having managed to get here,requires to be summarily deported.\"\"I'd like to stay here for as long as it's legally possible,\" said Will.\"May I ask why?\"Will hesitated. As Joe Aldehyde's secret agent and a reporter with ahopeless passion for literature, he had to stay long enough to negotiatewith Bahu and earn his year of freedom. But there were other, moreavowable reasons. \"If you don't object to personal remarks,\" he said, \"I'll tellyou.\"\"Fire away,\" said Dr. Robert.\"The fact is that, the more I see of you people the better I like you. Iwant to find out more about you. And in the process,\" he added, glancing atSusila, \"I might find out some interesting things about myself. How longshall I be allowed to stay?\"\"Normally we'd turn you out as soon as you're fit to travel. But if you'reseriously interested in Pala, above all if you're seriously interested inyourself—well, we might stretch a point. Or shouldn't we stretch that point?What do you say, Susila? After all, he does work for Lord Aldehyde.\"Will was on the point of protesting again that his job was in the wood-pulp department; but the words stuck in his throat and he said nothing. Theseconds passed. Dr. Robert repeated his question.134Island"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"\"Yes,\" Susila said at last, \"we'd be taking a certain risk. But personally. . . personally I'd be ready to take it. Am I right?\" she turned to Will.\"Well, I think you can trust me. At least I hope you can.\" He laughed,trying to make a joke of it; but to his annoyance and embarrassment, he felthimself blushing. Blushing for what? he demanded resentfully of hisconscience. If anybody was being double-crossed, it was Standard ofCalifornia. And once Dipa had moved in, what difference would it makewho got the concession? Which would you rather be eaten by—a wolf or atiger? So far as the lamb is concerned, it hardly seems to matter. Joe wouldbe no worse than his competitors. All the same, he wished he hadn't beenin such a hurry to send off that letter. And why, why couldn't that dreadfulwoman have left himin peace?Through the sheet he felt a hand on his undamaged knee. Dr. Robertwas smiling down at him.\"You can have a month here,\" he said. \"I'll take full responsibility foryou. And we'll do our best to show you everything.\"\"I'm very grateful to you.\"\"When in doubt,\" said Dr. Robert, \"always act on the assumption thatpeople are more honorable than you have any solid reason for supposingthey are. That was the advice the Old Raja gave me when I was a youngman.\" Turning to Susila, \"Let's see,\" he said, \"how old were you when theOld Raja died?\"\"Just eight.\"\"So you remember himpretty well.\"Susila laughed. \"Could anyone ever forget the way he used to talkabout himself. 'Quote \"I\" (unquote) like sugar in my tea.' What a darlingman.\"\"And what a great one!\"Dr. MacPhail got up and, crossing to the bookcase that stood betweenthe door and the wardrobe, pulled out of its lowest shelf a thick red album,much the worse for tropical weather and135fish insects. \"There's a picture of him somewhere,\" he said as he turnedover the pages. \"Here we are.\"Will found himself looking at the faded snapshot of a little old Hindu inspectacles and a loincloth, engaged in emptying the contents of anextremely ornate silver sauceboat over a small squat pillar.\"What is he doing?\" he asked."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"\"Anointing a phallic symbol with melted butter,\" the doctor answered.\"It was a habit my poor father could never break himof.\"\"Did your father disapprove of phalluses?\"\"No, wo,\" said Dr. MacPhail. \"My father was all for them. It was thesymbol that he disapproved of.\"\"Why the symbol?\"\"Because he thought that people ought to take their religion warm fromthe cow, if you see what I mean. Not skimmed or pasteurized orhomogenized. Above all not canned in any kind of theological or liturgicalcontainer.\"\"And the Raja had a weakness for containers?\"\"Not for containers in general. Just this one particular tin can. He'dalways felt a special attachment to the family lingam. It was made of blackbasalt, and was at least eight hundred years old.\"\"I see,\" said Will Farnaby.\"Buttering the family lingam—it was an act of piety, it expressed abeautiful sentiment about a sublime idea. But even the sublimest of ideas istotally different from the cosmic mystery it's supposed to stand for. And thebeautiful sentiments connected with the sublime idea—what do they havein common with the direct experience of the mystery? Nothing whatsoever.Needless to say, the Old Raja knew all this perfectly well. Better than myfather. He'd drunk the milk as it came from the cow, he'd actually been themilk. But the buttering of lingams was a devotional practice he just couldn'tbear to give up. And, I don't have to tell you, he should never have beenasked to give it up.136IslandBut where symbols were concerned, my father was a puritan. He'damended Goethe—Alles vergdnglkhe ist nicht ein Gleich-nis. His ideal waspure experimental science at one end of the spectrumand pureexperimental mysticism at the other. Direct experience on every level andthen clear, rational statements about those experiences. Lingams andcrosses, butter and holy water, sutras, gospels, images, chanting—he'dhave liked to abolish themall.\"\"Where would the arts have come in?\" Will questioned.\"They wouldn't have come in at all,\" Dr. MacPhail answered. \"And thatwas my father's blindest spot—poetry. He said he liked it; but in fact hedidn't. Poetry for its own sake, poetry as an autonomous universe, outthere, in the space between direct experience and the symbols of"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"science—that was something he simply couldn't understand. Let's find hispicture.\"Dr. MacPhail turned back the pages of the album and pointed to acraggy profile with enormous eyebrows.\"What a Scotsman!\" Will commented.\"And yet his mother and his grandmother were Palanese.\"\"One doesn't see a trace of them.\"\"Whereas his grandfather, who hailed fromPerth, might almost havepassed for a Rajput.\"Will peered into the ancient photograph of a young man with an ovalface and black side-whiskers, leaning his elbow on a marble pedestal onwhich, bottomupwards, stood his inordinately tall top hat.\"Your great-grandfather?\"\"The first MacPhail of Pala. Dr. Andrew. Born 1822, in the RoyalBurgh, where his father, James MacPhail, owned a rope mill. Which wasproperly symbolical; for James was a devout Calvinist, and beingconvinced that he himself was one of the elect, derived a deep and glowingsatisfaction from the thought of all those millions of his fellow men goingthrough life with the137noose of predestination about their necks, and Old Nobodaddy Aloftcounting the minutes to spring the trap.\"Will laughed.\"Yes,\" Dr. Robert agreed, \"it does seempretty comic. But it didn't then.Then it was serious—much more serious than the H-bomb is today. It wasknown for certain that ninety-nine point nine percent of the human racewere condemned to everlasting brimstone. Why? Either because they'dnever heard of Jesus; or, if they had, because they couldn't believesufficiently strongly that Jesus had delivered them from the brimstone. Andthe proof that they didn't believe sufficiently strongly was the empirical,observable fact that their souls were not at peace. Perfect faith is definedas something that produces perfect peace of mind. But perfect peace ofmind is something that practically nobody possesses. Therefore practicallynobody possesses perfect faith. Therefore practically everybody ispredestined to eternal punishment. Quod erat demonstrandum.''''\"One wonders,\" said Susila, \"why they didn't all go mad.\"\"Fortunately most of thembelieved only with the tops of their heads.Up here.\" Dr. MacPhail tapped his bald spot. \"With the tops of their heads"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"they were convinced it was the Truth with the largest possible T. But theirglands and their guts knew better—knew that it was all sheer bosh. Formost of them, Truth was true only on Sundays, and then only in a strictlyPickwickian sense. James MacPhail knew all this and was determined thathis children should not be mere Sabbath-day believers. They were tobelieve every word of the sacred nonsense even on Mondays, even onhalf-holiday afternoons; and they were to believe with their whole being, notmerely up there, in the attic. Perfect faith and the perfect peace that goeswith it were to be forced into them. How? By giving them hell now andthreatening them with hell hereafter. And if, in their devilish perversity, theyrefused to have perfect faith, and be at peace, give them more hell and138Islandthreaten hotter fires. And meanwhile tell them that good works are as filthyrags in the sight of God; but punish themferociously for everymisdemeanor. Tell them that by nature they're totally depraved, then beatthemfor being what they inescapably are.\"Will Farnaby turned back to the album.\"Do you have a picture of this delightful ancestor of yours?\"\"We had an oil painting,\" said Dr. MacPhail. \"But the dampness wastoo much for the canvas, and then the fish insects got into it. He was asplendid specimen. Like a High Renaissance picture of Jeremiah. Youknow—majestic, with an inspired eye and the kind of prophetic beard thatcovers such a multitude of physiognomic sins. The only relic of himthatremains is a pencil drawing of his house.\"He turned back another page and there it was.\"Solid granite,\" he went on, \"with bars on all the windows. And, insidethat cozy little family Bastille, what systematic inhumanity! Systematicinhumanity in the name, needless to say, of Christ and for righteousness'sake. Dr. Andrew left an unfinished autobiography, so we know all about it.\"\"Didn't the children get any help from their mother?\"Dr. MacPhail shook his head.\"Janet MacPhail was a Cameron and as good a Calvinist as Jameshimself. Maybe an even better Calvinist than he was. Being a woman, shehad further to go, she had more instinctive decencies to overcome. But shedid overcome them—heroically.

Sadismwith anulterior motive, sadismin the service of an ideal, as the expression of areligious conviction. And that's a subject,\" he added, turning to Will, \"thatsomebody ought to make a historical study of—the relation betweentheology and corporal punishment in childhood. I have a theory that,wherever little boys and girls are systematically flagellated, the victims growup to think of God as 'Wholly Other'—isn't that the fashionable argot in yourpart of the world? Wherever, on the contrary, children are brought upwithout being subjected to physical violence, God is immanent. A people'stheology reflects the state of its children's bottoms. Look at the Hebrews—enthusiastic child-beaters. And so were all good Christians in the Ages ofFaith. Hence Jehovah, hence Original Sin and the infinitely offended Fatherof Roman and Protestant orthodoxy. Whereas among Buddhists andHindus education has always been nonviolent. No laceration of littlebuttocks—therefore tat tvamasi, thou art That, mind from Mind is notdivided. And look at the Quakers. They were heretical enough to believe inthe Inner Light, and what happened? They gave up beating their childrenand were the first Christian denomination to protest against the institution ofslavery.\"\"But child-beating,\" Will objected, \"has quite gone out of fashionnowadays. And yet it's precisely at this moment that it has become modishto hold forth about the Wholly Other.\"Dr. MacPhail waved the objection away. \"It's just a case of reactionfollowing action. By the second half of the nineteenth century freethinkinghumanitarianismhad become so strong that even good Christians wereinfluenced by it and stopped beating their children. There were no weals onthe younger generation's posterior; consequently, it ceased to think of Godas the Wholly Other and proceeded to invent New Thought, Unity, ChristianScience—all the semi-Oriental heresies in which God is the WhollyIdentical. The movement was well under way in140Island"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"William James's day, and it's been gathering momentumever since.But thesis always invites antithesis and in due course the heresies begatNeo-Orthodoxy. Down with the Wholly Identical and back to the WhollyOther! Back to Augustine, back to Martin Luther—back, in a word, to thetwo most relentlessly flagellated bottoms in the whole history of Christianthought. Read the Confessions, read the Table Talk. Augustine was beatenby his schoolmaster and laughed at by his parents when he complained,Luther was systematically flogged not only by his teachers and his father,but even by his loving mother. The world has been paying for the scars onhis buttocks ever since. Prussianismand the Third Reich—without Lutherand his flagellation theology these monstrosities could never have comeinto existence. Or take the flagellation theology of Augustine, as carried toits logical conclusions by Calvin and swallowed whole by pious folk likeJames MacPhail and Janet Cameron. Major premise: God is Wholly Other.Minor premise: man is totally depraved. Conclusion: Do to your children'sbottoms what was done to yours, what your Heavenly Father has beendoing to the collective bottomof humanity ever since the Fall: whip, whip,whip!\"There was a silence. Will Farnaby looked again at the drawing of thegranite person in the rope walk, and thought of all the grotesque and uglyphantasies promoted to the rank of supernatural facts, all the obscenecruelties inspired by those phantasies, all the pain inflicted and the miseriesendured because of them. And when it wasn't Augustine with his\"benignant asperity,\" it was Robespierre, it was Stalin; when it wasn'tLuther exhorting the princes to kill the peasants, it was a genial Maoreducing them to slavery.\"Don't you sometimes despair?\" he asked.Dr. MacPhail shook his head. \"We don't despair,\" he said, \"becausewe know that things don't necessarily have to be as bad as in fact they'vealways been.\"\"We know that they can be a great deal better,\" Susila added.141\"Know it because they already are a great deal better, here and now,on this absurd little island.\"\"But whether we shall be able to persuade you people to follow ourexample, or whether we shall even be able to preserve our tiny oasis ofhumanity in the midst of your worldwide wilderness of monkeys—that,alas,\" said Dr. MacPhail, \"is another question. One's justified in feeling"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"extremely pessimistic about the current situation. But despair, radicaldespair—no, I can't see any justification for that.\"\"Not even when you read history?\"\"Not even when I read history.\"\"I envy you. How do you manage to do it?\"\"By remembering what history is—the record of what human beingshave been impelled to do by their ignorance and the enormousbumptiousness that makes themcanonize their ignorance as a political orreligious dogma.\"He turned again to the album. \"Let's get back to the house in the RoyalBurgh, back to James and Janet, and the six children whomCalvin's God,in His inscrutable malevolence, had condemned to their tender mercies.'The rod and reproof bring wisdom; but a child left to himself bringeth hismother to shame.' Indoctrination reinforced by psychological stress andphysical torture—the perfect Pavlovian setup. But, unfortunately fororganized religion and political dictatorship, human beings are much lessreliable as laboratory animals than dogs. On Tom, Mary and Jean theconditioning worked as it was meant to work. Tombecame a minister, andMary married a minister and duly died in childbirth. Jean stayed at home,nursed her mother through a long grim cancer and for the next twentyyears was slowly sacrificed to the aging and finally senile and drivelingpatriarch. So far, so good. But with Annie, the fourth child, the patternchanged. Annie was pretty. At eighteen she was proposed to by a captainof dragoons. But the captain was an Anglican and his views on totaldepravity and God's good pleasure were crim-142Islandinally incorrect. The marriage was forbidden. It looked as though Anniewere predestined to share the fate of Jean. She stuck it out for ten years;then, at twenty-eight, she got herself seduced by the second mate of anEast Indiaman. There were seven weeks of almost frantic happiness—thefirst she had ever known. Her face was transfigured by a kind ofsupernatural beauty, her body glowed with life. Then the Indiaman sailedfor a two-year voyage for Madras and Macao. Four months later, pregnant,friendless and despairing, Annie threw herself into the Tay. MeanwhileAlexander, the next in line, had run away from school and joined acompany of actors. In the house by the rope walk nobody, thenceforward,was ever allowed to refer to his existence. And finally there was Andrew,the youngest, the Benjamin. What a model child! He was obedient, he"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"loved his lessons, he learned the Epistles by heart faster and moreaccurately than any of the other children had done. Then, just in time torestore her faith in human wickedness, his mother caught himone eveningplaying with his genitals. He was whipped till the blood came; was caughtagain a few weeks later and again whipped, sentenced to solitaryconfinement on bread and water, told that he had almost certainlycommitted the sin against the Holy Ghost and that it was undoubtedly onaccount of that sin that his mother had been afflicted with cancer. For therest of his childhood Andrew was haunted by recurrent nightmares of hell.Haunted, too, by recurrent temptations and, when he succumbed to them—which of course he did, but always in the privacy of the latrine at the bottomof the garden—by yet more terrifying visions of the punishments in store forhim.\"\"And to think,\" Will Farnaby commented, \"to think that people complainabout modern life having no meaning! Look at what life was like when it didhave a meaning. A tale told by an idiot or a tale told by a Calvinist? Giveme the idiot every time.\"\"Agreed,\" said Dr. MacPhail. \"But mightn't there be a third143possibility? Mightn't there be a tale told by somebody who is neither animbecile nor a paranoiac?\"\"Somebody, for a change, completely sane,\" said Susila.\"Yes, for a change,\" Dr. MacPhail repeated. \"For a blessed change.And luckily, even under the old dispensation, there were always plenty ofpeople whom even the most diabolic upbringing couldn't ruin. By all therules of the Freudian and Pavlovian games, my great-grandfather ought tohave grown up to be a mental cripple. In fact, he grew up to be a mentalathlete. Which only shows,\" Dr. Robert added parenthetically, \"howhopelessly inadequate your two highly touted systems of psychology reallyare. Freudismand behaviorism—poles apart but in complete agreementwhen it comes to the facts of the built-in, congenital differences betweenindividuals. How do your pet psychologists deal with these facts? Verysimply. They ignore them. They blandly pretend that the facts aren't there.Hence their complete inability to cope with the human situation as it reallyexists, or even to explain it theoretically. Look at what happened, for,example, in this particular case. Andrew's brothers and sisters were eithertamed by their conditioning or destroyed. Andrew was neither destroyednor tamed. Why? Because the roulette wheel of heredity had stopped"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"turning at a lucky number. He had a more resilient constitution than theothers, a different anatomy, different biochemistry and differenttemperament. His parents did their worst, as they had done with all the restof their unfortunate brood. Andrew came through with flying colors, almostwithout a scar.\"\"In spite of the sin against the Holy Ghost?\"\"That, happily, was something he got rid of during his first year ofmedical studies at Edinburgh. He was only a boy—just over seventeen.(They started young in those days.) In the dissecting roomthe boy foundhimself listening to the extravagant obscenities and blasphemies with whichhis fellow students kept144Islandup their spirits among the slowly rotting cadavers. Listening at first withhorror, with a sickening fear that God would surely take vengeance. Butnothing happened. The blasphemers flourished, the loud-mouthedfornicators escaped with nothing worse than a dose, every now and then,of the clap. Fear gave place in Andrew's mind to a wonderful sense of reliefand deliverance. Greatly daring, he began to risk a few ribald jokes of hisown. His first utterance of a four-letter word—what a liberation, what agenuinely religious experience! And meanwhile, in his spare time, he readTomJones, he read Hume's 'Essay on Miracles,' he read the infidelGibbon. Putting the French he had learned at school to good account, heread La Mettrie, he read Dr. Caba-nis. Man is a machine, the brainsecretes thought as the liver secretes bile. How simple it all was, howluminously obvious! With all the fervor of a convert at a revival meeting, hedecided for atheism. In the circumstances it was only to be expected. Youcan't stomach St. Augustine any more, you can't go on repeating theAthanasian rigmarole. So you pull the plug and send themdown the drain.What bliss! But not for very long. Something, you discover, is missing. Theexperimental baby was flushed out with the theological dirt and soapsuds.But nature abhors a vacuum. Bliss gives place to a chronic discomfort, andnow you're afflicted, generation after generation, by a succession ofWesleys, Puseys, Moodys and Billys—Sunday and Graham—all workinglike beavers to pump the theology back out of the cesspool. They hope, ofcourse, to recover the baby. But they never succeed. All that a revivalistcan do is to siphon up a little of the dirty water. Which, in due course, hasto be thrown out again. And so on, indefinitely. It's really too boring and, asDr. Andrew came at last to realize, wholly unnecessary. Meanwhile here he"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"was, in the first flush of his new-found freedom. Excited, exultant—butquietly excited, exultant behind that appearance of grave and courteousdetachment which he habitually presented to the world.\" \"What about hisfather?\" Will asked. \"Did they have a battle?\"145\"No battle. Andrew didn't like battles. He was the sort of man whoalways goes his own way, but doesn't advertise the fact, doesn't argue withpeople who prefer another road. The old man was never given theopportunity of putting on his Jeremiah act. Andrew kept his mouth shutabout Hume and La Mettrie and went through the traditional motions. Butwhen his training was finished, he just didn't come home. Instead, he wentto London and signed up, as surgeon and naturalist, on HMS Melampus,bound for the South Seas with orders to chart, survey, collect specimensand protect Protestant missionaries and British interests. The cruise of theMelampus lasted for a full three years. They called at Tahiti, they spent twomonths on Samoa and a month in the Marquesas group. After Perth, theislands seemed like Eden—but an Eden innocent unfortunately not only ofCalvinism and capitalismand industrial slums, but also of Shakespeare andMozart, also of scientific knowledge and logical thinking. It was paradise,but it wouldn't do, it wouldn't do. They sailed on. They visited Fiji and theCarolines and the Solomons. They charted the northern coast of NewGuinea and, in Borneo, a party went ashore, trapped a pregnant orangutanand climbed to the top of Mount Kinabalu. Then followed a week at Panay,a fortnight in the Mergui Archipelago. After which they headed west to theAndamans and fromthe Andamans to the mainland of India. While ashore,my great-grandfather was thrown from his horse and broke his right leg.The captain of the Melampus found another surgeon and sailed for home.Two months later, as good as new, Andrew was practicing medicine atMadras. Doctors were scarce in those days and sickness fearfully common.The young man began to prosper. But life among the merchants andofficials of the presidency was oppressively boring. It was an exile, but anexile without any of the compensations of exile, an exile without adventureor strangeness, a banishment merely to the provinces, to the tropicalequivalent of Swansea or Hudders-field. But still he resisted the temptationto book a passage on the146Island"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"next homebound ship. If he stuck it out for five years, he would haveenough money to buy a good practice in Edinburgh—no, in London, in theWest End. The future beckoned, rosy and golden. There would be a wife,preferably with auburn hair and a modest competence. There would be fouror five children—happy, unwhipped and atheistic. And his practice wouldgrow, his patients would be drawn fromcircles ever more exalted. Wealth,reputation, dignity, even a knighthood. Sir Andrew MacPhail stepping out ofhis broughamin Belgrave Square. The great Sir Andrew, physician to theQueen. Summoned to St. Petersburg to operate on the Grand Duke, to theTuileries, to the Vatican, to the Sublime Porte. Delightful phantasies! Butthe facts, as it turned out, were to be far more interesting. One fine morninga brown-skinned stranger called at the surgery. In halting English he gavean account of himself. He was from Pala and had been commanded by HisHighness, the Raja, to seek out and bring back with hima skillful surgeonfromthe West. The rewards would be princely. Princely, he insisted. Thereand then Dr. Andrew accepted the invitation. Partly, of course, for themoney; but mostly because he was bored, because he needed a change,needed a taste of adventure. A trip to the Forbidden Island—the lure wasirresistible.\"\"And remember,\" Susila interjected, \"in those days Pala was muchmore forbidden than it is now.\"\"So you can imagine how eagerly young Dr. Andrew jumped at theopportunity now offered by the Raja's ambassador. Ten days later his shipdropped anchor off the north coast of the forbidden island. With hismedicine chest, his bag of instruments, and a small tin trunk containing hisclothes and a few indispensable books, he was rowed in an outriggercanoe through the pounding surf, carried in a palanquin through the streetsof Shivapuramand set down in the inner courtyard of the royal palace. Hisroyal patient was eagerly awaiting him. Without being given time to shaveor change his clothes, Dr. Andrew was147ushered into the presence—the pitiable presence of a small brown man inhis early forties, terribly emaciated under his rich brocades, his face soswollen and distorted as to be barely human, his voice reduced to a hoarsewhisper. Dr. Andrew examined him. Fromthe maxillary antrum, where ithad its roots, a tumor had spread in all directions. It had filled the nose, ithad pushed up into the socket of the right eye, it had half blocked thethroat. Breathing had become difficult, swallowing acutely painful, and"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"sleep an impossibility—for whenever he dropped off, the patient wouldchoke and wake up frantically struggling for air. Without radical surgery, itwas obvious, the Raja would be dead within a couple of months. Withradical surgery, much sooner. Those were the good old days, remember—the good old days of septic operations without benefit of chloroform. Evenin the most favorable circumstances surgery was fatal to one patient out offour. Where conditions were less propitious, the odds declined—fifty-fifty,thirty to seventy, zero to a hundred. In the present case the prognosis couldhardly have been worse. The patient was already weak and the operationwould be long, difficult and excruciatingly painful. There was a good chancethat he would die on the operating table and a virtual certainty that, if hesurvived, it would only be to die a few days later of blood poisoning. But ifhe should die, Dr. Andrew now reflected, what would be the fate of thealien surgeon who had killed a king? And, during the operation, who wouldhold the royal patient down while he writhed under the.knife? Which of hisservants or courtiers would have the strength of mind to disobey, when themaster screamed in agony or positively commanded them to let himgo?\"Perhaps the wisest thing would be to say, here and now, that the casewas hopeless, that he could do nothing, and ask to be sent back to Madrasforthwith. Then he looked again at the sick man. Through the grotesquemask of his poor deformed face the Raja was looking at himintently—looking with the eyes of a148Islandcondemned criminal begging the judge for mercy. Touched by the appeal,Dr. Andrew gave hima smile of encouragement and all at once, as hepatted the thin hand, he had an idea. It was absurd, crackbrained,thoroughly discreditable; but all the same, all the same ...\"Five years before, he suddenly remembered, while he was still atEdinburgh, there had been an article in The Lancet, an article denouncingthe notorious Professor Elliotson for his advocacy of animal magnetism.Elliotson had had the effrontery to talk of painless operations performed onpatients in the mesmeric trance.\"The man was either a gullible fool or an unscrupulous knave. The so-called evidence for such nonsense was manifestly worthless. It was allsheer humbug, quackery, downright fraud—and so on for six columns ofrighteous indignation. At the time—for he was still full of La Mettrie andHume and Cabanis—Dr. Andrew had read the article with a glow oforthodox approval. After which he had forgotten about the very existence of"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"animal magnetism. Now, at the Raja's bedside, it all came back to him—themad professor, the magnetic passes, the amputations without pain, the lowdeath rate and the rapid recoveries. Perhaps, after all, there might besomething in it. He was deep in these thoughts when, breaking a longsilence, the sick manspoke to him. Froma young sailor who had desertedhis ship atRendang-Lobo and somehow made his way across the Strait,the Raja had learned to speak English with remarkable fluency, but , also,in faithful imitation of his teacher, with a strong Cockney accent. ThatCockney accent,\" Dr. MacPhail repeated with a little laugh. \"It turns upagain and again in my great-grandfather's memoirs. There was something,to him, inexpressibly improper about a king who spoke like Sam Weller.And in this case the impropriety was more than merely social. Besidesbeing a king, the Raja was a man of intellect and the most exquisiterefinement; a man, not only of deep religious convictions (any crude149oaf can have deep religious convictions), but also of deep religiousexperience and spiritual insight. That such a man should express himself inCockney was something that an Early Victorian Scotsman who had readThe Pickwick Papers could never get over. Nor, in spite of all my great-grandfather's tactful coaching, could the Raja ever get over his impurediphthongs and dropped aitches. But all that was in the future. At their firsttragic meeting, that shocking, lower-class accent seemed strangelytouching. Laying the palms of his hands together in a gesture ofsupplication, the sick man whispered, ' 'Elp me, Dr. MacPhile, 'elp me.'\"The appeal was decisive. Without any further hesitation, Dr. Andrewtook the Raja's thin hands between his own and began to speak in themost confident tone about a wonderful new treatment recently discoveredin Europe and employed as yet by only a handful of the most eminentphysicians. Then, turning to the attendants who had been hovering all thistime in the background, he ordered themout of the room. They did notunderstand the words; but his tone and accompanying gestures wereunmistakably clear. They bowed and withdrew. Dr. Andrew took off hiscoat, rolled up his shirt sleeves and started to make those famous magneticpasses, about which he had read with so much skeptical amusement inThe Lancet. From the crown of the head, over the face and down the trunkto the epigastrium, again and again until the patient falls into a trance—'oruntil' (he remembered the derisive comments of the anonymous writer ofthe article) 'until the presiding charlatan shall choose to say that his dupe is"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"now under the magnetic influence.' Quackery, humbug and fraud. But allthe same, all the same ... He worked away in silence. Twenty passes, fiftypasses. The sick man sighed and closed his eyes. Sixty, eighty, a hundred,a hundred and twenty. The heat was stifling, Dr. Andrew's shirt wasdrenched with sweat, and his arms ached. Grimly he repeated the sameabsurd gesture. A hundred and fifty, a hundred and seventy-five, two150Islandhundred. It was all fraud and humbug; but all the same he was determinedto make this poor devil go to sleep, even if it took him the whole day to doit. 'You are going to sleep,' he said aloud as he made the two hundred andeleventh pass. 'You are going to sleep.' The sick man seemed to sink moredeeply into his pillows, and suddenly Dr. Andrew caught the sound of arattling wheeze. 'This time,' he added quickly, 'you are not going to choke.There's plenty of roomfor the air to pass, and you're not going to choke.'The Raja's breathing grew quiet. Dr. Andrew made a few more passes,then decided that it would be safe to take a rest. He mopped his face, thenrose, stretched his arms and took a couple of turns up and down the room.Sitting down again by the bed, he took one of the Raja's sticklike wrists andfelt for the pulse. An hour before it had been running at almost a hundred;now the rate had fallen to seventy. He raised the arm: the hand hung limplike a dead man's. He let go, and the arm dropped by its own weight andlay, inert and unmoving, where it had fallen. 'Your Highness,' he said, andagain, more loudly, 'Your Highness.' There was no answer. It was allquack-ery, humbug and fraud, but all the same it worked, it obviouslyworked.\"A large, brightly colored mantis fluttered down onto the rail at the footof the bed, folded its pink and white wings, raised its small flat head, andstretched out its incredibly muscular front legs in the attitude of prayer. Dr.MacPhail pulled out a magnify-ing glass and bent forward to examine it.\"Gongylus gongyloides,\" he pronounced. \"It dresses itself up to looklike a flower. When unwary flies and moths come sailing in to sip thenectar, it sips them. And if it's a female, she eats her lovers.\" He put theglass away and leaned back in his chair. \"What one likes most about theuniverse,\" he said to Will Farnaby, \"is its wild improbability. Gongylusgongyloides, Homo sapiens, my great grandfather's introduction to Palaand hypnosis—what could be more unlikely?\"151"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"\"Nothing,\" said Will. \"Except perhaps my introduction to Pala andhypnosis, Pala via a shipwreck and a precipice; hypnosis by way of asoliloquy about an English cathedral.\"Susila laughed. \"Fortunately I didn't have to make all those passesover you. In this climate! I really admire Dr. Andrew. It sometimes takesthree hours to anesthetize a person with the passes.\"\"But in the end he succeeded?\"\"Triumphantly.\"\"And did he actually performthe operation?\"\"Yes, he actually performed the operation,\" said Dr. MacPhail. \"But notimmediately. There had to be a long preparation. Dr. Andrew began bytelling his patient that henceforward he would be able to swallow withoutpain. Then, for the next three weeks, he fed himup. And between meals heput himinto trance and kept himasleep until it was time for anotherfeeding. It's wonderful what your body will do for you if you only give it achance. The Raja gained twelve pounds and felt like a new man. A newman full of new hope and confidence. He knew he was going to comethrough his ordeal. And so, incidentally, did Dr. Andrew. In the process offortifying the Raja's faith he had fortified his own. It was not a blind faith.The operation, he felt quite certain, was going to be successful. But thisunshakable confidence did not prevent himfromdoing everything thatmight contribute to its success. Very early in the proceedings he started towork on the trance. The trance, he kept telling his patient, was becomingdeeper every day, and on the day of the operation it would be much deeperthan it had ever been before. It would also last longer. 'You'll sleep,' heassured the Raja, 'for four full hours after the operation's over; and whenyou awake, you won't feel the slightest pain.' Dr. Andrew made theseaffirmations with a mixture of total skepticism and complete confidence.Reason and past experience assured him that all this was impossible. Butin the present context past experience had152Islandproved to be irrelevant. The impossible had already happened, severaltimes. There was no reason why it shouldn't happen again. The importantthing was to say that it would happen—so he said it, again and again. Allthis was good; but better still was Dr. Andrew's invention of the rehearsal.\"\"Rehearsal of what?\"\"Of the surgery. They ran through the procedure half a dozen times."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The last rehearsal was on the morning of the operation. At six, Dr. Andrewcame to the Raja's room and, after a little cheerful talk, began to make thepasses. In a few minutes the patient was in deep trance. Stage by stage,Dr. Andrew described what he was going to do. Touching the cheekbonenear the Raja's right eye, he said, T begin by stretching the skin. And nowwith this scalpel' (and he drew the tip of a pencil across the cheek) 'I makean incision. You feel no pain, of course—not even the slightest discomfort.And now the underlying tissues are being cut and you still feel nothing atall. You just lie there, comfortably asleep, while I dissect the cheek back tothe nose. Every now and then I stop to tie a blood vessel; then I go onagain. And when that part of the work is done, I'mready to start on thetumor. It has its roots there in the antrumand it has grown upwards, underthe cheekbone, into the eye socket, and downwards into the gullet. And asI cut it loose, you lie there as before, feeling nothing, perfectly comfortable,completely relaxed. And now I lift your head.' Suiting his action to thewords, he lifted the Raja's head and bent it forward on the limp neck. 'I lift itand bend it so that you can get rid of the blood that's run down into yourmouth and throat. Some of the blood has got into your windpipe, and youcough a little to get rid of it; but it doesn't wake you.' The Raja coughedonce or twice, then, when Dr. Andrew released his hold, dropped back ontothe pillows, still fast asleep. 'And you don't choke even when I work on thelower end of the tumor in your gullet.' Dr. Andrew opened the Raja's mouthand thrust two fingers down his throat. 'It's153just a question of pulling it loose, that's all. Nothing in that to make youchoke. And if you have to cough up the blood, you can do it in your sleep.Yes, in your sleep, in this deep, deep sleep.'\"That was the end of the rehearsal. Ten minutes later, after makingsome more passes and telling his patient to sleep still more deeply, Dr.Andrew began the operation. He stretched the skin, he made the incision,he dissected the cheek, he cut the tumor away fromits roots in the antrum.The Raja lay there perfectly relaxed, his pulse firmand steady at seventy-five, feeling no more pain than he had felt during the make-believe of therehearsal. Dr. Andrew worked on the throat; there was no choking. Theblood flowed into the windpipe; the Raja coughed but did not awake. Fourhours after the operation was over, he was still sleeping; then, punctual tothe minute, he opened his eyes, smiled at Dr. Andrew between hisbandages and asked, in his singsong Cockney, when the operation was to"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"start. After a feeding and a sponging, he was given some more passes andtold to sleep for four more hours and to get well quickly. Dr. Andrew kept itup for a full week. Sixteen hours of trance each day, eight of waking. TheRaja suffered almost no pain and, in spite of the thoroughly septicconditions under which the operation had been performed and thedressings renewed, the wounds healed without suppuration. Rememberingthe horrors he had witnessed in the Edinburgh infirmary, the yet morefrightful horrors of the surgical wards at Madras, Dr. Andrew could hardlybelieve his eyes. And now he was given another opportunity to prove tohimself what animal magnetism could do. The Raja's eldest daughter wasin the ninth monthof her first pregnancy. Impressed by what he haddone for her husband, the Rani sent for Dr. Andrew. He found her sittingwith a frail frightened girl of sixteen, who knew just enough broken Cockneyto be able to tell himshe was going to die—she and her baby too. Threeblack birds had confirmed it by flying on three successive days across154Islandher path. Dr. Andrew did not try to argue with her. Instead, he asked her tolie down, then started to make the passes. Twenty minutes later the girlwas in a deep trance. In his country, Dr. Andrew now assured her, blackbirds were lucky—a presage of birth and joy. She would bear her childeasily and without pain. Yes, with no more pain than her father had feltduring his operation. No pain at all, he promised, no pain whatsoever.\"Three days later, and after three or four more hours of intensivesuggestion, it all came true. When the Raja woke up for his evening meal,he found his wife sitting by his bed. 'We have a grandson,' she said, 'andour daughter is well. Dr. Andrew has said that tomorrow you may be carriedto her room, to give them both your blessing.' At the end of a month theRaja dissolved the Council of Regency and resumed his royal powers.Resumed them, in gratitude to the man who had saved his life and (theRani was convinced of it) his daughter's life as well, with Dr. Andrew as hischief adviser.\"\"So he didn't go back to Madras?\"\"Not to Madras. Not even to London. He stayed here in Pala.\"\"Trying to change the Raja's accent?\"\"And trying, rather more successfully, to change the Raja's kingdom.\"\"Into what?\"\"That was a question he couldn't have answered. In those early dayshe had no plan-—only a set of likes and dislikes. There were things about"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Pala that he liked, and plenty of others that he didn't like at all. Thingsabout Europe that he detested, and things he passionately approved of.Things he had seen on his travels that seemed to make good sense, andthings that filled himwith disgust. People, he was beginning to understand,are at once the beneficiaries and the victims of their culture. It brings themto flower; but it also nips themin the bud or plants a155canker at the heart of the blossom. Might it not be possible, on thisforbidden island, to avoid the cankers, minimize the nip-pings, and makethe individual blooms more beautiful? That was the question to which,implicitly at first, then with a growing awareness of what they were really upto, Dr. Andrew and the Raja were trying to find an answer.\"\"And did they find an answer?\"\"Looking back,\" said Dr. MacPhail, \"one's amazed by what those twomen accomplished. The Scottish doctor and the Palaneseking, theCalvinist-turned-atheist andthepious Mahayana Buddhist—what astrangely assorted pair! But a pair, very soon, of firmfriends; a pair,moreover, of complementary temperaments and talents, withcomplementary philosophies and complementary stocks of knowledge,each man supplying the other's deficiencies, each stimulating and fortifyingthe other's native capacities. The Raja's was an acute and subtle mind; buthe knew nothing of the world beyond the confines of his island, nothing ofphysical science, nothing of European technology, European art, Europeanways of thinking. No less intelligent, Dr. Andrew knew nothing, of course,about Indian painting and poetry and philosophy. He also knew nothing, ashe gradually discovered, about the science of the human mind and the artof living. In the months that followed the operation each became the other'spupil and the other's teacher. And of course that was only a beginning.They were not merely private citizens concerned with their privateimprovement. The Raja had a million subjects and Dr. Andrew was virtuallyhis prime minister. Private improvement was to be the preliminary to publicimprovement. If the king and the doctor were now teaching one another tomake the best of both worlds—the Oriental and the European, the ancientand the modern—it was in order to help the whole nation to do the same.To make the best of both worlds—what amI saying? To make the best ofall the worlds—156Island"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"the worlds already realized within the various cultures and, beyond them,the worlds of still unrealized potentialities. It was an enormous ambition, anambition totally impossible of fulfillment; but at least it had the merit ofspurring themon, of making them rush in where angels feared to tread—with results that sometimes proved, to everybody's astonishment, that theyhad not been quite such fools as they looked. They never succeeded, ofcourse, in making the best of all the worlds; but by dint of boldly trying theymade the best of many more worlds than any merely prudent or sensibleperson would have dreamed of being able to reconcile and combine.\"\" 'If the fool would persist in his folly,' \" Will quoted from The Proverbsof Hell, \" 'he would become wise.' \"\"Precisely,\" Dr. Robert agreed. \"And the most extravagant folly of all isthe folly described by Blake, the folly that the Raja and Dr. Andrew werenow contemplating—the enormous folly of trying to make a marriagebetween hell and heaven. But if you persist in that enormous folly, what anenormous reward! Provided, of course, that you persist intelligently. Stupidfools get nowhere; it's only the knowledgeable and clever ones whose follycan make them wise or produce good results. Fortunately these two foolswere clever. Clever enough, for example, to embark on their folly in amodest and appealing way. They began with pain relievers. The Palanesewere Buddhists. They knew how misery is related to mind. You cling, youcrave, you assert yourself—and you live in a homemade hell. You becomedetached—and you live in peace. 'I show you sorrow,' the Buddha hadsaid, 'and I show you the ending of sorrow.' Well, here was Dr. Andrew witha special kind of mental detachment which would put an end at least to onekind of sorrow, namely, physical pain. With the Raja himself or, for thewomen, the Rani and her daughter acting as interpreters, Dr. Andrew gavelessons in his new-found art to groups of midwives and physicians, ofteachers, mothers, invalids.157Painless childbirth—and forthwith all the women of Pala wereenthusiastically on the side of the innovators. Painless operations for stoneand cataract and hemorrhoids—and they had won the approval of all theold and the ailing. At one stroke more than half the adult populationbecame their allies, prejudiced in their favor, friendly in advance, or at leastopen-minded, toward the next reform.\"\"Where did they go frompain?\" Will asked."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"\"To agriculture and language. To bread and communication. They gota man out fromEngland to establish Rothamsted-in-the-Tropics, and theyset to work to give the Palanese a second language. Pala was to remain aforbidden island; for Dr. Andrew wholeheartedly agreed with the Raja thatmissionaries, planters and traders were far too dangerous to be tolerated.But, while the foreign subversives must not be allowed to come in, thenatives must somehow be helped to get out—if not physically, at least withtheir minds. But their language and their archaic version of the Brahmialphabet were a prison without windows. There could be no escape forthem, no glimpse of the outside world until they had learned English andcould read the Latin script. Among the courtiers, the Raja's linguisticaccomplishments had already set a fashion. Ladies and gentlemen lardedtheir conversation with scraps of Cockney, and some of themhad evensent to Ceylon for English-speaking tutors. What had been a mode wasnow transformed into a policy. English schools were set up and a staff ofBengali printers, with their presses and their fonts of Caslon and Bodoni,were imported fromCalcutta. The first English book to be published atShivapuram was a selection fromThe Arabian Nights, the second, atranslation of The Diamond Sutra, hitherto available only in Sanskrit and inmanuscript. For those who wished to read about Sindbad and Marouf, andfor those who were interested in the Wisdomof the Other Shore, therewere now two cogent reasons for learning English.158Island159That was the beginning of the long educational process that turned usat last into a bilingual people. We speak Palanese when we're cooking,when we're telling funny stories, when we're talking about love or making it.(Incidentally, we have the richest erotic and sentimental vocabulary inSoutheast Asia.) But when it comes to business, or science, or speculativephilosophy, we generally speak English. And most of us prefer to write inEnglish. Every writer needs a literature as his frame of reference; a set ofmodels to conform to or depart from. Pala had good painting and sculpture,splendid architecture, wonderful dancing, subtle and expressive music—butno real literature, no national poets or dramatists or storytellers. Just bardsreciting Buddhist and Hindu myths; just a lot of monks preaching sermonsand splitting metaphysical hairs. Adopting English as our stepmothertongue, we gave ourselves a literature with one of the longest pasts and"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"certainly the widest of presents. We gave ourselves a background, aspiritual yardstick, a repertory of styles and techniques, an inexhaustiblesource of inspiration. In a word, we gave ourselves the possibility of beingcreative in a field where we had never been creative before. Thanks to theRaja and my great-grandfather, there's an Anglo-Palanese literature—ofwhich, I may add, Susila here is a contemporary light.\"\"On the dim side,\" she protested.Dr. MacPhail shut his eyes, and, smiling to himself, began to recite:\"Thus-Gone to Thus-Gone, I with a Buddha's hand Offer the unpluckedflower, the frog's soliloquy Among the lotus leaves, the milk-smearedmouth At my full breast and love and, like the cloudless Sky that makespossible mountains and setting moon, This emptiness that is the womb oflove This poetry of silence.\"He opened his eyes again. \"And not only this poetry of silence,\" hesaid. \"This science, this philosophy, this theology of silence. And now it'shigh time you went to sleep.\" He rose and moved towards the door. \"I'll goand get you a glass of fruit juice.\"160Island\" 'Patriotism is not enough.' But neither is anything else. Science is notenough, religion is not enough, art is not enough, politics and economicsare not enough, nor is love, nor is duty, nor is action however disinterested,nor, however sublime, is contemplation.

He closed his Notes on What'sWhat and picking up the bamboo alpenstock which had once belonged toDugald MacPhail, he set out to keep his appointment with Vijaya and Dr.Robert. By the short cut the main building of the Experimental Station wasless than a quarter of a mile from Dr. Robert's bungalow. But the day wasoppressively hot, and there were two flights of steps to be negotiated. For aconvalescent with his right leg in a splint, it was a considerable journey.Slowly, painfully, Will made his way along the winding path and up thesteps. At the top of the second flight he halted to take breath and mop hisforehead; then keeping close to the wall, where there was still a narrowstrip of shade, he moved on towards a signboard marked laboratory.161"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The door beneath the board was ajar; he pushed it open and found himselfon the threshold of a long, high-ceilinged room. There were the usual sinksand worktables, the usual glass-fronted cabinets full of bottles andequipment, the usual smells of chemicals and caged mice. For the firstmoment Will was under the impression that the room was untenanted, butno—almost hidden fromview by a bookcase that projected at right anglesfromthe wall, young Murugan was seated at a table, intently reading. Asquietly as he could—for it was always amusing to take people by surprise—Will advanced into the room. The whirring of an electric fan covered thesound of his approach, and it was not until he was within a few feet of thebookcase that Murugan became aware of his presence. The boy startedguiltily, shoved his book with panic haste into aleather briefcase and,reaching for another, smaller volume that lay open on the table beside thebriefcase, drew it within reading range. Only then did he turn to face theintruder.Will gave hima reassuring smile. \"It's only me.\" The look of angrydefiance gave place, on the boy's face, to one of relief.\"I thought it was ...\" He broke off, leaving the sentence unfinished.\"You thought it was someone who would bawl you out for not doingwhat you're supposed to do—is that it?\"Murugan grinned and nodded his curly head.\"Where's everyone else?\" Will asked.\"They're out in the fields—pruning or pollinating or something.\" Histone was contemptuous.\"And so, the cats being away, the mouse duly played. What were youstudying so passionately?\"With innocent disingenuousness, Murugan held up the book he wasnow pretending to read. \"It's called Elementary Ecology\" he said.162Island\"So I see,\" said Will. \"But what I asked you was what were youreading?\"\"Oh, that,\" Murugan shrugged his shoulders. \"You wouldn't beinterested.\"\"I'minterested in everything that anyone tries to hide,\" Will assuredhim. \"Was it pornography?\"Murugan dropped his playacting and looked genuinely offended. \"Whodo you take me for?\"Will was on the point of saying that he took himfor an average boy, but"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"checked himself.

Taking the book, he leafedimpatiently through a score of additional pages.\"Look at this Italian Style Motor Scooter!\" And while Will looked,Murugan read aloud. \" 'This sleek Speedster gives up to 110 Miles perGallon of Fuel.'

He lookedagain at the picture of the motorbike, then back at Murugan's glowing face.Light dawned; the Colonel's purpose revealed itself. The serpent temptedme, and I did eat. The tree in the midst of the garden was called the Tree ofConsumer Goods, and to the inhabitants of every underdeveloped Edenthe tiniest taste of its fruit, and even the sight of its thirteen hundred andfifty-eight leaves, had power to bring the shameful knowledge that,industrially speaking, they were stark-naked.

Abruptly, the indignant spirit of the Rani tookflight, and Murugan was once again the conscience-stricken schoolboyfurtively trying to cover up his delinquencies. In a trice Elementary Ecologyhad taken the place of Sears, Roebuck, and the suspiciously bulgingbriefcase was under the table. A moment later, stripped to the waist andshining like oiled bronze with the sweat of labor in the noonday sun, Vijayacame striding into the room. Behind himcame Dr. Robert. With the air of amodel student, interrupted in the midst of his reading by trespassers fromthe frivolous outside world, Murugan looked up from his book. Amused, Willthrew himself at once wholeheartedly into the part that had been assignedto him.\"It was I who got here too early,\" he said in response to Vijaya'sapologies for their being so late. \"With the result that our young friend herehasn't been able to get on with his lessons. We've been talking our headsoff.\"\"What about?\" Dr. Robert asked.\"Everything. Cabbages, kings, motor scooters, pendulous abdomens.And when you came in, we'd just embarked on toadstools. Murugan wastelling me about the fungi that are used here as a source of dope.\"\"What's in a name?\" said Dr. Robert, with a laugh. \"Answer,"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"166Islandpractically everything. Having had the misfortune to be brought up inEurope, Murugan calls it dope and feels about it all the disapproval that, byconditioned reflex, the dirty word evokes. We, on the contrary, give the stuffgood names—the moksha-medicine, the reality revealer, the truth-and-beauty pill. And we know, by direct experience, that the good names aredeserved. Whereas our young friend here has no firsthand knowledge ofthe stuff and can't be persuaded even to give it a try. For him, it's dope anddope is something that, by definition, no decent person ever indulges in.\"\"What does His Highness say to that?\" Will asked.Murugan shook his head. \"All it gives you is a lot of illusions,\" hemuttered. \"Why should I go out of my way to be made a fool of?\"\"Why indeed?\" said Vijaya with good-humored irony. \"Seeing that, inyour normal condition, you alone of the human race are never made a foolof and never have illusions about anything!\"\"I never said that,\" Murugan protested. \"All I mean is that I don't wantany of your false samadhi.\"\"How do you know it's false?\" Dr. Robert enquired.\"Because the real thing only comes to people after years and years ofmeditation and tapas and . . . well, you know—not going with women.\"\"Murugan,\" Vijaya explained to Will, \"is one of the Puritans. He'soutraged by the fact that, with four hundred milligrams of moksha-medicinein their bloodstreams, even beginners—yes, and even boys and girls whomake love together—can catch a glimpse of the world as it looks tosomeone who has been liberated fromhis bondage to the ego.\"\"But it isn't real,\" Murugan insisted.\"Not real!\" Dr. Robert repeated. \"You might as well say that theexperience of feeling well isn't real.\"\"You're begging the question,\" Will objected. \"An experi-167ence can be real in relation to something going on inside your skull butcompletely irrelevant to anything outside.\"\"Of course,\" Dr. Robert agreed.\"Do you know what goes on inside your skull, when you've taken adose of the mushroom?\"\"We know a little.\"\"And we're trying all the time to find out more,\" Vijaya added."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"\"For example,\" said Dr. Robert, \"we've found that the people whoseEEG doesn't show any alpha-wave activity when they're relaxed aren'tlikely to respond significantly to the moksha-medicine. That means that, forabout fifteen percent of the population, we have to find other approaches toliberation.\"\"Another thing we're just beginning to understand,\" said Vijaya, \"is theneurological correlate of these experiences. What's happening in the brainwhen you're having a vision? And what's happening when you pass fromapremystical to a genuinely mystical state of mind?\"\"Do you know?\" Will asked.\" 'Know' is a big word. Let's say we're in a position to make someplausible guesses. Angels and New Jerusalems and Madonnas and FutureBuddhas—they're all related to some kind of unusual stimulation of thebrain areas of primary projection—the visual cortex, for example. Just howthe moksha-medicine produces those unusual stimuli we haven't yet foundout. The important fact is that, somehow or other, it does produce them.And somehow or other, it also does something unusual to the silent areasof the brain, the areas not specifically concerned with perceiving, ormoving, or feeling.\"\"And how do the silent areas respond?\" Will enquired.\"Let's start with what they don't respond with. They don't respond withvisions or auditions, they don't respond with telepathy or clairvoyance orany other kind of parapsychological168Island169performance. None of that amusing premystical stuff. Their response is thefull-blown mystical experience. You know—One in all and All in one. Thebasic experience with its corollaries—boundless compassion, fathomlessmystery and meaning.\"\"Not to mention joy,\" said Dr. Robert, \"inexpressible joy.\"\"And the whole caboodle is inside your skull,\" said Will. \"Strictlyprivate. No reference to any external fact except a toadstool.\"\"Not real,\" Murugan chimed in. \"That's exactly what I was trying tosay.\"\"You're assuming,\" said Dr. Robert, \"that the brain producesconsciousness. I'm assuming that it transmits consciousness. And myexplanation is no more farfetched than yours. How on earth can a set of"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"events belonging to one order be experienced as a set of events belongingto an entirely different and incommensurable order? Nobody has thefaintest idea. All one can do is to accept the facts and concoct hypotheses.And one hypothesis is just about as good, philosophically speaking, asanother. You say that the moksha-medicine does something to the silentareas of the brain which causes them to produce a set of subjective eventsto which people have given the name 'mystical experience.' / say that themoksha-medicine does something to the silent areas of the brain whichopens some kind of neurological sluice and so allows a larger volume ofMind with a large 'M' to flow into your mind with a small 'm.' You can'tdemonstrate the truth of your hypothesis, and I can't demonstrate the truthof mine. And even if you could prove that I'm wrong, would it make anypractical difference?\"\"I'd have thought it would make all the difference,\" said Will.\"Do you like music?\" Dr. Robert asked.\"More than most things.\"\"And what, may I ask, does Mozart's G-Minor Quintet refer to? Does itrefer to Allah? Or Tao? Or the second person of the Trinity? Or the Atman-Brahman?\"Will laughed. \"Let's hope not.\"\"But that doesn't make the experience of the G-Minor Quintet any lessrewarding. Well, it's the same with the kind of experience that you get withthe moksha-medicine, or through prayer and fasting and spiritual exercises.Even if it doesn't refer to anything outside itself, it's still the most importantthing that ever happened to you. Like music, only incomparably more so.And if you give the experience a chance, if you're prepared to go along withit, the results are incomparably more therapeutic and transforming. Somaybe the whole thing does happen inside one's skull. Maybe it is privateand there's no unitive knowledge of anything but one's own physiology.Who cares? The fact remains that the experience can open one's eyes andmake one blessed and transform one's whole life.\" There was a longsilence. \"Let me tell you something,\" he resumed, turning to Murugan.\"Something I hadn't intended to talk about to anybody. But now I feel thatperhaps I have a duty, a duty to the throne, a duty to Pala and all itspeople—an obligation to tell you about this very private experience.Perhaps the telling may help you to be a little more understanding aboutyour country and its ways.\" He was silent for a moment; then in a quietlymatter-of-fact tone, \"I suppose you know about my wife,\" he went on.His face still averted, Murugan nodded. \"I was sorry,\" he mumbled, \"tohear she was so ill.\""},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"\"It's a matter of a few days now,\" said Dr. Robert. \"Four or five at themost. But she's still perfectly lucid, perfectly conscious of what's happeningto her. Yesterday she asked me if we could take the moksha-medicinctogether. We'd taken it together,\" he added parenthetically, \"once or twiceeach year for the last thirty-seven years—ever since we decided to getmarried. And now once more—for the last time, the last, last time. Therewas a risk involved, because of the damage to the liver. But we decided itwas a risk worth taking. And as it turned out, we were right. The moksha-medicine—the dope, as you prefer to call it—170Islandhardly upset her at all. All that happened to her was the mentaltransformation.\"He was silent, and Will suddenly became aware of the squeak andscrabble of caged rats and, through the open window, the babel of tropicallife and the call of a distant mynah bird. \"Here and now, boys. Here andnow ...\"\"You're like that mynah,\" said Dr. Robert at last. \"Trained to repeatwords you don't understand or know the reason for, 'It isn't real. It isn't real.'But if you'd experienced what Lakshmi and I went through yesterday you'dknow better. You'd know it was much more real than what you call reality.More real than what you're thinking and feeling at this moment. More realthan the world before your eyes. But not real is what you've been taught tosay. Not real, not real.'\" Dr. Robert laid a hand affectionately on the boy'sshoulder. \"You've been told that we're just a set of self-indulgent dopetakers, wallowing in illusions and false samadhis. Listen, Murugan—forgetall the bad language that's been pumped into you. Forget it at least to thepoint of making a single experiment. Take four hundred milligrams ofmoksha-medicine and find out for yourself what it does, what it can tell youabout your own nature, about this strange world you've got to live in, learnin, suffer in, and finally die in. Yes, even you will have to die one day—maybe fifty years from now, maybe tomorrow. Who knows? But it's going tohappen, and one's a fool if one doesn't prepare for it.\" He turned to Will.\"Would you like to come along while we take our shower and get into someclothes?\"Without waiting for an answer, he walked out through the door that ledinto that central corridor of the long building. Will picked up his bamboostaff and, accompanied by Vijaya, followed himout of the room.\"Do you suppose that made any impression on Murugan?\" he asked"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Vijaya when the door had closed behind them.Vijaya shrugged his shoulders. \"I doubt it.\"171\"What with his mother,\" said Will, \"and his passion for internal-combustion engines, he's probably impervious to anything you people cansay. You should have heard himon the subject of motor scooters!\"\"We have heard him,\" said Dr. Robert, who had halted in front of ablue door and was waiting for them to come up with him. \"Frequently.When he comes of age, scooters are going to become a major politicalissue.\"Vijaya laughed. \"To scoot or not to scoot, that is the question.\"\"And it isn't only in Pala that it's the question,\" Dr. Robert added. \"It'sthe question that every underdeveloped country has to answer one way orthe other.\"\"And the answer,\" said Will, \"is always the same. Wherever I'vebeen—and I've been almost everywhere—they've opted wholeheartedly forscooting. All of them.\"\"Without exception,\" Vijaya agreed. \"Scooting for scooting's sake, andto hell with all considerations of fulfillment, self-knowledge, liberation. Not tomention common or garden health or happiness.\"\"Whereas we\" said Dr. Robert, \"have always chosen to adapt oureconomy and technology to human beings—not our human beings tosomebody else's economy and technology. We import what we can't make;but we make an import only what we can afford. And what we can afford islimited not merely by our supply of pounds and marks and dollars, but alsoprimarily—primarily\" he insisted—\"by our wish to be happy, our ambition tobecome fully human. Scooters, we've decided after carefully looking intothe matter, are among the things—the very numerous things—we simplycan't afford. Which is something poor little Murugan will have to learn thehard way—seeing that he hasn't learned, and doesn't want to learn, theeasy way.\"\"Which is the easy way?\" Will asked.\"Education and reality-revealers. Murugan has had neither.172IslandOr rather he's had the opposite of both. He's had miseducation inEurope—Swiss governesses, English tutors, American movies,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"everybody's advertisements—and he's had reality eclipsed for himby hismother's brand of spirituality. So it's no wonder he pines for scooters.\"\"But his subjects, I gather, do not.\"\"Why should they? They've been taught frominfancy to be fully awareof the world, and to enjoy their awareness. And, on top of that, they havebeen shown the world and themselves and other people as these areillumined and transfigured by reality-revealers. Which helps them, ofcourse, to have an intenser awareness and a more understandingenjoyment, so that the most ordinary things, the most trivial events, areseen as jewels and miracles. Jewels and miracles,\" he repeatedemphatically. \"So why should we resort to scooters or whisky or televisionor Billy Graham or any other of your distractions and compensations?\"\" 'Nothing short of everything will really do,' \" Will quoted. \"I see nowwhat the Old Raja was talking about. You can't be a good economist unlessyou're also a good psychologist. Or a good engineer without being the rightkind of metaphysician.\"\"And don't forget all the other sciences,\" said Dr. Robert.\"Pharmacology, sociology, physiology, not to mention pure and appliedautology, neurotheology, metachemistry, mycomysti-cism, and the ultimatescience,\" he added, looking away so as to be more alone with his thoughtsof Lakshmi in the hospital, \"the science that sooner or later we shall allhave to be examined in—thanatology.\" He was silent for a moment; then,in another tone, \"Well, let's go and get washed up,\" he said and, openingthe blue door, led the way into a long changing room with a row of showersand wash basins at one end and on the opposite wall, tiers of lockers and alarge hanging cupboard.Will took a seat and while his companions lathered themselves at thebasins, went on with their conversations.173\"Would it be permissible,\" he asked, \"for a miseducated alien to try atruth-and-beauty pill?\"The answer was another question. \"Is your liver in good order?\" Dr.Robert enquired.\"Excellent.\"\"And you don't seemto be more than mildly schizophrenic. So I can'tsee any counterindication.\"\"Then I can make the experiment?\"\"Whenever you like.\""},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"He stepped into the nearest shower stall and turned on the water.Vijaya followed suit.\"Aren't you supposed to be intellectuals?\" Will asked when the twomen had emerged again and were drying themselves.\"We do intellectual work,\" Vijaya answered.\"Then why all this horrible honest toil?\"\"For a very simple reason: this morning I had some spare time.\"\"So did I,\" said Dr. Robert.\"So you went out into the fields and did a Tolstoy act.\"Vijaya laughed. \"You seem to imagine we do it for ethical reasons.\"\"Don't you?\"\"Certainly not. I do muscular work, because I have muscles; and if Idon't use my muscles I shall become a bad-tempered sitting-addict.\"\"With nothing between the cortex and the buttocks,\" said Dr. Robert.\"Or rather with everything—but in a condition of complete unconsciousnessand toxic stagnation. Western intellectuals are all sitting-addicts. That's whymost of you are so repulsively unwholesome. In the past even a duke hadto do a lot of walking, even a moneylender, even a metaphysician. Andwhen they weren't using their legs, they were jogging about on horses.Whereas now, fromthe tycoon to his typist, from the174Islandlogical positivist to the positive thinker, you spend nine tenths of your timeon foamrubber. Spongy seats for spongy bottoms—at home, in the office,in cars and bars, in planes and trains and buses. No moving of legs, nostruggles with distance and gravity—just lifts and planes and cars, justfoamrubber and an eternity of sitting. The life force that used to find anoutlet through striped muscle gets turned back on the viscera and thenervous system, and slowly destroys them.\"\"So you take to digging and delving as a formof therapy?\" \"Asprevention—to make therapy unnecessary. In Pala even a professor, evena government official, generally puts in two hours of digging and delvingeach day.\" \"As part of his duties?\" \"And as part of his pleasure.\"Will made a grimace. \"It wouldn't be part of my pleasure.\" \"That'sbecause you weren't taught to use your mind-body in the right way,\" Vijayaexplained. \"If you'd been shown how to do things with the minimumofstrain and the maximumof awareness, you'd enjoy even honest toil.\"\"I take it that your children all get this kind of training.\" \"From the firstmoment they start doing for themselves. For example, what's the proper"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"way of handling yourself while you're buttoning your clothes?\" And suitingaction to words, Vijaya started to button the shirt he had just slipped into.\"We answer the question by actually putting their heads and bodies into thephysiologically best position. And we encourage themat the same time tonotice how it feels to be in the physiologically best position, to be aware ofwhat the process of doing up buttons consists of in terms of touches andpressures and muscular sensations. By the time they're fourteen they'velearned how to get the most and the best—objectively and subjectively—out of any activity they may undertake. And that's when we start themworking. Ninety minutes a day at some kind of manual job.\" \"Back to goodold child labor!\"175\"Or rather,\" said Dr. Robert, \"forward frombad new child idleness. Youdon't allow your teen-agers to work; so they have to blow off steamindelinquency or else throttle down steamtill they're ready to becomedomesticated sitting-addicts. And now,\" he added, \"it's time to be going. I'lllead the way.\"In the laboratory, when they entered, Murugan was in the act of lockinghis briefcase against all prying eyes. \"I'mready,\" he said and, tucking thethirteen hundred and fifty-eight pages of the Newest Testament under hisarm, he followed them out into the sunshine. A few minutes later, crammedinto an ancient jeep, the four of them were rolling along the road that led,past the paddock of the white bull, past the lotus pool and the huge stoneBuddha, out through the gate of the Station Compound to the highway. \"I'msorry we can't provide more comfortable transportation,\" said Vijaya as theybumped and rattled along.Will patted Murugan's knee. \"This is the man you should beapologizing to,\" he said. \"The one whose soul yearns for Jaguars andThunder birds.\"\"It's a yearning, I'm afraid,\" said Dr. Robert fromthe back seat, \"thatwill have to remain unsatisfied.\"Murugan made no comment, but smiled the secret contemptuoussmile of one who knows better.\"We can't import toys,\" Dr. Robert went on. \"Only essentials.\"\"Such as?\"\"You'll see in a moment.\" They rounded a curve, and there beneaththemwere the thatched roofs and tree-shaded gardens of a considerablevillage. Vijaya pulled up at the side of the road and turned off the motor."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"\"You're looking at New Rothamsted,\" he said. \"Alias Madalia. Rice,vegetables, poultry, fruit. Not to mention two potteries and a furniturefactory. Hence those wires.\" He waved his hand in the direction of the longrow of pylons that climbed up the terraced slope behind the village, dippedout of sight over the ridge, and reappeared, far away,176Islandmarching up fromthe floor of the next valley towards the green belt ofmountain jungle and the cloudy peaks beyond and above. \"That's one ofthe indispensable imports—electrical equipment. And when the waterfallshave been harnessed and you've strung up the transmission lines, here'ssomething else with a high priority.\" He directed a pointing finger at awindowless block of cement that rose incongruously from among thewooden houses near the upper entrance to the village.\"What is it?\" Will asked. \"Some kind of electric oven?\"\"No, the kilns are over on the other side of the village. This is thecommunal freezer.\"\"In the old days,\" Dr. Robert explained, \"we used to lose about half ofall the perishables we produced. Now we lose practically nothing. Whateverwe grow is for us, not for the circumambient bacteria.\"\"So now you have enough to eat.\"\"More than enough. We eat better than any other country in Asia, andthere's a surplus for export. Lenin used to say that electricity plus socialismequals communism. Our equations are rather different. Electricity minusheavy industry plus birth control equals democracy and plenty. Electricityplus heavy industry minus birth control equals misery, totalitarianismandwar.\"\"Incidentally,\" Will asked, \"who owns all this? Are you capitalists orstate socialists?\"\"Neither. Most of the time we're co-operators. Palanese agriculture hasalways been an affair of terracing and irrigation. But terracing and irrigationcall for pooled efforts and friendly agreements. Cutthroat competition isn'tcompatible with rice-growing in a mountainous country. Our people found itquite easy to pass frommutual aid in a village community to streamlinedcooperative techniques for buying and selling and profit sharing andfinancing.\"\"Even co-operative financing?\"Dr. Robert nodded. \"None of those bloodsucking usurers"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"177that you find all over the Indian countryside. And no commercial banks inyour Western style. Our borrowing and lending systemwas modeled onthose credit unions that WilhelmRaiffeisen set up more than a century agoin Germany. Dr. Andrew persuaded the Raja to invite one of Raiffeisen'syoung men to come here and organize a cooperative banking system. It'sstill going strong.\"\"And what do you use for money?\" Will asked.Dr. Robert dipped into his trouser pocket and pulled out a handful ofsilver, gold and copper.\"In a modest way,\" he explained, \"Pala's a gold-producing country. Wemine enough to give our paper a solid metallic backing. And the goldsupplements our exports. We can pay spot cash for expensive equipmentlike those transmission lines and the generators at the other end.\"\"You seem to have solved your economic problems prettysuccessfully.\"\"Solving them wasn't difficult. To begin with, we never allowedourselves to produce more children than we could feed, clothe, house, andeducate into something like full humanity. Not being overpopulated, wehave plenty. But, although we have plenty, we've managed to resist thetemptation that the West has now succumbed to—the temptation tooverconsume. We don't give ourselves coronaries by guzzling six times asmuch saturated fat as we need. We don't hypnotize ourselves into believingthat two television sets will make us twice as happy as one television set.And finally we don't spend a quarter of the gross national product preparingfor World War III or even World War's baby brother, Local WarMMMCCCXXXIII. Armaments, universal debt, and planned obsolescence—those are the three pillars of Western prosperity. If war, waste, andmoneylenders were abolished, you'd collapse. And while you people areoverconsuming the rest of the world sinks more and more deeply intochronic disaster. Ignorance, militarism and breeding, these three—and178Islandthe greatest of these is breeding. No hope, not the slightest possibility, ofsolving the economic problemuntil that's under control. As populationrushes up, prosperity goes down.\" He traced the descending curve with anoutstretched finger. \"And as prosperity goes down, discontent andrebellion\" (the forefinger moved up again), \"political ruthlessness and one-"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"party rule, nationalism and bellicosity begin to rise. Another ten or fifteenyears of uninhibited breeding, and the whole world, from China to Peru viaAfrica and the Middle East, will be fairly crawling with Great Leaders, alldedicated to the suppression of freedom, all armed to the teeth by Russiaor America or, better still, by both at once, all waving flags, all screamingfor Lebensraum.\"\"What about Pala?\" Will asked. \"Will you be blessed with a GreatLeader ten years from now?\"\"Not if we can help it,\" Dr. Robert answered. \"We've always doneeverything possible to make it very difficult for a Great Leader to arise.\"Out of the corner of his eye Will saw that Murugan was making a faceof indignant and contemptuous disgust. In his fancy Antinoiis evidently sawhimself as a Carlylean Hero. Will turned back to Dr. Robert.\"Tell me how you do it,\" he said.\"Well, to begin with we don't fight wars or prepare for them.Consequently, we have no need for conscription, or military hierarchies, ora unified command. Then there's our economic system: it doesn't permitanybody to become more than four or five times as rich as the average.That means that we don't have any captains of industry or omnipotentfinanciers. Better still, we have no omnipotent politicians or bureaucrats.Pala's a federation of self-governing units, geographical units, professionalunits, economic units—so there's plenty of scope for small-scale initiativeand democratic leaders, but no place for any kind of dictator at the head ofa centralized government. Another point: we have no established church,and our religion stresses immedi-179ate experience and deplores belief in unverifiable dogmas and theemotions which that belief inspires. So we're preserved fromthe plagues ofpopery, on the one hand, and fundamentalist revivalism, on the other. Andalong with transcendental experience we systematically cultivateskepticism. Discouraging children fromtaking words too seriously, teachingthemto analyze whatever they hear or read—this is an integral part of theschool curriculum. Result: the eloquent rabble-rouser, like Hitler or ourneighbor across the Strait, Colonel Dipa, just doesn't have a chance here inPala.\"This was too much for Murugan. Unable to contain himself, \"But lookat the energy Colonel Dipa generates in his people,\" he burst out. \"Look atall the devotion and self-sacrifice. We don't have anything like that here.\""},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"\"Thank God,\" said Dr. Robert devoutly.\"Thank God,\" Vijaya echoed.\"But these things are good,\" the boy protested. \"I admire them.\"\"I admire them too,\" said Dr. Robert. \"Admire themin the same way asI admire a typhoon. Unfortunately that kind of energy and devotion and self-sacrifice happens to be incompatible with liberty, not to mention reason andhuman decency. But decency, reason and liberty are what Pala has beenworking for, ever since the time of your namesake, Murugan the Reformer.\"Fromunder his seat Vijaya pulled out a tin box and, lifting the lid,distributed a first round of cheese and avocado sandwiches. \"We'll have toeat as we go.\" He started the motor and with one hand, the other beingbusy with his sandwich, swung the little car onto the road. \"Tomorrow,\" hesaid to Will, \"I'll show you the sights of the village, and the still moreremarkable sight of my family eating their lunch. Today we have anappointment in the mountains.\"Near the entrance to the village he turned the jeep into a side road thatwent winding steeply up between terraced fields of rice180Islandand vegetables, interspersed with-orchards and, here and there,plantations of young trees destined, Dr. Robert explained, to supply thepulp mills of Shivapuramwith their raw material.\"How many papers does Pala support?\" Will enquired and wassurprised to learn that there was only one. \"Who enjoys the monopoly? Thegovernment? The party in power? The local Joe Aldehyde?\"\"Nobody enjoys a monopoly,\" Dr. Robert assured him. \"There's apanel of editors representing half a dozen different parties and interests.Each of themgets his allotted space for comment and criticism. Thereader's in a position to compare their arguments and make up his ownmind. I remember how shocked I was the first time I read one of your big-circulation newspapers. The bias of the headlines, the systematic one-sided-ness of the reporting and the commentaries, the catchwords andslogans instead of argument. No serious appeal to reason. Instead, asystematic effort to install conditioned reflexes in the minds of the voters—and, for the rest, crime, divorce, anecdotes, twaddle, anything to keep themdistracted, anything to prevent them from thinking.\"The car climbed on and now they were on a ridge between twoheadlong descents, with a tree-fringed lake down at the bottom of a gorgeto their left and to the right a broader valley where, between two tree-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"shaded villages, like an incongruous piece of pure geometry, sprawled ahuge factory.\"Cement?\" Will questioned.Dr. Robert nodded. \"One of the indispensable industries. We produceall we need and a surplus for export.\"\"And those villages supply the manpower?\"\"In the intervals of agriculture and work in the forest and the sawmills.\"\"Does that kind of part-time systemwork well?\"\"It depends what you mean by 'well.' It doesn't result in maximumefficiency. But then in Pala maximumefficiency isn't181the categorical imperative that it is with you. You think first of getting thebiggest possible output in the shortest possible time. We think first ofhuman beings and their satisfactions. Changing jobs doesn't make for thebiggest output in the fewest days. But most people like it better than doingone kind of job all their lives. If it's a choice between mechanical efficiencyand human satisfaction, we choose satisfaction.\"\"When I was twenty,\" Vijaya now volunteered, \"I put in four months atthat cement plant—and after that ten weeks making superphosphates andthen six months in the jungle, as a lumberjack.\"\"All this ghastly honest toil!\"\"Twenty years earlier,\" said Dr. Robert, \"I did a stint at the coppersmelters. After which I had a taste of the sea on a fishing boat. Sampling allkinds of work—it's part of everybody's education. One learns an enormousamount that way—about things and skills and organizations, about all kindsof people and their ways of thinking.\"Will shook his head. \"I'd still rather get it out of a book.\"\"But what you can get out of a book is never it. At bottom,\" Dr. Robertadded, \"all of you are still Platonists. You worship the word and abhormatter!\"\"Tell that to the clergymen,\" said Will. \"They're always reproaching uswith being crass materialists.\"\"Crass,\" Dr. Robert agreed, \"but crass precisely because you're suchinadequate materialists. Abstract materialism—that's what you profess.Whereas we make a point of being materialists concretely—materialistic onthe wordless levels of seeing and touching and smelling, of tensed musclesand dirty hands. Abstract materialismis as bad as abstract idealism; itmakes immediate spiritual experience almost impossible. Sampling"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"different kinds of work in concrete materialismis the first, indispensablestep in our education for concrete spirituality.\"\"But even the most concrete materialism,\" Vijaya qualified,182Island\"won't get you very far unless you're fully conscious of what you'redoing and experiencing. You've got to be completely aware of the bits ofmatter you're handling, the skills you're practicing, the people you workwith.\"\"Quite right,\" said Dr. Robert. \"I ought to have made it clear thatconcrete materialismis only the raw stuff of a fully human life. It's throughawareness, complete and constant awareness, that we transformit intoconcrete spirituality. Be fully aware of what you're doing, and workbecomes the yoga of work, play becomes the yoga of play, everyday livingbecomes the yoga of everyday living.\"Will thought of Ranga and the little nurse. \"And what about love?\"Dr. Robert nodded. \"That too. Awareness transfigures it, turns love-making into the yoga of love-making.\"Murugan gave an imitation of his mother looking shocked.\"Psychophysical means to a transcendental end,\" said Vijaya, raisinghis voice against the grinding screech of the low gear into which he had justshifted, \"that, primarily, is what all these yogas are. But they're alsosomething else, they're also devices for dealing with the problems ofpower.\" He shifted back to a quieter gear and lowered his voice to itsnormal tone. \"The problems of power,\" he repeated. \"And they confront youon every level of organization—every level, fromnational governmentsdown to nurseries and honeymooning couples. For it isn't merely aquestion of making things hard for the Great Leaders. There are all themillions of small-scale tyrants and persecutors, all the mute ingloriousHitlers, the village Napoleons, the Calvins and Torquemadas of the family.Not to mention all the brigands and bullies stupid enough to get themselveslabeled as criminals. How does one harness the enormous power thesepeople generate and set it to work in some useful way—or at least preventit from doing harm?\"183\"That's what I want you to tell me,\" said Will. \"Where do you start?\"\"We start everywhere at once,\" Vijaya answered. \"But since one can't"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"say more than one thing at a time, let's begin by talking about the anatomyand physiology of power. Tell himabout your biochemical approach to thesubject, Dr. Robert.\"\"It started,\" said Dr. Robert, \"nearly forty years ago, while I wasstudying in London. Started with prison visiting on weekends and readinghistory whenever I had a free evening. History and prisons,\" he repeated. \"Idiscovered that they were closely related. The record of the crimes, folliesand misfortunes of mankind (that's Gibbon, isn't it?) and the place whereunsuccessful crimes and follies are visited with a special kind of misfortune.Reading my books and talking to my jailbirds, I found myself askingquestions. What kind of people became dangerous delinquents—the granddelinquents of the history books, the little ones of Pentonville andWormwood Scrubbs? What kinds of people are moved by the lust forpower, the passion to bully and domineer? And the ruthless ones, the menand women who know what they want and have no qualms about hurtingand killing in order to get it, the monsters who hurt and kill, not for profit, butgratuitously, because hurting and killing are such fun—who are they? Iused to discuss these questions with the experts—doctors, psychologists,social scientists, teachers. Man-tegazza and Galton had gone out offashion, and most of my experts assured me that the only valid answers tothese questions were answers in terms of culture, economics, and thefamily. It was all a matter of mothers and toilet training, of early conditioningand traumatic environments. I was only half convinced. Mothers and toilettraining and the circumambient nonsense—these were obviouslyimportant. But were they a//-important? In the course of my prison visitingI'd begun to see evidence of some kind of a built-in pattern—or rather oftwo kinds of built-184Islandin patterns; for dangerous delinquents and power-loving troublemakersdon't belong to a single species. Most of them, as I was beginning torealize even then, belong to one or other of two distinct and dissimilarspecies—the Muscle People and the Peter Pans. I've specialized in thetreatment of Peter Pans.\"\"The boys who never grow up?\" Will queried.\" 'Never' is the wrong word. In real life Peter Pan always ends bygrowing up. He merely grows up too late—grows up physiologically moreslowly than he grows up in terms of birthdays.\"\"What about girl Peter Pans?\""},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"\"They're very rare. But the boys are as common as blackberries. Youcan expect one Peter Pan among every five or six male children. Andamong problem children, among the boys who can't read, won't learn, don'tget on with anyone, and finally turn to the more violent forms ofdelinquency, seven out of ten turn out, if you take an X ray of the bones ofthe wrist, to be Peter Pans. The rest are mostly Muscle People of one sortor another.\"\"I'm trying to think,\" said Will, \"of a good historical example of adelinquent Peter Pan.\"\"You don't have to go far afield. The most recent, as well as the bestand biggest, was Adolf Hitler.\"\"Hitler?\" Murugan's tone was one of shocked astonishment. Hitler wasevidently one of his heroes.\"Read the Fiihrer's biography,\" said Dr. Robert. \"A Peter Pan if everthere was one. Hopeless at school. Incapable either of competing or co-operating. Envying all the normally successful boys—and, because heenvied, hating themand, to make himself feel better, despising themasinferior beings. Then came the time for puberty. But Adolf was sexuallybackward. Other boys made advances to girls, and the girls responded.Adolf was too shy, too uncertain of his manhood. And all the time incapableof steady work, at home only in the compensatory Other World of his fancy.There, at the very least, he was Michelangelo. Here,185unfortunately, he couldn't draw. His only gifts were hatred, low cunning, aset of indefatigable vocal cords and a talent for nonstop talking at the top ofhis voice fromthe depths of his Peter-Panic paranoia. Thirty or forty milliondeaths and heaven knows how many billions of dollars—that was the pricethe world had to pay for little Adolf's retarded maturation. Fortunately mostof the boys who grow up too slowly never get a chance of being more thanminor delinquents. But even minor delinquents, if there are enough of them,can exact a pretty stiff price. That's why we try to nip themin the bud—orrather, since we're dealing with Peter Pans, that's why we try to make theirnipped buds open out and grow.\"\"And do you succeed?\"Dr. Robert nodded. \"It isn't hard. Particularly if you start early enough.Between four and a half and five all our children get a thoroughexamination. Blood tests, psychological tests, somatotyping; then we X raytheir wrists and give them an EEC All the cute little Peter Pans are spotted"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"without fail, and appropriate treatment is started immediately. Within a yearpractically all of themare perfectly normal. A crop of potential failures andcriminals, potential tyrants and sadists, potential misanthropes andrevolutionaries for revolution's sake, has been transformed into a crop ofuseful citizens who can be governed adandena asatthena—withoutpunishment and without a sword. In your part of the world delinquency isstill left to clergymen, social workers and the police. Nonstop sermons andsupportive therapy; prison sentences galore. With what results? Thedelinquency rate goes steadily up and up. No wonder. Words about siblingrivalry and hell and the personality of Jesus are no substitutes forbiochemistry. A year in jail won't cure a Peter Pan of his endocrinedisbalance or help the ex-Peter Pan to get rid of his psychologicalconsequences. For Peter-Panic delinquency, what you need is earlydiagnosis and three pink capsules a day before meals. Given a tolerableenvironment, the result will be186Islandsweet reasonableness and a modicumof the cardinal virtues withineighteen months. Not to mention a fair chance, where before there hadn'tbeen the faintest possibility, of eventual praj-naparamita and karuna,eventual wisdomand compassion. And now get Vijaya to tell you about theMuscle People. As you may perhaps have observed, he's one of them.\"Leaning forward, Dr. Robert thumped the giant's broad back. \"Solid beef!\"And he added, \"How lucky for us poor shrimps that the animal isn'tsavage.\"Vijaya took one hand off the wheel, beat his chest and uttered a loudferocious roar. \"Don't tease the gorilla,\" he said, and laughed good-humoredly. Then, \"Think of the other great dictator,\" he said to Will, \"thinkof Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin. Hitler's the supreme example of thedelinquent Peter Pan. Stalin's the supreme example of the delinquentMuscle Man. Predestined, by his shape, to be an extravert. Not one of yoursoft, round, spill-the-beans extraverts who pine for indiscriminatetogetherness. No-—the trampling, driving extravert, the one who alwaysfeels impelled to Do Something and is never inhibited by doubts or qualms,by sympathy or sensibility. In his will, Lenin advised his successors to getrid of Stalin: the man was too fond of power and too apt to abuse it. But theadvice came too late. Stalin was already so firmly entrenched that hecouldn't be ousted. Ten years later his power was absolute. Trotsky hadbeen scotched; all his old friends had been bumped off. Now, like God"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"among the choiring angels, he was alone in a cozy little heaven peopledonly by flatterers and yes-men. And all the time he was ruthlessly busy,liquidating kulaks, organizing collectives, building an armament industry,shifting reluctant millions from farmto factory. Working with a tenacity, alucid efficiency of which the German Peter Pan, with his apocalypticphantasies and his fluctuating moods, was utterly incapable. And in the lastphase of the war, compare Stalin's strategy with Hitler's. Cool calculationpitted against compensatory daydreams, clear-eyed realism against187the rhetorical nonsense that Hitler had finally talked himself into believing.Two monsters, equal in delinquency, but profoundly dissimilar intemperament, in unconscious motivation, and finally in efficiency. PeterPans are wonderfully good at starting wars and revolutions; but it takesMuscle Men to carry themthrough to a successful conclusion. Here's thejungle,\" Vijaya added in another tone, waving a hand in the direction of agreat cliff of trees that seemed to block their further ascent.A moment later they had left the glare of the open hillside and hadplunged into a narrow tunnel of green twilight that zigzagged up betweenwalls of tropical foliage. Creepers dangled fromthe overarching branchesand between the trunks of huge trees grew ferns and dark-leavedrhododendrons with a dense profusion of shrubs and bushes that for Will,as he looked about him, were namelessly unfamiliar. The air was stiflinglydamp and there was a hot, acrid smell of luxuriant green growth and of thatother kind of life which is decay. Muffled by the thick foliage, Will heard theringing of distant axes, the rhythmic screech of a saw. The road turned yetonce more and suddenly the green darkness of the tunnel gave place tosunshine. They had entered a clearing in the forest. Tall and broad-shouldered, half a dozen almost naked woodcutters were engaged inlopping the branches froma newly felled tree. In the sunshine hundreds ofblue and amethyst butterflies chased one another, fluttering and soaring inan endless random dance. Over a fire at the further side of the clearing anold man was slowly stirring the contents of an iron caldron. Nearby a smalltame deer, fine-limbed and elegantly dappled, was quietly grazing.\"Old friends,\" said Vijaya, and shouted something in Palanese. Thewoodcutters shouted back and waved their hands. Then the road swungsharply to the left and they were climbing again up the green tunnelbetween the trees.\"Talk of Muscle Men,\" said Will as they left the clearing. \"Those were"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"really splendid specimens.\"188Island\"That kind of physique,\" said Vijaya, \"is a standing temptation. And yetamong all these men—and I've worked with scores of them—I've never meta single bully, a single potentially dangerous power lover.\"\"Which is just another way,\" Murugan broke in contemptuously, \"ofsaying that nobody here has any ambition.\"\"What's the explanation?\" Will asked.\"Very simple, so far as the Peter Pans are concerned. They're nevergiven a chance to work up an appetite for power. We cure them of theirdelinquency before it's had time to develop. But the Muscle Men aredifferent. They're just as muscular here, just as tramplingly extraverted, asthey are with you. So why don't they turn into Stalins or Dipas, or at theleast into domestic tyrants? First of all, our social arrangements offer themvery few opportunities for bullying their families, and our politicalarrangements make it practically impossible for them to domineer on anylarger scale. Second, we train the Muscle Men to be aware and sensitive,we teach themto enjoy the commonplaces of everyday existence. Thismeans that they always have an alternative—innumerable alternatives—tothe pleasure of being the boss. And finally we work directly on the love ofpower and domination that goes with this kind of physique in almost all itsvariations. We canalize this love of power and we deflect it—turn it awayfrompeople and on to things. We give themall kinds of difficult tasks toperform—strenuous and violent tasks that exercise their muscles andsatisfy their craving for domination—but satisfy it at nobody's expense andin ways that are either harmless or positively useful.\"\"So these splendid creatures fell trees instead of felling people—is thatit?\"\"Precisely. And when they've had enough of the woods, they can go tosea, or try their hands at mining, or take it easy, relatively speaking, on therice paddies.\"Will Farnaby suddenly laughed.189\"What's the joke?\"\"I was thinking of my father. A little woodchopping might have been themaking of him—not to mention the salvation of his wretched family."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Unfortunately he was an English gentleman. Woodchopping was out of thequestion.\"\"Didn't he have any physical outlet for his energies?\" Will shook hishead. \"Besides being a gentleman,\" he explained, \"my father thought hewas an intellectual. But an intellectual doesn't hunt or shoot or play golf; hejust thinks and drinks. Apart from brandy, my father's only amusementswere bullying, auction bridge, and the theory of politics. He fancied himselfas a twentietly century version of Lord Acton—the last, lonely philosopherof Liberalism. You should have heard himon the iniquities of the modernomnipotent state! 'Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.Absolutely.'' After which he'd down another brandy and go back withrenewed gusto to his favorite pastime—trampling on his wife and children.\"\"And if Acton himself didn't behave in that way,\" said Dr. Robert, \"itwas merely because he happened to be virtuous and intelligent. There wasnothing in his theories to restrain a delinquent Muscle Man or an untreatedPeter Pan from trampling on anyone he could get his feet on. That wasActon's fatal weakness. As a political theorist he was altogether admirable.As a practical psychologist he was almost nonexistent. He seems to havethought that the power problemcould be solved by good socialarrangements, supplemented, of course, by sound morality and a spot ofrevealed religion. But the power problemhas its roots in anatomy andbiochemistry and temperament. Power has to be curbed on the legal andpolitical levels; that's obvious. But it's also obvious that there must beprevention on the individual level. On the level of instinct and emotion, onthe level of the glands and the viscera, the muscles and the blood. If I canever find the time, I'd like to write a lit-190Islandtle book on human physiology in relation to ethics, religion, politics andlaw.\"\"Law,\" Will echoed. \"I was just going to ask you about law. Are youabsolutely swordless and punishmentless? Or do you still need judges andpolicemen?\"\"We still need them,\" said Dr. Robert. \"But we don't need nearly somany of themas you do. In the first place, thanks to preventive medicineand preventive education, we don't commit many crimes. And in thesecond place, most of the few crimes that are committed are dealt with bythe criminal's MAC. Group therapy within a community that has assumedgroup responsibility for the delinquent. And in difficult cases the group"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"therapy is supplemented by medical treatment and a course of moksha-medicme experiences, directed by somebody with an exceptional degree ofinsight.\"\"So where do the judges come in?\"\"The judge listens to the evidence, decides whether the accusedperson is innocent or guilty, and if he's guilty, remands him to his MAC and,where it seems advisable, to the local panel of medical and mycomysticalexperts. At stated intervals the experts and the MAC report back to thejudge. When the reports are satisfactory, the case is closed.\"\"And if they're never satisfactory?\"\"In the long run,\" said Dr. Robert, \"they always are.\"There was a silence.\"Did you ever do any rock climbing?\" Vijaya suddenly asked.Will laughed. \"How do you think I came by my game leg?\"\"That was forced climbing. Did you ever climb for fun?\"\"Enough,\" said Will, \"to convince me that I wasn't much good at it.\"Vijaya glanced at Murugan. \"What about you, while you were inSwitzerland?\"The boy blushed deeply and shook his head. \"You can't do any ofthose things,\" he muttered, \"if you have a tendency to TB.\"191\"What a pity!\" said Vijaya. \"It would have been so good for you.\"Will asked, \"Do people do a lot of climbing in these mountains?\"\"Climbing's an integral part of the school curriculum.\"\"For everybody?\"\"A little for everybody. With more advanced rock work for the full-blownMuscle People—that's about one in twelve of the boys and one in twenty-seven of the girls. We shall soon be seeing some youngsters tackling theirfirst post-elementary climb.\"The green tunnel widened, brightened, and suddenly they were out ofthe dripping forest on a wide shelf of almost level ground, walled in on threesides by red rocks that towered up two thousand feet and more into asuccession of jagged crests and isolated pinnacles. There was a freshnessin the air and, as they passed from sunshine into the shadow of a floatingisland of cumulus, it was almost cool. Dr. Robert leaned forward andpointed, through the windshield, at a group of white buildings on a littleknoll near the center of the plateau.\"That's the High Altitude Station,\" he said. \"Seven thousand feet up,"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"with more than five thousand acres of good flat land, where we can growpractically anything that grows in southern Europe. Wheat and barley;green peas and cabbages, lettuce and tomatoes (the fruit won't set wherenight temperatures are over sixty-eight); gooseberries, strawberries,walnuts, greengages, peaches, apricots. Plus all the valuable plants thatare native to high mountains at this latitude—including the mushrooms thatour young friend here so violently disapproves of.\"\"Is this the place we're bound for?\" Will asked.\"No, we're going higher.\" Dr. Robert pointed to the last outpost of therange, a ridge of dark-red rock fromwhich the land sloped down on oneside to the jungle and on the other mounted precipitously towards anunseen summit lost in the192Islandclouds. \"Up to the old Shiva temple where the pilgrims used to come everyspring and autumn equinox. It's one of my favorite places in the wholeisland. When the children were small, we used to go up there for picnics,Lakshmi and I, almost every week. How many years ago!\" A note ofsadness had come into his voice. He sighed and, leaning back in his seat,closed his eyes.They turned off the road that led to the High Altitude Station and beganto climb again.\"Entering the last, worst lap,\" said Vijaya. \"Seven hairpin turns and halfa mile of unventilated tunnel.\"He shifted into first gear and conversation became impossible. Tenminutes later they had arrived.193Cautiously maneuvering his immobilized leg, Will climbed out of thecar and looked about him. Between the red soaring crags to the south andthe headlong descents in every other direction the crest of the ridge hadbeen leveled, and at the midpoint of this long narrow terrace stood thetemple—a great red tower of the same substance as the mountains,massive, four-sided, vertically ribbed. A thing of symmetry in contrast withthe rocks, but regular not as Euclidean abstractions are regular; regularwith the pragmatic geometry of a living thing. Yes, of a living thing; for allthe temple's richly textured surfaces, all its bounding contours against thesky curved organically inwards, narrowing as they mounted towards a ring"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"of marble, above which the red stone swelled out again, like the seedcapsule of a flowering plant, into a flattened, many-ribbed dome thatcrowned the whole.\"Built about fifty years before the Norman Conquest,\" said Dr. Robert.\"And looks,\" Will commented, \"as though it hadn't been built byanybody—as though it had grown out of the rock.194IslandGrown like the bud of an agave, on the point of rocketing up into atwelve-foot stalk and an explosion of flowers.\"Vijaya touched his arm. \"Look,\" he said. \"A party of Ele-mentariescoming down.\"Will turned towards the mountain and saw a young man in nailed bootsand climbing clothes working his way down a chimney in the face of theprecipice. At a place where the chimney offered a convenient resting placehe halted and, throwing back his head, gave utterance to a loud Alpineyodel. Fifty feet above him a boy came out from behind a buttress of rock,lowered himself from the ledge on which he was standing and started downthe chimney.\"Does it tempt you?\" Vijaya asked, turning to Murugan.Heavily overacting the part of the bored, sophisticated adult who hassomething better to do than watch the children at play, Murugan shruggedhis shoulders. \"Not in the slightest.\" He moved away and, sitting down onthe weatherworn carving of a lion, pulled a gaudily bound Americanmagazine out of his pocket and started to read.\"What's the literature?\" Vijaya asked.''Science Fiction.\" There was a ring of defiance in Murugan'svoice.Dr. Robert laughed. \"Anything to escape from Fact.\"Pretending not to have heard him, Murugan turned a page and wenton reading.\"He's pretty good,\" said Vijaya, who had been watching the youngclimber's progress. \"They have an experienced man at each end of therope,\" he added. \"You can't see the number-one man. He's behind thatbuttress in a parallel chimney thirty or forty feet higher up. There's apermanent iron spike up there, where you can belay the rope. The wholeparty could fall, and they'd be perfectly safe.\"Spread-eagled between footholds in either wall of the narrow chimney,the leader kept shouting up instructions and encour-"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"195agement. Then, as the boy approached, he yielded his place, climbeddown another twenty feet and, halting, yodeled again. Booted andtrousered, a tall girl with her hair in pigtails appeared frombehind thebuttress and lowered herself into the chimney.\"Excellent!\" said Vijaya approvingly as he watched her.Meanwhile, froma low building at the foot of the cliff—the tropicalversion, evidently, of an Alpine hut—a group of young people had come outto see what was happening. They belonged, Will was told, to three otherparties of climbers who had taken their Postelementary Test earlier in theday.\"Does the best teamwin a prize?\" Will asked.\"Nobody wins anything,\" Vijaya answered. \"This isn't a competition. It'smore like an ordeal.\"\"An ordeal,\" Dr. Robert explained, \"which is the first stage of theirinitiation out of childhood into adolescence. An ordeal that helps them tounderstand the world they'll have to live in, helps them to realize theomnipresence of death, the essential precariousness of all existence. Butafter the ordeal comes the revelation. In a few minutes these boys and girlswill be given their first experience of the moksha-medicinc. They'll all take ittogether, and there'll be a religious ceremony in the temple.\"\"Something like the Confirmation Service?\"\"Except that this is more than just a piece of theological rigmarole.Thanks to the moksha-medicinc, it includes an actual experience of the realthing.\"\"The real thing?\" Will shook his head. \"Is there such a thing? I wish Icould believe it.\"\"You're not being asked to believe it,\" said Dr. Robert. \"The real thingisn't a proposition; it's a state of being. We don't teach our children creedsor get themworked up over emotionally charged symbols. When it's timefor them to learn the deepest truths of religion, we set them to climb aprecipice and then give themfour hundred milligrams of revelation.

It works. First and last I've climbed my way out of literally scores ofthe ugliest temptations to throw my weight around—and my weight beingconsiderable,\" he added, \"incitements were correspondingly strong.\"\"There seems to be only one catch,\" said Will. \"In the process ofclimbing your way out of temptation, you might fall and ...\" Suddenlyremembering what had happened to Dugald MacPhail, he broke off.It was Dr. Robert who finished the sentence. \"Might fall,\" he saidslowly, \"and kill yourself. Dugald was climbing alone,\" he went on after alittle pause. \"Nobody knows what happened. The body wasn't found till thenext day.\" There was a longsilence.\"Do you still think this is a good idea?\" Will asked, pointing with hisbamboo staff at the tiny figures crawling so laboriously on the face of thatheadlong wilderness of naked rock.\"I still think it's a good idea,\" said Dr. Robert.\"But poor Susila___\"\"Yes, poor Susila,\" Dr. Robert repeated. \"And poor children, poorLakshmi, poor me.

And now,\" he continued in another tone, \"I want to show you theview.\"\"And I'll go and talk to those boys and girls.\" Vijaya walked awaytowards the group at the foot of the red crags.Leaving Murugan to his Science Fiction, Will followed Dr. Robertthrough a pillared gateway and across the wide stone platform thatsurrounded the temple. At one corner of this platformstood a small domedpavilion. They entered and, crossing to the wide unglazed window, looked"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"out. Rising to the line of the horizon, like a solid wall of jade and lapis, wasthe sea. Below them, after a sheer fall of a thousand feet, lay the green ofthe jungle. Beyond the jungle, folded vertically into combe and buttress,terraced horizontally into a huge man-made staircase of innumerable fields,the lower slopes went steeply down into a wide plain, at whose furthestverge, between the market gardens and the palm-fringed beach, stretcheda considerable city. Seen fromthis high vantage point in its shiningcompleteness, it looked like the tiny, meticulous painting of a city in amedieval book of hours.\"There's Shivapuram,\" said Dr. Robert. \"And that complex of buildingson the hill beyond the river—that's the great Buddhist temple. A little earlierthan Borobudur, and the sculpture is as fine as anything in Further India.\"There was a silence. \"This little summerhouse,\" he resumed, \"is where weused to eat our picnics when it was raining. I shall never forget the timewhen Dugald (he must have been about ten) amused himself by climbingup here on the window ledge and standing on one leg in the attitude of thedancing Shiva. Poor Lakshmi, she was scared out of her wits. But Dugaldwas a born steeplejack. Which only makes the accident even moreincomprehensible.\" He shook his head; then, after another silence, \"Thelast time we all came up here,\" he said, \"was eight or nine months ago.Dugald was still alive and Lakshmi wasn't yet too weak for a198Island199day's outing with her grandchildren. He did that Shiva stunt again for thebenefit of TomKrishna and Mary Sarojini. On one leg; and he kept his armsmoving so fast that one could have sworn there were four of them.\" Dr.Robert broke off. Picking up a flake of mortar fromthe floor, he tossed it outof the window. \"Down, down, down . . . Empty space. Pascal avait songouffre. How strange that this should be at once the most powerful symbolof death and the most powerful symbol of the fullest, intensest life.\"Suddenly his face lighted up. \"Do you see that hawk?\"\"A hawk?\"Dr. Robert pointed to where, halfway between their eyrie and the darkroof of the forest, a small brown incarnation of speed and rapine lazilywheeled on unmoving wings. \"It reminds me of a poem that the Old Rajaonce wrote about this place.\" Dr. Robert was silent for a moment, thenstarted to recite:"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"\"Up here, you ask me, Up here aloft where Shiva Dances above theworld, What the devil do I think I'mdoing?No answer, friend—exceptThat hawk below us turning,Those black and arrowy swiftsTrailing long silver wires across the air—The shrillness of their crying.How far, you say, from the hot plains, How far, reproachfully, fromallmy people! And yet how close!

Which reminds me . . .\" He looked at hiswatch.\"What's next on the program?\" Will asked as they stepped out into theglare.\"The service in the temple,\" Dr. Robert answered. \"The young climberswill offer their accomplishment to Shiva—in other words, to their ownSuchness visualized as God. After which they'll go on to the second part oftheir initiation—the experience of being liberated from themselves.\"\"By means of the moksha-medicine?\"Dr. Robert nodded. \"Their leaders give it them before they leave theClimbing Association's hut. Then they come over to the temple. The stuffstarts working during the service. Incidentally,\" he added, \"the service is inSanskrit, so you won't understand a word of it. Vijaya's address will be inEnglish—he speaks in his capacity as president of the ClimbingAssociation. So will mine. And of course the young people will mostly talk inEnglish.\"Inside the temple there was a cool, cavernous darkness, temperedonly by the faint daylight filtering in through a pair of small latticed windowsand by the seven lamps that hung, like a halo of yellow, quivering stars,above the head of the image on the altar. It was a copper statue, no tallerthan a child, of Shiva. Surrounded by a flame-fringed glory, his four armsgesturing, his braided hair wildly flying, his right foot treading down adwarfish figure of the most hideous malignity, his left foot gracefully lifted,the god stood there, frozen in mid-ecstasy. No longer in their climbingdress, but sandaled, bare-breasted and in shorts or brightly colored skirts,a score of boys and girls, together with the six young men who had actedas their leaders and instructors, were sitting cross-legged on the floor.Above them, on the highest of the altar steps, an old priest, shaven and"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"yellow-robed,200Islandwas intoning something sonorous and incomprehensible. Leaving Willinstalled on a convenient ledge, Dr. Robert tiptoed over to where Vijayaand Murugan were sitting and squatted down beside them.The splendid rumble of Sanskrit gave place to a high nasal chant, andthe chanting in due course was succeeded by a litany, priestly utterancealternating with congregational response.And now incense was burned in a bass thurible. The old priest held uphis two hands for silence, and through a long pregnant time of the mostperfect stillness the thread of gray incense smoke rose straight andunwavering before the god, then as it met the draft from the windows brokeand was lost to view in an invisible cloud that filled the whole dimspacewith the mysterious fragrance of another world. Will opened his eyes andsaw that, alone of all the congregation, Murugan was restlessly fidgeting.And not merely fidgeting—making faces of impatient disapproval. Hehimself had never climbed; therefore climbing was merely silly. He himselfhad always refused to try the moksha-medicine; therefore those who usedit were beyond the pale. His mother believed in the Ascended Masters andchatted regularly with Koot Hoomi; therefore the image of Shiva was avulgar idol. What an eloquent pantomime, Will thought as he watched theboy. But alas for poor little Murugan, nobody was paying the slightestattention to his antics.\"Shivayanama,\" said the old priest, breaking the long silence, andagain, \"Shivayanama.\" He made a beckoning gesture.Rising fromher place, the tall girl whom Will had seen working her waydown the precipice mounted the altar steps. Standing on tiptoe, her oiledbody gleaming like a second copper statue in the light of the lamps, shehung a garland of pale-yellow flowers on the uppermost of Shiva's two leftarms. Then, laying palmto palm, she looked up into the god's serenelysmiling face and, in a voice that faltered at first, but gradually grew steadier,began to speak:201\"O you the creator, you the destroyer, you who sustainand make an end, Who in sunlight dance among the birds and the childrenat their play, Who at midnight dance among corpses in the burning"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"grounds,You Shiva, you dark and terrible Bhairava, You Suchness and Illusion,the Void and All Things, You are the lord of life, and therefore I havebrought youflowers; You are the lord of death, and therefore I have broughtyou my heart—This heart that is now your burning ground. Ignorance there and selfshall be consumed with fire. That you may dance, Bhairava, among theashes. That you may dance, Lord Shiva, in a place of flowers, And I dancewith you.\"Raising her arms, the girl made a gesture that hinted at the ecstaticdevotion of a hundred generations of dancing worshipers, then turned awayand walked back into the twilight. \"Shivayanama,\" somebody cried out.Murugan snorted contemptuously as the refrain was taken up by otheryoung voices. \"Shivayanama, Shivayanama...\" The old priest started tointone another passage from the Scripture. Halfway through his recitation asmall gray bird with a crimson head flew in through one of the latticedwindows, fluttered wildly around the altar lamps, then, chattering in loudindignant terror, darted out again. The chanting continued, swelled to aclimax, and ended in the whispered prayer for peace: Shanti shanti shanti.The old priest now turned towards the altar, picked up a long taper and,borrowing flame fromone of the lamps above Shiva's head, proceeded tolight seven other lamps that hung within a deep niche beneath the slab onwhich the dancer stood. Glinting on pol-202Islandished convexities of metal, their light revealed another statue—this time ofShiva and Parvati, of the Arch-Yogin seated and, while two of his fourhands held aloft the symbolic drumand fire, caressing with the second pairthe amorous Goddess, with her twining legs and arms, by whom, in thiseternal embrace of bronze, he was bestridden. The old priest waved hishand. This time it was a boy, dark-skinned and powerfully muscled, whostepped into the light. Bending down, he hung the garland he was carryingabout Parvati's neck; then, twisting the long flower chain, dropped a secondloop of white orchids over Shiva's head.\"Each is both,\" he said.\"Each is both,\" the chorus of young voices repeated.Murugan violently shook his head.\"O you who are gone,\" said the dark-skinned boy, \"who are gone, who"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"are gone to the other shore, who have landed on the other shore, O youenlightenment and you other enlightenment, you liberation made one withliberation, you compassion in the arms of infinite compassion.\"\"Shivayanama.\"He went back to his place. There was a long silence. Then Vijaya roseto his feet and began to speak.\"Danger,\" he said, and again, \"danger. Danger deliberately and yetlightly accepted. Danger shared with a friend, a group of friends. Sharedconsciously, shared to the limits of awareness so that the sharing and thedanger become a yoga. Two friends roped together on a rock face.Sometimes three friends or four. Each totally aware of his own strainingmuscles, his own skill, his own fear, and his own spirit transcending thefear. And each, of course, aware at the same time of all the others,concerned for them, doing the right things to make sure that they'll be safe.Life at its highest pitch of bodily and mental tension, life more abundant,more inestimably precious, because of the ever-present threat of death. Butafter the yoga of danger there's the yoga of the summit, the yoga of restand letting go, the yoga of203complete and total receptiveness, the yoga that consists in consciouslyaccepting what is given as it is given, without censorship by your busymoralistic mind, without any additions from your stock of secondhandideals, your even larger stock of wishful phantasies. You just sit there withmuscles relaxed and a mind open to the sunlight and the clouds, open todistance and the horizon, open in the end to that formless, wordless Not-Thought which the stillness of the summit permits you to divine, profoundand enduring, within the twittering flux of your everyday thinking.\"And now it's time for the descent, time for a second bout of the yogaof danger, time for a renewal of tension and the awareness of life in itsglowing plenitude as you hang precariously on the brink of destruction.Then at the foot of the precipice you unrope, you go striding down the rockypath toward the first trees. And suddenly you're in the forest, and anotherkind of yoga is called for—the yoga of the jungle, the yoga that consists ofbeing totally aware of life at the near-point, jungle life in all its exuberanceand its rotting, crawling squalor, all its melodramatic ambivalence of orchidsand centipedes, of leeches and sunbirds, of the drinkers of nectar and thedrinkers of blood.

Beauty and horror, beauty,\" herepeated, \"and horror. And then suddenly, as you come down from one ofyour expeditions in the mountains, suddenly you know that there's areconciliation. And not merely a reconciliation. A fusion, an identity. Beautymade one with horror in the yoga of the jungle. Life reconciled with theperpetual imminence of death in the yoga of danger. Emptiness identifiedwith selfhood in the Sabbath yoga of the summit.\"There was silence. Murugan yawned ostentatiously. The old priestlighted another stick of incense and, muttering, waved it before the dancer,waved it again around the cosmic love-making of Shiva and the Goddess.204Island\"Breathe deeply,\" said Vijaya, \"and as you breathe pay attention to thissmell of incense. Pay your whole attention to it; know it for what it is—anineffable fact beyond words, beyond reason and explanation. Know it in theraw. Know it as a mystery. Perfume, women and prayer—those were thethree things that Mohammed loved above all others. The inexplicable dataof breathed incense, touched skin, felt love and beyond them, the mysteryof mysteries, the One in plurality, the Emptiness that is all, the Suchnesstotally present in every appearance, at every point and instant. So breathe,\"he repeated, \"breathe,\" and in a final whisper, as he sat down, \"breathe.\"\"Shivayanama,\" murmured the old priest ecstatically.Dr. Robert rose and started towards the altar, then halted, turned back,and beckoned to Will Farnaby.\"Come and sit with me,\" he whispered, when Will had caught up withhim. \"I'd like you to see their faces.\"\"Shan't I be in the way?\"Dr. Robert shook his head, and together they moved forward, climbedand, three quarters of the way up the altar stair, sat down side by side inthe penumbra between darkness and the light of the lamps. Very quietly Dr.Robert began to talk about Shiva-Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance.\"Look at his image,\" he said. \"Look at it with these new eyes that themoksha-medicine has given you. See how it breathes and pulses, how itgrows out of brightness into brightness ever more intense. Dancing throughtime and out of time, dancing everlastingly and in the eternal now. Dancingand dancing in all the worlds at once. Look at him.\"Scanning those upturned faces, Will noted, now in one, now inanother, the dawning illuminations of delight, recognition, understanding,the signs of worshiping wonder that quivered on the brinks of ecstasy or"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"terror.\"Lookclosely,\"Dr.Robert insisted.\"Look still more205closely.\" Then, after a long minute of silence, \"Dancing in all the worlds atonce,\" he repeated. \"In all the worlds. And first of all in the world of matter.Look at the great round halo, fringed with the symbols of fire, within whichthe god is dancing. It stands for Nature, for the world of mass and energy.Within it Shiva-Nataraja dances the dance of endless becoming andpassing away. It's his lila, his cosmic play. Playing for the sake of playing,like a child. But this child is the Order of Things. His toys are galaxies, hisplayground is infinite space and between finger and finger every interval isa thousand million light-years. Look at himthere on the altar. The image isman-made, a little contraption of copper only four feet high. But Shiva-Nataraja fills the universe, is the universe. Shut your eyes and see himtowering into the night, follow the boundless stretch of those arms and thewild hair infinitely flying.\"Nataraja at play among the stars and in the atoms. But also,\" headded, \"also at play within every living thing, every sentient creature, everychild and man and woman. Play for play's sake. But now the playground isconscious, the dance floor is capable of suffering. To us, this play withoutpurpose seems a kind of insult. What we would really like is a God whonever destroys what he has created. Or if there must be pain and death, letthembe meted out by a God of righteousness, who will punish the wickedand reward the good with everlasting happiness. But in fact the good gethurt, the innocent suffer. Then let there be a God who sympathizes andbrings comfort. But Nataraja only dances. His play is a play impartially ofdeath and of life, of all evils as well as of all goods. In the uppermost of hisright hands he holds the drumthat summons being out of not-being. Rub-a-dub-dub—the creation tattoo, the cosmic reveille. But now look at theuppermost of his left hands. It brandishes the fire by which all that has beencreated is forthwith destroyed. He dances this way-—what happiness!Dances that way—and oh, the pain,206Islandthe hideous fear, the desolation! Then hop, skip and jump. Hop into perfecthealth. Skip into cancer and senility. Jump out of the fullness of life intonothingness, out of nothingness again into life. For Nataraja it's all play,"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"and the play is an end in itself, everlastingly purposeless. He dancesbecause he dances, and the dancing is his maha-sukha, his infinite andeternal bliss. Eternal bliss,\" Dr. Robert repeated and again, butquestioningly, \"Eternal bliss?\" He shook his head. \"For us there's no bliss,only the oscillation between happiness and terror and a sense of outrage atthe thought that our pains are as integral a part of Nataraja's dance as ourpleasures, our dying as our living. Let's quietly think about that for a littlewhile.\"The seconds passed, the silence deepened. Suddenly, star-tlingly, oneof the girls began to sob. Vijaya left his place and, kneeling down besideher, laid a hand on her shoulder. The sobbing died down.\"Suffering and sickness,\" Dr. Robert resumed at last, \"old age,decrepitude, death. I show you sorrow. But that wasn't the only thing theBuddha showed us. He also showed us the ending of sorrow.\"\"Shivayanama,\" the old priest cried triumphantly.\"Open your eyes again and look at Nataraja up there on the altar. Lookclosely. In his upper right hand, as you've already seen, he holds the drumthat calls the world into existence and in his upper left hand he carries thedestroying fire. Life and death, order and disintegration, impartially. Butnow look at Shiva's other pair of hands. The lower right hand is raised andthe palmis turned outwards. What does that gesture signify? It signifies,'Don't be afraid; it's All Right.' But how can anyone in his senses fail to beafraid? How can anyone pretend that evil and suffering are all right, whenit's so obvious that they're all wrong? Nataraja has the answer. Look now athis lower left hand. He's using it to point down at his feet. And what are hisfeet doing? Look closely207and you'll see that the right foot is planted squarely on a horrible littlesubhuman creature—the demon, Muyalaka. A dwarf, but immenselypowerful in his malignity, Muyalaka is the embodiment of ignorance, themanifestation of greedy, possessive selfhood. Stamp on him, break hisback! And that's precisely what Nataraja is doing. Trampling the littlemonster down under his right foot. But notice that it isn't at this tramplingright foot that he points his finger; it's at the left foot, the foot that, as hedances, he's in the act of raising from the ground. And why does he point atit? Why? That lifted foot, that dancing defiance of the force of gravity—it'sthe symbol of release, of moksha, of liberation. Nataraja dances in all theworlds at once—in the world of physics and chemistry, in the world of"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"ordinary, all-too-human, experience, in the world finally of Suchness, ofMind, of the Clear Light. . . .

And now shutyour eyes and see themagain—shining, alive, glorified. How beautiful! Andin their tenderness what depths of meaning! What wisdom beyond allspoken wisdoms in that sensual experience of spiritual fusion andatonement! Eternity in love with time. The One joined in marriage to themany, the relative made absolute by its union with the One. Nirvanaidentified with samsara, the manifestation in time and flesh and feeling ofthe Buddha Nature.\"\"Shivayanctma\" The old priest lighted another stick of incense andsoftly, in a succession of long-drawn melismata, began to chant somethingin Sanskrit. On the young faces before him Will could read the marks of alistening serenity, the hardly perceptible, ecstatic smile that welcomes asudden insight, a revelation of truth or of beauty. In the background,meanwhile, Murugan sat wearily slumped against a pillar, picking hisexquisitely Grecian nose.208Island\"Liberation,\" Dr. Robert began again, \"the ending of sorrow, ceasing tobe what you ignorantly think you are and becoming what you are in fact.For a little while, thanks to the moksha-medicine, you will know what it's liketo be what in fact you are, what in fact you always have been. What atimeless bliss! But, like everything else, this timelessness is transient. Likeeverything else, it will pass. And when it has passed, what will you do withthis experience? What will you do with all the other similar experiences thatthe moksha-medicine will bring you in the years to come? Will you merelyenjoy themas you would enjoy an evening at the puppet show, and then goback to business as usual, back to behaving like the silly delinquents youimagine yourselves to be? Or, having glimpsed, will you devote your livesto the business, not at all as usual, of being what you are in fact? All thatwe older people can do with our teachings, all that Pala can do for you withits social arrangements, is to provide you with techniques andopportunities. And all that the moksha-medicine can do is to give you asuccession of beatific glimpses, an hour or two, every now and then, ofenlightening and liberating grace.

At the footof the altar steps the boys and girls sat motionless as statues. A doorcreaked, there was a sound of footsteps. Will turned his head and saw ashort, thickset man picking his way between the young contemplatives. Hemounted the steps and, bending down, murmured something in Dr.Robert's ear, then turned and walked back towards the door.Dr. Robert laid a hand on Will's knee. \"It's a royal com-209mand,\" he whispered, with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders. \"That wasthe man in charge of the Alpine hut. The Rani has just telephoned to saythat she has to see Murugan as soon as possible.

All we can dois to learn the art of being irrational in a reasonable way.In Pala, after three generations of Reform, there are no sheeplikeflocks and no ecclesiastical Good Shepherds to shear and castrate; thereare no bovine or swinish herds and no licensed drovers, royal or military,capitalistic or revolutionary, to brand, confine and butcher. There are onlyvoluntary associations of men and women on the road to full humanity.Tunes or pebbles, processes or substantial things? \"Tunes,\" answerBuddhismand modern science. \"Pebbles,\" say the classical philosophersof the West. Buddhism and modern science think of the world in terms ofmusic. The image that comes to mind when one reads the philosophers ofthe West is a figure in a Byzantine mosaic, rigid, symmetrical, made up ofmillions of little squares of some stony material and firmly cemented to thewalls of a windowless basilica.The dancer's grace and, forty years on, her arthritis—both arefunctions of the skeleton.

Thething in whose absence we cannot possibly grow into a complete humanbeing is, all too often, the thing that prevents us fromgrowing.212IslandA century of research on the moksha-medicine has clearly shown thatquite ordinary people are perfectly capable of having visionary or even fullyliberating experiences. In this respect the men and women who make andenjoy high culture are no better off than the lowbrows. High experience isperfectly compatible with low symbolic expression.The expressive symbols created by Palanese artists are no better thanthe expressive symbols created by artists elsewhere.

It is not to be judged by the accomplishments of a fewgifted manipulators of artistic or philosophical symbols.

Should he let it ring or would itbe better to answer and let the caller know that Dr. Robert was out for theday? Deciding on the second course, Will lifted the receiver.\"Dr. MacPhail's bungalow,\" he said, in a parody of secretarialefficiency. \"But the doctor is out for the day.\"213\" Tant mieux\" said the rich royal voice at the other end of the wire.\"How are you, mon cher Farnaby?\"Taken aback, Will stammered out his thanks for Her Highness'gracious enquiry.\"So they took you,\" said the Rani, \"to see one of their so-calledinitiations yesterday afternoon.\"Will had recovered sufficiently fromhis surprise to respond with aneutral word and in the most noncommittal of tones. \"It was mostremarkable,\" he said.\"Remarkable,\" said the Rani, dwelling emphatically on the spokenequivalents of pejorative and laudatory capital letters, \"but only as theBlasphemous Caricature of true Initiation.

From Bahu shehad learned that Will had already written to Lord Aldehyde, and within a fewdays a reply would doubtless be forthcoming.

But in fact, as he was now flabbergasted to learn, it was in the yogaof love that this devoted settlement worker had been, for the past six yearsand in the intervals of librarian-ship, instructing the young. By the kinds ofmethods, Will supposed, that Murugan had shrunk fromand the Rani, inher all but incestuous possessiveness, had found so outrageous. Heopened his mouth to question her. But his reflexes had been conditioned inhigher latitude and by settlement workers of another species. Thequestions simply refused to pass his lips. And now it was too late to askthem.

Spiders can't help making flytraps, and men can't help makingsymbols. That's what the human brain is there for—to turn the chaos ofgiven experience into a set of manageable symbols. Sometimes thesymbols correspond fairly closely to some of the aspects of the externalreality behind our experience; then you have science and common sense.Sometimes, on the contrary, the symbols have almost no connection withexternal reality; then you have paranoia and delirium. More often there's amixture, part realistic and part fantastic; that's religion. Good religion or badreligion—it depends on the blending of the cocktail.

In other casesthe mixture is more wholesome. Fifty-fifty, or even sixty-forty, even seventy-thirty in favor of truth and decency. Our local Old-Fashioned contains aremarkably small admixture of poison.\"Will nodded. \"Offerings of white orchids to an image of compassionand enlightenment—it certainly seems harmless enough. And after what Isaw yesterday, I'd be prepared to put in a good word for cosmic dancingand divine copulation.\"\"And remember,\" said Vijaya, \"this sort of thing isn't compulsory.Everybody's given a chance to go further. You asked what that child thinksshe's doing. I'll tell you. With one part of her mind, she thinks she's talkingto a person—an enormous, divine person who can be cajoled with orchidsinto giving her what she wants. But she's already old enough to have beentold about the profounder symbols behind Amitabha's statue and about theexperiences that give birth to those profounder symbols. Consequently withanother part of her mind she knows perfectly well that Amitabha isn't a"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"person. She even knows,221because it's been explained to her, that if prayers are sometimes answeredit's because, in this very odd psychophysical world of ours, ideas have atendency, if you concentrate your mind on them, to get themselvesrealized. She knows too that this temple isn't what she still likes to think itis—the house of Buddha. She knows it's just a diagramof her ownunconscious mind—a dark little cubbyhole with lizards crawling upsidedown on the ceiling and cockroaches in all the crevices. But at the heart ofthe verminous darkness sits Enlightenment. And that's another thing thechild is doing—she's unconsciously learning a lesson about herself, she'sbeing told that if she'd only stop giving herself suggestions to the contrary,she might discover that her own busy little mind is also Mind with a largeM.\"\"And how soon will the lesson be learned? When will she stop givingherself those suggestions?\"\"She may never learn. A lot of people don't. On the other hand, a lot ofpeople do.\"He took Will's armand led himinto the deeper darkness behind theimage of Enlightenment. The chanting grew more distinct, and there,hardly visible in theshadows, sat the chanter—a very old man, naked tothe waist and, except for his moving lips, as rigidly still as Amitabha'sgolden statue. \"What's he intoning?\" Will asked. \"Something in Sanskrit.\"Seven incomprehensible syllables, again and again. \"Good old vainrepetition!\"\"Not necessarily vain,\" Mrs. Rao objected. \"Sometimes it really getsyou somewhere.\"\"It gets you somewhere,\" Vijaya elaborated, \"not because of what thewords mean or suggest, but simply because they're being repeated. Youcould repeat Hey Diddle Diddle and it would work just as well as OmorKyrie Eleison or La ila ilia 'llah. It works because when you're busy with therepetition of Hey Diddle Diddle or the name of God, you can't be entirely222Islandpreoccupied with yourself. The only trouble is that you can hey-diddle-diddle yourself downwards as well as upwards—down into the not-thoughtof idiocy as well as up into the not-thought of pure awareness.\""},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"\"So, I take it, you wouldn't recommend this kind of thing,\" said Will, \"toour little friend with the orchids?\"\"Not unless she were unusually jittery or anxious. Which she isn't. Iknow her very well; she plays with my children.\"\"Then what would you do in her case?\"\"Among other things,\" said Vijaya, \"I'd take her, in another year or so,to the place we're going to now.\"\"What place?\"\"The meditation room.\"Will followed him through an archway and along a short corridor.Heavy curtains were parted and they stepped into a large whitewashedroomwith a long window, to their left, that opened onto a little gardenplanted with banana and breadfruit trees. There was no furniture, only ascattering on the floor of small square cushions. On the wall opposite thewindow hung a large oil painting. Will gave it a glance, then approached tolook into it more closely.\"My word!\" he said at last. \"Who is it by?\"\"Gobind Singh.\"\"And who's Gobind Singh?\"\"The best landscape painter Pala ever produced. He died in 'forty-eight.\"\"Why haven't we ever seen anything by him?\"\"Because we like his work too well to export any of it.\"\"Good for you,\" said Will. \"But bad for us.\" He looked again at thepicture. \"Did this man ever go to China?\"\"No; but he studied with a Cantonese painter who was living in Pala.And of course he'd seen plenty of reproductions of Sung landscapes.\"223\"A Sung master,\" said Will, \"who chose to paint in oils and wasinterested in chiaroscuro.\"\"Only after he went to Paris. That was in 1910. He struck up afriendship with Vuillard.\"Will nodded. \"One might have guessed as much from thisextraordinary richness of texture.\" He went on looking at the picture insilence. \"Why do you hang it in the meditation room?\" he asked at last.\"Why do you suppose?\" Vijaya countered.\"Is it because this thing is what you call a diagramof the mind?\"\"The temple was a diagram. This is something much better. It's an"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"actual manifestation. A manifestation of Mind with a large Min an individualmind in relation to a landscape, to canvas and to the experience ofpainting. It's a picture, incidentally, of the next valley to the west. Paintedfromthe place where the power lines disappear over the ridge.\"\"What clouds!\" said Will. \"And the light!\"\"The light,\" Vijaya elaborated, \"of the last hour before dusk. It's juststopped raining and the sun has come out again, brighter than ever. Brightwith the preternatural brightness of slanting light under a ceiling of cloud,the last, doomed, afternoon brightness that stipples every surface ittouches and deepens every shadow.\"\"Deepens every shadow,\" Will repeated to himself, as he looked intothe picture. The shadow of that huge, high continent of cloud, darkeningwhole mountain ranges almost to blackness; and in the middle distance theshadows of island clouds. And between dark and dark was the blaze ofyoung rice, or the red heat of plowed earth, the incandescence of nakedlimestone, the sumptuous darks and diamond glitter of evergreen foliage.And here at the center of the valley stood a group of thatched houses,remote and tiny, but how clearly seen, how224Islandperfect and articulate, how profoundly significant! Yes, significant. But whenyou asked yourself, \"Of what?\" you found no answer. Will put the questioninto words.\"What do they mean?\" Vijaya repeated. \"They mean precisely whatthey are. And so do the mountains, so do the clouds, so do the lights anddarks. And that's why this is a genuinely religious image. Pseudoreligiouspictures always refer to something else, something beyond the things theyrepresent—some piece of metaphysical nonsense, some absurd dogmafromthe local theology. A genuinely religious image is always intrinsicallymeaningful. So that's why we hang this kind of painting in our meditationroom.\"\"Always landscapes?\"\"Almost always. Landscapes can really remind people of whothey are.\"\"Better than scenes from the life of a saint or savior?\"Vijaya nodded. \"It's the difference, to begin with, between objectiveand subjective. A picture of Christ or Buddha is merely the record ofsomething observed by a behaviorist and interpreted by a theologian. Butwhen you're confronted with a landscape like this, it's psychologically"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"impossible for you to look at it with the eyes of a J. B. Watson or the mindof a Thomas Aquinas. You're almost forced to submit to your immediateexperience; you're practically compelled to performan act of self-knowing.\"\"Self-knowing?\"\"Self-knowing,\" Vijaya insisted. \"This view of the next valley is a view,at one remove, of your own mind, of everybody's mind as it exists aboveand below the level of personal history. Mysteries of darkness; but thedarkness teems with life. Apocalypses of light; and the light shines out asbrightly fromthe flimsy little houses as from the trees, the grass, the bluespaces between the clouds. We do our best to disprove the fact, but a factit remains; man is as divine as nature, as infinite as the Void. But that'sgetting perilously close to theology, and nobody was ever saved by a225notion. Stick to the data, stick to the concrete facts.\" He pointed a finger atthe picture. \"The fact of half a village in sunshine and half in shadow and insecret. The fact of those indigo mountains and of the more fantasticmountains of vapor above them. The fact of blue lakes in the sky, lakes ofpale green and raw sienna on the sunlit earth. The fact of this grass in theforeground, this clump of bamboos only a few yards down the slope, andthe fact, at the same time, of those faraway peaks and the absurd littlehouses two thousand feet below in the valley. Distance,\" he addedparenthetically, \"their ability to express the fact of distance—that's yetanother reason why landscapes are the most genuinely religious pictures.\"\"Because distance lends enchantment to the view?\" \"No; because itlends reality. Distance reminds us that there's a lot more to the universethan just people—that there's even a lot more to people than just people. Itreminds us that there are mental spaces inside our skulls as enormous asthe spaces out there. The experience of distance, of inner distance andouter distance, of distance in time and distance in space—it's the first andfundamental religious experience. 'O Death in life, the days that are nomore'—and O the places, the infinite number of places that are not thisplace! Past pleasures, past unhappinesses and insights—all so intenselyalive in our memories and yet all dead, dead without hope of resurrection.And the village down there in the valley so clearly seen even in theshadow, so real and indubitable, and yet so hopelessly out of reach,incommunicado. A picture like this is the proof of man's capacity to acceptall the deaths in life, all the yawning absences surrounding every presence.To my mind,\" Vijaya added, \"the worst feature of your nonrepresentational"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"art is its systematic two-dimensionality, its refusal to take account of theuniversal experience of distance. As a colored object, a piece of abstractexpressionism can be very handsome. It can also serve as a kind ofglorified Rorschach inkblot. Everybody can find in it a symbolic expressionof his226Islandown fears, lusts, hatreds, and daydreams. But can one ever find in it thosemore than human (or should one say those other than all too human) factsthat one discovers in oneself when the mind is confronted by the outerdistances of nature, or by the simultaneously inner and outer distances of apainted landscape like this one we're looking at? All I know is that in yourabstractions I don't find the realities that reveal themselves here, and Idoubt if anyone else can. Which is why this fashionable abstract nonob-jective expressionism of yours is so fundamentally irreligious—and also, Imay add, why even the best of it is so profoundly boring, so bottomlesslytrivial.\"\"Do you come here often?\" Will asked after a silence. \"Whenever I feellike meditating in a group rather than alone.\"\"How often is that?\"\"Once every week or so. But of course some people like to do itoftener—and some much more rarely, or even never. It depends on one'stemperament. Take our friend Susila, for example—she needs big doses ofsolitude; so she hardly ever comes to the meditation room. WhereasShanta (that's my wife) likes to look in here almost every day.\"\"So do I,\" said Mrs. Rao. \"But that's only to be expected,\" she addedwith a laugh. \"Fat people enjoy company—even when they're meditating.\"\"And do you meditate on this picture?\" Will asked. \"Not on it. Fromit, ifyou see what I mean. Or rather parallel with it. I look at it, and the otherpeople look at it, and it reminds us all of who we are and what we aren't,and how what we aren't might turn into who we are.\"\"Is there any connection,\" Will asked, \"between what you've beentalking about and what I saw up there in the Shiva temple?\" \"Of coursethere is,\" she answered. \"The moksha-medicine takes you to the sameplace as you get to in meditation.\" \"So why bother to meditate?\"227\"You might as well ask, Why bother to eat your dinner?\" \"But,"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"according to you, the moksha-medicne is dinner.\" \"It's a banquet,\" she saidemphatically. \"And that's precisely why there has to be meditation. Youcan't have banquets every day. They're too rich and they last too long.Besides, banquets are provided by a caterer; you don't have any part in thepreparation of them. For your everyday diet you have to do your owncooking. The moksha-medicine comes as an occasional treat.\"\"In theological terms,\" said Vijaya, \"the moksha-medicine prepares onefor the reception of gratuitous graces—premystical visions or the full-blownmystical experiences. Meditation is one of the ways in which one co-operates with those gratuitous graces.\" \"How?\"\"By cultivating the state of mind that makes it possible for the dazzlingecstatic insights to become permanent and habitual illuminations. Bygetting to know oneself to the point where one won't be compelled by one'sunconscious to do all the ugly, absurd, self-stultifying things that one sooften finds oneself doing.\"\"You mean, it helps one to be more intelligent?\" \"Not more intelligent inrelation to science or logical argument—more intelligent on the deeper levelof concrete experiences and personal relationships.\"\"More intelligent on that level,\" said Mrs. Rao, \"even though one maybe very stupid upstairs.\" She patted the top of her head. \"I'mtoo dumb tobe any good at the things that Dr. Robert and Vijaya are good at—geneticsand biochemistry and philosophy and all the rest. And I'mno good atpainting or poetry or acting. No talents and no cleverness. So I ought to feelhorribly inferior and depressed. But in fact I don't—thanks entirely to themoksha-medicine and meditation. No talents or cleverness. But when itcomes to living, when it comes to understanding people and helping them, Ifeel myself growing more228Islandand more sensitive and skillful. And when it comes to what Vijaya callsgratuitous graces ...\" She broke off. \"You could be the greatest genius inthe world, but you wouldn't have anything more than what I've been given.Isn't that true, Vijaya?\"\"Perfectly true.\"She turned back to Will. \"So you see, Mr. Farnaby, Pala's the place forstupid people. The greatest happiness of the greatest number—and westupid ones are the greatest number. People like Dr. Robert and Vijaya andmy darling Ranga—we recognize their superiority, we know very well thattheir kind of intelligence is enormously important. But we also know that our"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"kind of intelli gence is just as important. And we don't envy them, becausewe're given just as much as they are. Sometimes even more.\"\"Sometimes,\" Vijaya agreed, \"even more. For the simple rea son that atalent for manipulating symbols tempts its possessors into habitual symbolmanipulation, and habitual symbol manipulation is an obstacle in the way ofconcrete experiencing and the reception of gratuitous graces.\"\"So you see,\" said Mrs. Rao, \"you don't have to feel too sorry for us.\"She looked at her watch. \"Goodness, I shall be late for Dillip's dinner if Idon't hurry.\"She started briskly towards the door.\"Time, time, time,\" Will mocked. \"Time even in this place of timelessmeditation. Time for dinner breaking incorrigibly into eternity.\" He laughed.Never take yes for an answer. The nature of things is always no.Mrs. Rao halted for a moment and looked back at him.\"But sometimes,\" she said with a smile, \"it's eternity that miraculouslybreaks into time—even into dinnertime. Goodbye.\" She waved her handand was gone.\"Which is better,\" Will wondered aloud as he followed Vijaya throughthe dark temple, out into the noonday glare, \"which is better—to be bornstupid into an intelligent society or intelligent into an insane one?\"229\"Here we are,\" said Vijaya, when they had reached the end of the shortstreet that led downhill fromthe marketplace. He opened a wicket gate andushered his guest into a tiny garden, at the further end of which, on its lowstilts, stood a small thatched house.Frombehind the bungalow a yellow mongrel dog rushed out andgreeted them with a frenzy of ecstatic yelps and jumps and tail-waggings. Amoment later a large green parrot, with white cheeks and a bill of polishedjet, came swooping down fromnowhere and landed with a squawk and anoisy fluttering of wings on Vijaya's shoulder.\"Parrots for you,\" said Will, \"mynahs for little Mary Sarojini. You peopleseem to be on remarkably good terms with the local fauna.\"Vijaya nodded. \"Pala is probably the only country in which an animaltheologian would have no reason for believing in devils. For animalseverywhere else, Satan, quite obviously, is Homo sapiens.'They climbed the steps to the veranda and walked through the openfront door into the bungalow's main living room."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"230IslandSeated on a low chair near the window, a young woman in blue wasnursing her baby son. She lifted a heart-shaped face that narrowed downfroma broad forehead to a delicately pointed chin, and gave them awelcoming smile.\"I've brought Will Farnaby,\" said Vijaya as he bent down to kiss her.Shanta held out her free hand to the stranger.\"I hope Mr. Farnaby doesn't object to nature in the raw,\" she said. Asthough to give point to her words, the baby withdrew his mouth from thebrown nipple, and belched. A white bubble of milk appeared between hislips, swelled up and burst. He belched again, then resumed his sucking.\"Even at eight months,\" she added, \"Rama's table manners are still ratherprimitive.\"\"A fine specimen,\" said Will politely. He was not much interested inbabies and had always been thankful for those repeated miscarriageswhich had frustrated all Molly's hopes and longings for a child. \"Who's hegoing to look like—you or Vijaya?\"Shanta laughed and Vijaya joined in, enormously, an octave lower.\"He certainly won't look like Vijaya,\" she answered.\"Why not?\"\"For the sufficient reason,\" said Vijaya, \"that I'm not geneticallyresponsible.\"\"In other words, the baby isn't Vijaya's son.\"Will looked from one laughing face to the other, then shrugged hisshoulders. \"I give up.\"\"Four years ago,\" Shanta explained, \"we produced a pair of twins whoare the living image of Vijaya. This time we thought it would be fun to havea complete change. We decided to enrich the family with an entirely newphysique and temperament. Did you ever hear of Gobind Singh?\"\"Vijaya has just been showing me his painting in your meditationroom.\"231\"Well, that's the man we chose for Rama's father.\"\"But I understood he was dead.\"Shanta nodded. \"But his soul goes marching along.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"DF and AI.\""},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"\"DFandAI?\"\"Deep Freeze and Artificial Insemination.\"\"Oh, I see.\"\"Actually,\" said Vijaya, \"we developed the techniques of AI abouttwenty years before you did. But of course we couldn't do much with it untilwe had electric power and reliable refrigerators. We got those in the latetwenties. Since then we've been using AI in a big way.\"\"So you see,\" Shanta chimed in, \"my baby might grow up to be apainter—that is, if that kind of talent is inherited. And even if it isn't he'll be alot more endomorphic and viscerotonic than his brothers or either of hisparents. Which is going to be very interesting and educative for everybodyconcerned.\"\"Do many people go in for this kind of thing?\" Will asked.\"More and more. In fact I'd say that practically all the couples whodecide to have a third child now go in for AI. So do quite a lot of those whomean to stop at number two. Take my family, for example. There's beensome diabetes among my father's people; so they thought it best—he andmy mother—to have both their children by AI. My brother's descended fromthree generations of dancers and, genetically, I'mthe daughter of Dr.Robert's first cousin, MalcolmChakravarti-MacPhail, who was the OldRaja's private secretary.\"\"And the author,\" Vijaya added, \"of the best history of Pala.Chakravarti-MacPhail was one of the ablest men of his generation.\"Will looked at Shanta, then back again at Vijaya.\"And has the ability been inherited?\" he asked.\"So much so,\" Vijaya answered, \"that I have the greatest dif-232Islandficulty in maintaining my position of masculine superiority. Shanta has morebrains than I have; but fortunately she can't compete with my brawn.\"\"Brawn,\" Shanta repeated sarcastically, \"brawn ... I seemto remembera story about a young lady called Delilah.\"\"Incidentally,\" Vijaya went on, \"Shanta has thirty-two half brothers andtwenty-nine half sisters. And more than a third of them are exceptionallybright.\"\"So you're improving the race.\"\"Very definitely. Give us another century, and our average IQ will beup to a hundred and fifteen.\"\"Whereas ours, at the present rate of progress, will be down to about"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"eighty-five. Better medicine—more congenital deficiencies preserved andpassed on. It'll make things a lot easier for future dictators.\" At the thoughtof this cosmic joke he laughed aloud. Then, after a silence, \"What aboutthe ethical and religious aspects of AI?\" he asked.\"In the early days,\" said Vijaya, \"there were a good manyconscientious objectors. But now the advantages of AI have been soclearly demonstrated, most married couples feel that it's more moral to takea shot at having a child of superior quality than to run the risk of slavishlyreproducing whatever quirks and defects may happen to run in thehusband's family. Meanwhile the theologians have got busy. AI has beenjustified in terms of reincarnation and the theory of karma. Pious fathersnow feel happy at the thought that they're giving their wife's children achance of creating a better destiny for themselves and their posterity.\"\"A better destiny?\"\"Because they carry the germplasm of a better stock. And the stock isbetter because it's the manifestation of a better karma. We have a centralbank of superior stocks. Superior stocks of every variety of physique andtemperament. In your kind of environment, most people's heredity nevergets a fair chance. In ours, it does. And incidentally we have excellentgenealogical233and anthropometric records going back as far as the eighteen-seventies.So you see we're not working entirely in the dark. For example, we knowthat Gobind Singh's maternal grandmother was a gifted mediumand livedto ninety-six.\"\"So you see,\" said Shanta, \"we may even have a centenarianclairvoyant in the family.\" The baby belched again. She laughed. \"Theoracle has spoken—as usual, very enigmatically.\" Turning to Vijaya, \"If youwant lunch to be ready on time,\" she added, \"you'd better go and dosomething about it. Rama's going to keep me busy for at least another tenminutes.\"Vijaya rose, laid one hand on his wife's shoulder and with the othergently rubbed the baby's brown back.Shanta bent down and passed her cheek across the top of the child'sdowny head. \"It's father,\" she whispered. \"Good father, good, good. ...\"Vijaya administered a final pat, then straightened himself up. \"Youwere wondering,\" he said to Will, \"how it is that we get on so well with thelocal fauna. I'll show you.\" He raised his hand. \"Polly. Polly.\" Cautiously, the"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"big bird stepped fromhis shoulder to the extended forefinger. \"Polly's agood bird,\" he chanted. \"Polly's a very good bird.\" He lowered his hand tothe point where a contact was made between the bird's body and thechild's, then moved it slowly, feathers against brown skin, back and forth,back and forth. \"Polly's a good bird,\" he repeated, \"a good bird.\"The parrot uttered a succession of low chuckles, then leaned forwardfromits perch on Vijaya's finger and very gently nibbled at the child's tinyear.\"Such a good bird,\" Shanta whispered, taking up the refrain. \"Suchgood bird.\"\"Dr. Andrew picked up the idea,\" said Vijaya, \"while he was serving asa naturalist on the Melampus. Froma tribe in northern New Guinea.Neolithic people; but like you Christians and us Buddhists, they believed inlove. And unlike us and you, they'd234Islandinvented some very practical ways of making their belief come true. Thistechnique was one of their happiest discoveries. Stroke the baby whileyou're feeding him; it doubles his pleasure. Then, while he's sucking andbeing caressed, introduce him to the ani mal or person you want himtolove. Rub his body against theirs; let there be a warm physical contactbetween child and love object. At the same time repeat some word like'good.' At first he'll understand only your tone of voice. Later on, when helearns to speak, he'll get the full meaning. Food plus caress plus contactplus 'good' equals love. And love equals pleasure, love equals satisfaction.\"\"Pure Pavlov.\"\"But Pavlov purely for a good purpose. Pavlov for friendliness and trustand compassion. Whereas you prefer to use Pavlov for brainwashing,Pavlov for selling cigarettes and vodka and patriotism. Pavlov for thebenefit of dictators, generals and tycoons.\"Refusing any longer to be left out in the cold, the yellow mongrel hadjoined the group and was impartially licking every piece of sentient matterwithin its reach—Shanta's arm, Vijaya's hand, the parrot's feet, the baby'sbackside. Shanta drew the dog closer and rubbed the child against its furryflank.\"And this is a good good dog,\" she said. \"Dog Toby, good good dogToby.\"Will laughed. \"Oughtn't I to get into the act?\""},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"\"I was going to suggest it,\" Shanta answered, \"only I was afraid you'dthink it was beneath your dignity.\"\"You can take my place,\" said Vijaya. \"I must go and see about ourlunch.\"Still carrying the parrot, he walked out through the door that led intothe kitchen. Will pulled up his chair and, leaning for ward, began to strokethe child's tiny body.\"This is another man,\" Shanta whispered. \"A good man, baby, kgood,man.\"235\"How I wish it were true!\" he said with a rueful little laugh. \"Here andnow it is true.\" And bending down again over the child, \"He's a good man,\"she repeated. \"A good good man.\"He looked at her blissful, secretly smiling face, he felt the smoothnessand warmth of the child's tiny body against his fingertips. Good, good, good. . . He too might have known this goodness—but only if his life had beencompletely different fromwhat in fact, in senseless and disgusting fact, itwas. So never take yes for an answer, even when, as now, yes is self-evident. He looked again with eyes deliberately attuned to anotherwavelength of value, and saw the caricature of a Memling altarpiece.\"Madonna with Child, Dog, Pavlov and Casual Acquaintance.\" Andsuddenly he could almost understand, from the inside, why Mr. Bahu sohated these people. Why he was so bent—in the name, as usual andneedless to say, of God—on their destruction. \"Good,\" Shanta was stillmurmuring to her baby, \"good, good, good.\"Too good—that was their crime. It simply wasn't permissible. And yethow precious it was! And how passionately he wished that he might havehad a part in it! \"Pure sentimentality!\" he said to himself; and then aloud,\"Good, good, good,\" he echoed ironically. \"But what happens when thechild grows a little bigger and discovers that a lot of things and people arethoroughly bad, bad, bad?\"\"Friendliness evokes friendliness,\" she answered. \"Fromthe friendly—yes. But not from the greedy, not fromthe power lovers, not fromthefrustrated and embittered. For them, friendliness is just weakness, just aninvitation to exploit, to bully, to take vengeance with impunity.\"\"But one has to run the risk, one has to make a beginning. And luckilyno one's immortal. The people who've been conditioned to swindling andbullying and bitterness will all be dead in a few years.

And, ofcourse, it will remain in its present state until we do try. Try and, what'smore, succeed at least as well as you've succeeded. Which brings me backto my original question. What happens when good, good, good discoversthat, even in Pala, there's a lot of bad, bad, bad? Don't the children getsome pretty unpleasant shocks?\"\"We try to inoculate themagainst those shocks.\"\"How? By making things unpleasant for themwhile they're still young?\"\"Not unpleasant. Let's say real. We teach themlove and confidence,but we expose themto reality, reality in all its aspects. And then give themresponsibilities. They're made to understand that Pala isn't Eden or theLand of Cockaigne. It's a nice place all right. But it will remain nice only ifeverybody works and behaves decently. And meanwhile the facts of life arethe facts of life. Even here.\"\"What about the facts of life in those bloodcurdling snakes I methalfway up the precipice? You can say 'good, good, good' as much as youlike; but snakes will still bite.\"\"You mean, they still can bite. But will they in fact make use of theirability?\"\"Why shouldn't they?\"\"Look over there,\" said Shanta. He turned his head and saw that whatshe was pointing at was a niche in the wall behind him. Within the nichewas a stone Buddha, about half life-size, seated upon a curiously groovedcylindrical pedestal and surmounted by a kind of lead-shaped canopy thattapered down behind himinto a broad pillar. \"It's a small replica,\" she wenton, \"of the237Buddha in the Station Compound—you know, the huge figure by thelotus pool.\""},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"\"Which is a magnificent piece of sculpture,\" he said. \"And the smilereally gives one an inkling of what the Beatific Vision must be like. But whathas it got to do with snakes?\"\"Look again.\"He looked. \"I don't see anything specially significant.\"\"Look harder.\"The seconds passed. Then, with a shock of surprise, he noticedsomething strange and even disquieting. What he had taken for an oddlyornamented cylindrical pedestal had suddenly revealed itself as a hugecoiled snake. And that downward tapering canopy under which the Buddhawas sitting was the expanded hood, with the flattened head at the center ofits leading edge, of a giant cobra.\"My God!\" he said. \"I hadn't noticed. How unobservant can one be?\"\"Is this the first time you've seen the Buddha in this context?\"\"The first time. Is there some legend?\"She nodded. \"One of my favorites. You know about the Bodhi Tree, ofcourse?\"\"Yes, I know about the Bodhi Tree.\"\"Well, that wasn't the only tree that Gautama sat under at the time ofhis Enlightenment. After the Bodhi Tree, he sat for seven days under abanyan, called the Tree of the Goatherd. And after that he moved on to theTree of Muchalinda.\"\"Who was Muchalinda?\"\"Muchalinda was the King of the Snakes and, being a god, he knewwhat was happening. So when the Buddha sat down under his tree, theSnake King crawled out of his hole, yards and yards of him, to pay Nature'shomage to Wisdom. Then a great stormblew up from the west. The divinecobra wrapped its coils round the more than divine man's body, spread itshood over his head238Islandand, for the seven days his contemplation lasted, sheltered the Tathagatafromthe wind and rain. So there he sits to this day, with cobra beneath him,cobra above him, conscious simultaneously of cobra and the Clear Lightand their ultimate identity.\"\"How very different,\" said Will, \"fromour view of snakes!\"\"And your view of snakes is supposed to be God's view—rememberGenesis.\"\" 'I will put enmity between thee and the woman,' \" he quoted, \" 'and"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"between her seed and thy seed.' \"\"But Wisdomnever puts enmity anywhere.

Wisdom doesn't make those insaneseparations.\"\"Nor does Science.\"\"Wisdom takes Science in its stride and goes a stage further.\"\"And what about totemism?\" Will went on. \"What about the fertilitycults? They didn't make any separations. Were they Wisdom?\"\"Of course they were—primitive Wisdom, Wisdomon the neolithiclevel. But after a time people begin to get self-conscious and the old DarkGods come to seemdisreputable. So the scene changes. Enter the Godsof Light, enter the Prophets, enter Pythagoras and Zoroaster, enter theJains and the early Buddhists. Between themthey usher in the Age of theCosmic Cockfight—Ormuzd versus Ahriman, Jehovah versus Satan andthe Baalim, Nirvana as opposed to Samsara, appearance over againstPlato's Ideal Reality. And except in the minds of a few Tankriks andMahayanists and Taoists and heretical Christians, the cockfight went on forthe best part of two thousand years.\"\"After which?\" he questioned.\"After which you get the beginnings of modern biology.\"Will laughed. \" 'God said, Let Darwin be,' and there was Nietzsche,Imperialismand Adolf Hitler.\"\"All that,\" she agreed. \"But also the possibility of a new kind239of Wisdom for everybody. Darwin took the old totemismand raised it to thelevel of biology. The fertility cults reappeared as genetics and HavelockEllis. And now it's up to us to take another half turn up the spiral. Darwinismwas the old neolithic Wisdomturned into scientific concepts. The newconscious Wisdom—the kind of Wisdom that was prophetically glimpsed inZen and Taoism and Tantra—is biological theory realized in living practice,is Darwinism raised to the level of compassion and spiritual insight. So yousee,\" she concluded, \"there isn't any earthly reason—much less anyheavenly reason—why the Buddha, or anyone else for that matter,shouldn't contemplate the Clear Light as manifested in a snake.\"\"Even though the snake might kill him?\" \"Even though it might kill him.\"\"And even though it's the oldest and most universal of phallicsymbols?\""},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Shanta laughed. \" 'Meditate under the Tree of Muchalinda'—that's theadvice we give to every pair of lovers. And in the intervals between thoseloving meditations remember what you were taught as children; snakes areyour brothers; snakes have a right to your compassion and your respect;snakes, in a word, are good, good, good.\"\"Snakes are also poisonous, poisonous, poisonous.\" \"But if youremember that they're just as good as they're poisonous, and actaccordingly, they won't use their poison.\" \"Who says so?\"\"It's an observable fact.

Next week I'mborrowing ourneighbor's pet python. For a few days I'll be giving Rama his lunch anddinner in the coils of the Old Serpent.\"Fromoutside the house came the sound of high-pitched laughter, thena confusion of children's voices interrupting one240Islandanother in English and Palanese. A moment later, looking very tall andmaternal by comparison with her charges, Mary Sarojini walked into theroomflanked by a pair of identical four-year-olds and followed by the sturdycherub who had been with her when Will first opened his eyes on Pala.\"We picked up Tara and Arjuna at the kindergarten,\" Mary Sarojiniexplained as the twins hurled themselves upon their mother.With the baby in one armand the other round the two little boys,Shanta smiled her thanks. \"That was very kind of you.\"It was Tom Krishna who said, \"You're welcome.\" He stepped forwardand, after a moment of hesitation, \"I was wondering ...\" he began, thenbroke off and looked appealingly at his sister. Mary Sarojini shook herhead.\"What were you wondering?\" Shanta enquired.\"Well, as a matter of fact, we were both wondering ... I mean, could wecome and have dinner with you?\"\"Oh, I see.\" Shanta looked from TomKrishna's face to Mary Sarojini'sand back again. \"Well, you'd better go and ask Vijaya if there's enough toeat. He's doing the cooking today.\"\"Okay,\" said TomKrishna without enthusiasm. With slow reluctantsteps he crossed the room and went out through the door into the kitchen.Shanta turned to Mary Sarojini. \"What happened?\"\"Well, Mother's told himat least fifty times that she doesn't like his"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"bringing lizards into the house. But this morning he did it again. So se gotvery cross with him.\"\"And you decided you'd better come and have dinner here?\"\"If it isn't convenhient, Shanta, we could try the Raos or theRajajinnadasas.\"\"I'mquite sure it will be convenient,\" Shanta assured her. \"I onlythought it would be good for Tom Krishna to have a little talk with Vijaya.\"\"You're perfectly right,\" said Mary Sarojini gravely. Then,241very businesslike, \"Tara, Arjuna,\" she called. \"Come with me to thebathroomand we'll get washed up. They're pretty grubby,\" she said toShanta as she led them away.Will waited until they were out of earshot, then turned to Shanta. \"Itake it that I've just been seeing a Mutual Adoption Club in action.\"\"Fortunately,\" said Shanta, \"in very mild action. TomKrishna and MarySarojini get on remarkably well with their mother. There's no personalproblem there—only the problem of destiny, the enormous and terribleproblemof Dugald's being dead.\"\"Will Susila marry again?\" he asked.\"I hope so. For everybody's sake. Meanwhile, it's good for the childrento spend a certain amount of time with one or other of their deputy fathers.Specially good for TomKrishna. Tom Krishna's just reaching the age whenlittle boys discover their maleness. He still cries like a baby; but the nextmoment he's bragging and showing off and bringing lizards into thehouse—just to prove he's two hundred percent a he-man. That's why Isent himto Vijaya. Vijaya's everything TomKrishna likes to imagine he is.Three yards high, two yards wide, terrifically strong, immensely competent.When he tells Tom Krishna how he ought to behave, Tom Krishna listens—listens as he would never listen to me or his mother saying the samethings. And Vijaya does say the same things as we would say. Because, ontop of being two hundred percent male, he's almost fifty percent sensitive-feminine. So, you see, TomKrishna is really getting the works. And now,\"she concluded, looking down at the sleeping child in her arms, \"I must putthis young man to bed and get ready for lunch.\"242Washed and brushed, the twins were already in their high chairs. Mary"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Sarojini hung over themlike a proud but anxious mother. At the stoveVijaya was ladling rice and vegetables out of an earthenware pot.Cautiously and with an expression on his face of focused concentration,TomKrishna carried each bowl, as it was filled, to the table.\"There!\" said Vijaya when the last brimming bowl had been sent on itsway. He wiped his hands, walked over to the table and took his seat.\"Better tell our guest about grace,\" he said to Shanta.Turning to Will, \"In Pala,\" she explained, \"we don't say grace beforemeals. We say it with meals. Or rather we don't say grace; we chew it.\"\"Chew it?\"\"Grace is the first mouthful of each course—chewed and chewed untilthere's nothing left of it. And all the time you're chewing you pay attention tothe flavor of the food, to its consistency and temperature, to the pressureson your teeth and the feel of the muscles in your jaws.\"243\"And meanwhile, I suppose, you give thanks to the Enlightened One,or Shiva, or whoever it may be?\"Shanta shook her head emphatically. \"That would distract yourattention, and attention is the whole point. Attention to the experience ofsomething given, something you haven't invented, not the memory of aformof words addressed to somebody in your imagination.\" She lookedround the table. \"Shall we begin?\"\"Hurrah!\" the twins shouted in unison, and picked up their spoons.For a long minute there was a silence, broken only by the twins whohad not yet learned to eat without smacking their lips.\"May we swallow now?\" asked one of the little boys at last.Shanta nodded. Everyone swallowed. There was a clinking of spoonsand a burst of talk fromfull mouths.\"Well,\" Shanta enquired, \"what did your grace taste like?\"\"It tasted,\" said Will, \"like a long succession of different things. Orrather a succession of variations on the fundamental theme of rice andturmeric and red peppers and zucchini and something leafy that I don'trecognize. It's interesting how it doesn't remain the same. I'd never reallynoticed that before.\"\"And while you were paying attention to these things, you weremomentarily delivered from daydreams, from memories, fromanticipations,fromsilly notions—from all the symptoms of you.'\"\"Isn't tasting me?\""},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Shanta looked down the length of the table to her husband. \"Whatwould you say, Vijaya?\"\"I'd say it was halfway between me and not-me. Tasting is not-medoing something for the whole organism. And at the same time tasting isme being conscious of what's happening. And that's the point of ourchewing-grace—to make the me more conscious of what the not-me is upto.\"244Island\"Very nice,\" was Will's comment. \"But what's the point of the point?\"It was Shanta who answered. \"The point of the point,\" she said, \"is thatwhen you've learned to pay closer attention to more of the not-you in theenvironment (that's the food) and more of the not-you in your own organism(that's your taste sensations), you may suddenly find yourself payingattention to the not-you on the further side of consciousness, or perhaps itwould be better,\" Shanta went on, \"to put it the other way round. The not-you on the further side of consciousness will find it easier to make itselfknown to a you that has learned to be more aware of its not-you on the sideof physiology.\" She was interrupted by a crash, followed by a howl fromone of the twins. \"After which,\" she continued as she wiped up the mess onthe floor, \"one has to consider the problem of me and not-me in relation topeople less than forty-two inches high. A prize of sixty-four thousand croresof rupees will be given to anyone who comes up with a foolproof solution.\"She wiped the child's eyes, had himblow his nose, then gave him a kissand went to the stove for another bowl of rice.\"What are your chores for this afternoon?\" Vijaya asked when lunchwas over.\"We're on scarecrow duty,\" Tom Krishna answered impor tantly.\"In the field just below the schoolhouse,\" Mary Sarojini added.\"Then I'll take you there in the car,\" said Vijaya. Turning to WillFarnaby, \"Would you like to come along?\" he asked.Will nodded. \"And if it's permissible,\" he said, \"I'd like to see theschool, while I'mabout it—sit in, maybe, at some of the classes.\"Shanta waved good-bye to themfromthe veranda and a few minuteslater they came in sight of the parked jeep.\"The school's on the other side of the village,\" explained245"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Vijaya as he started the motor. \"We have to take the bypass. It goesdown and then up again.\"Down through terraced fields of rice and maize and sweet potatoes,then on the level, along a contour line, with a muddy little fishpond on theleft and an orchard of breadfruit trees on the right, and finally up againthrough more fields, some green, some golden—and there was theschoolhouse, white and spacious under its towering shade trees.\"And down there,\" said Mary Sarojini, \"are our scarecrows.\"Will looked in the direction she was pointing. In the nearest of theterraced fields below them the yellow rice was almost ready to harvest.Two small boys in pink loincloths and a little girl in a blue skirt were takingturns at pulling the strings that set in motion two life-sized marionettesattached to poles at either end of the narrow field. The puppets were ofwood, beautifully carved and clothed, not in rags, but in the most splendiddraperies. Will looked at themin astonishment.\"Solomon in all his glory,\" he exclaimed, \"was not arrayed like one ofthese.\"But then Solomon, he went on to reflect, was only a king; thesegorgeous scarecrows were beings of a higher order. One was a FutureBuddha, the other a delightfully gay, East Indian version of God the Fatheras one sees him in the Sistine Chapel, swooping down over the newlycreated Adam. With each tug of the string the Future Buddha wagged hishead, uncrossed his legs from the lotus posture, danced a brief fandango inthe air, then crossed themagain and sat motionless for a moment untilanother jerk of the string once more disturbed his meditations. God theFather, meanwhile, waved his outstretched arm, wagged his forefinger inportentous warning, opened and shut his horsehair-fringed mouth androlled a pair of eyes which, being made of glass, flashed comminatory fireat any bird that dared to approach the rice. And all the time a brisk windwas fluttering his draperies, which were bright yellow, with a bold246Islanddesign—in brown, white and black—of tigers and monkeys, while theFuture Buddha's magnificent robes of red and orange rayon bellied andflapped around him with an Aeolian jingling of dozens of little silver bells.\"Are all your scarecrows like this?\" Will asked.\"It was the Old Raja's idea,\" Vijaya answered. \"He wanted to make thechildren understand that all gods are homemade, and that it's we who pulltheir strings and so give them the power to pull ours.\""},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"\"Make themdance,\" said Tom Krishna, \"make them wiggle.\" Helaughed delightedly.Vijaya stretched out an enormous hand and patted the child's darkcurly head. \"That's the spirit!\" And turning back to Will, \"Quote 'gods'unquote\" he said in what was evidently an imita tion of the Old Raja'smanner, \" —their one great merit apart fromscaring birds and quote'sinners' unquote, and occasionally, perhaps, consoling the miserable,consists in this: being raised aloft on poles, they have to be looked up at;and when anyone-looks up, even at a god, he can hardly fail to see the skybeyond. And what's the sky? Air and scattered light; but also a symbol ofthat boundless and (excuse the metaphor) pregnant emptiness out of whicheverything, the living and the inanimate, the puppet makers and their divinemarionettes, emerge into the universe we know—or rather that we think weknow.\"Mary Sarojini, who had been listening intently, nodded her head.\"Father used to say,\" she volunteered, \"that looking up at birds in the skywas even better. Birds aren't words, he used to say. Birds are real. Just asreal as the sky.\" Vijaya brought the car to a standstill. \"Have a good time,\"he said as the children jumped out. \"Make them dance and wiggle.\"Shouting, Tom Krishna and Mary Sarojini ran down to join the littlegroup in the field below the road.\"And now for the more solemn aspects of education.\" Vijaya turned thejeep into the driveway that led up to the schoolhouse.247\"I'll leave the car here and walk back to the station. When you've hadenough, get someone to drive you home.\" He turned off the ignition andhanded Will the key.In the school office Mrs. Narayan, the Principal, was talking across herdesk to a white-haired man with a long, rather doleful face like the face of alined and wrinkled bloodhound.\"Mr. Chandra Menon,\" Vijaya explained when the introductions hadbeen made, \"is our Under-Secretary of Education.\"\"Who is paying us,\" said the Principal, \"one of his periodical visits ofinspection.\"\"And who thoroughly approves of what he sees,\" the Under-Secretaryadded with a courteous bow in Mrs. Narayan's direction.Vijaya excused himself. \"I have to get back to my work,\" he said andmoved towards the door."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"\"Are you specially interested in education?\" Mr. Menon enquired.\"Specially ignorant would be more like it,\" Will answered. \"I was merelybrought up, never educated. That's why I'd like to have a look at thegenuine article.\"\"Well, you've come to the right place,\" the Under-Secretary assuredhim. \"New Rothamsted is one of our best schools.\"\"What's your criterion of a good school?\" Will asked.\"Success.\"\"In what? Winning scholarships? Getting ready for jobs? Obeying thelocal categorical imperatives?\"\"All that, of course,\" said Mr. Menon. \"But the fundamental questionremains. What are boys and girls for?\"Will shrugged his shoulders. \"The answer depends on where youhappen to be domiciled. For example, what are boys and girls for inAmerica? Answer: for mass consumption. And the corollaries of massconsumption are mass communications, mass advertising, mass opiates inthe form of television, meprobamate, positive thinking and cigarettes. Andnow that Europe has made248Islandthe breakthrough into mass production, what will its boys and girls be for?For mass consumption and all the rest—just like the boys and girls inAmerica. Whereas in Russia there's a different answer. Boys and girls arefor strengthening the national state. Hence all those engineers and scienceteachers, not to mention fifty divisions ready for instant combat andequipped with everything from tanks to H-bombs and long-range rockets.And in China it's the same, but a good deal more so. What are boys andgirls for there? For cannon fodder, industry fodder, agriculture fodder, road-building fodder. So East is East and West is West—for the moment. Butthe twain may meet in one or other of two ways. West may get sofrightened of East they it will give up thinking that boys and girls are formass consumption and decide instead that they're for cannon fodder andstrengthening the state. Alternatively East may find itself under suchpressure fromthe appliance-hungry masses who long to go Western, that itwill have to change its mind and say that boys and girls are really for massconsumption. But that's for the future. As of now, the current answers toyour question are mutually exclusive.\"\"And both of the answers,\" said Mr. Menon, \"are different from ours.What are Palanese boys and girls for? Neither for mass consumption, nor"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"for strengthening the state. The state has to exist, of course. And there hasto be enough for everybody. That goes without saying. It's only on thoseconditions that boys and girls can discover what in fact they are for-—onlyon those conditions that we can do anything about it.\"\"And what in fact are they for?\"\"For actualization, for being turned into full-blown human beings.\"Will nodded. \"Notes on What's What,\" he commented. \"Become whatyou really are.\"\"The Old Raja,\" said Mr. Menon, \"was mainly concerned with whatpeople really are on the level that's beyond individual ity. And of coursewe're just as much interested in that as he was.249But our first business is elementary education, and elementaryeducation has to deal with individuals in all their diversity of shape, size,temperament, gifts and deficiencies. Individuals in their transcendent unityare the affair of higher education. That begins in adolescence and is givenconcurrently with advanced elementary education.\"\"Begins, I take it,\" said Will, \"with the first experience of the moksha-medicine.\"\"So you've heard about the moksha-medicine?\"\"I've even seen it in action.\"\"Dr. Robert,\" the Principal explained, \"took him yesterday to see aninitiation.\"\"By which,\" added Will, \"I was profoundly impressed. When I think ofmy religious training ...\" He left the sentence eloquently unfinished.\"Well, as I was saying,\" Mr. Menon continued, \"adolescents get bothkinds of education concurrently. They're helped to experience theirtranscendental unity with all other sentient beings and at the same timethey're learning, in their psychology and physiology classes, that each oneof us has his own constitutional uniqueness, everybody's different fromeverybody else.\"\"When I was at school,\" said Will, \"the pedagogues did their best toiron out those differences, or at least to plaster themover with the sameLate Victorian ideal—the ideal of the scholarly but Anglican football-playinggentleman. But now tell me what you do about the fact that everybody'sdifferent fromeverybody else.\"\"We begin,\" said Mr. Menon, \"by assessing the differences. Preciselywho or what, anatomically, biochemically and psychologically, is this child?"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"In the organic hierarchy, which takes precedence—his gut, his muscles, orhis nervous system? How near does he stand to the three polar extremes?How harmonious or how disharmonious is the mixture of his componentelements, physical and mental? How great is his inborn wish to250Islanddominate, or to be sociable, or to retreat into his inner world? And howdoes he do his thinking and perceiving and remembering? Is he a visualizeror a nonvisualizer? Does his mind work with images or with words, withboth at once, or with neither? How close to the surface is his storytellingfaculty? Does he see the world as Wordsworth and Traherne saw it whenthey were children? And, if so, what can be done to prevent the glory andthe freshness fromfading into the light of common day? Or, in moregeneral terms, how can we educate children on the conceptual levelwithout killing their capacity for intense nonverbal experience? How can wereconcile analysis with vision? And there are dozens of other questions thatmust be asked and answered. For example, does this child absorb all thevitamins in his food or is he subject to some chronic deficiency that, if it isn'trecognized and treated, will lower his vitality, darken his mood, make himsee ugliness, feel boredomand think foolishness or malice? And whatabout his blood sugar? What about his breathing? What about his postureand the way he uses his organismwhen he's working, playing, studying?And there are all the questions that have to do with special gifts. Does heshow signs of having a talent for music, for mathematics, for handlingwords, for observing accurately and for thinking logically and imaginativelyabout what he has observed? And finally how suggestible is he going to bewhen he grows up? All children are good hypnotic subjects—so good thatfour out of five of themcan be talked into somnambulism. In adults theproportion is reversed. Four out of five of themcan never be talked intosomnambulism. Out of any hundred children, which are the twenty who willgrow up to be suggestible to the pitch of somnambulism?\"\"Can you spot them in advance?\" Will asked. \"And if so, what's thepoint of spotting them?\"\"We can spot them,\" Mr. Menon answered. \"And it's very importantthat they should be spotted. Particularly important in your part of the world.Politically speaking, the twenty percent251"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"that can be hypnotized easily and to the limit is the most dangerouselement in your societies.\" \"Dangerous?\"\"Because these people are the propagandist's predestined vic-tims. Inan old-fashioned, prescientific democracy, any spellbinder with a goodorganization behind himcan turn that twenty percent of potentialsomnambulists into an army of regimented fanatics dedicated to the greaterglory and power of their hypnotist. And under a dictatorship these samepotential somnambulists can be talked into implicit faith and mobilized asthe hard core of the omnipotent party. So you see it's very important for anysociety that values liberty to be able to spot the future somnambulists whenthey're young. Once they've been spotted, they can be hypnotized andsystematically trained not to be hypnotizable by the enemies of liberty. Andat the same time, of course, you'd be well advised to reorganize your socialarrangements so as to make it difficult or impossible for the enemies ofliberty to arise or have any influence.\" \"Which is the state of things, Igather, in Pala?\" \"Precisely,\" said Mr. Menon. \"And that's why our potentialsomnambulists don't constitute a danger.\"\"Then why do you go to the trouble of spotting themin advance?\"\"Because, if it's properly used, their gift is so valuable.\" \"For DestinyControl?\" Will questioned, remembering those therapeutic swans and allthe things that Susila had said about pressing one's own buttons.The Under-Secretary shook his head. \"Destiny Control doesn't call foranything more than a light trance. Practically everybody's capable of that.The potential somnambulists are the twenty percent who can go into verydeep trance. And it's in very deep trance—and only in very deep trance—that a person can be taught how to distort time.\"\"Can you distort time?\" Will enquired.252IslandMr. Menon shook his head. \"Unfortunately I could never go deepenough. Everything I know had to be learned the long, slow way. Mrs.Narayan was more fortunate. Being one of the privileged twenty percent,she could take all kinds of educational short cuts that were completelyclosed to the rest of us.\"\"What sort of short cuts?\" Will asked, turning to the Principal.\"Short cuts to memorizing,\" she answered, \"short cuts to calculatingand thinking and problemsolving. One starts by learning how to experiencetwenty seconds as ten minutes, a minute as half an hour. In deep trance it'sreally very easy. You listen to the teacher's suggestions and you sit there"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"quietly for a long, long time. Two full hours—you'd be ready to take youroath on it. When you've been brought back, you look at your watch. Yourexperience of two hours was telescoped into exactly four minutes of clocktime.\"\"How?\"\"Nobody knows how,\" said Mr. Menon. \"But all those anecdotes aboutdrowning men seeing the whole of their life unfolding before themin a fewseconds are substantially true. The mind and the nervous system—orrather some minds and some nervous systems—happen to be capable ofthis curious feat; that's all that anybody knows. We discovered the factabout sixty years ago, and since then we've been exploiting it. Exploiting it,among other things, for educational purposes.\"\"For example,\" Mrs. Narayan resumed, \"here's a mathematicalproblem. In your normal state it might take you the best part of half an hourto solve. But now you distort time to the point where one minute issubjectively the equivalent of thirty minutes. Then you set to work on yourproblem. Thirty subjec tive minutes later it's solved. But thirty subjectiveminutes are one clock minute. Without the least sense of rush or strainyou've been working as fast as one of those extraordinary calculating boys,who turn up from time to time. Future geniuses like Ampere and Gauss, orfuture idiots like Dase—but all of them,253by some built-in trick of time distortion, capable of getting through an hour'shard work in a couple of minutes—some-rimes in a matter of seconds. I'monly an average student; but I could go into deep trance, which meant that Icould be taught how to telescope my time into a thirtieth of its normal span.Result: I was able to cover far more intellectual ground than I couldpossibly have covered if I'd had to do all my learning in the ordinary way.You can imagine what happens when somebody with a genius IQ is alsocapable of time distortion. The results are fantastic!\"\"Unfortunately,\" said Mr. Menon, \"they're not very common. In the lasttwo generations we've had precisely two time distorters of real genius, andonly five or six runners-up. But what Pala owes to those few is incalculable.So it's no wonder that we keep a sharp lookout for potentialsomnambulists!\"\"Well, you certainly ask plenty of searching questions about your littlepupils,\" Will concluded after a brief silence. \"What do you do when you'vefound the answers?\""},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"\"We start educating accordingly,\" said Mr. Menon. \"For example, weask questions about every child's physique and temperament. When wehave the answers, we sort out all the shyest, tensest, most overresponsiveand introverted children, and assemble them in a single group. Then, littleby little, the group is enlarged. First a few children with tendencies towardsindiscriminate sociability are introduced. Then one or two little muscle menand muscle women—children with tendencies towards aggressiveness andlove of power. It's the best method, we've found, for getting little boys andgirls at the three polar extremes to understand and tolerate one another.After a few months of carefully controlled mixing, they're ready to admit thatpeople with a different kind of hereditary makeup have just as good a rightto exist as they have.\"\"And the principle,\" said Mrs. Narayan, \"is explicitly taught as well asprogressively applied. In the lower forms we do the254Islandteaching in terms of analogies with familiar animals. Cats like to be bythemselves. Sheep like being together. Martens are fierce and can't betamed. Guinea pigs are gentle and friendly. Are you a cat person or asheep person, a guinea-pig person or a marten person? Talk about it inanimal parables, and even very small children can understand the fact ofhuman diversity and the need for mutual forbearance, mutual forgiveness.\"\"And later on,\" said Mr. Menon, \"when they come to read the Gita, wetell themabout the link between constitution and religion. Sheep peopleand guinea-pig people love ritual and public ceremonies and revivalisticemotion; their temperamental preferences can be directed into the Way ofDevotion. Cat people like to be alone, and their private broodings canbecome the Way of Self-Knowledge. Marten people want to do things, andthe problem is how to transform their driving aggressiveness into the Wayof Disinterested Action.\"\"And the way to the Way of Disinterested Action is what I was lookingat yesterday,\" said Will. \"The way that leads through woodchopping androck climbing—is that it?\"\"Woodchopping and rock climbing,\" said Mr. Menon, \"are specialcases. Let's generalize and say that the way to all the Ways leads throughthe redirection of power.\"\"What's that?\"\"The principle is very simple. You take the power generated by fear orenvy or too much noradrenalin, or else by some built-in urge that happens,"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"at the moment, to be out of place—you take it and, instead of using it to dosomething unpleasant to someone else, instead of repressing it and sodoing something unpleasant to yourself, you consciously direct it along achannel where it can do something useful, or, if not useful, at leastharmless.\"\"Here's a simple case,\" said the Principal. \"An angry or frustrated childhas worked up enough power for a burst of crying, or bad language, or afight. If the power generated is sufficient255for any of those things, it's sufficient for running, or dancing, more thansufficient for five deep breaths. I'll show you some dancing later on. For themoment, let's confine ourselves to breathing. Any irritated person whotakes five deep breaths releases a lot of tension and so makes it easier forhimself to behave rationally. So we teach our children all kinds of breathinggames, to be played whenever they're angry or upset. Some of the gamesare competitive. Which of two antagonists can inhale most deeply and say'om' on the outgoing breath for the longest time? It's a duel that ends,almost without fail, in reconciliation. But of course there are manyoccasions when competitive breathing is out of place. So here's a littlegame that an exasperated child can play on his own, a game that's basedon the local folklore. Every Palanese child has been brought up onBuddhist legends, and in most of these pious fairy stories somebody has avision of a celestial being. A Bodhisattva, say, in an explosion of lights,jewels and rainbows. And along with the glorious vision there's always anequally glorious olfaction; the fireworks are accompanied by an unutterablydelicious perfume. Well, we take these traditional phantasies—which are allbased, needless to say, on actual visionary experiences of the kind inducedby fasting, sensory deprivation or mushrooms—and we set them to work.Violent feelings, we tell the children, are like earthquakes. They shake usso hard that cracks appear in the wall that separates our private selvesfromthe shared, universal Buddha Nature. You get cross, something insideof you cracks and, through the crack, out comes a whiff of the heavenlysmell of enlightenment. Like champak, like ylang-ylang, like gardenias—only infinitely more wonderful. So don't miss this heavenliness that you'veaccidentally released. It's there every time you get cross. Inhale it, breatheit in, fill your lungs with it. Again and again.\"\"And they actually do it?\"\"After a few weeks of teaching, most of them do it as a mat-"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"256Islandter of course. And, what's more, a lot of themreally smell that perfume. Theold repressive 'Thou shalt not' has been translated into a new expressiveand rewarding 'Thou shalt.' Potentially harmful power has been redirectedinto channels where it's not merely harmless, but may actually do somegood. And meanwhile, of course, we've been giving the children systematicand carefully graduated training in perception and the proper use oflanguage. They're taught to pay attention to what they see and hear, and atthe same time they're asked to notice how their feel ings and desires affectwhat they experience of the outer world, and how their language habitsaffect not only their feelings and desires but even their sensations. Whatmy ears and my eyes record is one thing; what the words I use and themood I'm in and the purposes I'mpursuing allow me to perceive, makesense of and act upon is something quite different. So you see it's allbrought together into a single educational process. What we give thechildren is simultaneously a training in perceiving and imagining, a trainingin applied physiology and psychology, a training in practical ethics andpractical religion, a training in the proper use of language, and a training inself-knowledge. In a word, a training of the whole mind-body in all itsaspects.\"\"What's the relevance,\" Will asked, \"of all this elaborate training of themind-body to formal education? Does it help a child to do sums, or writegrammatically, or understand elementary physics?\"\"It helps a lot,\" said Mr. Menon. \"A trained mind-body learns morequickly and more thoroughly than an untrained one. It's also more capableof relating facts to ideas, and both of themto its own ongoing life.\"Suddenly and surprisingly—for that long melancholy face gave one theimpression of being incompatible with any expression of mirth moreemphatic than a rather weary smile—he broke into a loud long peal oflaughter.\"What's the joke?\"\"I was thinking of two people I met last time I was in En-257gland. At Cambridge. One of themwas an atomic physicist, the other was aphilosopher. Both extremely eminent. But one had a inental age, outsidethe laboratory, of about eleven and the other was a compulsive eater with a"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"weight problemthat he refused to lace. Two extreme examples of whathappens when you take a clever boy, give him fifteen years of the mostintensive formal education and totally neglect to do anything for the mind-body which has to do the learning and the living.\"\"And your system, I take it, doesn't produce that kind of academicmonster?\"The Under-Secretary shook his head. \"Until I went to Europe, I'd neverseen anything of the kind. They're grotesquely funny,\" he added. \"But,goodness, how pathetic! And, poor things, how curiously repulsive!\"\"Being pathetically and curiously repulsive—that's the price we pay forspecialization.\"\"For specialization,\" Mr. Menon agreed, \"but not in the sense youpeople ordinarily use the word. Specialization in that sense is necessaryand inevitable. No specialization, no civilization. And if one educates thewhole mind-body along with the symbol-using intellect, that kind ofnecessary specialization won't do much harm. But you people don'teducate the mind-body. Your cure for too much scientific specialization is afew more courses in the humanities. Excellent! Every education ought toinclude courses in the humanities. But don't let's be fooled by the name. Bythemselves, the humanities don't humanize. They're simply another formofspecialization on the symbolic level. Reading Plato or listening to a lectureon T. S. Eliot doesn't educate the whole human being; like courses inphysics or chemistry, it merely educates the symbol manipulator andleaves the rest of the living mind-body in its pristine state of ignorance andineptitude. Hence all those pathetic and repulsive creatures that soastonished me on my first trip abroad.\"\"What about formal education?\" Will now asked. \"What258Islandabout indispensable information and the necessary intellectual skills? Doyou teach the way we do?\"\"We teach the way you're probably going to teach in another ten orfifteen years. Take mathematics, for example. Historically mathematicsbegan with the elaboration of useful tricks, soared up into metaphysics andfinally explained itself in terms of struc ture and logical transformations. Inour schools we reverse the historical process. We begin with structure andlogic; then, skip ping the metaphysics, we go on fromgeneral principles toparticular applications.\"\"And the children understand?\""},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"\"Far better than they understand when one starts with utilitarian tricks.Fromabout five onwards practically any intelligent child can learnpractically anything, provided always that you present it to himin the rightway. Logic and structure in the form of games and puzzles. The childrenplay and, incredibly quickly, they catch the point. After which you can go onto prac tical applications. Taught in this way, most children can learn atleast three times as much, four times as thoroughly, in half the time. Orconsider another field where one can use games to implant anunderstanding of basic principles. All scientific think ing is in terms ofprobability. The old eternal verities are merely a high degree of likeliness;the immutable laws of nature are just statistical averages. How does oneget these profoundly unobvi-ous notions into children's heads? By playingroulette with them, by spinning coins and drawing lots. By teaching them allkinds of games with cards and boards and dice.\"\"Evolutionary Snakes and Ladders—that's the most popular game withthe little ones,\" said Mrs. Narayan. \"Another great favorite is MendelianHappy Families.\"\"And a little later,\" Mr. Menon added, \"we introduce them to a rathercomplicated game played by four people with a pack of sixty speciallydesigned cards divided into three suits. Psycho- logical bridge, we call it.Chance deals you your hand, but the259way you play it is a matter of skill, bluff and co-operation with your partner.\"\"Psychology, Mendelism, Evolution—your education seems to beheavily biological,\" said Will.\"It is,\" Mr. Menon agreed. \"Our primary emphasis isn't on physics andchemistry; it's on the sciences of life.\" \"Is that a matter of principle?\"\"Not entirely. It's also a matter of convenience and economicnecessity. We don't have the money for large-scale research in physicsand chemistry, and we don't really have any practical need for that kind ofresearch—no heavy industries to be made more competitive, noarmaments to be made more diabolical, not the faintest desire to land onthe backside of the moon. Only the modest ambition to live as fully humanbeings in harmony with the rest of life on this island at this latitude on thisplanet. We can take the results of your researches in physics andchemistry and apply them, if we want to or can afford it, to our ownpurposes. Meanwhile we'll concentrate on the research which promises todo us the greatest good—in the sciences of life and mind. If the politicians"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"in the newly independent countries had any sense,\" he added, \"they'd dothe same. But they want to throw their weight around; they want to havearmies, they want to catch up with the motorized television addicts ofAmerica and Europe. You people have no choice,\" he went on. \"You'reirretrievably committed to applied physics and chemistry, with all theirdismal consequences, military, political and social. But the underdevelopedcountries aren't committed. They don't have to follow your example. They'restill free to take the road we've taken—the road of applied biology, the roadof fertility control and the limited production and selective industrializationwhich fertility control makes possible, the road that leads towardshappiness from the inside out, through health, through awareness, througha change in one's attitude towards the world; not towards the mirage ofhappiness from the outside in, through260Islandtoys and pills and nonstop distractions. They could still choose our way; butthey don't want to, they want to be exactly like you, God help them. And asthey can't possibly do what you've done—at any rate within the time they'veset themselves—they're foredoomed to frustration and disappointment,predestined to the misery of social breakdown and anarchy, and then to themisery of enslavement by tyrants. It's a completely foreseeable tragedy,and they're walking into it with their eyes open.\"\"And we can't do anything about it,\" the Principal added.\"Can't do anything,\" said Mr. Menon, \"except go on doing what we'redoing now and hoping against hope that the example of a nation that hasfound a way of being happily human may be imitated. There's very littlechance of it; but it just might happen.\"\"Unless Greater Rendang happens first.\"\"Unless Greater Rendang happens first,\" Mr. Menon gravely agreed.\"Meanwhile we have to get on with our job, which is education. Is thereanything more that you'd like to hear about, Mr. Farnaby?\"\"Lots more,\" said Will. \"For example, how early do you start yourscience teaching?\"\"We start it at the same time we start multiplication and division. Firstlessons in ecology.\"\"Ecology? Isn't that a bit complicated?\"\"That's precisely the reason why we begin with it. Never give children achance of imagining that anything exists in isolation. Make it plain fromthevery first that all living is relationship. Show themrelationships in the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"woods, in the fields, in the ponds and streams, in the village and thecountry around it. Rub it in.\"\"And let me add,\" said the Principal, \"that we always teach the scienceof relationship in conjunction with the ethics of relationship. Balance, giveand take, no excesses—it's the rule in nature and, translated out of fact intomorality, it ought to be the rule among people. As I said before, childrenfind it very easy to261understand an idea when it's presented to themin a parable about animals.We give theman up-to-date version of Aesop's Fables. Not the oldanthropomorphic fictions, but true ecological fables with built-in, cosmicmorals. And another wonderful parable for children is the story of erosion.We don't have any good examples of erosion here; so we show themphotographs of what has happened in Rendang, in India and China, inGreece and the Levant, in Africa and America—all the places wheregreedy, stupid people have tried to take without giving, to exploit withoutlove or understanding. Treat Nature well, and Nature will treat you well.Hurt or destroy Nature, and Nature will soon destroy you. In a Dust Bowl,'Do as you would be done by' is self-evident—much easier for a child torecognize and understand than in an eroded family or village.Psychological wounds don't show—and anyhow children know so littleabout their elders. And, having no standards of comparison, they tend totake even the worst situation for granted, as though it were part of thenature of things. Whereas the difference between ten acres of meadow andten acres of gullies and blowing sand is obvious. Sand and gullies areparables. Confronted by them, it's easy for the child to see the need forconservation and then to go on from conservation to morality—easy for himto go on from the Golden Rule in relation to plants and animals and theearth that supports them to the Golden Rule in relation to human beings.And here's another important point. The morality to which a child goes onfromthe facts of ecology and the parables of erosion is a universal ethic.There are no Chosen People in nature, no Holy Lands, no UniqueHistorical Revelations. Conservation morality gives nobody an excuse forfeeling superior, or claiming special privileges. 'Do as you would be doneby' applies to our dealings with all kinds of life in every part of the world.We shall be permitted to live on this planet only for as long as we treat allnature with compassion and intelligence. Elementary ecology leads straightto elementary Buddhism.\""},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"262Island\"A few weeks ago,\" said Will after a moment of silence, \"I was lookingat Thorwald's book about what happened in eastern Germany betweenJanuary and May of 1945. Have either of you read it?\"They shook their heads.\"Then don't,\" Will advised. \"I was in Dresden five months after theFebruary bombing. Fifty or sixty thousand civilians—mostly refugeesrunning away from the Russians—burned alive in a single night. And allbecause little Adolf had never learned ecology,\" he smiled his flayedferocious smile, \"never been taught the first principles of conservation.\"One made a joke of it because it was too horrible to be talked aboutseriously.Mr. Menon rose and picked up his briefcase.\"I must be going.\" He shook hands with Will. It had been a pleasure,and he hoped that Mr. Farnaby would enjoy his stay in Pala. Meanwhile, ifhe wanted to know more about Palanese education, he had only to askMrs. Narayan. Nobody was better qualified to act as a guide and instructor.\"Would you like to visit some of the classrooms?\" Mrs. Narayan asked,when the Under-Secretary had left.Will rose and followed her out of the room and along a corridor.\"Mathematics,\" said the Principal as she opened a door. \"And this isthe Upper Fifth. Under Mrs. Anand.\"Will bowed as he was introduced. The white-haired teacher gave awelcoming smile and whispered, \"We're deep, as you see, in a problem.\"He looked about him. At their desks a score of boys and girls werefrowning, in a concentrated, pencil-biting silence, over their notebooks. Thebent heads were sleek and dark. Above the white or khaki shorts, abovethe long gaily colored skirts, the golden bodies glistened in the heat. Boys'bodies that showed the cage of the ribs beneath the skin, girls' bodies,fuller, smoother, with the swell of small breasts, firm, high-set, elegant asthe inventions263of a rococo sculptor of nymphs. And everyone took them completely forgranted. What a comfort, Will reflected, to be in a place where the Fall wasan exploded doctrine!Meanwhile Mrs. Anand was explaining—sotto voce so as not to"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"distract the problem solvers fromtheir task—that she always divided herclasses into two groups. The group of the visualizers, who thought ingeometrical terms, like the ancient Greeks, and the group of thenonvisualizers who preferred algebra and imageless abstractions.Somewhat reluctantly Will withdrew his attention from the beautiful unfallenworld of young bodies and resigned himself to taking an intelligent interestin human diversity and the teaching of mathematics.They took their leave at last. Next door, in a pale-blue classroomdecorated with paintings of tropical animals, Bodhisattvas and their bosomyShaktis, the Lower Fifth were having their biweekly lesson in ElementaryApplied Philosophy. Breasts here were smaller, arms thinner and lessmuscular. These philosophers were only a year away from childhood.\"Symbols are public,\" the young man at the blackboard was saying asWill and Mrs. Narayan entered the room. He drew a row of little circles,numbered them1, 2, 3, 4, and n. \"These are people,\" he explained. Thenfromeach of the little circles he drew a line that connected it with a squareat the left of the board. S he wrote in the center of the square. \"S is thesystemof symbols that the people use when they want to talk to oneanother. They all speak the same language—English, Palanese, Eskimo, itdepends where they happen to live. Words are public; they belong to all thespeakers of a given language; they're listed in dictionaries. And now let'slook at the things that happen out there.\" He pointed through the openwindow. Gaudy against a white cloud, half a dozen parrots came sailinginto view, passed behind a tree and were gone. The teacher drew a secondsquare at the opposite side of the board, labeled it E for \"events\" andconnected it by lines to the circles. \"What happens out there is264Islandpublic—or at least fairly public,\" he qualified. \"And what happens whensomebody speaks or writes words—that's also public. But the things thatgo on inside these little circles are private. Private.\" He laid a hand on hischest. \"Private.\" He rubbed his forehead. \"Private.\" He touched his eyelidsand the tip of his nose with a brown forefinger. \"Now let's make a simpleexperiment. Say the word 'pinch.' \"\"Pinch,\" said the class in ragged unison. \"Pinch . . .\"\"P-I-N-C-H—pinch. That's public, that's something you can look up inthe dictionary. But now pinch yourselves. Hard! Harder!\"To an accompaniment of giggles, of aies and ows, the children did asthey were told."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"\"Can anybody feel what the person sitting next to him is feeling?\"There was a chorus of noes.\"So it looks,\" said the young man, \"as though there were-—let's see,how many are we?\" He ran his eyes over the desks before him. \"It looks asthough there were twenty-three distinct and separate pains. Twenty-threein this one room. Nearly three thousand million of themin the whole world.Plus the pains of all the animals. And each of these pains is strictly private.There's no way of passing the experience from one center of pain toanother center of pain. No communication except indirectly through S.\" Hepointed to the square at the left of the board, then to the circles at thecenter. \"Private pains here in 1, 2, 3, 4, and n. News about private painsout here at S, where you can say 'pinch,' which is a public word listed in adictionary. And notice this: there's only one public word, 'pain,' for threethousand million private experiences, each of which is probably about asdifferent fromall the others as my nose is different fromyour noses andyour noses are different fromone another. A word only stands for the waysin which things or happenings of the same general kind are like oneanother. That's why the word is265public. And, being public, it can't possibly stand for the ways in whichhappenings of the same general kind are unlike one another.\"There was a silence. Then the teacher looked up and asked aquestion.\"Does anyone here know about Mahakasyapa?\"Several hands were raised. He pointed his finger at a little girl in a blueskirt and a necklace of shells sitting in the front row.\"You tell us, Amiya.\"Breathlessly and with a lisp, Amiya began.\"Mahakathyapa,\" she said, \"wath the only one of the di-thipleth thatunderthtood what the Buddha wath talking about.\"\"And what was he talking about?\"\"He wathn't talking. That'th why they didn't underthtand.\"\"But Mahakasyapa understood what he was talking about even thoughhe wasn't talking—is that it?\"The little girl nodded. That was it exactly. \"They thought he wath goingto preatth a thermon,\" she said, \"but he didn't. He jutht picked a flower andheld it up for everybody to look at.\"\"And that was the sermon,\" shouted a small boy in a yellow loincloth,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"who had been wriggling in his seat, hardly able to contain his desire toimpart what he knew. \"But nobody could underthand that kind of a thermon.Nobody but Mahakathyapa.\"\"So what did Mahakasyapa say when the Buddha held up that flower?\"\"Nothing!\" the yellow loincloth shouted triumphantly.\"He jutht thmiled,\" Amiya elaborated. \"And that thowed the Buddhathat he underthtood what it wath all about. So he thmiled back, and theyjutht that there, thmiling and thmiling.\"\"Very good,\" said the teacher. \"And now,\" he turned to the yellowloincloth, \"let's hear what you think it was that Mahakasyapa understood.\"266IslandThere was a silence. Then, crestfallen, the child shook his head. \"Idon't know,\" he mumbled. \"Does anyone else know?\"There were several conjectures. Perhaps he'd understood that peopleget bored with sermons—even the Buddha's sermons. Perhaps he likedflowers as much as the Compassionate One did. Perhaps it was a whiteflower, and that made himthink of the Clear Light. Or perhaps it was blue,and that was Shiva's color.\"Good answers,\" said the teacher. \"Especially the first one. Sermonsare pretty boring—especially for the preacher. But here's a question. If anyof your answers had been what Maha-kasyapa understood when Buddhaheld up the flower, why didn't he come out with it in so many words?\"\"Perhapth he wathn't a good thpeaker.\" \"He was an excellent speaker.\"\"Maybe he had a sore throat.\"\"If he'd had a sore throat, he wouldn't have smiled so hap-pily.\"\"You tell us,\" called a shrill voice fromthe back of the room. \"Yes, youtell us,\" a dozen other voices chimed in. The teacher shook his head. \"IfMahakasyapa and the Compassionate One couldn't put it into words, howcan I? Meanwhile let's take another look at these diagrams on theblackboard. Public words, more or less public events, and then people,completely private centers of pain and pleasure. \"'Completely private?\" hequestioned. \"But perhaps that isn't quite true. Perhaps, after all, there issome kind of communication between the circles—not in the way I'mcommunicating with you now, through words, but directly. And maybe thatwas what the Buddha was talking about when his wordless flower-sermonwas over. 'I have the treasure of the unmistakable teachings,' he said to hisdisciples, 'the wonderful Mind of Nirvana, the true formwithout form,beyond all words, the teaching to be given and received outside of all"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"doctrines. This I have now handed to267Mahakasyapa.' \" Picking up the chalk again, he traced a rough ellipsethat enclosed within its boundaries all the other diagrams on the board—the little circles representing human beings, the square that stood forevents, and the other square that stood for words and symbols. \"Allseparate,\" he said, \"and yet all one. People, events, words—they're allmanifestations of Mind, of Suchness, of the Void. What Buddha wasimplying and what Mahakasyapa understood was that one can't speakthese teachings, one can only be them. Which is something you'll alldiscover when the moment comes for your initiation.\"\"Time to move on,\" the Principal whispered. And when the door hadclosed behind themand they were standing again in the corridor, \"We usethis same kind of approach,\" she said to Will, \"in our science teaching,beginning with botany.\" \"Why with botany?\"\"Because it can be related so easily to what was being talked aboutjust now—the Mahakasyapa story.\" \"Is that your starting point?\"\"No, we start prosaically with the textbook. The children are given allthe obvious, elementary facts, tidily arranged in the standard pigeonholes.Undiluted botany—that's the first stage. Six or seven weeks of it. Afterwhich they get a whole morning of what we call bridge building. Two and ahalf hours during which we try to make themrelate everything they'velearned in the previous lessons to art, language, religion, self-knowledge.\"\"Botany and self-knowledge—how do you build that bridge?\"\"It's really quite simple,\" Mrs. Narayan assured him. \"Each of thechildren is given a common flower—a hibiscus, for example, or better still(because the hibiscus has no scent) a gardenia. Scientifically speaking,what is a gardenia? What does it consist of? Petals, stamens, pistil, ovary,and all the rest of it. The children are asked to write a full analyticaldescription of the flower, illustrated by an accurate drawing. When that'sdone there's a268Islandshort rest period, at the close of which the Mahakasyapa story is read tothemand they're asked to think about it. Was Buddha giving a lesson inbotany? Or was he teaching his disciples something else? And, if so,what?\" \"What indeed?\""},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"\"And of course, as the story makes clear, there's no answer that canbe put into words. So we tell the boys and girls to stop | thinking and justlook. 'But don't look analytically,' we tell them, 'don't look as scientists, evenas gardeners. Liberate yourselves fromeverything you know and look withcomplete innocence at this infinitely improbable thing before you. Look at itas though you'd never seen anything of the kind before, as though it had noname and belonged to no recognizable class. Look at it alertly butpassively, receptively, without labeling or judging or comparing. And as youlook at it, inhale its mystery, breathe in the spirit of sense, the smell of thewisdomof the Other Shore.' \"\"All this,\" Will commented, \"sounds very like what Dr. Robert wassaying at the initiation ceremony.\"\"Of course it does,\" said Mrs. Narayan. \"Learning to take theMahakasyapa's-eye view of things is the best preparation for the moksha-medicine experience. Every child who comes to initiation comes to it after along education in the art of being receptive. First the gardenia as abotanical specimen. Then the same gardenia in its uniqueness, thegardenia as the artist sees it, the even more miraculous gardenia seen bythe Buddha and Mahakasyapa. And it goes without saying,\" she added,\"that we don't confine ourselves to flowers. Every course the children takeis punctuated by periodical bridge-building sessions. Everything fromdissected frogs to the spiral nebulae, it all gets looked at receptively as wellas conceptually, as a fact of aesthetic or spiritual experience as well as interms of science or history or economics. Training in receptivity is thecomplement and antidote to training in analysis and symbol manipulation.Both kinds of269training are absolutely indispensable. If you neglect either of themyou'llnever grow into a fully human being.\"There was a silence. \"How should one look at other people?\" Willasked at last. \"Should one take the Freud's-eye view or the Cezanne's-eyeview? The Proust's-eye view or the Buddha's-eye view?\"Mrs. Narayan laughed. \"Which view are you taking of me?\" she asked.\"Primarily, I suppose, the sociologist's-eye view,\" he answered. \"I'mlooking at you as the representative of an unfamiliar culture. But I'malsobeing aware of you receptively. Thinking, if you don't mind my saying so,that you seem to have aged remarkably well. Well aesthetically, wellintellectually and psychologically, and well spiritually, whatever that word"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"means—and if I make myself receptive it means something important.Whereas, if I choose to project instead of taking in, I can conceptualize itinto pure nonsense.\" He uttered a mildly hyenalike laugh.\"If one chooses to,\" said Mrs. Narayan, \"one can always substitute abad ready-made notion for the best insights of receptivity. The question is,why should one want to make that kind of choice? Why shouldn't onechoose to listen to both parties and harmonize their views? The analyzingtradition-bound concept maker and the alertly passive insight receiver—neither is infallible; but both together can do a reasonably good job.\"\"Just how effective is your training in the art of being receptive?\" Willnow enquired.\"There are degrees of receptivity,\" she answered. \"Very little of it in ascience lesson, for example. Science starts with observation; but theobservation is always selective. You have to look at the world through alattice of projected concepts. Then you take the moksha-medicine, andsuddenly there are hardly any concepts. You don't select and immediatelyclassify what you experience; you just take it in. It's like that poem ofWordsworth's,270Island'Bring with you a heart that watches and receives.' In these bridge-buildingsessions I've been describing there's still quite a lot of busy selecting andprojecting, but not nearly so much as in the preceding science lessons. Thechildren don't suddenly turn into little Tathagatas; they don't achieve thepure receptivity that comes with the moksha-medicine. Far from it. All onecan say is that they learn to go easy on names and notions. For a littlewhile they're taking in a lot more than they give out.\"\"What do you make themdo with what they've taken in?\" \"We merelyask them,\" Mrs. Narayan answered, with a smile, \"to attempt theimpossible. The children are told to translate their experience into words.As a piece of pure, unconceptual-ized giveness, what is this flower, thisdissected frog, this planet at the other end of the telescope? What does itmean? What does it make you think, feel, imagine, remember? Try to put itdown on paper. You won't succeed, of course; but try all the same. It'll helpyou to understand the difference between words and events, betweenknowing about things and being acquainted with them. 'And when you'vefinished writing,' we tell them, 'look at the flower again and, after you'velooked, shut your eyes for a minute or two. Then draw what came to youwhen your eyes were closed. Draw whatever it may have been—something"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"vague or vivid, something like the flower itself or something entirelydifferent. Draw what you saw or even what you didn't see, draw it and colorit with your paints or crayons. Then take another rest and, after that,compare your first drawing with the second; compare the scientificdescription of the flower with what you wrote about it when you weren'tanalyzing what you saw, when you behaved as though you didn't knowanything about the flower and just permitted the mystery of its existence tocome to you, like that, out of the blue. Then compare your drawings andwritings with the drawings and writings of the other boys and girls in theclass. You'll notice that the analytical descriptions and illustrations are verysimilar, whereas the draw-271ings and writings of the other kind are very different one from another. Howis all this connected with what you have learned in school, at home, in thejungle, in the temple?' Dozens of questions, and all of theminsistent. Thebridges have to be built in all directions. One starts with botany—or anyother subject in the school curriculum—and one finds oneself, at the end ofa bridge-building session, thinking about the nature of language, aboutdifferent kinds of experience, about metaphysics and the conduct of life,about analytical knowledge and the wisdomof the Other Shore.\"\"How on earth,\" Will asked, \"did you ever manage to teach theteachers who now teach the children to build these bridges?\"\"We began teaching teachers a hundred and seven years ago,\" saidMrs. Narayan. \"Classes of young men and women who had been educatedin the traditional Palanese way. You know—good manners, goodagriculture, good arts and crafts, tempered by folk medicine, old-wives'physics and biology and a belief in the power of magic and the truth of fairytales. No sci-ence, no history, no knowledge of anything going on in theoutside world. But these future teachers were pious Buddhists; most ofthempracticed meditation and all of themhad read or listened to quite a lotof Mahayana philosophy. That meant that in the fields of appliedmetaphysics and psychology they'd been educated far more thoroughlyand far more realistically than any group of future teachers in your part ofthe world. Dr. Andrew was a scientifically trained, antidogmatic humanist,who had discovered the value of pure and applied Mahayana. His friend,the Raja, was a Tantrik Buddhist, who had discovered the value of pureand applied science. Both, consequently, saw very clearly that, to becapable of teaching children to become fully human in a society fit for fully"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"human beings to live in, a teacher would first have to be taught how tomake the best of both worlds.\"\"And how did those early teachers feel about it? Didn't they resist theprocess?\"272IslandMrs. Narayan shook her head. \"They didn't resist, for the good reasonthat nothing precious had been attacked. Their Buddhismwas respected.All they were asked to give up was the old-wives' science and the fairytales. And in exchange for those they got all kinds of much more interestingfacts and much more useful theories. And these exciting things from yourWestern world of knowledge and power and progress were now to becombined with, and in a sense subordinated to, the theories of Buddhismand the psychological facts of applied metaphysics. There was reallynothing in that best-of-both-worlds program to offend the susceptibilities ofeven the touchiest and most ardent of religious patriots.\"\"I'mwondering about our future teachers,\" said Will after a silence. \"Atthis late stage, would they be teachable? Could they possibly learn to makethe best of both worlds?\"\"Why not? They wouldn't have to give up any of the things that arereally important to them. The non-Christian could go on thinking about manand the Christian could go on worshiping God. No change, except that Godwould have to be thought of as immanent and man would have to bethought of as potentially self-transcendent.\"\"And you think they'd make those changes without any fuss?\" Willlaughed. \"You're an optimist.\"\"An optimist,\" said Mrs. Narayan, \"for the simple reason that, if onetackles a problemintelligently and realistically, the results are apt to befairly good. This island justifies a certain optimism. And now let's go andhave a look at the dancing class.\"They crossed a tree-shaded courtyard and, pushing through a swingdoor, passed out of silence into the rhythmic beat of a drumand thescreech of fifes repeating over and over again a short pen-tatonic tune thatto Will's ears sounded vaguely Scotch.\"Live music or canned?\" he asked.\"Japanese tape,\" Mrs. Narayan answered laconically. She273"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"opened a second door that gave access to a large gymnasiumwhere twobearded young men and an amazingly agile little old lady in black satinslacks were teaching some twenty or thirty little boys and girls the steps ofa lively dance.\"What's this?\" Will asked. \"Fun or education?\"\"Both,\" said the Principal. \"And it's also applied ethics. Like thosebreathing exercises we were talking about just now—only more effectivebecause so much more violent.\"\"So stamp it out,\" the children were chanting in unison. And theystamped their small sandaled feet with all their might. \"So stamp it out!\" Afinal furious stamp and they were off again, jigging and turning, into anothermovement of the dance.\"This is called the Rakshasi Hornpipe,\" said Mrs. Narayan.\"Rakshasi?\" Will questioned. \"What's that?\"\"A Rakshasi is a species of demon. Very large, and exceedinglyunpleasant. All the ugliest passions personified. The Rakshasi Hornpipe isa device for letting off those dangerous heads of steamraised by angerand frustration.\"\"So stamp it out!\" The music had come round again to the choralrefrain. \"So stamp it out!\"\"Stamp again,\" cried the little old lady setting a furious example.\"Harder! Harder!\"\"Which did more,\" Will speculated, \"for morality and rationalbehavior—the Bacchic orgies or the Republic) the Nico-machean Ethics orcorybantic dancing?\"\"The Greeks,\" said Mrs. Narayan, \"were much too sensible to think interms of either-or. For them, it was always not-only-but-also. Not only Platoand Aristotle, but also the maenads. Without those tension-reducinghornpipes, the moral philosophy would have been impotent, and withoutthe moral philosophy the hornpipers wouldn't have known where to go next.All we've done is to take a leaf out of the old Greek book.\"\"Very good!\" said Will approvingly. Then remembering (as274Islandsooner or later, however keen his pleasure and however genuine hisenthusiasm, he always did remember) that he was the man who wouldn'ttake yes for an answer, he suddenly broke into laughter. \"Not that it makesany difference in the long run,\" he said. \"Corybantism couldn't stop theGreeks fromcutting one another's throats. And when Colonel Dipa decides"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"to move, what will your Rakshasi Hornpipes do for you? Help you toreconcile yourselves to your fate, perhaps—that's all.\"\"Yes, that's all,\" said Mrs. Narayan. \"But being reconciled to one'sfate—that's already a great achievement.\"\"You seem to take it all very calmly.\"\"What would be the point of taking it hysterically? It wouldn't make ourpolitical situation any better; it would merely make our personal situation agood deal worse.\"\"So stamp it out,\" the children shouted again in unison, and the boardstrembled under their pounding feet. \"So stamp it out.\"\"Don't imagine,\" Mrs. Narayan resumed, \"that this is the only kind ofdancing we teach. Redirecting the power generated by bad feelings isimportant. But equally important is directing good feelings and rightknowledge into expression. Expressive movements, in this case,expressive gesture. If you had come yesterday, when our visiting masterwas here, I could have shown you how we teach that kind of dancing. Nottoday unfortu nately. He won't be here again before Tuesday.\"\"What sort of dancing does he teach?\"Mrs. Narayan tried to describe it. No leaps, no high kicks, no running.The feet always firmly on the ground. Just bendings and sideways motionsof the knees and hips. All expression confined to the arms, wrists andhands, to the neck and head, the face and, above all, the eyes. Movementfromthe shoulders upwards and outwards—movement intrinsicallybeautiful and at the same time charged with symbolic meaning. Thoughttaking275shape in ritual and stylized gesture. The whole body transformed into ahieroglyph, a succession of hieroglyphs, or attitudes modulating fromsignificance to significance like a poem or a piece of music. Movements ofthe muscles representing movements of Consciousness, the passage ofSuchness into the many, of the many into the immanent and ever-presentOne.\"It's meditation in action,\" she concluded. \"It's the metaphysics of theMahayana expressed, not in words, but through symbolic movements andgestures.\"They left the gymnasiumby a different door fromthat through whichthey had entered and turned left along a short corridor.\"What's the next item?\" Will asked."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"\"The Lower Fourth,\" Mrs. Narayan answered, \"and they're working onElementary Practical Psychology.\"She opened a green door.\"Well, now you know,\" Will heard a familiar voice saying. \"Nobody hasto feel pain. You told yourselves that the pin wouldn't hurt—and it didn'thurt.\"They stepped into the roomand there, very tall in the midst of a scoreof plump or skinny little brown bodies, was Susila MacPhail. She smiled atthem, pointed to a couple of chairs in a corner of the room, and turned backto the children. \"Nobody has to feel pain,\" she repeated. \"But never forget:pain always means that something is wrong. You've learned to shut painoff, but don't do it thoughtlessly, don't do it without asking yourselves thequestion: What's the reason for this pain? And if it's bad, or if there's noobvious reason for it, tell your mother about it, or your teacher, or anygrown-up in your Mutual Adoption Club. Then shut off the pain. Shut it offknowing that, if anything needs to be done, it will be done. Do youunderstand? . . . And now,\" she went on, after all the questions had beenasked and answered. \"Now let's play some pretending games. Shut276Islandyour eyes and pretend you're looking at that poor old mynah bird with oneleg that comes to school every day to be fed. Can you see him?\"Of course they could see him. The one-legged mynah was evidentlyan old friend.\"See himjust as clearly as you saw himtoday at lunchtime. And don'tstare at him, don't make any effort.

But now we're going to do some real pretending.Pretend that there are two one-legged mynah birds. Three one-leggedmynah birds. Four one-legged mynah birds. Can you see all four of them?\"They could.\"Four one-legged mynah birds at the four corners of a square, and afifth one in the middle. And now let's make themchange their color.

Goodness, what's happening! There aren't five of them; thereare ten. No, twenty, fifty, a hundred. Hundreds and hundreds. Can you seethem?\" Some of themcould—without the slightest difficulty; and for thosewho couldn't go the whole hog, Susila proposed more modest goals.\"Just make twelve of them,\" she said. \"Or if twelve is too many, maketen, make eight. That's still an awful lot of mynahs. And now,\" she went on,when all the children had conjured up277all the purple birds that each was capable of creating, \"now they're gone.\"She clapped her hands. \"Gone! Every single one of them. There's nothingthere. And now you're not going to see mynahs, you're going to see me.One me in yellow. Two mes in green. Three mes in blue with pink spots.Four mes in the brightest red you ever saw.\" She clapped her hands again.\"All gone. And this time it's Mrs. Narayan and that funny-looking man with astiff leg who came in with her. Four of each of them. Standing in a big circlein the gymnasium. And now they're dancing the Rakshasi Hornpipe. 'Sostamp it out, so stamp it out.' \"There was a general giggle. The dancing Wills and Principals musthave looked richly comical.Susila snapped her fingers.\"Away with them! Vanish! And now each of you sees three of yourmothers and three of your fathers running round the playground. Faster,faster, faster! And suddenly they're not there any more. And then they arethere. But next moment they aren't. They are there, they aren't. They are,they aren't...\"The giggles swelled into squeals of laughter and at the height of thelaughter a bell rang. The lesson in Elementary Practical Psychology wasover.\"What's the point of it all?\" Will asked when the children had run off toplay and Mrs. Narayan had returned to her office.\"The point,\" Susila answered, \"is to get people to understand thatwe're not completely at the mercy of our memory and our phantasies.

Just think what you could have done about your father, ifsomeone had taught you a few of these simple little tricks when you were achild! You thought of himas a terrifying ogre. But that wasn't necessary. Inyour fancy you could have turned the ogre into a grotesque. Into a wholechorus of grotesques. Twenty of them doing a tap dance and singing, 'Idreamt I dwelt in marble halls.'

What rites of imaginative exorcismcould he have practiced on that white, musk-scented succubus who wasthe incarnation of his frantic and abhorred desires?But here was the jeep. Will handed Susila the keys and laboriouslyhoisted himself into his seat. Very noisily, as though it were under someneurotic compulsion to overcompensate for its diminutive stature, a smalland aged car approached from the direction of the village, turned into thedriveway and, still clattering and shuddering, came to a halt beside thejeep.They turned. There, leaning out of the window of the royal BabyAustin, was Murugan, and beyond him, vast in white muslin and billowy likea cumulus cloud, sat the Rani. Will bowed in her direction and evoked themost gracious of smiles,279"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"which was switched off as soon as she turned to Susila, whose greetingwas acknowledged only with the most distant of nods.\"Going for a drive?\" Will asked politely.\"Only as far as Shivapuram,\" said the Rani.\"If this wretched little crate will hold together that long,\" Muruganadded bitterly. He turned the ignition key. The motor gave a last obscenehiccup and died.\"There are some people we have to see,\" the Rani went on. \"Or ratherOne Person,\" she added in a tone charged with conspiratorial significance.She smiled at Will and very nearly winked.Pretending not to understand that she was talking about Bahu, Willuttered a noncommittal \"Quite,\" and commiserated with her on all the workand worry that the preparations for next week's coming-of-age party mustentail.Murugan interrupted him. \"What are you doing out here?\" he asked.\"I've spent the afternoon taking an intelligent interest in Palaneseeducation.\"\"Palanese education,\" the Rani echoed. And again, sorrowfully,\"Palanese\" (pause) \"Education.\" She shook her head.\"Personally,\" said Will, \"I liked everything I saw and heard of it—fromMr. Menon and the Principal to Elementary Practical Psychology, astaught,\" he added, trying to bring Susila into the conversation, \"by Mrs.MacPhail here.\"Still studiedly ignoring Susila, the Rani pointed a thick accusing fingerat the scarecrows in the field below.\"Have you seen those, Mr. Farnaby?\"He had indeed. \"And where but in Pala,\" he asked, \"can one findscarecrows which are simultaneously beautiful, efficient, andmetaphysically significant?\"\"And which,\" said the Rani in a voice that was vibrant with a kind ofsepulchral indignation, \"not only scare the birds away from the rice; theyalso scare little children away from the very idea of God and His Avatars.\"She raised her hand. \"Listen!\"280IslandTomKrishna and Mary Sarojini had been joined by five or six smallcompanions and were making a game of tugging at the strings that workedthe supernatural marionettes. From the group came a sound of shrill voices"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"piping in unison. At their second repetition, Will made out the words of thechantey.Pully, hauly, tug with a will;The gods wiggle-waggle, but the sky stands still.\"Bravo!\" he said, and laughed.\"I'mafraid I can't be amused,\" said the Rani severely. \"It isn't funny. It'sTragic, Tragic.\"Will stuck to his guns. \"I understand,\" he said, \"that these charmingscarecrows were an invention of Murugan's grandfather.\"\"Murugan's grandfather,\" said the Rani, \"was a very remarkable man.Remarkably intelligent, but no less remarkably perverse. Great gifts—but,alas, how maleficently used!

And now multiply her into a trinity of undressed obesities, intotwo trinities, ten trinities. Applied Practical Psychology—with a vengeance!\"Yes, False Spirituality,\" the Rani was repeating. \"TalkingaboutLiberation; but always, because of his obstinate refusal tofollow the TruePath, always working for greater Bondage.

Susila pulled up at a small thatchedbungalow like all the others. They climbed the six steps that led up to theveranda and entered a whitewashed living room.To the left was a wide window with a hammock slung between the twowooden pillars at either side of the projecting bay. \"For you,\" she said,pointing to the hammock. \"You can put your leg up.\" And when Will hadlowered himself into the net, \"What shall we talk about?\" she asked as shepulled up a wicker chair and sat down beside him.\"What about the good, the true and the beautiful? Or maybe,\" hegrinned, \"the ugly, the bad and the even truer.\"\"I'd thought,\" she said, ignoring his attempt at a witticism, \"that wemight go on where we left off last time—go on talking about you.\"\"That was precisely what I was suggesting—the ugly, the bad and thetruer than all official truth.\"283\"Is this just an exhibition of your conversational style?\" she asked. \"Ordo you really want to talk about yourself?\"\"Really,\" he assured her, \"desperately. Just as desperately as I don'twant to talk about myself. Hence, as you may have noticed, my unflagginginterest in art, science, philosophy, politics, literature—any damned thingrather than the only thing that ultimately has any importance.\"There was a long silence. Then in a tone of casual reminiscence,Susila began to talk about Wells Cathedral, about the calling of thejackdaws, about the white swans floating between the reflections of the"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"floating clouds. In a few minutes he too was floating.\"I was very happy all the time I was at Wells,\" she said. \"Wonderfullyhappy. And so were you, weren't you?\"Will made no answer. He was remembering those days in the greenvalley, years ago, before he and Molly were married, before they werelovers. What peace! What a solid, living, maggotless world of springinggrass and flowers! And between them had flowed the kind of natural,undistorted feeling that he hadn't experienced since those far-off dayswhen Aunt Mary was alive. The only person he had ever really loved—andhere, in Molly, was her successor. What blessedness! Love transposed intoanother key—but the melody, the rich and subtle harmonies were thesame. And then, on the fourth night of their stay, Molly had knocked on thewall that separated their rooms, and he had found her door ajar, hadgroped his way in darkness to the bed where, conscientiously naked, theSister of Mercy was doing her best to play the part of the Wife of Love.Doing her best and (how disastrously!) failing.Suddenly, as happened almost every afternoon, there was a loudrushing of wind and, muffled by distance, a hollow roaring of rain on thickfoliage—a roaring that grew louder and louder as the shower approached.A few seconds passed, and then the284Islandraindrops were hammering insistently on the windowpanes. Hammering asthey had hammered on the windows of his study that day of their lastinterview. \"Do you really mean it, Will?\"The pain and shame of it made himwant to cry aloud. He bit his lip.\"What are you thinking of?\" Susila asked. It wasn't a matter of thinking.He was actually seeing her, actually hearing her voice. \"Do you really meanit, Will?\" And through the sound of the rain he heard himself answering, \"Ireally mean it.\"On the windowpane—was it here? or was it there, was it then?—theroar had diminished, as the gust spent itself, to a pattering whisper.\"What are you thinking of?\" Susila insisted.\"I'm thinking of what I did to Molly.\"\"What was it that you did to Molly?\"He didn't want to answer; but Susila was inexorable.\"Tell me what it was that you did.\"Another violent gust made the windows rattle. It was raining hardernow—raining, it seemed to Will Farnaby, on purpose, raining in such a way"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"that he would have to go on remembering what he didn't want toremember, would be compelled to say out loud the shameful things hemust at all costs keep to himself.\"Tell me.\"Reluctantly and in spite of himself, he told her.\" 'Do you really mean it, Will?' \" And because of Babs—Babs, Godhelp him! Babs, believe it or not!—he really did mean it, and she hadwalked out into the rain.\"The next time I saw her was in the hospital.\"\"Was it still raining?\" Susila asked.\"Still raining.\"\"As hard as it's raining now?\"\"Very nearly.\" And what Will heard was no longer this after-285noon shower in the tropics but the steady drumming on the window of thelittle room where Molly lay dying.\"It's me,\" he was saying through the sound of the rain, \"it's Will.\"Nothing happened; and then suddenly he felt the almost imperceptiblemovement of Molly's hand within his own. The voluntary pressure and then,after a few seconds, the involuntary release, the total limpness. \"Tell meagain, Will.\"He shook his head. It was too painful, too humiliating. \"Tell me again,\"she insisted. \"It's the only way.\" Making an enormous effort, he started totell the odious story yet once more. Did he really mean it? Yes, he reallymeant it—meant to hurt, meant perhaps (did one ever know what one reallyintended?) to kill. All for Babs, or the World Well Lost. Not his world, ofcourse—Molly's world and, at the center of that world, the life that hadcreated it. Snuffed out for the sake of that delicious smell in the darkness,of those muscular reflexes, that enormity of enjoyment, those consummateand intoxicat-ingly shameless skills.\"Good-bye, Will.\" And the door had closed behind her with a faint, dryclick.He wanted to call her back. But Babs's lover remembered the skills,the reflexes, and within its aura of musk, a body agonizing in the extremityof pleasure. Remembered these things and, standing at the window,watched the car move away through the rain, watched and was filled, as itturned the corner, with a shameful exultation. Free at last! Even freer, as hediscovered three hours later in the hospital, than he had supposed. For"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"now he was feeling the last faint pressure of her fingers; feeling the finalmessage of her love. And then the message was interrupted. The handwent limp and now, suddenly, appallingly, there was no sound of breathing.\"Dead,\" he whispered, and felt himself choking. \"Dead.\"286Island\"Suppose it hadn't been your fault,\" said Susila, breaking a longsilence. \"Suppose that she'd suddenly died without your having hadanything to do with it. Wouldn't that have been almost as bad?\"\"What do you mean?\" he asked.\"I mean, it's more than just feeling guilty about Molly's death. It's deathitself, death as such, that you find so terrible.\" She was thinking of Dugaldnow. \"So senselessly evil.\"\"Senselessly evil,\" he repeated. \"Yes, perhaps that's why I had to be aprofessional execution watcher. Just because it was all so senseless, soutterly bestial. Following the smell of death from one end of the earth to theother. Like a vulture. Nice comfort able people just don't have any ideawhat the world is like. Not exceptionally, as it was during the war, but all thetime. All the time.\" And as he spoke he was seeing, in a vision as brief andcomprehensive and intensely circumstantial as a drowning man's, all thehateful scenes he had witnessed in the course of those well-paidpilgrimages to every hellhole and abattoir revolting enough to qualify asNews. Negroes in South Africa, the man in the San Quentin gas chamber,mangled bodies in an Algerian farmhouse, and everywhere mobs,everywhere policemen and paratroopers, everywhere those dark-skinnedchildren, stick-legged, potbellied, with flies on their raw eyelids, everywherethe nauseating smells of hunger and disease, the awful stench of death.And then suddenly, through the stench of death, mingled and impregnatedwith the stench of death, he was breathing the musky essence of Babs.Breathing the essence of Babs and remembering his little joke about thechemistry of purgatory and paradise. Purgatory is tetraethylene diamineand sulfureted hydrogen; paradise, very definitely, is symtrinitropsibutyltoluene, with an assortment of organic impurities—ha—ha—ha! (Oh, thedelights of social life!) And then, quite suddenly, the odors of love anddeath gave place to a rank animal smell—a smell of dog.287The wind swelled up again into violence and the driving raindrops"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"hammered and splashed against the panes. \"Are you still thinking ofMolly?\" Susila asked. \"I was thinking of something I'd completely forgotten,\"he answered. \"I can't have been more than four years old when ithappened, and now it's all come back to me. Poor Tiger.\" \"Who was poorTiger?\" she questioned. Tiger, his beautiful red setter. Tiger, the onlysource of light in that dismal house where he had spent his childhood.Tiger, dear dear Tiger. In the midst of all that fear and misery, between thetwo poles of his father's sneering hate of everything and everybody and hismother's self-conscious self-sacrifice, what effortless good will, whatspontaneous friendliness, what a bounding, barking irrepressible joy! Hismother used to take himon her knee and tell him about God and Jesus.But there was more God in Tiger than in all her Bible stories. Tiger, so faras he was concerned, was the Incarnation. And then one day theIncarnation came down with distemper. \"What happened then?\" Susilaasked.\"His basket's in the kitchen, and I'mthere, kneeling beside it. And I'mstroking him—but his fur feels quite different fromwhat it felt like before hewas sick. Kind of sticky. And there's a bad smell. If I didn't love him somuch, I'd run away, I couldn't bear to be near him. But I do love him, I lovehimmore than anything or anybody. And while I stroke him, I keep tellinghimthat he'll soon be well again. Very soon—tomorrow morning. And thenall of a sudden he starts to shudder, and I try to stop the shuddering byholding his head between my hands. But it doesn't do any good. Thetrembling turns into a horrible convulsion. It makes me feel sick to look at it,and I'mfrightened. I'm dreadfully frightened. Then the shuddering and thetwitching die down and in a little while he's absolutely still. And when I lifthis head and then let go, the head falls back—thump, like a piece of meatwith a bone inside.\"288IslandWill's voice broke, the tears were streaming down his cheeks, he wasshaken by the sobs of a four-year-old grieving for his dog and confrontedby the awful, inexplicable fact of death. With the mental equivalent of a clickand a little jerk, his consciousness seemed to change gear. He was anadult again, and he hadceased to float.\"I'm sorry.\" He wiped his eyes and blew his nose. \"Well, that was myfirst introduction to the Essential Horror. Tiger was my friend, Tiger was myonly consolation. That was something, obviously, that the Essential Horror"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"couldn't tolerate. And it was the same with my Aunt Mary. The only person Iever really loved and admired and completely trusted; and, Christ, what theEssential Horror did to her!\"\"Tell me,\" said Susila.Will hesitated, then, shrugging his shoulders, \"Why not?\" he said.\"Mary Frances Farnaby, my father's younger sister. Married at eighteen,just a year before the outbreak of the First World War, to a professionalsoldier. Frank and Mary, Mary and Frank—what harmony, whathappiness!\" He laughed. \"Even outside of Pala there one can findoccasional islands of decency. Tiny little atolls, or even, every now andthen, a full-blown Tahiti—but always totally surrounded by the EssentialHorror. Two young people on their private Pala. Then, one fine morning, itwas August 4, 1914, Frank went overseas with the Expeditionary Force,and on Christmas Eve Mary gave birth to a deformed child that survivedlong enough for her to see for herself what the E.H. can do when it reallytries. Only God can make a microcephalous idiot. Three months later,needless to say, Frank was hit by a piece of shrapnel and died in duecourse of gangrene. . . . All that,\" Will went on after a little silence, \"wasbefore my time. When I first knew her, in the twenties, Aunt Mary wasdevoting herself to the aged. Old people in insti tutions, old people coopedup in their own homes, old people living on and on as a burden to theirchildren and grandchildren.289Struldbrugs, Tithonuses. And the more hopeless the decrepitude, themore crotchety and querulous the character, the better. As a child, how Ihated Aunt Mary's old people! They smelt bad, they were frighteningly ugly,they were always boring and generally cross. But Aunt Mary really lovedthem—loved themthrough thick and thin, loved themin spite of everything.My mother used to talk a lot about Christian charity; but somehow onenever believed what she said, just as one never felt any love in all the self-sacrificing things she was always forcing herself to do—-no love, only duty.Whereas with Aunt Mary one was never in the slightest doubt. Her lovewas like a kind of physical radiation, something one could almost sense asheat or light. When she took me to stay with her in the country and later,when she came to town and I used to go and see her almost every day, itwas like escaping from a refrigerator into the sunshine. I could feel myselfcoming alive in that light of hers, that radiating warmth. Then the EssentialHorror got busy again. At the beginning she made a joke of it. 'Now I'man"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Amazon,' she said after the first operation.\"\"Why an Amazon?\" Susila asked.\"The Amazons had their right breast amputated. They were warriorsand the breast got in the way when they were shooting with the long bow.'Now I'man Amazon,' \" he repeated, and with his mind's eye could see thesmile on that strong aquiline face, could hear, with his mind's ear, the toneof amusement in that clear, ringing voice. \"But a few months later the otherbreast had to be cut off. After that there were the X rays, the radiationsickness and then, little by little, the degradation.\" Will's face took on itslook of flayed ferocity. \"If it weren't so unspeakably hideous, it would bereally funny. What a masterpiece of irony! Here was a soul that radiatedgoodness and love and heroic charity. Then, for no known reason,something went wrong. Instead of flouting it, a little piece of her bodystarted to obey the second law of thermodynamics. And as the body broke290Islanddown, the soul began to lose its virtue, its very identity. The heroismwentout of her, the love and the goodness evaporated. For the last months ofher life she was no more the Aunt Mary I had loved and admired; she wassomebody else, somebody (and this was the ironist's final and mostexquisite touch) almost indistinguishable fromthe worst and weakest of theold people she had once befriended and been a tower of strength to. Shehad to be humiliated and degraded; and when the degradation wascomplete, she was slowly, and with a great deal of pain, put to death insolitude. In solitude,\" he insisted. \"For of course nobody can help, nobodycan ever be present. People may stand by while you're suffering and dying;but they're standing by in another world. In your world you're absolutelyalone. Alone in your suffering and your dying, just as you're alone in love,alone even in the most completely shared pleasure.\"The essences of Babs and of Tiger, and when the cancer had gnaweda hole in the liver and her wasted body was impregnated with that strange,aromatic smell of contaminated blood, the essence of Aunt Mary dying.And in the midst of those essences, sickeningly or intoxicatedly aware ofthem, was an isolated consciousness, a child's, a boy's, a man's, foreverisolated, irremediably alone. \"And on top of everything else,\" he went on,\"this woman was only forty-two. She didn't want to die. She refused toaccept what was being done to her. The Essential Horror had to drag herdown by main force. I was there; I saw it happening.\"\"And that's why you're the man who won't take yes for an answer?\""},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"\"How can anyone take yes for an answer?\" he countered. \"Yes is justpretending, just positive thinking. The facts, the basic and ultimate facts,are always no. Spirit? No! Love? No! Sense, meaning, achievement? No!\"Tiger exuberantly alive and joyful and full of God.

Maimed and tortured, dragged in the mud,degraded and finally, like Tiger, transformed into a packet of garbage—onlythis time it was the undertaker who had removed it, and a clergyman washired to make believe that it was all, in some sublime and Pickwickiansense, perfectly O.K. Twenty years later another clergyman had been hiredto repeat the same strange rigmarole over Molly's coffin. \"If after themanner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advan-tageth itme, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.\"Will uttered another of his hyena laughs. \"What impeccable logic, whatsensibility, what ethical refinement!\"\"But you're the man who won't take yes for an answer.

'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.' \" Hescrewed up his face in an expression of disgust.\"And yet,\" said Susila, \"in a certain sense the advice is excellent.Eating, drinking, dying—three primary manifestations of the universal andimpersonal life. Animals live that impersonal and universal life withoutknowing its nature. Ordinary people know its nature but don't live it and, ifever they think seriously about it, refuse to accept it. An enlightened personknows it, lives it, and accepts it completely. He eats, he drinks, and in duecourse he dies—but he eats with a difference, drinks with a difference, dieswith a difference.\"\"And rises again fromthe dead?\" he asked sarcastically. \"That's one ofthe questions the Buddha always refused to discuss.

Perched on one of the pink gazebos, a pair ofmynah birds called indefatigably for attention and compassion. Fromanopen-air kitchen at the center of the square rose the appetizing smell offood on the fire. Onions, peppers, turmeric, fish frying, cakes baking, riceon the boil—and through these good gross odors, like a reminder from theOther Shore, drifted the perfume, thin and sweet and ethereally pure, of themany-colored garlands on sale beside the fountain.Twilight deepened and suddenly, fromhigh overhead, the arc lampswere turned on. Bright and burnished against the rosy copper of oiled skin,the women's necklaces and rings and bracelets came alive with glitteringreflections. Seen in the downward striking light, every contour becamemore dramatic, every form seemed to be more substantial, more solidlythere. In eye sockets, under nose and chin the shadows deepened.Modeled by light and darkness young breasts grew fuller and the faces ofthe old were more emphatically lined and hollowed.Hand in hand they made their way through the crowd.299A middle-aged woman greeted Mary Sarojini, then turned to Will. \"Areyou that man fromthe Outside?\" she asked.\"Almost infinitely fromthe outside,\" he assured her.She looked at himfor a moment in silence, then smiled encouraginglyand patted his cheek.\"We're all very sorry for you,\" she said.They moved on, and now they were standing on the fringes of a groupassembled at the foot of the temple steps to listen to a young man who wasplaying a long-necked, lute-like instrument and singing in Palanese. Rapiddeclamation alternated with long-drawn, almost birdlike melismata on asingle vowel sound, and then a cheerful and strongly accented tune thatended in a shout. A roar of laugher went up fromthe crowd. A few morebars, another line or two of recitative, and the singer struck his final chord.There was applause and more laughter and a chorus of incomprehensiblecommentary.\"What's it all about?\" Will asked.\"It's about girls and boys sleeping together,\" Mary Sarojini answered."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"\"Oh—I see.\" He felt a pang of guilty embarrassment; but, looking downinto the child's untroubled face, he could see that his concern was uncalledfor.

A smell of incense min gled withthe ambient onions and fried fish. An old woman emerged and verycautiously lowered her unsteady weight from stair to stair.\"Who were Paul and Freud?\" Mary Sarojini asked as they movedaway.Will began with a brief account of Original Sin and the Scheme ofRedemption.

He didn't know that the old man washis father. And anyhow the old man began it, hit him over the head, andthat made Oedipus lose his temper—and nobody had ever taught himtodance the Rakshasi Hornpipe. And when they made him a king, he had tomarry the old queen. She was really his mother; but neither of them knewit. And of course all they had to do when they did find out was just to stopbeing married.

He looked around again, thenshook his head. \"No, I can't tell you—not here. That's why you must cometo the bungalow. Now. There's no time to lose.\"Will glanced at his watch. \"No time to lose,\" he echoed and, turning toMary Sarojini, \"We must get going,\" he said. \"Which way?\"\"I'll show you,\" she said, and they set offhand in hand.\"Wait,\" Murugan implored, \"wait!\" Then, as Will and Mary Sarojini heldon their course, he came dodging through the crowd in pursuit. \"What shallI tell her?\" he wailed at their heels.The boy's terror was comically abject. In Will's mind anger gave placeto amusement. He laughed aloud. Then, halting, \"What would you tell her,Mary Sarojini?\" he asked.\"I'd tell her exactly what happened,\" said the child. \"I mean, if it was mymother. But then,\" she added on second thought, \"my mother isn't theRani.\" She looked up at Murugan. \"Do you belong to an MAC?\" sheenquired.Of course he didn't. For the Rani the very idea of a Mutual AdoptionClub was a blasphemy. Only God could make a Mother. The SpiritualCrusader wanted to be alone with her God-given victim.\"No MAC.\" Mary Sarojini shook her head. \"That's awful!311You might have gone and stayed for a few days with one of your othermothers.\"Still terrified by the prospect of having to tell his only mother about the"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"failure of his mission, Murugan began to harp almost hysterically on a newvariant of the old theme. \"I don't know what she'll say,\" he kept repeating. \"Idon't know what she'll say.\"\"There's only one way to find out what she'll say,\" Will told him. \"Gohome and listen.\"\"Come with me,\" Murugan begged. \"Please.\" He clutched at Will's arm.\"I told you not to touch me.\" The clutching hand was hastily withdrawn.Will smiled again. \"That's better!\" He raised his staff in a farewell gesture.\"Bonne nuit, Altesse.\" Then to Mary Sarojini, \"Lead on, MacPhail,\" he saidin high good humor.\"Were you putting it on?\" Mary Sarojini asked. \"Or were you reallyangry?\"\"Really and truly,\" he assured her. Then he remembered what he hadseen in the school gymnasium. He hummed the opening notes of theRakshasi Hornpipe and banged the pavement with his ironshod staff.\"Ought I to have stamped it out?\"\"Maybe it would have been better.\"\"You think so?\"\"He's going to hate you as soon as he's stopped being frightened.\"Will shrugged his shoulders. He couldn't care less. But as the pastreceded and the future approached, as they left the arc lamps of themarketplace and climbed the steep dark street that wound uphill to thehospital, his mood began to change. Lead on, MacPhail—but towardswhat, and away fromwhat? Towards yet another manifestation of theEssential Horror and away fromall hope of that blessed year of freedomwhich Joe Aldehyde had promised and that it would be so easy and (sincePala was312Islanddoomed in any event) not so immoral or treacherous to earn, And not onlyaway from the hope of freedom; away quite possi bly, if the Ranicomplained to Joe and if Joe became sufficiently indignant, from anyfurther prospects of well-paid slavery as a professional execution watcher.Should he turn back, should he try to find Murugan, offer apologies, dowhatever that dreadful woman ordered himto do? A hundred yards up theroad, the lights of the hospital could be seen shining between the trees.\"Let's rest for a moment,\" he said.\"Are you tired?\" Mary Sarojini enquired solicitously.\"A little.\""},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"He turned and, leaning on his staff, looked down at the market place.In the light of the arc lamps the town hall glowed pink, like a monumentalserving of raspberry sherbet. On the temple spire he could see, friezeabove frieze, the exuberant chaos of Indie sculpture—elephants andBodhisattvas, demons, supernat ural girls with breasts and enormousbottoms, capering Shivas, rows of past and future Buddhas in quietecstasy. Below, in the space between sherbet and mythology, seethed thecrowd, and somewhere in that crowd was a sulky face and a pair of whitesatin pajamas. Should he go back? It would be the sensible, the safe, theprudent thing to do. But an inner voice—not little, like the Rani's, butstentorian—shouted, \"Squalid! Squalid!\" Con science? No. Morality?Heaven forbid! But supererogatory squalor, ugliness and vulgarity beyondthe call of duty—these were things which, as a man of taste, one simplycouldn't be a party to.\"Well, shall we go on?\" he said to Mary Sarojini.They entered the lobby of the hospital. The nurse at the desk had amessage for themfromSusila. Mary Sarojini was to go directly to Mrs.Rao's, where she and TomKrishna would spend the night. Mr. Farnabywas to be asked to come at once to Room34.\"This way,\" said the nurse, and held open a swing door.313Will stepped forward. The conditioned reflex of politeness clickedautomatically into action. \"Thank you,\" he said, and smiled. But it was witha dull, sick feeling in the pit of the stomach that he went hobbling towardsthe apprehended future.\"The last door on the left,\" said the nurse. But now she had to get backto her desk in the lobby. \"So I'll leave you to go on alone,\" she added as thedoor closed behind her.Alone, he repeated to himself, alone—and the apprehended future wasidentical with the haunting past, the Essential Horror was timeless andubiquitous. This long corridor with its green-painted walls was the verysame corridor along which, a year ago, he had walked to the little roomwhere Molly lay dying. The nightmare was recurrent. Foredoomed andconscious, he moved on towards its horrible consummation. Death, yetanother vision of death.Thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four . . . He knocked and waited, listeningto the beating of his heart.

Rounding a screen, he caught aglimpse of Susila's profile silhouetted against a lamp, of a high bed, of adark emaciated face on the pillow, of arms that were no more thanparchment-covered bones, of clawlike hands. Once again the EssentialHorror. With a shudder he turned away. Radha motioned himto a chairnear the open window. He sat down and closed his eyes—closed themphysically against the present, but, by that very act, opened them inwardlyupon that hateful past of which the present had reminded him. He wasthere in that other room, with Aunt Mary. Or rather with the person who hadonce been Aunt Mary, but was now this hardly recognizable somebodyelse—somebody who had never so much as heard of the charity andcourage which had been the very essence of Aunt Mary's being; somebodywho was filled with an indiscriminate hatred for all who came near her,loathing314Islandthem, whoever they might be, simply because they didn't have cancer,because they weren't in pain, had not been sentenced to die before theirtime. And along with this malignant envy of other people's health andhappiness had gone a bitterly queru lous self-pity, an abject despair.\"Why to me? Why should this thing have happened to me?\"He could hear the shrill complaining voice, could see that tearstainedand distorted face. The only person he had ever really loved orwholeheartedly admired. And yet, in her degrada tion, he had caughthimself despising her—despising, positively hating.To escape from the past, he reopened his eyes. Radha, he saw, was sittingon the floor, cross-legged and upright, in the posture of meditation. In herchair beside the bed Susila seemed to beholding the same kind of focusedstillness. He looked at the face on the pillow. That too was still, still with aserenity that might almost have been the frozen calmof death. Outside, inthe leafy darkness, a peacock suddenly screamed. Deepened by contrast,the ensuing silence seemed to grow pregnant with mysterious andappalling meanings.\"Lakshmi.\" Susila laid a hand on the old woman's wasted arm.\"Lakshmi,\" she said again more loudly. The death-calm face remainedimpassive. \"You mustn't go to sleep.\"Not go to sleep?

All the time.\" She slipped an additional pillow under the sick woman'sshoulders and reached for a bottle of smelling salts that stood on the bedtable.315Lakshmi sniffed, opened her eyes, and looked up into Susila's face.\"I'd forgotten how beautiful you were,\" she said. \"But then Dugald alwaysdid have good taste.\" The ghost of a mischievous smile appeared for amoment on the fleshless face. \"What do you think, Susila?\" she added aftera moment and in another tone. \"Shall we see himagain? I mean, overthere?\"In silence Susila stroked the old woman's hand. Then, suddenlysmiling, \"How would the Old Raja have asked that question?\" she said. \"Doyou think 'we' (quote, unquote) shall see 'him' (quote, unquote) 'over there'(quote, unquote) ?\"\"But what do you think?\"\"I think we've all come out of the same light, and we're all going backinto the same light.\"Words, Will was thinking, words, words, words. With an effort, Lakshmilifted a hand and pointed accusingly at the lamp on the bed table.\"It glares in my eyes,\" she whispered.Susila untied the red silk handkerchief knotted around her throat anddraped it over the lamp's parchment shade. Fromwhite and mercilesslyrevealing, the light became as dimly, warmly rosy as the flush, Will foundhimself thinking, on Babs's rumpled bed, whenever Porter's Gin proclaimeditself in crimson.\"That's much better,\" said Lakshmi. She shut her eyes. Then, after along silence, \"The light,\" she broke out, \"the light. It's here again.\" Thenafter another pause, \"Oh, how wonderful,\" she whispered at last, \"howwonderful!\" Suddenly she winced and bit her lip.Susila took the old woman's hand in both of hers. \"Is the pain bad?\"she asked."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"\"It would be bad,\" Lakshmi explained, \"if it were really my pain.

It went away when I started talking about the pain notbeing really mine.\"\"And yet what you were saying was good.\"\"I know—but I was saying it.\" The ghost of an old habit of irreverentmischief flitted once again across Lakshmi's face.\"What are you thinking of?\" Susila asked.\"Socrates.\"\"Socrates?\"\"Gibber, gibber, gibber—even when he'd actually swallowed the stuff.Don't let me talk, Susila. Help me to get out of my own light.\"\"Do you remember that time last year,\" Susila began after a silence,\"when we all went up to the old Shiva temple above the High AltitudeStation? You and Robert and Dugald and me and the two children—do youremember?\"Lakshmi smiled with pleasure at the recollection.\"I'm thinking specially of that view from the west side of the temple—the view out over the sea. Blue, green, purple—and the shadows of theclouds were like ink. And the clouds themselves—snow, lead, charcoal,satin. And while we were looking, you asked a question. Do you remember,Lakshmi?\"\"You mean, about the Clear Light?\"\"About the Clear Light,\" Susila confirmed. \"Why do people speak ofMind in terms of Light? Is it because they've seen the sunshine and found itso beautiful that it seems only natural to identify the Buddha Nature withthe clearest of all possible Clear Lights? Or do they find the sunshinebeautiful because, consciously or unconsciously, they've been havingrevelations of Mind in the form of Light ever since they were born? I wasthe first to answer,\" said Susila, smiling to herself. \"And as I'd just beenreading something by some American behaviorist, I didn't stop to think—Ijust gave you the (quote, unquote) 'scientific point of view.' People equateMind (whatever that may be) with"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"317hallucinations of light, because they've looked at a lot of sunsets and foundthemvery impressive. But Robert and Dugald would have none of it. TheClear Light, they insisted, comes first. You go mad about sunsets becausesunsets remind you of what's always been going on, whether you knew it ornot, inside your skull and outside space and time. You agreed with them,Lakshmi—do you remember? You said, 'I'd like to be on your side, Susila, ifonly because it isn't good for these men of ours to be right all the time. Butin this case—surely it's pretty obvious—in this case they are right.' Ofcourse they were right, and of course I was hopelessly wrong. And,needless to say, you had known the right answer before you asked thequestion.\"\"I never knew anything,\" Lakshmi whispered. \"I could only see.'\"\"I remember your telling me about seeing the Clear Light,\" said Susila.\"Would you like me to remind you of it?\"The sick woman nodded her head.\"When you were eight years old,\" said Susila. \"That was the first time.An orange butterfly on a leaf, opening and shutting its wings in thesunshine—and suddenly there was the Clear Light of pure Suchnessblazing through it, like another sun.\"\"Much brighter than the sun,\" Lakshmi whispered.\"But much gentler. You can look into the Clear Light and not beblinded. And now remember it. A butterfly on a green leaf, opening andshutting its wings—and it's the Buddha Nature totally present, it's the ClearLight outshining the sun. And you were only eight years old.\"\"What had I done to deserve it?\"Will found himself remembering that evening, a week or so before herdeath, when Aunt Mary had talked about the wonderful times they had hadtogether in her little Regency house near Arundel where he had spent thebetter part of all his holidays. Smoking out the wasps' nests with fire andbrimstone, having picnics on the downs or under the beeches. And then the318Islandsausage rolls at Bognor, the gypsy fortuneteller who had proph esied thathe would end up as Chancellor of the Exchequer, the black-robed, red-nosed verger who had chased them out of Chichester Cathedral becausethey had laughed too much. \"Laughed too much,\" Aunt Mary had repeated"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"bitterly. \"Laughed too much ...\"\"And now,\" Susila was saying, \"think of that view fromthe Shivatemple. Think of those lights and shadows on the sea, those blue spacesbetween the clouds. Think of them, and then let go of your thinking. Let goof it, so that the not-Thought can come through. Things into Emptiness.Emptiness into Suchness. Suchness into things again, into your own mind.Remember what it says in the Sutra. 'Your own consciousness shining,void, inseparable from the great Body of Radiance, is subject neither tobirth nor death, but is the same as the immutable Light, Bud dha Amitabha.'\"\"The same as the light,\" Lakshmi repeated. \"And yet it's all dark again.\"\"It's dark because you're trying too hard,\" said Susila. \"Dark becauseyou want it to be light. Remember what you used to tell me when I was alittle girl. 'Lightly, child, lightly. You've got to learn to do everything lightly.Think lightly, act lightly, feel lightly. Yes, feel lightly, even though you'refeeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.' Iwas so preposterously serious in those days, such a humorless little prig.Lightly, lightly—it was the best advice ever given me. Well, now I'mgoing tosay the same thing to you, Lakshmi . . . Lightly, my darling, lightly. Evenwhen it comes to dying. Nothing ponderous, or portentous, or emphatic. Norhetoric, no tremolos, no self-conscious persona putting on its celebratedimitation of Christ or Goethe or Little Nell. And, of course, no theology, nometaphysics. Just the fact of dying and the fact of the Clear Light. So throwaway all your baggage and go forward. There are quicksands all about you,sucking at your feet, trying to suck319you down into fear and self-pity and despair. That's why you must walk solightly. Lightly, my darling. On tiptoes; and no luggage, not even a spongebag. Completely unencumbered.\"Completely unencumbered . . . Will thought of poor Aunt Mary sinkingdeeper and deeper with every step into the quicksands. Deeper and deeperuntil, struggling and protesting to the last, she had gone down, completelyand forever, into the Essential Horror. He looked again at the fleshless faceon the pillow and saw that it was smiling.\"The Light,\" came the hoarse whisper, \"the Clear Light. It's here—along with the pain, in spite of the pain.\"\"And where are youV Susila asked.\"Over there, in the corner.\" Lakshmi tried to point, but the raised hand"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"faltered and fell back, inert, on the coverlet. \"I can see myself there. Andshe can see my body on the bed.\"\"Can she see the Light?\"\"No. The Light's here, where my body is.\"The door of the sickroomwas quietly opened. Will turned his head andwas in time to see Dr. Robert's small spare figure emerging from behind thescreen into the rosy twilight.Susila rose and motioned himto her place beside the bed. Dr. Robertsat down and, leaning forward, took his wife's hand in one of his and laidthe other on her forehead.\"It's me,\" he whispered.\"At last. . .\"A tree, he explained, had fallen across the telephone line. Nocommunication with the High Altitude Station except by road. They hadsent a messenger in a car, and the car had broken down.

Me and the pain, me and the Light, me andyou—all together.\"The peacock screamed again and, through the insect noises that inthis tropical night were the equivalent of silence, far off but clear came thesound of gay music, flutes and plucked strings and the steady throbbing ofdrums.\"Listen,\" said Dr. Robert. \"Can you hear it? They're dancing.\"\"Dancing,\" Lakshmi repeated. \"Dancing.\"\"Dancing so lightly,\" Susila whispered. \"As though they had wings.\"The music swelled up again into audibility."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"\"It's the Courting Dance,\" Susila went on.\"The Courting Dance. Robert, do you remember?\"\"Could I ever forget?\"Yes, Will said to himself, could one ever forget? Could one ever forgetthat other distant music and, nearby, unnaturally quick and shallow, thesound of dying breath in a boy's ears? In the house across the streetsomebody was practicing one of those Brahms Waltzes that Aunt Mary hadloved to play. One-two and three and One-two and three and O-o-o-ne twothree, One- and One and Two-Three and One and . . . The odious strangerwho had once been Aunt Mary stirred out of her artificial stupor and openedher eyes. An expression of the most intense malignity had appeared on theyellow, wasted face. \"Go and tell them to stop,\" the harsh, unrecognizablevoice had almost screamed. And then the lines of malignity had changedinto the lines of despair, and the stranger, the pitiable odious strangerstarted321to sob uncontrollably. Those Brahms Waltzes—they were the pieces, out ofall her repertory, that Frank had loved best.Another gust of cool air brought with it a louder strain of thegay, bright music.\"All those young people dancing together,\" said Dr. Robert. \"All thatlaughter and desire, all that uncomplicated happiness! It's all here, like anatmosphere, like a field of force. Their joy and our love—Susila's love, mylove—all working together, all reinforcing one another. Love and joyenveloping you, my darling; love and joy carrying you up into the peace ofthe Clear Light. Listen to the music. Can you still hear it, Lakshmi?\"\"She's drifted away again,\" said Susila. \"Try to bring herback.\"Dr. Robert slipped an armunder the emaciated body and lifted it into asitting posture. The head drooped sideways ontohis shoulder.\"My little love,\" he kept whispering. \"My little love . . .\"Her eyelids fluttered open for a moment. \"Brighter,\" came the barelyaudible whisper, \"brighter.\" And a smile of happiness intense almost to thepoint of elation transfigured her face.Through his tears Dr. Robert smiled back at her. \"So now you can letgo, my darling.\" He stroked her gray hair. \"Now you can let go.

Leave it here, your old worn-out body, and go on. Go on, mydarling, go on into the Light, into the peace, into the living peace of theClear Light ...\"Susila picked up one of the limp hands and kissed it, then turned tolittle Radha.\"Time to go,\" she whispered, touching the girl's shoulder.322IslandInterrupted in her meditation, Radha opened her eyes, not) ded and,scrambling to her feet, tiptoed silently towards the door. Susila beckoned toWill and, together, they followed her. In silence the three of them walkedalong the corridor. At the swing door Radha took her leave.\"Thank you for letting me be with you,\" she whispered.Susila kissed her. \"Thank you for helping to make it easier forLakshmi.\"Will followed Susila across the lobby and out into the warmodorousdarkness. In silence they started to walk downhill towards the marketplace.\"And now,\" he said at last, speaking under a strange compul sion todeny his emotion in a display of the cheapest kind of cynicism, \"I supposeshe's trotting off to do a little maithunn with her boy friend.\"\"As a matter of fact,\" said Susila calmly, \"she's on night duty. But if sheweren't, what would be the objection to her going on fromthe yoga of deathto the yoga of love?\"Will did not answer immediately.

We'll have to see if we can exorcise it.\"They had crossed the marketplace and now, at the end of the shortstreet that led out of the village, they had come to the open space wherethe jeep was parked.

And then beyond the beyond, back to where you startedfrom—back to here, back to New Rothamsted, back to business as usual.Only now, of course, business as usual is completely different.\"325One, two, three, four ... the clock in the kitchen struck twelve. Howirrelevantly, seeing that time had ceased to exist! The absurd, importunatebell had sounded at the heart of a timelessly present Event, of a Now thatchanged incessantly in a dimension, not of seconds and minutes, but ofbeauty, of significance, of intensity, of deepening mystery.\"Luminous bliss.\" Fromthe shallows of his mind the words rose likebubbles, came to the surface, and vanished into the infinite spaces of livinglight that now pulsed and breathed behind his closed eyelids. \"Luminousbliss.\" That was as near as one could come to it. But it—this timeless andyet ever-changing Event—was something that words could only caricatureand diminish, never convey. It was not only bliss, it was alsounderstanding. Understanding of everything, but without knowledge ofanything. Knowledge involved a knower and all the infinite diversity ofknown and knowable things. But here, behind his closed lids, there wasneither spectacle nor spectator. There was only this experienced fact ofbeing blissfully one with Oneness.In a succession of revelations, the light grew brighter, theunderstanding deepened, the bliss became more impossibly,326Islandmore unbearably intense. \"Dear God!\" he said to himself. \"Oh, my dearGod.\" Then, out of another world, he heard the sound of Susila's voice.\"Do you feel like telling me what's happening?\"It was a long time before Will answered her. Speaking was difficult. Notbecause there was any physical impediment. It was just that speechseemed so fatuous, so totally pointless. \"Light,\" he whispered at last.\"And you're there, looking at the light?\"\"Not looking at it,\" he answered, after a long reflective pause. \"Being it.Being it,\" he repeated emphatically.Its presence was his absence. William Asquith Farnaby—ultimatelyand essentially there was no such person. Ultimately and essentially therewas only a luminous bliss, only a knowledgeless understanding, only unionwith unity in a limitless, undifferenti-ated awareness. This, self-evidently,"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"was the mind's natural state. But no less certainly there had also been thatprofessional execution watcher, that self-loathing Babs addict; there werealso three thousand millions of insulated consciousnesses, each at thecenter of a nightmare world, in which it was impossible for anyone witheyes in his head or a grain of honesty to take yes for an answer. By whatsinister miracle had the mind's natural state been transformed into all theseDevil's Islands of wretchedness and delinquency?In the firmament of bliss and understanding, like bats against thesunset, there was a wild crisscrossing of remembered notions and thehangovers of past feelings. Bat-thoughts of Plotinus and the Gnostics, ofthe One and its emanations, down, down into thickening horror. And thenbat-feelings of anger and disgust as the thickening horrors became specificmemories of what the essentially nonexistent WilliamAsquith Farnaby hadseen and done, inflicted and suffered.But behind and around and somehow even within those flickeringmemories was the firmament of bliss and peace and327understanding. There might be a few bats in the sunset sky; but the factremained that the dreadful miracle of creation had been reversed. Fromapreternaturally wretched and delinquent self he had been unmade into puremind, mind in its natural state, limitless, undifferentiated, luminouslyblissful, knowledgelessly understanding.Light here, light now. And because it was infinitely here and timelesslynow, there was nobody outside the light to look at the light. The fact wasthe awareness, the awareness the fact.From that other world, somewhere out there to the right, came thesound once more of Susila's voice.\"Are you feeling happy?\" she asked.A surge of brighter radiance swept away all those flickering thoughtsand memories.

Poured upwards from union into completer union,fromimpersonality into a yet more absolute transcendence of selfhood.\"God-the-Fourteenth-of-July,\" he repeated and, from the heart of thecataract, gave vent to a final chuckle of recognition and understanding.\"What about the fifteenth of July?\" Susila questioned. \"What about themorning after?\"\"There isn't any morning after.\"328IslandShe shook her head. \"It sounds suspiciously like Nirvana.\"\"What's wrong with that?\"\"Pure Spirit, one hundred percent proof—that's a drink that only themost hardened contemplation guzzlers indulge in. Bo dhisattvas dilute theirNirvana with equal parts of love and work.\"\"This is better,\" Will insisted.\"You mean, it's more delicious. That's why it's such an enor moustemptation. The only temptation that God could succumb to. The fruit of theignorance of good and evil. What heavenly lusciousness, what asupermango! God had been stuffing Himself with it for billions of years.Then all of a sudden, up comes Homo sapiens, out pops the knowledge ofgood and evil. God had to switch to a much less palatable brand of fruit.You've just eaten a slice of the original supermango, so you cansympathize with Him.\"A chair creaked, there was a rustle of skirts, then a series of smallbusy sounds that he was unable to interpret. What was she doing? Hecould have answered that question by simply opening his eyes. But whocared, after all, what she might be doing? Nothing was of any importanceexcept this blazing uprush of bliss and understanding.\"Supermango to fruit of knowledge—I'mgoing to wean you,\" she said,\"by easy stages.\"There was a whirring sound. From the shallows, a bubble ofrecognition reached the surface of consciousness. Susila had been puttinga record on the turntable of a phonograph and now the machine was inmotion.\"Johann Sebastian Bach,\" he heard her saying. \"The music that'sclosest to silence, closest, in spite of its being so highly organized, to pure,"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"hundred percent proof Spirit.\"The whirring gave place to musical sounds. Another bubble ofrecognition came shooting up; he was listening to the Fourth BrandenburgConcerto.It was the same, of course, as the Fourth Brandenburg he had329listened to so often in the past—the same and yet completely different. ThisAllegro—he knew it by heart. Which meant that he was in the best possibleposition to realize that he had never really heard it before. To begin with, itwas no longer he, William Asquith Farnaby, who was hearing it. TheAllegro was revealing itself as an element in the great present Event, amanifestation at one remove of the luminous bliss. Or perhaps that wasputting it too mildly. In another modality this Allegro was the luminous bliss;it was the knowledgeless understanding of everything apprehendedthrough a particular piece of knowledge; it was undifferentiated awarenessbroken up into notes and phrases and yet still all-comprehendingly itself.And of course all this belonged to nobody. It was at once in here, out there,and nowhere. The music which, as WilliamAsquith Farnaby, he had hearda hundred times before, he had been reborn as an unowned awareness.Which was why he was now hearing it for the first time. Unowned, theFourth Brandenburg had an intensity of beauty, a depth of intrinsicmeaning, incomparably greater than anything he had ever found in thesame music when it was his private property.\"Poor idiot\" came up in a bubble of ironic comment. The poor idiothadn't wanted to take yes for an answer in any field but the aesthetic. Andall the time he had been denying, by the mere fact of being himself, all thebeauty and meaning he so passionately longed to say yes to. WilliamAsquith Farnaby was nothing but a muddy filter, on the hither side of whichhuman beings, nature, and even his beloved art had emerged bedimmedand bemired, less, other and uglier than themselves. Tonight, for the firsttime, his awareness of a piece of music was completely unobstructed.Between mind and sound, mind and pattern, mind and significance, therewas no longer any babel of biographical irrelevances to drown the music ormake a senseless discord. Tonight's Fourth Brandenburg was a puredatum—no, a blessed donum—uncorrupted by the personal history, thesec-330Island"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"ondhand notions, the ingrained stupidities with which, like every self, thepoor idiot, who wouldn't (and in art plainly couldn't) take yes for an answer,had overlaid the gifts of immediate experience.And tonight's Fourth Brandenburg was not merely an unowned Thingin Itself; it was also, in some impossible way, a Present Event with aninfinite duration. Or rather (and still more impossibly, seeing that it hadthree movements and was being played at its usual speed) it was withoutduration. The metronome presided over each of its phrases; but the sum ofits phrases was not a span of seconds and minutes. There was a tempo,but no time. So what was there?\"Eternity,\" Will was forced to answer. It was one of those metaphysicaldirty words which no decent-minded man would dreamof pronouncingeven to himself, much less in public. \"Eternity, my brethren,\" he said aloud.\"Eternity, blah-blah.\" The sarcasm, as he might have known it would, fellcompletely flat. Tonight those four syllables were no less concretelysignificant than the four letters of the other class of tabooed words. Hebegan to laugh.\"What's so funny?\" she asked.\"Eternity,\" he answered. \"Believe it or not, it's as real as shit.\"\"Excellent!\" she said approvingly.He sat there motionlessly attentive, following with ear and inward eyethe interwoven streams of sound, the interwoven streams of congruous andequivalent lights, that flowed on time-lessly fromone sequence to another.And every phrase of this well-worn familiar music was an unprecedentedrevelation of beauty that went pouring upwards, like a multitudinousfountain, into another revelation as novel and amazing as itself. Streamwithin stream—the streamof the solo violin, the streams of the tworecorders, the manifold streams of the harpsichord and the little orchestraof assorted strings. Separate, distinct,331individual—and yet each of the streams was a function of all the rest, eachwas itself in virtue of its relationship to the whole of which it was acomponent.''Dear God!\" he heard himself whispering.In the timeless sequence of change the recorders were holding asingle long-drawn note. A note without upper partials, clear, pellucid,divinely empty. A note (the word came bubbling up) of pure contemplation."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"And here was another inspirational obscenity that had now acquired aconcrete meaning and might be uttered without a sense of shame. Purecontemplation, unconcerned, beyond contingency, outside the context ofmoral judgments. Through the uprushing lights he caught a glimpse, inmemory, of Radha's shining face as she talked of love as contemplation, ofRadha once again, sitting cross-legged, in a focused intensity of stillness,at the foot of the bed where Lakshmi lay dying. This long pure note was themeaning of her words, the audible expression of her silence. But, always,flowing through and along with the heavenly emptiness of thatcontemplative fluting was the rich sound, vibration within passionatevibration, of the violin. And surrounding them both—the notes ofcontemplative detachment and the notes of passionate involvement—wasthis network of sharp dry tones plucked fromthe wires of the harpsichord.Spirit and instinct, action and vision—and around themthe web of intellect.They were comprehended by discursive thought, but comprehended, it wasobvious, only fromthe outside, in terms of an order of experience radicallydifferent from that which discursive thinking professes to explain.\"It's like a Logical Positivist,\" he said.\"What is?\"\"That harpsichord.\"Like a Logical Positivist, he was thinking in the shallows of his mind,while in the depths the great Event of light and sound tunelessly unfolded.Like a Logical Positivist talking about Ploti-nus and Julie de Lespinasse.332IslandThe music changed again, and now it was the violin that sus tained(how passionately!) the long-drawn note of contempla tion, while the tworecorders took up the theme of active involvement and repeated it—theidentical form imposed upon another substance—in the mode ofdetachment. And here, dancing in and out between them, was the LogicalPositivist, absurd but indispensable, trying to explain, in a languageincommensurable with the facts, what is was all about.In the Eternity that was as real as shit, he went on listening to theseinterwoven streams of sound, went on looking at these interwoven streamsof light, went on actually being (out there, in here, and nowhere) all that hesaw and heard. And now, abruptly, the character of the light underwent achange. These interwoven streams, which were the first fluiddifferentiations of an understanding on the further side of all particularknowledge, had ceased to be a continuum. Instead, there was, all of asudden, this endless succession of separate forms—forms still manifestly"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"charged with the luminous bliss of undifferentiated being, but limited now,isolated, individualized. Silver and rose, yellow and pale green and gentianblue, an endless succession of luminous spheres came swimming up fromsome hidden source of forms and, in time with the music, purposefullyconstellated themselves into arrays of unbelievable complexity and beauty.An inexhaustible fountain that sprayed out into conscious pattern-ings, intolattices of living stars. And as he looked at them, as he lived their life andthe life of this music that was their equivalent, they went on growing intoother lattices that filled the three dimensions of an inner space andchanged incessantly in another, timeless dimension of quality andsignificance.\"What are you hearing?\" Susila asked.\"Hearing what I see,\" he answered. \"And seeing what I hear.\"\"And how would you describe it?\"\"What it looks like,\" Will answered, after a long silence,333\"what it sounds like, is the creation. Only it's not a one-shot affair. It'snonstop, perpetual creation.\"\"Perpetual creation out of no-what nowhere into somethingsomewhere—is that it?\"\"That's it.\"\"You're making progress.\"If words had come more easily and, when spoken, had been a littleless pointless, Will would have explained to her that knowl-edgelessunderstanding and luminous bliss were a damn sight better than evenJohann Sebastian Bach.\"Making progress,\" Susila repeated. \"But you've still got a long way togo. What about opening your eyes?\"Will shook his head emphatically.\"It's time you gave yourself a chance of discovering what's what.\"\"What's what is this\" he muttered.\"It isn't,\" she assured him. \"All you've been seeing and hearing andbeing is only the first what. Now you must look at the second one. Look,and then bring the two together into a single inclusive what's-what. So openyour eyes, Will. Open them wide.\"\"All right,\" he said at last and reluctantly, with an apprehensive senseof impending misfortune, he opened his eyes. The inner illumination wasswallowed up in another kind of light. The fountain of forms, the colored"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"orbs in their conscious arrays and purposefully changing lattices gaveplace to a static composition of uprights and diagonals, of flat planes andcurving cylinders, all carved out of some material that looked like livingagate, and all emerging froma matrix of living and pulsating mother-of-pearl. Like a blind man newly healed and confronted for the first time by themystery of light and color, he stared in uncomprehending astonishment.And then, at the end of another twenty timeless bars of the FourthBrandenburg, a bubble of334Islandexplanation rose into consciousness. He was looking, Will suddenlyperceived, at a small square table, and beyond the table at a rocking chair,and beyond the rocking chair at a blank wall of whitewashed plaster. Theexplanation was reassuring for in the eternity that he had experiencedbetween the opening of his eyes and the emergent knowledge of what hewas looking at, the mystery confronting himhad deepened frominexplicable beauty to a consummation of shining alienness that filled him,as he looked, with a kind of metaphysical terror. Well, this terrifying mysteryconsisted of nothing but two pieces of furniture and an expanse of wall. Thefear was allayed, but the wonder only increased. How was it possible thatthings so familiar and commonplace could be this? Obviously it wasn'tpossible; and yet there it was, there it was.His attention shifted from the geometrical constructions in brown agateto their pearly background. Its name, he knew, was \"wall\"; but inexperienced fact it was a living process, a continuing series oftransubstantiations fromplaster and whitewash into the stuff of asupernatural body—into a god-flesh that kept modulating, as he looked atit, from glory to glory. Out of what the word bubbles had tried to explainaway as mere calcimine some shaping spirit was evoking an endlesssuccession of the most delicately discriminated hues, at once faint andintense, that emerged out of latency and went flushing across the god-body's divinely radiant skin. Wonderful, wonderful! And there must be othermiracles, new worlds to conquer and be conquered by. He turned his headto the left and there (appropriate words had bubbled up almostimmediately) was the large marble-topped table at which they had eatentheir supper. And now, thick and fast, more bubbles began to rise. Thisbreathing apocalypse called \"table\" might be thought of as a picture bysome mystical Cubist, some inspired Juan Gris with the soul of Traherneand a gift for painting miracles with conscious gems and the changing"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"moods of water-lily petals.335Turning his head a little further to the left he was startled by .1 blaze ofjewelry. And what strange jewelry! Narrow slabs of emerald and topaz, ofruby and sapphire and lapis lazuli, blazing away, row above row, like somany bricks in a wall of the New Jerusalem. Then—at the end, not in thebeginning—came the word, in the beginning were the jewels, the stained-glass windows, the walls of paradise. It was only now, at long last, that theword \"bookcase\" presented itself for consideration.Will raised his eyes fromthe book-jewels and found himself at theheart of a tropical landscape. Why? Where? Then he remembered that,when (in another life) he first entered the room, he had noticed, over thebookcase, a large, bad water color. Between sand dunes and clumps ofpalms a widening estuary receding towards the open sea, and above thehorizon enormous mountains of cloud towered into a pale sky. \"Feeble,\"came bubbling up from the shallows. The work, only too obviously, of a notvery gifted amateur. But that was now beside the point, for the landscapehad ceased to be a painting and was now the subject of the painting—areal river, real sea, real sand glaring in the sunshine, real trees against areal sky. Real to the nth, real to the point of absoluteness. And this realriver mingling with a real sea was his own being engulfed in God. \" 'God'between quotation marks?\" enquired an ironical bubble. \"Or God (!) in amodernist, Pickwickian sense?\" Will shook his head. The answer was justplain God—the God one couldn't possibly believe in, but who was self-evidently the fact confronting him. And yet this river was still a river, thissea the Indian Ocean. Not something else in fancy dress. Unequivocallythemselves. But at the same time unequivocally God.\"Where are you now?\" Susila asked.Without turning his head in her direction, Will answered, \"In heaven, Isuppose,\" and pointed at the landscape.\"In heaven—still? When are you going to make a landing down here?\"336IslandAnother bubble of memory came up fromthe silted shallows. \"'Something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light'—ofsomething or other.\"\"But Wordsworth also talked about the still sad music of humanity.\""},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"\"Luckily,\" said Will, \"there are no humans in this landscape.\"\"Not even any animals,\" she added, with a little laugh. \"Only cloudsand the most deceptively innocent-looking vegetables. That's why you'dbetter look at what's on the floor.\"Will dropped his eyes. The grain on the floorboards was a brown river,and the brown river was an eddying, ongoing diagramof the world's divinelife. At the center of that diagramwas his own right foot, bare under thestraps of its sandal, and star-tlingly three-dimensional, like the marble foot,revealed by a searchlight, of some heroic statue. \"Boards,\" \"grain,\" \"foot\"—through the glib explanatory words the mystery stared back at him,impenetrable and yet, paradoxically, understood. Understood with thatknowledgeless understanding to which, in spite of sensed objects andremembered names, he was still open.Suddenly, out of the tail of his eye, he caught a glimpse of quick,darting movement. Openness to bliss and understanding was also, herealized, an openness to terror, to total incomprehension. Like some aliencreature lodged within his chest and struggling in anguish, his heart startedto beat with a violence that made him tremble. In the hideous certainty thathe was about to meet the Essential Horror, Will turned his head andlooked.\"It's one of TomKrishna's pet lizards,\" she said reassuringly.The light was as bright as ever; but the brightness had changed itssign. A glow of sheer evil radiated from every gray-green scale of thecreature's back, fromits obsidian eyes and the pulsing of its crimson throat,fromthe armored edges of its nostrils and its slitlike mouth. He turnedaway. In vain. The Essential Horror glared out of everything he looked at.Those337compositions by the mystical Cubist—they had turned into intricatemachines for doing nothing malevolently. That tropical landscape, in whichhe had experienced the union of his own being with the being of God—itwas now simultaneously the most nauseating of Victorian oleographs andthe actuality of hell. On their shelves, the rows of book-jewels beamed witha thousand watts of darkness visible. And how cheap these gems of theabyss had become, how indescribably vulgar! Where there had been goldand pearl and precious stones there were only Christmas-tree decorations,only the shallow glare of plastic and varnished tin. Everything still pulsedwith life, but with the life of an infinitely sinister bargain basement. And that,"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"the music now affirmed, that was what Omnipotence was perpetuallycreating—a cosmic Woolworth stocked with mass-produced horrors.Horrors of vulgarity and horrors of pain, of cruelty and tastelessness, ofimbecility and deliberate malice.\"Not a gecko,\" he heard Susila saying, \"not one of our nice little houselizards. A hulking stranger fromoutdoors, one of the bloodsuckers. Not thatthey suck blood, of course. They merely have red throats and go purple inthe face when they get excited. Hence that stupid name. Look! There hegoes!\"Will looked down again. Preternaturally real, the scaly horror with itsblack blank eyes, its murderer's mouth, its blood-red throat pumping awaywhile the rest of the body lay stretched along the floor as still as death, wasnow within six inches of his foot.\"He's seen his dinner,\" said Susila. \"Look over there to your left, on theedge of the matting.\"He turned his head.\"Gongylus gongyloides\" she went on. \"Do you remember?\"Yes, he remembered. The praying mantis that had settled on his bed.But that was in another existence. What he had seen then was merely arather odd-looking insect. What he saw now was a pair of inch-longmonsters, exquisitely grisly, in the act of338Islandcoupling. Their bluish pallor was barred and veined with pink, and thewings that fluttered continuously, like petals in a breeze, were shaded atthe edges with deepening violet. A mimicry of flowers. But the insect formswere undisguisable. And now even the flowery colors had undergone achange. Those quivering wings were the appendages of two brightlyenameled gadgets in the bargain basement, two little working models of anightmare, two miniaturized machines for copulation. And now one of thenightmare machines, the female, had turned the small flat head, all mouthand bulging eyes, at the end of its long neck—had turned it and (dear God!)had begun to devour the head of the male machine. First a purple eye waschewed out, then half the bluish face. What was left of the head fell to theground. Unrestrained by the weight of the eyes and jaws, the severed neckwaved wildly. The female machine snapped at the oozing stump, caught itand, while the headless male uninterruptedly kept up his parody of Ares inthe arms of Aphrodite, methodically chewed.Out of the corner of his eye Will glimpsed another spurt of movement,"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"turned his head sharply, and was in time to see the lizard crawling towardshis foot. Nearer, nearer. He averted his eyes in terror. Something touchedhis toes and went tickling across his instep. The tickling ceased; but hecould sense a little weight on his foot, a dry scaly contact. He wanted toscream; but his voice was gone and, when he tried to move, his musclesrefused to obey him.Tunelessly the music had turned into the final Presto. Horror briskly onthe march, horror in rococo fancy dress leading the dance.Utterly still, except for the pulse in its red throat, the scaly horror on hisinstep lay staring with expressionless eyes at its predestined prey.Interlocked, the two little working models of a nightmare quivered likewindblown petals and were shaken spasmodically by the simultaneousagonies of death and copula-339tion. A timeless century passed; bar after bar, the gay little dance of deathwent on and on. Suddenly there was a scrabbling against his skin of tinyclaws. The bloodsucker had crawled down from his instep to the floor. Fora long life-span it lay there absolutely still. Then, with incredible speed, itdarted across the boards and onto the matting. The slitlike mouth openedand closed again. Protruding from between the champing jaws, the edge ofa violet-tinted wing still fluttered, like an orchid petal in the breeze; a pair oflegs waved wildly for a moment, then disappeared fromview.Will shuddered and closed his eyes; but across the frontier betweenthings sensed and things remembered, things imagined, the horror pursuedhim. In the fluorescent glare of the inner light an endless column of tin-bright insects and gleaming reptiles marched up diagonally, fromleft toright, out of some hidden source of nightmare towards an unknown andmonstrous consummation. Gongylus gongyloides by millions and, in themidst of them, innumerable bloodsuckers. Eating and being eaten—forever.And all the while—fiddle, flute and harpsichord—the final Presto of theFourth Brandenburg kept trotting timelessly forward. What a jolly littlerococo death march! Left, right; left, right. . . But what was the word ofcommand for hexapods? And suddenly they weren't hexapods any longer;they were bipeds. The endless column of insects had turned abruptly intoan endless column of soldiers. Marching as he had seen the Brown Shirtsmarching through Berlin, a year before the war. Thousands uponthousands of them, their banners fluttering, their uniforms glowing in the"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"infernal brightness like floodlit excrement. Numberless as insects, and eachof them moving with the precision of a machine, the perfect docility of aperforming dog. And the faces, the faces! He had seen the close-ups onthe German newsreel, and here they were again, preternatu-rally real andthree-dimensional and alive. The monstrous face of340IslandHitler with his mouth open, yelling. And then the faces of assortedlisteners. Huge idiot faces, blankly receptive. Faces of wide-eyedsleepwalkers. Faces of young Nordic angels rapt in the Beatific Vision.Faces of baroque saints going into ecstasy. Faces of lovers on the brink oforgasm. One Folk, One Realm, One Leader. Union with the unity of aninsect swarm. Knowledgeless understanding of nonsense and diabolism.And then the news reel camera had cut back to the serried ranks, theswastikas, the brass bands, the yelling hypnotist on the rostrum. And hereonce again, in the glare of his inner light, was the brown insectlike column,marching endlessly to the tunes of this rococo horror music. Onward Nazisoldiers. Onward Marxists. Onward Chris tian soldiers, and Muslims.Onward every chosen people, every Crusader and Holy War maker.Onward into misery, into all wickedness, into death. And suddenly Willfound himself looking at what the marching column would become when ithad reached its destination—thousands of corpses in the Korean mud,innumerable packets of garbage littering the African desert. And here (forthe scene kept changing with bewildering rapidity and suddenness), herewere the five flyblown bodies he-had seen only a few months ago, facesupwards and their throats gashed, in the courtyard of an Algerian farm.Here, out of a past almost twenty years earlier, was that old woman, deadand stark naked in the rubble of a stucco house in St. John's Wood. Andhere, without transition, was his own gray and yellow bedroom, with thereflection in the mirror on the wardrobe door of two pale bodies, his andBabs's, frantically coupling to the accompaniment of his memories ofMolly's funeral and the strains, fromRadio Stuttgart, of the Good Fridaymusic out of Parsifal.The scene changed again and, festooned with tin stars and fairylamps, Aunt Mary's face smiled at him gaily and then was transformedbefore his eyes into the face of the whining, malignant stranger who hadtaken her place during those last dreadful weeks before the finaltransformation into garbage. A radiance of"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"341love and goodness, and then a blind had been drawn, a shutter closed, akey turned in the lock, and there they were—she in her cemetery and he inhis private prison sentenced to solitary confinement and, one unspecifiedfine morning, to death. The Agony in the Bargain Basement. TheCrucifixion among the Christmas-tree decorations. Outside or in, with theeyes open or with the eyes closed, there was no escape.\"No escape,\" he whispered, and the words confirmed the fact,transformed it into a hideous certitude that kept opening out, opening down,into depth below depth of malignant vulgarity, hell beyond hell of utterlypointless suffering.And this suffering (it came to himwith the force of a revelation)—thissuffering was not merely pointless; it was also cumulative, it was also self-perpetuating. Surely enough, frightfully enough, as it had come to Mollyand Aunt Mary and all the others, death would come also to him. Wouldcome to him, but never to this fear, this sickening disgust, these lacerationsof remorse and self-loathing. Immortal in its pointlessness, suffering wouldgo on forever. In all other respects one was grotesquely, despicably finite.Not in respect to suffering. This dark little inspissated clot that one called \"I\"was capable of suffering to infinity and, in spite of death, the sufferingwould go on forever. The pains of living and the pains of dying, the routineof successive agonies in the bargain basement and the final crucifixion in ablaze of tin and plastic vulgarity—reverberating, continuously amplified,they would always be there. And the pains were incommunicable, theisolation complete. The awareness that one existed was an awareness thatone was always alone. Just as much alone in Babs's musky alcove as onehad been alone with one's earache or one's broken arm, as one would bealone with one's final cancer, alone, when one thought it was all over, withthe immortality of suffering.He was aware, all of a sudden, that something was happening to themusic. The tempo had changed. Ralkntando. It was the342Islandend. The end of everything for everyone. The jaunty little death dance hadpiped the marchers on and on to the edge of the cliff. And now here it was,and they were tottering on the brink. Ral-lentando, rallentando. The dyingfall, the fall into dying. And punctually, inevitably, here were the twoanticipated chords, the consummation, the expectant dominant and then,"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"finis, the loud unequivocal tonic. There was a scratching, a sharp click, andthen silence. Through the open window he could hear the distant frogs andthe shrill monotonous rasp of insect noises. And yet in some mysteriousway the silence remained unbroken. Like flies in a block of amber, thesounds were embedded in a transparent soundlessness which they werepowerless to destroy or even modify, and to which they remainedcompletely irrelevant. Tunelessly, fromintensity to intensity, the silencedeepened. Silence in ambush, a watching, conspiratorial silenceincomparably more sinister than the grisly little rococo death march whichhad preceded it. This was the abyss to whose brink the music had pipedhim. To the brink, and now over the brink into this everlasting silence.\"Infinite suffering,\" he whispered. \"And you can't speak, you can't evencry out.\"A chair creaked, silk rustled, he felt the wind of movement against hisface, the nearness of a human presence. Behind his closed lids he wassomehow aware that Susila was kneeling there in front of him. An instantlater he felt her hands touching his face—the palms against his cheeks, thefingers on his temples.The clock in the kitchen made a little whirring noise, then started tostrike the hour. One, two, three, four. Outside in the garden a gusty breezewhispered intermittently among the leaves. A cock crowed and a momentlater, froma long way off, came an answering call, and almostsimultaneously another and another. Then an answer to the answers, andmore answers in return. A counterpoint of challenges challenged, ofdefiances defied. And now a different kind of voice joined in the chorus.343Articulate but inhuman. \"Attention,\" it called through the crowing andthe insect noises. \"Attention. Attention. Attention.\"\"Attention,\" Susila repeated; and as she spoke, he felt her fingersstarting to move over his forehead. Lightly, lightly, from the brows up to thehair, fromeither temple to the midpoint between the eyes. Up and down,back and forth, soothing away the mind's contractions, smoothing out thefurrows of bewilderment and pain. \"Attention to this.\" And she increased thepressure of her palms against his cheekbones, of her fingertips above hisears. \"To this\" she repeated. \"To now. Your face between my two hands.\"The pressure was relaxed, the fingers started to move again across hisforehead.\"Attention.\" Through a ragged counterpoint of crowing, the injunction"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"was insistently repeated. \"Attention. Attention. Atten . . .\" The inhumanvoice broke off in midword.Attention to her hands on his face? Or attention to this dreadful glare ofthe inner light, to this uprush of tin and plastic stars and, through thebarrage of vulgarity, to this packet of garbage that had once been Molly, tothe whorehouse looking glass, to all those countless corpses in the mud,the dust, the rubble. And here were the lizards again andGongylusgongyloides by the million, here were the marching columns, therapt, devoutly listening faces of Nordic angels.\"Attention,\" the mynah bird began to call again from the other side ofthe house. \"Attention.\"Will shook his head. \"Attention to what?\"\"To this.\" And she dug her nails into the skin of his forehead. \"'This.Here and now. And it isn't anything so romantic as suffering and pain. It'sjust the feel of fingernails. And even if it were much worse, it couldn'tpossibly be forever or to infinity. Nothing is forever, nothing is to infinity.Except, maybe, the Buddha Nature.\"She moved her hands, and the contact now was no longer with nailsbut with skin. The fingertips slid down over his brows344Islandand, very lightly, came to rest on his closed eyelids.For the first wincingmoment he was mortally afraid. Was she preparing to put out his eyes? Hesat there, ready at her first move to throw back his head and jump to hisfeet. But nothing happened. Little by little his fears died away; theawareness of this intimate, unexpected, potentially dangerous contactremained. Ai awareness so acute and, because the eyes were supremelyvulnerable, so absorbing that he had nothing to spare for the innei light orthe horrors and vulgarities revealed by it.\"Pay attention,\" she whispered.But it was impossible not to pay attention. However, gently anddelicately, her fingers had probed to the very quick of his consciousness.And how intensely alive, he now noticed, those fingers were! What astrange tingling warmth flowedout of them!\"It's like an electric current,\" he marveled.\"But luckily,\" she said, \"the wire carries no messages. One touchesand, in the act of touching, one's touched. Complete communication, butnothing communicated. Just an exchange of life, that's all.\" Then, after apause, \"Do you realize, Will,\" she went on, \"that in all these hours we've"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"been sitting here—all these centuries in your case, all these eternities—youhaven't looked at me once? Not once. Are you afraid of what you mightsee?\"He thought over the question and finally nodded his head. \"Maybethat's what it was,\" he said. \"Afraid of seeing something I'd have to beinvolved with, something I might have to do something about.\"\"So you stuck to Bach and landscapes and the Clear Light of theVoid.\"\"Which you wouldn't let me go on looking at,\" he complained.\"Because the Void won't do you much good unless you can see itslight in Gongylus jjongyloides. And in people,\" she added. \"Which issometimes considerably more difficult.\"\"Difficult?\" He thought of the marching columns, of the345bodies in the mirror, of all those other bodies face downwards in the mud,and shook his head. \"It's impossible.\"\"No, not impossible,\" she insisted. \"Sunyata implies karuna. The Voidis light; but it's also compassion. Greedy contempla-tives want to possessthemselves of the light without bothering about compassion. Merely goodpeople try to be compassionate and refuse to bother about the light. Asusual, it's a question of making the best of both worlds. And now,\" sheadded, \"it's time for you to open your eyes and see what a human beingreallylooks like.\"The fingertips moved up from his eyelids to his forehead, moved out tothe temples, moved down to the cheeks, to the corners of the jaw. Aninstant later he felt their touch on his own fingers, and she was holding histwo hands in hers.Will opened his eyes and, for the first time since he had taken themoksha-medicine, found himself looking her squarelyin the face.\"Dear God,\" he whispered at last.Susila laughed. \"Is it as bad as the bloodsucker?\" she asked.But this was not a joking matter. Will shook his head impatiently andwent on looking. The eye sockets were mysterious with shadow and,except for a little crescent of illumination on the cheekbone, so was all theright side of her face. The left side glowed with a living, golden radiance—preternaturally bright, but with a brightness that was neither the vulgar and"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"sinister glare of darkness visible nor yet that blissful incandescencerevealed, in the far-off dawn of his eternity, behind his closed lids and,when he had opened his eyes, in the book-jewels, the compositions of themystical Cubists, the transfigured landscape. What he was seeing now wasthe paradox of opposites indissol-ubly wedded, of light shining out ofdarkness, of darkness at the very heart of light.\"It isn't the sun,\" he said at last, \"and it isn't Chartres. Nor the infernalbargain basement, thank God. It's all of them346Islandtogether, and you're recognizably you, and I'mrecognizably me—though,needless to say, we're both completely different. You and me byRembrandt, but Rembrandt about five thousand times more so.\" He wassilent for a moment; then, nodding his head in confirmation of what he hadjust said, \"Yes, that's it,\" he went on. \"Sun into Chartres, and then stained-glass windows into bargain basement. And the bargain basement is alsothe torture chamber, the concentration camp, the charnel house withChristmas-tree decorations. And now the bargain basement goes intoreverse, picks up Chartres and a slice of the sun, and backs out into this—into you and me by Rembrandt. Does that make any sense to you?\"\"All the sense in the world,\" she assured him. But Will was too busylooking at her to be able to pay much attention to what she was saying.\"You're so incredibly beautiful,\" he said at last. \"But it wouldn't matter if youwere incredibly ugly; you'd still be a Rembrandt-but-five-thousand-times-more -so. Beautiful, beautiful,\" he repeated. \"And yet I don't want to sleepwith you. No, that isn't true. I would like to sleep with you. Very muchindeed. But it won't make any difference if I never do. I shall go on lovingyou—loving you in the way one's supposed to love people if one's aChristian. Love,\" he repeated, \"love. It's another of those dirty words. 'Inlove,' 'make love'—thoseareall right. But plain 'love'—that's anobscenity I couldn't pronounce. But now, now . . .\" He smiled and shook hishead. \"Believe it or not, now I can understand what it means when theysay, 'God is love.' What manifest nonsense. And yet it happens to be true.Meanwhile there's this extraordinary face of yours.\" He leaned forward tolook into it more closely. \"As though one were looking into a crystal ball,\" headded incredulously. \"Something new all the time. You can't imagine . . .\"But she could imagine. \"Don't forget,\" she said, \"I've been theremyself.\"\"Did you look at people's faces?\""},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"347She nodded. \"At my own in the glass. And of course at Dugald's.Goodness, that last time we took the moksha-medicine together! He startedby looking like a hero out of some impossible mythology—of Indians inIceland, of Vikings in Tibet. And then, without warning, he was MaitreyaBuddha. Obviously, self-evidently Maitreya Buddha. Such a radiance! I canstill see . . .\"She broke off, and suddenly Will found himself looking at IncarnateBereavement with seven swords in her heart. Reading the signs of pain inthe dark eyes, about the corners of the full-lipped mouth, he knew that thewound had been very nearly mortal and, with a pang in his own heart, thatit was still open, still bleeding. He pressed her hands. There was nothing, ofcourse, that one could say, no words, no consolations of philosophy—onlythis shared mystery of touch, only this communication fromskin to skin of aflowing infinity.\"One slips back so easily,\" she said at last. \"Much too easily. Andmuch too often.\" She drew a deep breath and squared her shoulders.Before his eyes the face, the whole body, underwent another change.There was strength enough, he could see, in that small frame to makehead against any suffering; a will that would be more than a match for allthe swords that fate might stab her with. Almost menacing in herdetermined serenity, a dark Circean goddess had taken the place of theMater Dolorosa. Memories of that quiet voice talking so irresistibly aboutthe swans and the cathedral, about the clouds and the smooth water, camerushing up. And as he remembered, the face before him seemed to glowwith the consciousness of triumph. Power, intrinsic power—he saw theexpression of it, he sensed its formidable presence and shrank away fromit. \"Who aw you?\" he whispered.She looked at himfor a moment without speaking; then, gaily smiling,\"Don't be so scared,\" she said. \"I'mnot the female mantis.\"348IslandHe smiled back at her-smiled back at a laughing girl with a weaknessfor kisses and the frankness to invite them.\"Thank the Lord!\" he said, and the love which had shrunk away in fearcame flowing back in a tide of happiness.\"Thank Him for what?\""},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"\"For having given you the grace of sensuality.\"She smiled again. \"So that cat's out of the bag.\"\"All that power,\" he said, \"all that admirable, terrible will! You mighthave been Lucifer. But fortunately, providentially ...\" He disengaged hisright hand and with the tip of its stretched forefinger touched her lips. \"Theblessed gift of sensuality—it's been your salvation. Half'your salvation,\" hequalified, remembering the gruesomely loveless frenzies in the pink alcove,\"one of your salvations. Because, of course, there's this other thing, thisknowing who in fact you are.\" He was silent for a moment. \"Mary withswords in her heart,\" he went on, \"and Circe, and Ninon de Lenclos andnow—who? Somebody like Juliana of Norwich or Catherine of Genoa. Areyou really all these people?\"\"Plus an idiot,\" she assured him. \"Plus a rather worried and not veryefficient mother. Plus a bit of the little prig and day-dreamer I was as achild. Plus, potentially, the old dying woman who looked out at me from themirror the last time we took the moksha-medicme together. And thenDugald looked and saw what he would be like in another forty years. Lessthan a month later,\" she added, \"he was dead.\"One slips back too easily, one slips back too often . . . Half inmysterious darkness, half mysteriously glowing with golden light, her facehad turned once again into a mask of suffering. Within their shadowy orbitsthe eyes, he could see, were closed. She had retreated into another timeand was alone, somewhere else, with the swords and her open wound.Outside, the cocks were crowing again, and a second mynah bird hadbegun to call, half a tone higher than the first, for compassion.349\"Karuna.\"\"Attention. Attention.\"\"Karuna.\"Will raised his hand once more and touched her lips.\"Do you hear what they're saying?\"It was a long time before she answered. Then, raising her hand, shetook hold of his extended finger and pressed it hard against her lower lip.\"Thank you,\" she said, and opened her eyes again.\"Why thank me? You taught me what to do.\"\"And now it's you who have to teach your teacher.\"Like a pair of rival gurus each touting his own brand of spirituality,\"Karuna, attention,\" shouted the mynah birds; then, as they drowned out"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"one another's wisdomin overlapping competition,\"Runattenshkarattunshon.\" Proclaiming that he was the never-impotentowner of all females, the invincible challenger of every spurious pretenderto maleness, a cockerel in the next garden shrilly announced his divinity.A smile broke through the mask of suffering; fromher private world ofswords and memory, Susila had returned to the present. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo,\" she said. \"How I love him! Just like TomKrishna when he goesaround asking people to feel his muscles. And those preposterous mynahbirds, so faithfully repeating the good advice they can't understand. They'rejust as adorable as my little bantam.\"\"And what about the other kind of biped?\" he asked. \"The lessadorable variety.\"For all answer she leaned forward, caught himby the forelock and,pulling his head down, kissed him on the tip of his nose. \"And now it's timeyou moved your legs,\" she said. Climbing to her feet, she held out her handto him. He took it and she pulled him up fromhis chair.\"Negative crowing and parroted antiwisdom,\" she said. \"That's whatsome of the other kind of bipeds go in for.\"350Island\"What's to guarantee that I shan't return to my vomit?\" he asked.\"You probably will,\" she cheerfully assured him. \"But you'll alsoprobably come back again to this.\"There was a spurt of movement at their feet.Will laughed. \"There goes my poor litde scrabbling incarnation of evil.\"She took his arm, and together they walked over to the open window.Announcing the near approach of dawn, a little wind fitfully rattled the palmfronds. Below them, rooted invisibly in the moist, acrid-smelling earth, wasa hibiscus bush—a wild profusion of bright glossy leaves and vermiliontrumpets, evoked fromthe double darkness of night and overarching treesby a shaft of lamplight from within the room.\"It isn't possible,\" he said incredulously. He was back again with God-the-Fourteenth-of-July.\"It isn't possible,\" she agreed. \"But like everything else in the universe,it happens to be a fact. And now that you've finally recognized myexistence, I'll give you leave to look to your heart's content.\"He stood there motionless, gazing, gazing through a timelesssuccession of mounting intensities and ever-profounder significances.Tears filled his eyes and overflowed at last onto his cheeks. He pulled out"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"his handkerchief and wiped them away.\"I can't help it,\" he apologized.He couldn't help it because there was no other way in which he couldexpress his thankfulness. Thankfulness for the privilege of being alive anda witness to this miracle, of being, indeed, more than a witness—a partnerin it, an aspect of it. Thankfulness for these gifts of luminous bliss andknowledgeless understanding. Thankfulness for being at once this unionwith the divine unity and yet this finite creature among other finitecreatures.\"Why should one cry when one's grateful?\" he said as he put hishandkerchief away. \"Goodness knows. But one does.\" A351memory bubble popped up from the sludge of past reading. \" 'Gratitude isheaven itself,' \" he quoted. \"Pure gibberish! But now I see that Blake wasjust recording a simple fact. It is heavenitself.\"\"And all the more heavenly,\" she said, \"for being heaven on earth andnot heaven in heaven.\"Startlingly, through the crowing and the croaking, through the insectnoises and the duet of the rival gurus, came the sound of distant musketry.\"What on earth is that?\" she wondered.\"Just the boys playing with fireworks,\" he answered gaily.Susila shook her head. \"We don't encourage those kinds of fireworks.We don't even possess them.\"From the highway beyond the walls of the compound a roar of heavyvehicles climbing in low gear swelled up louder and louder. Over the noise,a voice at once stentorian and squeaky bellowed incomprehensibly througha loudspeaker.In their setting of velvet shadow the leaves were like thin shavings ofjade and emerald, and fromthe heart of their gem-bright chaos fantasticallysculptured rubies flared out into five-pointed stars. Gratitude, gratitude. Hiseyes filled again withtears.Snatches of the shrill bellowing resolved themselves into recognizablewords. Against his will, he found himself listening.\"People of Pala,\" he heard; then the voice blasted into amplifiedinarticulateness. Squeak, roar, squeak, and then, \"Your Raja speaking . . .remain calm. . . welcome your friends from across the Strait ...\""},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Recognition dawned. \"It's Murugan.\"\"And he's with Dipa's soldiers.\"\"Progress,\" the uncertain excited voice was saying. \"Modern life ...\"And then, moving on from Sears, Roebuck to the Rani and Koot Hoomi,\"Truth,\" it squeaked, \"values . . . genuine spirituality ... oil.\"352Island\"Look,\" said Susila, \"look! They're turning into the com pound.\"Visible in a gap between two clumps of bamboos, the beams of aprocession of headlamps shone for a moment on the left cheek of the greatstone Buddha by the lotus pool and passed by, hinted again at the blessedpossibility of liberation and again passed by.\"The throne of my father,\" bawled the gigantically amplified squeak,\"joined to the throne of my mother's ancestors . . . Two sister nationsmarching forward, hand in hand, into the future . . . To be known henceforthas the United Kingdom of Rendang and Pala . . . The United Kingdom'sfirst prime minister, that great political and spiritual leader, Colonel Dipa ...\"The procession of headlamps disappeared behind a long range ofbuildings and the shrill bellowing died down into incoherence. Then thelights re-emerged and once again the voice became articulate.\"Reactionaries,\" it was furiously yelling. \"Traitors to the principles ofthe permanent revolution ...\"In a tone of horror, \"They're stopping at Dr. Robert's bungalow,\" Susilawhispered.The voice had said its last word, the headlamps and the roaring motorshad been turned off. In the dark expectant silence the frogs and the insectskept up their mindless soliloquies, the mynah birds reiterated their goodadvice. \"Attention, Karuna.\" Will looked down at his burning bush and sawthe Suchness of the world and his own being blazing away with the clearlight that was also (how obviously now!) compassion—the clear light that,like everyone else, he had always chosen to be blind to, the compassion towhich he had always preferred his tortures, endured or inflicted, in abargain basement, his squalid solitudes, with the living Babs or the dyingMolly in the foreground, with Joe Aldehyde in the middle distance and, inthe remoter background, the great world of impersonal forces andproliferating353"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"numbers, of collective paranoias, and organized diabolism. And always,everywhere, there would be the yelling or quietly authoritative hypnotists;and in the train of the ruling suggestion givers, always and everywhere, thetribes of buffoons and hucksters, the professional liars, the purveyors ofentertaining irrelevances. Conditioned from the cradle, unceasinglydistracted, mesmerized systematically, their uniformed victims would go onobediently marching and countermarching, go on, always and everywhere,killing and dying with the perfect docility of trained poodles. And yet in spiteof the entirely justified refusal to take yes for an answer, the fact remainedand would remain always, remain everywhere—the fact that there was thiscapacity even in a paranoiac for intelligence, even in a devil worshiper forlove; the fact that the ground of all being could be totally manifest in aflowering shrub, a human face; the fact that there was a light and that thislight was also compassion.There was the sound of a single shot; then a burst of shots fromanautomatic rifle.Susila covered her face with her hands. She was tremblinguncontrollably.He put an armround her shoulders and held her close.The work of a hundred years destroyed in a single night. And yet thefact remained—the fact of the ending of sorrow as well as the fact ofsorrow.The starters screeched; engine after engine roared into action. Theheadlamps were turned on and, after a minute of noisy maneuvering, thecars started to move slowly back along the road by which they had come.The loudspeaker brayed out the opening bars of a martial and at thesame time lascivious hymn tune, which Will recognized as the nationalanthem of Rendang. Then the Wurlitzer was switched off, and here onceagain was Murugan.\"This is your Raja speaking,\" the excited voice proclaimed. After which,da capo, there was a repetition of the speech about354IslandProgress, Values, Oil, True Spirituality. Abruptly, as before, theprocession disappeared fromsight and hearing. A minute later it was inview again, with its wobbly countertenor bellowing the praises of the newlyunited kingdom's first prime minister.The procession crawled on and now, fromthe right this time, theheadlamps of the first armored car lit up the serenely smiling face of"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"enlightenment. For an instant only, and then the beam moved on. And herewas the Tathagata for the second time, the third, the fourth, the fifth. Thelast of the cars passed by. Disregarded in the darkness, the fact ofenlightenment remained. The roaring of the engines diminished, thesqueaking rhetoric lapsed into an inarticulate murmur, and as the intrudingnoises died away, out came the frogs again, out came the uninterruptableinsects, out came the mynah birds.\"Karuna.
