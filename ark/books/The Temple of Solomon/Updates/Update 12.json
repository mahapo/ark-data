Anything left is of a general nature, academic, or to be taken with a grain of salt. It's worth noting that I've on good authority that the Aghora texts should be taken with a grain of salt; they're not entirely wrong, but there's a lot misssing or misunderstood.This has also given me an opportunity to update the aquuisition list with a few rare texts on these subjects that have eluded me:Kalikapurana, tr B.N. Shastri. Sanskrit and English in two volumes, Nag Publishers 1992. A very important work rendered here into excellent English from the Sanskrit. Apart from containing legends relating to Kamakhya, Kali, Tripura, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu et al, this very readable translation also contains information about how Shiva and Shakti decided they were so inseparable they should assumethe half male-half female form. The latter part of this purana contains pujas of the usual suspects in the Kaula tantrik school.
