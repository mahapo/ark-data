[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"I DID manage to hunt down a pile of more Scientology material. Things like mid-upper level staff courses (data evaluator series, etc.). Not sure how much some of this will be worth to folks, but least I can do is present the material. Case supervision TRs, minor sec checks in the lower bands of the bridge, how to set up the demo table, PTS, False Purpose Rundown, and various optional courses.The new level application material isn't set up in checklist format, so may be a little easier for wogs to wrap their head around. Almost 40 new files (and there is some overlap, so you can get an idea of what Scilon standardizationis reaching toward), mostly in:>Psych. Model>$cientology>$cientology basics>ApplicationAnd one more folder in (Levels 0-4, which aggregates different sets of leaked material, as well as Freezone material).Finally added the Mezlim Magazine folder as it's own section, couldn't figure out where else to place it really.Also, it's Cultus Sabbati season, and DBoE's already been in application for a week now. It's surprisingly exhausting for an autosexual method. At least the recitation for the Ka rite is easy to memorize.Greetings, /his/.The library keeps growing, little by little, this time I've got some stuff I'd forgotten about in my backlog plus a handfulof new texts I'd scrounged up from the usual resources. We're up to 31.48 GB, 357 folders, and 4428 individual files, twice the size of Grimoar, and with half the material of questionable quality often found in resources of a similar size. I'll follow up in the next post with a more narrow discussion topic, but first, the link and updates:https://mega.nz/#F!AE5yjIqB!y7Vdxdb5pbNsi2O3zyq9KQ>A.'.A.'.>CrowleyA scan of the very original edition from the early 1900's of Complete Works which focuses on poetry, etc.>A.'.A.'.>LibriNew folder, “Best of the Equinox” from the last couple years. We already have Gems, but completeness.A.'.A.'.>PhilosophyBrunham's Celesital Handbook for everyone working Practicus.>ChumbleyAndrew's “Rite of the Opposer”.>EasternChinese Herbal Formulas and Applications, and Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology>Eastern>Astrology27 Gods, 27 Stars, seems like a fairly highly regarded beginner's text on Jyotish.>Eastern>VajrayanaThe Sublime Path to Kechara Paradise."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":">EnochianAsprem's Arguing with Angels.>EuropeMystic Cults in Magna Graecia, a newish text that covers a lot of the same ground w/r/t mystery cults, it's just slightly more up to date.Agents of Witchcraft in Early Modern Italy and Denmark, what it says on the tin.Numerology and Astrology in Medieval and Early Modern Catalonia, yet another Brill edition.>LHP (Western)Dray's Infernal Path. More 2edgy modern Satanic type stuff.Hello, /his/.First, the link: https://mega.nz/#F!AE5yjIqB!y7Vdxdb5pbNsi2O3zyq9KQThis time we've got a moderate library update with some new folders and lots of new texts. The new folders are “Zoroastrianism” and “Shamanism”. Zoroastrianism has mostly new files while Shamanism is me movinng a number of books around and adding one extra. As usual expansions are alphabetized by folder.>A.'.A.'.>PhilosophyAdded “Eschatology and Space” which talks about space and it's relation to the end of being in various contexts, then added “Religion of the Gods: Ritual, Paradox, and Reflexivity”.>ChumbleyAdded four books from the bibliography: Ginzerg's “Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches Sabbath”, “Descendants ofCain”, and “Threads and Traces”. Added Wilby's “Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits”. Then added a number of ritual extracts Chumbley published here and there: Conjuration of the Witchfather, Devotional Mass for Qayin, and his article “what is traditional witchcraft?”>EasternAdded “Jainism: an Introduction”, “Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in SE Asia”, “Blackwell Companion to Hinduism”, “Dream Yoga” (looks new-agey with a dude of questionable lineage but I'm going to thumb through it anyhow), Rigveda in three volumes, “Shiva Stories & Teachings from the Mahapurana” (it's Puranic so not in my Agamic folders), and finally “Witchcraft and the Rise of the First Confucian Empire” which looks just fuckin' wonderful but I've not tore through yet.>Eastern>SaivismAdded Dupuche's exegesis on the Kaula ritual (taken, translated, and analyized from the relevant chapter of Tantraloka), a central sexual rite of that tanrik lineage.>Kabbalah“Kabbalah: A Neurocognitive Approach”, if the Zen fuckers get Neurosci attention it's high time Kabbalah does too. Haven't really gone through this one yet, but it should prove to be interesting. “Signifying the Creator: Nontextual Sources in Ancient Judaism”, and “The Name of God in Jewish Thought”."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":">Psychological ModelAdded Jung's notes from a lecture “On the Psychology of Kundalini Yoga”.>ShamanicNow contains “In Darkness and Secrecy”, “Sex Worship and Symbolism”, “Shamanism: A Biopsychosocial Paradigm” and the newly added “Jaguar Within” which touches on shapeshifting in Meso/South American artforms.Moved most of my academic request folder into here as that's what people were requesting.>ZoroastrianismAdded “Zoroastrian Ritual in Context” which is awesome as it validates a bit of my speculation last thread that the Zoroastrians may have employed initiatic principles in their rites. “Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism” takes extracts from scripture. It's a stepping stone for more. The new folders are small, but my Euro folder started small too.Hello, /his/.First, the link: https://mega.nz/#F!AE5yjIqB!y7Vdxdb5pbNsi2O3zyq9KQAnother 20 texts, this time centered mostly around Gnosticism, but we've got a few others. I moved all of my Yezidimaterial, questionable or not, into it's own folder. We're almost up to 4500 texts (4481).>BeginnersDictionary of Gnosticism and Esotericism. It's a great starter or generalist reference. Thumbed through it and was impressed enough with the comprehensiveness and neutrality that I figure I should toss it in the beginner's folder.>GnosticismCoptic Gnostic Chrestomathy, which is instruction through literature. Gnosis: Study and Commentary on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy. Gnostic Religion in Antiquity, which appears to be a pretty basic intro, more basic than Rudolph's text. Gnosticism and Late Platonism: Themes, Figures, and Texts. Another Seed: Studies in Gnostic Mythology. Astrological Medicine in Gnosticism, Mystery of the Five Seals, Gnostic Initiation Reconsidered, which argues for initiatic mystery traditions inside of the Gnostic emanations. Studies in Gnostic Mythology. The Alphabet in Mandean and Jewish Gnosticism, which has some great contemplative methods and a few prayers intended to tie the body and mental processes to the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, it draws greatly from Sefer Yetizirah, and could probably be integrated into modern praxis with little or no trouble. And, finally, the Present State of Gnostic Studies, an article that gives an overview of where we are and how far we've come in academic study.>KabbalahJewish Gnosticism by Scholem. It's in the Kabbalah folder as I imagine GS goes into more Kabbalistic avenues than not, though I can swich folders if I thumb through it and he doesn't do his usual bit of referencing REALLY obscure bits of Kabbalistic thought. >Psychological Model>JungAdded “The Gnostic Jung and the Seven Sermons of the Dead”, an analysis of said sermons and their relation to Gnostic thought.>Samuel Aun WeorAdded his text Revolution of the Dialectic, which delves into the Greek Sacred Psychiatry as reckoned by the academic material in my Euro folder. Both concepts are rooted in Plato: Plat. Rep. 7.533, c&d, and the comment"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"on dialectic's ability to raise the soul through the slime of Orphic myth.>YezidiYezidism: Its Background, Observances, and Texts. Intro to thought and a goodly chunk of hymns in the second portion of the book. Given the concepts that Cultus Sabbati borrows, I'd be willing to hedge a bet that this is one of the primary sources for their bits of Yezidi thought. That said, most of these ideas could also be ascribed to Kaula, like crystaline time flows and possession by entities, and it might be worthwhile in academia/comparative religion tomake a study of Yezidi/Tantra relations as have been done with Kabbalah/Tantra.>ZoroastrianismAvesta Eschatology, or how these cats viewed the End of Days. Avesta, Pahlavi, and Ancient Persian Studies. Chattamanavaka Gatha, a very short text. Contradictions and Vile Utterances: Zoroastrian Critique of Judaism. This thing is fuckin' hilarious. Between Gnosticism and the rise of Kabbalah, a Zoroastrian writes a fuckhuge shitpost about how Judaism (and Christianity and Islam) have screwed the pooch. This is an analysis and extracts of that text. Zoroastrian Diaspora Religion, and The Daeva Cult in the Gathas."}]
