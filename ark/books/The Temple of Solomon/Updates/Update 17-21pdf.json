[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"UPDATE 17This time I've added two new folders in A.'.A.'.>Aleister CrowleyThe first is a small file where I've moved my diary fragments and added a .zip with a fuckton of sometimes unpublished diaries.The next one is a bit more important. In A.'.A.'.>Aleister Crowley you'll now find a folder called the Yorke Microfilms of the Warburg Collection. It contains Films 1, 6, and 8. This includes A.'.A.'. folderswith unpublished material, hundreds of unpublished pages of commentary on AL, and typescripts/handwritten drafts and notes of some of Crowley's books. I have Film 4, but it's somewhat illegible, and I'm still in negotiations Interlibrary Loan to obtain two or three more films. An index is included in the folders to help navigate, as I've arranged it using The Yorke Microfilm's own categorization system. Other than people working in a university, when it comes to serious occultniks, probably less than 20 people have access to this. That number is about to get much larger. I'd recommend that any passer by with a TO.bz account download this material and post it over there.UPDATE 18>A.'.A.'.>Crowley>Yorke Microfilms of the Warburg CollectionAdded Yorke Microfilm #9Added the preview of Liber AL vel Bogus in that folder for insight as to why OS 23 is missing.>A.'.A.'.>LibriAdded \"Thelema\", or the original 1909 copies of the Holy Books; these would have been given to you if you'd met Crowley and joined A.'.A.'. as soon as it was public. Notice the differences between those books and what we have today.>A.'.A.'.>Libri>PestilenceAdded a number from ITC with the comment on Liber VII that's in Equinox vol. 4 no. 1 as well as the issue of MZLA which has a different comment. Imo, the comments can only be understood when read together.>A.'.A.'.>ThelemaAdded a GBG folder, with the CF Russell material.>KabbalahGeniza Fragments, or the earliest extant writing we have on the Hekhalot and Merkava mysticism, it was already more or less fully developed.UPDATE 19New Folder ->Psychological ModelIntro to PsychopharacologyFreud-Einstein LettersThe Ego by Anna FreudThe Secret of the Golden Flower (Jung-Reich)"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":">Psychological Model>JungModern Man in Search of a SoulMythos and Logos in Carl Jung: The Theory of Collective Unconscious in Scientific PerspectivePsychology and ReligionPsychology and the OccultThe Red Book (Fixed, double confirmed, will be replacing the one in A.'.A.'.>Philosophy)(Could really use his UFO book)>Psychological Model>MilitaryIG SERE RecommendationJWP366SERE ManualSERE's Gitmo 'SOP' memoPsychological Skills Training and SERE StressUS Army Aviation Survival Part I: Survival Elements, Psychological Aspects, and Survival Medicine>Psychological Model>ReichCharacter AnalysisFunction of OrgasmFury on EarthSexual Theories of Wilhelm ReichEfficiency of PsychotherapyThe BionsAmerican OdysseyListen, Little ManThe Mass Psychology of FascismPsychological Model>ScientologyAdmissionGoing Clear; Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of BeliefHubbard's FBI fileThe Bridge (hq image)Psychological Model>Scientology>$cientology Basics>ApplicationARC StraightwireEarly TR DrillsGrade Levels 0-4NEDsScientology Class 0-4 AuditorClear ExpansionExpanded Dianetics LecturesPsychological Model>Scientology>$cientology Basics>StudyAdvanced Procedure and AxiomsClear Body, Clear MindDianetics 55!Dianetics The Evolution of a ScienceDianetics the Modern Science of Mental HealthDianetics the Original Thesis"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Handbook for PreclearsMisc WritingsRevolt in the StarsScience of SurvivalScientology 0-8Scientology 8-80Scientology 8-8008 (Great for AP)Scientology A History of ManA New Slant on LifeFundamentals of ThoughtSelf AnalysisTechnical DictionaryVol. 2 HandbookPsychological Model>Scientology >Technical BulletinsThe Technical Bulletins of Dianetics and Scientology, vols I-XII + XIV, XVI and Power & Solo.Psychological Model>Scientology>Upper Track WorkNew Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans (aka NOTs)OT Level Gradwork I-VIII (Tech Bull XIV)Scientology Case Supervisor Class VIII AuditorFreezone OT VIISt. Hill Briefing CourseUPDATE 20>A fuckton of Gnostic/Manichean material from Brill>Clavicula Nox: Maleficarium Nigra>Tuba Veneris allegedly by John Dee>Religion and the Emergence of Civilization>Serpent Songs by FrisvoldSome fiction ->The Scarlet GospelsAnd, last but most certainly not least ->The Dragon Book of Essex, a Cultus Sabbati manual of initiation into the Crooked PathUPDATE 21A.'.A.'.>PhilosophyJohn Zorn's Arcana V.

It's an academic version. May throw it in the Grimoires folder.Initiation into the Mysteries of the Ancient World. Another academic, presents pretty decent reconstructions of the Eleusinian cult, and others. May throw this in the A.'.A.'.>Philosophy file.Greek Sacred Law. This thing is almost required for reconstructing the Greek religion. Combine this with Greek Magical Papyrus and the newly included reconstruction of the Greek mystery cults and, like, das it mane. Magic and Ritual in the Ancient World. More straight anthropology than anything else, though there may be something useful for folks out there. Sperg alert: It's mostly only in here because of the Greek/Roman bits, which are only in a chapter or two.Witchcraft and Belief in Early Scotland. Haven't looked. Probably useful for certain types of Wiccan, Pagan, or Cultus Sabbati folks.>GnosticismThe Mithras Liturgy.

Haven't looked at it, but it's PROBABLY a refutation of difference between Pseudo-Dio and the idiot that Paul converted.>Voodoo/AfricanObeah Witchcraft in the West Indies. Very old. It's a decent snapshot of what Afro-Carib magic looked like as soon as it coalesced, but it's old anthropology so take it with a few grains of salt."}]
