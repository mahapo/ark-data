Figured I'd post some of the books I've collected in the last few weeks. For those that missed it, Sex and Religion has been added, finally, and can be found in the A.'.A.'. > Libri folder. This thread will be the new home of my library updates. When I need to update,I'll post the next catalog of what's been added.

It's a Scandanavian blending of Solomonic and folk magic, much in the vein of Galdrabok. Beyond that, I'mstill on the look-out for Teitian Press editions, any that may be floating around, but they might be another that I'll have to obtain and scan to post.Enjoy!Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,Frater Katabaino"}]
