You'll notice Equinox vol. 3 nos 1-10 does NOT include No. 9, which is Holy Books of Thelema. It will not appear, as all of these texts are covered in the Class A folder. The same applies to Equinox 4:1, which will not appear, with Comments on the Holy Books being covered under the Pestilence folder.This brings us even closer to completion. I need “Chinese Mysticism”, or Equinox 5:3, and a small amount of Teitian Press books accomplish having created the most thorough repository of modern magickal reference.Love is the law, love under will.Fraternally,Frater Kynokephalos."}]
