[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Sun in 23° Virgo, Moon in 6° AquariusAnno IVxxi Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.Care, Aspirants.This update is small in texts, but large in scope. I've revised the Various folder to cut out the fluffy bullshit and many duplicates. I ended up dropping about 200 files, bringing us down to a lean 2500. There was a lot in the Various folder that needed moved. I've added some folders:>Wicca>Reformed DruidsThe Wicca folder only contains BTW pertinent files. Moreover, some folders got expansions:>LHP>LaVey>Grimoires>Solomon>Grimoires>PicatrixBeyond that, the changes are too numerous to detail: I moved my Yezidi material to LHP, I added somestragglers to the A.'.A.'. philosophy file, and moved a lot into Yoga, as well as European (including exegesis on Galdrabok). Most significant, though, is that I've finished the Grimoires folder (not really, but if you need anything else you can visit our friends at The Twilight Grotto). This leave the Various folder only really containing: Boring but workable occultism that isn't outright trash, encyclopedias, other paranormal but not expressly occult practices, and shit I didn't feel like making a folder for. There's still a few gems in there, so don't think it's worthless.Anyway, here are the actual texts added:>GrimoiresAdded a Picatrix folder with versions in Latin, a few different edition of the English translation. 6 filesfor all of your concordance needs. Picatrix deserves a lot of attention, hence it's own folderAradia; The Gospel of WitchesArtabelForbidden Rites (solid academia)Grand Grimoire + Dark Lodge editionGrimoire of TurielAbramelin; A New Translationand finally:Shams-al-Ma'arifThe interesting thing about Shams al-Ma'arif is that it's in Spanish...and also hard to find. Best I could do, so if any of you bilingual practitioners can extract anything of use, go for it. I'm going to see if I can manage to translate the manuscript like I did for the Frater Thor material, but I can't make any promises.I'm writing this to reinforce that we're officially larger than grimoar.cz. We have a large variety of material that they do not. This project has been expanding and filling holes, adding things I've only"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"looked at in hardcopy, or files that have just been not on the internet until the last couple of years. There's only so much room I have for growth in this library (not in space, but in terms of published material that I consider relevant and/or GOOD).So where to next? We don't have much from Tetian Press. There are three other high profile texts that I'd like to get on here. One is already in my possession, it simply needs to get scanned. The other two are Equinox 5:3 by Thelema Publishing (Motta's outfit) and Equinox 3:10, the Caliphate publications shortly after Breeze was elected OHO. Both targets are more for annotations and supplementary material (comments, reviews, poems) than any hard to find content (the vast majority of 3:10 is alreadyavailable in this library).I'll still be on the lookout for interesting material, and requests, but this is getting to be about as complete as it gets in terms of occult material. Enjoy!Love is the law, love under will.~1366"}]
