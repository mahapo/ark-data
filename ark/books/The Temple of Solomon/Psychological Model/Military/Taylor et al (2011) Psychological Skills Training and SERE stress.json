Adams, MSC USN*ABSTRACT In this randomized, controlled field study, we examined the effects of a brief psychological skills train-ing (PST) intervention on stress responses during military survival school. A second purpose was to build upon priorresearch in this unique environment by extending the follow-up window to 3 months. Baseline subjective distress (dis-sociative) symptoms were measured in 63 male military subjects, who were then randomized either to PST or a controlgroup that received no training beyond the normal survival school curriculum. PST received training in arousal con-trol, mental imagery, goal setting, and positive self-talk in two separate 40-minute sessions before stressful field exer-cises. Stress symptoms were then assessed during a mock-captivity phase of training, as well as 24 hours, 1 month, and3 months after completion of training. Repeated-measures analyses of variance with follow-up paired t tests examineddifferences between groups and across time. Survival training precipitated remarkable increases in subjective distress,but few substantive group differences emerged. This study extends prior work quantifying the human stress response tointense military training.INTRODUCTIONCombat stress and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) arecritical military health concerns'\"'. In a landmark report.Huge et al' revealed prevalence rates of Army and MarineCorps infantry personnel meeting screening criteria for majordepression, generalized anxiety, or PTSD at 15.5 to 17.1%after duty in Iraq and 9.3% after duty in Afghanistan. Thesescientists^ subsequently reported similar prevalence rates inlarge samples of Army soldiers and Marines completing aroutine postdeployment health assessment. More recently,postdeployment prevalence rates for PTSD and depression forNational Guard soldiers have been estimated as high as 31%depending on level of functional impairment.' Other key stud-ies suggest that postdeployment prevalence rates for mentaldisorders are moderated by pre-existing mental health status.^All told, medical and disability care for veterans of the GlobalWar on Terror has been conservatively estimated to exceed''Department 163 (Behavioral Sciences & Epidemiology), Naval HealthResearch Center, 140 Sylvester Road, San Diego, CA 92106.tDepartment 162 (Warfighter Performance), Naval Health ResearchCenter, 140 Sylvester Road, San Diego, CA 92106.ICenter for Security Eorces—Detachment North Island, John McCainBoulevard, Building 618, San Diego, CA 92135.The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not nec-e.ssarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Navy,Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government.

This staggering statistic has prompted aug-mentation of current post-trauma treatment modalities with\"proactive\" approaches such as early intervention''' and pre-exposure stress inoculation.*Promising examples of early intervention are found inpost-combat debriefing as well as pharmacological treat-ment. Adler et al,''^ for instance, studied a cognitive andskills-based stress intervention termed Battlemind aimed atpromoting réintégration following combat. In a randomizedtrial, they showed that individuals with high levels of com-bat exposure who received Battlemind reported fewer post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression symptoms, and sleepproblems at 4 months follow-up compared to individuals ina standard stress education intervention.' Another leadingstrategy is termed Psychological First Aid\" which is designedto help trauma survivors and first responders regain a senseof safety, reduce physiological arousal, and increase self-confidence and control. In pharmacological research, use ofthe N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist ketamine aspart of a perioperative anesthetic regimen in injured OperationIraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom service mem-bers has been linked to fewer PTSD symptoms,'' and mor-phine treatment after combat injury in Iraq has been shown toreduce risk of PTSD development.'\" Other pharmacologicalstudies have examined beta-adrenergic blockers (e.g., propa-nolol)\" and anxiolytics (e.g., benzodiazepines)'-; but the find-ings remain inconclusive.Less is known regarding the efficacy of interventionsdesigned to inoculate against operational stress reactionsbefore exposure. Selye\" theorized that physiological systemscan \"learn\" adaptive defensives against future stress expo-sure and that conditioning factors are capable of promot-ing adaptation. Following this basic tenet, stress exposure is1362MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 176, December 201 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Effect of Psychological Skills Traininga foundational element of virtually all military basic train-ing programs—primarily via methods to simulate the com-bat environment as realistically as possible. In addition tobuilding wartighter resilience, this approach typically pro-duces attrition, thus yielding a more homogenous group ofñt warfighters via the so-called \"healthy warrior effect.\"^Other efforts to promote inoculation include immersive sim-ulation,'^\" graphic instructional manuals,\"' and cognitive-behavioral stress inoculation training.\"Stress inoculation training is a generic term describingcognitive-behavioral techniques employed as \"conditioningfactors\" to promote or expedite adaptation. Saunders et al\"*performed a meta-analysis examining the overall effective-ness of stress inoculation training and concluded that it is aneffective means for reducing performance anxiety and enhanc-ing performance under stress. Specifically, it is shown to beeffective for both high- and normal-anxious populations, andits beneficial effects appear to increase with increased num-ber of training sessions. Although there is growing interestin stress inoculation training in military settings, few con-trolled studies have systematically quantified its outcomeswith respect to operational stress reactions or the evolution ofPTSD. In one exception, Littman et al'\"* examined the effectsof a 7-month, 13-session stress inoculation training programon Army officers participating in a professional course. Slightincreases were observed in dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate(an anabolic precursor believed to confer neuroprotection)during daily living compared to a control group. In other set-tings, stress inoculation training programs have additionallybeen linked to outcomes such as reduced oxygen consump-tion, decreased respiration, slower heart rate, lower bloodpressure, and decreased sympathetic nervous system modula-tion.-\" Administered appropriately, stress inoculation trainingmay hold distinct advantages over other approaches becauseit is cost-effective, it emphasizes proactive coping and self-engagement, and it circumvents the stigma commonly linkedto medical treatment.An evidence-based stress inoculation package found inthe competitive sport literature'' and gaining popularity inmilitary contexts---' is termed psychological skills training(PST). PST typically includes a selected combination of goalsetting, arousal/attentional control, positive self-talk, andmental imagery (i.e., inducing a symbolic sensory experi-ence in any sensory mode).-^ Goal setting as a motivationalapproach to enhancing task performance is one of the mostthoroughly researched areas in management and organiza-tional environments.-*^ This literature suggests that specificgoals lead to higher performance than general goals or \"doyour best\" goals. It also suggests that challenging goals leadto higher levels of performance than easy goals and that set-ting short-term plus long-term goals enhances performanceover long-term goals alone. Arousal control is implementedbecause although most performers in extreme environmentsexperience anxiety, the ability to control it and/or use it toone's advantage has been shown to distinguish elite fromnonelite performers.-*\" Additionally, attentional control mayinsulate performers from catastrophic performance degra-dation (i.e., choking under pressure).-' Also, research hasdemonstrated the efficacy of positive thought content andself-statements on human performance.-'^'*-'' Barwood et al-demonstrated the effectiveness of positive .self-talk as a com-ponent of a multidimensional PST program on breath holdperformance during cold-water immersion. Regarding men-tal imagery. Murphy^\" reported findings from a survey ofOlympic athletes showing that 90% of them used mentalimagery for training and competition, and 94% of Olympiccoaches used it with their athletes. Similarly, elite athletes arereportedly more proficient at mental imagery than their non-elite counterparts.\"There is a salient need to establish the efficacy of PST andrelated approaches on critical health endpoints in realistic mili-tary environments—ideally in randomized, controlled designs.The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of briefPST on operational stress responses during realistic militarysurvival training. A secondary purpose was to build upon priorstudies quantifying the hutnan stress response in this ecologi-cally valid context,'-\" specifically by extending the follow-upwindow to 3 months. It was hypothesized that survival train-ing would precipitate substantial stress responses, which inturn would be modulated by PST. It was also expected that thepsychological impact of survival training would diminish orresolve within 3 months.METHODSMilitary Survival TrainingSurvival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) training isdescribed in earlier reports'** and some portions of the cur-riculum are classified. Briefly, U.S. military members whoare deemed \"high risk of capture\" are required to attend thiscourse which includes a period of mock-captivity. After aninitial phase of classroom-based instruction, students are takento a field training site where they are taught SERE techniques.Training tasks include evasion from a simulated enemy and,upon eventual \"capture,\" students must practice resistance tovarious forms of simulated exploitation in stressful mock-captivity-related training challenges. The entire course (includ-ing academics plus field instruction) lasts approximately 12 days.Because SERE training is designed in part to simulate a captiv-ity experience, it is a unique platform to prospectively evaluatethe effects of highly realistic stress on human functioning. Agrowing literature verifies that SERE is intensely stressful asevidenced by considerable alterations of stress hormones,\"\"manifestation of peritraumatic dissociative symptoms,\"'\" andsignificant degradation of cognitive function.\"*'''SubjectsSubjects included 65 healthy, male active duty Navy person-nel (mean ± SE age 25.0 ± 0.5 years).

Those who expressed an interest in partic-ipating attended an in-person meeting to review the detailsof the study and provide written informed consent. This pro-tocol was approved by the Naval Health Research CenterInstitutional Review Board.Overview of ProtocolSubjects completed a baseline self-report measure of disso-ciative symptoms on the first day of the academic phase ofSERE training. They were then randomized to either the PSTor control group. The groups did not differ significantly withrespect to age, education, body mass index, years of mil-itary service, or baseline subjective distress (p > 0.05). Onthe fifth day of training, subjects completed academic train-ing and transitioned to a field training site. Over the next7 days, subjects entered the field for didactic training. Duringthis time, the PST group received additional training (describedin detail below). Subsequently, all subjects experienced a rig-orous evasion exercise followed by a highly realistic mock-captivity scenario. Dissociative symptoms were then assesseddirectly after a stressful mock-captivity event. Approximately24 hours after the release from mock-captivity (which markedthe end of training), all subjects completed the measure of dis-sociative symptoms again, as well as a measure of psychologi-cal impact of a mock-captivity event. Finally, psychologicalimpact was measured in identical format by mailed survey at1 -month and 3-months follow-up.Psychological Skills TrainingThe psychological skills selected for this intervention wereba.sed on their demonstrated efficacy with respect to stressmitigation and performance enhancement in competi-tive sport-' and military-relevant contexts\"\" The interven-tion (developed and administered by a clinical psychologydoctoral student under the guidance of one scientist withdoctoral-level sport psychology expertise and two clinicalpsychologists with human performance expertise) followedgeneral instructional guidelines espoused by Weinberg andGould.^'' The following topics were covered in two 40-minutesessions: goal setting,-' arousal control,-' positive self-talk,^\"and mental imagery.-'' The PST intervention was adminis-tered during the field didactic phase of training before theevasion phase. Each psychological skill, which is a commonelement of stress inoculation progiams, is briefly describedbelow.Arousal ControlSubjects were taught a deep-breathing technique to mod-ify their arousal level. Specifically, subjects were instructedto recall a stressful experience from a prior training evolu-tion and then practice a slow 4-count breath in, followed by4-count breath out. for 4 minutes. They were educated aboutthis technique, given opportunities to practice it with assis-tance, and encouraged to identify ways that it could be usedduring the anticipated Stressors of survival training.Mental ImagerySubjects were taught the fundamentals of mental imagery (i.e.,inducing a symbolic sensory experience). Emphasized skillsincluded controllability (learning to control images) and mul-tisensory imaging (incorporating as many senses as possibleto promote realism). They were educated about the technique,given opportunities to practice it with assistance, and encour-aged to envision ways it could be used during the anticipatedchallenges of survival training.Goal SettingSubjects were educated about effective goal-setting strategies,were given an opportunity to practice the skill with assistance,and engaged in guided goal-setting for the anticipated chal-lenges of SERE training.Positive Self-TalkA simple cognitive restructuring technique was used wherebysubjects were taught to recognize self-defeating and/or irratio-nal internal dialogue and to replace it with more constructive,rational dialogue. They were provided with examples of thistechnique and were encouraged to use the technique to man-age the anticipated Stressors of survival training.AssessmentsClinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS)The 19 sell-report items from the CADSS'\" were used toassess the frequency and intensity of state symptoms of disso-ciation. Although the CADSS includes additional items usedfor clinical observation of the participant, the sell-report itemshave been shown to comprise a valid, reliable, and indepen-dent indicator of dissociative state symptoms.'-''' This scale,designed to assess how perceptually connected or discon-nected an individual is relative to the individual's environ-ment, was administered immediately after a high-intensity,mock-captivity challenge. It is composed of 19 items, ratedon a Likert scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), with a pos-sible total score of 76. Examples of items include, \"Did youspace out or in some way lose track of what is going on'?\" and\"Did you feel as if you are looking at things from outside yourbody?\" Subjects were asked to respond to the questions rela-tive to the stressful mock-captivity event. Cronbach's alpha inthe present sample was 0.58,0.91, and 0.88 at baseline, mock-captivity, and 24-hour recovery, respectively.Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IESR)\"The IESR is a self-report measure designed to assess cur-rent subjective distress for any specific life event. It has22 items, comprising 3 subscales corresponding to DSM-IV-specified PTSD symptoms: avoidance (IES-Avoid; mean of8 items measuring the extent to which the respondent avoidssituations that remind him or her of the stressful or traumaticevent), intrusion (IES-Intrusion; mean of 8 items assessingthe extent to which one experiences intrusive thoughts), and1364MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 176. December 201 :"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Effect of Psychological Skills Traininghyperarousal (IES-Arousal; mean of 6 items measuring anger,irritability, heightened startle response, and hypervigilance).In this study, respondents completed the IESR 24 hours afterthe conclusion of survival training. The directions were mod-ified to ask the participant how distressing each difficultyhas been with respect to the high-intensity mock-captivityevent on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). IESR wasadministered again by mail in identical format at 1 month and3 months after SERE training. Adequate teliability and pre-dictive validity have been shown for this scale.^' Cronbach'salpha reliabilities in this study were 0.92 at 24 hours, 0.91 at1 month, and 0.93 at 3 months.Assessment of PST EffectivenessThis questionnaire served as a \"manipulation check\" explor-ing the effectiveness of the PST intervention. After the conclu-sion of SERE training, subjects from both groups were askedto report the extent to which they utilized arousal control, men-tal imagery, goal setting, and positive self-talk throughout theSERE course, on a scale of 1 (did not use) to 7 (u.sed very much).Subjects were also asked if they have used these psychologicalskills before and whether they have been taught these skills ina structured environtiient (in yes-no format). In addition, theywere asked to report the extent to which they felt confidentand in-control during the stressful mock-captivity event on ascale of 1 (not confident/no control) to 7 (extremely confident/complete control). Finally, subjects in the PST group werequestioned whether they found the PST intervention helpfuland whether it increased their confidence (in yes-no format).Data AnalysisData were analyzed using SPSS software Version 16 (SPSSInc., Chicago, IL). Characteristics of the distributions for alldependent variables were examined to determine if assump-tions of normality were met.\"*\"* Slight to moderate positiveskew was detected for the dependent variables (dissociativesymptoms and psychological impact) for which logarithmicand squate root transformations were performed, respectively.Descriptive analyses were conducted and t tests explored theeffectiveness of the PST intervention. Repeated-measuresanalyses of variance (ANOVA) with follow-up (Bonferroni-corrected) paired / tests were then used to examine differencesacross time and group for dissociative symptoms and psy-chological impact, respectively. Hypothesis tests were basedupon transformed dependent variables; untransformed meansare reported for ease of interpretation. Hypothesis tests weretwo-sided, and the probability of committing a type I errorwas set at 0.05.RESULTSSubject characteristics are displayed in Table I.

As shown, subjects in both groupsreported using psychological skills during SERE somewhatfrequently (4.3 to 5.2 of a possible 7), and no significant dif-ferences prevailed relative to psychological skills use, con-fidence, or control during SERE. However, the majority ofsubjects in the PST group reported that the intervention washelpful (90.3%) and increased their confidence during SERE(83.3%). Very few subjects in either group reported previoususe of or formal instruction in PST. No adverse effects of theintervention were reported or observed.Fifty-two percent of subjects endorsed any dissociativesymptoms during the baseline assessment, whereas 94.4%endorsed any dissociative symptoms during mock-captivity.The 2 (group) x 3 (time) ANOVA on dissociative symptomsrevealed a significant time effect (F = 95.9, p < 0.001, partialr\\- - 0.64) (Figure 1 ). Bonferroni-corrected follow-up / testsshowed that dissociative symptoms during mock-captivityexceeded that of both baseline (p < 0.017) and 24-hour recov-ery (p < 0.017). Baseline and recovery did not differ from eachother {p > 0.017). As evidenced in Figure I, no interaction orgroup effects (i.e., PST vs. control) were derived.Subjects reported \"a little bit\" of psychological impact 24hours after release from mock-captivity (M ± SE IESR score0.9 ± 0.1 of a possible 5.0).

Percentages of sub-jects endorsing no psychological impact were 1.5% at 24 hours,6.5% at 1 month, and 46.4% at 3 months.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we examined the effects of PST on stressresponses during military survival school—an ecologicallyvalid context known to confer substantial psychologicalstress. A second purpose was to augment prior studies quan-tifying the stress response in this environment by expandingthe follow-up interval to 3 months. Survivai training precipi-tated remarkable increases in subjective stress symptoms, butno effects of the PST intervention were observed.Irrespective of group assignment, a remarkable stressresponse to SERE training was detected (i.e., main effect).CADSS scores were substantially elevated from prestressto mock-captivity and then returned to near baseline values24 hours after the completion of training. This essentially rep-licates our prior study in a separate, demographically simi-lar cohort''' and corroborates a growing literature elucidatingbehavioral,\" physiological,\"-\" and neurocognitive pertur-bances\"\"*-\"* of survival stress exposure. It is noted, however,that mean CADSS dissociation scores during mock-captivity{M = 14.5) were somewhat lower than that observed in theprior study (M - 25.6) as well as that previously observed ingeneral soldiers undergoing Army SERE training (M = 22.5 ).\"This may reflect subtle changes in the SERE curriculum result-ing in inconsistent application of stress or subtle differencesin demographic characteristics from previous subject pools. Itmay also be a spurious finding.Psychological impact at 24-hours recovery was nearlyidentical to that ob.served in our earlier work.'\"* Also, this is(to our knowledge) the Hrst available account of sustainedor delayed psychological impact of military survival trainingacross a substantial time frame (3 tnonths). As expected, onlya subset of the original sample was utilized because of nonre-sponse—thus placing a crucial limitation on interpretation ofthese data. Nonetheless, the available data suggest that psy-chological impact diminishes in a predictable fashion acrossthis time frame. Future research is needed to more compre-hensively examine longer-term health outcomes and the recov-ery trajectory after SERE with adequate sample sizes. This isparticularly important in light of the fact that many SERE stu-dents return to high-risk operational platforms or training envi-ronments (e.g., aviation. Special Warfare) within 72 hours ofcompletion.Contrary to expectation, PST did not have discernableeffects on subjective distress during SERE or in follow-up.As discussed earlier, the psychological skills selected for thisintervention were based on their demonstrated efficacy withrespect to stress mitigation and performance enhancement inelite sport and military-relevant contexts, but it is not knownif PST may significantly influence reactions to—or recovery1366MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 176. Decetnber 201 !"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ejfect of Psychological Skills Trainingfrom—intense military stress. There are several plausibleexplanations for the observed null result. First, the data sug-gest that there were negligible manipulation effects. That is,although most PST subjects reported that it was helpful andincreased their confidence, quantitative comparisons to thecontrol group on confidence, control, and frequency of psy-chological skills use during SERE revealed no significantdifferences. Unexpectedly, both groups reported using psy-chological skills during SERE training somewhat frequently.This resonates with evidence in the sport p.sychology literaturesuggesting that many athletes possess inherent psychologicalskills or develop them in the absence of formal instruction.'\"Since most SERE students are highly functioning, well-trainedmilitary members competitively selected for their occupations,a comparable phenomenon may be operating here. This mayimply that PST interventions are more effective when admin-istered during rudimentary phases of military training (i.e.,basic training) and/or in more \"mainstream\" military popula-tions. An equally important factor is that, because of logisti-cal constraints, the PST intervention was brief—administeredin two 4()-minutes sessions. Although the stress inoculationliterature suggests that positive effects can be gleaned from asingle session, they logically increase with number of trainingsessions.'*Logistical constraints also confined the PST interventionto a field location during the didactic pha.se of SERE. Duringthis phase, students are beginning to experience operationalstres.sors (i.e., hunger, fatigue, and sleep deprivation) andas a result, may not be cognitively prepared to receive, pro-cess, integrate, and ultimately benefit from a psychologicalskills curriculum. Stress, of course, is a common banier tolearning and skill acquisition when it exceeds an individual-specific \"optimal level.\"'\"' It is generally accepted that PST ismost beneficial when it is administered across the long term(the offseason is typically recommended for competitive ath-letes), initially conducted in a low-stress environment, andperformed in distinct phases (i.e., education, acquisition, andpractice).-^ Clearly, the PST intervention in this study wasnot performed under gold-standard circumstances; rather, itwas integrated within an existing military training curriculumon a nc)t-to-interfere basis. Moreover, this study included amodest sample size, and future work will benefit from largercohorts.In this study, we examined the effects of PST on stressresponses during military survival school. Secondary purposeswere to confirm the stress response to this unique context andto observe the recovery trajectory across 3 tnonths. Survivaltraining led to remarkable increases in subjective stress symp-toms, but few observable effects of the PST interventionwere obtained—possibly because of negligible manipulationeffects, subjective endpoints, and brevity of the intervention.Future research is needed to comprehensively evaluate theutility of PST on operational stress reactions—preferably inrandomized, controlled designs involving phased interven-tions with large study samples.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSAppreciation is extended to students and staff at Center for Security Forces—Detachment North Island for \"training the best for the worst.'\" We alsoappreciate Dr. Daniel R.
