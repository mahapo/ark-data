(U) Background (U) The August 2006 oro review id ntified three major gaps in the senior-level detention and interrogation operatio reports released to date. One of the areas of concern was the migration oftrainin techniques into the operational environment without proper oversight. The repo acknowledged the extremely important role that the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (1 RA) and the Level C Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Schools perform in preparing U,S. high-risk-of-capture personnel for isolation from friendly forces. How ver, it was widely recognized that the SERE training techniques used in the captivity train ng environment were not appropriate for interrogation operations. (U) To ensure that the recommended corrective action was implemented across the Department, we reviewed the issue om the perspective of the oversight offices for the defense intelligence and SERE com unities. The USD (I) is responsible for approving all policies, orders, directives, and d ctrine related to intelligence interrogation operations. The Deputy Assistant Se retary of Defense Prisoner of War /Missing Personnel Affairs [DASD (pOW )] has primary responsibility for developing DoD policy pertaining to personnel recov ry and SERE training. United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), as Executiv Agent for Personnel Recovery, is responsible for the oversight of SERE programs, les policy. The JPRA is the Office of Primary Responsibility. In that capacity, JP oversees, evaluates, and assesses accredited DoD SERE training programs. (U) Related to the use of SERE tee iques used for interrogation purposes, the OIG \"Review of DoD-Directed Investigat ons of Detainee Abuse,\" August 25,2006, recommended the following: (U) that the Under Secretary fDefense for Intelligence (USD(I) develop policies that preclude the use f SERE physical and psychological coercion techniques and other external interrogation techniques that have not been formally approved for use in offensive interrogation operations (recommendation C.l) (U) that the Commander, US FCOM, Office of Primary Responsibility for Personnel Recovery and Exe utive Agent for all SERE training, implement formal policies and procedur s that preclude the introduction and use of physical 1 t , ) !

(U) Corrective Action 1a en (U) Under Secretary of Defense for Ii telligence. On September 6, 2006, shortly after our August 25 report, the Army revis doctrinal interrogation guidance, with Army Field Manual 2-22.3, \"Human Intellig nce Collector Operations.\" The manual does not authorize the use of any SERE techni ues as approved intelligence interrogation techniques. (0) In October 2006, USD(I) stated t t it was fully supportive ofUSJFCOM policy prohibiting JPRA personnel from part cipating in any aspect of intelligence interrogation operations and that it had requested th t USJFCOM restate this prohibition in its interrogation policy as well. The US (I) also confirmed their intention to amend DoD Directive 3115.09, \"DoD Intelligence nterrogations, Detainee Briefings, and Tactical Questioning,\" with the same prohibiti n. (U) The revised DoD Directive 3115. 9 was issued on October 9,2008, and included the following requirement: Survival Evasion Resistance and Esca e Techni ues. Use of SERE techniques against a person in the custody or effective control of the Department of Defense or detained in a DoD facility i prohibited. (U) U.S. Joint Forces Command. T e Commander, USJFCOM, issued a Personnel Recovery Memorandum to highlight p licy guidance prohibiting the use of SERE techniques for interrogations and to re pond to the OIG report, \"Review of DoD-Directed Investigations of Detainee Abuse\" (Se Appendix A). The June 17, 2009, Memorandum for the Services and the U.S. Special perations Command specifically states that the \"SERE techniques for interrogations 0 personnel in DoD custody or control is prohibited. \" (U) Scope and Methodol gy (U) We conducted this field verificati n from June 19,2009 through September 18, 2009 in accordance with Council of the Ins ctors General on Integrity and Efficiency Quality Standards for Inspections. Those stan ards require that we plan and perform the inspection to obtain sufficient approp ate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our inspection objectives. We limited our scope to DoD Level C SERE training and cond cted on-site inspections of six schools and the Personnel Recovery Academy. We be ieve that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and c nclusions based on the objective. 2 y I ! I r I I I ! i i I ! i !

DoD I Training Recomme plemented SERE dation (U) The DoD Level C SERE Schools implemented the original DoD 10 Report recommendation to preclude the use fphysical and psychological coercion techniques outside the training environment. • Commander, U.S. Joint Force Command issued Personnel Recovery Guidance Memorandum, \"Prohibition 0 the use of Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) or Code ofC nducHelated Techniques for Interrogation Purposes,\" June 17, 2009. • Based on our observations at e DoD Level C SERE Schools, we concluded that all accredited DoD SERE trai ing included the provision in their student briefings and academic curriculum. • SERE school military leaders ip took immediate proactive steps to formalize the requirement. • The Joint Personnel Recover Agency 17, as the Training action office, executed its oversight responsibilities t oughout the implementation process. • Making the prohibition part 0 the permanent oversight guidance can reinforce the aforementioned actions. (U) However, to formalize the prohib tion, the guidance should be included in the DoD Instruction 1300.21, \"Code of Condu t Training and Education\" and JPRA \"Executive Agent Instructions for Wartime and eacetime Level C Training in Support of the Code of Conduct (CoC).\" (U) Background (U) The Training Environment. Per onnel recovery is defined as the sum total of military, diplomatic, and civil efforts equired to prepare for and execute the recovery and reintegration of isolated personnel. e CoC outlines the basic responsibilities and obligations that govern the actions of every member of the Armed Forces during peacetime or wartime. It includes ba ic information useful to isolated personnel in their efforts to survive honorably while res sting their captor's exploitation strategies. CoC Level C training is the most challengi g and, in order to enhance student learning, requires highly trained SERE instruct rs who use physical and psychological pressures. As stated in DoD Instruction 1300.21 \"Code of Conduct (CoC) Training and Education,\" January 8, 2001, the Secretaries ofth Military Departments are required to develop and establish a Level C training program or personnel whose jobs entail a significant or high risk of being isolated behind enemy r es as an evader or a captive and who are vulnerable to greater-than-average ex loitation by a captor. Level C SERE training includes a simulated prisoner of war I aptivity situation designed to create a series of dilemmas in a dynamic, yet cantrolle , training environment. 3"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(U) CoC and SERE training are a fo of combat training that uses \"controlled realism\" to confront students with actual deten ion and interrogation experiences that require them to apply survival and resistance prine pies, procedures, and techniques. Specifically, resistance to interrogation training in ludes all the tools and techniques used to defend against a captor's exploitation plan. (U/r'fOUO~ Resistance training expo es each student to the captivity environment and interrogation approaches that they m encounter in a hostile situation. In order to enhance training, SERE instructors u e techniques that are designed to realistically project students' focus into the traini g scenario. The intent is to simulate harsh conditions associated with the captivi envirorunent and associated captor exploitation efforts. The application of physical p essure enhances the correct psychological projection students require and better repares them to respond favorably to stressful events. By introducing effective copi g skills before 'real life' exposure, stress inoculation training prepares individu Is to respond more favorably to high stress events. \"Controlled realism\" pressures allow reasonable means to train for the most challenging captivity environment where captors 0 not abide by the Geneva Convention. (U) The physical and psychological p essures developed for CoC and SERE training were not intended for real-world inte ogations. Intelligence resistance training does not qualify a SERE Specialist instructor t conduct interrogations or provide subject matter expertise to those who are trained in t at specialty. At the conclusion of training, SERE students must undergo a debriefmg/se inar session to clarify their resistance training experience; even then they are only e posed to the details that apply to the learning process.

Furthermore, DoD policy and Service regulatory guidance prohibit operati n of Resistance Training Labs (training facility) and practical resistance and escape hands on training or exercises without approval of JPRA. (U) DoD Instruction 1300.21, \"Code of Conduct Training and Education,\" January 8, 2001, provides guidance to develop d execute CoC training for U.S. personneL The JPRA employs the Executive A ent Instructions as the guidance document used to certify and evaluate CaC related trai ing throughout the DoD. The two JPRA Executive Agent Instructions, \"Requirements:6 r Wartime Level C Training in Support of the Code of Conduct\" and \"Requirements for eacetime Level C Training in Support of the Code of Conduct\" establish the minimum ERE training outcomes for high-risk-of-capture personnel. The Level C training pro ams must enable graduates to achieve the terminal learning objectives. The specific en ling learning objectives and content requirements are designed to ensure uniformity, co sistency, and adequacy of training as defined in governing directives. However, the RA has not yet revised these instructions to include the prohibition. Not only is e revision needed to institutionalize the prohibition, but also to ensure continued compli ce throughout the oversight and evaluation process. (U) Conclusion (U) Our field verification found that he DoD Level C SERE Schools and the Personnel Recovery Academy implemented the DoD IG Report Recommendation and the Personnel Recovery Guidance Memorandum,\" rohibition on the use of Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) or C de of Conduct-related Techniques for Interrogation Purposes,\" June 17,2009. All stude ts and instructors who are exposed to SERE training techniques are made aware of their 0 ligation to restrict their use outside of the training environment.

(U) The JPRA, as the Office of Prim y Responsibility for the DoD Executive Agent for Personnel Recovery, is best suited to complete implementation of the prohibition on the use of SERE or Code of Conduct-reI ted techniques for interrogation purposes.
