into a social revolution or a nationalistic movement; a social revolution may transform into militant nationalism or a religious movement; and nationalist movement may transform into a social revolution or a religious movement) It is rare for a mass movement too be wholly of one character; it usually displays some facets of other types of movement, and sometimes it is two or three

barrenness, and meaninglessness of an individual existence Where new creeds vie with one another for the allegiance of the populace, the one which comes with the most perfected collective framework wins The fiercest fanatics are often selfish people who were forced, by innate shortcomings or external circumstances, to lose faith in their own selves; they separate the instrument of their

together; a group that is particularly contemptuous of death is usually close-knit and thoroughly unified To ripen a person for self-sacrifice he must be stripped of his individual identity, most drastically by complete assimilation of the individual in the collective body The individual fully assimilated into the collective never feels alone; to be cast out from the group is the equivalent of being cut off from life The collectivized individual is in a primitive state of being, equivalent to that in primitive tribes – mass movements strive to approximate this primitive perfection"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS The capacity to resist coercion, torture, or annihilation stems partly from the individual‟s identification with a group; individualists crush easily Dying and killing seem easy when they are part of a ritual, ceremonial, dramatic performance, or game; there is a need for some kind of make-believe to face death unflinchingly One of the main tasks of the leader of a mass movement is to mask the grim reality of dying and killing by evoking in his followers the illusion that they are participating in a grandiose spectacle, a solemn or light-hearted dramatic spectacle Glory is largely a theatrical concept which requires a vivid awareness of an audience (and a definition of terrorism is the act of violence, or the threat of violence, against non-combatants to influence an audience) In the practice of mass movements, make-believe plays perhaps a more enduring role than any other factor; when faith and the power to persuade are gone, make-believe lingers on"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS Once the mass movement starts rolling, the present is shoved off the

lose much The mass movement decries pleasures and comforts and extols the rigorous life, fashioning individual existence as dour, hard, repressive, and dull; ordinary enjoyment is deemed trivial or discreditable, and the pursuit of individual happiness is immoral The very impracticality of many of the goals which a mass movement sets itself is part of the campaign against the present – all that

act; so all mass movements strive to interpose a fact-proof screen between the faithful and the realities of the world by claiming that absolute truth is already embodied in their doctrine and there is neither truth nor certitude outside it"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS It is the certitude of his infallible doctrine that renders the true believer impervious to the uncertainties, surprises, and unpleasant realities of the world around him In order to be effective a doctrine must not be understood, but rather has to be believed – we can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand The devout are always urged to seek the absolute truth with their hearts and not their minds; when a movement begins to rationalize its doctrine and make it intelligible, it is a sign that its dynamic span is over and that it is interested primarily in stability"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS If a doctrine is not unintelligible it has to be vague; and if neither unintelligible nor vague, it has to be unverifiable – one has to get to heaven or the distant future to determine the truth of an effective doctrine There is an illiterate air about the most literate true believer, using words as if he were ignorant of their true meaning; hence his taste for quibbling, hair-splitting, and scholastic tortuousness The true believer is without wonder and hesitation; the true doctrine is the master key to all the world‟s problems"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS The fanatic is not a stickler to principle – he embraces a cause not primarily because it is just or holy but because he has a desperate need to hold onto something The fanatic can swing suddenly and wildly from one cause to another Fanatics of all kinds are similar to one another, at one end of the pole despite seemingly at opposite ends of religious, social, or ideological poles The radical and reactionary have more in common than either has with the liberal or conservative Hatred is the most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying agents Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a God, but never without belief in a devil Common hatred unites the most heterogeneous elements, even erstwhile enemies"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS The genius of a great leader consists in concentrating all hatred on a single foe, making even adversaries far removed from one another seem to belong to a single category The ideal devil is a foreigner; to qualify as a devil, a domestic enemy must be given a foreign ancestry A sublime religion inevitably generates a strong feeling of guilt (given the disparity between the lofty doctrine and the imperfect practice), and the feeling of guilt promotes hate and brazenness The more sublime the faith, the more virulent the hatred it breeds The influence of the fanatic is out of all proportion to his abilities; by converting and antagonizing he shapes the world to his own image (such as causing democracies to become zealous, intolerant, and ruthless) Hatred is a convenient instrument for mobilizing a community for defense, but we often pay for it by losing all or many of the values we have set out to defend"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS Part of the attractiveness of the mass movement to its adherents is the emergence of a new freedom from the loss of individual judgment: the freedom to hate, bully, lie, torture, murder, and betray without shame or remorse Hatred is not only a means of unification but also its product Imitation is an essential unifying agent The one-mindedness prized by every mass movement is achieved as much by imitation as obedience There is a connection between frustration and the readiness to imitate – the frustrated imitate to search for a new identity or camouflage their individual distinctness, to be like others The ready imitativeness of a unified following is both an advantage and a peril to a mass movement: while the faithful are easily led and molded, they are also particularly susceptible to outside influences – a unified group is easily seduced and corrupted"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS The preaching of all mass movements warns against copying foreign models – the imitation of outsiders is branded as treason and apostasy Contempt for the outside world is the most effective defense against disruptive imitation – every device is used to cut of the faithful from interaction with unbelievers We tend to exaggerate the effectiveness of persuasion as a means of inculcating opinion and shaping behavior – we falsely attribute to propaganda the startling successes of mass movements Propaganda on its own cannot force its way into unwilling minds; neither can it inculcate something new; nor can it keep people persuaded once they have ceased to believe Propaganda penetrates only into minds already open, articulating and justifying opinions already present in the minds of its hearers Where opinion is not coerced, people can be made to believe only in what they already “know”"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS Propaganda by itself succeeds mainly with the frustrated Even skillful propaganda cannot keep people persuaded once they have ceased to believe – force must then be used for the mass movement to maintain itself Propaganda becomes more fervent and importunate when it operates in conjunction with coercion than when it has to rely solely on its own effectiveness Propaganda serves more to justify ourselves than to convince others; the proselytizing terrorist must reinforce the conviction that his faith is the only true one or he will feel himself to be a criminal The more blood the terrorist sheds, the more he needs to believe in his principles as absolutes – only the absolute will absolve him in his own eyes The practice of terror serves the true believer not only to cow and crush his opponents, but also to invigorate and intensify his own faith"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS Where a mass movement can either persuade or coerce, it usually chooses the latter Force can stop and crush even the most vigorous mass movement, but to do so the force must be ruthless and persistent Ruthless and persistent force can only come from fanatical conviction – the violence needed to counter a mass movement must spring from a spiritual base to avoid being wavering and uncertain (fanaticism is needed to counter fanaticism) The proselytizing fanatic strengthens his own faith by converting others – the creed whose legitimacy is most easily challenged is likely to develop the strongest proselytizing impulse The leader cannot create the conditions which make the rise of a mass movement possible – he cannot conjure a movement out of the void There has to an intense dissatisfaction and an eagerness to follow before the movement and the leader can make their appearance"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS Once the stage is set, the presence of an outstanding leader is indispensable – without the leader there will be no movement It needs the iron will, daring, and vision of an exceptional leader to concert and mobilize existing attitudes and impulses into the collective drive of a mass movement and kindle the vision of a breathtaking future The quality of ideas seems to play a minor role in mass movement leadership – what counts is the arrogant gesture, the complete disregard of the opinions of others, the single-handed defiance of the world Charlatanism of some degree is indispensable to effective mass movement leadership; there can be no mass movement without some deliberate misrepresentation of facts The true believer, no matter how lawless and violent his acts, is basically an obedient and submissive person"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND TRUE BELIEVERS The literati and intellectuals often set the stage for the fanatics There is a moment (before he formulates a philosophy and a program) when the articulate finder of fault may be won over by a deferential or conciliatory gesture from those in power A mass movement is pioneered by articulate intellectuals, materialized by fanatics, and consolidated by leaders of action (usually different people, men or women, play these roles in succession, as conditions require) The leader of action saves the movement from the suicidal dissensions and recklessness of the fanatics, marking the end of the dynamic phase of the movement The leader of action fixes and perpetuates the mass movement‟s unity and readiness for self-sacrifice, relying mainly on drill and coercion but preserving as a façade the earlier enthusiasm of faith At the end of its vigorous span, the mass movement is an instrument of power for the successful and an opiate for the frustrated"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND THE TIPPING POINT “The Tipping Point,” Malcolm Gladwell (2002): how ideas, products, messages, and behavior spread like viruses – the moment when everything changes all at once Contagious behavior (e.g., viral marketing) Small number of people in small number of situations start behaving differently and that behavior spreads and changes the behavior of others in similar situations Examples: trends in: fashion, crime or anti-crime, music, fads, religion, ideology Small changes can have big effects A few percent change in initial conditions can lead to non-linear outcomes (like a single match with limited energy can start a forest fire) Changes can occur quickly, not gradually (e.g., epidemics or punctuated equilibrium in evolution) "},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND THE TIPPING POINT People are conditioned for linearity and gradualness, not exponential or geometric progression But social change can be as sudden as the phase change of rain to snow The 95/5 rule (a more extreme version of the 80/20 rule): 5% of people cause 95% of new ideas to spread Stickiness in messages (sticks in memory and has impact) Simple changes in presentation or structuring of information can make a big difference in impact Examples: “Winston Tastes Good Like a Cigarette Should” (1954) “It Takes a Licking and Keeps

context"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND THE TIPPING POINT The Law of the Few Starting an information epidemic requires concentrating resources on a few key areas Success of social epidemic heavily depends on involvement of three types of people: “Connectors”: gregarious and know many people, active in many different social and professional niches and subcultures “Mavens”: experts, socially motivated to share information “Salesman”: persuaders, articulate and inherently good at convincing others after rapidly obtaining their trust and support Mavens generate the message, Connectors spread it, and Salesmen persuade the unconvinced to heed the message"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND THE TIPPING POINT Stickiness: message should be made practical and personal Information should be packaged in a simple way to make it irresistible Context Behavior is a function of social context Little things matter When interpreting the behavior of others, people overestimate the importance of fundamental character traits and underestimate the importance of situation and context Humans are more attuned to personal cues than contextual cues (a simpler, but inaccurate, description of reality) Groups have a critical role in social epidemics "},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND THE TIPPING POINT To bring about a fundamental change in people‟s belief and behavior, a change that would persist and serve as an example to others, a community must be created around the beliefs For groups to serve as incubators of messages (or ideas) they should be kept below 150 members (the maximum size for informal, person-to-person contact and cohesive group loyalty (e.g., an Infantry Company) Larger groups spontaneously become divided and alienated To create one contiguous movement (e.g., an “epidemic”), first create many small movements "},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"MEMETICS AND THE TIPPING POINT Rumor: most contagious of all social messages Kernel of truth in rumor (or urban legend) is distorted in 3 directions: (1) Level story (i.e., leave out details essential for understanding true meaning of incident) (2) Sharpen story (i.e., make remaining details more specific) (3) Assimilate story (i.e., change story so it makes sense to those spreading the rumor) Example: rumors of 9/11 Mavens, Connectors, and Salesmen make an idea contagious by dropping extraneous details and exaggerating other details so that message acquires a deeper meaning and is better understood by the intended recipients
