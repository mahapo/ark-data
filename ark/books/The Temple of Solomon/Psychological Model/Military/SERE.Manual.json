It serves as a guideline to be followed by all members of thearmed forces, particularly when in a captured or detained status. It is professional and inspirational ratherthan a penal code. Failure to live up to the full extent of its obligations is not a criminal offense. Adequateauthority exists under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for that malfeasance’s which can be properlytermed criminal acts. Should a service member engage in actions punishable under the UCMJ, they maybe prosecuted under that statute, but not under the Code of Conduct. It is recognized that inhumantreatment and the application of psychological techniques have succeeded in individual cases in forcinginvoluntary departures from the standards set forth by the Code and can be expected to do so in thefuture. Notwithstanding these past and possible future departures, it would be unwise to officiallyadvocate voluntary departures for any reason. The individual must be expected to adhere to both thespirit and the intent of the Code of Conduct to the full extent of their physical, mental, and moralresources. The wisdom of the Code of Conduct has been confirmed by former captives who found it asource of strength in situations of severe duress.ARTICLE II am an American, fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I amprepared to give my life in their defense. Article I of the Code of Conduct apply to all service members at all times. A member of the armedforces has a duty to support the interests and oppose the enemies of the United States regardless of thecircumstances, whether in active participation in combat or captivity.Past experience of captured Americans reveal that honorable survival of captivity requires that a memberpossess a high degree of dedication and motivation. Maintaining these qualities requires knowledge ofand a strong belief in its institutions and concepts. Possessing the dedication and motivation fostered bysuch beliefs and trust will enable prisoners to survive long, stressful periods of captivity and return tocountry and family honorably and with their self-esteem intact.ARTICLE III will never surrender of my on free will. If in command I will never surrender the members of mycommand while they still have the means to resist. Members of the Armed Forces may never voluntarily surrender. Even when isolated and no longer ableto inflict casualities on the enemy or otherwise defend themselves, it is their duty to evade capture andrejoin the nearest friendly force. When cut off, shot down or otherwise isolated in enemy controlledterritory, they must make every effort to avoid capture. The courses of action available includeconcealment until recovered by friendly rescue forces, evasive travel to a friendly or neutral territory, andevasive travel to other pre-briefed areas."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"4 The responsibility and authority of a commander never exceeds to the surrender of command, even ifisolated, cut off or surrounded, while the unit still has the power to resist, break out, or evade to joinfriendly forces. Only when evasion by members is impossible and further fighting would lead only to theirdeath with no significant loss to the enemy, might the means to resist or evade be considered exhausted. Capture does not constitute a dishonorable act if all reasonable means of avoiding it have beenexhausted and the only alternative is certain death.ARTICLE IIIIf I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escapeand aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. The duty of a member of the Armed Forces to continue resistance to enemy exploitation by all meansavailable is not lessened by the misfortune of capture. Contrary to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, enemieswhich U.S. forces have engaged since 1949 have regarded the PW compound as an extension of thebattlefield. The Prisoner of War (PW) must be prepared for this fact. In disregarding provisions of the Geneva Conventions, the enemy has used a variety of tactics to exploitPW’s for propaganda purposes or to obtain military information. Resistance to captor exploitation effortsis required by the Code of Conduct. Physical and mental harassment, general mistreatment and torture,medical neglect and political indoctrination have all been used against PW’s in the past. Under the guidance and supervision of the senior military person and PW organization, PWs must beprepared to take advantage of escape opportunities whenever they arise. In communal detention, thewelfare of the PWs who will remain behind must be considered. A PW must “think escape,” must try toescape if able to do so and must assist others to escape. The enemy has tried to tempt PWs to acceptspecial favors or privileges not given to other PWs in return for statements or information desired by theenemy or for a pledge by the PW not to try to escape. A PW must not seek special privileges or acceptspecial favors at the expense of his fellow PWs. Parole agreements and promises given the captor by aprisoner of war to fulfill stated conditions, such as not to bear arms or not to escape, in consideration ofspecial privileges, such as release from captivity or lessened restraint. The United States does notauthorize any service member to sign or enter into any such parole agreementARTICLE IVIf I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no informationor take or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am senior, I willtake command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back themup in every way. Officers and non-commissioned officers will continue to carry out their responsibilities and to exercisetheir authority in captivity. Informing or any other action detrimental to a fellow PW, is despicable and isexpressly forbidden. Prisoners of war must especially avoid helping the enemy to identify fellow PWswho may have knowledge of value to the enemy and who may therefore, be made to suffer coerciveinterrogation. Wherever located, PWs, for their own benefit, should organize in a military manner under the seniorperson eligible for command. The senior person (whether officer or enlisted) within the PW camp or with"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"5a group of PWs, shall assume command accordingly to rank without regard to military service. Thisresponsibility and accountability may not be evaded. When taking command, the senior person will inform the other PWs and will designate the chain ofcommand. If the senior person is incapacitated or is otherwise unable to act for any reason, the nextsenior person will assume command. Every effort will be made to inform all PWs in the camp (or group)of the members of the chain of command who will represent them in dealing with enemy authorities. Theresponsibility of subordinates to obey the lawful orders of ranking American military personnel remainsunchanged in captivity. The senior military person is required to represent the prisoners under his controlin matters of camp administration, health, welfare and grievances. However, it must be borne constantlyin mind that the enemy has often viewed PWs as valuable sources of military information and ofpropaganda that can be used to further the enemy’s war effort.ARTICLE VWhen questioned, should I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, servicenumber and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability. Iwill make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful to theircause. When questioned, a prisoner of war is required by the Geneva Conventions, this Code and is permittedby the UCMJ to give name, rank, service number and date of birth. Under the Geneva Conventions, theenemy has no right to try to force a PW to provide any additional information. However, it is unrealisticto expect a PW to remain confined for years reciting only name, rank, service number and date of birth.There are many PW camp situations in which certain types of conversation with the enemy are permitted.For example, a PW is allowed, but not required by this Code, the UCMJ or the Geneva Conventions, tofill out a Geneva Conventions capture card, to write letters home and to communicate with captors onmatters of health and welfare. Accordingly, each prisoner must exercise great caution when filling out a capture card, when conductingauthorized communication with the captor and when writing letters. A PW must resist, avoid or evade,even when physically and mentally coerced, all enemy efforts to secure statements or actions that willfurther the enemy’s cause. A PW should recognize that any confession signed or any statement made may be used by the enemy aspart of a false accusation that the captive is a war criminal rather than a PW. Moreover, certain countrieshave made reservations to the Geneva Conventions, in which they assert that a war criminal convictionhas the effect of depriving the convicted individual of prisoner of war status, thus removing them fromprotection under the Geneva Conventions. They thus revoke the right to repatriation until a prisonsentence is served. Such statements or actions constitute giving the enemy unauthorized information. Examples ofstatements or actions PWs should resist include oral or written confessions, questionnaires, personalhistory statements, propaganda recordings and broadcast appeals to other prisoners of war to complywith improper demands, appeals for surrender or parole, self-criticisms, oral or written statements,communication on behalf of the enemy or harmful to the United States, it’s allies, the Armed Forces orother PW’s."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6 Experience has shown that even when coerced beyond name, rank, service number, date of birth andclaims of inabilities, it is possible to thwart an interrogator’s efforts to obtain useful information by theuse of certain additional ruses and stratagems, provided there is a will to resist. If a PW finds that, under intense coercion, unauthorized information was unwillingly or accidentallydisclosed, then the member should attempt to recover and resist with a fresh line of mental defense.ARTICLE VII will never forget that I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions anddedicated to the principles which make my country free. I will trust in my God and in the UnitedStates of America. A member of the Armed Forces remains responsible for personal actions at all times. This Article isdesigned to assist members of the Armed Forces to fulfill their responsibilities and to survive captivitywith honor. The Code of Conduct does not conflict with the UCMJ and the latter continues to apply toeach military service member during captivity (or in other hostile detention). A member of the ArmedForces who is captured has a continuing obligation to resist all attempts to indoctrination and to remainloyal to country, service and unit. Every member of the Armed Forces of the United States shouldunderstand that members can be held legally accountable for personal actions while detained. Upon repatriation, PW’s can expect their actions to be subject to review, both as to circumstances ofcapture and as to conduct during detention. The purpose of each interview is to recognize misconduct.The reviews will be conducted with due regard for the rights of the individual and consideration for theconditions of captivity. Every member of the Armed Forces of the United States should understand the importance of ensuringthat their personal affairs and family matters (pay, powers of attorney, will, car payments and children’sschooling) are kept current through discussion, counseling or filing of documents prior to being exposedto risk of capture. That failure to accomplish these has resulted in an almost overwhelming sense of guilton the part of the PWs, and has placed unnecessary hardship on family members.The national policy expressed by the President of the United States in promulgating the Code ofConduct:“No American prisoner of war will be forgotten by the United States. Every available means willbe employed by our government to establish contact with, to support and to obtain the release ofall our prisoners of war. Furthermore, the laws of the United States provide for the support andcare of dependents of the Armed Forces including those who become prisoners of war. I assuredependents of such prisoners that these laws will continue to provide their welfare.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"7 CHAPTER IIGENEVA CONVENTIONSRELATIVE TO THE TREATMENTOF PRISONERS OF WAR1949EXTRACT OF PERTINENT ARTICLESNOTE: The complete Article is quoted, unless otherwise stated.LEGAL STATUSARTICLE 1. The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the presentConvention in all circumstances.STUDENT NOTE: Your knowledge of these Articles is what makes the Geneva Conventionswork.

Prisoners of war are in the hands of the enemy Power, but not of the individuals ormilitary units who have captured them. Irrespective of the individual responsibilities that may exist,the Detaining Power is responsible for the treatment given them. Prisoners of war may only be transferredby the Detaining Power to a Power which is a party to the Convention and after the Detaining Power hassatisfied itself of the willingness and ability of such transferee Power to apply the Convention. Whenprisoners of war are transferred under such circumstances, responsibility for the application of theConvention rests on the Power accepting them while they are in its custody. Nevertheless, if that Powerfails to carry out the provisions of the Convention in any important respect, the Power by whom theprisoners of war were transferred shall, upon being notified by the Protecting Power, take effectivemeasures to correct the situation or shall request the return of the prisoners of war.

Theprisoner’s representative shall be eligible for reelection. (NOTE: this conflicts with the Article IV ofCode of Conduct, which states the senior soldier will take charge)In camps for officers and persons of equivalent status or in mixed camps, the senior officer among theprisoners of war shall be recognized as the camp prisoner representative. In camps for officers one shall"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"15assist him or more advisors chosen by the officers; in mixed camps, his assistants shall be chosen fromamong those prisoners of war who are not officers. Every representative must be approved by thedetaining power before he has the right to commence his duties. Where the detaining power refuses toapprove a prisoner of war elected by his fellow prisoners of war, it must inform the protecting power ofthe reason for refusal. In all cases the prisoner representative must have the same nationality, andlanguage and customs as the prisoners of war for which he represents. Thus prisoners of war distributedin different sections of the camp according to their nationality language and customs shall have for theirsection their own prisoner representative, in accordance with the fore going paragraphs.ARTICLE 81. Prisoners' representatives shall not be required to perform any other work, if theaccomplishment of their duties is thereby made more difficult. Prisoners' representatives may appointfrom amongst the prisoners such assistants as they may require. All material facilities shall be grantedthem, particularly a certain freedom of movement necessary for the accomplishment of their duties(inspection of labor detachments, receipt of supplies, etc.) Prisoner representatives shall be permitted tovisit premises where prisoners of war are detained, and every prisoner of war shall have the right toconsult freely his prisoners' representative. All facilities shall likewise be accorded to the prisoners'representatives for communication by post and telegraph with the detaining authorities, the ProtectingPowers, the International Committee of the Red Cross and their delegates, the Mixed MedicalCommissions and representatives of labor detachments shall enjoy the same facilities for communicationwith the prisoners' representatives of the principal camp. Such communications shall not be restricted, norconsidered as forming a part of the quota mentioned in Article 71. Prisoners' representatives who aretransferred shall be allowed a reasonable time to acquaint their successors with current affairs. In case ofdismissal, the reasons therefore shall be communicated to the Protecting Power.LAWS OF DETAINING POWERARTICLE 82. A prisoner of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations and orders in force in thearmed forces of the Detaining Power; the Detaining Power shall be justified in taking judicial ordisciplinary measures in respect of any offense committed by a prisoner of war against such laws,regulations or orders. However, no proceedings or punishments contrary to the provisions of thisChapter shall be allowed. If any law, regulation or order of the Detaining Power shall declare actscommitted by a prisoner of war to be punishable, whereas the same acts would not be punishable ifcommitted by a member of the forces of the Detaining Power, such acts shall entail disciplinarypunishment only.ARTICLE 85. Prisoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committedprior to capture shall retain, EVEN IF CONVICTED, the benefits of the present Convention.NOTE: Certain nations have important reservations of this article. These countries insist any prisonerof war convicted of an ALLEGED war crime under the laws of the restraining power loses the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"16protection afforded of the G C. This means ANY admission by a PW is subject to interpretation by acapturing power. If it suits the purpose, the country making the reservation can interpret the normalcombat duties of a soldier as war crimes. Even if the charged PW is given a trial, the results and sentenceare predetermined, asTHE ONLY EVIDENCE CONSIDERED IS THE PRISONER'S ADMISSION.DISCIPLINARY SANCTIONSARTICLE 89. The disciplinary punishments applicable to prisoners of war are the following:(1) A fine which shall not exceed 50 percent of the advances of pay and working pay which theprisoner of war would otherwise receive under the provisions of Article 60 and 62 during aperiod of not more than 30 days.(2) Discontinuance of privileges granted over and above treatment provided for by the presentConvention.(3) Fatigue duties not exceeding two hours daily.(4) Confinement The punishment referred to under (3) shall not be applied to officers.In no case shall disciplinary punishments be inhuman, brutal or dangerous to the health ofprisoners of war.ARTICLE 90. The duration of any single (disciplinary) punishment shall in no case exceed 30 days.Any period of confinement awaiting the hearing of a disciplinary offense or the award ofdisciplinary punishment shall be deducted from an award pronounced against a prisoner of war.The maximum of 30 days provided above may not be exceeded, even if the prisoner of war isanswerable for several acts at the same time when he is awarded punishment, whether such acts arerelated or not. The period between the pronouncing of an award of disciplinary punishment and itsexecution shall not exceed one month. When a prisoner of war is awarded a further disciplinarypunishment, a period of at least three days shall elapse-between the execution of any two of thepunishments, if the duration of one of these are ten days or more.ESCAPEARTICLE 91. The escape of a prisoner of war shall be deemed to have succeeded when: (1) He has joined the armed forces of the Power on which he depends or those of an ally of the saidPower. (2) He has left the territory under the control of the Detaining Power on which he depends or thoseof an ally of said Power. (3)He has joined a ship flying the flag of the Power on which he depends or of an allied Power, in theterritorial waters of the Detaining Power, the said ship not being under the control of the last namedPower.

A prisoner of war who attempts to escape and is recaptured before having made goodhis escape in the sense of Article 91 shall be liable only to a disciplinary punishment in respect of this act,even if it is a repeated offense. A prisoner of war who is recaptured shall be handed over without delay tothe competent military authority. Article 88, fourth paragraph, notwithstanding, prisoners of warpunished as a result of an unsuccessful escape shall be subjected to special surveillance. Such surveillanceshall not affect the state of their health, must be undergone in a prisoner of war camp and must not entailthe suppression of any of the safeguards granted them by the present Convention.NOTE: Offenses committed by PWs with the sole intention of facilitating their escape and which do notentail any violence against life or limb, such as offenses against public property, theft without intention ofself-enrichment, the drawing up of false papers or the wearing of civilian clothing shall occasiondisciplinary punishment only. The use of weapons against PWs, especially those attempting to escape,shall constitute an extreme by warnings. Killing during an escape can be punished by death.If an escape is successful and the successful escapee is later recaptured, he may be subject to judicialaction for those offenses entailing violence to life or limb or not otherwise within Article 93, GPW.It should be noted that a soldier successfully effecting an escape is again a combatant (his legal status)and subject to the law of war. Killing of civilians or other breaches of the Conventions, to effect hisescape subject him to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. (Articles 42, 91, 93 GPW)ARTICLE 93. Escape or attempt to escape, even if it is a repeated offense, shall not be deemed anaggravating circumstance if the prisoner of war is subjected to trial by judicial proceedings in respect ofan offense committed during his escape or attempt to escape. In conformity with the principle stated inArticle 83, offenses committed by prisoners of war with the sole intention of facilitating their escape andwhich do not entail any violence against life or limb, such as offenses against public property, theftwithout intention of self-enrichment, the drawing up of false papers or the wearing of civilian clothing,shall occasion disciplinary punishment only.ARTICLE 97. Prisoners of war shall not in any case be transferred to penitentiary establishments(prisons, penitentiaries, convict prisons, etc.) to undergo disciplinary punishment therein. All premises inwhich disciplinary punishments are undergone shall conform to the sanitary requirements set forth inArticle 25. A prisoner of war undergoing punishment shall be enabled to keep himself in a state ofcleanliness, in conformity with Article 29. Officers and persons of equivalent status shall not be lodged inthe same quarters as non- commissioned officers or men. Women prisoners of war undergoingdisciplinary punishment shall be confined in separate quarters from male prisoners of war and shall beunder the immediate supervision of women.ARTICLE 126.

Plant Foods (Before using the following guide use your evasion chart to identify edible plants):Note: If you cannot positively identify an edible plant and must use an unknown plant, these guidelinesmay help you determine edibility.(1) Selection Criteria:(a) Before testing for edibility, ensure there are enough plants to make testing worth your time and effort. Each part of a plant (roots, leaves, stems, bark, etc.) requires more than 24 hours to test. Do not waste time testing a plant that is not abundant.(b) Test only one part of one plant at a time.(c) Remember that eating large portions of plant food on an empty stomach may cause diarrhea, nausea, or cramps. Two good examples of this are such familiar foods as green apples and wild onions. Even after testing food and finding it safe, eat in moderation."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"31(2) Avoid plants with the following characteristics:Note: Using these guidelines in selecting plants for food may eliminate some edible plants; however,these guidelines will help prevent choosing potentially toxic plants.(a) Milky sap (Dandelion has milky sap but is safe to eat and easily recognizable).(b) Spines, fine hairs and thorns (skin irritants/contact dermatitis), (Prickly pear and thistles areexceptions. Bracken fern fiddleheads also violate this guideline).(c) Mushrooms and fungus.(d) Umbrella shaped flowers (Hemlock is eliminated).(e) Bulbs (Onions are the only thing that smell like onions).(f) Grain heads with pink, purplish or black spurs.(g) Beans bulbs or seeds inside pods.(h) Old or wilted leaves.(i) Plants with shiny leaves.(j) White and yellow berries (Aggregate berries such as black and dewberries are always edible, test all others before eating).(k) Almond scent in woody parts and leaves.d. Test Procedures:Note: Test all parts of the plant for edibility. Some plants have both edible and inedible parts. Neverassume a part that proved edible when cooked is edible raw, test the part raw before eating. The samepart or plant may produce varying reactions in different individuals.(1) Test only one part of a plant at a time.(2) Separate the plant into its basic components (Stems roots buds and flowers).(3) Smell the food for strong acid odors. Remember smell alone does not indicate a plant is edibleor inedible.(4) Do not eat 8 hours prior to the test and drink only purified water.(5) During the 8 hours you abstain from eating test for contact poisoning by placing a piece of the plant on the inside of your elbow or wrist. The sap or juice should contact the skin. Usually 15 minutes is enough time to allow for a reaction.(6) During testing take nothing by mouth except purified water and the plant you are testing.(7) Select a small portion of a single part and prepare it the way you plan to eat it.(8) Before placing the prepared plant in your mouth, touch a small portion (a pinch) to the outer surface of you lip to test for burning or itching.(9) If after 3 minutes there is no reaction on your lip, place the plant on your tongue, and hold it for 15 minutes.(10) If there is no reaction, thoroughly chew a pinch and hold it in your mouth for 15 minutes.DO NOT SWALLOW. If any ill effects occur rinse out your mouth with water.(11) If nothing abnormal occurs swallow the food and wait 8 hours. If any ill effects occur during"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"32 this period, induce vomiting and drink a water and charcoal mixture.(12) If no ill effects occur, eat ¼ cup of the same plant prepared the same way. Wait another 8 hours. If no ill effects occur, the plant part as prepared is safe for eating.Notes:1. Ripe tropical fruits should be peeled and eaten raw. If the fruit is soft, color does not always indicate ripeness. Cook unripe fruits and discard seeds and skin.2. Cook underground portions if possible to reduce possible bacterial contamination and ease digestion of their generally high starch content.3. During evasion you may not be able to cook.

A personal survival kit should be carried for such a contingency. The limiting factors for such kitsare bulk and weight. Three approaches to carrying personal survival kits should be considered: Scatter theitems throughout clothing so the weight bulk is distributed over the body. This is also good insuranceagainst loss of all of the kit, should a pocket not be fastened or ripped open. Pack items in one smallcontainer to make it easy to check for both location and contents.The third method is a combination of the first two. By making several small kits (i.e. fishing, medical,and repair kits) and scattering these sub-kits throughout clothing to accomplish one task. This alsodecreases the chance of losing the smaller items. The packing of these items, regardless of whichapproach is used, is also important. The containers must small, sturdy, without sharp corners, and mustprovide protection for the kit contents. Some good containers are; plastic soap dishes, dental flosscontainers, film canisters, Band-Aid boxes, small leather or canvas patches, aspirin tins, heavy plasticbags, etc. If the container has a survival function such as a water container or signal mirror, so much thebetter. Small sharp items i.e., hooks, files, needles, razors and saw blades, are easily taped to a piece ofthin cardboard and carried in a wallet.The following is list of items to choose from when designing a personal survival kit for combatemergency needs:Medical/Health Needs:Sterile dressingsPersonal medicationsSmall bar of odorless soapTweezersInsect repellentBetadine padsSalt and sugar packetsAspirinWater purification tablets/strawsMole skinChapstick/sunscreenHandi-wipesAssorted Band-AidsSafety pinsCarrying/Holding Water:Plastic bagsSurgical tubingPlastic sheetingWater tubingProphylacticsZiplock bagsHeavy aluminum foilBody Protection:Large plastic bagSpare wool socksSpace blanketBandana/neckerchiefEvasion chartNeck scarf/cravatFloppy hatGlovesWool watch capSunglasses"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"92PERSONAL SURVIVAL KITSCamouflage Aid:Camouflage sticks BurlapCamouflage compact Socks (disguise boot prints)NettingCammie scarfHeat/Fires:Matches (waterproof)Small candleCotton ballsLighterMetal matchMagnifying glassMagnesium blockPetroleum gauze padsRepairing/Improvising:Multi-bladed pocket knifePara 550 cordSingle edge razor blades Assorted needlesSmall sharpening stoneSafety pinsFlexible wire sawSafety wireDuct/electrical tapeHeavy threadNavigation/Travel:Evasion chartSignal mirrorArea topographic mapSpare radio batteryCompassPen lightSmall pencil WhistleSmall high quality monocularFood Procurement:Fish hooks (assorted)NetsSinkersLures/spinners/fliesBouillon cubesSnare wire"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"93RECOMMENDED READING LISTFIVE YEARS TO FREEDOMMaj.
