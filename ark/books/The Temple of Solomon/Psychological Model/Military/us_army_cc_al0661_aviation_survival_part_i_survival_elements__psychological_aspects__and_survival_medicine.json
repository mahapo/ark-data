Are they prepared? Can they handle the new mission, not knowingwhat it entails? Unfortunately, many aircrew members are not fully aware oftheir new mission or are not fully prepared to carry it out. All instructorsteaching aircrew survival must prepare the aircrew member to face andsuccessfully complete this new mission.b.The moment an aircrew member leaves the aircraft and encounters asurvival situation, the assigned mission involves two tasks. One task is to\"return to friendly control without giving aid or comfort to the enemy,\" andthe other is to \"return early and in good physical and mental condition.\"(1)On first impression \"friendly control\" seems to relate to acombat situation. Even in peacetime, however, the environment may be quitehostile. Imagine parachuting into the arctic when it's minus 40 degreesFahrenheit (°F). Would an aircrew member consider this friendly? No! Ifthe aircraft is forced to crash-land in the desert where temperatures maysoar above 120°F, would this be agreeable? Hardly. The possibilities forencountering hostile conditions affecting human survival are endless. Crewmembers who egress an aircraft may confront situations difficult to endure.1"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(2)Giving aid or comfort to the enemy is directly related to acombat environment. This part of the mission may be most effectivelyfulfilled by following the Code of Conduct (Figure 1). Remember, the Code ofConduct is useful to a survivor at all times and in all situations. Themoral obligations of this document apply to peacetime and wartime situations.(3)The final phase of the mission is \"to return early and in goodphysical and mental condition.\" A key factor in successfully completing thispart of the mission may be the will to survive. This will is present, invarying degrees, in all human beings. Although successful survival is basedon many factors, those who maintain this important attribute will increasetheir chance of success.c.Surviving is extremely stressful and difficult. The survivor may beconstantly faced with hazardous and difficult situations. The stresses,hardships, and hazards associated with a survival episode are caused by thecumulative effects of existing conditions. The survivor's mission forms thebasis for identifying and organizing the major needs of a survivor.d.The primary elements of the survivor's mission are: conditionsaffecting survival and survivor's needs and the means for surviving. Theseelements are covered in the following sections of this lesson.Section I. CONDITIONS AFFECTING SURVIVAL2.BASIC CONDITIONSFive basic conditions affect every survival situation (Figure 2). Theseconditions may vary in importance or degree of influence from one situationto another and from individual to individual. At the onset, these conditionscan be considered to be neutral--being neither for nor against the survivor-and should be looked on as neither an advantage nor a disadvantage. Theaircrew member may succumb to their effects--or use them to the bestadvantage. These conditions exist in each survival situation and have greatbearing on the survivor's every need, decision, and action.3.ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONSBasic components of all environments can present special problems for thesurvivor. Each component can be used to the survivor's advantage. Knowledgeof these conditions may very well contribute to the success of the survivalmission. These basic conditions include--a.Climate. Temperature, moisture, and wind are the basic climaticelements. Extreme cold or hot temperatures, complicated by moisture (rain,humidity, dew, and snow) or lack of moisture, and the possibility2"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"of wind may have a life-threatening impact on the survivor's needs,decisions, and actions. The primary concern, resulting from the effects ofclimate, is the need for personal protection. Climatic conditions also havea significant impact on other aspects of survival, such as the availabilityof water and food, the need and ability to travel, recovery capabilities, andphysical and psychological problems.Figure 1. Code of Conduct3AV0661"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Figure 2. Basic conditions that affect every survival situation.b.Terrain. Mountains, prairies, hills, and lowlands are only a fewexamples of the infinite variety of land forms that describe terrain. Eachland form has a different effect on a survivor's needs, decisions, andactions. A survivor may find a combination of several terrain forms in agiven situation. Existing terrain affects the survivor's needs andactivities in such areas as travel, recovery, sustenance, and, to a lesserextent, personal protection. Depending on its form, terrain may affordsecurity and concealment for an evader; cause travel to be easy or difficult;provide protection from cold, heat, moisture, wind, or nuclear, biological,chemical (NBC) conditions; or make surviving a seemingly impossible task.c.Life Forms. For survival and survival training purposes, there aretwo basic life forms--plant life and animal life other than human. Thespecial relationship and effects of people in the survival situation arecovered separately. Geographic areas are often identified in terms of theabundance of life (or lack thereof).EXAMPLE: The barren arctic or desert, primary or secondary forests,the tropical rain forest, and the polar ice cap produce images regarding thequantities of life forms. These examples have special meaning not only interms of the hazards or needs they create, but also in how a survivor can useavailable life forms (Figure 3).(1)Plant life. There are hundreds of thousands of different typesand species of plant life. In some instances, geographic areas areidentified by the dominant type plant life within that area. These areasinclude savannas, tundra, and deciduous forests. You may use many species ofplant life as a source of food, water, shelter, and camouflage.4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(2)Animal life. Birds, fish, insects, reptiles, mammals, andamphibians are life forms that directly affect a survivor. These creaturessatisfy needs or pose hazards which must be taken into consideration.Figure 3. Life forms.4.SURVIVOR'S CONDITIONThe survivor's condition and the influence it has in each survivalsituation is often overlooked. Primary factors that constitute thesurvivor's condition can best be described by the four categories shown inFigure 4. Aircrew members must prepare themselves in each of these areasbefore each mission and be in a state of constant readiness for thepossibility of a survival mission. Crew members must be aware of the role asurvivor's condition plays before and during the survival situation.Figure 4. Survivor's condition.5"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"a.Physical. Physical conditioning is one of the major factorsaffecting survivability. Aircrew members who maintain a high level ofphysical fitness are better prepared to face survival situations than thosewho do not. Good physical fitness will help the survivor to overcome suchdiverse hardships as temperature extremes, lack of rest, lack of food, and ashortage of water over an extended period of time.b.Psychological. The survivors' psychological state greatly influencestheir ability to successfully return from a survival situation.Psychological effectiveness in a survival situation (including captivity)results from effectively coping with the factors listed in Figure 5.Figure 5. Coping factors.(1)A survivor may experience emotional reactions during a survivalepisode due to the previously stated factors, previous life experiences(including training), and the survivor's psychological tendencies. Emotionalreactions commonly occurring in survival situations (including captivity) arelisted in Figure 6.6"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Figure 6. Emotional reactions.(2)Psychologically, survival situations may be divided into crisisand coping phases. The initial crisis period occurs at the onset of thesurvival situation. During this period, thinking as well as emotionalcontrol may be disorganized. Judgment is impaired and behavior may beirrational (possibly to the point of panic). Once the initial crisis isunder control, the coping phase begins, and the survivor is able to respondpositively to the situation. Crisis periods may well recur, especiallyduring extended situations (captivity). A survivor must strive to controlthe situation if unable to avoid it.(3)The most important psychological tool that affects the outcomeof a survival situation is the will to survive. Without it, the survivor issurely doomed to failure. In other words, a strong will best assuressurvival.c.Material. At the beginning of a survival situation, clothing andequipment in the aircrew member's possession, the contents of availablesurvival kits (Appendixes A and B), and salvageable resources from theparachute or aircraft are the survivor's total material assets. Adequatepermission preparations are required and must be stressed during training.Once the survival episode has started, give special attention to the use,care, and storage of all materials to ensure they continue to be serviceableand available. Clothing and equipment should be selectively augmented withimprovised items. Clothing appropriate to anticipated environmentalconditions (on the ground) should be worn or carried as long as aircraftspace and the mission permit. Equipment available to a survivor affects allneeds, actions, and decisions. Therefore, the survivor's ability toimprovise may provide a way to meet some of his needs.d.Legal and Moral Obligations. Whether in peacetime or combat, thesurvivor's responsibilities as a member of the military service continue.Legal obligations are expressly identified in the rules of the Geneva 7"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"convention, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and Army regulations andpolicies. Moral obligations are expressed in the Code of Conduct (Figure 1).(1)Other responsibilities influence behavior and the will tosurvive during survival situations. Examples include feelings of obligationor responsibilities to self, family, and spiritual beliefs.(2)A survivor's perception of responsibilities influences survivalneeds and affects his psychological state during and after the survivalsituation. These perceptions are reconciled either consciously throughrational thought or subconsciously through attitude changes. Trainingspecifically structured to foster and maintain positive attitudes provides akey asset to survival.5.TIME CONDITION (DURATION) The duration of the survival episode has a major effect on the aircrewmember's needs. Every decision and action is driven, in part, by anassessment of when recovery or return is probable. Air superiority, rescuecapabilities, distances involved, climatic conditions, ability to locate thesurvivor, or captivity are major factors that directly influence the duration(time condition) of the survival episode. A survivor can never be certainthat rescue is imminent.6.SOCIOPOLITICAL CONDITIONThe people a survivor contacts, their social customs, cultural heritage,and political attitudes affect the survivor's status. Warfare is one type ofsociopolitical condition, and people of different cultures are another.Because of these differences, the interpersonal relationship between thesurvivor and any people with whom contact is established is crucial tosurvival. To a survivor, the attitude of the people contacted is eitherfriendly, hostile, or unknown.a.Friendly People. The survivor who comes into contact with friendlypeople, or at least those willing (to some degree) to provide aid, isfortunate. Immediate return to home, family, or home station, however, maybe delayed. When in direct association with even the friendliest people, itis essential to maintain their friendship. These people may be of acompletely different culture in which a commonplace American habit may be agross and serious insult. In other instances, the friendly people may beactive insurgents in their country and constantly in fear of discovery.Every survivor action, in these instances, must be appropriate and acceptableto ensure continued assistance.8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"b.Hostile People. A state of war need not exist for a survivor toencounter hostility in people. With few exceptions, any contact with hostilepeople must be avoided. If captured, regardless of the political or socialreasons, the survivor must make all efforts to adhere to the Code of Conductand the legal obligations of the UCMJ, the rules of the Geneva convention,and Army policy.c.Unknown People. The survivor should consider all factors beforecontacting unknown people. Some primitive cultures and closed societies inwhich outsiders are considered a threat still exist. In other areas of theworld, differing political and social attitudes can place a survivor at riskwhen contacting an unknown people.7.INDUCED CONDITIONSAny form of warlike activity results in induced conditions. Threecomparatively new induced conditions may occur during combat operations.Nuclear warfare and the resultant residual radiation, biological warfare, andchemical warfare (also known as NBC) create life-threatening conditions fromwhich a survivor needs immediate protection. The longevity of NBC conditionsfurther complicates a survivor's other needs, decisions, and actions.Section II. THE SURVIVOR'S NEEDS AND MEANS FOR SURVIVING8.BASIC AND ADDITIONAL NEEDSThe three fundamental goals or duties of a survivor, when categorizedinto organizational components, are to maintain life, maintain honor, andreturn. These three goals may be further divided into five basic and threeadditional needs. In a noncombatant situation, these basic needs includehealth, travel, sustenance, communications (signaling for recovery), andpersonal protection. During combat, three additional needs must befulfilled-evasion; if captured, resistance; and escape. Meeting theindividual's needs during the survival episode is essential to achieving thesurvivor's fundamental goals. Survival training instructors and formalsurvival training courses provide training in the skills, knowledge, andattitudes necessary for an aircrew member to successfully perform fundamentalsurvival duties. However, the decisions survivors make and the actions theytake in order to survive determine their prognosis for survival.9.MAINTAINING LIFEIn any situation, there are three elementary needs of a survivor. Theseneeds, categorized as the integral components of maintaining life, arepersonal protection, sustenance, and physical and psychological health.9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"a.Personal Protection. Thehuman body is comparatively fragile.Without protection, the effects ofenvironmental conditions (climate,terrain, and life forms) and ofinduced conditions (radiological,biological, and chemical agents) maybe fatal. The survivor's primarydefenses against the effects of theenvironment are clothing, equipment,shelter, and fire. Additionally,clothing, equipment, and shelter arethe primary defenses against some ofthe effects of induced conditions(Figure 7).(1)The need for adequateclothing and its proper care and usecannot be overemphasized. The humanbody's tolerance for temperatureextremes is very limited. However,its ability to regulate heating andcooling is extraordinary. Theavailability of clothing and itsproper use is extremely important toa survivor while using theseabilities of the body. Clothingalso provides excellent protectionagainst the external effects ofalpha and beta radiation and mayserve as a shield against somechemical or biological agents.(2)Survival equipment,designed to aid survivors throughouttheir situation, must be cared forto maintain its effectiveness.Items found in a survival kit oraircraft can be used to help satisfythe eight basic needs. Quite often,however, a survivor must improviseto overcome an equipment shortage ordeficiency.Figure 7. Personal protection.10"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"NOTE: Information regarding survival kits and the survival vestis in Appendixes A and B.(3)The survivor's requirement for adequate shelter is based on theneed to avoid specific environmental extremes. In areas that are warm anddry, the survivor should seek natural and man-made shelter types that offerprotection from the effects of heat and direct sunlight. In cold climates,shelter requirements are completely different. In this climate, selecting ashelter design that enables the survivor to retain life-saving body heatbecomes the primary concern. In cold climates, the criticality of a shelteris measured in minutes. Rest is of little immediate concern in thisenvironment. Similarly, in areas of residual radiation, the criticality of ashelter is also measured in minutes. The duration of the survival episodeinfluences the selection of a shelter design and building materials.Ideally, the survivor will select a shelter design and building techniquethat requires the least amount of energy and time to construct (Figure 8).Figure 8. Shelters.(4)Fire also serves many survivor needs. It purifies water, cooksand preserves food, is used to signal, and provides a source of heat to warmthe body and dry clothing (Figure 9).b.Sustenance. Survivors need water and food to maintain normal bodyfunctions and to provide strength, energy, and endurance to overcome11"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"the physical stresses of survival. They must be constantly aware of the needfor water (Figure 10). The need for food, however, receives little attentionduring the first hours of a survival situation. During the first two orthree days, though, hunger becomes a nagging aggravation which can beovercome.Figure 9. “V\" Fire.Figure 10. Water.(1)The first major food crisis occurs when your physicalcapabilities are diminished. Signs include loss of energy, stamina, andstrength.(2)The second major food crisis is more insidious. A markedincrease in irritability and other attitudes may occur as the starvationprocess continues. Give early and continuous attention to obtaining andusing any and all available food. Since most people have food preferences,the natural tendency to avoid certain types of food is a major problem thatmust be overcome early. The starvation process ultimately overcomes all foodaversions. A successful survivor overcomes these aversions before physicalor psychological deterioration sets in (Figure 11).c.Health (Physical and Psychological). You must be your own nurse,doctor, corpsman, psychologist, and cheerleader. Self-aid is your solerecourse.(1)Prevention. The need for preventive medicine and safety cannotbe overemphasized. Attention to sanitation and personal hygiene is a majorfactor in preventing physical, morale, and attitudinal problems.(a)The need for cleanliness in treating injuries and illnessis self-evident. The prisoner of war (PW) who uses maggots to eat awayrotting flesh caused by infection is a dramatic example. Prevention ispreferred over such drastic procedures.12"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Figure 11. Food.(b)Safety must be foremost in the mind of the survivor;carelessness is caused by bad luck, ignorance, poor judgment, or all three.One miscalculation with a knife or an axe can result in a self-inflictedinjury or death.(2)Self-aid.(a)Injuries frequently occur during bailout, ditching, orcrash landing. Other postegress factors may also cause injury. In the eventof an injury, the survivor's existence may depend on his ability to performself-aid. In many instances, common first aid procedures suffice; in others,more primitive techniques are required (Figure 12).(b)Illness and the need to treat it is more commonlyassociated with long-term situations, such as an extended evasion episode orcaptivity. When preventive techniques have failed, the survivor must treatdisease symptoms in the absence of professional medical care.(3)Psychological health. Perhaps the survivor's greatest need isthe need for emotional stability and a positive, optimistic attitude. Anindividual's ability to cope with psychological stresses enhance successfulsurvival. Optimism, determination, dedication, and humor, as well as manyother psychological attributes, are all helpful to a survivor in overcomingpsychological stresses (Figure 13).10.MAINTAINING HONORA survivor may experience elementary needs during combat survivalsituations. These needs, categorized as integral components of maintaininghonor, include--13"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"a.Avoidance.(1)Evasion is one of the most difficult and hazardous situations asurvivor faces. No matter how difficult and hazardous evasion may be though,captivity is always worse.(2)During evasion you have two fundamental tasks. The first is touse concealment techniques. The second is to use evasive movementtechniques. Effective use of camouflage is common to both.Figure 12. Self-aid.Figure 13. Health and morale.14"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"(a)Hiding oneself and all signs of presence are the evader'sgreatest needs. Experience indicates that the survivor who uses effectiveconcealment techniques has a better chance of evading capture. Captureresults most frequently when the evader is moving.(b)The evader's need to move depends on a variety of needssuch as food, water, recovery, better shelter, and so on. Evasion movementis more successful when using proven techniques.b.Resistance (if Captured). The PW has a legal and moral obligation toresist the enemy. Resistance involves two distinctly different behaviors.The first form involves complying only with those directives that are legaland are authorized requirements. The second form of resistance involvesdisrupting enemy activity, subtle harassment, and tying up guards who couldbe used on the front lines.c.Escape (When Possible and Authorized). Escape is neither easy norwithout danger. The Code of Conduct states a survivor should make everyeffort to escape and to aid others to escape.11.RETURNINGThe need to return is satisfied by successfully completing one or all ofthe following basic tasks confronting the survivor:a.Aiding With Recovery. For survivors or evaders to effectively aid inrecovery, they must be able to make their position and the situation on theground known. This is done either visually, electronically, or both (Figure14).(1)Electronic signaling covers a wide spectrum of techniques. Asproblems such as security and safety during combat become significantfactors, procedures for using electronic signaling to facilitate recoverybecome increasingly complex.(2)The primary technique for attracting attention and pinpointingan exact location for rescuers is visual signaling. Simple messages orinformation may also be transmitted with visual signals.b.Traveling On Land. A survivor may need to move on land for a varietyof reasons ranging from going for water to attempting to walk out of thesituation. In any survival episode, the survivor must weigh the need totravel against his capabilities, safety, or both (Figure 15). Factors toconsider may include those listed below.(1)The ability to walk or traverse existing terrain. In a non-survival situation, a twisted or sprained ankle is an inconvenienceaccompanied by some temporary pain and restricted activity. A survivor wholoses his mobility (because of injury) to obtain food, water, and shelterfaces death.15"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Figure 14. Recovery.Figure 15. Travel.(2)The need to transport personal possessions (burden carrying).There are numerous documented instances of survivors abandoning equipment andclothing simply because carrying it was a bother. Later,16"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the materials were not available when needed to save a life or limb or to aidin a rescue. Burden carrying need not be difficult or physically stressful.There are many simple ways for a survivor to carry the necessities of life(Figure 16).Figure 16. Burden carrying.(3)The ability to determine present position. Maps, compasses,star charts, Weems plotters, and such permit accurately determining positionduring extended travel. Yet, the knowledgeable, skillful, and alert survivorcan do well without a full complement of these aids. Logic, constantawareness, and training in nature's clues to navigation may allow a survivorto determine his general location even in the absence of detailed navigationaids.(4)Restrictions or limitations to select and maintain a course oftravel. The tools used in determining position are also used to maintain acourse of travel. A straight line course to a destination is usually thesimplest, but it may not always be the best course for travel. Travelcourses may need to be varied for diverse reasons. Such reasons includegetting food or water, enhancing covert travels, or avoiding hazardous orimpassable obstacles or terrain. Careful planning and route selection areessential before and during travel.c.Traveling On Water. Two differing circumstances may requiresurvivors to travel on water. First, those who crash-land or parachute intothe open sea are confronted with one type of situation. Second, survivorswho find a river or stream leading in a desirable direction are faced with adifferent situation. In each instance, however, the common element is tostay afloat.(1)The survivor's initial problems on the open sea are oftendirectly related to the winds and size of the waves. Simply getting into aliferaft and staying there are often very difficult tasks. On the open 17"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"sea, winds and ocean currents have a significant effect on the direction oftravel. As the survivor comes closer to shore, the direction in which thetide is flowing also becomes a factor.(2)When compared to traveling overland, there are advantages anddisadvantages to using streams and rivers. Floating with the current is farless difficult and time consuming. Food and water are also found in greaterabundance near bodies of water. The hazards associated with river or streamtravel are numerous, especially during a time of war. The most serioushazard is the prospect of drowning. Actual evasion case histories revealthat the likelihood of being killed or captured is much greater near a movingbody of water. You must remember that the enemy, like yourself, also travelsusing the path of least resistance. The need to examine the advantages anddisadvantages of this form of travel cannot be overemphasized.18"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"REVIEW EXERCISEREQUIREMENT: Solve the following by selecting the correct answers:1.

In virtually any survival situation, theaircrew will be in an environment that can support human life. Thesurvivors' problems are compounded because they never really expected to bailout or crash-land in the jungle, over the ocean, or anywhere. No matter howwell prepared, aircrews probably will never completely convince themselvesthat it can happen to them. However, records show it can happen. Beforeaircrew members learn about the physical aspects of survival, they must firstunderstand that psychological problems may occur and that solutions must befound if the survival situation is to reach a successful conclusion.b.Survivors may depend more on their emotional reactions to a situationthan on weather, terrain, the enemy, nature of the in-flight emergency, andso forth. Whether they will panic from fear or use fear as a stimulant forgreater sharpness depends more on the survivor's reactions to the situationthan on the situation. Some of the most common reactions to stress arediscussed in section II.23"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"c.All psychological factors may be overcome by survivors if they canrecognize the problem, work out alternative solutions, decide on anappropriate course of action, take action, and evaluate the results. Perhapsthe most difficult step is deciding on an appropriate course of action.Survivors may face either one or several psychological problems.Psychological problems are quite dangerous and must be effectively controlledor countered for survival to continue.d.Survivors do not choose or welcome their fate and would escape it ifthey could. They are trapped in a world of seemingly total domination--aworld hostile to life and any sign of dignity or resistance. The survivalmission is not an easy one, but it is one in which success can be achieved.Certain concepts and ideas can help an aircrew member return. Having thewill to survive is what it's all about.Section I. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS2.STRESSa.Emotional aspects associated with survival must be completelyunderstood just as survival conditions and equipment. An important factorbearing on success or failure in a survival situation is the individual'spsychological state. Maintaining an even outlook depends on the individual'sability to cope with many factors. Some factors include--(1)Understanding how various physiological and emotional signs,feelings, and expressions affect bodily needs and mental attitude.(2)Managing physical and emotional reactions to stressfulsituations.(3)Knowing individual psychological and physical tolerance limits.(4)Exerting a positive influence on companions.b.Everyone's biological mechanisms aid in adapting to stress. Bodilychanges resulting from fear and anger tend to increase alertness and provideextra energy to either run away or fight. These and other mechanisms canhinder a person under survival conditions. For instance, a survivor in araft could cast aside reason and drink sea water to quench a thirst, orevaders in enemy territory, driven by hunger pangs, could expose themselvesto capture when searching for food. These examples illustrate how normalreactions to stress could create problems for a survivor.c.Two of the gravest threats to successful survival are concessions tocomfort and apathy. These represent attitudes that must be avoided. Tosurvive, a person must focus planning and effort on fundamental needs.24"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"(1)Comfort. Many people consider comfort their greatest need, yetit is not essential to human survival. Survivors must value life more thancomfort and be willing to tolerate heat, dirt, pain, hunger, itching, and anyother discomfort. Recognizing discomfort as temporary helps survivorsconcentrate on effective action.(2)Apathy. As the will to keep trying lessens, drowsiness, mentalnumbness, and indifference result in apathy. This usually builds slowly, butultimately it takes over and leaves a survivor helpless. Physical factorsalso contribute to apathy. Fatigue, weakness, injury, loss of body fluids(dehydration), or exhaustion from prolonged exposure to the elements are allconditions that can contribute to apathy. Proper planning and sounddecisions can help a survivor avoid these conditions. Finally, survivorsmust watch for signs of apathy in their companions and help prevent it.Signs of impending apathy include quietness, resignation, lack ofcommunication, loss of appetite, and withdrawal from the group. Preventivemeasures include activity and maintaining group morale by planning andgetting the organized participation of all members.d.Many common stresses cause reactions that can be recognized and dealtwith appropriately in survival situations. A survivor must understand thatstresses and reactions often occur at the same time. Although survivors facemany stresses, the following common stresses occur in virtually all survivalsituations: pain, hunger, fatigue, frustration, depression, cold and heat,isolation, insecurity, sleep deprivation, loss of self-esteem, thirst anddehydration, and loss of self-determination.3.PAINa.Pain, like fever, is a warning signal calling attention to an injuryor damage to some part of the body. It is discomforting but is not, initself, harmful or dangerous. Pain can be controlled, and in an extremelygrave situation, survival must take priority over giving in to pain (Figure17).b.The biological function of pain is to protect an injured part bywarning the individual to rest it or avoid using it. In a survivalsituation, normal pain warnings may have to be ignored in order to meet morecritical needs. People have been known to complete a fight with a fracturedhand, to run on a fractured or sprained ankle, to land an aircraft despiteseverely burned hands, and to ignore pain during periods of intenseconcentration and determined effort. Concentration and intense effort canactually stop or reduce the feeling of pain.c.A survivor must understand the following facts about pain. Despitepain, a survivor can move in order to live. Pain can be reduced byunderstanding its source and nature; recognizing it as a discomfort to betolerated; concentrating on necessities, such as thinking, planning, andkeeping busy; and developing confidence and self-respect. When personalgoals (maintaining life, honor, and returning) are valued highly enough, asurvivor can tolerate almost anything.25"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Figure 17. Pain.4.THIRST AND DEHYDRATIONa.The lack of water and its accompanying problems of thirst anddehydration are among the most critical problems facing survivors. Thirst,like fear and pain, can be tolerated if the will to carry on, supported bycalm, purposeful activity, is strong. Although thirst indicates the body'sneed for water, it does not indicate how much. If a person drinks onlyenough to satisfy his thirst, it is still possible to slowly dehydrate.Preventing thirst and the more debilitating dehydration is possible ifsurvivors drink plenty of water any time it is available, especially wheneating (Figure 18).b.When the body's water balance is not maintained, thirst anddiscomfort result. Ultimately, a water imbalance results in dehydration anddeath. The need for water will increase if the person is sick, is fearful,or expends a great deal of energy.c.Dehydration decreases the body's efficiency or ability to function.Minor degrees of dehydration may not have a noticeable affect on a survivor'sperformance, but as it becomes more severe, body functions becomeincreasingly impaired. Slight dehydration and thirst can also causeirrational behavior. One survivor described it as follows:“The next thing I remember was being awakened by an unforgettablesensation of thirst. I began to move about aimlessly and finallyfound a pool of water.\"26"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"\"We finally foundwater. In the water were twodead deer with horns locked.We went down to the water anddrank away. It was the bestdamned drink of water I ever hadin my life. I didn't taste thestench of the deer at all.\"While prevention is the best wayto avoid dehydration, virtuallyany degree is reversible simplyby drinking water.5.COLD AND HEATThe normal human bodytemperature is 98.6 degreesFahrenheit (°F). People areknown to have survived with bodytemperatures 20°F below normal,and up to 8°F above normal. Anydeviation, even as little as 1 or2 degrees, reduces efficiency.a. Cold, serious stress evenin mild degrees, lowersefficiency. Extreme cold numbsthe mind and dulls the will to doanything except get warm. Coldnumbs the body by lowering theflow of blood to the extremities;this results in sleepiness.Survivors have endured prolongedcold and dampness through food,shelter, exercise, and properhygienic procedures. When flyingin cold weather areas, wearingproper clothing and having the proper climaticsurvival equipment are essentialto enhance survivability. Onesurvivor described cold and itseffect in this manner.Figure 18. Thirst.\"Because of the cold water, my energy was going rapidlyand all I could do was to hook my left arm over oneside of the raft, hang on, and watch the low flyingplanes as they buzzed me. . . . As time progressed,the numbing increased . . . and even seemed toimpair my thinking.\" 27"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Another survivor remembered survival training and acted accordingly.\"About this time, my feet began getting cold. Iremembered part of the briefing I had received aboutfeet freezing, so I immediately took action. I thoughtabout my shoes and, with my jack knife, cut off thebottom of my Mark II immersion suit and put them overmy shoes. My feet immediately felt warmer, and therubber feet of the immersion suit kept the soles of myshoes dry.\"b.Just as numbness is the principal symptom of cold, weakness is theprincipal symptom of heat. Most people can adjust to high temperatures,whether in the hold of a ship or in a harvest field on the Kansas prairie.It may take from two days to a week before circulation, breathing, heartaction, and sweat glands are all adjusted to a hot climate. Beat stress alsoaccentuates dehydration. In addition to the problem of water, there are manyother sources of discomfort and impaired efficiency directly attributable toheat or environmental conditions in hot climates. Extreme temperaturechanges, from extremely hot days to very cold nights, are experienced indesert and plains areas. Proper use of clothing and shelters can decreasethe adverse effects of such extremes (Figure 19).Figure 19. Heat.c.Bright sun has a tremendous effect on the eyes and exposed skin. Dark glasses or improvised eye protectors are required when confronted withdirect sunlight or rays reflecting off the terrain. Previous sun-tanningprovides little protection; protective clothing is important.d.Blowing wind, in hot summer, has been reported to get on somesurvivors' nerves. Wind constitutes an additional source of discomfort anddifficulty in desert areas when it carriers particles of sand and dirt.Protection against sand and dirt can be provided by cutting small slits in apiece of cloth for vision and tying it around the head.28"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"e.Acute fear has been experienced among survivors in sandstorms andsnowstorms. This results from the terrific impact of the storm and itsobliteration of landmarks showing direction of travel. Finding or improvinga shelter for protection from the storm itself is important.f.Loss of moisture, drying of the mouth and mucous membranes, andaccelerated dehydration can be caused by talking or breathing through themouth. Survivors must learn to keep their mouths shut in desert winds andcold weather.g.Mirages and illusions of many kinds are common in desert areas.These illusions not only distort visual perception but sometimes account forserious incidents. In the desert, distances are usually greater than theyappear, and under certain conditions, mirages obstruct accurate vision.Inverted reflections are common occurrences.6.HUNGERA considerable amount of edible material (which survivors may notinitially regard as food) may be available under survival conditions. Hungerand semistarvation are more commonly experienced among survivors than thirstand dehydration. Research has revealed no evidence of permanent damage norany decrease in mental efficiency from short periods of total fasting (Figure20). The prolonged and rigorous Minnesota semistarvation studies duringWorld War II revealed the behavioral changes reflected in Figure 21.a.Frequently, in the excitement of some survival, evasion, and escapeepisodes, hunger is forgotten. Survivors have gone for considerable lengthsof time without food or awareness of hunger pains. Make every effort toprocure and consume food to reduce the stresses brought on by fooddeprivation. The physical and psychological effects described are reversedwhen food and a protective environment are restored. Returning to normal isslow, and the time necessary for the return increases with the severity ofstarvation. If food deprivation is complete and only water is ingested,hunger pangs disappear in a few days; even then depression and irritabilityoccur. The individual tendency is still to search for food to preventstarvation. Such efforts might continue as long as strength and self-controlpermit. When the food supply is limited, even strong friendships arethreatened.b.Food aversion may result in hunger. Adverse group opinion maydiscourage those who might try foods unfamiliar to them. In some groups, thebarrier would be broken by someone eating the particular food rather thanstarving. The solitary individual has only personal prejudices to overcomeand often tries strange foods.c.Controlling hunger during a survival situation is relatively easy ifyou can adjust to discomfort and adapt to primitive conditions. Thefollowing person would rather survive than be fussy:29"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"\"Some people would almost starve before eating thefood. There was soup made of lamb's head with thelamb's eyes floating around in it. . .. When therewas a new prisoner, I would try to find a seat next tohim so I could eat the food he refused.\"Figure 20. Hunger.Figure 21. Semistarvation behavioral changes.30"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"7.FRUSTRATIONa.Frustration occurs when a person's efforts are stopped either byobstacles blocking progress toward a goal or by not having a realistic goal.It also occurs if the feeling of self-worth or self-respect is lost (Figure22).Figure 22. Frustration.b.A wide range of environmental and internal obstacles can lead tofrustration. This often creates anger and is accompanied by a tendency toattack and remove the obstacles to goals. Frustration must be controlled bychanneling energies into a positive and worthwhile obtainable goal. Thesurvivor should complete the easier tasks before attempting more challengingones. This relieves frustration and instills self-confidence.8.FATIGUEIn a survival situation, a survivor must continually cope with fatigueand avoid the accompanying strain and loss of efficiency. A survivor must beaware of the dangers of overexertion. In many cases, a survivor may alreadybe experiencing strain and reduced efficiency as a result of other stresses.A survivor must judge his capacity to walk, carry, lift, or do necessarywork, and plan and act accordingly. During an emergency, considerableexertion may be necessary to cope with the situation. If an individualunderstands fatigue and the attitudes and feelings generated by various kindsof effort, that individual should be able to call on available energyreserves when needed (Figure 23).31"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Figure 23. Fatigue.a.A survivor must avoid complete exhaustion; complete exhaustion maylead to physical and psychological changes. A survivor should be able todistinguish between exhaustion and being uncomfortably tired. Although aperson should avoid working to complete exhaustion, in emergencies certaintasks must be done in spite of fatigue.(1)Rest, a basic factor in recovering from fatigue, is alsoimportant in resisting further fatigue. Rest (following fatiguing effort) isessential and must be sufficient to permit complete recovery; otherwise,residual fatigue accumulates and longer rest periods are necessary torecover. During the early stages of fatigue, proper rest provides rapidrecovery of muscular and mental fatigue. Sleep is the most complete form ofrest available and is basic to recover from fatigue.(2)Short rest breaks, during periods of extended stress, canimprove total output. Rest breaks provide opportunities for partial recoveryfrom fatigue and help reduce energy expenditure. They also increaseefficiency by enabling a person to take maximum advantage of planned rest.Boredom is relieved by breaking up the uniformity and monotony of the tasks.As a result, rest periods increase morale and motivation.(3)Survivors should rest before output starts declining. If restbreaks are longer, fewer may be required. When efforts are highly strenuousor monotonous, rest breaks should be more frequent. Those that providerelaxation are the most effective. In mental work, mild exercise may be morerelaxing. When work is monotonous, changes in activity, conversation, andhumor are effective relaxants. In deciding on the amount and frequency ofrest periods, the loss of efficiency resulting from longer hours of effortmust be weighed against the absolute requirements of the survival situation.32"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"(4)Fatigue can be reduced by working \"smarter.\" Practical waysinclude adjusting the pace of the effort (balancing the load, rate, and timeperiod) and adjusting the technique of work. Walking at a normal rate is amore economical effort than fast walking. The way in which work is done hasa great bearing on reducing fatigue. Economy of effort is most important.Rhythmic movements suited to the task are best.(5)Cooperation, mutual group support, and competent leadership areimportant factors in maintaining group morale and efficiency. This reducesstress and fatigue. A survivor usually feels tired and weary before thephysiological limit is reached. Feeling fatigued involves not only thephysical reaction to effort, but also subtle changes in attitudes andmotivation. Remember, a person has energy reserves to cope with an importantemergency even when feeling very tired.b.As in other stresses, even a moderate amount of fatigue reducesefficiency. To control fatigue, it is wise to observe a program of periodicrest. Because of the main objective--to establish contact with friendlyforces--survivors may overestimate their strength and risk exhaustion. Onthe other hand, neither an isolated individual nor a group leader shouldunderestimate the capacity of the individual or group on the basis offatigue. The only sound basis for judgment must be gained from training andpast experience. In training, a person should form an opinion of individualcapacity based on actual experience. Likewise, a group leader must form anopinion of the capacities of fellow aircrew members. The group quoted belowdidn't think.\"By nightfall, we were completely bushed. . . . Wedecided to wrap ourselves in the chute instead ofmaking a shelter. We were too tired even to build afire. We just cut some pine boughs, rolled ourselvesin the nylon and went to sleep . . . and so, ofcourse, it rained, and not lightly. We stood it untilwe were soaked, and then we struggled out and made ashelter. Since it was pitch dark, we didn't get thesags out of the canopy, so the water didn't all runoff. A lot of it came through. Our hip and leg jointsached as though we had acute rheumatism. Being wet andcold accentuated the pain. We changed positions everyten minutes, after gritting our teeth to stay put thatlong.\" 9.SLEEP DEPRIVATIONThe effects of sleep loss are closely related to those of fatigue.Sleeping at unaccustomed times, under strange circumstances, or missing partor all of the accustomed amount of sleep cause a person to react by feelingweary, irritable, and emotionally tense and losing some efficiency. Theextent of an individual's reaction depends on the amount of disturbance andother stress factors that may be present (Figure 24).33"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Figure 24. Sleep deprivation.a.Strong motivation is one of the principal factors in helping tocompensate for the impairing effects of sleep loss. Superior physical andmental conditioning, opportunities to rest, food and water, and companionshelp endure sleep deprivation. If a person is in reasonably good physicaland mental condition, sleep deprivation can be endured five days or morewithout damage, although efficiency during the latter stages may be poor. Aperson must learn to get as much sleep and rest as possible. Restorativeeffects of sleep are felt even after catnaps. In some instances, survivorsmay need to stay awake. Movement, eating, drinking, activity, andconversation are ways a person can stimulate the body to stay awake.b.When one is deprived of sleep, sleepiness usually comes in waves. Aperson may suddenly be sleepy immediately after feeling wide awake. Thefeeling soon passes, and the person is wide awake again until the next waveappears. As the duration of sleep deprivation increases, periods betweenwaves of sleepiness become shorter. The need to sleep may be so strong aftera long deprivation period that one becomes desperate and does careless ordangerous things in order to escape this stress.10.ISOLATIONAmong the most severe survival stresses during isolation are whensurvivors experience loneliness, helplessness, and despair. People oftentake their associations with family, friends, military colleagues, and othersfor granted. Survivors soon begin to miss the daily interaction with others.These, like other stresses, can be conquered. Isolation can be controlledand overcome by knowledge, understanding, deliberate countermeasures, and adetermined will to resist it (Figure 25).34"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Figure 25. Isolation.11.INSECURITYInsecurity is the feeling of helplessness or inadequacy resulting fromvaried stresses and anxieties. These anxieties may be caused by uncertaintyregarding individual goals, abilities, and the future. Feelings ofinsecurity may have widely different effects on your behavior. You shouldestablish goals that are challenging yet attainable. The better you feelabout your abilities to achieve goals and adequately meet personal needs, theless you feel insecure.12.LOSS OF SELF-ESTEEMLoss of self-esteem may occur in captivity. Self-esteem is the state orquality of having personal self-respect and pride. Lack or loss of self-esteem in survivors may bring on depression and a change in perspective andgoals. Humiliation and other factors brought on by the captor may cause thesurvivors to doubt their worth. Humiliation comes from the feeling of losingpride or self-respect by being disgraced or dishonored and is associated withthe loss of self-esteem. Prisoners of war (PWs) must maintain their pride.They must not become ashamed because they are PWs or because of the thingsthat happen to them as a result of being a PW. Survivors who lose face(personally and with the enemy) become more vulnerable to captor exploitationattempts. To solve this problem, survivors should try to maintain a properperspective about the situation and themselves. Their feelings of self-worthmay be bolstered if they recall the implied commitment in the Code ofConduct--PWs will not be forgotten (Figure 26).35"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Figure 26. Loss of self-esteem.13.LOSS OF SELF-DETERMINATIONA self-determined person is relatively free from external controls orinfluences over his actions. In everyday society, these controls andinfluences are the laws and customs of society and of the self-imposedelements of our personalities. In a survival situation, the controls andinfluences can be very different. Survivors may feel as if events,circumstances, and in some cases other people are in control of thesituation. Some factors that may cause individuals to feel they have lostthe power of self-determination are a harsh captor, captivity, bad weather,or rescue forces that make time or movement demands. This lack of self-determination is more perceived than actual. Survivors must decide howunpleasant factors will be allowed to affect their mental state. They 36"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"must have the self-confidence, fostered by experience and training, to livewith their feelings and decisions. They also must have the self-confidenceto accept responsibility for the way they feel and how they let thosefeelings affect them.14.DEPRESSIONAs a survivor, depression is the biggest psychological problem that hasto be conquered. It should be acknowledged that everyone has mental highsand lows. People experiencing long periods of sadness or other negativefeelings are suffering from depression. A normal mood associated with thegrief, sadness, disappointment, or loneliness that everyone experiences attimes is also depression. Most of the emotional changes in mood aretemporary and do not become chronic. Depressed survivors may feel fearful,guilty, or helpless. They may lose interest in basic life needs. Many casesinvolve pain, fatigue, appetite loss, or other physical ailments. Somedepressed survivors try to injure or kill themselves (Figure 27).Figure 27. Depression.a.Psychiatrists have several theories as to the cause of depression.Some feel a person who, in everyday life and under normal conditions,experiences many periods of depression would probably have a difficult timein a survival situation. Depression is a most difficult problem because itcan affect a wide range of psychological responses. The factors can becomemutually reinforcing.EXAMPLE: Fatigue may lead to depression, depression may increase thefeeling of fatigue, fatigue leads to deeper depression, and so on.37"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"b.Depression usually begins after a survivor has met the basic needsfor sustaining life (water, shelter, and food). Once these basic needs aremet, there is often too much time for that person to dwell on the past, thepresent predicament, and future problems. The survivor must be aware of thenecessity to keep the mind and body active to eliminate the feeling ofdepression. One way to keep busy (daily) is by checking and improvingshelters, signals, and food.Section II. EMOTIONAL REACTIONS15.FEARFear can either save a life or cost a life. Some people are at theirbest when scared. Many downed fliers, faced with survival emergencies, havebeen surprised at how well they remembered their training, how quickly theycould think and react, and how much strength they had. The experience gavethem new confidence. On the other hand, some become paralyzed when facedwith the simplest survival situation. Some have been able to snap themselvesout of it before it was too late. In other cases, a fellow aircrew memberwas on hand to assist. However, others have not been so fortunate and arenot listed among the survivors!a.A person's reaction to fear depends more on the individual than thesituation. This has been demonstrated in actual survival situations and inlaboratory experiments. It isn't always the physically strong or happy-go-lucky people who handle fear most effectively. Timid and anxious people havemet emergencies with remarkable coolness and strength.b.Anyone who faces life-threatening emergencies experiences fear. Fearis conscious when it results from a recognized situation (an immediateprospect of bailout) or when experienced as apprehension of impendingdisaster. Fear also occurs at a subconscious level and creates feelings ofworry, depression, uneasiness, or general discomfort. Fear may vary widelyin duration, intensity, and frequency and may affect behavior across thespectrum from mild uneasiness to complete disorganization and panic. Peoplehave many fears. Some are learned through personal experiences, and othersare deliberately taught to them. Fear in children is directed throughnegative learning, such as being afraid of the dark, noise, animals, orteachers. These fears may control behavior; a survivor may react to feelingsand imagination rather than to the problem.c.When fantasy distorts a moderate danger into a major catastrophe, orvice versa, behavior can become abnormal. There is a general tendency tounderestimate. This leads to reckless, foolhardy behavior. An effectivemethod 6f controlling fear is to deny that it exists. No sharp lines arebetween recklessness and bravery. Behavior must be checked constantly tomaintain proper control.38"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"d.One or more of the physical signs or symptoms in Figure 28 may occurin those who are afraid. However, they may also appear in circumstancesother than fear. Physical and psychological symptoms are listed in Figure 28.Figure 28. Signs and symptoms of fear.e.Throughout military history, many people have coped successfully withthe most strenuous odds. In adapting to fear, they found support in previoustraining and experience. There is no limit to human control of fear.Survivors must control fear and not run away from it. Appropriate actionsshould be to understand fear, admit it exists, and accept fear as reality.f.Training can help survivors recognize what individual reactions maybe. Prior training should assist survivors in learning to think, plan, andact logically, even when afraid. To effectively cope with fear, a survivormust try to keep in mind those abilities shown in Figure 29.g.Every person has goals and desires. The greatest values exercise thegreatest influence. Because of strong moral, religious, or patriotic values,people have been known to face torture and death calmly rather than revealinformation or compromise a principle. Fear, a normal reaction to danger,can kill or save lives. By understanding and controlling 39"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"fear through training, knowledge, and effective group action, fear can beovercome.Figure 29. Coping qualities.40"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"16.ANXIETYa.Anxiety is a universal human reaction. Its presence can be felt whenchanges occur that affect an individual's plans, safety, or methods ofliving. Anxiety and fear differ mainly in intensity. Anxiety is a milderreaction and specific causes may not be readily apparent; whereas, fear is astrong reaction to a specific, known cause. Anxieties are generally feltwhen individuals perceive something bad is about to happen. A commondescription of anxiety is butterflies in the stomach. Anxiety createsfeelings of uneasiness, general discomfort, worry, or depression. Commoncharacteristics of anxiety are resentment, indecision, fear of the future,and a feeling of helplessness (Figure 30).b.To overcome anxiety, the individual must adopt a simple plan. It isessential that you keep your mind off of your injuries and do somethingconstructive. For instance, one PW tried to teach English to the Chinese andto learn Chinese from them.Figure 30. Anxiety.17.PANICIn the face of danger, a person may panic or freeze and cease to functionin an-organized manner. He may have no conscious control over individualactions. Uncontrollable, irrational behavior is common in emergencysituations. Anybody can panic, but one may go to pieces more easily thananother. Panic is brought on by a sudden overwhelming fear and often canspread quickly. Every effort must be made to bolster morale and calm thepanic with leadership and discipline. Panic and fear have 41"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"the same signs and should be controlled in the same manner. The survivorbelow allowed pain to panic him.\"His parachute caught in the tree, and he found himself suspendedabout 5 feet above the ground . .. one leg strap was releasedwhile he balanced in this aerial position, and he immediatelyslipped toward the ground. In doing so, his left leg caught inthe webbing and he was suspended by one leg with his head down.Unfortunately, the pilot's head touched an ant hill and antsimmediately swarmed over him. Apparently, in desperation, theflier pulled his gun and fired five rounds into the webbingholding his foot. When he did not succeed in breaking theharness, he took his own life. It was obvious from thediscoverer's report that if the pilot had even tried to turnaround or to swing himself from his inverted position, he couldhave reached either the aerial roots or the latticed trunk of thetree. With these branches, he should have been able to pullhimself from the harness . . . . The fact that his head wasin a nest of stinging ants only added to his panic, which led tothe action that took his life.\" 18.HATEHate is a powerful emotion that can have positive and negative effects ona survivor. Understanding hate and its causes are the keys to learning howto control it. It is an acquired emotion rooted in a person's knowledge orperceptions. The accuracy or inaccuracy of the information is irrelevant tolearning to hate.a.A person, object, or anything that may be understood intellectually(political concepts or religious dogma) can promote feelings of hate. Thesefeelings (usually accompanied with a desire for vengeance, revenge, orretribution) have sustained former PWs through harsh ordeals. If anindividual loses perspective while under the influence of hate and reactsemotionally, rational solutions to problems may be overlooked and thesurvivor may be endangered.b.To effectively deal with this emotional reaction, the survivor mustexamine the reasons why the feeling is present. Once reasons have beendetermined, the survivor should decide what to do. Whatever approach isselected, it should be as constructive as possible. A survivor must notallow hate to control him.19.RESENTMENTResentment is experiencing an emotional state of displeasure orindignation toward some act, remark, or person that has been regarded ascausing personal insult or injury. Luck and fate may play a role in anysurvival situation. A hapless survivor may resent a fellow PW, travelpartner, and so forth if that other person is perceived to be enjoying asuccess or advantage not presently experienced by the observer. The 42"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"survivor must understand that events cannot always go as expected. It isdetrimental to morale and could affect chances of survival if resentment overanother's attainments become too strong. Imagined slights or insults arecommon. The survivor should try to maintain a sense of humor and perspectiveabout ongoing events and realize that stress and lack of self-confidence playroles in bringing on feelings of resentment.20.ANGERAnger is a strong feeling of displeasure and belligerence aroused by areal or supposed wrong. People become angry when they cannot fulfill a basicneed or desire which seems important. When anger is not relieved, it mayturn into a more enduring attitude of hostility, characterized by a desire tohurt or destroy the person or thing causing the frustration. When anger isintense, the survivor loses control. This may result in impulsive behaviorwhich may be destructive. Anger is a normal response that can serve a usefulpurpose when controlled carefully. If the situation warrants and there is nothreat to survival, one could yell, scream, take a walk, exercise vigorously,or get away from the source (if only for a few minutes). The followingperson could not control his anger (Figure 31):Figure 31. Anger.43"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"21.IMPATIENCEa.Psychological stresses brought about by impatience can manifestthemselves quickly in physical ways. Internally, the effects of impatiencecan cause changes in physical and mental well-being. Survivors who allowimpatience to control their behavior may find that their efforts prove to becounterproductive and possibly dangerous. For instance, evaders who don'thave the ability or willingness to suppress annoyance when confronted withdelay may expose themselves to capture or injury.b.Potential survivors must understand they have to bear pain,misfortune, and annoyance without complaint. In the past, many survivorshave displayed tremendous endurance (mental and physical) in times ofdistress or misfortune. While not every survivor is able to display suchstrength of character in all situations; each person should learn torecognize things which may make him impatient in order to avoid actingunwisely. The survivor below couldn't wait.\"I became very impatient. I had planned to wait until night totravel but I just couldn't wait. I left the ditch about noon andwalked for about two hours until I was caught.\" 22.DEPENDENCEThe captivity environment is the prime area where a survivor mayexperienced feelings of dependency. The captor will try to develop feelingsof need, trust, and support in prisoners. By regulating the availability ofbasic needs (food, water, clothing, social contact, and medical care),captors show their power and control over the prisoners' fate. Throughemphasizing the prisoner's inability to meet his own basic needs, captorsseek to establish strong feelings of prisoner dependency. This dependencycan make prisoners extremely vulnerable to captor exploitation. Byrecognizing this captor tactic the PW has the key to countering it.Survivors must understand that, despite captor controls, they control theirown lives. Meeting even one physical or mental need can provide a PW with avictory and the foundation for continued resistance against exploitation(Figure 32).23.LONELINESSLoneliness can be very debilitating during a survival situation. Somepeople learn to control and manipulate their environment and become moreself-sufficient while adapting to changes. Others rely on protectivepersons, routines, and familiarity with surroundings to function and obtainsatisfaction (Figure 33).a.The ability to combat loneliness during a survival situation must bedeveloped long before the situation occurs. Self-confidence and self-sufficiency are key factors in coping with loneliness. People develop theseattributes by developing and demonstrating competence in performing tasks.As the degree of competence increases, so does self-confidence and 44"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"self-sufficiency. Military training, specifically survival training, isdesigned to provide individuals with the competence and self-sufficiency tocope with and adapt to survival living.b.In a survival situation, the countermeasure to conquer loneliness isto plan, to be active, and to think purposely. Developing self-sufficiencyis the primary protection since all countermeasures in survival require thesurvivor to have the ability to practice self-control.Figure 32. Dependence.Figure 33. Loneliness.24.BOREDOMBoredom and fatigue are related and' frequently confused. Boredom isaccompanied by a lack of interest and may include strain, anxiety, ordepression. This is particularly true when no relief is in sight and theperson is frustrated. Relief from boredom must be based on correcting thebasic sources-repetition and uniformity. Boredom can be relieved by varyingmethods-rotating duties, taking rest breaks, broadening the scope of aparticular task or job, or other techniques of diversification. Theungratifying nature of a task can be counteracted by clearing up its meaning,objectives, and in some cases, its relation to the total plan. One survivorcouldn't think of anything to do, while another survivor invented somethingto do (Figure 34).45"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Figure 34. Boredom.25.HOPELESSNESSHopelessness stems from the negative feeling that, regardless of actionstaken, success is Impossible or the certainty that future events will turnout for the worst no matter what a person tries to do. Feelings ofhopelessness can occur at virtually any time during a survival situation.Survivors have experienced loss of hope in--a.Trying to maintain health due to an inability to care for sickness,broken bones, or injuries.b.Returning home alive.c.Seeing their loved ones again.46"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"d.Believing in their physical or mental ability to deal with thesituation.e.A person may begin to lose hope during situations where physicalexhaustion or exposure to the elements affects the mind. The term \"give upitis\" was coined in Korea to describe the feeling of hopelessness.During captivity, deaths occurred from no apparent cause. Individualsactually willed themselves to die. The original premise (in the minds ofsuch people) is that they are going to die. To them, the situation seemedtotally futile, and they had passively abandoned themselves to fate. It waspossible to follow the step-by-step process. The people who died withdrewthemselves from the group, became despondent, then lay down and gave up. Insome cases death followed rapidly.f.One way to treat hopelessness is to eliminate the cause of thestress. Rest, comfort, and morale building activities can help eliminatethis psychological problem. Another method is to make the person so angry hewants to get up and attack the tormentors. A positive attitude has apowerful influence on morale and combating the feeling of hopelessness.g.Since many stress situations cannot be dealt with successfully, itmay be necessary to work out a compromise solution. The action may entailchanging a survivor's method of operation or accepting substitute goals.h.Evaders faced with starvation may compromise with their conscienceand steal just this one time. They may ignore their food aversion and eatworms, bugs, or even human flesh. A related form of compromise is acceptanceof substitute means to achieve the same goals.Section III. THE WILL TO SURVIVE26.DEFINITIONThe will to survive is defined as the desire to live despite seeminglyinsurmountable obstacles (mental and physical). The tools for survival arefurnished by the military, the individual, and the environment. Survivaltraining comes from training publications, instruction, and the individual'sown efforts. These are not enough without a will to survive. In fact,records prove that \"will\" alone has been the deciding factor in many survivalcases. These accounts are not classic examples of how to survive, but theyillustrate that a single-minded survivor with a powerful will to survive canovercome most hardships. There are cases where people have eaten their beltsfor nourishment, boiled water in their boots to drink as broth; or have eatenhuman flesh-though this certainly wasn't their cultural instinct.a.One incident where the will to survive was the deciding factorbetween life and death involved a person stranded in the desert for eight 47"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"days without food and water. He traveled more than 150 miles during searingdaytime temperatures and lost 25 percent of his body weight because of thelack of water (usually 10 percent loss causes death). His blood became sothick that the lacerations he received could not bleed until he had beenrescued and received large quantities of water. When he started on thatjourney, something must have clicked in his mind telling him to live,regardless of any obstacles he might confront. Live he did--on guts and willalone (Figure 35)! Figure 35. Will to survive.b.Let's flip a coin and check the other side of will. Our location isthe wilderness. A pilot ran into engine trouble and chose to deadstick theplane onto a frozen lake rather than punch out. He did a beautiful job andslid to a stop in the middle of the lake. He examined the aircraft fordamage. After surveying the area, he noticed a wooded shoreline only 200yards away where food and shelter could be provided--he began walking in thatdirection. Approximately halfway, he changed his mind and returned to thecockpit of the aircraft where he smoked a cigar, took out his pistol, andblew his brains out. Less than 24 hours later, a rescue team found him. Whydid he give up? Why was he unable to survive? Why did he take his own life?On the other hand, why do people eat their belts or drink broth from theirboots? No one really knows, but it's all related to the will to survive.27.OVERCOMING STRESSThe ability of the mind to overcome stress and hardship becomes mostapparent when-there appears to be little chance of a person surviving. Whenthere appears to be no escape from the situation, the \"will\" enables a personto begin to win \"the battle of the mind.\" This mental attitude can bridgethe gap between the crisis and coping periods.48"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"a.Crisis Period.(1)This is the point at which the person realizes the gravity ofthe situation and understands the problem will not go away. At this stage,action is needed! Most people experience shock in this stage as a result ofnot being ready to face this new challenge. Most recover control of theirfaculties, especially if they have been prepared through knowledge training.(2)Shock during a crisis is normally a response to being overcomewith anxiety. Thinking is disorganized. At this stage, direction isrequired because the individual is being controlled by the environment. Theperson's center of control is external. In a group survival situation, anatural leader may direct and reassure the others. If the situationcontinues to control the individual or group, the response may be panic,behavior may be irrational, and judgment is impaired. In a lone-survivorsituation, the individual must gain control of the situation and respondconstructively. In either case, a survivor must evaluate the situation anddevelop a plan of action. During the evaluation, the survivor must determinethe most critical needs to improve the chance of living and being rescued.b.The Coping Period. The coping period begins after the survivorrecognizes the gravity of the situation and resolves to endure it rather thansuccumb. The survivor must tolerate the physical and emotional effects ofstress. These effects can cause anxiety which becomes the greatest obstacleto self-control and solving problems. Coping with the situation requiresconsiderable internal control. Those who fail to think constructively maypanic. This could begin a series of mistakes which result in furtherexhaustion, injury, and sometimes death. Death comes not from hunger painsbut from the inability to manage or control emotions and thought processes.The survivor must often subdue urgent desires to travel when that would becounterproductive and dangerous. A person must have patience to sit in anemergency shelter while confronted with an empty stomach, aching muscles,numb toes, and suppressed feelings of depression and hopelessness.28.ATTITUDEThe survivor's attitude is the most important element of the will tosurvive. With the proper attitude, almost anything is possible. The desireto live is sometimes based on the feelings toward another person or thing.Love and hatred, two emotional extremes, have moved people to do exceptionalthings (physically and mentally). The lack of a will to survive cansometimes be identified by the individual's lack of self-esteem; lack ofmotivation to meet essential survival needs; and lack of emotional controlresulting in reckless, paniclike behavior.a.The will to survive must strengthen during an emergency. The firststep is to avoid a tendency to panic or fly off the handle. Sit down, relax,and analyze the situation rationally. Once thoughts are 49"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"collected and thinking is clear, the next step is to make decisions. Innormal living, people can avoid decisions and let others do their planning.This seldom works in a survival situation. Failure to decide on a course ofaction is actually a decision for inaction. This lack of decision making mayresult in death. However, decisiveness must be tempered with flexibility andplanning for unforeseen circumstances.EXAMPLE: An aircrew member down in an arctic nontactical situationdecides to construct a shelter for protection from the elements. Theplanning and actions must allow sufficient flexibility for the aircrew tomonitor the area for an indication of rescuers and for them to be prepared tomake contact (visually or electronically) with the potential rescuers.b.Tolerance is the next topic of concern. A survivor or evader has todeal with many physical and psychological discomforts; that is, unfamiliarinsects, animals, loneliness, and depression. Aircrew members are trained totolerate uncomfortable situations. That training must be applied whendealing with environmental stresses.c.Survivors in tactical and nontactical situations must face andovercome fears to strengthen the will to survive. Fears may be founded orunfounded, generated by the survivor's uncertainty or lack of confidence, orbased on the proximity of enemy forces. Indeed, fear may be caused by a widevariety of real and imagined dangers. Despite the source of the fear,survivors must recognize it and make a conscious effort to overcome it.29.OPTIMISMOne of a survivor's key assets is optimism-hope and faith.

BASIC SURVIVAL MEDICINETASK:9103.01-0002, Maintain Physical Capability to Survive.OBJECTIVE:You will be able to describe the basic survival medicines.CONDITIONS:You may use the lesson text and references to complete thereview exercise.STANDARD:You should answer correctly at least five of seven reviewexercise questions.REFERENCES:ARs 95-17 (May 84), 350-30 (Dec 85), 525-90 (Nov 71, withchanges 1 and 2); AFM 64-5 (Sep 85); FMs 1-302 (Sep 83, withchange 1), 20-150 (Jul 73, with changes 1 through 5), 21-76(Mar 86); and DOD Directive 1300.7 (Dec 84).LESSON TEXT1.GENERALa.Foremost, among the many things that can compromise a survivor'sability to return are medical problems. Injuries commonly associated with acrash or forced landing are sprains, burns, fractures, dislocations, andother types of wounds.b.Injuries and illnesses peculiar to certain environments can reducesurvival expectance. In cold climates, and often in an open sea survivalsituation, exposure to extreme cold can produce serious tissue trauma, suchas frostbite or death from hypothermia. Exposure to heat in warm climates,and in certain areas on the open seas, can produce heat cramps, heatexhaustion, or life-threatening heatstroke.c.Illnesses contracted during evasion or in a captivity environment caninterfere with successful survival. Among these are typhus, malaria,cholera, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and skininfections and infestations.d.A review of the survival experiences from World War II, Korea, andSoutheast Asia indicates that, while US military personnel generally knew howto administer first aid to others, there was a marked inability to administerself-aid. Only basic medical care had been taught to most military members.Repeated emphasis was that even minor injuries or ailments, when ignored,became major problems in a survival situation. Thus, prompt attention to themost minor medical problem is essential in a survival episode. Applyingprinciples of survival medicine should enable 55"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"military members to maintain health and wellbeing in a hostile or non-hostileenvironment until rescued and returned to friendly control.e.Information in this lesson is a basic reference to self-aidtechniques and techniques found in folk medicine. The information describesprocedures that can maintain health in medically austere situations. Itincludes items used to prevent and treat injuries and illnesses. Becausethere is no typical survival situation, the approach to self-aid must beflexible, placing emphasis on using what is available to treat the injury orillness. Medical treatment offered by people of other cultures may be fardifferent from our own. Such treatment may be repugnant to some US militarypersonnel; however, medical aid offered to survivors in non-US cultures maybe the best available in the given circumstance.EXAMPLE: In rural areas of Vietnam, a poultice of python meat is usedto treat internal lower back pain.f.The procedures in this lesson must be viewed in the reality of a truesurvival situation. The results of treatment may be substandard comparedwith present medical standards. However, these procedures will notcompromise professional medical care that becomes available following rescue.Moreover, in the context of a survival situation, they may represent the bestavailable treatment to extend the individual's survival expectance.2.PROCEDURES AND EXPEDIENTSSurvival medicine encompasses required and available procedures andexpedients to preserve health and to prevent, improve, or treat injuries andillnesses. They are also suitable to be self-applied by nonmedical personnelor applied to comrades in survival situation circumstances.a.Survival medicine is more than first aid in the conventional sense.It approaches final definitive treatment in that it does not depend on theavailability of technical medical assistance within a reasonable period.b.To avoid duplicating information generally available, the basicprinciples of first aid are not repeated. Psychological factors affectingsurvival were covered in lesson 2.3.HYGIENEIn a survival situation, cleanliness is essential to prevent infection.Adequate personal cleanliness not only protects against disease germs presentin the individual's surroundings, but it also protects the group by reducingthe spread of these germs (Figure 36).a.Washing (particularly the face, hands, and feet) reduces the chancesof infection from small scratches and abrasions. A daily bath or shower withsoap and hot water is ideal. If no tub or shower is 56"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"available, the body should be cleaned with a cloth and soapy water, payingparticular attention to the face, ears, hands, feet, and body creases(armpits, groin, and so forth). After this type of bath, the body should berinsed thoroughly with clear water to remove all traces of soap which couldcause irritation. Soap, although an aid, is not essential to keeping clean.Sand, ashes, loamy soil, and other expedients may be used to clean the bodyand cooking utensils.Figure 36. Hygiene.b.When water is in short supply, the survivor should take an air bath.All clothing should be removed and the body simply exposed to the air.Exposure to sunshine is ideal, but even on an overcast day or indoorsexposing the naked body to the air for two hours refreshes the body. Careshould be taken to avoid sunburn when bathing in this manner. Exposure inthe shade, shelter, or sleeping bag helps if the weather conditions do notpermit direct exposure.c.Hair should be kept trimmed, preferably to 2 inches or less, and theface should be clean-shaven. Hair provides a surface for parasite attachmentand bacterial growth. Keeping the hair short and the face clean-shavenprovides less habitat for these organisms. Wash the hair with soap and waterat least weekly. When water is in short supply, comb or brush the hairthoroughly and cover it to keep it clean. Inspect the hair weekly forparasites and remove them if they exist.d.Unclean hands is the principal means of infecting food and openwounds. They should be washed with soap and water, if available, afterhandling any material likely to carry germs. This is especially importantafter each visit to the latrine; when caring for the sick and injured; and 57"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"before handling food, food utensils, or drinking water. Keep fingers out ofthe mouth, and closely trim and clean fingernails. A scratch from a longfingernail could develop into a serious infection.4.ORAL CAREa.To prevent tooth decay and gum disease, cleanse the mouth and teeththoroughly with a toothbrush and dentifrice at least once each day.If a toothbrush is not available, a \"chewing stick\" can be fashioned from atwig. Wash the twig, then chew on one end until it is frayed and brush-like.Teeth can then be brushed thoroughly with the stick. If necessary, wrap aclean strip of cloth around the finger and rub on the teeth to wipe away foodparticles. If neither toothpaste nor toothpowder is available, salt, soap,or baking soda can be used. Gargling and rinsing with willow bark tea helpsprotect the teeth.b.Food debris that has accumulated between the teeth should be removedby using dental floss or toothpicks. The parachute inner core filaments canbe separated and used as dental floss. Small twigs can be used fortoothpicks. Stimulate gum tissues daily by rubbing them vigorously with aclean finger.c.Use as much care in cleaning dentures and other dental appliances(removable or fixed) as cleaning natural teeth. Remove and clean denturesand removable bridges with a denture brush or chew stick at least once eachday. Brush or rub regularly the tissue under the dentures for properstimulation. Remove dental appliances at night or for a two- or three- hourperiod during the day.5.FOOT CAREOf utmost importance in a survival situation is proper care of the feet,especially if the survivor has to travel. Serious foot trouble can beprevented by observing a few simple rules.a.Feet should be washed, dried thoroughly, and massaged daily. Ifwater is in short supply, air clean the feet along with the rest of the body.Trim toenails straight across to prevent ingrown toenails.b.Break in boots before wearing them on any mission. They should fitproperly, neither so tight that they bind and cause pressure spots nor soloose that they permit the foot to slide forward and backward when walking.Improvise insoles to reduce any friction spots inside the shoes.c.Socks should be large enough to allow the toes to move freely but notso loose that they wrinkle. Wool socks should be at least one size largerthan cotton socks to allow for shrinkage. Socks with holes should beproperly darned before they are worn. Wearing socks with holes or thosepoorly repaired may cause blisters. Clots of wool on the inside and outsideshould be removed from wool socks because they may cause blisters. Changeand wash socks thoroughly with soap and water daily. Wash woolen 58"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"socks in cool water to lessen shrinkage. In camp, stretch freshly launderedsocks to facilitate drying in the sun or in an air current. While traveling,damp socks can be dried by placing them inside layers of clothing or hangingthem on the outside of the pack. If socks are damp, exchange them for dryones.d.When traveling, examine the feet regularly for red spots or blisters.Cover tender areas with adhesive tape to prevent blister formation.6.CLOTHING AND BEDDINGClothing and bedding become contaminated with any disease germs that maybe present on the skin, or in the stool or urine, or in nose and throatsecretions. Therefore, keep clothing and bedding as clean as possible todecrease the chances of skin infection and the possibility of parasiteinfestation. Wash soiled outer clothing with soap and water. Changeunderclothing and socks daily. If water is in short supply, air cleanclothing. For air cleaning, take clothing outdoors and air and sun for twohours. Wear air-cleaned clothing in rotation. Turn sleeping bags insideout, fluff, and air them after each use. Change bed linen at least once aweek; air and sun blankets, pillows, and mattresses (Figure 37).Figure 37. Bedding.7.RESTa.Rest is necessary for the survivor because it restores physical andmental vigor and promotes healing. In the initial stage of the survivalsituation, rest is particularly important. After tasks requiring 59"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"immediate attention are complete, inventory available resources, decide on aplan of action, and have a meal. This planning session provides a restperiod without a feeling of doing nothing.b.If possible, plan regular rest periods daily. Time allotted for restdepends on a number of factors including the survivor's physical conditionand the presence of hostile forces. Usually, 10 minutes each hour issufficient. During rest periods, change either from physical activity tocomplete rest or from mental activity to physical activity as the case maybe. Survivors must learn to become comfortable and to rest under less thanideal conditions.8.INJURY MANAGEMENTa.Breathing. Lack of breathing is a life-threatening emergency thatrequires immediate attention. If the problem is the result of an acute upperairway obstruction and other resuscitation methods have failed, then animmediate cricothyroidotomy (an artificial airway) may be required to savethe individual's life. A cricothyroidotomy is an opening in the tracheabetween the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage that permits air topass directly from the outside into the trachea without passing through theupper air passages. A cricothyroidotomy is performed as stated in Figure 38.CAUTION: This procedure requires specific knowledge and training.Nonmedical personnel should perform it only in a combat survival situationand only as a last resort.b.Bleeding. It is most important to control bleeding in survivalsituations where replacement transfusions are not possible. Take immediatesteps to stop the flow of blood, regardless of its source. Use the methodcommensurate with the type and degree of bleeding. The tourniquet, whenrequired and properly used, saves lives; if improperly used, it may cost alife. The basic characteristics of a tourniquet and ways to use it arecovered in standard first-aid texts; however, certain points merit emphasisin the survival situation. Use a tourniquet only after every alternativemethod has been attempted. Gradually loosen the tourniquet after 20 minutesif it is determined that medical assistance will not be available for morethan two hours after applying it. If bleeding has stopped, remove thetourniquet; if bleeding continues, reapply and leave it in place. Apply thetourniquet as near the bleeding as possible, between the wound and the heart,to reduce the amount of tissue lost.c.Pain.(1) Controlling pain.(a) Controlling pain is difficult and essential. In additionto its morale-breaking discomfort, pain contributes to shock and makes thesurvivor more vulnerable to enemy influences. Ideally, pain60"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"should be eliminated. However, this is not always possible, hence measuresfor pain control are beneficial.Figure 38. Cricothyroid membrane location.61"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"(b)The part of the body that is hurting should be put at rest,or at least its activity restricted. The position selected should be the onegiving the most comfort and the easiest to maintain. Splints and bandagesmay be necessary to maintain immobilization. Elevation of the injured part,with immobilization, is particularly beneficial in throbbing pain. Cleanseopen wounds, remove foreign bodies, and apply a clean dressing to protect thewound from the air. Generally, warmth reduces pain (toothache and bursitis);however, in some conditions, applying cold has the same effect (strains andsprains). Warmth or cold is best applied by using water due to its highspecific heat. The survivor then can try to determine which is mostbeneficial.(2) Reducing pain.(a)Drugs are very effective in reducing pain; however, theyprobably will not be available in a survival situation. Aspirin, APCs, andsuch tablets are primarily intended to combat the discomforts of colds andupper respiratory diseases. These drugs just take the edge off severe painbut should be taken if available. If no aspirin is available, there are someparts of vegetation that can be used.(b)Most willows have been used for their pain-relieving andfever-lowering properties for hundreds of years. Fresh bark contains salicinwhich probably decomposes into salicylic acid in the human body. The leavesof wintergreen (checkerberry) made into a tea were used by some Indians forbody aches and pains. The boiled bark of the magnolia tree helps relieveinternal pains and fever and has been known to stop dysentery.(c)To be really effective in controlling pain, strongernarcotic drugs are required. During active hostilities, morphine may beavailable in aircraft and individual first-aid kits.d.Shock.(1)Circulatory reaction. Shock in some degree accompanies all bodyinjuries; frequently, it is the most serious consequence. In essence, shockis a circulatory reaction of the body to an injury. Changes to thecirculatory system initially favor body resistance to the injury (by ensuringadequate blood supply to vital structures), but these changes may progress tocirculatory failure and death. All aircrew members should be familiar withthe signs and symptoms of shock so that it may be anticipated, recognized,and dealt with effectively. However, the best survival approach is to treatall moderate and severe injuries for shock. No harm is done, and suchtreatment speeds recovery.(2)Fluids. Normally, fluids administered by mouth are generallyprohibited in the treatment of shock following severe injury. When given bymouth, such fluids are poorly absorbed and may interfere with administrationof anesthesia for surgery. In survival medicine, however, the situation isdifferent in that the treatment being given is the final 62"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"treatment. Survivors cannot be deprived of water for long periods becausethey are injured; in fact, recovery depends on adequate hydration. Smallamounts of tea, coffee, or warm water given frequently early in shock arebeneficial if the patient is conscious, can swallow, and has no internalinjuries. In later shock, fluids by mouth are less effective as they are notabsorbed from the intestines. Burns, particularly, require large amounts ofwater to replace fluid lost from injured areas. Alcohol should never begiven to a person in shock or one who may go into shock.(3) Psychogenic shock. Psychogenic shock is frequently notedimmediately following an emergency, as in a bailout. Psychogenic shock,which occurs even without injury, requires attention to limit it in degreeand duration. The degree of this postimpact shock varies widely amongindividuals, but its occurrence is almost universal. In reality the survivorhas passed through two major emergencies almost simultaneously: the aircraftincident leading to the survival situation and the situation itself. Shouldthe survivor be injured (and the majority are), a third emergency is added.It is not uncommon, then, that some psychogenic reaction with circulatoryimplications occurs. Resistance to this type of shock depends on theindividual's personality and amount of training previously received.Treatment consists of stopping all activities (when possible), relaxing,evaluating the situation, and formulating a plan of action before thesurvival situation begins.9.INJURIESa.Head Injuries.(1)Head injuries pose additional problems related to brain damageas well as interfering with breathing and eating. Bleeding is more profuseabout the face and head area, but infections have more difficulty takinghold. This makes it somewhat safer to close such wounds earlier to maintainfunction. A cricothyroidotomy may be necessary if breathing becomesdifficult because of an obstruction of the upper airways.(2)In the event of unconsciousness, watch the patient closely andkeep him still. Even in the face of mild or impending shock, keep the headlevel or slightly elevated if there is reason to expect brain damage. Do NOTgive fluids or morphine to unconscious persons.b.Chest Injuries. Chest injuries are common, painful, and disabling.Severe chest bruises or rib fractures require that the chest be immobilizedto prevent painful movements of the chest wall. Apply the bandage while thepatient deeply exhales. In the survival situation, it may be necessary foryou to wrap your own chest. This is more difficult but can be done byattaching one end of the long bandage (parachute material) to a tree or otherfixed object. While holding the other end in the hand, slowly roll your bodytoward the tree. Be sure to keep enough counterpressure on the bandage toensure a tight fit.63"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"c.Eye Injuries. Eye injuries are quite serious in a survival situationbecause of pain and interference with other survival functions. Thetechniques for removing foreign bodies and for treating snow blindness arecovered in standard first aid manuals. More serious eye injuries thatdisrupt the contents of the orbit may require the lids of the affected eye betaped closed or covered to prevent infection.d.Thorns and Splinters. To reduce the danger of encountering thornsand splinters in survival situations, wear gloves and proper footgear.Promptly remove these agents to prevent infection. Wounds made by theseagents are deeper than their width which increases chances of infection bythose organisms (tetanus) which grow best in the absence of oxygen. Removesplinters with a sharp instrument (needle or knife), needle-nose pliers, ortweezers. Take care to get all of the foreign body out; sometimes it is bestto open the wound sufficiently to properly cleanse it and allow air to enterthe wound. When cleaned, treat it as any other wound.e.Blisters and Abrasions. Foot care is extremely important in thesurvival situation. Care for blisters and abrasions promptly. If you noteredness or pain, stop (if at all possible) to find and correct the cause.Frequently, a protective dressing, bandage, or adhesive is sufficient toprevent a blister. If a blister does occur, do NOT remove the top layer ofskin. Opening a blister provides entry for infection. Clean the area withantiseptic, if available, and apply a clean dressing. Treat all openblisters and abrasions in the same manner.f.Insect Bites. Bites of insects, leaches, ticks, fleas, and chiggerspose several hazards. Many of these organisms transmit lethal diseases, andthe bite itself is likely to become infected if it is repeatedly scratched.You should inspect your body frequently for all types of animal parasites andremove them as soon as they are detected. Pay particular attention to areassuch as the folds of the skin. Leaches are best removed by applying heat orsome other irritant to encourage them to relax their hold on your skin.Ticks, on the other hand, should not be removed with the aid of a heat sourcebecause it increases the likelihood that contaminants will be expelled intothe bite area. Remove ticks by grasping as much of their body as possibleand pulling with steady pressure until it releases its hold on the skin. Youcan reduce your exposure to animal parasites by avoiding the shady or woodedareas immediately adjacent to open fields. Treat such wounds as any otherwound. Apply a cold wet dressing to reduce itching, scratching, and swelling.g.Fractures.(1)Proper immobilization of fractures, dislocations, and sprains iseven more important in survival medicine than in conventional first aid. Insurvival medicine rather than merely making the patient comfortable duringtransport to eventual treatment; the initial immobilization is part of theultimate treatment. Although immobilizing body parts to help control painhelps, immobilization in the proper position hastens 64"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"fracture healing and improves the ultimate functional result. In thesurvival situation, immobilization must suffice for a relatively long periodof time. Materials for splinting and bandaging are available in mostsurvival situations. Proper techniques are detailed in most first-aidmanuals.(2)Reducing (setting) fractures is normally beyond the scope offirst aid; however, in the prolonged survival situation, correcting bonedeformities is necessary to hasten healing and obtain the greatest functionalresult. The best time for manipulation of a fracture is in the periodimmediately following the injury, before painful muscle spasms ensue. Applytraction until overriding bone fragments are brought into line (check by theother limb) and the extremity is firmly immobilized. Frequently, it isadvantageous to continue traction after reduction to ensure proper bonealignment.(3)Since plaster casts are not available in the survival situation,improvising an immobilization device is necessary. This may be done by usingseveral parallel, pliable willow branches woven together with vines orparachute lines. Use care so that the extremity is not constricted whenswelling follows the injury. In an escape and evasion situation, it may benecessary to preserve the mobility of the survivor after reducing thefracture. This is difficult in fractures of the lower extremities, althoughtree limbs may be improvised as crutches. With companions, using improvisedlitters may be possible.(4)Reducing dislocated joints is similar to that of fractures.Apply gentle, but firm, traction and manipulate the extremity until it\"snaps' back into place. If the survivor is alone, the problem iscomplicated but not impossible. Traction can still be applied by usinggravity. Tie or wedge the distal (furthest) portion of the extremity to thefork of a tree or similar fixation point. Then allow the weight of the bodyto exert the necessary traction, manipulating the joint until the dislocationis reduced.h.Burns.(1)Burns, frequently encountered in aircraft accidents andsubsequent survival situations, pose serious problems. Burns cause severepain, increase the probability of shock and infection, and offer an avenuefor considerable body fluid and salt loss. Initially, relieve the pain andprevent infection by covering the wound with any clean dressing. Thisreduces pain and the chance for infection. Further, such protection enhancespatient mobility and the capability for performing other vital survivalfunctions. In burns about the face and neck, ensure the victim has an openairway. If necessary, perform a cricothyroidotomy before the patientdevelops extreme difficulties. Burns of the face and hands are particularlyserious as they interfere with the capability of survivors to meet their ownneeds. Soaking certain barks (willow, oak, or maple) in water leeches acidfrom the bark. Applying this solution soothes and protects burns through itsastringent action.65"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CAUTION: Do not apply greases or fats to burns.(2)Maintaining body fluids and salts is essential to recover fromburns. The only way to administer fluids in a survival situation is bymouth; hence, the casualty should ingest sufficient water early before nauseaand vomiting from toxicity intervenes. Consuming cooked animal eyes andblood helps restore electrolyte levels if salt tablets are not available.NOTE: The survivor may also pack salt in personal survival kitsto replace electrolytes (1/4 teaspoon per quart of water).10.WOUNDSa.Lacerations. Lacerations (cuts) are best left open because of theprobability of infection. Clean thoroughly, remove foreign material, andapply a protective dressing. Frequently, immobilization hastens the healingof major lacerations. On occasion (tactical), it may be necessary to close(cover) the wound, despite the danger of infection, in order to controlbleeding or increase the mobility of the patient. If a needle is available,the wound may be closed by suturing. Thread may be procured from fabric,clothing, or parachute lines. If suturing is required, place individualstitches far enough apart to permit drainage of the underlying parts. Do notworry about the cosmetic effect; just approximate the tissue. For scalpwounds, you may use hair to close the wound after the wound is cleansed.Infection is less a danger in the scalp area because of the rich blood supply.b.Abdominal Wounds. In the survival situation, abdominal wounds areparticularly serious. Without immediate and adequate surgery, patients withthese wounds have an extremely high mortality rate and their seriousnessrenders patients totally unable to care for themselves. Apply a securebandage to keep intestines from extruding through the wound. If theintestine is extruded, do NOT replace it because it is almost certain thatthe results will be fatal. Cover the extruded bowel with a large dressing,and keep the dressing wet with urine or any fluid that is fit to drink. Thepatient should lie on his back and avoid any motion that increases intra-abdominal pressure which might extrude more bowel. Keep the survivorimmobile or move him on a litter. Nature eventually takes care of theproblem either through death or by walling-off the damaged area.c.Sucking Chest Wounds. These wounds are easily recognized by thesucking noise and the appearance of foam or bubbles in the wound. Thesewounds must be closed immediately before serious respiratory and circulatorycomplications occur. Ideally, the patient should attempt to exhale whileholding the mouth and nose closed (Valsalva maneuver) as the wound is closed.This deflates the lungs and reduces the air trapped in the pleural cavity.Frequently, a taped, airtight dressing is all that is needed, but sometimesit is necessary to put in a stitch or two to make sure the wound is closed.66"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"11.GENERAL TREATMENTa.Infection. Infection is a serious threat to the survivor. Theinevitable delay in definite medical treatment and the reality of thesurvival situation increase the chances of wound infection. Antibiotics maynot be available in sufficient amounts. In survival medicine, you must placemore emphasis on prevention and control of infection by applying thetechniques used before the advent of antibiotics.(1)Unfortunately, survivors have little control over the amount andtype of infection introduced at the time of injury. However, they can helpcontrol infection by wearing clean clothes. Use care to prevent additionalinfection into wounds. Remove clothing from wounds to avoid contaminatingsurrounding skin areas. Do NOT touch wounds, regardless of type or severity,with dirty hands or objects. One exception to this rule is the essentialcontrol of arterial bleeding.(2)Promptly cleanse all wounds. Water is the most universallyavailable cleaning agent and should be (preferably) sterile. At sea level,sterilize water by placing it in a covered container and boiling it for tenminutes. Above 3,000 feet, boil water one hour (in a covered container) toensure adequate sterilization. Water remains sterile and can be storedindefinitely as long as it is covered.(a)Irrigate wounds rather than scrubbing them to minimizeadditional tissue damage. Wash foreign material from the wound to removesources of continued infection. Wash the skin adjacent to wounds thoroughlybefore bandaging. When water is not available for cleaning wounds, considerusing urine. Urine may well be the most nearly sterile of all fluidsavailable and, in some cultures, is preferred for cleaning wounds. Use urinefrom the midstream flow.(b)While soap is not essential to clean wounds, a bar ofmedicated soap placed in a personal survival kit and used routinely does muchto prevent the infection of seemingly inconsequential injuries. Externalantiseptics are best used for cleaning scratches, abrasions, and the skinareas adjacent to lacerations. Used in deep, larger wounds, antisepticsproduce further tissue damage.(c)Nature also provides antiseptics that can be used for woundcare. The American mountain ash, found from Newfoundland south to NorthCarolina, and its inner bark have antiseptic properties; the red berries,containing ascorbic acid, have been eaten to cure scurvy. Sweet Gum bark isstill officially recognized as being an antiseptic agent. Water from boiledSweet Gum leaves is also used as an antiseptic for wounds.b.Body Defenses. The human body has a tremendous capacity forcombating infections if it is permitted to do so. Applying heat to aninfected wound further aids in mobilizing local body defense measures.Lukewarm salt water soaks help draw out infection and promote oozing of67"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"fluids from the wound, thereby removing toxic products. Poultices of cleanclay, shredded bark of most trees, and ground grass seed do the same thing.In addition to the importance of proper rest and nutrition in wound healingand infection control, you should improve the logistics of the injured part.Immobilize the injury in a position to favor adequate circulation to and fromthe wound. Avoid constrictive clothing or bandages. Despite allprecautions, some degree of infection is almost universal in survival wounds.This is the primary reason for the open treatment advocated below.c.The Open-Treatment Method. This method is the only safe way tomanage survival wounds. No effort should be made to close open wounds bysuturing or by other procedures. In fact, it may be necessary to open thewound even more to avoid entrapment or infection and to promote drainage.The term \"open\" does not mean that dressings should not be used. Goodsurgery requires that although wounds are not \"closed,\" nerves, bone, andblood vessels should be covered with tissue. Such judgment may be beyond thecapability of the aircrew member, but protecting vital structures aids inrecovery and ultimate function. A notable exception to open treatment is theearly closure of facial wounds which interfere with breathing, eating, ordrinking. Wounds, left open, heal by forming infection resistant granulationtissue (proud flesh). This tissue is easily recognized by its moist redgranular appearance-a good sign in any wound.d.Antibiotics. Take antibiotics, when available, to control infection.Consensus is that the drug should be a \"broad spectrum\" drug; that is, itshould be effective against any microorganism rather than specific for justone or two types. The exact amount included in survival kits varies with thedrug and the basic number and types of infections to be expected. Rememberthat antibiotics are potency-dated items (shelf-life about four years).Including them in survival kits requires inspecting the kit and replacing thedrugs with active medical stocks.e.Debridement. Debridement is the surgical removal of lacerated,devitalized, or contaminated tissue. Severe wounds may need debriding tominimize infection (particularly of the gas-gangrene type) and to reduce(lower) septic (toxic) shock. In essense, debridement is the removal offoreign material and dead or dying tissue. The procedure requires skill andshould only be done by nonmedical personnel in cases of dire emergency. Ifrequired, cut dead skin away. Trim the muscle back to a point where bleedingstarts and gross discoloration ceases. Damaged fat tends to die and shouldbe cut away. Conserve bone and nerves where possible, and protect them fromfurther damage. Provide ample natural drainage for the potentially infectedwound and delay final closure.f.Drainage. Adequate natural drainage of infected areas promoteshealing. Generally, wicks or drains are unnecessary. On occasion, however,it may be better to remove an accumulation of pus (abscess) and insert light,loose packing to ensure continuous drainage. Sterilize the knife or otherinstrument used in making the incision for drainage to68"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"avoid introducing other types of organisms. The best way to sterilize in thefield is with dry or moist heat.g.Dressings and Bandages. After cleansing, cover all wounds with aclean dressing. The dressing should be sterile; however, in the survivalsituation, any clean cloth helps protect the wound from further infection. Aproper bandage anchors the dressing to the wound and affords furtherprotection. Bandages should be snug enough to prevent slippage, yet notconstrictive. Slight pressure reduces discomfort in most wounds and helpsstop bleeding. Once in place, do NOT change dressings too frequently unlessrequired; external soiling does not lessen the effectiveness of a dressing.Pain and some tissue damage accompanies any removal, and changing dressingsincreases the danger of infection.h.Maggot Therapy. During World War I, maggots were an acceptedtreatment for infected wounds. They ate infected and dead tissue from thosewounds. Before you decide to use maggots, however, remember that you mustexpose the wound to flies to introduce maggots. Because of their filthyhabits, flies are likely to introduce other bacteria into the wound, possiblycausing more complications. Also, maggots invade live, healthy tissue whenthe dead tissue is gone or not readily available. Despite its hazards,however, consider using maggot therapy (Figure 39) when you do not haveantibiotics and the wound does not heal, has become severely infected, andordinary debridement is impossible.12.ILLNESSESMany illnesses that are minor in a normal medical environment becomemajor in a survival situation when the individual is alone withoutmedications or medical care. Use standard methods (treat symptoms) toprevent expected diseases since treatment in a survival situation is sodifficult. Key preventive methods are to exercise, maintain a proper diet,and maintain a current immunization record.a.Food Poisoning.(1)Food poisoning is a significant threat to survivors. Due tosporadic food availability, excess foods must be preserved and saved forfuture consumption. Methods for preservation vary with the global area andsituation. Bacterial contamination of food sources has historically causedmore difficulty in survival situations than ingesting so-called poisonousplants and animals. Similarly, dysentary or water-borne diseases can becontrolled with proper sanitation and personal hygiene.(2)If the food poison is due to preformed toxin (staphylococcus orbotulism), supportive treatment is best. Acute symptoms occur (nausea,vomiting, and diarrhea) soon after ingesting contaminated food. Keep thepatient quiet and lying down, and ensure the patient drinks substantialquantities of water. If the poisoning is due to ingesting bacteria whichgrow within the body (delayed gradual onset of same symptoms), takeantibiotics (if available). In both cases, symptoms may be alleviated by 69"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"frequently eating small amounts of fine, clean charcoal.

Boils, heat rash, and fungal infections rarelydevelop into serious health problems. However, they cause discomfort andshould be treated.(1)Boils. Apply warn compresses to bring the boil to a head. Thenopen the boil using a sterile knife, wire, needle, or similar item.Thoroughly clean out the pus using soap and water. Cover the boil site andcheck it periodically to ensure no further infection develops.(2)Heat rash. Keep the area clean and dry. Apply powder ifavailable. A cold compress may help relieve itching.(3)Fungal infections. Keep the skin clean and dry, and expose theinfected area to as such sunlight as possible. Do not scratch or use strongsubstances such as iodine and alcohol. You cannot “burn out” fungus.70"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"c.Intestinal Parasites. You can usually avoid infestation of worms andother intestinal parasites if you take preventive measures. For instance,never go barefooted. The most effective way to avoid intestinal parasites isto not eat uncooked meat or raw vegetables that may possibly be contaminatedwith raw sewage or human feces used as fertilizer (night soil). However, ifyou should become infested and lack proper medicine, you might try one of thehome remedies in figure 40. Keep in mind, though, that these home remediesare not without danger. Most of them work on the principle of changing theenvironment of the gastrointestinal tract.Figure 40. Intestinal parasite home remedies.d.Diarrhea. This is a common, debilitating ailment caused by suchthings as a change in water and food, drinking contaminated water, eatingspoiled food, becoming fatigued, and using dirty dishes. You can avoid mostof these causes by practicing preventive medicine. If you get diarrhea,however, and do not have antidiarrheal medicine with you, you may find one ofthe following treatments is effective:(1)Limit your intake to fluids for 24 hours.(2)Drink 1 cup of strong tea every two hours until the diarrheaslows or stops. The tannic acid in the tea helps control diarrhea. Tannicacid is also found in the moist inner bark of hardwood trees. Boil the innerbark for two hours or more to release the tannic acid. Although thissolution has a vile taste and smell, it stops most cases of diarrhea.(3)Make a solution of treated water and one handful of groundchalk, charcoal, or dried bones.

Applyingthe simple guidelines in Figure 41 enables the survivor to safeguard personalhealth and that of others.14.HERBAL MEDICINEOur modern-day wonder drugs and fine laboratories and equipment haveobscured the old-time \"country doctor' medicine--determination, common sense,and a few primitive treatments. In many areas of the world, however, peoplestill depend on the local witch doctor or healer to cure their ailments.Many of the herbs (plants) and treatments they use are as effective as themost modern medications available. In fact, many modern medications comefrom refined herbs. For example, the white, stringy part of the rinds ofcitrus fruits and the apple pulp (apple pomace) left after pressing out thejuice contain pectin. However, you should use herbal medicine with extremecaution and only when you lack or have limited medical supplies. Some herbalmedicines are dangerous and may cause further damage or even death. Smalldoses of valerian root, for example, are effective in treating headaches andinsomnia. In doses exceeding 1/2 teaspoon per day, valerian can aggravatethe headache condition and cause delusions.72"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Figure 41.
