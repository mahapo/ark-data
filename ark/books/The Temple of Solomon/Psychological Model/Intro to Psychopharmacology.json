Since that time the effective treatment of schizophrenicpsychoses, depressions, anxiety syndromes and other mental disorders hasbecome possible and a new, multidisciplinary science – biological psychiatry –has developed. Clinical psychiatry has changed dramatically in the past 50years: fewer patients are hospitalized long term, psychiatric care and treatmenthave largely shifted to outpatient departments and private practices, and newmodels of combined pharmacological and non-drug-based prophylactic andtherapeutic interventions have been developed.When the first edition of this book was published, more than 20 years ago,the first wave of modern psychopharmacology – triggered by the partlyaccidental discovery of neuroleptic, antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs – wasessentially over. What some consider a second wave – the period characterizedby the advent of so-called atypical antipsychotic and more specifically actingantidepressant drugs – had not yet begun; use of drugs other thanbenzodiazepines in anxiety disorders was unusual, mood stabilizers otherthan lithium were not generally recognized and pharmacological treatment ofAlzheimer’s disease was probably not even thought of. Nevertheless, much ofthe basic knowledge necessary for these more recent developments was alreadyavailable at that time, and many of the clinical research concepts andinstruments were identical or very similar to those used today.This fourth edition ofPsychopharmacology: an Introductioncontains someimportant changes from the previous ones. Most importantly, several chapterswere either thoroughly revised or completely rewritten by very competentprofessional colleagues. This shared authorship is a direct consequence of theenormous growth of psychopharmacology that has occurred in the past fewdecades and the impossibility for a single person to oversee more than a fewareas of this multidisciplinary science. Readers of our book should know that,with one exception, all contributors and the main author are working in thepharmaceutical industry, all for the same drug company (Novartis Pharma)."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Although this could be seen as a serious source of scientific bias, all of us havemade an honest effort to minimize bias, to write as scientists withoutattempting to support, openly or covertly, the drugs marketed by ourcompany. Nevertheless, it was perhaps inevitable that some of the examplesand studies discussed in the text originated from our own preclinical andclinical work, and that we tend to see many issues typical of our science from arather specific standpoint.My thanks for help go to Drs Paul Glue and Keith Wesnes, who were kindenough to review and comment on parts of the manuscript and to suggestadditional references.

The English version of this book was firstpublished by John Wiley & Sons in 1983, who also brought out the secondedition in 1989 and have now produced this third English edition.This third edition essentially retains the structure of the second edition butits contents have been revised, with considerable changes in some parts. Thus,account is taken of the fact that a new generation of antidepressants has beenavailable for some years, that concepts of the mechanisms of neuroleptic actionhave altered several times and have led to products with new mechanisms ofaction, and that therapeutic advances have even been recorded in a field thatwas only recently considered to be hopeless, namely Alzheimer’s disease. Newmethodological developments, especially in the use of imaging techniques inpsychiatry, and changes in opinions on the best possible use of psychophar-maceuticals and their duration of use in schizophrenia and depression havebeen suitably taken into account.This book is aimed at doctors, psychologists and members of otherprofessions dealing with patients and clients receiving short-term or continuoustreatment with psychopharmaceuticals. It presents the desired actions andadverse effects of modern psychopharmaceuticals, their therapeutic uses andlimitations, the history of psychopharmacology and research into potentialnew psychopharmaceuticals. The emphasis lies on the clinical and psycholo-gical aspects of psychopharmacology and psychopharmacotherapy, with only abasic consideration of the neurophysiological, molecular biological andneuroendocrinological aspects.As in the previous editions, it was my aim to write a compact, interesting andeasily readable book, and to avoid specialist jargon and technical details as faras possible, but without losing sight of my own interests.

First, it comes after nearly a decade of exceptional growth inknowledge in the areas covered by this book: the drugs which are used to treatthe major mental illnesses, the mechanism of action of these drugs, the methodsused to identify and develop novel compounds, their effects in normals, andsocietal attitudes about cost-effectiveness of these agents, which stronglyinfluences the extent of utilization of new drugs, which are now much morecostly relative to other areas of the economy than previously. Many drugsbarely discussed in the previous edition are now standard treatments in manyparts of the world, e.g. the atypical antipsychotic drugs, mood stabilizers, andcholinesterase inhibitors, receive deserved detailed attention in the FourthEdition.Because the progress in multiple areas covered by this classic text has been soprofound in recent years, Rene ́Spiegel, a psychologist and psychopharmacol-ogist who had written nearly all of the three preceding editions himself,recruited a number of experts in specific fields of knowledge to assist in thisnew edition. Though most of these co-authors are from the pharmaceuticalindustry, I could detect no bias that this introduced into the presentation of thematerial that relates to their particular employers or the perspective that adisinterested academic might bring to the topic, with the welcome exceptionthat a considerable amount of attention is given to information that concernsdrug discovery and development. These are important topics which driveprogress in the field and are, in fact, almost the exclusive provence of industry,as academic and government groups have delegated this function to the privatesector.However, topics such as mechanism of action and clinical applications ofpsychotropic drugs are given the most detailed coverage. The organization ofthe Third Edition has been largely retained because of its effectiveness, but withaddition of two new chapters, one on Psychopharmacology and HealthEconomics, the other on the use of neuroimaging techniques, and broadening"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"of the focus of the chapter on Psychopharmacology and Memory to otherdomains of cognition. The advantages of a single authored text have beenpreserved despite the expanded scope and number of authors, due, no doubt,to good communication among the various authors and skillful final editing.The final product is an exceptionally readable and informative volume whichshould meet the varied needs of readers at many levels of sophistication. Whilefulfilling the promise of the title as an Introduction to Psychopharmacology,one of the outstanding features of this book is the depth of information itprovides in a number of key areas, particularly those that are clinically relevant.This book will be of particular value to the broad range of clinicians whonow have the privilege and responsibility to prescribe psychotropic drugs toclients and patients.Chapter 1, Modern Psychopharmaceuticals, written by Dr Hossein Fatemi,andChapter 8, Psychopharmaceuticals and the Treatment of MentalDisorders, provide succinct, up to date, and well-referenced information onhow to use the major classes of psychotropic drugs. The latter chapter discussesin a frank and balanced manner the ambivalence towards the use ofpharmacologic agents in mental disorders felt by some, and the limitationson the achievements of current drugs as ideal therapies for schizophrenia,bipolar disorder and major depression in particular. Clearly, much has beenaccomplished, but many needs, especially for prevention of relapse, removal ofspecific types of symptoms, and restoraton of work and social function, remainto be accomplished by drug and psychosocial therapies.Chapter 2, the History of Psychopharmacology,provides one of the bestshort essays on this fascinating topic to be found anywhere. Althoughpsychopharmaceuticals in today’s sense have been available only for about 50years, doctors, priests, medicine men, herbalists and others – witches! – haveat all times owned knowledge of various ingredients, mainly from plants, forthe relief or cure of mental suffering. Time and again the history of psychiatryshows swings between ‘soft’ methods of treatment (soothing, protecting,relieving, understanding the patient) and dramatically violent procedures(discipline, drill, intimidation, punishment) which, surprisingly, reached theirhigh point in the Europe of the so-called Enlightenment. Many will also findthe description of the prescribing habits of Emil Kraepelin and Eugen Bleuler,the historically most important figures in the history of schizophrenia, of greatinterest.Chapter 3, Effect of Psychotropic Medications on Healthy Subjects, is rarelydealt with in texts of psychopharmacology, and is superbly treated here. As theuse of psychotropic drugs spreads beyond the major diagnostic categories forwhich they were developed and approved, understanding the effects ofpsychotropic drugs on those with normal physiology has become of greaterimportance. Novel methods are required to assess these effects and thetechniques of current interest are well described here. The study of the effects ofxxPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"these agents in normals has yielded considerable information that clarifies theirmechanism of action in clinical conditions.Chapter 4, Mechanisms and Action in Man and Animals, written byDr Conrad Gentsch, provides a concise introduction to neurobiology at thecellular through systems level which facilitates understanding the range oftheories about the mechanism of action of the current generation ofpsychotropic drugs. Where there is no consensus about mechanism of action,the most widely held views are described. The chapter is very readable and willenable beginning students to understand the major theories of mechanism ofaction of psychotropic drugs. It is particularly strong in the description ofbehavioral animal models that are used for discovery and preclinicalcharacterization of potential new psychopharmaceuticals.Chapter 5, Clinical Research in Psychopharmacology, written by Dr FerencMartenyi, offers a good description of how drugs are developed in man. It iswritten from the perspective of someone in the pharmaceutical industry whohas first-hand knowledge of the myriad issues that lead to the enormousattrition in compounds that appear to have merit from test tube and animalstudies, and then fail somewhere along the way to meet the rigid criteria forefficacy and safety, as well as tolerability, that are required of a successfuladdition to the list of approved drugs. Pharmacokinetics and clinical trialdesign, including the most important rating instruments for assessment ofefficacy are discussed in considerable detail.Chapter 6, Neuroimaging Studies in Psychopharmacology, by Dr MarkSchmidt, describes studies with modern techniques that allow direct ‘‘on-line’’ observations of biological processes occurring in intact and fullyfunctional animals and human brains, and how these processes are alteredby centrally acting drugs. The chapter covers the most important aspects oftechniques known as SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computer Tomo-graphy), PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and fMRI (functionalMagnetic Resonance Imaging), and it describes the types of scientificquestions pursued with these methods as well as some limitations of thedifferent approaches.Chapter 7, Psychotropic Drugs and Cognitive Function, covers an area ofpsychopharmacology that has attracted much interest in recent years: theimpact of psychopharmaceuticals on human cognitive functioning. Separatesections describe cognitive deficiencies often or regularly observed in patientswith schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety syndromes etc., andhow these deficits are affected by antipsychotic, antidepressant, moodstabilizing, and anxiolytic etc. drugs.

Apart from psychopharmaceuticals, there are manyother substances with psychotropic action, such as alcohol, nicotine, cocaineand heroin, which are characterized as social or addictive products and have nogenerally recognized therapeutic applications in Western medicine. Analgesicsand members of other drug classes also have direct or indirect actions onsubjective state and behavior but are not considered to be psycho-pharmaceuticals because they are not used primarily for their psychotropiceffects.Like other medications also, psychopharmaceuticals can be classifiedaccording to various principles: the chemist characterizes them by theirchemical structure, the pharmacologist by their actions in representativebiological test systems and the doctor by their therapeutic uses or indications.The classification according toclinical criteriatoday covers the followingclasses of psychopharmaceuticals:.Antipsychotics for the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia and statesof agitation occurring in other psychiatric syndromes; these medicines arealso occasionally called neuroleptics or major tranquillizers.Psychopharmacology, Fourth Edition.

The sleep-inducing agents(hypnotics) most used today are chemically and pharmacologically closelyrelated to tranquillizers..Psychostimulants are medications that can increase drive and performance.Their most frequent use is in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD) and in narcolepsy. They are also called stimulants or, lesscommonly today, analeptics..Nootropics are substances that, especially in the elderly, may have abeneficial effect on cognitive functions without inducing general stimulation.They are being superseded by a new class of compound, the so-calledantidementia drugs.Apart from psychopharmaceuticals, there are many other substances thatalso affect subjective state and behavior: ‘social drugs’ such as alcohol andcaffeine have little or no therapeutic applications in Western medicine butundoubtedly affect subjective state and behavior, whereas the use of ‘drugs’such as marijuana, LSD, cocaine and heroin involves risks that, according totoday’s opinion, outweigh the possible benefits.2PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 1.1Classification of psychotropic substancesPosition of recognizedpsychotropic effectMedications havinga therapeutic actionSubstances having norecognized therapeuticactionPsychotropic effectPsychopharmaceuticals‘Social drugs’, ‘drugs’is the main effect, withAntipsychoticsAlcoholthe desired actionAntidepressantsNicotineMood stabilizersCocaine, heroin, etc.Anxiolytics, hypnoticsPsychostimulantsNootropics, antidementiadrugsPsychotropic effectAnalgesicsis a side effect, withNarcoticsundesired actionAntihistaminesAntihypertensivesAppetite suppressants"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Other medications, which will not be discussed in the following chapters,have psychotropic actions that are considered to be side effects or adverseeffects. Thus, some antihistamines (i.e. products used to counteract allergicreactions) induce fatigue and drowsiness, and the same applies to somemyorelaxants. Older antihypertensives (i.e. agents reducing blood pressure)such as alpha-methyldopa (Aldomet1) or clonidine (Catapres1) can causefatigue and depression.Many medications have indirect psychotropic effects in that they relieve painand other complaints and so improve well-being. Analgesics, antipyretics andanti-inflammatory products are the best-known examples. They are notconsidered to be psychotropic substances because they have no direct action onbehavior and subjective state when given in therapeutic doses.The following sections of this chapter concentrate on psychopharmaceuticalsin the sense of Table 1.1, i.e. antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers,anxiolytics and psychostimulants; attention also will be paid to hypnotics andantidementia drugs.1.2 ANTIPSYCHOTICS1.2.1 CLINICAL ACTIONS AND USESAntipsychotics are calming medications used to counteract marked innerunrest, psychomotor agitation and severe insomnia. These states can arisewithin the following contexts:.Schizophrenic psychoses, especially catatonic and paranoid forms (ICDF20.0 and F20.2, also F20.9, 23.1, 23.2, etc.)..Mania (ICD F30.1–30.9, F31.1 and 31.2)..Psychotic syndromes as sequelae of organic brain disorders (e.g. old ageparanoia, ICD F22.0)..Depressions, especially those with anxious, agitated symptoms (ICD F23.2and F33.3).Patients treated with antipsychotics find that these drugs have a pronouncedcalming effect that differs from that of other sedative medications (anxiolyticsand hypnotics) in two major respects. Firstly, in contrast to most anxiolytics,most antipsychotics are not myorelaxant and, unlike sleep inducers, are notnarcotic even in high doses. Secondly, apart from their calming action they alsoact on some psychotic symptoms (hence the expression ‘antipsychotics’). Theantipsychotic effects of these drugs generally develop only after several days orweeks of treatment. Delusions and ideas of persecution recede and partially orentirely lose their frightening character, and threatening and demanding voicesbecome quieter or are totally silenced. The patient gives the impression of beingMODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS3"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"able to cope with his surroundings in a more meaningful and comprehensiblemanner; his subjective state and behavior are less ‘psychotic’.The therapeutic effect of antipsychotics consists of a ‘‘calming action onpsychomotor agitation, aggressive behaviour, affective tensions, psychoticillusions, psychotic delusions, catatonic behavioural disturbances, and schizo-phrenic ego-disturbances’’ (Benkert and Hippius, 1980, p. 86). This descriptivelist also expresses the fact that neuroleptics have a primarily sedative action atthe start of a treatment. Delay and Deniker (1953), the discoverers of the firstantipsychotic, chlorpromazine (see Chapter 2), described the gradual waning ofthe general calming effect and the appearance of the antipsychotic actionduring therapy as follows: ‘‘Following a transient, somnolent phase, thepatients seem calm, indifferent and distant (in French ‘lointains’), their bearingis affectively and emotionally neutral and passive, although the intellectualfaculties do not appear to be impaired’’ (Delay and Deniker, 1953, p. 350).On the basis of studies with healthy subjects and observations in psychoticpatients, Degkwitz (1967, p. 108) distinguished between three phases of actionof antipsychotic drugs:.First phase (duration about one week): the patient tends to doze and sleep,even during daytime, and his drive is clearly reduced; he has no initiativeand appears lethargic and indifferent to his environment; there is a certaindetachment from worries and anxieties, also from those psychotic in nature,i.e. delusions, ideas of reference and paranoid–hallucinatory experiencesbecome less frequent..Second phase (duration about one week): the sedative effect recedes whilethe ‘antipsychotic’ effect is retained; during this phase, despite a pronouncedreduction in emotional tension, there is still a danger of unexpectedemotional outbreaks and over-reactions..Third phase: the general loss of drive is only minor whereas emotionalresponsiveness is still reduced; the patient seems to be indifferent and showslittle spontaneity; the antipsychotic drug effect is retained and, in manycases, the patient’s insight into his illness (and hence also the possibility forpsycho- and sociotherapeutic measures) increases.Some 20 years later, Kecket al.(1989) noted that the course of action ofneuroleptics, particularly the onset of their specific antipsychotic action, hasstill not been studied accurately enough. According to these authors there havebeen hardly any controlled studies in which clear distinction was made betweenthe non-specific calming action and the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptics.1.2.2 THE BEST-KNOWN PRODUCTSMore than 30 antipsychotics are currently marketed in many Europeancountries (and a few less in the USA and other English-speaking areas), the4PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"best known of which are presented in Table 1.2.

Thus, elderly patients are given the smallest possibledoses, whereas large doses may be required in young, acutely psychoticpatients.1.2.3 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIFFERENT PRODUCTSIn view of the extent of Table 1.2 and the aforementioned number of 30 ormore commercially available compounds, the obvious question is whether somany antipsychotics are actually needed or in what ways the various productsdiffer in clinical use.Two different aspects have to be considered in the answer: economic andscientific. An economic interest to have a variety of products in the marketexists on the part of those pharmaceutical companies that have developed andmarketed or are developing antipsychotics. Consequently, their advertisingplaces the emphasis on the special features and advantages of individualmedications, even though the differences between many products are notalways very relevant clinically. Nevertheless, the differences that actually existbetween products with regard to their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamicproperties are of scientific interest, especially those related to the effects ofatypical versus typical antipsychotics:.Pharmacokinetics(i.e. study of the movements of a medication): anti-psychotics and other medications show differences in absorption, distribu-tion, metabolism and excretion as a result of their different chemicalstructures and pharmaceutical preparations (capsule, tablet, injectable) andin relation to the conditions within the body (see Chapter 5). The transfer ofa medication from the blood into the brain tissue across the so-called blood–brain barrier, its binding to specific brain structures and thus its actionsdepend on the physicochemical properties of the molecule. The interplay ofthese and other factors explains why antipsychotics of different chemicalstructures are not equally effective milligram for milligram (Table 1.2:column 3) and why they differ with regard to onset and duration of action..Pharmacodynamics: antipsychotics also differ in their pharmacodynamics,i.e. their pharmacological and clinical profiles of action. A rough distinctionis made between highly sedative, hypnotic antipsychotics (e.g. clopenthixol,levomepromazine) and other products with weaker initial sedative action(e.g. fluphenazine and haloperidol). Sedative antipsychotics are prescribedfor states of major unrest, often combined with insomnia, whereas the lesssedative antipsychotics are preferred for patients suffering from delusionsand hallucinations but in whom heavy sedation during daytime isundesirable.The availability of the more recent, so-called atypical antipsychotics(clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone; see Table 1.2) makes it prudent6PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"that these agents be used as first-line therapeutic drugs in the treatment of allpatients who are deemed psychotic/schizophrenic. This is mostly due to thesafer profile of these medications versus the old typical antipsychotics (e.g.haloperidol). However, there are exceptional cases when, in emergencies and inthe case of disturbed and agitated patients representing a danger to themselvesand to others, the doctor may choose a medication having a pronouncedsedative and initially sleep-inducing effect. Despite the very varied supply, mostdoctors restrict themselves to using just a few antipsychotics with which theyhave become familiar during their training and clinical activities.1.2.4 SIDE EFFECTS (‘ADVERSE EFFECTS’) OFANTIPSYCHOTICSThe clinical choice of an antipsychotic is not only determined by the diagnosedillness and the prevailing symptoms but also on the basis of what side effectsthe treating doctor regards as being acceptable in each individual case.Antipsychotics are not only strong-acting with respect to their desired effectsbut also with respect to their undesirable actions, known as side effects. Table1.3 provides a summary of the commonest side effects of antipsychotics.In general, the sedating, initially sleep-promoting antipsychotics, especiallyin larger doses, often induce vegetative side effects such as orthostatichypotension, mostly accompanied by acceleration of pulse rate, modificationsof myocardial activity that are revealed in the electrocardiogram (ECG),sweating, dry mouth and sometimes impaired sexual function, especially inmen. In contrast, agents having a pronounced antipsychotic action often leadto extrapyramidal motor symptoms, namely dyskinesias (disturbed move-ments), iatrogenic (treatment-induced) Parkinsonian states and, afterprolonged use, tardive dyskinesias (see Section 1.2.5). The ‘atypical’ antipsychoticclozapine and, to a lesser extent, olanzapine and quetiapine are exceptions to thisrule because they exhibit marked antipsychotic activity associated with aspectrum of side effects more typical of a sedating, weakly antipsychotic agent.Irrespective of the type of action, antipsychotics may also trigger adversehormonal shifts (elevation of prolactin levels) and often, as a result, amenorrheaand (transient) sterility, breast enlargement (gynecomastia) and lactation.In view of the large number of potential adverse effects, the benefits and risksof antipsychotic treatment have to be weighed carefully against each other ineach individual patient: the unrestricted prescription of these medications isjust as unwarranted as total abstinence from medications.1.2.5 NEUROLEPTICS AND TARDIVE DYSKINESIAS:UNANSWERED QUESTIONSTardive dyskinesias are motor disturbances that sometimes arise followinglong-term treatment with neuroleptics. The first symptoms to appear areMODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS7"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"generally rolling and gyratory movements of the tongue. These are followed bysucking and smacking movements of the lips and, finally, the trunk andextremities may be affected. The dyskinesias disappear entirely during sleepand subside during wakefulness when the parts of the body involved are movedintentionally, e.g. during talking, eating or writing.Opinions vary as to the incidence and causes of tardive dyskinesias and theirprecise connection with the use of neuroleptics. Estimates of their incidenceextend from 0.5% to 56% of all chronically hospitalized psychiatric patients –a discrepancy that is attributed primarily to the differences in criteria governingthe selection of patients for various investigations and to heterogeneous8PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 1. 3Side effects of antipsychoticsVegetative disordersa(particularly with sedative–hypnotic antipsychotics).Decrease in blood pressure, especially on standing up (i.e. orthostatic hypotension).Acceleration of pulse rate.Modification of myocardial activity (ECG changes).Sweating, dry mouth, constipation.Impotence, ejaculation disorders, anorgasmiaExtrapyramidal motor disorders(particularly with antipsychotics having a pronouncedantipsychotic action)Early dyskinesia and dystonias(uncontrolled movements and postures that may arise atthe start of therapy).Spasms of the tongue, visual spasms, pharyngospasms.Grimacing, stiff neck, trismus.Gyratory and rotatory movements of the upper extremitiesParkinsonism.Restriction of motor movement (akinesia).Loss of facial expression (hypomimia), festinating gait.Increased muscle tension (rigor), trembling (tremor)Akathisia.Restlessness, inability to remain seated.Urge to move continuouslyTardive dyskinesia.Involuntary chewing, smacking of lips, swallowing and rolling movements of thetongue.Gyratory and flailing movements of the extremitiesaTheneuroleptic malignant syndrome(NMS; see Shalev and Munitz, 1986), a rare but veryhazardous complication of neuroleptic treatment, is counted among the vegetative disorders butmay occur also after the use of neuroleptics with pronounced antipsychotic action. This syndromeis characterized by immobility, rigidity, tremor, greatly elevated body temperature (i.e.hyperthermia), accelerated pulse, bouts of sweating and white blood count shifts. Figures for theincidence of NMS vary from 0.4% to 1.4% of all patients treated with neuroleptics (Popeet al.,1986); young men are affected relatively more frequently (Kellam, 1990)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"assessment criteria (Kane and Smith, 1982; Meltzer and Fatemi, 2001). Tardivedyskinesias may arise during treatment with neuroleptics but are also observedmonths or years after the medication has been discontinued. Tardivedyskinesias are more commonly seen in older patients, although motordisturbances in varying forms are, in any event, more frequent in advanced age(Vargaet al., 1982). Moreover, older patients being treated with neurolepticsgenerally have a longer history of illness and drug therapy than do youngerpatients. Some authors take the view that the cumulative neuroleptic dose overa period of time (and not the duration of treatment) represents the decisive riskfactor for the appearance of tardive dyskinesias. However, this view has beencontradicted on the basis of empirical studies (Bergenet al., 1992).1.3 ANTIDEPRESSANTS1.3.1 CLINICAL ACTIONS AND USESAntidepressants are medications used to treat depression, i.e. states of severedejection lasting for weeks or months. The term ‘depression’ does not designatea single disease but a syndrome that needs to be characterized more preciselyon the basis of the prevailing symptoms present and taking the patient’s priorhistory into account. On the basis of the patient’s clinical status, differentiationis made between inhibited and agitated forms of depression; states ofdepression that are almost exclusively expressed in the form of physicalcomplaints and symptoms are also termed somatized or masked depressions.Antidepressants are primarily prescribed for their mood-elevating action,which develops after several days of treatment and often only after someweeks. The expressions ‘thymoleptic’ (i.e. mood-stabilizing medicament) and‘thymeretic’ (i.e. mood-activating medicament) designate two antidepressantgroups that differ partially in their pharmacological and clinical actions.Neither thymoleptics nor thymeretics act to improve mood or produceeuphoria in healthy, non-depressed subjects, so in this respect their mood-lightening effect can be considered disease-specific.A major indication for antidepressants is endogenous depression, which, bydefinition, has its origin neither in a physical cause nor in a psychologicallytraceable development or cause. In the case of so-called psychogenic depressionor depression mostly due to situational factors, on the other hand,antidepressants are of only secondary importance; in such cases therapyshould begin with psychotherapeutic procedures and then, if not responsive, beextended to medications.Combined pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic approaches are alsosuccessful in psychogenic depression (see Chapter 8). In the case ofsomatogenic depression, which by definition is based on a physical illness,MODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS9"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"causal therapy is, wherever possible, directed at the underlying physicalailment, antidepressants possibly being used to provide an additionalsymptomatic relief.Thymoleptics and thymeretics are not ‘happy pills’, nor are they euphorics.In the case of endogenous depression there is a balancing out of pathologicallow mood, an effect that is normally obtained in two to three weeks or evenlonger in many cases. The first effect to become apparent in most cases ofdepression is the calming one, with the result that anxiousness, unrest and sleepdisturbances can be reduced quickly and hence the patient’s confidence in thetreatment increases. Drugs that may be stimulating or cause euphoria inhealthy volunteers, such as amphetamine, alcohol or cocaine, are not suitablefor use as antidepressants.If an antidepressant is discontinued too early, rapid and serious relapsemay result. This indicates that, whereas antidepressants may shorten or curb adepressive episode, they cannot definitely end – and hence cure – it. Theattenuation of depressive symptoms is thus not a sufficient criterion forwithdrawing drug therapy (Chapter 8). The decision as to when anantidepressant may be discontinued is often difficult – and also dependent onthe chronicity of the patient’s depression and the number of episodes ofdepression experienced.1.3.2 THE BEST-KNOWN PRODUCTSThere are about 30 antidepressants marketed at present in most Europeancountries (fewer in the USA), differing in their pharmacokinetic andpharmacodynamic properties. The best-known products are listed in Table1.4. In clinical terms, distinction is made between initially-sedative, drive-neutral and activating antidepressants. Initially-sedative antidepressants, suchas amitriptyline and doxepine, are prescribed primarily for depressions withanxious–agitated symptoms and act initially to calm the patient and promotesleep; their mood-lightening effect develops later. Weakly sedative andactivating antidepressants (e.g. nortriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine) areprescribed when sedation of the patient is not indicated or is undesirable(Fig. 1.1). Products that have been introduced in the last 10 years are generallycharacterized by better tolerability and greater safety.1.3.3 HOW EFFECTIVE ARE ANTIDEPRESSANTS?It is not always easy to assess the success of antidepressant treatmentaccurately because depression often tends to spontaneous healing or remission.Cyclic and periodic forms of endogenous depression follow a phasic pattern:the depressive episode lasting weeks or months can, in the bipolar form, shiftinto mania or there is a gradual lightening of the depression, as may be10PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"observed in the unipolar forms. The depressions of middle and old age(involutional and late depressions) are also subject to spontaneous remission orhealing, even though the tendency to chronicity is intensified and the risk ofrecurrence of depression is greater (review by Jablensky, 1987). Psychogenicdepression often subsides when the exterior (social, familial) circumstances orinner (psychodynamic) conditions of the patient change, whereas somaticdepression is generally also relieved when the physical cause is eliminated.

Controlled trials, i.e. comparisons between an activeproduct such as an antidepressant and placebo (a medicament containing noactive ingredient), do not always produce the expected results (Table 1.5).According to an early review by Morris and Beck (1974), placebo wastherapeutically equal to the studied antidepressant in 31 of 88 publishedcomparative trials, i.e. in 35% of all studies. With these figures it also has to beconsidered that trials with a ‘negative’ outcome (i.e. no significant differencebetween active product and placebo) have a much smaller chance of being12PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 1.1Spectra of action of antidepressants.

A detailed list of general and specific common side effectsassociated with the newer generation of antidepressants is seen in Table 1.7.1.4 MOOD STABILIZERS1.4.1 CLINICAL ACTIONS AND USESMood stabilizers are a variable group of medications that stabilize the mood ina manic or hypomanic patient. This class of medications is mainly used foracute and maintenance treatment of patients who suffer from bipolar disorderor manic–depressive illness or those suffering from schizoaffective illness.Bipolar disorder is a debilitating mood disorder characterized by episodes ofmania or hypomania alternating with depression. The manic symptoms mayconsist of an expansive, elated or irritable mood, pressured speech, flight ofideas, decreased need for sleep, distractibility and excessive participation inactivities that have a potential for painful consequences (APA, 1994). Thesymptoms may last for one week and cause marked impairment in social andoccupational function or lead to hospitalization. In general, a manic phase maylead into either a euthymic or depressed period. Depressive periods areextremely severe and prompt the patient to seek psychiatric help. The suiciderate is quite high and is estimated at 10–25%.DSM-IV (APA, 1994) criteria recognize two types of bipolar disorder. In type Ibipolar disorder, a patient exhibits mania and depression. In type II disorder,mania is replaced by hypomania (a less severe form) and alternates with depression.Several course modifiers are recognized in the evaluation of subjects with bipolardisorder, e.g. mixed states, rapid cycling and dysphoric mania. A mixed manic stateis characterized by the simultaneous presence of both depressive and manicsymptoms. Dysphoric mania is characterized by complaints of depression, anxietyand anger while experiencing mania (Janicaket al., 2001). Rapid cyclingcharacterizes a group of treatment-resistant bipolar patients who experience aminimum of four episodes (hypomania, mania, depression, mixed mania) during aperiod of 1 year (Dunneret al., 1977; APA, 1994; Janicaket al., 2001).The treatment of bipolar disorder is contingent on correct diagnosis becauseinitiation of a mood-stabilizing agent may significantly alter the course ofMODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS15"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"disease. Classically, lithium has been the main agent, which not only treats themanic/hypomanic symptoms but also treats the depressive symptoms. Incontrast to the antidepressants described so far in this book, lithium is not acomplex synthetic compound but a metal found in nature in the form of anumber of salts. Lithium has a prophylactic action against manic anddepressive episodes occurring in the context of bipolar disorder. Under lithiummedication, the intervals between the individual episodes gradually becomelonger and the protection against relapse becomes all the more pronounced thelonger lithium is regularly taken (Baldessarini, 1985). Recently, a number ofother agents have been used in the treatment of bipolar disorder that may, incertain patients, be more effective or better tolerated. This issue is importantbecause not all patients respond to lithium, and from those who do respondwell to lithium a proportion cannot tolerate the varied side effects:.Valproic acid (Depakote1) is an anticonvulsant with good antimanic actionthat is especially suited for patients with rapid cycling and mixed episodes(Bowdenet al., 1994). However, it is a poor antidepressant, necessitating theuse of a low-dose SSRI in the treatment of depression that may occur in thecourse of bipolar disease..Lamotrigine, another anticonvulsant, has been shown to be a potentiallygood mood stabilizer with both antidepressant and antimanic efficacy(Fatemiet al., 1997; Calabreseet al., 1999)..Other agents with anticonvulsant properties that may be of use in thetreatment of bipolar disorder include topiramate, gabapentin, tiagabine andcarbamazepine (Janicaket al., 2001).The antiepileptic agent carbamazepine (Tegretol1) has been discussed formany years as an alternative to lithium because it also has an antimanic effectand prophylactic activity against depression, with possibly better tolerability.However, carbamazepine has not yet been proven to be superior to lithium,16PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 1.8A selection of well-known and potential mood stabilizers (Janicaket al.,2001, reprinted with permission)Trade nameGeneric nameCustomary oraldaily dose (mg)Depakote1, Depakene1Valproic acida250–1500Eskalith1, Lithonate1, Lithobid1Lithiuma300–1800Lamictal1Lamotrigine12.5–200Neurontin1Gabapentin600–3600Tegretol1Carbamazepine200–1200Topamax1Topiramate300–600Zyprexa1Olanzapinea10–20aApproved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute mania."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"and its precise indications have not been adequately defined (Prien andGelenberg, 1989), so it is mostly reserved for those patients who do not toleratelithium or do not respond to it.Several other agents of different chemical classes have been found to be ofhelp in the acute treatment of bipolar disease, such as clozapine, olanzapineand nimodipine (Janicaket al., 2001) (Table 1.8).1.4.2 SIDE EFFECTS OF MOOD STABILIZERSBy far the most untoward side effects belong to lithium (Table 1.9). A fine tremoroften becomes apparent at the beginning of and during therapy. In addition,some patients complain of nausea, bloating and other gastrointestinal disorders.Thirst, polyuria (increased excretion of urine) and muscular weakness are notunusual and although disturbances of thyroid and possibly kidney function arenot common they call for regular check-ups for the patient receiving lithium.Weight gain is another side effect of lithium; about 20% of all long-term patientsgain 10 kg or more in weight. Because lithium has a narrow therapeutic range(i.e. the range between the therapeutically effective and the toxic dose), theconcentration in the patient’s blood has to be monitored regularly.1.5 ANXIOLYTICS AND HYPNOTICS1.5.1 CLINICAL ACTIONS AND USESAnxiolytics are medications with a calming action that are used in states ofunrest, anxiety and tension of many types.

This multiple usage ispromoted by the fact that anxiolytics of the benzodiazepine type have analmost exclusively central action so that vegetative effects (dry mouth,sweating, visual disturbances, urine retention, constipation, fall in bloodpressure), which can be unpleasant for patients or even hazardous, arepractically absent.Many of thehypnoticsused today are also benzodiazepines or closely relatedto them. Hypnotics differ from anxiolytics mainly with regard to the timing oftheir action: they generally have a fast onset of action, but fading after a fewhours so that there is no hangover in the form of tiredness or lack of alertnesson the following morning. Compared with barbiturates, often used previouslyas sleeping pills, the modern hypnotics are characterized by greater safety;successful suicide attempts are rare with benzodiazepine derivatives and relateddrugs.1.5.2 THE BEST-KNOWN PRODUCTSSome 25 anxiolytics and hypnotics are marketed at present; the best known ofthese are listed in Table 1.10. Here, again, there are striking differences betweenthe doses of these products, which can be explained in the same way as forantipsychotics. The benzodiazepine derivatives and related compounds showfew qualitative differences; nevertheless, the time–effect features, i.e. the timingof onset of action and peak action as well as duration of action, mean that it issensible to use different products for different purposes.1.5.3 ANXIOLYTICS OR PSYCHOTHERAPY ?What are the accepted indications for anxiolytics? Generally speaking, thesemedications are given nowadays when a patient suffers from anxiety states orsymptoms to such an extent that his daily routine is considerably disrupted. Itis quite clear from this formulation that the indications for anxiolytics are lesssharply defined than those of the antipsychotics and antidepressants: when doanxiety symptoms impair daily routine to an extent that one can speak ofconsiderable disruption? And who is to determine whether a disruption isconsiderable or trivial: the patient, the doctor, the relatives?18PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Like almost all relevant authors, Lader and Petursson (1983) also adviseagainst the long-term use of anxiolytics and they emphasize that most anxietystates and phases of insomnia generally last for only a limited period of time;either the acute stress fades or the patient becomes used to the situation (orcopes with it successfully), or a spontaneous remission occurs. In many casesthe patient can be managed with advice and reassurance, and thus withoutmedicaments.Many patients with symptoms of anxiety and tension reject psychotherapyout of hand, often using extraneous and rather irrelevant grounds as a pretext.MODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS19Table 1.10A selection of well-known anxiolytics and hypnoticsTrade name (UK and US)Generic nameDose (mg) UseAdumbran1, Seresta1(UK),Serax1(US)Oxazepam20–150 Anxiolytic,sedativeAmbien1Zolpidem5/10InsomniaAtivan1Lorazepam2–10AnxiolyticBuspar1Buspirone15–30AnxiolyticCentrax1Prazepam20–60HypnoticDalmane1Flurazepam15–30HypnoticDoral1Quazepam7.5/15HypnoticEuhynos1, Normison1,Tenox1Temazepam10–60HypnoticFrisium1Clobazam20–60AnxiolyticHalcion1Triazolam0.25–1.0 HypnoticKlonopin1Clonazepam1–6Panic disorder,anticonvulsant,alcoholwithdrawal,social phobia,acute maniaLexotan1Bromazepam3–24AnxiolyticLibrium1(UK), Limbitrol1(US)Chlordiazepoxide5–150 AnxiolyticNitrados1, Somnite1(UK),Mogadon1(US)Nitrazepam5–15HypnoticNoctamid1Lormetazepam0.5–2.0 HypnoticPaxipam1Halazepam60–160 HypnoticProsom1Estazolam1/2HypnoticRestoril1Temazepam15–30HypnoticRohypnol1Flunitrazepam2–6HypnoticSonata1Zaleplon10InsomniaTranxene1ClorazepateDipotassium10–60AnxiolyticValium1Diazepam5–60AnxiolyticVersed1Midazolam5/50 i.v.

Muscle tension, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, sleepdisturbances and other symptoms are often the somatic equivalents of statesof psychic tension, and the worries and anxieties of patients are then directed atthe physical symptoms, with the result that the original cause recedes into thebackground and is emotionally relieved. It thus becomes clear why there arebroad and major fields of application for anxiolytics outside psychiatry, mainlyin internal medicine, rheumatology, gynecology and pediatrics. Anxiolytics areoften referred to as panaceas, i.e. a cure for everything and everyone – acriticism that is only partly justified in the opinion of many doctors: shouldcounseling or psychotherapeutic measures be ruled out in a patient forextraneous or pertinent inner reasons, then it would not be seen as ‘medicallyethical’ to refrain on reasons of principle from trying to treat the patient withan anxiolytic drug.1.5.4 SIDE EFFECTS OF ANXIOLYTICSThe generally excellent tolerability of these preparations has contributedgreatly to the widespread use of anxiolytics. The commonest side effects (Table1.11) are tiredness and muscle relaxation and these usually can be avoided orattenuated by reducing the dose. Ataxia and paradoxical reactions such asirritability and increased agitation occasionally arise in the elderly but are rarein younger patients. Much attention has been focused on the negative effects ofbenzodiazepines on memory and other cognitive functions (see Chapter 7).1.5.5 DEPENDENCY ON BENZODIAZEPINESWith their low toxicity, their action limited almost exclusively to the centralnervous system and their other practical advantages (few pharmacokineticinteractions with other medicaments), anxiolytics and hypnotics of thebenzodiazepine group apparently represent almost ideal medications. How-ever, it is precisely the good tolerability and lack of subjectively unpleasant sideeffects that can lead to problems: whereas hardly a single patient wants to takeantipsychotics or antidepressants without a clinical need, there is a great risk ofanxiolytic drug abuse. These medications have a relaxing and calming action,the world seems friendlier and more harmonious and real personal problemsbecome less pressing. On the other hand, unrest, anxiety and distress reappearquickly and are often intensified after withdrawal of these medications, so it isdifficult to give up anxiolytics once the use of them has become a habit.The problems of withdrawal of anxiolytics and hypnotics have beendescribed in innumerable publications (reviews by Owen and Tyrer, 1983;Griffiths and Sannerud, 1987). Scho ̈pf (1985) produced a compilation of the20PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"most common symptoms found after discontinuation of long-term benzodia-zepine medication. According to him, the following symptoms arise ‘frequentlyto regularly’: dysphoria (ill humor), anxiety, insomnia, muscle pain andtwitches, tremor, restlessness, nausea, loss of appetite and weight, headaches,sweating and blurred vision, i.e. to a large extent those symptoms againstwhich the benzodiazepines were prescribed in the first place.More striking are withdrawal phenomena having no connection with theoriginal symptoms, namely disturbances of perception and sense of reality.These include hypersensitivity to noise, light and other sensory stimuli, as wellas distorted perception in the visual, kinesthetic and acoustic spheres.Disturbances affecting the sense of reality include transient depersonalizationand derealization phenomena. Although these disturbances do not ariseregularly (but according to Scho ̈pf in about 50% of cases), they are unpleasantfor those affected, often causing anxiety and low spirits, especially as fewdoctors are aware of these symptoms and therefore cannot suitably preparetheir patients for withdrawal of anxiolytics.Many regimens intended to prevent the appearance of benzodiazepinedependency or to make the unavoidable withdrawal symptoms more tolerablehave been devised and published (Marks, 1988; Sartory and Maurer, 1991).Controlled trials have also been performed to compare abrupt and gradualwithdrawal regimens and to assess the appearance of withdrawal symptomsafter discontinuing benzodiazepines with long and short half-lives (Bustoet al.,1986; Rickelset al., 1990; Schweizeret al., 1990). The results of these trials canbe summarized as follows:(1) Withdrawal symptoms are common after the discontinuation ofbenzodiazepines following prolonged use, and arise both with abruptand gradual withdrawal and with products having short and long half-lives.MODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS21Table 1.11Side effects of anxiolytics (somewhat similar to the after-effects of benzo-diazepine hypnotics).Sedation: feeling of fatigue, drowsiness, inattention.Deterioration of performance: decreased concentration and decreased physicalcapacity; anterograde amnesia (see Chapter 7).Muscle relaxation, disturbed coordination, ataxia.States of disorientation: mostly in elderly patients.Paradoxical reactions: excitement, agitation, irritability, aggressiveness.Euphoria, withdrawal symptoms, risk of dependency.So-called alcohol potentiation: the sedative action of tranquillizers is potentiated byalcohol. Relevant impairments are possible after a combined intake of tranquillizerdoses and amounts of alcohol that when taken alone would produce no detectableactions (Mattila, 1984)"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"(2) After abrupt discontinuation, the withdrawal symptoms described byScho ̈pf (1985) and others are particularly severe and frequent during thefirst few days but then fade; with gradual discontinuation, the withdrawalsymptoms are less frequent but show slower decrease with the passage oftime.(3) The subjectively perceived severity of withdrawal symptoms and thereadiness to withstand them without recourse to rescue medication varygreatly from one person to another.(4) The discontinuation of benzodiazepines with a short half-life is particularlydifficult and there is a great tendency to use rescue medication after bothabrupt and gradual withdrawal.Many authors (Allgulander 1986; Uhlenhuthet al., 1988; Chen and Lader,1990) have debated the question of whether the use of benzodiazepines formsan epidemic that should be countered by more specific legislation. On the basisof a representative survey in more than 3000 adult Americans, Mellingeret al.(1984) concluded that only a small percentage of the population (1.6%) can beconsidered ‘long-term consumers’ of these medicaments and that these patientsare characterized by the following features: greater age, more women, moremental symptoms and more health problems. Because most long-termconsumers were found to maintain regular contact with their doctor andtake their medicine as prescribed, Mellingeret al.saw no grounds for alarm orfor restrictive measures against benzodiazepines. However, this is a view notshared by all authors.1.5.6 ALTERNATIVES TO BENZODIAZEPINESIn principle, all drugs with damping action on the central nervous system couldbe used as anxiolytics or hypnotics, but the pharmacological and/orpharmacokinetic properties of most compounds are not appropriate for theirtherapeutic use:.As a substance known in almost all cultures, alcohol has only a non-specificsedating action, it quickly creates dependency and is quite toxic..Opiates and the other natural products discussed in Chapter 2 are toxic and/or quickly create dependency..Barbiturates create dependency, have an unsuitable therapeutic safetymargin and exhibit adverse interactions with other medicaments..Antihistamines, which penetrate into the central nervous system, have anon-specific sedative action, i.e. they can induce subjectively unpleasant sideeffects.Because there is a great demand for anxiolytic and hypnotic substances andbecause the use of benzodiazepines should, in the opinion of many, be restricted,22PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"there is still great interest in obtaining effective, safe and non-habituatinganxiolytics and hypnotics. The use of low doses of antipsychotics and (sedating)antidepressants has therefore been proposed in cases where a rapid onset ofdependency is to be feared with benzodiazepines or where these products arecontraindicated for other reasons, as in elderly patients at risk of stumbling andfalling. According to the information summarized by Mo ̈ller (1993), the clinicalresults with some low-dose neuroleptics used as anxiolytics are very good,although the potential tardive sequelae of this type of treatment are still poorlyknown. Positive results have also been obtained with the sedating antidepressanttrimipramine, which is used in low doses as a sleeping agent primarily in elderlypatients (Dietmaier and Laux, 1993), as well as with trazodone.The product buspirone represents another alternative, being an anxiolyticwith a novel mechanism of action and, unlike benzodiazepines, no anti-convulsant or myorelaxant activities. Although buspirone has anxiolyticactivity, it does not induce a spontaneous feeling of relaxation or of well-beingand, insofar as the available clinical experience available allows, has lesspotential to produce dependency than benzodiazepines. Buspirone also differsfrom benzodiazepines with regard to side effects: sedation, amnesia and ataxiapractically do not occur, but the substance can lead to nausea, diarrhea andoccasionally headache. The disadvantages of buspirone are its low bioavail-ability (less than 10%), which can make dosage difficult, and the fact that itsanxiolytic action develops only after several days of regular administration.Buspirone is therefore not indicated if rapid anxiolysis is required. On the otherhand, it is particularly suitable when therapy is expected to last for a long time.Finally, several new-generation antidepressants have been approved by healthauthorities in the treatment of anxiety disorders, e.g. paroxetine (for socialphobia, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder), fluvoxamine (forobsessive–compulsive disorder), venlafaxine (for generalized anxiety disorder),sertraline (for panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder) and fluoxetine (for obsessive–compulsive disorder).These drugs are suitable for longer-term treatment of anxiety disorders atsimilar doses as those used in depressive disorders.1.6 PSYCHOSTIMUL ANTS1.6.1 ACTIONS AND USES OF PSYCHOSTIMULANTSPsychostimulants are psychically stimulating pharmaceuticals; synonyms arepsychotonics, psychoanaleptics, psychic energizers. Using psychostimulants itis possible to prevent or suppress states of exhaustion and feelings of tirednessthat appear after great exertion, during long and monotonous activity andfollowing sleep deprivation. Alertness, concentration and enterprise areMODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS23"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"boosted through the use of psychostimulants and there may be pronouncedwell-being or even a state of euphoria, particularly after higher doses. Thefeeling of increased concentration and alertness is not merely subjective innature; greater performance and improved consistency of performance alsomay be established objectively.Despite these desirable effects, psychostimulants do not enjoy a goodreputation and are very restrictively prescribed nowadays. The main reason forthis is the potential for abuse of these medicaments in sport (doping) andamong drug addicts (intravenously administered amphetamine products,‘speed’, etc.). The uncontrolled use of stimulants in large doses can also leadto ‘amphetamine psychoses’, i.e. states of intense unrest and anxiety associatedwith delusions and (generally visual) hallucinations. Because of these risks,psychostimulants of the amphetamine type are available strictly on pre-scription only in almost all countries. Another drawback of knownpsychostimulants is tachyphylaxis: when used repeatedly, the products quicklylose their effect, so that long-term users are forced to increase the dose and,depending on the duration of use and dose, will go through a very unpleasantwithdrawal syndrome in the form of insuperable drowsiness, lethargy or evendepression if they want to stop the product temporarily or definitely.Psychostimulants are used therapeutically in children and adolescentssuffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and innarcolepsy. Patients with ADHD are characterized by particular inattentive-ness, motor unrest, learning disorders, impulsivity and affect incontinence. Theprevalence of ADHD is reported as 3–5% of all school-age children (in theUSA); depending on the author, the syndrome is two to nine times morecommon in boys than in girls (Biedermann, 1991). Interestingly, stimulants donot cause a further increase in unrest in these children and adolescents but leadto improved attentiveness, longer times spent on the same activity, increasedself-control and thus improved adjustment to school and home life (Chapter 7).This seemingly paradoxical effect of stimulants is explained by their action inregulating or stabilizing vigilance, and the success rates amount to about 70%of all treated children (Wilens and Biedermann, 1992). In patients with ADHD,psychostimulants do not lose their efficacy even after prolonged use. Use ofstimulant drugs in ADHD has increased dramatically in the last 15 years in theUSA, but even more so in some European countries; as a consequence, concernwas raised as to whether these drugs with their known addictive potential arenot heavily overprescribed (Llana and Crismon, 1999).Narcolepsy(ICD G47.4) and other types of hypersomnia are severedisturbances of vigilance expressed as a sudden and irresistible requirementfor sleep during the day, so-called sleep attacks (Aldrich, 1990). Apart fromsleep attacks, the classical tetrad of narcolepsy includes cataplexy (sudden lossof muscular tone), sleep paralysis (waking from sleep with the feeling of notbeing able to move) and hypnagogic hallucinations (images or sequences of24PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"images of great apparent reality when falling asleep). Depending on the severityof the illness, the patient drops off to sleep every few minutes or hours, evenwhen engaged in activities in which he had interest and joy. Narcolepticsyndromes are nowadays treated symptomatically with certain antidepressantsand stimulants, often in combination.1.6.2 THE BEST-KNOWN PSYCHOSTIMULANTSThe best-known products come from the amphetamine group (see Table 1.12):Dexedrine1(generic named-amphetamine) and Pervitin1(methamphetamine)were particularly used in the 1950s and 1960s as stimulants and also as appetitesuppressants, but today play hardly any role in medical practice. Ritalin1(methylphenidate) has some relevance: its psychostimulant action is said to beweaker than that of amphetamines and it is apparently less abused than thelatter. Because methylphenidate also possesses mild antidepressant activity, insome countries it is used to combat not only narcolepsy and ADHD but alsomild depressions without suicide risk (Satel and Nelson, 1989).Some of the adverse effects associated with the use of psychostimulantsinclude: anorexia, nausea, weight loss, insomnia, nightmares, dizziness,irritability, dysphoria, agitation, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, increasein tics and dyskinesias (Sadock and Sadock, 2001). Use of psychostimulants inchildren with ADHD may cause transient retardation of body growth.1.7 NOOTROPICS AND ANTIDEMENTIA DRUGSAccording to a definition by Coper and Kanowski (1983, p. 409), nootropicsare ‘‘centrally acting drugs intended to improve higher integrative noetic brainfunctions such as memory and the ability to learn, perceive, think andMODERN PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS25Table 1.12A selection of well-known psychostimulants (Sadock and Sadock, 2001).Reproduced by permission of Lippincott Williams & WilkinsTrade nameGeneric nameDose (mg) UseAdderall1Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine5–305–60ADHDNarcolepsyConcerta1Methylphenidate18–54ADHDCylert1Pemoline56.25–112.5 ADHDDesoxyn1, Pervitin1Methamphetamine20–45ADHDDexedrine1, Dextrostat1Dextroamphetamine5–30ADHDProvigil1Modafinil100–400NarcolepsyRitalin1, Methidate1,Methylin1, Attenade1Methylphenidate5–6020–30ADHDNarcolepsy"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"concentrate, but for which a specific, uniform mechanism of action is notknown’’. The expression ‘nootropic’ was not adopted everywhere; someauthors used terms such as ‘brain metabolism enhancers’ for this class ofcompounds. Nootropics were found to have beneficial effects on mild cognitiveand affective symptoms of incipient senile dementia (Orgogozo and Spiegel,1987). The actions of these substances were considered to be of some medicalsignificance insofar as they contributed to keeping elderly patients independentfor longer so that they could continue to live in their own homes. Well-knownnootropic drugs are Hydergine1(co-dergocrine mesylate) and Nootropil1(piracetam); however, owing to their limited efficacy, the use of nootropicdrugs has declined in most countries in latter years.Recently, a number of compounds with cholinesterase inhibitory action havebeen introduced for the treatment of mild to moderate cognitive deficits andother symptoms of Alzheimer-type dementia. These compounds increasecholinergic neurotransmission and lead to the improvement of memory andother cognitive functions compared with patients treated with placebo.Activities of daily life (ADLs) are stabilized and demented patients withbehavioral symptoms may show some improvement. Examples includedonepezil (Aricept1), rivastigmine (Exelon1), tacrine (Cognex1) and galanta-mine (Reminyl1). A more detailed account on these agents is provided inChapter 7.1.8 CONCLUDING COMMENTThe foregoing sections apply a classification of psychopharmaceuticals basedon the major therapeutic uses of these drugs. However, it should be emphasizedthat the boundaries between the substance classes are not as clear-cut as theterms used might suggest. Thus, low-dose antipsychotics are sometimes used asanxiolytics or for the calming of agitated patients with depression, and somesedative antidepressants can be useful in patients with chronic insomnia.Antidepressants, in particular SSRIs and SNRIs, are increasingly beingprescribed for a variety of anxiety disorders, and benzodiazepine anxiolytics inlarge doses or in combination with antipsychotics are sometimes applied inpatients with acute schizophrenia. These overlapping clinical uses ofpsychopharmaceuticals also reflect the fact that schizophrenia and depressionare regularly accompanied by episodes of disturbed sleep, agitation andanxiety, and that anxiety disorders and depressive syndromes may share anumber of clinical features. Pharmacotherapy in psychiatry is often symptom-or syndrome- rather than disease-orientated.26PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"2The History of Psychopharmacology2.1 INTRODUCTIONWhen was psychopharmacology born? Is it, in fact, possible to pinpoint the dateof its birth? Historical accounts yield a variety of replies: Hordern (1968) beginshis history of psychopharmacology with Emil Kraepelin who, in 1882,embarked on a series of trials with various psychoactive substances in thelaboratory of Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig, and who is looked upon asthe founder of pharmacopsychology (see Chapter 3). Caldwell (1978) dates thebirth of psychopharmacology as being 1951, with ‘‘the utilization of drugs inrestoring or maintaining mental health and for exploring the mind’’. This yearsaw the discovery of the effect of chlorpromazine. In the opinion of Sack and DeFraites (1977) the modern era of psychopharmacology begins with theobservation by J. Cade of the antimanic effect of lithium at the end of the 1940s.We do not know when, and in what context, the term ‘psychopharmaceutical’(psychopharmakon) was first used. In 1548, i.e. in the transitional periodbetween the Middle Ages and modern times, a collection of prayers ofconsolation and prayers for the dead was published under the titlePsycho-pharmakon, hoc est: medicina animae. The booklet was written by ReinhardusLorichius of Hadamar, a member of the landed gentry of the German ‘Land’ ofHesse. Here the term ‘psychopharmakon’ relates to a spiritual medicine, which isto be used in miserable and hopeless situations of life.Apart from psychopharmaceuticals in the spiritual sense, at all times and inmost cultures psychotropic plant drugs have played a role in religious practices,magic rituals and healing.

The Sumeriansliving in the Tigris–Euphrates area 3000 yearsBCplanted poppies and obtainedits juice, which they called ‘lucky’ or ‘happy’, an indication that they well knewthe mood-lightening, euphoriant action of opium. Finds from the secondmillenniumBCin Asia Minor, Cyprus, Mycenae and Egypt show opium as asmoking material and healing agent; depending on the context, the opiumpoppy also stands as a symbol of fertility, sleep, death or immortality.The sleep-inducing and analgesic actions of opium are described in the best-known medical writings from ancient times, theCorpus HippocraticumandGalen’sOpus. There is no mention of the risk of addiction, although Galenwarns against overdosage and advises that the action of opium be attenuatedby the addition of other substances; opium (under the name oflaudanum) wasalmost always contained in the many variants oftheriak, a compoundedpanacea known best in the Middle Ages.Paracelsus, renowned physician and medical writer in the first half of thesixteenth century, called opium the philosopher’s stone of immortality. InEuropean medicine of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries opium foundwide use as an analgesic and sedative, although its abuse had become knownfrom journeys of discovery to the Near and Far East. In the early nineteenthcentury a German pharmacist, Friedrich Sertu ̈rner, isolated the particularlyactive morphine from natural opium and this became widely used in militarymedicine as an analgesic and anesthetic in the latter half of that century.The resin of hemp (Cannabis sativa) is known ashashish; the term marihuanadesignates the dried flowers, bracts and upper leaves of the female hemp plant.The intoxicating action of hashish was known to some peoples of ancient timesbut, except for its use against ear diseases, cannabis was never used in medicine.Hashish was very widely consumed in the Islamic world of the Middle Agesand even in Europe this intoxicant repeatedly appeared, although sporadicallyand often as a modish fad. However, hashish never played a recognized role inmedicine and thus does not count as a psychopharmaceutical agent.Helleboreroot has been the psychopharmaceutical agentpar excellenceatvarious times. It is a plant of the Ranunculaceae family, the roots of which, aswe now know, contain several glycosides, some of them rather toxic. Whitehellebore was traditionally used as an emetic (Vomitivum) and black helleboreas a laxative (Purgativum); in both cases the guiding principle was that amental illness has a physical cause that can be treated by physical effects,28PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"preferably by the removal of pathogenic substances from the body. Helleborewas so well known that it was mentioned in classical comedies: Aristophanes(Wasps, 1489) uses ‘‘go drink hellebore’’ to mean ‘‘you’re crazy’’, and Plautus(Pseudolus, 1185) also means much the same when he says that some peopleshould drink hellebore, i.e. should see a psychiatrist.Hellebore found a very wide range of uses: mania, melancholy, inflammationof the brain and mental retardation were included among the indications justas much as epilepsy, hydrophobia, violent temper and crazy ideas (Wittern,1983, p. 14). White and black hellebore could be combined and there is nodifficulty in believing the ancient authors when they state that the simultaneousemetic and laxative treatment has a good calming effect! The use of helleboredeclined in the nineteenth century because the product is difficult to dose andcan induce seizures in higher doses.Decoctions ofRauwolfia serpentina(snakeroot) roots traditionally were usedby Indians as a remedy for snake bites and also as a calming agent in somemental illnesses. The plant and its properties were known in Europe in thesixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when rauwolfia made a successful career asa remedy for almost everything but without finding a preferential position inpsychiatry. Only in the early 1950s, after the active constituents of rauwolfiawere discovered and produced in pure form, did the highly sedative andhypotensive alkaloid reserpine find transient use as an agent to controlschizophrenic psychoses (Frankenburg, 1994).2.2.2 PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND THE HISTORY OFPSYCHIATRYThe precursors of modern psychopharmaceuticals, i.e. opium, hellebore andrauwolfia, cannot be considered in isolation but only by reference to theircontemporary healing arts. Mental illnesses and their possible treatment haveconfronted people with the same questions at all times: where do the irrationalideas and impulses of the insane come from – their moods, notions, anxietyand illogical behavior? Have these people sinned so that God has now cast anevil spirit into them as a punishment? What is this evil spirit: a spirit of nature,the ghost of an ancestor, a devil? Or is it the patient’s sick body that producesthe delusions without an outside agent – an unknown disease, a poison fromwithin?In the history of psychiatry, sketched here in just a few paragraphs, thedifferent views held of man at different times are reflected in the constantswings between naturalistic and spiritualistic concepts of disease and thecorresponding therapeutic approaches (see Kirchhoff, 1912; Heiberg, 1927;Ackerknecht, 1967; Shorter, 1997).InEgyptat the time of the Pharaohs, mental illnesses were a result of thewrath of gods, or even an expression of possession by demons. In agreementHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY29"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"with this concept, the treatment given by the priest or doctor comprised:punishment or penance to appease the gods; exorcism and other means ofdriving out the demons; or the patient was isolated or banished to protectothers from the frightening state. There is no record of the way in whichopium, known in ancient Egypt, was part of the therapeutic procedures.TheOld Testamentcontains the impressive story about the first king ofIsrael, Saul, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel, whereupon ‘‘the spiritof God came over him’’, i.e. Saul had superhuman powers that even otherscould perceive. After the battle against the arch enemy, Amalek, in which Sauldid not follow God’s instructions, the spirit of God left him and ‘‘an evil spiritsent from God tormented him’’ (1 Samuel, 16: 14); Saul became depressed,suspicious and subject to outbursts of anger. David, the later son-in-law andeventual successor, could initially soothe the king with singing and harping, butSaul’s state subsequently deteriorated and he broke down after a seriousmilitary reverse in Gilboa. His illness seemed to be a dark fate sent by God;Saul became increasingly entangled in guilt from which he found no way out,and even David’s singing and all efforts to restore his mental balance remainedineffective.The start of a scientific approach to mental health is generally attributed tothe ancient Greeks. In the sixth centuryBC, Alkmaeon of Croton carried outsystematic autopsies and discovered the pathways connecting the eye and earswith the brain. As a result, the brain was seen as the seat of reason and the soul.Around 400BC, Hippocrates and his school placed natural, i.e. physical, causesin the foreground: mental illnesses are expressions or results of an imbalancebetween the body fluids (humors), which are normally present in harmoniousproportions. Thehumoral theory of Hippocrates, certainly one of the mostinfluential concepts in the history of psychology and psychiatry, counted onfour basic fluids corresponding to four temperaments or character types and, inthe case of pathological predominance of one component, to four mentalillnesses (see Table 2.1).Because mental illnesses are due to an imbalance between the body fluids,treatment must seek to restore the balance. Methods directed to the body wererecommended, such as diet, bathing and showering, blood-letting and laxatives(hellebore).The original writings of Hippocrates and his school have not been handeddown to us. They reached Alexandria around 300BCand were summarized bythe Roman author Celsus in the first centuryAD. The need for individualadaptation of each therapy was stressed here: frightened patients are to bereassured in a friendly manner; manic patients should be chained and perhapsstarved; music and poetry lift the melancholy; the mad should be shunned orbrought to other thoughts by sudden noises; and adequate sleep should beensured for all patients. Poppy (opium) and henbane were available for this,but rippling fountains could also have a calming and soporific action.30PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The major authority for medicine in the Middle Ages wasGalenofPergamon, who worked in Rome in the second centuryAD. Galen adopted thehumoral theory of Hippocrates, including the classification of mental illnesses,and his therapeutic recommendations were also based on the tradition of theHippocratic school: diet, vomiting, blood-letting and the administration ofsoporifics.TheMiddle Agesare not a high spot in the history of psychiatry. This wasthe time of possession by the devil and demons, of mass movements with aclearly pathological nature (flagellants, children’s crusade), witch-burning andgruesome exorcism of spirits. Science and medicine did not develop further inChristian Europe because ‘‘the little that the Greeks knew was lost and anawful regression to earlier cultural stages occurred’’ (Ackerknecht, 1967, p. 18).However, this statement does not apply to the Islamic world: the Hippocratic–Galenic tradition was propagated further by Arabic doctors, and hospitalswith separate departments for the mentally ill were available in BaghdadaroundAD750 and in Cairo fromAD873. Treatment was based on theexperience of the ancient world, so that measures directed to the body werepredominantly used to overcome mental illnesses.In the early Christian Middle Ages, however, a tradition arose that had abeneficial impact on the mentally ill, despite the fanaticism and incitement oflater centuries: the tradition ofmercy. Prayers were said for the possessed andthe Church initially saw itself as a haven for the insane and epileptics also. Onlyin the eleventh century were some madmen considered to be envoys of thedevil, to be combated by all available means; in the fourteenth century therewas a change to isolating the insane from the healthy population in lunaticasylums and madhouses. Therapeutic measures for those isolated in this waywere superfluous at that time, especially as those who knew about herbs andpoisons were often themselves suspected of being witches (Duerr, 1979).Between the Middle Ages and modern times stand physicians such asParacelsus (1491–1541), Johann Weyer (1515–1588) and Felix Plater (1536–1614), who turned more or less clearly against the concepts of witches andspirits that prevailed at that time, and restored natural causes to the centre-stage of mental illnesses. They had no new treatments to offer and, true to theGalenic tradition, prescribed blood-letting and purging to clean the bodyHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY31Table 2 .1Basis of the humoral theory of HippocratesHumorTemperament: affectivityMental illnessBloodSanguine: lively and weakMania, insanityPhlegmPhlegmatic: slow and weakCalm insanityBlack bileMelancholic: slow and strongMelancholyCholerCholeric: lively and strongHysteria, especially in women"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"fluids, baths and massages for relaxation and to strengthen the body, andsoporifics and sedatives to stabilize excited minds.2.3 THE MODERN AGE: PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYBEFORE CHLORPROMAZINEIn the Age of Enlightenment and absolutism, psychiatry developed in differentdirections in the different European countries depending on local political andsocial circumstances (see Schrenk, 1973; Do ̈rner, 1975; Foucault, 1978). Theessential features of this development, which occurred in all countries sooner orlater, are:(1) Thespatial segregation of the insanein houses that often lay outside thecities and towns, sometimes in one-time leper colonies.(2) The gradual rediscovery of themedical modelof mental illnesses,associated with research into pathological anatomical causes.(3) Attempts to return the insane (the social outcasts) to a normal life bymeans of work, useful tasks and a regulated daily routine, and to supportthem asmembers of society.It is clear that these trends are contradictory to some extent. A spatiallysegregated patient cannot lead a normal life in society. The medical model ofmental illnesses, with its objective of detecting and, where applicable,correcting anatomical or functional disorders in the patient’s body, contradictsa socially orientated concept of the illness underpinning treatment byeducational methods. Modern psychiatry has grown up with these contra-dictions and still lives with them today (Rosen, 1969).Psychopharmacology emerged very gradually in modern times. One of theearliest compendia of psychopharmacology to appear in German was writtenby P.J. Schneider (1824), and describes in some 600 pages the methods ofpsychiatric therapy used at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Thedescription lacks discrimination in several respects and includes manymeasures that to us seem cruel or naive, insufficiently tested and oftencontradictory. Some 400 pages are devoted to ‘Materia Medica’ and it is herethat the majority of medicinal recommendations are to be found. Manypractices described in these Materia Medica are reminiscent of a torturechamber rather than of a hospital (Table 2.2) – and yet the author assures hisreaders that some of these measures were therapeutically effective in well-documented cases.Psychotropic agents, in today’s sense of the term, were classified bySchneider into the classes ‘narcotic agents’ and ‘excitants, analeptics’. The listof allegedly useful substances, plants and extracts is extensive and colorful.Critical evaluation of the recommended active agents is hampered by the fact32PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"HISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY33Table 2 . 2Materia Medica (after Schneider, 1824)Antagonists(for use in cases of excessivenervous sensitivity and insufficientphysical sensitivity)Antiphlogistics(temperature-reducingmeasures)Narcotic agents(calming agents)Excitants, analeptics(nerve-invigorating agents)A.

What does emerge clearly fromthis account is that Schneider numbered amongst the most effectivemedicaments the thorn apple (Datura stramonium), alraun, prussic acid,opium and belladonna. Alraun (Mandragora), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger)and belladonna (Atropa belladonna) are some of the traditional ingredients ofwitches’ ointments and potions, to which was added the thorn apple at thebeginning of the modern era (see Caldwell, 1978; Duerr, 1979).Psychiatry as a discipline of medicine made considerable advances inEngland and France in the early nineteenth century. A classification of mentalillnesses based on precise clinical observations and statistical comparison wasdeveloped by Philippe Pinel (1745–1826) and Jean E ́tienne Esquirol (1772–1840), and the cruellest of the treatment methods, including chaining theinsane, had already been discontinued by the turn of the century in Paris. In1818, Esquirol drew up an expert report on madhouses in France at the requestof the French Home Office, and this shattering report led to a thorough reformof psychiatry. In his textbook of 1838, Esquirol spoke of ‘‘maladie mentale’’(‘mental illness’) instead of the previously used term ‘alienation’, and thusannounced the victory of the medical model over spiritualistic concepts ofpsychiatric diseases. With Wilhelm Griesinger (1817–1868), the German schoolof psychiatry underwent a similar transformation and, under Emil Kraepelin(1856–1926), a psychiatric classification was created, the essential features ofwhich still remain valid today.Griesinger’s textbook of psychiatry (1861) gives extensive information ononly a very few centrally acting medicaments; particularly recommended areopium, ether and chloroform narcoses, as well as prussic acid. Opium wasobserved in appropriate cases to ‘‘calm the sick, reduce hallucinations, dispelfeelings of anxiety as well as delusions related thereto and occasionally to bringabout their complete cure’’ (p. 488). Above all, younger patients whose ailmenthad not yet become chronic could, in Griesinger’s experience, benefit fromopium treatment – and interestingly enough no mention is made of thedevelopment of addiction.Following narcoses, induced using either ether or chloroform, there was‘‘often (but by no means consistently) a temporary remission of themelancholia and mania. . . now and then even a completelucidum inter-vallum. . . but the earlier clinical picture soon reappeared’’ (p. 489). Accordingto Griesinger’s observations, repeated use of ether and chloroform leads to theremissions becoming briefer and soon disappearing completely. The hope thathad been laid on the medical treatment of mental disorders with these newsynthetic substances was thus not fulfilled. Prussic acid is a secondary remedylisted by Griesinger and was said to be capable of calming moderate exaltation,melancholic anxiety and similar states. The author made no further remarks34PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"concerning other remedies (datura, belladonna, quinine and hashish) listed inhis book.Griesinger devoted only little space to the use of medicaments in thetreatment of mental illness, but Kraepelin’s textbook of psychiatry (1899) madevarious references to the use of pharmaceuticals in the treatment of thementally ill. Some of these are preparations having a certain tradition inpsychiatry, whereas others were substances that had been discovered in theintervening period (Table 2.3). And yet, comparison of this list withGriesinger’s recommendations shows how little progress had been made inthe 40 or so years that had elapsed; although the number of hypnotics hadgrown somewhat, no fundamentally new types of activity had been found.A similar stagnation is apparent when one compares the first eight editionsof theLehrbuch der Psychiatrie(Textbook of Psychiatry) by Eugen Bleuler,which appeared between 1916 and 1949. Although the heading ‘Hypnotics’already appears in the index of the first edition, the concept ‘Treatment withmedicaments’ only appears in 1949, in the eighth edition. All in all, Bleulerused pharmaceuticals much more restrictively than Griesinger and Kraepelin;he regarded opium as a risky remedy that should be avoided in view of thedanger of habituation. He also rejects alcohol – which was still recommendedby Kraepelin in 1899 – owing to the risk of alcoholism and in its placeHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY35Table 2 . 3Psychopharmaceuticals listed by Kraepelin (1899)1.Narcotics: medicaments with calming actionOpium: excitation, anxiety states and pain-induced unrest respond to it; also prolongedmanic statesMorphine: similar to opium, but simpler to dose.

Asregards hypnotics proper, he advises against their prolonged use and suggeststhat the remedies be changed from time to time in order to prevent anyhabituation (Table 2.4). This reserved approach towards drug-based therapyremained unchanged throughout the following editions of his textbook and, asalready stated, hardly any additions were made to Bleuler’s list ofrecommended preparations between 1916 and 1949.Apart from the slow progress in psychiatric pharmacotherapy it is strikingthat although Griesinger, Kraepelin and Bleuler cited a large number ofsedatives and hypnotics their recommendation included no stimulatingmedicaments of any kind. Whereas several preparations were available thatcould be used to sedate raging, anxious, restless or sleep-disturbed patients, thepsychiatrists of the time were virtually powerless in the face of depressive andstuporous states, if one discounts the not generally accepted use of opium.Here, a certain degree of progress was attained with the shock therapies:insulin-induced coma, cardiazole-induced shock and, in particular, electro-shock. Amphetamine was synthesized in 1927 and, owing to its stimulatingproperties, was used to a growing extent in the 1930s against narcolepsy andsimilar disorders. However, it never acquired any great importance inpsychiatric pharmacotherapy because it only displayed a modest effect instates of exhaustion and slight depression, while remaining virtually ineffectivein endogenous depression.2.4 THE DISCOVERY OF MODERNPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS2.4.1 CHLORPROMAZINEDetailed accounts of the discovery of chlorpromazine as an antipsychotic drughave been given by two authors (Caldwell, 1970; Swazey, 1974); an abridged36PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 2 .4Psychopharmaceuticals recommended by Bleuler (1916).

It emerges clearly from all thesedescriptions that the discovery of the first neuroleptic drug was not the workof a single physician, scientist or research group. Nor did it emerge as the resultof a planned research project aimed at finding a pharmacological therapy forschizophrenia. What in fact happened was that several initially unrelateddevelopmental trends converged at the end of the 1940s in the most fortuitousfashion and, owing to precise clinical observations on the part of severaldoctors, led to the most significant advance in psychiatric therapy for manyyears. Swazey (1974) regards the following factors as critical:.The efforts made by the French surgeon Laborit to find a safer anesthetictechnique and to prevent surgical shock..A pharmacological development program embarked on by the drugcompany Rhoˆ ne–Poulenc in Paris to screen for medicaments having anantihistamine action..The readiness to experiment displayed by several biologically interestedpsychiatrists trying out pharmacological remedies to more effectivepsychiatric therapy.Of special interest is the contribution made by Henri Laborit, who had workedas an army surgeon during the Second World War and who, under theinfluence of his war experiences, devoted himself in subsequent years primarilyto the problem of shock.The term ‘shock’ when used in medicine relates to an acute state of generalweakness and the restriction of many vital functions. Patients in shock aregenerally apathetic, their face is sunken and their expression is full of anxiety;skin is moist, cold and gray, pulse is rapid and faint, blood pressure is normallylow, musculature is lax and superficial blood vessels are empty; respiration issuperficial, basal metabolism is reduced and urine formation is considerablyslower. Shock may be triggered by a variety of causes: severe physical injurywith excessive loss of blood, surgery or severe psychic trauma; in predisposedpersons it may also arise as a reaction to exogenous substances such asantibiotics or bee poison.In the 1940s there were various current hypotheses as to the question of thebiological or biochemical mechanisms underlying shock. In his own researchLaborit arrived at the view that endogenous substances having a transmitterfunction (adrenaline, acetylcholine and histamine, see Chapter 4) are involvedin the triggering and full-scale development of shock. In his view, shock is aconsequence of excessively strong biological emergency reactions no longeradapted to the situation, and can be combated by blocking the effects of thetransmitters using appropriate pharmacological agents, if possible at severalpoints simultaneously. In light of this hypothesis, Laborit experimented withHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY37"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"various substances known to have an inhibitory effect on adrenaline,acetylcholine and histamine. These included agents such as procaine, curare,atropine and – the class that was to decide future events – syntheticantihistamines.This is where Laborit’s interests coincided with those of the drug companyRhoˆ ne–Poulenc, which had already embarked on a chemical and pharmaco-logical program to develop antihistamine compounds several years before. Animportant point was reached when promethazine, an antihistamine withpronounced sedative and analgesic properties, was examined clinically byLaborit and other doctors. Not only was this medicament suitable, incombination with other substances, in preventing surgical shock, but Laboritobserved that patients treated with promethazine were quieter and morerelaxed and – even after major surgery – in relatively good spirits.Impressed by this success, Rhoˆ ne–Poulenc decided in 1950 to look for moreantihistamines in the same chemical class as promethazine having an even morepronounced ‘central’ effect. This decision was by no means an obvious one,because the sedative effect of promethazine could barely be characterized usingthe contemporary methods of animal experiments. Furthermore, the sedatingand sleep-inducing effect of promethazine was a distinct disadvantage in sometherapeutic applications (hay fever, other allergies). In October 1950,disregarding these difficulties, P. Koetschet, one of the Rhoˆ ne–Poulenc headsof research, suggested embarking on a goal-directed search for promethazineanalogs with a greater effect on the central nervous system. Although it was notpossible to foresee what therapeutic applications these substances would have,Koetschet envisaged their exploratory use in anesthesiology, in Parkinsonism,in psychiatry and possibly also in epileptic patients. As early as March 1951 asubstance, given the number 4560 RP, was available that was chemicallyrelated to promethazine while revealing a considerably more pronouncedcentral effect in pharmacological tests in animals. In April 1951 human trials of4560 RP commenced and the first applications confirmed that the compoundaugmented the sleep-inducing action of barbiturates and also acted as asedative when used on its own.Laborit obtained 4560 RP in June 1951 and soon recognized the advantagesof the new substance: it lessened the anxiety felt by patients prior to surgery,diminished surgical stress and made it possible to simplify the mixture ofmedicaments used by Laborit – the so-called lytic cocktails. Furthermore, thecompound had a low toxicity and consequently could be used in a broaderdosage rather than, for example, curare.Under the effect of chlorpromazine, as 4560 RP was later to be named,patients did not lose consciousness but merely became sleepy and uninterestedin everything going on around them and being done to them (Laboritet al.,1952). Laborit and co-workers postulated that this strange central actionsuggested the use of chlorpromazine in psychiatry, e.g. in sleep therapy, where38PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"it was hoped to attain an improved effect and greater safety in comparison tohitherto known agents.Laborit was not the only doctor conducting early clinical trials onchlorpromazine at the instigation of Rhoˆ ne–Poulenc; it emerged from reportsgiven by other clinicians that the substance produced a form of sedation inpatients that previously had been unknown. Based on these observations,Rhoˆ ne–Poulenc decided, at the end of 1951, to extend the research program toinclude the mentally ill and to use chlorpromazine, in combination withbarbiturates, experimentally in sleep therapy and in the treatment of manicepisodes. Independently of this, Laborit tried to encourage a few psychiatristspersonally known to him to embark on clinical trials using chlorpromazine inrestless patients. Eventually a group of doctors in a psychiatric militaryhospital decided to conduct an initial trial on a manic patient. After some threeweeks of treatment with chlorpromazine in combination with other sedatives,the patient’s condition improved to such an extent that he could be dischargedand sent home. In a paper presented before the Socie ́te ́Me ́dico-Psychologique,Hamonet al.reported on 25 February 1952 on their initial experiences withchlorpromazine, which they held to be interesting. However, because they didnot consider the sedative effect of the new substance to be strong enough, theypreferred the then customary electroshock therapy.At about this time one of the best-known French psychiatrists of the day,Jean Delay, commenced his own studies with chlorpromazine in conjunctionwith a colleague, Pierre Deniker. Deniker had learnt, by private communica-tions, of Laborit’s experiments with chlorpromazine in anesthesiology, whichwere referred to ashibernation artificielle. He asked Rhoˆ ne–Poulenc for drugsamples and received them in February 1952. Unlike Laborit, who always usedchlorpromazine in combination with other medicaments, Delay and Denikerdecided to administer chlorpromazine without concomitant drugs to manicallyagitated patients. Their first findings were so beneficial that they presented aninitial report to the Socie ́te ́Me ́dico-Psychologique after 3 months, a report thatappeared soon after in written form (Delayet al., 1952). During the followingmonths the same authors published a number of reports in rapid succession onthe effect of chlorpromazine in various psychiatric conditions and thus helpedto make the new medicament known in France and, in part, also abroad.One of the first clinics outside France to show an interest in chlorpromazinewas the Basel University Psychiatric Hospital. A young member of the clinic’sstaff (Felix Labhardt) had been in Paris for postgraduate training from summer1951 to spring 1952 and had heard there of the application of the newsubstance 4560 RP in anesthesiology and psychiatry. An initial therapeutic trialcommenced in Basel in January 1953 and was so successful that a rapidsuccession of patients with quite varied diagnoses underwent chlorpromazinecures. The first publication from the Basel clinic appeared in June 1953(Staehelin and Kielholz, 1953): Largactil1, as the medicament was now named,HISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY39"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"was recommended in ‘‘all severe mental disturbances in which pronouncedvegetative syndromes could be demonstrated’’, particularly in:.emotional psychoses and other psychotic reactions.detoxification cures for addicts.severe neuroses, especially those with symptoms of anxiety and compulsion.symptomatic psychoses tinged with anxiety.certain forms of schizophrenia and manic–depressive psychosisThis list shows clearly the extent to which the fields of indication ofchlorpromazine had broadened in barely one and a half years. Of specialimportance was its use in schizophrenia, which Labhardt presented shortlyafterwards in a comprehensive lecture given at the First Largactil Symposium,held in Basel on 28 November 1953. According to the results presented byStaehelin (the then head of the Basel clinic) of the approximately 500 patientsin the clinic, some 200 were on Largactil1and over 130 discharged patientswere continuing to take the medicament. Figures cited by Staehelin’scolleagues in their lectures were equally impressive: Kielholz reported on theresults of treatment in 52 depressive patients, 16 drug addicts in withdrawaland more than 20 senile patients with nocturnal unrest. Labhardt presenteddata on the treatment of over 200 schizophrenic patients with chlorpromazine.To all this were added reports on therapeutic studies undertaken in otherpsychiatric hospitals in Switzerland and covering over 850 patients.Particularly important consequences arose out of the findings presented byLabhardt (1954) on the treatment of schizophrenics: excellent results wereobtained, not only in recently afflicted patients but also in those who had beenhospitalized for several years. In the case of chronic patients in whom theillness went back over 5 years or more, significant improvements were observedin almost 60% of the cases, and some of the patients who had previously hadan almost hopeless prognosis according to prevailing opinions could bedischarged from hospital.Spectacular findings were not just being recorded with chlorpromazine inParis and Basel; other centres also achieved favourable results. Thanks tochlorpromazine, the character of psychiatric hospitals and of psychiatric carein general underwent a radical change. Lunatic asylums became peacefulhospitals and many patients who previously had to be institutionalized onaccount of the danger they presented to others and to themselves could bedischarged and partially rehabilitated. There was a marked reduction in theaverage stay in psychiatric hospitals. Thanks to chlorpromazine it wasrecognized that not only is schizophrenia an illness that can be treated atleast symptomatically by chemical means, but that it is in many cases an illnessthat can be cured – and the following years were to see a marked upswing inbiologically orientated psychiatry.40PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"2.4.2 ANTIDEPRESSANTSThe history of the first antidepressant, the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitoriproniazid, is a complicated one for a number of reasons (Kline, 1970). Iproniazidwas originally developed by the drug company Hoffmann-La Roche as amedicament for the treatment of tuberculosis, and attracted attention in 1951/52during clinical trials on account of its stimulating and euphoriant effects;nervousness and sleep disorders occurred frequently and yet tubercular patientson iproniazid became cheerful and exuberant – moods strangely out of keepingwith their condition. Initial applications in psychiatry, some in agitated and somein chronically apathetic schizophrenics, failed to lead to interpretable results, andthe use of iproniazid against tuberculosis was increasingly being regarded asrisky, mainly as a consequence of the stimulating effect of the preparation.A more systematic clinical investigation of the antidepressant effect ofiproniazid was only commenced in 1956 after animal experiments hadsuggested that the compound possessed an activity in this area. Pretreatmentof animals with iproniazid prevented the so-called reserpine syndrome in miceand rats; instead of being calm and tame, as is normally the case afterreserpine, animals pretreated with iproniazid became hyperactive and, in somecases, aggressive when given reserpine. Initial clinical trials revealed thatiproniazid had a stimulating and mood-elevating effect in at least some of thepatients with depression. On the other hand, reports kept coming in of sideeffects caused by the preparation and these impeded its broader use. Themanufacturers ultimately withdrew the preparation in the USA and in someother countries but it remained on sale in further markets – a confusingsituation that went on for years (Kline, 1970). Some subsequently introducedMAO inhibitors, such as isocarboxacid and tranylcypromine, were alsowithdrawn after a short time due to various types of side effects.Another, and by no means always straightforward, path was followed by thediscovery of the so-calledthymoleptics, which eventually became moreimportant as antidepressants than the MAO inhibitors. As in the case ofRhoˆ ne–Poulenc, the firm Geigy in Basel had worked during the 1940s onantihistaminic substances that were chemically similar to promethazine andchlorpromazine. In animal experiments one of these compounds, numberG 22150, had an antihistaminic as well as sedative action and was tested in1950 by the Swiss psychiatrist Roland Kuhn in restless patients as a potentialsedative and hypnotic. As Kuhn wrote in 1957: the ‘‘expected action was inmost cases not found to be present...in the doses of0.02–0.06 g used at thattime. However, the preparation seemed to us to exert a pronounced calmingeffect in schizophrenics suffering from agitation, delusions and hallucinations’’.However, ‘‘this effect was assessed too much merely from the one-sided pointof view of tranquillizing activity and hence the special interest of suchsubstances was overlooked’’ (Kuhn, 1957, p. 1135).HISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY41"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"In 1952 the first favorable results were obtained in psychiatry withchlorpromazine and Kuhn was among those psychiatrists to have access tothe newly discovered neuroleptic. And yet, as Kuhn wrote in 1970, oncechlorpromazine was on the market it was too expensive to be used in hishospital in large quantities. He therefore approached Geigy Pharmaceuticals inFebruary 1954, pointing out the similarity between the effect observed withG 22150 and that of chlorpromazine. Further trial samples of G 22150 weresupplied, but it became obvious that the Geigy preparation was inferior tochlorpromazine as an antipsychotic and, in addition, produced disturbing sideeffects. As a result, a further Geigy compound was selected for clinical trials –G 22355, which was chemically even closer to chlorpromazine than wasG 22150. This substance was tested for about a year on some 300 patients withvarious mental illnesses and in spring 1956 Kuhn, to conclude his test series,also treated a few patients suffering from endogenous depression. It wasdiscovered with surprise that the substance, later to be calledimipramine, had amarked antidepressant effect that Kuhn (1957) described as follows:.The patients’ facial expression relaxes and regains expressivity. The patientsbecome livelier, friendlier and more sociable. They talk more and louder..The moaning, crying and complaining stops; remarks relating to physicalcomplaints decrease..The patients get up in the morning of their own accord and undertakeactivities under their own initiative; their lethargic pace of living returns tonormal..The patients realize their improvement; feelings of heaviness, weakness andoppression decrease; feelings of guilt and depressive delusions disappear..Suicidal ideas and tendencies recede..Sleep disturbances and oppressive dreams become rarer. Daily mood swingswith morning lows, lack of appetite and constipation cease.According to Kuhn’s observations, the effect of imipramine becameapparent in some cases after a few days; in other cases several weeks passedbefore any therapeutic effect could be seen. He estimated his failure rate at 20–25%, but regarded his sample as too small for any reliable estimate to be made.If the medicament was discontinued too soon, there was said to be a danger ofrelapse. It was also not possible to ascertain from his observations whetherimipramine shortened the natural duration of the depressive phase. The besttherapeutic successes were recorded in ‘‘endogenous depression and in cases ofdepression which first appeared at the menopause, in cases where vitalsymptoms were clearly in the foreground’’. Kuhn also provided a comprehen-sive list of side effects of imipramine, which nevertheless in his view did notappreciably restrict use of the medicament. (None of the claims regarding theclinical pattern of action of imipramine made by Kuhn on the basis of open42PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"studies on 300 patients, 40 of whom suffered from endogenous depression, hadto be withdrawn or significantly modified later.)In contrast to iproniazid and imipramine, which were synthesized in theearly 1950s and then tested in man,lithiumhad been known to medicine foralmost 100 years before John Cade became aware of its specific antimanicaction (see Cade, 1970). The starting point of this Australian psychiatrist’sinvestigations was a hypothesis regarding the etiology of manic–depressiveillness, according to which manic phases were triggered by poisoning due to asurplus of an endogenous substance, whereas the depressive phase was due to adeficiency of the same substance. In order to test this hypothesis, Cade injectedthe urine from manic patients into guinea pigs and found this urine to displaygreater toxicity than that of healthy subjects. He then began a search forsubstances that would protect the guinea pigs from the effects of the manicpatients’ urine. Via a few intermediate steps he came across lithium salts, whichhad the desired effect. In addition he noticed that, with the administration oflithium, the animals became lethargic and showed virtually no reaction tostimuli, although they did not lapse into a state of sleep. As Cade wrote later:‘‘It may seem a long way from lethargy in guinea pigs to the control of manicexcitement, but as these investigations had commenced in an attempt todemonstrate some possibly excreted toxin in the urine of manic patients, theassociation of ideas is explicable’’ (1970, p. 223). In any event, Cade conductedhis first trials with lithium in manic patients in 1948 and reported very goodtherapeutic findings in 10 out of 10 patients.Despite this favorable result, lithium was hardly considered as apsychopharmaceutical for many years. There were a variety of reasons forthis. Firstly, mania is not a very common psychosis and there is spontaneousremission in many cases. There were thus not so many occasions where lithiumtreatment was indicated. Secondly, lithium salts were considered to be toxicbecause for some time they had been given in excessive doses to patients withheart failure and in this way, had led to a number of fatalities (Cade, 1970).Thirdly, a few years after Cade’s first publication psychiatrists’ attention hadbeen claimed by chlorpromazine and the subsequent neuroleptics andantidepressants, thus explaining why lithium almost fell into oblivion. It wasonly in the 1960s that it once more attracted some interest, after the Danishpsychiatrist Mogens Schou had shown that lithium salts were not only useful inthe manic phase of manic–depressive illness but also could prevent depressiveepisodes in patients suffering from bipolar psychoses.2.4.3 TRANQUILLIZERSThe discoveries of chlorpromazine and imipramine are generally regarded asgreater scientific advances than that of the tranquillizers. However, in makingthe public aware of the fact that mental disturbances can be treated withHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY43"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"chemical agents, tranquillizers – owing to their widespread use – played asimportant a role as neuroleptics and antidepressants.Sedatives – above all, low dosages of sleep-inducing agents – were thehistoric precursors of tranquillizers but their use was severely restricted byserious disadvantages: a narrow therapeutic dose range and the risk ofhabituation and addiction. A first link in the chain leading to moderntranquillizers was forged by the compoundmephenesine, which producedmuscle relaxation, calm and a sleep-like state in animal experiments.Mephenesine was part of a chemical development program that had beenstarted shortly after the Second World War in an English pharmaceuticalcompany (British Drug Houses), aimed at finding compounds active againstpenicillin-resistant bacteria. The pronounced muscle-relaxing action ofmephenesine became apparent during toxicological testing (Berger, 1970), asa result of which clinical trials commenced to examine the muscle-relaxantproperties of this substance. It soon became evident that mephenesine was notonly muscle-relaxing but also anxiety-relieving and psychically relaxing,leaving the patient’s mind clear and free of any mental impairment.Mephenesine is rapidly broken down in the organism and therefore its effectis only of short duration. At an early stage, therefore, chemists directed theirefforts at finding longer-acting, i.e., more slowly metabolized, analogs ofmephenesine. Many preparations were synthesized and some were evenmarketed (see Ban, 1969, p. 313) butmeprobamatewas the first to displaythe desired profile of action because it had pronounced muscle-relaxing andanxiolytic effects, adequate therapeutic safety margin and a long duration ofaction. Although the pharmacological profile of meprobamate was known asearly as 1954, the substance was only accepted clinically as a tranquillizer in1957. In the ensuing years, the practical application of meprobamate expandedto cover what was called neurotic tension and complaints of all kinds, and thecompound enjoyed great commercial success only to be halted with the adventof the benzodiazepines.The history of thebenzodiazepineshas been set down by their inventor, thePolish–American chemist L. Sternbach (1978). He tells how in the mid-1950sHoffman-La Roche, in light of the success of the first psychopharmaceuticals,decided to investigate this field also. Of the possible approaches to chemicalresearch and development – modification of already known and activemolecules, synthetic work based on a specific biochemical hypothesis, synthesisof substances belonging to new chemical classes and their pharmacologicalscreening in known experimental models – the firm chose the latter. Sternbachbased his synthetic chemical work on a class of substances that he hadexamined earlier when working at the University of Cracow. Decisive in thischoice was the fact that few scientists had concentrated on this class ofchemicals and Hoffmann-La Roche consequently could expect to achieve alarge number of patentable compounds. Furthermore, this class of substances44PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"was, as Sternbach emphasized, interesting for the chemist for scientific andtechnical reasons.Regardless of these advantages, the newly synthesized compounds proved tobe pharmacologically uninteresting and the program was consequently haltedin 1957. Sternbach himself assumed new duties and was in the process ofclearing the laboratory for new work when he came across two substances thathad been synthesized earlier but had not yet been subjected to pharmacologicaltests. Without any great hopes, one of these substances was sent forpharmacological screening. Contrary to expectation, it proved to be effectivein the series of tests designed to indicate a tranquillizing effect. In mice thecompound was muscle-relaxing, sedating, anticonvulsant and antiaggressive,and these effects were confirmed in other species of animals. The molecule, laterto be called chlordiazepoxide (Librium1), was more effective in all thepharmacological tests than the reference substance meprobamate. It was nothypnotic even at high doses, had no vegetative effects and its toxicity was verylow. A taming effect was observed in rhesus monkeys, which can be veryvicious in captivity.Initial clinical trials were conducted in geriatric patients in spring 1958;although the substance clearly displayed the expected sedative properties, it ledto severe ataxia and speech disturbances (Cohen, 1970), for which reason theclinical trials were interrupted for some months. A member of the Hoffmann-La Roche clinical research department then had the idea of having lower dosesof the preparation tested by practising psychiatrists in outpatients sufferingfrom neurotic disorders. The results of these additional studies wereencouraging: chlordiazepoxide led to a reduction in tension and states ofanxiety, without causing any significant side effects such as disturbedwakefulness and impaired mental functioning. The preparation had a broadtherapeutic range and no toxic effects were observed in man. ‘‘This added up toan easily manipulated drug having a wide range of clinical application andminimal toxicity’’ (Cohen, 1970, p. 134). In view of these positive results,clinical trials were stepped up and as early as autumn 1959 a symposium washeld in which reports were presented on experiences with chlordiazepoxide inseveral thousand patients. The US health authorities – the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) – approved the medicament Librium1in February1960, 2 years after commencement of clinical trials.2.5 DISCUSSION: HOW WERE MODERNPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS DISCOVERED?All prototypes of modern psychopharmaceuticals (lithium, chlorpromazine,meprobamate, imipramine and chlordiazepoxide) were discovered in a periodof about 10 years (Fig. 2.1). Neither before nor since has such a series ofHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY45"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"therapeutic advances been made in psychiatry. Several authors dealing with thehistory of modern psychopharmacology have thus raised the question of whichfactors made a decisive contribution to the discovery of modern psychophar-maceuticals within such a short time. Two partially negative answers cancertainly be given: the discoveries followed no common pattern; and neither inthe case of lithium nor in the case of chlorpromazine or imipramine can onespeak of goal-directed developments whereby a substance was developed, onthe basis of pathophysiological knowledge and a given pharmacologicalhypothesis, with a specific therapeutic indication in view. To recapitulate thesequence of events once more:.Chlorpromazine emerged from a series of compounds that aroused interestmainly on account of their antihistaminic effects, and partly theiranticholinergic effects..Imipramine also came from a class of substances having antihistaminicproperties, and was earmarked and tested clinically as a possible competitorto chlorpromazine..Meprobamate was a further development based on another medicament(mephenesine), the muscle-relaxant effects of which had attracted attentionas a side effect during toxicological trials.46PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 2.1The discovery of psychiatric somatotherapies"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":".In the case of MAO inhibitors also, a side effect that had been observed inconjunction with their use for another indication (tuberculosis) wasconverted into a therapeutic effect for a different group of patients.Only in the case of chlordiazepoxide can one speak in terms of goal-directeddevelopment; here the intention was to find tranquillizing compounds in a newand patentable class of substances. In no case, however, was there abiochemical hypothesis concerning the illness or symptoms to be treated thatwould have led to the rational synthesis and development of appropriatepharmaceuticals.2.5.1 CHANCE DISCOVERYAre the major discoveries in psychopharmacology based oncoincidenceand, ifso, what is meant by coincidence? A stroke of luck, whereby some psychiatrist,somewhere, experimenting with some kind of substance unexpectedly hits on amajor discovery, can certainly be ruled out in the case of chlorpromazine. Foryears Laborit had considered pharmacological ways of preventing shock,during which time he had systematically looked for suitable compounds andcombinations of substances. Delay’s and Deniker’s efforts to alleviatepsychoses by pharmacological means had had a long tradition; theirexperiments with chlorpromazine followed many trials using other sympathi-colytic and anticholinergic substances. The same holds true for the Basel clinic,where the therapeutic indications of chlorpromazine were expanded system-atically. An example to the contrary is given by Laborit’s colleagues Hamonand co-workers, who were the first to test chlorpromazine in psychiatry (beforeDelay and Deniker) but did not recognize its potential.How are the discoveries of imipramine, meprobamate, chlordiazepoxide andlithium to be judged in this context? According to their inventors, luck wasalways involved, albeit in quite different ways. In Cade’s own version of thestory the choice of lithium as a medicament against mania was made on thebasis of unrelated factors; in his experiments on the toxic effect of the urine ofmanic patients he was looking for a water-soluble form of uric acid and, in sodoing, came across lithium urate. This molecule quite unexpectedly reduced thetoxicity of the uric acid. Instead of lithium urate, Cade subsequently usedlithium carbonate, which also protected his guinea pigs from the toxic effects ofuric acid, and this was the background against which the history of lithium as apsychopharmaceutical started. Had it not been for Cade’s systematic methodof working, the chance discovery of lithium might never have been made.Looking back on it today, it would seem that chance played a smaller role inthe discovery of the antidepressant effect of imipramine. The antimanic effectof lithium had already been recognized – although lithium was only being usedin a few clinics – and the recently discovered antipsychotic effect ofHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY47"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"chlorpromazine suggested that major psychiatric disorders could be treatedwith pharmacological agents. Clinical trials in psychiatry with the chlorpro-mazine-like substances synthesized at Geigy Pharmaceuticals were therefore alogical step. The critical contribution here was the persistent way in whichKuhn, in close cooperation with scientific staff at Geigy (Broadhurst, 1998),conducted his clinical studies. Kuhn’s personal conviction – a sort of magicalbelief that depression could be cured with pharmacological means – alsoplayed its part (Kuhn, 1970) and, taken together with the high price ofchlorpromazine and the tight budget of a (non-university) psychiatric hospitalin the mid-1950s, was probably decisive.According to Sternbach’s account of the discovery of chlordiazepoxide,chance was also at work in the laboratories of Hoffmann-La Roche, althoughin a different way; of the series of substances that Sternbach had synthesized,why should it have been chlordiazepoxide, of all others, that had been leftbehind untested in the chemist’s laboratory? Rather than stressing this chanceoccurrence, the well-conducted clinical trial of the experimental preparationshould be emphasized instead. This study was not restricted to a singleindication or dosage range, but was extended – in the face of initialunfavorable results – into those indications within which the then standardpreparation meprobamate achieved its best results (Cohen, 1970).2.5.2 SERENDIPITY AND SPIRIT OF THE AGE (ZEITGEIST)English-language authors, when referring to the discovery of the firstpsychopharmaceuticals, often state that ‘serendipity’ was involved. Thisword, which comes from a Persian fairy tale, refers to the ability of a researchworker to make a fortuitous and unexpected discovery while leaving openupon what this ability is based. Jesteet al.(1979) have set out the etymology ofthe word and at the same time spoke against overemphasis of the element ofchance in the history of psychopharmacology. In their view, several impulseswere needed to allow the development of the most important biological(pharmacological and other) methods of modern therapy in psychiatry:.A strong individual motivation on the part of the research workers involvedand the conviction that mental illnesses could be treated by physicalmethods..The ability to make precise observations and the persistence to follow upeven unexpected results, and at the same time also the courage to extendlaboratory observations to experiments in man..TheZeitgeist– the spirit of the times in which they worked, i.e. the culturaland, in the present case, the scientific views prevailing at a specific time andin a specific society..The availability of basic knowledge from several related disciplines.48PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"At first sight we are quite willing to accept the importance of all four factorsstated by Jesteet al., but closer consideration raises several questions. There isno doubt that the discoverers of lithium, chlorpromazine, imipramine, etc.(Cade, Deniker, Kuhn) were highly motivated investigators and doctors, butthere were also many highly motivated investigators at other times inpsychiatry who were ready and able to check laboratory observations inclinical trials. The first two points put forward by Jesteet al.(1979) are thusquite non-specific. What characterized the scientificZeitgeistof the late 1940sand how did this differ from that of the 1920s and 1930s? The question cannotbe answered in this general form, but in the case of psychiatry it should beremembered that many physical and pharmacological methods of therapy hadbeen introduced in earlier times without leading to the discovery ofchlorpromazine, and the idea that mental illnesses could be caused orpromoted by physical factors is a very old concept. What was decisive herewas rather the circumstance that several pharmaceutical companies had startedresearch and development programs after the Second World War, which,although aimed in different directions, resulted in pharmacologically active andrelatively well-tolerated compounds that could be clinically tested for various,sometimes even speculative, indications.The fourth point in the analysis by Jesteet al.(basic knowledge from allieddisciplines) is also unconvincing. Did the improvement in basic knowledgereally make a decisive contribution? Lithium was already known and inmedical use in the nineteenth century, without its antimanic properties andprophylactic effect in depression being discovered. The synthesis of thechemical structures of phenothiazine and iminodibenzyl, from which chlor-promazine and imipramine, respectively, were developed, had also been knownsince the nineteenth century (Caldwell, 1978; Broadhurst, 1998) and althoughthe benzodiazepine structure was new it was by no means so complicated that itcould not have been synthesized far earlier. Finally, the pharmacologicalmethods used to characterize the compounds in the laboratory were not basedon newly acquired basic knowledge, despite the fact that the scientists atRhoˆ ne–Poulenc had to develop several new tests.It follows that newly acquired basic knowledge in psychiatry, e.g. about thebiochemistry of psychoses (which was essentially unknown around 1950),cannot have had a direct impact on the discovery of modern psychopharma-ceuticals. The neurophysiological, neurosurgical and neurochemical methodsdeveloped in the twentieth century played no part, either in the pharmacolo-gical or in the clinical characterization of lithium, chlorpromazine, imipramine,etc., and the minds of the then leading psychiatrists were directed primarily topsychoanalysis and not to the biological basis of psychiatry. On the contrary,major fresh impetus was given to neurophysiology, neuropharmacology,neurochemistry and to clinical research methodologyin the wakeof thediscovery of these psychopharmaceuticals in the 1950s and 1960s.HISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY49"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"2.5.3 QUANTITATIVE ASPECTSPossibly too little attention is paid in the historical accounts of psychophar-macology to one quantitative factor: the number of research workers in thefield of natural science who have at various times grappled with problems inpsychiatry, and the numbers of substances used on the mentally ill at variousperiods in time. Both of these figures have grown very appreciably over the last100 years, especially after the First and Second World Wars. It is probably nocoincidence that the major discoveries – the shock therapies on the one handand the psychopharmaceuticals on the other – fall within these periods. It isevident that the prospects of finding a suitable medication for an illness ofunknown pathogenic mechanism increase with the number of novel substancestested – always assuming that the pharmacological and clinical-pharmacologicalwork is properly conducted.On the other hand, quantitative viewpoints alone are not sufficient to explainthe sudden advance in the 1950s and the subsequent stagnation ofpsychopharmacology, with few new principles of action discovered in thefollowing two or three decades (Fig. 2.1). In the 1960s and 1970s the number ofresearchers involved with psychopharmacology in hospitals, universities andindustry increased considerably and an enormous number of substances weretested in the laboratory and on patients during that period, without awakeningdecisive advances in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, depression andother mental disorders.2.6. THE PAST 20 YEARSMore recent developments in psychopharmacology that are of interest includeatypical antipsychotic drugs, new antidepressants, specifically selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and drugs for the treatment ofAlzheimer’s disease.2.6.1 ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGSAfter the discovery of chlorpromazine as an antipsychotic drug many similarlyacting compounds, later called typical neuroleptics (Chapter 1), were developedand marketed. Significant therapeutic progress was made whenclozapine, thefirst atypical antipsychotic drug, was introduced in some European countries inthe years 1971/1972. Clozapine had been synthesized as early as 1959 in thelaboratories of a small Swiss drug company (Wander AG); its pharmacologicalprofile was described for the first time in January 1961 (Schmutz andEichenberger, 1983). A number of factors delayed the development of50PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"clozapine as an antipsychotic (Stille and Fischer-Cornelssen, 1988). Two openclinical studies in patients with schizophrenia were initiated in 1961/62 andproduced contradictory findings. Subsequently, a multicenter study planned inSwitzerland and Germany could not start because the amount of substanceproduced in a pilot plant was insufficient!Clozapine was also tested as a potential analgesic, but had to be abandonedfor this indication because patients were severely sedated even after small dosesof the drug. Despite increasing scepticism about the future of the compound atWander AG, clinical studies in schizophrenia were continued in 1965 on asmall scale. A first publication highlighting clozapine’s superior antipsychoticeffects appeared in an Austrian medical journal (Gross and Langner, 1966) buthad little impact. In the same year, a very positive account of the drug’s clinicalproperties was given by a distinguished team of German psychiatrists at one ofthe first psychopharmacology congresses in Washington (Lehmann and Ban,1997) – again with few immediate consequences.It took almost 10 years to collect and consolidate clinical data sufficient forthe registration of clozapine as an antipsychotic drug in Switzerland andelsewhere. Much of this delay was due to the fact that some leadingpsychiatrists of the time simply would not accept that a compound withmarked peripheral side effects and strong sedative action, but not producingextrapyramidal motor symptoms, could be an effective or even superiorantipsychotic drug. Based on clinical experience with the existing neuroleptics,there was a firm opinion that antipsychotic efficacy was tied to the propensityto cause extrapyramidal motor effects. The ‘‘strange story of clozapine’’(McKenna and Bailey, 1993) is often quoted as an example to show howstereotyped scientific assumptions can hinder medical progress.Once on the European market, clozapine rapidly gained a reputation ofbeing clinically superior to other antipsychotic drugs; however its furtherexpansion was stopped abruptly in 1974 when a rare but potentially fatalhematological side effect was detected in Finland. A number of patientsdeveloped granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis on clozapine; eight patientsdied from subsequent infections, causing an almost complete ban on the drug.Still, clozapine continued to be used in a few European countries as a lastresort for severely ill patients not responding to any of the available neurolepticdrugs. The number of publications describing clozapine’s clinical propertiesand discussing its mode of action increased steadily, causing the manufacturerof the drug to consider a re-launch of the product. In 1989, after a largecontrolled clinical study had confirmed the superiority of clozapine overconventional neuroleptics (Kaneet al., 1988), the drug was approved in theUSA and other countries for use in treatment-resistant or neuroleptic-intolerant psychotic patients.Compared with the history of clozapine, the development of the more recentatypical antipsychotics – risperidone and olanzapine – appears almostHISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY51"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"straightforward.Risperidonewas introduced in the early 1990s as the secondatypical antipsychotic drug after clozapine. Its pharmacological and clinicalprofile shows some overlap with properties of clozapine and those of typicalneuroleptics like haloperidol (Owens and Risch, 1998). The compound wassynthesized and developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals in Belgium followingan interesting clinical observation, i.e. that the serotonin 5-HT2 antagonistritanserin, when added to typical neuroleptics like haloperidol, can lead to animprovement of negative symptoms, depression and anxiety in schizophrenicpatients. The combination of haloperidol and ritanserin was also found toproduce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) than haloperidol alone.Risperidone, which is a potent blocker of central 5-HT2A receptors (likeritanserin) and dopamine D2 receptors (like haloperidol), was first tested inschizophrenic patients around 1986; as predicted from its pharmacologicalprofile, the compound turned out to be equally effective as haloperidol withregard to positive symptoms, it showed some efficacy against negativesymptoms and it caused fewer EPS than classical neuroleptics at clinicallyeffective, low doses.Olanzapine, a drug developed by Eli Lilly in England and the USA, ischemically and pharmacologically related to clozapine. It has high affinity todopamine D1, D2 and D4, serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT3, histamine H1,a1-adrenergic and muscarinic M1 receptors. The compound was selected from alarger series of chemical analogs based on behavioral tests and not, as onewould have expected at that time (in the late 1980s), onin vitrobinding andother biochemical studies. Olanzapine blocked a conditioned avoidanceresponse at lower doses than those needed to induce catalepsy in rats; thisratio was considered predictive for the relationship between antipsychotic andEPS-producing doses in patients. As stated by Tupperet al. (1999): ‘‘hadbinding studies been a primary method of selecting compounds, it is unlikelyolanzapine would have been developed’’. According to information publiclyavailable, the clinical development of olanzapine was uneventful. Registrationdocuments were submitted simultaneously to health authorities in Europe andthe USA in September 1995, with approval a year later. Together withrisperidone, olanzapine is currently the most widely prescribed antipsychoticdrug.2.6.2 NEW ANTIDEPRESSANTS: SSRIsOnce the antidepressant effect of imipramine had been recognized, a largenumber of imipramine-like compounds with no really novel features weredeveloped and marketed (Chapter 1). According to the Swedish pharmacol-ogist Arvid Carlsson (1998), the next step occurred as follows: ‘‘During the1960s the mechanism of action of imipramine was generally believed to be ablockade of norepinephrine reuptake. However, late in the same decade this52PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"picture started to change somewhat. In 1968, working with K. Fuxe and U.Ungerstedt,...Ifound that imipramine blocked not only the reuptake ofnorepinephrine but also that of serotonin. We then studied a large number oftricyclic antidepressants. Among them, clomipramine had the strongest actionon serotonin uptake, more so than did imipramine...Wethen decided to try todevelop a compound that was selective for serotonin reuptake...wesynthetized and tested zimelidine and found it to be a selective serotoninuptake inhibitor. . . the first zimelidine patent was published in 1972. Later,zimelidine was tested clinically, and in several well-controlled clinical studies itwas found to be a powerful antidepressant.’’ Unexpectedly, zimelidine caused asevere, although rare, neurological side effect and the drug company involved(Astra AB in Sweden) decided to withdraw the product from the market.At about the same time other drug companies, notably Ferrosan inDenmark, Beecham in England and Eli Lilly in the USA, had started their ownprograms to find and develop SSRIs for the treatment of depression. Drugslike fluvoxamine, paroxetine and fluoxetine reached the markets in relativelyshort sequence (in 1985) and were very successful, mainly due to their improvedtolerability and safety but also to aggressive marketing. Important new clinicalapplications of SSRIs were anxiety disorders, once it had been recognized andwidely publicized that benzodiazepines could cause tolerance and clinicallysignificant withdrawal syndromes after prolonged use.2.6.3 DRUGS TO TREATALZHEIMER’S DISEASEThe development of antidementia drugs such as donepezil (Aricept1),rivastigmine (Exelon1) and galantamine (Reminyl1) had its scientific originin neurobiochemical discoveries made some 20 years earlier; Bowenet al.(1976) and Davies and Maloney (1976) reported on a marked decrease ofcholinergic activity in the brains of patients who had died while suffering fromAlzheimer’s disease (AD). In the hippocampus – a brain structure criticallyinvolved in memory functions – and in some cerebral cortical areas of patientswith AD they noted a significant reduction in enzymes required for thesynthesis and breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. As subse-quently demonstrated by Perryet al. (1978), the cerebral cholinergicdysfunction in patients with AD was significantly correlated with the degreeof cognitive decline.The acetylcholine-deficiency hypothesis, also known ascholinergic hypothesisof AD(Bartuset al., 1982), was supplemented by a host of pharmacologicalfindings, all suggesting a close relationship between an intact cholinergicneurotransmission and cognitive functioning (for review, see Holttum andGershon, 1992). Based on this body of knowledge, several possible approachesto treat AD could be envisaged (Spiegel 1996, p. 209):HISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY53"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":".Enhancing cholinergic function in the brain by increased supply of thebiological precursors of acetylcholine, lecithin or choline, similar to thetreatment of Parkinson’s disease withL-dopa, the precursor of dopamine.This approach, which was tried in dozens of short- and long-term studies,proved to be unsuccessful (Becker and Giacobini, 1988)..Stimulation of postsynaptic cholinergic receptors with so-called cholino-mimetics, i.e. compounds that can mimic some functions of acetylcholine atcholinergic synapses. This approach, which included experimental com-pounds such as RS 86 (Wettstein and Spiegel, 1984), xanomeline (Srameketal., 1995) and AF 102B (Fischeret al., 1996), failed, possibly due to a lack ofspecificity of the molecules tested (Marin and Davis, 1998)..Administration of presynaptically active antagonists, i.e., substances thatmay trigger the synthesis and increased release of acetylcholine bypresynaptic cholinergic neurons. It appears that this approach has notbeen tested systematically yet..Inhibiting the enzymes that break down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine(so-called cholinesterases) by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors. Thisapproach, which bears some resemblance to the use of MAO inhibitors indepression (Chapter 4), turned out to be the only successful one still usedtoday.After a long series of clinical trials with inconclusive or negative results(Becker and Giacobini, 1988), the cholinesterase inhibitor approach attractednew interest following the publication of a clinical study in one of the mostprestigeous medical journals (Summerset al,1986). This paper described verypositive therapeutic findings with the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine in a groupof 17 patients, some of whom were suffering from quite advanced AD. Theresponse to tacrine was reported to last for many months in some cases andallowed the patients to continue a socially integrated and satisfactory life.Although the study was subsequently criticized for methodological short-comings and the positive findings could be confirmed only partially in bettercontrolled trials (Daviset al., 1992; Farlowet al., 1992), its impact wasgreat. Firstly, a pharmaceutical company took over the further developmentand clinical testing of tacrine and obtained a product licence (brand nameCognex1) in the USA and elsewhere. Secondly, several pharmaceuticalcompanies started searching for more effective and better tolerated cholines-terase inhibitors than tacrine, resulting in the approval and marketing ofdonepezil (1997), rivastigmine (1998) and galantamine (2000). These drugs,whose full therapeutic potential is still being explored, produce someimprovement in patients with AD having behavioral and psychiatricsymptoms: they stabilize patients at their level of cognitive and daily lifefunctioning and they may even delay progression of the disorder for one yearor more (see Chapter 7).54PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"2.7 CONCLUDING REMARKSFollowing an extended period of stagnation, the last 20 years have witnessedthe addition of several novel psychopharmaceuticals to the therapeuticarmamentarium. Examples are the new antipsychotic drugs endowed withhigher efficacy and/or partly better tolerability than conventional neuroleptics.Although these drugs do represent therapeutic progress, they are not usuallyperceived as a breakthrough in the treatment of schizophrenia comparable tothe first neuroleptic agent, chlorpromazine. Development of risperidone,olanzapine and some more recent compounds was encouraged by the almostaccidental discovery of clozapine’s superior antipsychotic effect. The drugcompanies involved also profited from advances in medicinal chemistry,pharmacology and toxicology, which facilitated preclinical drug discovery anddevelopment. It is worth mentioning, however, that neither clozapine norrisperidone or olanzapine were found and developed based on significant newinsights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying schizophrenia.Similar observations can be made with regard to the antidepressantsintroduced in the last 15 years or so. Both SSRIs and serotonin norepinephrinereuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) represent some quantitative progress from theearlier antidepressants in that they are less toxic, cause fewer medicallysignificant adverse events and support treatment compliance. As is the case forantipsychotics and schizophrenia, the development of these newer antidepres-sants was not based on fundamentally new insights into the pathophysiology ofaffective disorders.The development and introduction of the more recent antidementia drugsoccurred in a different context because effective drug treatment of dementiawas not available when the first cholinergic agents were tried in patients withAD. On the other hand, a large body of scientific findings regarding cholinergicdrugs and their impact on cognitive processes had been collected, and acoherent scientific hypothesis supported the experimental use of cholinergiccompounds in AD. Given these factors, it is perhaps surprising that almost 20years had to pass between the original descriptions of a cholinergic defect inbrains of patients with AD and the approval of the first cholinesterase inhibitorfor this indication. Having personally participated in some of these developments,I would suggest that at least three factors prevented fast progress:(1) The typically advanced age of patients with AD and their often frail healthstate, setting strict limits to clinical experimentation.(2) The small therapeutic margin of cholinergic drugs, i.e. their propensity tocause nausea, vomiting and other side effects early in treatment,necessitating slow and individualized dose escalation.(3) Our initial ignorance regarding the beneficial effects one could realisticallyexpect from cholinergic drugs in patients with AD.HISTORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY55"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"Most of the early trials with cholinergic drugs in AD were limited to a few daysor weeks, producing predominantly negative results. It took many failedstudies to realize that the test paradigm familiar in clinical psychopharmacol-ogy, i.e. placebo-controlled trials of a few weeks’ duration (Chapter 5), was notappropriate in a degenerative, progressive disorder such as AD. Researchersand clinicians will now agree that the therapeutic benefit of cholinesteraseinhibitors consists of cognitive and functional stabilization, and that controlledtrials of several months’ duration are necessary to demonstrate reliable andclinically significant effects of these drugs. Once again, it was necessary toovercome some preconceived ideas in order to reach progress in a sub-area ofpsychopharmacology.56PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"3Effects of Psychotropic Medicationon Healthy Subjects3.1 INTRODUCTIONPsychotropic medication is meant to be used therapeutically in patients withserious emotional problems, mental disorders or with deficits in neurological orcognitive functioning. What kind of useful information can one possibly expectfrom experiments on subjects who do not suffer from similar symptoms ordisorders? As will be seen in this chapter there is indeed useful informationoriginating from such studies, whose scientific objectives can be one or more ofthe following:(1)Drug-orientated. Here the interest lies primarily in the compounds beingstudied and their specific profiles of activities with regard to a variety ofpsychological and physiological parameters. It is assumed that informationcoming from studies in healthy volunteers is relevant because it allows a‘clean’ assessment of drug effects without the confounding effects of anunderlying illness. Typical questions addressed are: What profile ofactivities does a new, clinically unknown compound display in healthypersons? Does a given compound that improves learning and memory inanimal experiments display similar effects in man? Do drugs used indifferent clinical indications also show characteristic differences withregard to their effects on healthy people? – This field of investigation issometimes termedhuman pharmacology, i.e. pharmacological studiesperformed on human subjects, and investigations of this kind are oftencarried out in early phases of development of new drugs (Chapter 5).Psychopharmacology, Fourth Edition.

Interest is directed primarily to the assessmentmethods, particularly their sensitivity with regard to drug effects. Thecharacteristic effects of the substances used in these experiments arepresumed to be known, i.e. the drugs serve as readily usable and easilyquantified tools for modifying the mental state of the subjects. Someauthors use the termpharmacopsychologyto designate this type of study.(3)Understanding clinical drug effects. Here the goal is to understand thetherapeutic efficacy of a drug based on some or all of its effects seen inhealthy subjects. A typical question would be whether hypnotic drugsproduce effects in healthy people, e.g. sleepiness during daytime or deepersleep at night, which may be seen as homologous to the therapeutic actionof these drugs in patients with insomnia.(4)Theory-orientated. Some questions regarding brain–behavior relationshipsmay be approached by the application of pharmacologically well-definedsubstances to healthy volunteers. For instance, if one is interested in therelationship between brain dopaminergic function (Chapter 4) and specificaspects of attention and motivation, it may be useful to use antipsychoticdrugs or some of the psychostimulants with their known effects ondopaminergic function to affect brain dopaminergic activity and to studythe impact of these interventions on selected psychological parameters. Ofcourse, this type of study can only be performed if it is safe and ethicallyjustifiable to do so and if methods are available to assess specifically thephysiological or mental functions of interest.(5)Practice-orientated. Some drug experiments in healthy volunteers alsoserve a very practical purpose, namely to assess the effects of specific drugson everyday activities, e.g. driving a car or operating complicatedmachinery. Such studies, which are easier to perform in a controlledfashion on healthy volunteers than on psychiatric patients, are based onthe assumption that results from healthy subjects can be extrapolated tothe conditions prevailing in patients, or at least to those who haverecovered from their most severe symptoms and are still kept onmedication.A brief comment is in order regarding the ‘healthy subjects’ volunteering fordrug studies. It is usually understood that they are persons who are medicallyand mentally healthy and do not take any medicines at the time of theexperiment. Health therefore means ‘absence of a detectable illness’ andgenerally implies that the subjects have also not suffered previously from severemental disturbances. Many of the older drug experiments reported in thischapter were conducted in university laboratories and the healthy subjects weretypically students, i.e. a group that is in several ways not representative of thegeneral population. More recently drug experiments have often beenperformed at commercially directed private institutes, so-called contract58PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"research organizations (CROs), especially in the testing of new substances. Thehealthy subjects in these cases are often unemployed people, sometimes evendestitute tourists passing through the country, or pensioners, all of whom wishto improve their financial situation by participating in drug trials. The term‘healthy subjects’ can thus mean a number of different things, and attentionneeds to be paid to the subject selection criteria used in a study wheninterpreting its findings.3.2 STUDIES CONDUCTED BY EMIL KRAEPELINEarly pharmacopsychological experiments were conducted by the renownedGerman psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1892), although this area of research onlyreally began to acquire quantitative importance in the years following thediscovery of chlorpromazine (e.g. Uhr and Miller, 1964). Kraepelin’s studies‘Ueber die Beeinflussung einfacher psychischer Vorga ̈nge durch einigeArzneimittel’ (On the influence of some medical drugs on simple mentalprocesses) related in particular to the psychotropic effects of alcohol. Inaddition, Kraepelin studied the then available hypnotics paraldehyde andchloral hydrate, as well as the ‘inhalation poisons’ ether and chloroform. Thestimulants tested were caffeine and tea and some of his experiments related tomorphine. Kraepelin’s expectations were twofold. On the one hand, heregarded it as a forward step ‘‘to be able to set out, in numerical terms, thosechanges in our mental life which we could otherwise only describe in quitegeneral terms using the deceptive method of self-observation and to attributethese to certain very simple, elementary disturbances through the use ofexperimental methods’’ (1892, p. 227). On the other hand, he hoped to acquirenew knowledge for psychology, because drugs can be used to act repeatedly onnormal mental processes and thus enable one to better study their ‘true nature’.Kraepelin performed his studies under Wilhelm Wundt at the University ofLeipzig, using the objective methods newly developed in this first laboratoryof experimental psychology. Reaction time was measured as an indicator of‘mental performance in general’; reading speed was assessed with the aidof standardized printed texts, and calculation performance by means of theaddition of single-digit numbers over 5-min periods. Sequences of 12-digitnumbers had to be learnt off by heart, the number of repetitions until asequence could be recited without error being used as a measure of memoryperformance. Time-estimation trials were intended to indicate inner mentalspeed, and association experiments were used to record the speed and wealth ofverbal association processes.Apart from some technical refinements, many of the methods described byKraepelin in his 1892 monograph are still used today in psychologicalexperiments dealing with various aspects of mental performance. What hasPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS59"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"evolved substantially in the intervening period is the experimental design andset-up of such studies. Kraepelin’s trials were mostly conducted in the eveningsbecause he himself and some of his colleagues served as test persons at the endof their normal working day. Kraepelin was often his own experimenter and inall cases the subjects knew what dosage of which substance they were taking.Repeated blank trials (without medication) were run in order to obtainreference values, yet no-substance and active-ingredient days were notbalanced, and the use of a placebo for experimental purposes was unknown.Kraepelin ensured that no subject consumed tea, coffee or alcohol for 5–6 hpreceding a trial and saw that the last meal was taken 2–3 h before anexperiment commenced. What he could not prevent, however, was that manyof the trials took place under unfavorable circumstances; his subjects and hehimself were occasionally overtired or indisposed for other reasons, which mayexplain why one repeatedly reads references to the difficulty of establishing thedrug effects over and above spontaneous fluctuations. A further obviousdifference in comparison to present-day experiments is the absence of formalstatistical comparisons; Kraepelin confined himself to the presentation of meanor median values and to descriptive comparisons between treatment condi-tions. Tests of significance and statistical test procedures in the present-daysense were unknown at the end of the nineteenth century.Despite many shortcomings in trial design and execution, the resultsreported by Kraepelin are interesting:.After 30–50 g ofalcohol(consumed as 70–110 ml of cognac or whisky or250–400 ml of wine) a biphasic action was observed. Some 30–45 min afterthe alcohol had been ingested, simpler mental activities such as reading andspeed of simple reactions were often improved but there was no change inthe more difficult tasks. Later on, i.e. more than 45 min after intake,performance was in general reduced, particularly for higher doses of alcoholand more complex activities (choice reaction times, wealth of wordassociations)..After 3–5 g of the hypnoticparaldehydea qualitatively similar pattern ofaction was observed as with alcohol, although the stimulation phase wasbriefer and less pronounced and the ‘paralysing’ action of the preparationwas stronger. Following the intake ofchloral hydrateand with theinhalation poisons the paralysing effect was still more pronounced..Only very few experiments were conducted usingmorphine(10 mgsubcutaneously) owing to poor tolerability, and no conclusions could bedrawn..Following 500 mg ofcaffeineand after tea (10 g of yellow China and blackEast Indian tea, allowed to infuse for 5 min), improved performance wasobserved in a number of areas: an increase in the number of additions in the60PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"arithmetic test and in the number of word associations but not in theinventiveness of the words produced.In the ‘Summary of the results’, which he formulated with great caution,Kraepelin made the following comments:(1) He was ‘‘very gratified’’ to note that ‘‘the results of our studies show thateach of the substances discussed herein exert an entirely characteristiceffect on our spiritual life’’ (p. 228).(2) His ‘‘aim was exclusively to develop methods for a precise determination ofthe actions of drugs on the mind, and to demonstrate the possibility oftheir practical application and the utility of their results in selectedexamples’’ (pp. 229–230). This aim was achieved, even though somequestions could not be answered definitively, such as that concerning‘individual differences’ in response to drugs.(3) It was possible to link the results achieved experimentally with everydayexperience, e.g. in the use of alcohol, and to gain a better understanding ofthe mode of action of the substances used.Whereas the care devoted by Kraepelin to the individual assessment methodswas in some contrast to the more loosely handled experimental design andconditions, great importance nowadays is laid on details of design andstatistical analysis of human pharmacological studies. The most importantelements in the organization of such trials are:.Selection of subjects commensurate with the purpose of the study..Consideration of the constitution and disposition of the subjects: age,gender, body weight; health condition during preceding days; medicationtaken in the last 2 weeks; sleep during the preceding night..Standardization of experimental conditions: time of day; personnel incharge..Balanced administration of test substances and placebo..Blinding of the subjects and experimenters with regard to treatment givenon a particular day..Use of statistical methods appropriate to the data level.The studies reported and discussed in the following sections of Chapter 3considered most or all of these methodological issues.3.3 ASSESSMENT METHODS USED IN DRUGEXPERIMENTS ON HEALTHY VOLUNTEERSPsychotropic drugs exert effects that are usually noticed by the subject and inprinciple can be described in words – these are termedsubjective effects.InPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS61"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"addition, effects are produced that may be noted by an observer – a subjectappears to slow down, his performance deteriorates, his thoughts seem towander; such changes – termedbehavioral effects– can be assessed usingmethods known in neuropsychology. Psychotropic drugs may also producechanges in brain electrical and chemical activity, which can be recorded bymeans of appropriate technology; these will be summarized under the headingofneurophysiological effects.3.3.1 METHODS FOR RECORDING SUBJECTIVE DRUG EFFECTSThe method that appears to be the simplest for recording subjective drug effectsis to ask a subject how he feels before a substance is given and then to repeatthe question at suitable times after the drug has been ingested. This approachallows the subject to describe his current condition in his own words. Theexperimenter then can ask some specific questions designed to help a subject tocompare his current state with his state before ingestion of the drug. Based onthesefree descriptions, one can record individually perceived, and qualitativelypossibly very differentiated, subjective drug effects. The problems posed by thisapproach lie in the semantic and metric areas: what is the meaning of suchremarks as ‘‘I feel all closed up’’ or ‘‘It is like being behind a smoke-screen’’ tothe individual subject? What do they mean to the investigator and how can onecollate and quantify such individual declarations into standardized terms anddimensions?A more standardized method for determining subjective drug effects is thatofstructured questioning: here, the subject is asked specific questions as to hismood, state of wakefulness and physical freshness or any other aspects ofhis condition of interest in the context of a study, and should then quantify hisanswers wherever possible into ‘somewhat’, ‘slight’, ‘of medium intensity’, etc.An advantage of this procedure is that ambiguous answers can be clarifiedimmediately by further questioning; a disadvantage is that the experimenterloses much time (and may get bored) in trials with larger groups of subjects andseveral repetitions on the same test day. Moreover, the experimenter’squestions may be unduly influenced by his personal impressions of the realor presumed state of the subject.For reasons of expediency and objectivity, and particularly in the case ofmore extensive studies, questions are preferably submitted in writing, i.e. insome form ofself-rating scale. Here one can distinguish between symptomchecklists, adjective checklists, semantic differentials and visual analog scales.Symptom checklistsare often formulated as alternatives, i.e. the subject isasked whether or not he is experiencing a symptom, e.g. headache, at a givenpoint in time. The list of symptoms presented to subjects can either be compiledon the basis of previous knowledge of the substances being tested, or astandardized list can be used. Symptom checklists may also be formulated in62PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"grades, i.e. the subject is asked if a given symptom is absent, mild, moderate,severe or intolerable. An example of this format is the Revised 90-ItemSymptom Check List (SCL-90-R;ECDEU Assessment Manual, 1976). There isno general rule as to which procedure is preferable, but short lists are best ifseveral evaluations are to be made on the same test day.Adjective checklistscan be formulated as alternatives or in grades. In bothcases the subjects seek to describe their current subjective state by means ofPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS63Figure 3.1Example of a semantic differential"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"predetermined adjectives. Well-known instruments for use in English-speakingcountries are the Clyde Mood Scale (Clyde, 1963) and the POMS (Profile ofMood States; seeECDEU Assessment Manual, 1976). Adjective checklists canbe arranged in the format ofsemantic differentials(Fig. 3.1) and subjects arerequired to check one of the boxes placed between two extreme terms andcorresponding best to their current state. Visual analog scales(VAS; Fig. 3.2)have become very popular and can be adapted individually to suit specificquestions. These enable a subject to pinpoint his current condition somewherealong a 10 cm line, the ends of which usually denote extreme states (Bond andLader, 1974; Maxwell, 1978).In general, standardization of questionnaires and their items helps tosimplify quantitative comparisons between individuals and conditions butsimultaneously curtails each individual statement and may force it intoinappropriate categories. Moreover, allocating the same weight to all the itemsin a questionnaire, such as all pairs of opposite terms in a semantic differential,may iron out the effects of substances and obscure interesting individual effects.A freely formulated description of drug action, be it in oral or written form,should therefore be included in studies of this kind.3.3.2 METHODS FOR RECORDING BEHAVIORAL DRUG EFFECTSIn principle any form of human activity capable of being observed andrecorded objectively and reliably can serve as a basis for assessing the effect ofpsychotropic drugs. Behavior in social situations (e.g. in small groups),behavior in situations where a specific performance is required and behavior attimes of relaxation or pleasure all vary according to the degree of wakefulnessand state of motivation of an individual and could provide valuableopportunities for observations of drug effects. Review of the literatureshows, however, that almost all studies published in the last 20 years focuson performance-related behavior and that there have been very few studies ofdrug effects on social behavior and virtually none of drug effects on behaviorduring relaxation and pleasure. This one-sidedness may be a result of thedifficulty in creating standardized, relevant and ethically acceptable situationsin which specific forms of social behavior can be studied. It should be noted,64PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 3.2Example of a visual analog scale"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"however, that older ‘sociopharmacological’ studies summarized by McGuireetal.(1982) provided only minimal insights into relevant drug effects.In the following paragraphs the emphasis has consequently been laid onstudies using a variety ofperformance tests. There are many ways to classifysuch methods, e.g. by the specific mental function a task is thought to tap orsimply by test duration. Similar to a classification used by Deutsch Lezak(1995) for neuropsychological tests, we will distinguish the following areas ofmental performance:.attention and concentration.perception.learning and memory.verbal functions and language skills.concept formation and reasoning.motor performance and executive functionsThere are no sharp borderlines between some of these areas of mentalperformance (elements of attention, perception and some motor function areinvolved in all forms of performance), and allocation to a specific area isdebatable for many tests. When studies are planned in practice this will beconsidered by compiling a battery of tests containing some redundancy whilestill retaining parameters from various areas of performance.Attention and ConcentrationNo special abilities such as verbal intelligence or motor dexterity are usuallyneeded to perform tests of attention and concentration. Popular methodsinclude cancellation and coding tests, simple arithmetical tasks and tasksdesigned to assess vigilance (Table 3.1). Tests of attention and concentrationnot only differ with regard to the nature and difficulty of the tasks to beperformed, but also in respect of their duration. Thus, most cancellation taskslast only a few minutes but vigilance tests usually take longer, in extreme casessuch as the Mackworth Clock (Mackworth, 1965) up to 1 h. By using longerlasting tests it is possible to measure fluctuations of performance in time,although long-lasting tests cannot be repeated more than two or three times onthe same experimental day.PerceptionThe term perception designates physiological and mental processes that serveto absorb and classify information from our internal and external environ-ments. Speed, extent and quality of perception not only depend on thecondition of the sensory organs but they are also a function of such factors aswakefulness, attentiveness or concentration, emotional and motivational statePSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS65"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"and short-term memory. A distinction may be made between procedures forthe determination of:.thresholds of perception.speed of perception.extent of perception.qualitative characteristics of perceptionOnly a small proportion of the methods available, mainly for diagnosticpurposes (Lezak, 1995, p. 385), have been used in drug experiments. Specialmention should be made of the determination ofcritical flicker fusion frequency(CFF) and of tachistoscopic trials, i.e. of methods directed at thecharacteristics of visual perception. In contrast, drug effects on hearing haverarely, and those influencing senses of touch, smell and taste have hardly ever,been investigated (Turner, 1971).In studies of CFF the frequency of a discontinuous (flickering) light source isincreased until the subject reports seeing a continuous light. The correspondingfrequency is termed the CFF, measured in cycles per second (cps) or hertz (Hz).Another procedure, which is usually combined with the first, consists ofgradually reducing the frequency of a light source until that threshold is66PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 3 .1Typical tests of attention and concentration (for details see Deutsch Lezak,1995, p. 352)AssessmentTest proceduresDurationShort-termattention,concentration.Cancellation tests: picking out andmarking numbers, letters and geometricshapes according to a given criterionA few minutes.Digit symbol substitution tests (DSST):allocation of given symbols to numbers.Contains short-term memory compo-nentA few minutes.Calculation tests of different complexityand duration.

The CFF isthought to reflect ‘‘cortical function and more specifically may reflect occipital/parietal lobe activity’’ (Curran and Wattis, 1998), although the underlyingneuronal mechanisms are poorly understood. Interpretation of CFF findingsmay be complicated if drugs affect pupil diameter, as is the case for manypsychotropic compounds (Schmittet al., 2002).Tachistoscopic trialsserve to record speed and extent of perception. In thecourse of such experiments visual stimuli are shown for a very short time andthe subject has to name the items presented as far as he has recognized them.Tests with simple configurations of stimuli (colors, single letters or objects)primarily record speed of perception, whereas experiments with more variedcontent also investigate elements of short-term memory. Tachistoscopicexperiments are nowadays hardly used in pharmacopsychology, presumablybecause of their low sensitivity to the effects of substances.Learning and MemoryThe processes of learning and remembering can be broken down into stagesthat follow each other in time: information intake (registration), processing(encoding), storage and retention and retrieval (reproduction). In addition, adivision into memory files or ‘stores’ has been proposed, involving, dependingon the author, two or more components: ultrashort-term, short-term and long-term stores are constructs that can be operationalized and quantifiedexperimentally. The concept of a ‘working memory’ (Baddeley, 1986) alsocomprises a short-term storage and a number of executive processes thatoperate on the transiently stored material.Regardless of the specific model of memory used, the time at which apharmacological agent is administered and develops its action is crucial(Fig. 3.3):(1) If a drug is administered before the material to be learned is presented, i.e.before the registration phase, its effects on wakefulness, alertness andmotivation of the subject are obviously confounded with a possible specificaction on learning, i.e. on the processes linked with registration andencoding. It is therefore to be expected that stimulant substancesadministered at low doses before the registration phase will show a‘memory-promoting’ effect as a result of their action on attentiveness,whereas sedative compounds will have the opposite effect.(2) Drugs can be administeredafter the registration phasewith the purpose ofstudying their action on encoding processes. Trials of this type in humansare difficult to interpret, mainly because encoding processes of varioustypes and levels may last for seconds, minutes or hours, whereas the time atPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS67"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"which a drug reaches and affects the relevant brain structures cannot becontrolled precisely.(3) Drugs can be administeredafter the completion of the encoding processes,i.e. at a time when the acquired information is thought to be stored in long-term memory. A drug may then counteract or promote the spontaneousdecay of previously learned information. This is a particularly interestingquestion in cases of long-term drug administration, which is typical for thetherapeutic use of most medications.(4) A drug may be administered when a subject tries to remember previouslylearned material, i.e.before the reproduction phase, in order to study itsaction on the retrieval of stored information. Also in this case, the effect ofa substance on wakefulness, motivation, etc. may be confounded with apossible specific drug effect on retrieval.Another area of interest are studies on so-calledstate-dependent learning andmemory, i.e. the registration and retrieval of information occurring under thesame or different drug treatment conditions. This constitutes a special case ofcontext-dependent learning and memory because it concerns the question ofwhether information acquired under the influence of a drug (case (1) above)can be retrieved better or worse when this same substance or placebo isadministered before the retrieval phase (case (4)).Studies of drug action on learning and memory are attractive in severalrespects, yet they make particularly great demands on the planning andinterpretation of a trial. This is the case particularly for cases (2) and (3),whereas case (1) is relatively straightforward. Some well-known test methodsfor learning and memory are summarized in Table 3.2, only a few of which areregularly used in pharmacopsychology (e.g. digit span, word list learning andpaired associate learning tests).68PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 3.3Possible timing of drug administration during the learning and memoryprocess"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Verbal Functions and Language SkillsVocabulary and word fluency tests provide subjects with an initial letter forwhich they should name as many nouns as possible, or they are asked to nameas many four-legged animals as possible within a given time limit. Other taskstend rather to call for logical thinking, such as finding communalities,similarities and exceptions within a series of words. Several equivalent parallelforms of these tasks must be available if the same subject needs to be testedmore than once or a few times on the same day.Concept Formation and ReasoningAlthough of great value in functional psychodiagnostics, tests of conceptformation and reasoning, such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST),are only little used in drug experiments with healthy volunteers. This isprobably due to their complex administration and interpretation. In contrast,the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) from the Wechsler AdultIntelligence Scale (WAIS), which some include in the category of conceptformation tasks, has been used in many studies; this is mainly due to its brevityand to the fact that one can easily devise parallel forms.

A comprehensiveaccount of the methods available is given in Kunsmanet al.(1992) andDeutsch Lezak (1995, chapter 16). Some of these tasks are subject to apronounced practice effect and, if repeated several times by the same subject,turn into tests of attention and concentration rather than of motorperformance.Executive functions can be sub-classified into volition, planning, purposiveaction and effective performance. Volition, ‘‘this most subtle and central realmof human activity’’ (Deutsch Lezak, 1995, p. 651), is not usually assessed indrug experiments. Typical tests to assess planning are mazes of differentcomplexity and brain teasers such as the Tower of London or Hanoi. Indrug experiments with healthy volunteers, purposive action and effectiveperformance are usually measured by means of the methods listed in Tables 3.1and 3.3.3.3.3 NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERSPsychotropic drugs exert their intended actions on the brain, and it is thereforelogical to study brain functions as directly as possible in order to understandthe actions of these substances. The possibilities for studying drug effectsin situin the human brain are limited because: so-called invasive techniques used inanimal studies (removal of tissues, insertion of electrodes or cannulas into thebrain) cannot be considered for research purposes in humans, and the newernon-invasive procedures such as positron emission tomography (PET) andfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have their own limitations (seeChapter 6). For these reasons some of the neurophysiological techniquesdeveloped several decades ago are still in use today.Theelectroencephalogram(EEG), first described by H. Berger in the late1920s, makes it possible to record electrical correlates of brain activity inhuman subjects in a non-invasive manner. The EEG patterns alter in relationto the degree of wakefulness, and drugs such as cocaine, scopolamine andchloroform were already used by Berger (1931) in order to manipulate the‘‘degree of consciousness’’ of his subjects and to investigate the electricalcorrelates of the conditions brought about. Computerized procedures toevaluate EEGs quantitatively arose in the 1960s, allowing longer EEG traces tobe analyzed more easily and objectively and thus permitting more extensive70PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"pharmacological investigations. Experiments of this type, involving wakingsubjects and the administration of drugs, are termedpharmaco-EEGstudies.The 1960s also saw the rapid growth of psychophysiological sleep research.It was noticed that psychotropic drugs not only affect the pattern of wakeEEGs but also alter the electrophysiological correlates of the sleep state, asrecorded insleep polygramsorhypnograms. Thus it became possible to studythe actions of drugs on the brain over a broad range of vigilance states fromdeep sleep to the active waking state. At about the same time investigatorsstarted to examine the effects of drugs onevoked potentials(EPs), i.e. theelectrical correlates of brain responses to sensory stimuli. As is the case forthe EEG in wake and sleep states, EPs can be recorded from the surface of theskull and provide information on the functional state of the brain in responseto standardized tactile, visual or auditory stimulation.Recordings of the wake EEG, sleep polygram and EPs are all based on theprinciple of sampling, amplifying and filtering the changes in electricalpotential arising on the cranial surface as indicators of brain activity. Inspite of some technical similarities, the three approaches differ very much withregard to time-related and other characteristics, thus allowing the study ofdifferent aspects of a drug’s effect in the brain. All three approaches offerseveral advantages that still support their use in human psychopharmacology:PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS71Table 3 . 3Methods for testing motor performance and executive functionProcedureActivity requiredUsual durationDynamometerPressing a handle, etc. repeatedly againstresistance15–60 sTappingTapping on a pad as quickly as possible30–60 sAimingPlacing a dot, the beam of a light pen, etc.into circles or squares arranged invarious patternsA few minutesPeg boardInserting pegs into rows of holes in a boardSaccadic eyemovementsFast conjugate eye movements, e.g. whenreading or following moving objectsA few minutesVisual pursuit,trackingTracking a regularly or irregularly movinglight spot with the eyes; or, using alight-pen, following a point describingsimple or complex trajectories on ascreenUp to 5 minReaction timeMotor reaction to simple or complexacoustic or optical stimuli (complexreaction time tasks are alsosubsumed under tests of attentionand concentration)2–10 minCar driving, flightsimulatorAppropriate reaction to and behavior insimulated road or air traffic situations10–30 min"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"(1) The recordings are non-invasive and inconvenience the subject onlyslightly, mostly in the beginning or not at all.(2) Once the subjects have become adapted to ‘being wired’, the recordings areusually very stable.(3) Recordings require no special attention or effort on the part of a subjectand consequently do not alter the processes they are designed to study(some EP paradigms are an exception in this respect; see below).(4) Recordings can be made while subjects are engaged in other activities, andit is then possible to relate aspects of the ongoing performance and thesubjective state to neurophysiological parameters.(5) The EEG recordings can in principle be continued over hours, days andeven weeks, particularly when telemetric instrumentation is available.Pharmaco-EEGMost techniques used to analyze pharmaco-EEGs are based on the averagingof a number of artefact-free recordings, assuming that a subject’s state ofvigilance does not change significantly during the time interval studied, whichis usually a few minutes. The EEG signals recorded are characterized by theirfrequency (measured in cps or Hz) and amplitude (in microvolts,mV).Pharmaco-EEG studies make use of the classification and interpretation ofEEG waves by their frequency that was introduced by Berger and hissuccessors (Table 3.4). So-called topographic EEGs, also termed EEG- orbrain-mapping procedures, are concerned with the distribution of EEGfrequency components over the entire cranial surface and not just at individuallead points. Such EEG mapping is used in some centers for diagnostic purposes(Szelies, 1992; Johnet al., 1994) but applications in pharmacopsychology havenot become widespread.Historically, and in the context of psychopharmacology, Bente (1961)assumed that there are ‘regular correlations’ between the changes occurring inthe EEG of healthy subjects after a single dose of psychotropic drugs andthose occurring in patients under therapeutic conditions. Fink (1981), Itil(1981) and other authors subsequently published a number of studiesconcerning the classification of psychotropic drugs on the basis ofquantitative EEG criteria. Much of this work was based on two hypotheses:(1) the differential therapeutic effects of antipsychotics, antidepressants,anxiolytics, etc. are also expressed in the form of differential EEG effects inpatients as well as in healthy persons; (2) it must therefore be possible toallocate new and clinically as yet unknown substances tentatively to atherapeutic class on the basis of their EEG effect in healthy subjects, and thento confirm this allocation in clinical trials.72PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Polygraphic Sleep StudiesSleep polygrams, i.e. simultaneous recordings of the EEG, eye movements(electro-oculogram, EOG) and the activity of representative muscles(electromyogram, EMG), are performed through entire nights and areclassified, via visual inspection or computerized analysis, into so-called sleepstages. The sleep of man and of many species of animal is a cyclical process,the individual segments (sleep stages) of which follow a regular sequence intime (Fig. 3.4).The relationships between the stages of sleep and its subjective aspects, suchas the feeling of depth of sleep, the state of recovery and mood in the followingmorning, have been investigated in hundreds of studies without fully clarifyingthe biological and psychological relevance of sleep and its stages. It is generallyagreed that the duration of slow-wave sleep in a given person is mainly afunction of the prior time spent awake: the longer a person has been awake, thegreater is the slow-wave sleep fraction of total sleep time in a subsequent nightof undisturbed sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep designates periodicallyappearing phases of 10–40 min duration, characterized by fast and large eyemovement recorded in the EOG and generally accompanied by dreams(although dreams also occur in other sleep segments, primarily in stages 1and 2).Ian Oswald is to be considered a pioneer in this field of research, havingtaken up sleep polygraphic investigations of the action of barbiturates,amphetamines, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and other substances in theearly 1960s (Oswald, 1968).

The nakedeye is hardly able to detect EPs individually in the wake EEG because they areconcealed by spontaneous EEG waves with higher amplitudes. Evokedpotentials are made visible by repeatedly presenting the same standardizedstimuli and then mathematically averaging the respective EEG segments. Inthis manner it is possible to ‘average out’ spontaneous EEG activity, and theEP, the amplitude of which lies between 5 and 30mV, emerges. Evokedpotentials consist of several components: in the case of visual EPs (Fig. 3.5)and similarly for EPs of other sensory modalities, a distinction is made betweena primary response, i.e. changes in potential that appear with particular clarityabove those parts of the cortex onto which the stimulus in question isprojected, and secondary responses, which may be observed somewhat laterand are presumably phenomena linked to the associative or cognitive74PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 3.4Schematic representation (hypnogram) of the course of sleep.

Primaryresponses (also termed stimulus-correlated potentials) with a latency of up toabout 100 ms depend largely on the objective, physical features of the stimuliused. Secondary responses (also called event-related potentials, ERPs) dependprimarily on the mental disposition of the subjects, i.e. their expectations andalertness at the time of the experiment.Evoked potentials with latencies below 100 ms are used clinically forfunctional testing of the optic, auditory and various somatosensory nervepathways; they are not influenced by factors such as motivation and tiredness,including drug-induced changes of alertness, and are considered to beuninteresting for psychological questions.The situation is different with EPs having longer latencies, especially wavesN200 and P300. The (negative) N200 wave (also called N2) appears about200 ms after a suitable stimulus, and the (positive) P300 wave (also called P3)appears after about 300 ms on average. Both N2 and P3 can be elicited in so-called odd-ball (two-stimuli differentiation) paradigms: the subject is presentedwith a sequence of frequent and rare stimuli, e.g. frequent high tones and rarelow tones, and is given the task of observing and counting only the rare stimuli.Both N2 and P3 arise after the noted rare stimuli; their amplitude depends onthe stimulus probability and the relevance of the stimulus in the experiment.Wave P3 can also be induced by creating an expectancy in the subjects that isPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS75Figure 3.5Classification of the components of visually evoked potentials (VEPs).

This is a very late potential fluctuation inthe parietal region that arises when a subject participating in a reaction timeexperiment is advised, through a warning stimulus, of the imminence ofanother stimulus to which he or she has to respond.Historically, Saletu (1976) performed a series of EP experiments in healthysubjects to study the action of several antipsychotics, antidepressants,anxiolytics and psychostimulants. Similar to Fink and Itil for the pharmaco-EEG, he reported on systematic, drug-type-related changes in EP latenciesafter somatosensory stimulation of his subjects.3.4 FINDINGS IN DRUG EXPERIMENTS ON HEALTHYVOLUNTEERSThe following paragraphs, which are organized by drug classes, providesummaries of numerous, with few exceptions placebo-controlled, double-blindexperiments with psychotropic drugs in healthy subjects. The number ofpublished studies in this area is huge and only a small selection of references,some of them in German or French, plus a number of ‘classical’ studies andreview articles dealing with early work will be given. References to studiesbefore 1995 will be found in Chapters 3 and 4 of previous editions of thecurrent book (Spiegel and Aebi, 1983; Spiegel, 1989, 1996).3.4.1 ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS (Table 3.5)Subjective EffectsTwo early publications (Delayet al., 1959; Di Mascioet al., 1963) deal with thesubjective effectsof the first antipsychotics in relatively high doses.Chlorpromazine at single doses of 100–200 mg gave rise to the followingeffects in healthy volunteers:.pronounced tiredness, wish to sleep, but no pleasant relaxed feeling.slower and confused thinking, difficulties in concentrating, feelings ofclumsiness.dejection, anxiety, irritabilityDryness of the mouth, visual disturbances, sweating and similar peripheraleffects were also experienced by the subjects after single doses of 50 mg or moreof chlorpromazine and contributed to a subjectively quite disagreeable state.Lower doses (12.5 and 25 mg) lead to milder sedation and fewer peripheral76PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"effects.

Single and repeated doses of 3 mg ofolanzapine given to healthy elderly volunteers resulted in reduced self-ratedalertness on day 1, with some attenuation of the effect on day 4 (Beuzenet al.,1999). Amisulpride was found to be free of subjective effects in healthy youngvolunteers at single and repeated doses of 50 and 400 mg (Ramaekerset al.,1999), and 50 as well as 200 mg of this compound did not produce anymeasurable subjective changes in a group of elderly healthy volunteers(Legangneuxet al., 2000).Behavioral EffectsWhereas the effects of chlorpromazine on various areas of performance havebeen studied thoroughly and over a wide dosage range, only fragmentaryresults are available for other antipsychotics. At single doses of 50 mg or more,chlorpromazine may cause a drop in performance in several areas (attention/concentration, perception, motor performance), whereas learning and memoryfunctions were not significantly affected up to 50 mg. Less sedativeantipsychotics such as flupenthixol, haloperidol, perphenazine or trifluoper-azine reduced performance in individual tests but did not display a uniformpattern of activity at relatively low single doses. In one study in elderly subjects3 mg of haloperidol produced a late-appearing cognitive impairment (Beuzenet al., 1999). Rather high doses of haloperidol (up to 6 mg) impair performanceon the DSST and reduce peak saccadic velocity; in contrast, performance onthe CPT was not significantly affected (Lynchet al., 1997). Sulpiride at singledoses of 300 mg was found to decrease CFF and to prolong choice reactiondecision times, although time estimations and choice reaction movement timeswere unaffected (Meyer-Lindenberget al., 1997).A significant decrease of CFF was noted after 50 mg of clozapine; sedationafter this dose was so strong that some subjects fell asleep during the study(Pretoriuset al., 2001). Single and repeated doses of 3 mg of olanzapineproduced detectable impairment in all areas of cognitive and psychomotorperformance assessed in a group of healthy elderly volunteers (Beuzenet al.,1999); the impairment was very much attenuated but still noticeable on day 4of drug administration. Amisulpride at a dose of 50 mg had no significantimpact on any performance parameter assessed in a study by Ramaekerset al.(1999); however, 400 mg of the compound was found to have negative effectson some psychomotor and cognitive measures of performance on day 5 but noton day 1 of drug administration. In the healthy elderly volunteers studied byLegangneuxet al. (2000) neither 50 nor 200 mg of amisulpride was associatedwith any signs of cognitive impairment.78PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"NeurophysiologyChlorpromazine and clozapine at low doses lead to an increase in slow (delta,theta) waves and a decrease in alpha activity in thepharmaco-EEGof healthysubjects. Findings regarding beta activity are less uniform. Rohloffet al.(1992)reported on an increase in slow frequency components and a decrease of alpha andbeta activity after 4.0mg of haloperidol. Low doses of amisulpride (up to 50mg)were reported to display an ‘alertness-enhancing’ effect (Rosenzweiget al., 2002).There are no striking effects onsleep polygramsof healthy subjects after theintake of low doses of antipsychotic drugs shortly before sleep onset: sedativedrugs such as chlorpromazine and clozapine stabilize sleep, i.e. there is less waketime after sleep onset (WASO in Table 3.5) and there are fewer briefinterruptions in the course of sleep (unrest in Table 3.5); in larger doses thesedrugs may prolong the duration of sleep. Haloperidol and pimozide areunremarkable with regard to their effects on sleep. The effects of antipsychoticson REM sleep are not uniform, and the impact upon other sleep stages is slight.Only isolated reports on the effects of antipsychotic drugs on EPs haveappeared in the literature: an early study by Saletu (1976) describing prolongedlatencies to primary and secondary responses after several neuroleptics was notreproduced by other authors. Sulpiride at doses of 150 and 300 mg inducedincreases of P200 and P300 latencies (de Visseret al., 2001). Contingentnegative variation amplitudes were found to be attenuated after 50 mg ofchlorpromazine (Tecceet al., 1978). It appears that there are no studies withneurophysiological techniques dealing with the newer atypical antipsychotics.3.4.2 ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS (Table 3.6)Subjective EffectsAmitriptyline was reported to have a calming action at doses of 6.25 and12.5 mg, whereas drowsiness is usually experienced by healthy volunteers atsomewhat higher doses (25 mg and above). Various authors have described asleep-inducing effect with single doses of over 25 mg of imipramine; at yethigher doses a subjectively unpleasant state of sedation and lethargy,sometimes accompanied by dullness and confusion and associated withpronounced vegetative symptoms, occurs. Some of the older antidepressants,which are more markedly sedating in clinical use (dothiepin, maprotiline,mianserin, trimipramine), were found to induce tiredness or drowsiness inhealthy subjects at doses considerably below those used in depressed patients.Reports are on hand relating to more recent antidepressants such asbupropion, citalopram (Fairweatheret al., 1997), fluoxetine (Gelfinet al.,1998), moclobemide (Dingemanseet al., 1998) and paroxetine (Braueret al.,1995).

Curran andWattis (1998) reviewed CFF findings for 20 different antidepressants: eightwere reported to decrease, five to increase and seven to have no effect on CFF.Some caution is required in the interpretation of these findings because manyantidepressants, e.g. the SSRIs citalopram and sertraline, induce an increase inpupil size and may then mask actual decreases of CFF (Schmittet al., 2002).The ‘natural antidepressant’ hypericum perforatum is reported to have onlyfew effects on cognitive and psychomotor performance in healthy volunteers:after single doses of 900 and 1800 mg only one test (DSST) within a largebattery was significantly affected (Timoshankoet al., 2001). The effects ofsingle doses of lithium on healthy volunteers are small. This also holds truewhen the substance is given over a period of several weeks.NeurophysiologyAmitriptyline, imipramine and mianserin were found to cause an increase indelta and theta and a decrease in the alpha bands, indicative of their sedativeproperties, inpharmaco-EEGstudies. An increase in beta power around 20 Hzalso seems to be typical for these older antidepressants. Variable effects ofdifferent antidepressants have been reported for yet faster EEG frequencies;these may be due to methodological differences between studies. Little or noeffect on EEG frequencies was seen after bupropion and viloxazine, and findingsreported for fluvoxamine are controversial: Curran and Lader (1986) noted nochanges in quantified EEG parameters after 50 mg; Nishimuraet al. (1996)observed an increase of slow and fast as well as a reduction of alpha waves afterthe same dose of fluvoxamine. Taking all reported data together, a commonpharmaco-EEG pattern does not seem to exist for antidepressant drugs fromdifferent pharmacological classes. Lithium at single doses had no significanteffects on quantified EEG parameters; after repeated administration for 2 weekssome increase in slow waves at the expense of alpha waves was detected.Polygraphic sleep studieswith antidepressants have traditionally been ofgreat interest since certain forms of depression are characterized by commonfeatures in the sleep polygram (very short REM sleep latency, i.e. time untilappearance of first REM phase; frequent sleep interruptions) and it was foundthat many antidepressants affect the sleep pattern of healthy subjects in theopposite way to that observed in endogenous depression (Vogelet al., 1990).Typically, many antidepressants lead to a dose-dependent prolongation ofREM latency and an overall reduction in the duration of REM sleep.

In studies by Tomotakeet al. (1997), Hananoet al.(1997) and Matsuokaet al. (1997), clomipramine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg wasreported to have no effect on early and middle AEP and VEP latencies, but toshorten P2 and N2 SEP latencies. Mianserin at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg was foundto prolong P3 latencies of the auditory, sensory and visually evoked potentials(AEP, SEP and VEP); late AEP and SEP latencies were also increased. Theauthors interpret their findings as being indicative of the stronger sedativeeffect of mianserin. Van Laaret al. (2002) performed an extensive study withamitriptyline (25 plus 50 mg/day), nefazodone (200 mg twice a day) andparoxetine (30 mg/day): amitriptyline had thorough effects on a number ofERP components, notably the P3 latency on day 1, but nefazodone andparoxetine did not significantly affect these parameters. Hegerlet al. (1990)found increases in amplitudes and latencies of early AEP components (P1, N1)after 10 days of lithium administration to healthy volunteers. They did notinterpret the finding but stated that similar effects are observed in bipolarpatients treated with lithium.3.4.3 ANXIOLYTIC AND HYPNOTIC DRUGS (Table 3.7)Subjective EffectsIn some experimental paradigms of situational anxiety, benzodiazepines wereshown to have relaxing or even anxiolytic effects in healthy subjects. However,this observation has not been confirmed in all studies and seems to be restrictedto a narrow dose range: just a slight increase in dose leads to feelings oftiredness, drowsiness and languor in healthy subjects. Similar effects areexperienced by healthy subjects after taking usual doses of sleep-inducingagents of the benzodiazepine group. Instead of relaxation, either no effect orgeneral sedation is experienced after administration of the non-benzodiazepineanxiolytic buspirone and the hypnotic drugs zolpidem (Rushet al., 1996) andzopiclone.82PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Behavioral EffectsThere are hundreds of published studies on the effects of benzodiazepineanxiolytics and hypnotics onperformance parametersin healthy subjects, and itis generally recognized that these drugs cause a dose-related reduction in mostPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS83Figure 3.6Effect of a tricyclic antidepressant on polygraphic sleep stages.

Tasks that appear to be particularly sensitive to theeffects of benzodiazepines are those calling for complex motor or psychomotorcoordination, such as simulated traffic situations. Vigilance tests of longerduration are also considered to be very sensitive. In the hands of manyinvestigators, reaction times to different configurations of stimuli were not verysensitive; in contrast, Wesnes and collaborators have performed a number ofstudies with simple and more complex reaction time paradigms (e.g. Thompsonet al., 1999) and found them very sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines. Inthe case of the anxiolytic buspirone, no adverse effects on performance areusually detected after single doses corresponding to the therapeutically usedones, whereas the sedating action of the non-benzodiazepine hypnoticszolpidem (Rushet al., 1996) and zopiclone manifests itself in various areasof performance. Benzodiazepines (with the exception of clobazam) and thenon-benzodiazepine hypnotic zolpidem decrease the CFF but buspirone doesnot affect it (Curran and Wattis, 1998).Great interest has traditionally been shown in the amnestic effects of thebenzodiazepines, which are also utilized in anesthesiology. When given prior tosurgery, higher doses of these compounds lead to amnesia covering the periodimmediately preceding, during and – depending on the dose and the durationof action of the preparation used – after an operation. This led to the questionas to whether amnestic effects of benzodiazepines also occur in their use as84PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 3 .7Effects of anxiolytic drugs in healthy subjectsArea of assessmentBenzodiazepines andrelated drugsNon-benzodiazepines(buspirone)Subjective effectsRelaxation; tirednesswith higher (therapeutic)dosesNo effect at lower, possiblysedation at higher dosesAttention, concentration Impairment at higher(therapeutic) dosesNo effectPerceptionCFF reducedNo effectLearning, memoryImpairmentNo effectVerbal, logical functions No clear effectsNo dataMotor, executive functions Slower saccades.

Curranet al. (1998) reported findingsfrom a study with lorazepam, which, in their interpretation, ‘‘provide strongevidence for a dissociation between the effects on episodic memory and onarousal’’ of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Given its clinical importance, thiscontroversial issue is treated more extensively in Chapter 7 (Section 7.4.2).NeurophysiologyBenzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics lead to a decrease in alpha and anincrease in beta activity in pharmaco-EEG trials. With regard to theta anddelta activities, the results of different studies vary. Buspirone at the usualtherapeutic doses induces no or only a very weak EEG effect (Greenblattet al.,1994) and is thus differentiated from the benzodiazepine anxiolytics.In polygraphic sleep studies benzodiazepines stabilize and, at higher doses,increase the duration of sleep. Also at higher doses benzodiazepines are reportedto reduce the proportion of REM sleep and the number of eye movements duringREM sleep (REM density). A striking feature emerging in polygraphic sleepstudies is the increase in spindle activity, i.e. groups of waves arising phasically inthe 12–14 Hz band, after benzodiazepines at higher doses or after repeatedadministration. Another feature of the benzodiazepines, not shared by zolpidemand zopiclone, is a reduction of slow-wave sleep after single doses, and even morepronounced after repeated administration (Parrino and Terzano, 1996).Early work by Saletu (1976), which suggested that latencies of primary EPresponses are prolonged and those of secondary responses are shortened afterbenzodiazepines, has not been replicated by other authors. Urataet al. (1996)observed prolonged P300 latencies and reduced P300 amplitudes after smalldoses of triazolam. This was similar to a report by Pooviboonsuket al. (1996)about prolonged P300 latencies and reduced P300 amplitudes after two dosesof lorazepam. In contrast, van Leeuwenet al. (1995) observed reducedamplitudes of the P1, N1, P2N2 and P3 waves but no changes of latencies tothese potentials after two doses of oxazepam given to healthy volunteers.3.4.4 PSYCHOSTIMULANT DRUGS (Table 3.8)Subjective EffectsAmphetamines and related psychostimulants, modafinil and caffeine (ingestedas capsules or as caffeinated drinks), produce feelings of increased energy andactivity. These effects are particularly pronounced if subjects are engaged instrenuous or monotonous activities of longer duration. According to somereports, there seems to be a minority of subjects who show negative responsesto stimulants and may feel tired, listless and occasionally even depressed (Corrand Kumari, 2000).PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS85"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Behavioral EffectsThe effects of stimulants onperformance criteriahave been studied extensivelyand may be summarized as follows:(1) Improvements in performance after amphetamine in dosages of 2.5–20 mgare particularly marked in tasks where prolonged attentiveness andconcentration are called for. With increasing test duration the positiveeffect of amphetamine on performance in tests of cancellation, arithmeticsand vigilance becomes more pronounced.(2) A few studies involving amphetamine suggested improved learning andmemory performance. These effects presumably may be attributed toimproved alertness during the acquisition phase (Chapter 7).(3) Performance involving a motor component is improved only slightly inrested subjects, but improvements are more pronounced when the testpersons are exhausted, e.g. after sleep deprivation.A frequently used test to assess the effect of psychostimulants is theCPT. Methylphenidate at doses of around 0.3 mg/kg usually improvesperformance, i.e. reduces the number of errors, on the CPT whereasthe effects ofd-amphetamine (at doses between 5 and 20 mg) and pemoline(10–60 mg) appear to be less reliable (Riccioet al., 2001).

Doses tested and found to be effectiveusually lay between 75 mg (corresponding to two cups of coffee) and 750 mg.Significant improvement in the Wilkinson vigilance test and in a complexreaction test was seen after just 32 mg of caffeine, i.e. after an amountcorresponding to a cola drink or a cup of coffee. Single doses of 250 and500 mg/70 kg caffeine attenuated the negative effects of the benzodiazepinelorazepam on a number of performance tasks (Rushet al., 1994). Improvementin psychomotor performance and vigilance results from the administration ofmodafinil (another catecholaminergic stimulant) in subjects previously fatiguedby sleep deprivation. Thus, after 40-h periods of continuous wakefulness, pilotsin a helicopter simulator performed significantly better when given 600 mg ofmodafinil than on placebo, with the greatest effect seen between 0330 and1130 hours when the combined impact of sleep loss and the circadian troughwas most severe (Caldwellet al., 2000).NeurophysiologyPublished pharmaco-EEG trials provide a heterogeneous picture: some studieswithd-amphetamine and methylphenidate reported a reduction in delta andtheta waves; other authors found either an increase in delta and theta activityor no effect at all on the quantified EEG. There is also no agreement in the caseof changes in the alpha and beta bands after several stimulants. Some of thecontradictory findings are most likely to be due to different experimentalconditions, particularly the duration of EEG recordings (for details see Spiegel,1996, p. 90).Stimulants, if taken in the evening, delay sleep onset, impair the continuity ofsleep at low doses and curtail its duration at higher doses (Fig. 3.7).Amphetamine-like stimulants and caffeine have different effects on REM sleep,which is unchanged after caffeine but dose-dependently reduced afteramphetamine. Modafinil at single doses of 100 and 200 mg has only weakeffects on the sleep polygram, with a pattern similar to that of amphetamine.According to Saletu (1976), latencies of primary and secondary responses areshortened after stimulants. Methylphenidate was reported to enhance P300amplitudes in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Jonkmanetal., 2000), and whether the compound has similar effects in healthy volunteers isnot known. The amplitude of the CNV was reported to be increased afterstimulants, although the opposite effect has also been observed in some studies.3.4.5 NOOTROPICS AND ANTIDEMENTIA DRUGSSubjective EffectsFew results are available from experiments in healthy volunteers involving theuse of the older nootropic drugs, such as co-dergocrine mesylate, piracetam orPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS87"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"vincamine; findings reviewed some years ago suggested that single doses ofthese substances in the therapeutic dose range have no subjective stimulant orother effect in healthy young volunteers (Spiegel, 1992).

After larger doses REM sleep is evenmore markedly reduced and total sleep time (TST) is shortened (reproduced fromSpiegel,1982, with permission from S. KargerAG, Basel)"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"and our own results with co-dergocrine mesylate, piracetam and vincamine(Spiegel, 1992), it is safe to assume that a single administration of theseproducts at usual therapeutic doses has no effect on the performance of healthysubjects. Cholinergic agents such as the muscarinic agonist RS 86 and thecholinesterase inhibitors donepezil and rivastigmine did not have an impact oncognitive or behavioral parameters at well-tolerated single doses (Azconaet al.,1986; Enzet al., 1991; Nathanet al., 2001). Another cholinesterase inhibitor,pyridostigmine, given three times a day for five consecutive days, wasassociated with an improvement in reaction time on tests of memory andattention and fewer errors on a tracking task (Cooket al., 2002).NeurophysiologyNootropics induce very weak or no EEG effects at all in single-doseexperiments in healthy subjects. A lack of significant effects was also foundin sleep polygraphic studies with several nootropic drugs (Magginiet al., 1988;Spiegel, 1992).Compounds with direct or indirect agonistic effects on cholinergic receptorsfacilitate the appearance of REM sleep early in the night: shorter REM sleeplatencies were noted after the cholinesterase inhibitors physostigmine (Gillinand Sitaram, 1984) and tacrine (Riemannet al., 1996). The muscarinic agonistsRS 86 (Spiegel, 1984) and pilocarpine (Berkowitzet al., 1990; Seifritzet al.,1998) also shortened the REM latency of healthy subjects. The cholinesteraseinhibitor rivastigmine was found to increase REM density early in the nightbut had no significant effect on REM latency (Holsboer-Trachsleret al., 1993).3.5 DISCUSSION3.5.1 DIFFERENTIAL DRUG EFFECTSPsychotropic drugs induce a variety of subjective and objective effects that canbe detected and quantified using psychometric and neurophysiologicalmethods. With regard to the first question posed in Section 3.1 – i.e. whetherpsychotropic drugs used in different clinical indications produce differentialand perhaps specific patterns of activity when given to healthy subjects – thefindings summarized in the foregoing paragraphs suggest the following:(1)Antipsychoticdrugswith strong sedative clinical effects (e.g.chlorpromazine, clozapine, olanzapine) produce subjective and objectivesedation and impair most areas of performance in healthy volunteers,usually at doses far below those typically used in patients. Antipsychoticdrugs with little sedative clinical action (e.g. pimozide, sulpiride,amisulpride) produce few subjective and objective effects in healthyPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS89"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"subjects, even if given at doses that are close to those used clinically. Thus,as in therapeutic use, antipsychotic drugs do not show a uniform pattern ofactivity in healthy subjects, but the clinically more and the less sedativerepresentatives of the class also differ with regard to their effects on healthyvolunteers. It should be noted that the less sedative antipsychotics arerelatively pure D2 dopaminergic antagonists (Chapter 4), whereas thesedative, sleep-promoting compounds also have effects on muscarinic,noradrenergic and histaminic receptors. Neurophysiological techniques,notably pharmaco-EEG studies, generally confirm the distinction betweenmore and less sedative compounds, although there does not seem to be aspecific neurophysiological pattern of activity of antipsychotic drugs.(2)Antidepressant drugswith more and with less sedative clinical action showsimilarly different effects in healthy volunteers to those seen with more andless sedative antipsychotics. Studies in healthy volunteers do not reveal aspecific subjective or behavioral profile of antidepressants and, based ontheir effects in such experiments, it would not be possible to distinguishreliably between sedative antipsychotics and antidepressants or betweennon-sedative antipsychotics and antidepressants. As is the case withantipsychotics, antidepressants with strong sedative action in patients andhealthy subjects affect muscarinic, noradrenergic and histaminic receptors(Chapter 4). Pharmaco-EEG studies also help to differentiate betweensedative and non-sedative antidepressants but, in contrast to some claimsby earlier authors, there does not appear to be a specific ‘antidepressantEEG profile’. Furthermore, although many antidepressants do suppressREM sleep in polygraphic sleep studies in healthy volunteers, this effect isnot shared by all clinically effective antidepressants, and there are manyother drugs, with no recognized antidepressant activity, that also delay theonset of REM sleep and reduce its duration.(3)Anxiolyticsof the benzodiazepine type produce dose-dependent subjectivesedation; they also impair a wide range of performance parameters inhealthy volunteers, usually at doses identical or close to those used inpatients with anxiety syndromes. Some anxiolytics may be qualitativelydifferent from sedative antipsychotics and antidepressants with regard totheir subjective effects noted by healthy volunteers (benzodiazepines areperceived by many subjects as being pleasantly relaxing), but nuances ofthis kind have not been studied in direct comparative trials. With regard toits subjective and behavioral effects the non-benzodiazepine anxiolyticbuspirone and its derivatives may be more similar to the non-sedativeantipsychotics and antidepressants than to benzodiazepines, but hereagain there are no direct comparative trials. A striking feature of thebenzodiazepines is their effect on some neurophysiological characteristics,in particular the marked increase of slow beta waves (12–14 Hz) seen inwake EEGs and in the EEG recorded during sleep. This effect is not shared90PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"by the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, indicating that it is not related tothe anxiolytic effect but rather to some specific pharmacological action ofthe benzodiazepines.(4)Psychostimulantsof the amphetamine type (which have been little studiedin the last 10 years) as well as caffeine can be clearly distinguished from theother classes of psychotropic drugs on the basis of their subjective andobjective effects: in no other drug class is there a consistent pattern ofsubjective and objective improvements in drive, mood and performance asin the case of stimulants. Sustained wakefulness (or vigilance) afteramphetamine, caffeine, etc. can also be demonstrated in EEG trials:although none of these compounds displays a specific pattern of EEGeffects, they keep subjects awake in longer recordings and can thus bedistinguished from placebo and other drugs (Fig. 3.8). In polygraphic all-night recordings, stimulant drugs interfere with the onset and duration ofsleep; furthermore, amphetamine-like drugs suppress REM sleep in a dose-dependent fashion.(5) The so-callednootropicshave no actions in healthy volunteers thatcharacterize them as clearly active in the brain or as an independent classof psychotropic substances.(6) Although there are only few published data withantidementia drugs, theeffects of cholinesterase inhibitors in healthy awake volunteers appearto be unspecific. In contrast, the REM-sleep facilitating effect of thesecompounds appears to be a property not shared by other psychotropicdrugs.3.5.2 SENSITIVITY OF THE ASSESSMENT METHODS USED INPHARMACOPSYCHOLOGYDose–effect studieswith well-known drugs can be used to determine thesensitivity of different assessment methods: in experiments of this kind thelowest dose of a given drug that leads to reliable changes from baseline on aparticular parameter can be considered a marker of its sensitivity. Anassessment method is recognized as being particularly sensitive when itindicates a drug effect at doses that do not yet induce effects on otherparameters measured at the same time.Kraepelin (1892, p. 88) assumed ‘‘that the course of very simple mentalprocesses which have furthermore become almost automatic through longpractice is less changed by the influence of medicaments than are those morecomplex processes which always represent a special mental performance’’.Accordingly, a complex task such as driving a car should be a more sensitiveindicator of drug effects than the simple tapping task. However, inspection ofTables 3.5–3.8 shows that Kraepelin’s assumption is not so generallyapplicable: for example, in some of the older experiments with antipsychoticPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS91"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"drugs, doses that induced reliable changes on several other parameters ofperformance had little effect on more complex verbal and logical tasks, and therelative insensitivity of intelligence tests to sedative drug effects was also foundin studies with anxiolytics. With regard to psychostimulants, Weiss and Laties(1962) stressed that the performance-improving effect of these drugs is clearerin the simple and repetitive than in the more intellectually demanding tasks.Latz (1968), in another thorough review of early studies with psychostimulants,reached a similar conclusion.The issue of sensitivity of different objective assessment methods has beendiscussed extensively in earlier editions of this volume (Spiegel and Aebi, 1983,p. 75; Spiegel, 1989, p. 72). The – somewhat updated – conclusions were asfollows:(1) Methods that focus on attention and concentration are particularlysensitive to the actions of drugs, even though impairments caused bysedative substances are not always detected in tests of short duration.92PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 3.8Effects ofd-amphetamine onthe wake EEG. Mean EEG spectral values for sixhealthy male subjects who took placebo, 5 mg and10 mg ofd-amphetamine on separateoccasions in a balanced crossover trial are shown. Whereas the EEG trace 2h afterplacebo (upper third) shows a rapid decline in alpha waves and an increase in thetawaves (see arrows pointing to the alpha decrease and the theta increase), thecorresponding changes occurred later after 5mg (middle third) and 10mg (lower third)d-amphetamine.The decay of alpha and increase of theta activities occurred after 2minon placebo, but only after 7 min on 5 mgd-amphetamine and after 12 min on 10 mg ofd-amphetamine, thus reflecting a vigilance-stabilizing effect ofd-amphetamine (Matejcek,1979, with permission)"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Vigilance tests and continuous performance tests (Table 3.1), whichusually last for more than 15 min, take first place with regard to sensitivity(see also Koelega, 1989, 1993). More recent work (e.g. Thompsonet al.,1999) suggests that computerized reaction time tasks of short duration maybe equally as sensitive as some of the older, longer tests.(2) Except for the CFF technique, methods that assess perception have foundlittle use in recent studies. The CFF seems to respond very sensitively tosedative substances, especially benzodiazepines (see also Curran andWattis, 1998).(3) Motor and so-called psychomotor tasks, e.g. reaction-time tests of varyingcomplexity, also respond reliably to sedative and stimulant drug effects(Kunsmanet al., 1992); however none of the procedures shows particularlygreat sensitivity.(4) Methods that assess thought processes or aspects of intelligence have notbeen used in more recent studies; their sensitivity to the effects ofpsychotropic drugs seems to be low.(5) Learning and memory processes may be impaired by sedative substances,especially benzodiazepines and related drugs; this topic will be discussedfurther in Chapter 7.An important and also practical question concerns the relative sensitivity ofsubjective and objective assessment instruments used in pharmacopsychologyand elsewhere: If subjects are negatively affected by drugs with regard to theircognitive or motor performance, will this always be reflected in their self-assessment? This issue was studied in a systematic way some time ago by Byeet al.(1973, 1978), Clubleyet al.(1979) and Pecket al.(1979). Among thesubjective methods, the VAS stood out as being particularly sensitive; amongthe objective procedures the Wilkinson vigilance test was the most sensitive. Atvery low doses of sedative or stimulating substances, both of these methodswere about equal in terms of their sensitivity, suggesting that objectiveimpairment (or improvement) of performance is generally perceived by testsubjects in an experimental situation. Whether this conclusion can beextrapolated to everyday life, e.g. to traffic or complex professional situations,is a different question. Thus, Wesnes (personal communication) quotes theexample of a study by Beuzenet al.(1999), which showed that self-ratedalertness by healthy subjects clearly underestimated the extent of impairmentrecorded in tests of vigilance and attention. Still, subjective methods such as theVAS are time-economical and they also make it possible to determinesubstance effects outside the stimulation–sedation continuum.Whether any of the neurophysiological approaches is more or less sensitivethan psychological instruments to delineate drug effects in healthy volunteers isdifficult to judge because only a few studies used both types of methodology inparallel. Nevertheless, in order to provide a rough overview, Table 3.9 sets outPSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS93"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"those doses of some older psychotropic drugs that were found to producestatistically significant effects in a diversity of separate studies usingpsychological and electrophysiological measurement methods. The picturethat arises is incomplete (particularly in the absence of usable informationconcerning EPs and ERPs) but does reveal that electrophysiological andpsychological parameters generally respond to drug doses of the same order ofmagnitude. In the case of sedative substances, i.e. some antipsychotics,antidepressants and anxiolytics, the minimum effective doses at the variouslevels of measurement are similar, and the same applies to psychostimulants.Sleep polygraphic studies appear to be particularly sensitive to the actions ofmany antidepressants, mainly those that suppress REM sleep. Sleeppolygraphic studies also indicate a facilitatory effect of some antidementiadrugs (cholinesterase inhibitors) upon REM sleep, although this class ofcompounds will not produce significant effects in other areas of assessment.In a review article published in 1986, Mu ̈nteet al.expressed their surprise atthe fact that the effects of psychotropic drugs on ERPs had not received greatattention. The few studies of P300 cited by Mu ̈nteet al.suggested thatcompounds such as methylphenidate and scopolamine could influence certaincomponents of the P300 complex. However, because the correspondingexperiments were mostly performed with specific experimental–psychologicalrather than pharmacological orientation, it is not possible to assess thesensitivities of the various P300 paradigms for pharmacological questions.Because only isolated EP and ERP drug studies have been published in themeantime, it is still not possible to judge the sensitivity of these neurophysio-logical approaches for psychopharmacology.3.5.3 UNDERSTANDING AND PREDICTING CLINICAL DRUG EFFECTSAs shown in the foregoing paragraphs, it is possible to delineate sedative andstimulant drug effects in healthy subjects and to relate them to the effects andside effects seen with the same drugs in a clinical situation. A variety of partlycomplementary methods is available for this purpose. On the other hand, theredo not seem to be reliable experimental equivalents (‘surrogate markers’) ofantipsychotic or antidepressant drug effects in healthy subjects that could beused to distinguish between representatives of these two classes of drugs or topredict the clinical indication of novel compounds. In other words, it is notpossible to understand or predict the specific therapeutic effects of antipsychoticand antidepressant drugs from their effects occurring in healthy subjects.Beyond the possibility of characterizing stimulant and sedative drug effectsin a controlled setting, what is the relevance of performing studies withpsychotropic drugs in healthy volunteers? From a pragmatic standpoint onecould argue as follows: drug experiments in healthy subjects make it possible todetect subjective, behavioral and neurophysiological drug effects after small,94PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS95Table 3 . 9Sensitivity of psychological and electrophysiological parametersto psychotropic drug effectsSubstanceclassCompoundSubjectivecriteriaPerformanceparameterseffect Wake EEGSleep polygramAntipsychoticsChlorpromazineClozapineHaloperidol25–50 mg5mg2mg25–50 mgNo dataUp to 4 mg#050 mg5, 10 mgUp to 4 mg12.5 mg5, 10 mg1mgAntidepressantsAmitriptylineImipramineMianserin6.25–12.5 mg50 mgNo data6.25–12.5 mg75 mg15 mg###25 mg35 mg15 mg12.5 mg25 mg5, 10 mgAnxiolyticsChlordiazepoxideDiazepamMeprobamate10–30 mg5–10 mgUp to 800 mg20 mg5mgUp to 800 mg##0No data5mg600 mg35 mg5mg400 mgPsychostimulantsd-AmphetamineCaffeineMethylphenidate5mg75 mgNo data2.5 mg75 mg10–20 mg\"\"\"5mg100 mg (?)30 mg2.5–5 mg200 mg5mgThe table shows the smallest single dose producing significant changes in the respective area of measurement.

Thus, drug studies inhealthy subjects can be useful at several stages of drug development (seeChapter 5): in early stages, as so-called screening trials, i.e. to roughlycharacterize novel, clinically yet unknown substances with regard to theireffects on the human brain; in later stages, for studying aspects of drug safetyand for the investigation of other major practical questions.In our own work with potential antidementia drugs we have made use ofpsychological as well as neurophysiological techniques to study the effects ofcholinergic agents in healthy volunteers. Once the REM-sleep enhancingproperties of muscarinic agonists and cholinesterase inhibitors had beendemonstrated (see Section 3.4.5), we used polygraphic sleep recordings to test anumber of such drugs (e.g. Hohagenet al., 1993) in healthy volunteers.Rivastigmine (ENA 713), a dual cholinesterase inhibitor, was found to increasethe density of rapid eye movements during REM sleep (Holsboer-Trachsleret al., 1993) at doses that were well tolerated by healthy subjects in precedingtrials (Enzet al., 1991). The REM-enhancing doses (1–2 mg) were consideredthe minimum CNS-active ones and were included as single starting doses in thefirst clinical trials in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Clinically effective dosesof Exelon1(rivastigmine) in Alzheimer patients were determined at 3–6 mggiven twice a day, with some individuals also responding to 2 mg twice a day –thus providing a positive example for the practical relevance of drugexperiments in healthy subjects.3.5.4 THEORY-ORIENTATED ISSUESA number of authors, notably Wilhelm Janke, have referred to the possibilityof using psychotropic drugs experimentally for theory-orientated objectives:‘‘The administration of drugs represents a central research strategy forphysiological psychology. It is distinguished from other classical methods, suchas lesions, by the reversibility and quantifiability (by using different doses) ofthe effects achieved. In humans, the administration of drugs is often the onlyfeasible method for modifying somatic processes directly and thus to studythem as independent variables’’ (Janke and Erdmann, 1992, p. 121). Anexample of the use of psychotropic drugs in physiological psychology would bethe administration of a neuroleptic of the haloperidol type (as a dopamine D2antagonist) and ofd-amphetamine (as an indirect dopamine agonist) to studyrelationships between the dopaminergic activity in the brain and psychologicalconstructs such as attentiveness, mood, etc. Prerequisites for experiments ofthis type are: the availability of pharmacologically well-characterized, safe and96PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"well-tolerated drugs with specific actions; and the confidence that suitableinstruments are available to determine complex mental functions such asattentiveness or mood (e.g. King and Henry, 1992).Theory-orientated objectives in the context of differential psychologyfocussed on the relationships between so-called personality features (e.g.neuroticism or extraversion according to Eysenck, 1962) and drug actions, atopic of great interest in the 1960s. It was repeatedly shown that subjects withhigher levels of ‘anxiety’ could respond to sedative substances in a different wayfrom less anxious test subjects. This differential response was explained on thebasis of a theory of activation (Claridge, 1967), i.e. as the consequence ofdifferent baseline ‘levels of arousal’ of anxious and less anxious subjects. Janke,Debus, Kohnen and other German authors also examined the question of howfar the test situation in pharmacopsychological experiments could be modifiedin the directions of ‘stress accentuation’ or ‘relaxation’, and how manipulationsof this type would influence the responses of healthy subjects to drugs. Studiesof this kind, which do not seem to be fashionable at the present time, arediscussed extensively and with the appropriate literature references by Debusand Janke (1986), Janke and Erdmann (1992) and Kohnen (1992).3.6 CONCLUSIONSMany, and quite differentiated, drug effects can be shown and quantified inhealthy volunteers under standardized and thus reproducible conditions. Theinformation gathered in these experiments can be usefully applied in a numberof theoretical and practical contexts. This chapter has not dealt with some ofthe herbal medicines, and we also omitted discussion of older studies withsimultaneous or consecutive administration of more than one drug, e.g. the so-called scopolamine model to study cognition enhancers (see Spiegel, 1989,p. 180). As will be noted in Chapter 5, experiments in healthy volunteers stillplay their role in the development of new drugs, some of them under the newname of ‘proof of concept’ (PoC) or ‘proof of effect’ (PoE) studies.PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS97"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"4Preclinical ResearchinPsychopharmacologyByCONRAD GENTSCH4.1 INTRODUCTIONThis chapter deals with a fact that may be hard to understand at first sight,namely that psychopharmaceuticals – chemical compounds administered inthe form of tablets, capsules or injections – can act on mental phenomena suchas feelings, mood, behavior and positive and negative symptoms. The termmechanism of actionexpresses the fact that the effects of drugs on mentalprocesses do not occur directly but via a chain of intermediate links. Some ofthese links, i.e. biochemical, neurobiological and electrophysiological pro-cesses, are discussed in the first four sections of this chapter.Psychopharmaceuticals are most frequently taken in the form of tablets, capsulesor coated tablets, i.e. orally. Parenteral presentations are also available for somepsychopharmaceuticals, i.e. injection or infusion solutions that can be administereddirectly into the bloodstream and thus circumvent the gastrointestinal tract.Questions of absorption, metabolism and absorption of these drugs will bediscussed in Chapter 5, which deals with clinical trials in psychopharmacology.Psychopharmaceuticals exert their intended effects in the central nervoussystem (CNS), where they primarily affect those processes that are involved inthe transmission of information between nerve cells. All these drugs act via oneor several mechanisms that are thought to be impaired or functioningsuboptimally in patients with mental disturbances.

By specifically interfering with these mechanisms, readjustmentof the processes underlying mental functioning is achieved and this representsthe drug’s therapeutic benefit. We will describe the most important hypotheses,some historical, that were formulated to explain the effects of antipsychotic,antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs.Psychopharmaceuticals may be of natural origin (e.g. phytotherapeuticsextracted from plants), chemically modified natural products or they may havean entirely new, purely synthetic chemical structure. Identification andpreclinical development of new psychotropic drugs involve several majorsteps: once a compound has been synthesized in medicinal chemistry, it issubmitted to extensivein vitrocharacterization prior to its initial testing in livinganimals. If rated as being of potential interest based onin vitrofindings, thecompound will be evaluated in initialin vivostudies for brain penetration andbrain and plasma pharmacokinetics and, if applicable,in vivotests of functionalagonism or antagonism are performed. Indication-finding studies follow, inwhich the candidate compound is compared with clinically known, effectivecompounds for potential anxiolytic, antidepressant, antipsychotic or otherpsychotropic properties. Once a dose–response relationship and, ideally, also aminimal effective dose have been established, additionalin vivostudies mainlydeal with the likely side-effect profile of the drug candidate. These latter studiesaim at demonstrating superiority of the novel compound over the best availabledrugs with regard to tolerability because even a drug with similar efficacy toexisting medication may be a successful therapeutic agent if it has a superior side-effect profile. Assuming that the extensive toxicological tests that terminate thepreclinical evaluation of the compound do not point to any prohibitive findings,the compound’s clinical development (Chapter 5) can be initiated.Much of the preclinical work with a new compound deals with so-calledanimal models, i.e. experimental set-ups thought to provide relevantinformation on the mechanism of action of a drug and to allow predictionsabout its potential clinical use. Sections 4. 5 and 4. 6 of this chapter providedescriptions of typical models used in many of these studies. Although some ofthese models are based upon hypotheses concerning the mechanisms of actionof existing psychopharmaceuticals, the emphasis of these sections is onbehavioral models that appear to be of greatest interest in the current context.4.2 THE TARGET4.2.1 THE NERVOUS SYSTEMThe nervous system is probably the most important organ system of higherorganisms. Anatomically, a distinction is made between the CNS and the100PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"peripheral nervous system: the CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord,the peripheral nervous system comprises all nerves outside these two structures.Within the peripheral nervous system additional distinctions are made eitherbetween the efferent part (the part involved in transmitting information fromthe CNS to the periphery of the body) and the afferent part (the part involvedin transmitting information from the periphery to the CNS) or between thesensory–somatic and the autonomous system.For efferents linking the CNS with skeletal muscles the term ‘motorefferents’ is used, whereas those efferents linking the CNS with glands andsmooth- and cardiac muscle are named ‘vegetative efferents’. Afferents aredistinguished into ‘somatic afferents’ and ‘visceral afferents’, depending onwhether the information flow towards the CNS stems from joints, muscle orskin or the viscera, respectively. The term ‘viscera’ designates organs of thedigestive, respiratory, urogenital and endocrine systems as well as the spleen,heart and great vessels.4.2.2 NEURONSLike all the other organs the nervous system is built up of individual cells. Inthe brain mainly two types of cells are found: neurons, which conduct actionpotentials, andglia cells. The neurons are still the main focus ofneurobiological research and much less attention has been paid to the gliacells, because they are considered to be the brain’s packing material (glia inGreek originates from the word for glue) with the primary function ofdelivering nutrition for the neurons. Today, astrocytes, one dominant type ofglia cells, are considered to be much more important, having control overneurogenesis, the generation of new neuronal cells (Songet al., 2002).As depicted in Fig. 4.1, neurons, despite a high region-dependent variabilityin shape, have a common basic structure. Each neuron consists of the cell body(soma, which contains the cell nucleus), several dendrites and an axon thatspreads out distally into axon branches.Neurons are the material units of information processing in the nervoussystem. Each individual neuron is connected to dozens up to several thousandsPRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY101Figure 4.1Diagram showing the structure of a neuron"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"of other neurons. It is the sum of all the impulses (stimulatory or inhibitory)arriving at a given moment from all connected neurons that ultimatelydetermines the current activity of a neuron. This activity level then determineswhich information is propagated to a large number of other connectedneurons. Given this high interconnectivity it is evident how complex the flow ofinformation, in the form of electrical impulses (see below) within groups andbetween groups of neurons, can be. Keeping in mind that the number ofneurons in a human brain is 1010–1013, this certainly adds ample evidence forthe impressive dimension of neuronal complexity and the capacity of our brain(see Box 4.1). It is thus becoming clear that suboptimal connectivity as well asany changed sensitivity of neurons may be detrimental and lead to alteredfunctionality, reflected in less efficient mental processing and ultimately mentaldeficiency and/or illnesses.Box 4.1 A Metaphor for the Brain’s ComplexityWithin our brains there are some hundred billion neuronsTo get an idea of just how big a hundred billion is, the Amazonrain forest offers an appropriate analogy. The Amazon rain foreststretches for 2 700 000 square miles and contains a hundred billiontrees. There are about as many trees as neurons in the brain.Considering the huge number of connections between neurons,there are about as many as the leaves on the trees in the Amazonjungle.4.2.3 SYNAPSESSynapses are the contact points of two nerve cells or of a nerve cell with aneffector cell (such as a muscle, glandular or sensory cell). It is at the synapse,exactly at the synaptic cleft, where the transfer of information from one cell tothe next takes place. It is estimated that the diameter of a synaptic cleft, i.e. thedistance between the presynaptic membrane (part of the first cell) and thepostsynaptic membrane (part of the second cell), is about 100–300mm.Depending on the carrier of information, electrical and chemical synapses canbe distinguished:.In anelectrical synapsethe electrical signal is transferred directly becausethe membranes of the two cells are in close vicinity. This is the fastestpossible intercellular propagation system of information. Electrical synapsesare present and have been studied mainly in lower animals.102PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":".In achemical synapsethe two adjacent membranes are not sufficiently closeto each other and, in order to pass the information from one cell to the next,the electrical signal is converted transiently into a chemical signal. Most ofthe synapses in vertebrates are chemical synapses.The Electrical Part of the Cross-talk between NeuronsIn its resting state every neuron has a negative electrical membrane potential – avoltage difference of about\u000170 mV between the inside and the outside of the cell,i.e. the inside is electrically negative relative to the outside. The difference inelectrical charge is generated as follows: inside the cell there is a lowerconcentration of positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively chargedchloride ions (Cl\u0001) and a higher concentration of positively charged potassiumions (K+) compared with the extracellular space. Depending on the efflux andinflux of these ions (due to their size, only the positively charged ions can crossthe cell membrane) the electrical net charge of a cell is changeable. Influenced bythe input from other neurons, the membrane potential of a neuron is brieflyshifted away from its resting state. In anexcitatory synapsethe membranepotential tends to shift to positive, whereas in aninhibitory synapsethemembrane potential tends to shift to negative. Because any neuron receivessynaptic input from many connected neurons, an integration of the excitatoryand inhibitory inputs takes place, and if the resulting change in the membranepotential rises above the positive threshold then the neuron produces an impulse,the so-calledaction potential. The action potential travels down the axon of thisneuron and either causes a synaptic input to another neuron (if the firing neuronis an interneuron) or a muscle contraction (if the neuron is a motoneuron).The Chemical Part of the Cross-talk between NeuronsOnce the electrical signal has arrived at a chemical synapse (see Fig. 4.2) acascade of events is triggered: with the arrival of an electrical impulse (anaction potential), a chemical compound known as a neurotransmitter isreleased from the presynaptic side into the synaptic cleft. The releasedneurotransmitter then reaches the membrane of the second cell (postsynapticmembrane) where it interacts with a macromolecule, a so-called receptor. It isthis neurotransmitter–receptor interaction that triggers another cascade of(chemical) reactions within the second cell and this ultimately leads to thegeneration of an electrical signal within this cell. This signal then is transferredalong this second cell’s axon towards another synapse.Once a neurotransmitter is bound to the postsynaptically located receptor achange in the electrical potential of the postsynaptic membrane occurs.Depending on both the type of transmitter and the properties of thepostsynaptic receptor involved, the membrane potential of the second cell isPRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY103"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"eitherhyperpolarized, i.e. its electrical charge is shifted to negative, ordepolarized, i.e. its electrical charge is shifted to positive. When the membranepotential reaches a critical value (threshold), an action potential is generatedand transported along the axon.Activation of the postsynaptic receptor also leads to activation of theenzymes involved in the formation of so-called ‘second messengers’ (see Box 4.2for explanation of this and other terms used in this section). Best-known‘second messengers’ are cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclicguanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cleavage products of phosphatidyli-nositol. These molecules are formed at the cell membrane and migrate into thecell where they affect the activity of other enzymes.Receptors are also located on the presynaptic membrane. Theseauto-receptorsregulate the release and synthesis of the neurotransmitter and are partof a feedback mechanism that aims to keep the activation or inhibition withinthe synapse for a discrete time interval and to terminate the signal transfer oncethe information has reached the adjacent cell via removal (inactivation) of theneurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft.104PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 4.2Schematic representation of a chemical synapse, the location within aneuronal network where the transfer of information from one neuron to the next takesplace by means of neurotransmitters"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Box 4.2 Definitions of Some of the Terms UsedSynapse: Location where two neurons are in closest contact andwhere the chemically mediated information propagation takesplaceSynaptic cleft: Gap of about 100–300mm in diameter between twoneurons.

One common structural form is the so-called seven-transmembrane receptor, which consists of seven domains located within themembrane plus an extracellular (top of Fig. 4.3) and an intracellular (bottomof Fig. 4.3) part. Within the receptor molecule there is also a specific bindingpocket (not shown in the figure) for a message molecule (a neurotransmitter orany other ligand) and this part of the three-dimensionally arranged receptormolecule is named the binding site.The interaction between a ligand and its receptor can be characterized by themetaphor of a key (the ligand) and a lock (the binding site of a receptor).Because one can lock and unlock a door only with a specifically tailored andthus closely fitting key, it is only when the ligand is tightly fitting into thebinding site that the receptor will be activated. Subsequent to this event, anactivation or an inhibition of a neuron will occur.Receptors are generally named after their ligand, e.g. dopaminergic,serotonergic, noradrenergic andg-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic receptors.Another distinction of receptors concerns the impact of their activation:ionotropicreceptors directly regulate ion channels;metabotropicreceptors arelinked to an intracellular enzyme via an intermediate G-protein.The GABA-A receptor (Fig. 4.4) constitutes an example of an ionotropicreceptor. It is composed of five different protein subunits – two alpha-1, twobeta-2 and one gamma-2 – and is therefore called a pentamer. Thebenzodiazepine binding site is located at thea1/g2 interphase, whereas theactivation sites for GABA are located at thea1/b2 interphase. Once abenzodiazepine molecule has bound, the receptor will change its shape so thatit responds more to GABA.

Agonistscan be endogenous, i.e. naturally occurring in the respective organism, orexogenous, e.g. a synthetic substance having the same effect at the receptoras the endogenous agonist. Agonists also can be subdivided into fullagonists and partial agonists.

Antagonists can be subdivided intotwo types:competitive antagonistsbind at the same site as do the agonistswhereasnon-competitive antagonistsbind at a site on the receptor that differsfrom the agonist’s binding site.

It is the shape and the physicochemical properties that determine howclosely a molecule fits into the binding pocket. Like all chemical reactions, theligand–receptor interaction is governed by the law of mass action: anequilibrium between the free concentrations of the ligand and receptor andthe concentration of the receptor/ligand complex is established. At equilibrium,the amounts of ligand going onto (association) and going off (dissociation) thereceptor site are identical (Fig. 4.6).Studying ligand–receptor interactions is one of the most widely usedapproaches during thein vitroperiod of drug selection, becausein vitro bindingstudiesprovide crucial information about a compound’s affinity to receptors aswell as about its selectivity among several binding sites. The following Internetlinks provide more details about such studies:.http://www.biotrend.com/pdf/radiochemrev.pdf.http://www.unmc.edu/pharmacology/receptortutorialIn addition toin vitrobinding studies, another experimental approach toevaluate a compound’s interaction with receptors is becoming more and morewidely used. The technique is known aspositron emission tomography(PET)and necessitates that the molecule of interest be labeled with a radioisotope ofshort half-life (ideally18F). Positron emission tomography is used inneuropsychiatry to determine the distribution of a radioactively-labeledcompound (‘radiotracer’) within the brain following peripheral injection ofthe radiotracer into a vein. Studies with PET provide information as to wherein the brain a compound is concentrating and possibly acting. By investigatinghow a novel compound displaces a radioactively labeled radiotracer withknown mechanism of action (e.g. a dopamine antagonist), valuable informa-tion on the therapeutic potential, receptor occupancy and effective dosing of adrug candidate can be made available at an early stage of development (seeAppendix to Chapter 5).PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY109Figure 4.6The interaction between any ligand and a receptor is governed by theequilibrium according to the law of mass action"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"4.2.7 NEUROTRANSMITTERSNeurotransmitters are defined as chemical substances that:(1) Are present in presynaptic terminals.(2) Are released from presynaptic terminals into the synaptic cleft (synapse)upon stimulation of the neuron.(3) Cause an effect (activation or inhibition) at the postsynaptic site.(4) Are inactivated either by a metabolic (enzymatic) mechanism or by removalfrom the synapse through a presynaptically located mechanism (‘re-uptake’).Figure 4.7 gives some basic information on the best known neurotransmitters,their precursors, the enzymes involved in their synthesis, their principalreceptors and their metabolites. Drugs that modulate any of the steps involvedwill affect the availability of the respective neurotransmitter and thus might beused as a potential therapeutic principle to affect the aberrant functioning ofone or several neurotransmitter systems.Serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine and GABA are the bestcharacterized neurotransmitters but the list of known and putative neuro-transmitters is much longer, including:.Amino acids such as glutamate, aspartate, and glycine..Smaller and larger peptides (‘neuropeptides’) such as substance P,somatostatin, vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), neuropep-tide Y or cholecystokinin (CCK).For many of the neuropeptides the receptors are known, and more recentlynon-peptidic, small-molecule antagonists have become available. Applicationof these antagonists will help to elucidate further the involvement of peptidicneurotransmitters within the nervous system, as well as their contribution tomental disturbances.

Speculation certainly concerned possible biological or biochemicaldisturbance in the brain of schizophrenic patients but analytical methodsnecessary to confirm or refute these assumptions were not available. The samewas true when, a few years later, the antidepressant efficacy of imipramine wasdiscovered. All hypotheses regarding the mode of action of psychopharmaceu-ticals evolved slowly, and some of the most recent theories still contain elementsfrom the very early times of modern psychopharmacology.4.3.1 HYPOTHESES RELATING TO THE MODE OF ACTION OFANTIPSYCHOTICSThe Serotonin Hypothesis of SchizophreniaIn 1954, i.e. about 2 years after the discovery of chlorpromazine in Europe, twoAmerican biochemists (Woolley and Shaw) published the hypothesis thatschizophrenia and similar psychoses could be based on a disturbance ofserotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain. This hypothesis was supportedby some facts that had become known shortly beforehand: the spectacularpsychotropic actions of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), which can triggerdisturbances in perception, thought and feelings as well as hallucinations inhealthy subjects (Stoll, 1947); and the serotonin-antagonistic effects of LSD,i.e. its ability to block the actions of serotonin in various pharmacological tests.Although it was not known at this time that serotonin occurs in the brainand acts as a neurotransmitter, Woolley and Shaw speculated that thepsychotropic effects of LSD were the result of its ability to block serotonineffects in the brain; they then suggested that a disturbance in serotoninergicneurotransmission underlies schizophrenic psychoses, which, among otherthings, are characterized by disorders in perception and thought processes.It became known in the same year (1954) that the substance reserpine,derived from the Indian plantRauwolfia serpentina, had antipsychotic effectssimilar to those of chlorpromazine. This finding was of interest for two reasons:the molecular structure of reserpine has some similarity to that of serotoninand LSD; and it was found that reserpine liberates serotonin from presynapticstores in the CNS and thus produces a short-lived excess supply of functionallyavailable serotonin at the synapse. In the context of a serotonin hypothesis ofschizophrenia, it could be postulated that the antipsychotic effect of reserpinewas due to its ability to liberate serotonin presynaptically and make itfunctionally available. However, despite its scientific appeal, the serotoninhypothesis of schizophrenia did not last long because it was in conflict withboth psychopathological and pharmacological findings:112PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"(1) The ‘psychotic’ symptoms produced by LSD in healthy persons differqualitatively and quantitatively from the symptoms typical ofschizophrenia (Bleuler, 1956). Thus, the hallucinations experienced byschizophrenic patients are predominantly acoustic in nature, whereas LSDmainly gives rise to visual phenomena.(2) LSD is not a specific serotonin antagonist but also exerts agonistic effectsat serotonin receptors. On the other hand, many serotonin antagonists,which are more effective than LSD, are not hallucinogenic.(3) In addition to serotonin, reserpine also releases other neurotransmitters,especially dopamine and noradrenaline, from their stores in presynapticnerve endings. Furthermore, the action on the synapse of theneurotransmitters released in this way is limited because they undergointracellular enzymatic degradation.(4) The administration of biological precursors of serotonin, which can beconverted to serotonin in the CNS, was found to have no clear-cutantipsychotic effect in acute schizophrenic patients (in contrast to whathad been predicted by Woolley and Shaw).(5) Unlike reserpine, chlorpromazine has neither a serotonin-like chemicalstructure nor does it release serotonin from nerve endings.Despite its relatively fast and thorough rebuttal, the serotonin hypothesis ofschizophrenia was fruitful in two respects: it gave rise to the development ofsensitive serotonin assay methods and proof that serotonin does occur in thebrain (Carlsson, 1987); and it served as the prototype for other simple and thusreadily testable biochemical hypotheses of mental illnesses. Interest inserotonin has been reawakened in recent years in relation to the mechanismof action of some antipsychotics (see below); however, this development hadlittle to do with the serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia in its originalversion.The Dopamine Hypothesis of SchizophreniaAlthough the serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia was formulated atapproximately the same time as the discovery of the first neuroleptics, it hadno direct connection with the pharmacological properties of these drugs. Thesituation is different in the case of the dopamine hypothesis because all knownneuroleptics have some inhibitory action on dopaminergic neurons, eventhough they vary considerably with regard to other pharmacological effects.At the time of the discovery of chlorpromazine, dopamine could not beassayed directly and its role as a neurotransmitter was unknown (Carlsson,1987). Chlorpromazine exerts a large number of pharmacological effects, all ofwhich could, in principle, be considered responsible for its clinical action. Thus,it was first assumed that the antipsychotic action of chlorpromazine and similarPRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY113"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"neuroleptics depends directly on their cataleptic potency, i.e. their ability toinduce catalepsy in animal experiments, as well as the extrapyramidalsymptoms in clinical use. This assumption first lost credibility whenthioridazine, a neuroleptic with weak extrapyramidal effects but goodantipsychotic activity, became available; the assumed connection wasdefinitively refuted with the introduction of clozapine.In the late 1950s it was found that patients with Parkinson’s disease have adopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia that can be treated withL-dopa, abiological precursor of dopamine. This and the simultaneously observedsimilarity between some symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and the dyskinesiasnoted during neuroleptic treatment led to the assumption that the ‘neurolepticparkinsonoid’ of schizophrenic patients could be due to a disturbance ofdopaminergic neurotransmission. The postulated mechanism of the distur-bance and the significance of dopamine as a neurotransmitter were clarifiedfurther in animal experiments. Carlsson and Lindquist (1963) found thatchlorpromazine increased the turnover of dopamine in mouse brain, whereasno such effect arose on promethazine, a compound chemically related tochlorpromazine but devoid of antipsychotic efficacy. Carlsson and Lindquistinterpreted the effect of chlorpromazine on dopamine turnover as being theconsequence of a hypothetical blockage of dopamine neurotransmissionthrough the action of the neuroleptic. They assumed that presynapticdopaminergic neurons tend to compensate for the blockade of postsynapticreceptors through increased dopamine synthesis and release in order to restorethe functional balance that had been disturbed by the antagonist.Chlorpromazine and other neuroleptic drugs were thus recognized asdopamine antagonists, and the next step was to clarify whether and to whatextent the anti-dopaminergic action of various neuroleptics is related to theirantipsychotic efficacy.In vitroreceptor binding studies indicated that theaffinities of various neuroleptics for dopamine receptors in the brain are highlycorrelated with their antipsychotic potencies (Creeseet al., 1976), which againsupported the dopamine hypothesis of neuroleptic action. However, a closecorrelation existed only with affinity to the dopamine D2 receptor, whereasaffinities for the D1 receptor showed hardly any correlation with the strengthof antipsychotic action (Seeman, 1980).Despite a number of necessary refinements in later years, the dopaminehypothesis in its simple original version (‘neuroleptics act via blockade ofpostsynaptic dopamine receptors’) is still consistent with many pharmacolo-gical and clinical observations, such as:.Parkinson patients treated withL-dopa or dopamine agonists sometimessuffer from hallucinations and other psychosis-like states, and theseabnormalities are most likely a consequence of dopaminergic overstimula-tion.114PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":".Amphetamine used at high doses can provoke a toxic syndrome(‘amphetamine psychosis’) in healthy subjects that shows certain similaritiesto schizophrenic psychoses. Like cocaine, high-dose amphetamine is knownto trigger a massive release of dopamine and noradrenaline frompresynaptic sites and thus to produce a temporary excess supply of bothneurotransmitters at the respective synapses..Even at smaller doses, amphetamine can exacerbate psychosis in schizo-phrenic patients, and similar symptom provocation may arise with otherdopaminergic substances.Some further observations also supported the dopaminergic mechanism ofantipsychotic drugs. Alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT), which interfereswith the synthesis of dopamine and noradrenaline from their biologicalprecursors (and thus also inhibits dopaminergic neurotransmission), augmentsthe antipsychotic efficacy of neuroleptics. Furthermore, the toxic psychosisoccurring in healthy subjects after large and repeated amphetamine doses canbe antagonized by administration of (antidopaminergic) antipsychotics but notnoradrenaline antagonists. Some other empirical findings could not, however,be incorporated unequivocally into the dopamine hypothesis:(1) The blockade of dopamine receptors by antipsychotic drugs is animmediate effect that can be detected even after a single dose, whereasthe therapeutic action of these drugs becomes apparent only after severaldays or weeks of treatment.(2) Dopaminergic agonists such as bromocriptine and apomorphine, whichact directly on postsynaptic receptors, do not provoke psychosis-like statesin healthy subjects.(3) Some schizophrenic patients respond to amphetamine administration notwith a deterioration but with an improvement in their state (Angristet al.,1982).(4) There is no evidence for an elevated dopamine content or hypersensitivityof dopamine receptors in the brain of schizophrenic patients. Breakdownproducts of dopamine and noradrenaline are elevated neither in the urinenor in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of schizophrenic patients. In somepatients with chronic schizophrenia there is even evidence of dopaminehypofunction (Karoumet al., 1987).Despite some unexplained or contradictory findings, the dopamine hypothesisstill represents the best developed overall theoretical basis on which to explainmany biochemical, animal experimental, human pharmacological and clinicalfindings (McKenna, 1987). Criticism is often directed at the overemphasis onone individual neurotransmitter, i.e. disregard for the fact that the transmittersystems in the CNS work in close mutual interdependence.

According to the two-factor theory, schizophrenicdisorders originate from a defect other than dopaminergic overactivity,although the latter is involved as a second factor and augments the intensityof the psychotic process. This dopaminergic factor responds to treatment withantipsychotics so that the disorder becomes attenuated and, ultimately,intrinsic repair processes may bring about complete remission. The two-factortheory does not clarify the nature of the structural, biochemical, psychologicalor other factor(s) that are thought to lie at the origin of the pathologicalprocess.Another hypothesis (Crow, 1982) involves a division of schizophrenias intotwo types: ‘‘Type I corresponds to acute schizophrenia or schizophreniformdisorder in which one observes more positive symptoms of hallucinations anddelusions with a good prognosis and excellent response to neuroleptics. . . TypeII represents chronic schizophrenia with affective flattening, poverty of speechand loss of drive, the so-called negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Type IIpatients respond less well to neuroleptics . . . ’’ (Snyder, 1982). Type I patientswould fit into the dopamine hypothesis whereas a pathophysiological basisother than dopaminergic hyperactivity must be assumed for type II patients.However, as pointed out by Snyder (1982), ‘‘one should be cautious aboutdrawing such a distinction.’’More recent variants of the dopamine hypothesis have been derived mostlyfrom the profile of actions of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and seek torelate pharmacological findings to the clinical actions of this product. At thesame time the pharmacological profile of clozapine is being used as a startingpoint for obtaining safer and more effective antipsychotics. Comparison of themajor clinical and pharmacological effects of clozapine provides the pictureshown in Table 4.1.Although it was (and still is) not known which pharmacological effects areresponsible for the unique clinical action of clozapine, two new hypotheseswere put forward: the so-called 5-HT2:D2 and the D1:D2 equilibriumhypotheses. According to the former, the beneficial actions of clozapine arethe result of simultaneous blockade of (serotonin) 5-HT2 and (dopamine) D2receptors (Meltzer, 1989). According to the latter hypothesis, the clinical effectsof clozapine and particularly the absence of extrapyramidal side effects are dueto the balanced action of clozapine on dopamine D1 and D2 receptors116PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"(Markstein, 1994). Both hypotheses have given rise to dozens of preclinical andclinical studies but it is still open as to which of the two or any otherhypotheses, such as that of frontal dopaminergic underactivity withcompensatory mesolimbic hyperactivity (Daviset al., 1991), is closer to thetruth. Practical use was made of the 5-HT2:D2 hypothesis during thedevelopment and marketing of risperidone (p. 52), although the occurrenceof extrapyramidal symptoms at higher doses of this drug would rather argueagainst this hypothesis. Olanzapine, on the other hand, has a complexpharmacological profile similar to that of clozapine and thus the question as towhich pharmacological features are responsible for the atypicality of the morerecent compounds, including their antipsychotic efficacy, is still open.The Glutamatergic HypothesisAt therapeutically effective doses all antipsychotic compounds, including theatypical ones, are antagonists of central D2 receptors. However, the late onsetof the antipsychotic activity suggests that another still largely unknownmechanism must be involved. Thus, the observation that blockade ofN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, e.g. by means ofphencyclidine, inducesa psychosis-like state in healthy volunteers led to the NMDA hypofunctiontheory, which states that a hypoglutamatergic state at postsynaptic NMDAreceptors is involved in schizophrenia. Unfortunately, testing of the hypothesisthrough the use of direct glutamatergic agonists is hampered by a concern thatexcessive activation of the NMDA receptors might cause excitotoxic damage toneurons (Olney, 1990). As an alternative, indirect modulation of NMDAreceptors via, for example, the AMPA or glycine site, might become animportant treatment strategy for schizophrenia. Preliminary clinical experiencesuggests that adding glycine, D-serine or cycloserine to ongoing antipsychoticmedication may reduce negative and positive symptoms and improve cognitivePRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY117Table 4.1Clinical and pharmacological properties of clozapineClinical featuresEffects observed in animalsStrong antipsychotic efficacy also inpatients refractory to conventionalneurolepticsInhibition of motor activity andconditioned avoidanceAction on negative symptomsRelatively strong binding to (dopamine) D1receptorsBeneficial effects on mood and well-being Blockade of (serotonin) 5-HT2 receptorsNo extrapyramidal side effectsNo catalepsy, no marked antagonism ofapomorphineAnticholinergic side effects, markedsedation at start of therapyAnticholinergic effects, sedation"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"functioning of schizophrenic patients (Heresco-Levyet al., 1996; Tsaiet al.,1998). Furthermore, preclinical studies suggest that AMPA/kainate receptorantagonists and group II mGluR agonists such as LY-354740 might developinto novel therapeutic principles of schizophrenia (Moghaddam and Adams,1998). It is currently considered that the glutamate hypothesis represents awide new avenue to explore compounds that interact subtype-specifically withreceptors involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission for their potential asantipsychotic treatments (for review see Sawa and Snyder 2002; Tsai and Coyle(2002).For additional reading, see Internet link.http//kore.psy.du.edu/manakata/csh/neuron_minirvw_lewis&leiberman.pdf4.3.2 HYPOTHESES RELATING TO THE MODE OF ACTION OFANTIDEPRESSANTSAfter the discovery of drugs with antidepressant activity in the late 1950s, anintensive search was undertaken for pharmacological models that wouldprovide an understanding of the therapeutic effects observed and at the sametime assist in the development of other, still more effective and specificantidepressants. In pharmacological tests then available, the prototypeimipramine showed sedative, antihistaminic and anticholinergic effects andthus did not differ fundamentally from other medicaments with noantidepressant activity, e.g. antihistamines. The following observations thenled to a further step forward in the development of hypotheses:.The behavioral syndrome induced in mice and rats by reserpine – sedation,catalepsy and ptosis – can be reversed by imipramine..The effect of noradrenaline at various organs is potentiated by imipramine..Imipramine inhibits the reuptake of previously released noradrenaline inisolated tissues.Taken together, these findings suggested that imipramine augments the actionof noradrenaline (‘amine potentiation’) or is able to correct a state broughtabout through noradrenaline deficiency. It was also known that reserpine(which was mainly used as an antihypertensive at that time) could triggerclinically relevant depressions in some patients. A subsequent observation –that reserpine released neuronal noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin fromtheir protecting presynaptic stores and thus exposed them to inactivation byintracellular enzymes – led to the first hypotheses concerning the relationshipbetween depressive syndromes and disturbances in the metabolism of theseneurotransmitters: the catecholamine and serotonin hypotheses of depression.118PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"The Catecholamine Hypothesis of DepressionThis was put forward in 1965 by J. Schildkraut and states that ‘‘some, if not all,depressions are the consequence of an absolute or relative deficiency ofcatecholamines, particularly norepinephrine, at functionally important adre-nergic receptor sites in the brain’’ (Schildkraut, 1965, p. 509). The evidencebrought forward in support of this hypothesis was impressive (Table 4.2)because it covered both clinical and multifarious pharmacological findings. Theantidepressant effect of imipramine and of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)inhibitors was attributed to the fact that these medicaments bring about anincreased supply of functionally available catecholamines at the synapse:.Imipramine prevents the reuptake (and hence the inactivation) of previouslyreleased noradrenaline from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic nerveending..The MAO inhibitors prevent the breakdown of the released andfunctionally available catecholamines by the MAO present in theextracellular space (within the cells, monoamines are protected by thevesicles).The catecholamine hypothesis brought several pharmacological findingstogether in an illuminating relationship but contradicted a number of clinicalobservations, in particular the delayed onset of action of antidepressant drugs.This also applies to the serotonin hypothesis, which was formulated at aboutthe same time.The Serotonin Hypothesis of DepressionThis hypothesis states that some or all depressions are due to a lack ofserotonin in certain parts of the brain stem (Coppen, 1967). Older and newerarguments to support the serotonin hypothesis are:.Imipramine and other tricyclic antidepressants inhibit not only the reuptakeof catecholamines into presynaptic nerve endings but have the same effecton serotonin..Monoamine oxidase inhibitors inhibit serotonin inactivation in theextracellular compartment, just as they inhibit catecholamine inactivation..Reserpine, which can trigger depressions, releases not only catecholaminesbut also serotonin from the presynaptic stores..Serotonin and its metabolites are reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of somedepressive patients, which suggests reduced serotoninergic activity in thebrain of these individuals..Serotonin precursors (L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan) have someantidepressant action, whereas a reduction in the blood levels of tryptophanin remitted depressed patients can provoke clinical relapse.PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY119"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Thus, a number of pharmacological and clinical findings can be interpreted tosupport both the catecholamine and the serotonin hypothesis of depression.Depressions do not represent a single uniform disease; there is evidence forcatecholaminergic hypofunction in a proportion of depressive patients,whereas others have features of serotoninergic hypofunction. However, reliablerelationships between biochemical alterations and clinical courses or stateshave not been found, and the hope that subgroups of depression could bedefined by their biochemical features to optimize drug treatment (Maas, 1975;Asberget al., 1976) was not fulfilled.Numerous antidepressants were synthesized, developed and marketed on thebasis of the serotonin hypothesis. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs) are similarly effective as the older tricyclic antidepressants, but havethe advantage of being less toxic and not inducing anticholinergically mediatedside effects (Chapter 1). From the scientific point of view they represent anexample of mechanistic, hypothesis-driven research and development inpsychopharmacology (Chapter 2).CommentAs with the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, the monoamine hypotheses ofdepression emphasize one or more aspects of the actions of clinically effective120PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 4. 2Elements of the catecholamine hypothesis of depressionSubstancePsychologicaleffects in manEffects on behaviorin animalsEffects oncatecholamines atbrain synapsesReserpineSedation; in somecases depressionSedation, catalepsy,hypothermiaIntracellular release,hence rapiddegradation andless availabilityAmphetamine Stimulation, moodimprovementStimulation; athigher dosesstereotypyRelease andinhibition ofre-uptakeMAOinhibitorsAntidepressant effect Stimulation; preventsedation afterreserpinePrevent degradationafter release intosynaptic cleftImipramineAntidepressant effect Prevents sedationafter reserpine;potentiates effectof amphetaminePrevents re-uptakefrom synapticcleftDopaAntidepressant effectin some casesPrevents sedationafter reserpineGreater supply ofcatecholamineprecursors"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"drugs in well-described pharmacological tests. However, whereas dopamineantagonism seems to be a common element of action of all neuroleptics,antidepressants differ more widely with regard to their pharmacologicalspectrum of activities and a common ‘core of action’ has not been identified sofar. This can be interpreted in various ways: firstly, one could assume that theactual mechanism of action of antidepressants is still unknown and that thepharmacological models used capture only epiphenomena of the actionsrelevant to the clinical effect. Another conclusion would be to interrogatecritically the overemphasis on individual transmitter systems as postulatedbases for depressions.Because the various transmitter systems in the brain are directly andindirectly linked together, purely catecholaminergic or purely serotoninergicdepressions are unlikely. Furthermore, the majority of antidepressants knowntoday have multiple effects, especially after repeated administration, and thusaffect a number of transmitter systems. This fact is taken into account by morerecent hypotheses of depression in that a balance between several transmittersystems is postulated as a prerequisite for mental health, whereas affectivepsychoses are believed to be a reflection of an imbalance.OutlookGiven that even the best and most recent antidepressants are clinicallyeffective in only 60–70% of patients, cause many unpleasant (albeit lessdangerous) adverse events and have a slow onset of action, it is a naturalconsequence that much preclinical and clinical research still aims at detectingand developing new principles of antidepressant therapy. Newer approacheshave to come up with therapeutic agents that retain or improve the efficacy ofthe best currently available medications but are superior with regard toaspects mainly related to patient compliance and health economics, such asan improved side-effect profile, higher responder rates, earlier onset of actionand lower rates of relapse or recurrence. Seen from the perspective of today,the most advanced and perhaps most promising new directions are thefollowing:Neurokinin ReceptorAntagonistsNeurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists are considered to be the currentlybest validated and clinically most advanced novel approach for the treatmentof depressive disorders (Rupniak and Kramer, 1999; Rupniak, 2002; forreview see also Stoutet al., 2001). It was in 1998 when Krameret al.published that, by blocking the NK1 receptor, symptoms in patients withmajor depression could be alleviated. The compound used was MK-869, nowalso named aprepitant. In addition to its favorable effect on both anxiety andPRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY121"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"depression, the compound was described as being well tolerated and to havea more favorable side-effect profile than an SSRI. In the meantime this groupand others have published evidence that selective and brain-penetrating NK1receptor antagonists have anxiolytic and antidepressant effects also in severalanimal models (File 1997, 2000, Pappet al., 2000; Vassoutet al., 2000;Cheetaet al., 2001; Gentschet al., 2002). The race to develop and bring thefirst NK1 receptor antagonist to the market is ongoing and several majordrug companies (Merck, Pfizer, Takeda and probably others) seem to beinvolved.Corticotropin-releasing Factor-1ReceptorAntagonistsThere are many preclinical and clinical observations indicating thatabnormalities of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-related mechanismsmay underlie psychiatric disorders, especially states of anxiety anddepression (reviews by Arboreliuset al., 1999; O’Brienet al., 2001).Consequently, the concept of using selective, non-peptidic antagonists toblock overactivity in these systems as a potential antidepressant mechanismhas been put forward (Holsboer, 2000; Reul and Holsboer, 2002). Apreliminary report on an antidepressant effect seen in patients treated withthe experimental compound R121919 (Zobelet al., 2000) supports theconcept that CRF-1 receptor antagonists will develop into a novel type ofantidepressant. The compound R121919 had to be discontinued fortoxicological reasons, but better tolerated molecules probably will beidentified and eventually may represent an attractive new treatment principlefor depression.Multiple Uptake InhibitorsThe recent approach to consider compounds with a broad spectrum ofpharmacological activities rather than being very specific with regard to oneparticular neurotransmitter or mechanism aims at generating therapeuticprinciples that would provoke fewer side effects linked to one single principle ofaction (such as serotonin-related sexual or gastrointestinal side effects) andbecome first-line treatments effective with different kinds of potential under-lying disturbances (i.e. be it deficits in noradrenergic, serotonergic or othertransmitter pathways). Although these newer ‘tailored’ drugs have somesimilarity with the early, relatively unspecific tricyclic compounds, they aredevoid of the additional activities – cholinergic or histaminergic – that areheld responsible for many of the tolerability problems with the older drugs.Representatives of this new class of less-selective compounds are venlafaxineand reboxetine; a triple uptake inhibitor called duloxetine is close to approvalby health authorities.122PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Sigma LigandsAs another new approach the sigma ligands should be mentioned. Althoughthe detailed mechanism of their action remains unclear preclinically,selective sigma1 receptor agonists reduce the immobility time in the forcedswim test and tail suspension test and are, in this respect, comparable totypical antidepressants (Nodaet al., 1999). Igmesine, a selective sigma-1ligand, was reported to exert an antidepressant action (Akunneet al., 2001)and, according to Sanchez and Papp (2000), the selective sigma-2 ligand Lu28-179 has an antidepressant-like profile in the rat chronic mild stress modelof depression. For this class of compounds the proof of beneficial effects inpatients is expected to become available within the next few years.Interestingly opipramol, an old anxiolytic with pronounced antidepressantaction, has been described recently as having one of the strongestinteractions ever observed at the sigma-1 binding site (Mo ̈ller and Mu ̈ller,2001).Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)Although somewhat outside the scope of this text, a non-pharmacologicaltreatment that may become an important therapeutic tool in the futuredeserves to be mentioned within this outlook section. Initial clinical dataindicate that depressive patients are significantly improved after TMStreatment and the procedure is very well tolerated (Bermanet al., 2000;McNamaraet al., 2001). Interestingly for preclinical research, repeated TMSin rats has also been shown to have an antidepressant-like effect (Sachdevetal., 2002) in the forced swim test described later in this chapter. Whether ornot there are psychopharmacological correlates of TMS is unknown atpresent.Finally, newer technologies such as linkage studies or magnetic resonanceimaging measures have started to be applied in an attempt to elucidateadditional pathophysiological mechanisms in depression. These studies areexpected to widen our view and to increase our understanding of depression inthe years to come. One avenue currently being pursued is the proposed linkbetween an altered neurogenesis in depressive illness and its restoration duringtreatment with antidepressants (Jacobset al., 2000; Malberget al., 2000). Thisis rationally linked with the notion that stress modulates neurogenesis and thatchronic stress is very likely a causative factor for depression. Obviously thisavenue is worth pursuing further and once initial progress is made, mainly onthe preclinical side, it might lead to an entirely new treatment strategy fordepression.PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY123"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"4.3.3 HYPOTHESES RELATING TO THE MECHANISM OFACTION OFANXIOLYTICSBenzodiazepinesBenzodiazepines and a few closely related compounds are still in wide use asanxiolytics and their mechanism of action has been largely elucidated. Thesedrugs interact with GABA-A receptors and reinforce the action of theneurotransmitter GABA. Because the action of GABA is inhibitory, theGABA-related inhibition within a neural circuit is intensified in the presenceof a benzodiazepine. The particular localization of GABA neurons asinterneurons throughout almost all regions of the CNS is considered to bethe major reason why benzodiazepines are able to inhibit an excessive‘unphysiological’ stimulation only, and why the inhibition will not exceed agiven degree.Recent data from molecular biology and knockout mice studies indicate thatdifferent benzodiazepines interact differentially with several GABA-A receptorsubtypes and that a separation between sedative, muscle-relaxing andanxiolytic effects might, in principle, be achieved by the synthesis of subtype-specific molecules. If successful, this approach could help to overcome onemajor shortcoming of the benzodiazepines available today, namely the tightassociation of anxiolytic, general sedative and muscle-relaxant properties. Thisassociation is observed in clinical use with almost all known benzodiazepinederivatives, irrespective of whether they are direct agonists, partial agonists orinverse antagonists. On the other hand, benzodiazepines have one majorclinical advantage: they relieve tension and anxiety immediately rather thanfollowing a lag phase of 2–3 weeks, as seen with other classes of anxiolyticcompounds (such as SSRIs and buspirone; see Chapter 1). Thus, drugs with afast onset of anxiolytic effect but without the known disadvantages of today’sbenzodiazepines, including the tendency to induce tolerance and dependence,would be highly desirable.Beta-receptor BlockersSome of these compounds are still in clinical use, typically to treat the fear ofperforming in public, such as giving a speech, acting on stage or passing anexamination. Beta-blockers are primarily effective against the peripheralmanifestations of stress and anxiety, such as increased heart rate, sweatingand mild tremor, rather than having a major effect via the CNS. Theirclinical effectiveness is usually explained by their ability to intercept thevicious circle developing between anxiety/stress!physiological manifesta-tions of stress!perception of physiological stress reaction!increasedanxiety/stress.124PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"OutlookBased on the available (essentially preclinical), evidence, NK1 and CRF-1receptor antagonists might become alternative therapeutic approaches, notonly as antidepressants but also as anxiolytics. Given the high comorbidityof anxiety and depression, drugs with combined anxiolytic and anti-depressant effect could be of great practical value. However, beforebecoming overenthusiastic about the two relatively new pharmacologicalapproaches, clinical trials need to be performed and analyzed in order toevaluate properly the potential therapeutic benefit of the new concepts.Judging from preclinical observations, drugs interacting with some subtypesof the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) family (i.e. mGluR5antagonists or mGluR2 agonists), as well as mitochondrial benzodiazepinereceptor ligands, might also represent promising new therapeutic concepts.However, these newest classes of compounds are still at early stages ofdevelopment.4.4 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS REGARDING THEDEVELOPMENT OF NEW PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALSAll processes involved in the ‘life cycle’ of a neurotransmitter, i.e. itssynthesis, storage, release, reuptake, degradation and effects at the receptor,can be influenced and modulated by drugs. Depending on the assumeddirection of the abnormality in a given disorder, the aim is to improve thefunction of the respective neurotransmitter system, i.e. to either increase ordecrease its level of activity. Many of the conceivable possibilities atinfluencing neurotransmission are currently being used as powerful pharma-cotherapies.4.4.1 DISORDERS DUE TO HYPOFUNCTIONALITYAdministration of a PrecursorIn Parkinson’s disease there is a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in thesubstantia nigra, causing hypoactivity of dopaminergic neurotransmission dueto a lack of dopamine in the respective synapses. Because orally administereddopamine will not reach the CNS, one of the successful therapeutic approachesin Parkinson’s disease consists of substitutingL-Dopa, the biological precursorof dopamine. This treatment, via a ‘renormalization’ of the dopaminergicneurotransmission, leads to functional recovery including amelioration ofmotor capacity in Parkinson patients.PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY125"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Inhibition of a Degradating EnzymeThis approach is also applied successfully in Parkinson’s disease. Drugs such asentacapone inhibit the activity of the enzyme catechol-o-methyltransferase(COMT), which is involved in degradation of the neurotransmitter dopamine,and thus increase and prolong the availability of dopamine in the synapticcleft. Inhibition of COMT and substitution ofL-Dopa are often combined inthe therapy of Parkinson patients.Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a degeneration of neurons producingand containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, leading to hypoactivity ofthis neurotransmitter system. Inhibition of the activity of acetylcholinesterase(AChE), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine, increasesthe availability of the failing transmitter at cholinergic synapses and leads tosymptomatic improvement in many of these patients (Chapter 6). Donepezil,rivastigmine and galanthamine are drugs with this mode of action.In depression, serotoninergic and/or noradrenergic neurotransmission isassumed to be deficient. One of the approaches to increase the availability ofthese neurotransmitters is to inhibit the activity of MAO, the enzyme involvedin the degradation of serotonin and noradrenaline. Older drugs such asphenelzine and recently also moclobemide are representatives of thistherapeutic approach used in some forms of depression.Inhibition of ReuptakeAnother approach to correct neurotransmission is to inhibit the reuptake of theneurotransmitters into their presynaptic endings. If the presynaptic reuptakemechanism of a neurotransmitter is blocked then more of the neurotransmitterwill stay in the synaptic cleft and be functionally available. Many antidepressantdrugs, called ‘reuptake inhibitors’, are thought to act via this mechanism. Ifselective for serotonin they are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs, Chapter 1), but if selective for both serotonin and noradrenaline theyare called serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Most olderantidepressants, such as the tricyclic compounds amitriptyline, imipramine andclomipramine, have little specificity for any of the neurotransmitters; fluoxetine,paroxetine, citalopram and a few others are specific for serotonin; venlafaxine isa representative of the SNRIs. A more recent mixed-uptake inhibitor ismirtazepine, and some similar compounds are about to be launched.4.4.2 DISORDERS DUE TO HYPERFUNCTIONALITYBlockade of the ReceptorIn schizophrenia the dopaminergic neurotransmission is thought to beexaggerated. All known antipsychotic drugs are blockers of the dopamine126PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"D2 receptor, albeit with different specificity. Older examples of dopamineantagonists are chlorpromazine, haloperidol and many derivatives of theseprototype compounds. Newer antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone,olanzapine and quetiapine have retained this mechanism of action, althoughno longer exclusively.4.4.3 SHOULD NEW COMPOUNDS BE VERY SPECIFIC ORHAVE A BROADBAND MODE OF ACTION?When looking at the period between the early 1950s (the time when the firstpsychopharmaceuticals were discovered) and today, and trying to see what isahead, some interesting observations can be made. The early psychopharma-ceuticals, in particular the first antipsychotics and antidepressants, were notspecific pharmacologically, i.e. they interacted with various targets at the sametime. These multiple interactions were held responsible for the unfavorableside-effect profile of some early compounds. There followed a period, first withthe antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol and related compounds) and then with theantidepressants (e.g. SSRIs), when molecules with more selective mechanismsof action were put forward. These approaches had several merits and, at leastin the case of antidepressants, reflected the increasing insight into theunderlying neurochemical mechanisms of some mental disorders.On the other hand, the first really novel antipsychotic drug afterchlorpromazine – clozapine – had its origin in the late 1950s (Chapter 2) andwas by no means a transmitter-selective or target-specific compound. Similarly,the more recent atypical antipsychotic drugs, especially olanzapine, have amultitude of pharmacological actions, and the same holds true for some of thenewer antidepressants. Examples are the SNRIs and, more recently, the tripleuptake inhibitor duloxetine, a compound that concomitantly interferes with theuptake sites for serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. As noted earlier,‘multi-functional’ drugs may be expected to cause fewer transmitter system-specific side effects (such as the gastrointestinal upset and sexual dysfunctiontypical for SSRIs); in this respect, and given their potential to produce higherresponse rates, they might turn out to be superior first-line treatments. The entryinto the market of these ‘multifunctional’ agents can be seen to reflect the notionthat complex disturbances such as psychiatric disorders are more than just anaberration in one single neurotransmitter system and/or that disturbances inmore than one neurotransmitter system may lead to similar clinical syndromes.4.4.4 IS THERE A NEED FOR ‘PURE’ANTIPSYCHOTIC,ANTIDEPRESSANT OR ANXIOLYTIC DRUGS?Whereas some years ago a clear distinction was made between antipsychotic,antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs, the boundaries between these drug classesPRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY127"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"appear to have become less strict today. Thus, antidepressants – especiallySSRIs – are now frequently and successfully prescribed to patients withanxiety disorders (Chapter 1) and atypical antipsychotics are used to treatmania in the course of bipolar disorder. From a diagnostic and psychophar-macological point of view, these therapeutic strategies would appear to breakup the well-established distinction between psychotic, depressive and anxietydisorders and between antipsychotic, antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs.From a clinical viewpoint, however, these ‘transgressions’ reflect the fact thatstates of depression and anxiety have many symptoms in common and that asyndrome-orientated approach to therapy often may be more successful thanone guided by strict adherence to diagnostic categories. This view is supportedby the fact that the rate of comorbidity – the simultaneous occurrence of morethan one disorder, e.g. depression and anxiety, in the same patient at the sametime – is very high in psychiatry, which will support a ‘broadband’ therapeuticapproach provided that effective and well-tolerated drugs with a broadspectrum of activities are available.From a practical aspect, i.e. with regard to treatment compliance,convenience for the patient and drug safety, it is clearly preferable to useonly one drug with a simple dosage schedule and without the risk of druginteractions rather than a combination of two or more drugs at the same time.Broadband psychopharmaceuticals, if available, would cover this need.Finally, one should consider an economic aspect. Drug companies investmany hundred millions of euros, dollars and Swiss francs in the development ofeach new drug and it is definitely in their interest that a new compound will beused in more than one indication. A strategy often used towards this goal is tohave a new drug approved as quickly as possible for a well-defined, narrowindication and then to extend the range of indications based on the results ofadditional clinical trials (Chapter 5).If these considerations are correct it is to be expected that more broad-bandpsychopharmaceuticals will enter the market in the years to come and thatgood tolerability and ease of practical use may become more importantarguments than a specific and highly elaborate mechanism of action.For additional reading, see Internet link:http://kore.psy.du.edu/munakata/csh/neuron_minirvw_lewis&leiberman.pdf4.5 ANIMAL MODELS FOR PSYCHIATRIC INDICATIONSMechanism-related pharmacological models, e.g. attenuation or reversal of aneffect induced by an agonist by means of the respective antagonist or vice versa,as well as the so-called ‘classical models’ of psychopharmacology, i.e.interaction studies between a new compound and the effect caused by standardpsychopharmacological agents, will not be described in the following128PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"paragraphs. It should be noted, however, that these models are still widelyapplied for the characterization of compounds in development.4.5.1 SOME GENERAL COMMENTS AND PRINCIPLES REGARDINGSTUDIES WITH ANIMALSAnalogies and Homologies of Animal and Human BehaviorBehavioral pharmacology is a subdiscipline of psychopharmacology that dealswith the behavior of animals and its modulation by drugs. In the context ofbiological psychiatry, behavioral studies are used because, in analogy to man, abehavioral pattern displayed by an animal reflects its current anxiety or itswell-being, and because behavioral patterns can be quantified based onaccurate observation. A distinction is made between pure ethological studiesdescribing behavioral elements in a single animal (or representing interactionsbetween animals) such as sit, push, crawl, etc. and the more applied studiesdescribing an animal’s behavior in terms of the number or duration of activitiesdisplayed when exposed to a specific experimental environment We will dealwith the applied studies and use a few selected examples to explain some of thebasic aspects.One fundamental issue must be clarified from the beginning: there is no needto discuss whether or not a complex clinical picture of, say, depression can befound in experimental animals such as rats or mice because it cannot. However,some behavioral aspects of the multifaceted clinical picture that, followingextensive verbal communication with and observation of a patient, allow apsychiatrist to make a specific diagnosis can be seen in animals. These common(analogous) behavioral elements are studied in experimental animals. Thisstrategy also makes sense because many of our reaction patterns are,evolutionarily speaking, relatively archaic and therefore homologs or at leastanalogs to those present in species other than humans.Two examples of this commonality may suffice. First, an increase in heartrate can be seen in both animals and humans when they are exposed to athreatening situation. The common underlying mechanism is the triggering of astress reaction, which, following activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and excretion of cortisol, makes us ready for flight. Second, theavoidance of potentially dangerous situations or locations represents self-protection from being caught and occurs in both humans and animals.Observations of where people tend to walk on a pavement and where peopletend to sit in restaurants when having a free choice will illustrate this point.Most people walk close to house walls rather than in the middle of a pavementand most single visitors of restaurants tend to take a seat close to a wall,probably in order to be maximally protected and to ensure an optimal scan onwhat is happening in their immediate, new environment. This phenomenon,PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY129"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"called tigmotaxis, is also observed in animals: rats and mice avoid open areasand prefer close contact with walls.Ethical Considerations Related toAnimal ExperimentsIt is necessary continuously to ask questions about the ethical acceptability andusefulness of animal experimentation in general and, more specifically, also inbiological psychiatry. However, anyone who has ever seen a patient sufferingfrom severe mental disturbances will probably give a clear general answer: theburden of being mentally disturbed is so painful that every rational andpromising attempt to come up with better therapeutics for these patientsappears justified, even if this may entail some discomfort for experimentalanimals. Having said this, it is self-evident that animals should be treatedoptimally and used with the highest possible respect. Legislation regardinganimal protection and other rules such as the famous ‘3Rs’ (reduce, refine,replace) have to be fully respected and adequately applied. It should be addedhere that animals used for behavioral pharmacology experiments are amongthe best treated and all efforts are made in this discipline to minimize theanimals’ general level of anxiety and discomfort because it is exactly thesedimensions that are the focus of many behavioral studies.Individuality of Human Beings and AnimalsIndividuality is an accepted characteristic of human beings and it is acceptedthat each individual’s repertoire of physiological and behavioral responses maybe different and dependent upon his or her genetic background and previousexperience. Who would dare to negate that some facets of the parents aremirrored in a child, and who will disagree that types of illnesses, be theysomatic or mental, are seen with different incidences in various families ? Fordomestic animals such as cows, sheep or dogs the importance of bothenvironmental and genetic priming is also accepted: one strain of dogs is moreshy, another more aggressive, and another more social than the other, but alsowithin a strain and even within a litter one individual dog is less shy, lessaggressive or less social than other members.When it comes to laboratory animals such as rats and mice, individuality isless widely appreciated, although influences of the genetic descent, age, genderand previous experiences cannot be disputed in these animals. If one acceptsthe concept and general impact of individuality in all creatures, discussions asto whether an individual’s reactions are genetically or environmentallydetermined are no longer needed. Behavior is clearly determined by both,and then reflects individuality.130PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"4.5.2 NON-GENETICALLY-BASED ANIMAL MODELSModels of SchizophreniaAmong the animal models of schizophrenia a distinction can be made betweenpharmacological, lesion-induced and neurodevelopmental models. As is thecase with models of depression and anxiety, it will be inappropriate to describean animal with unusual behavior as suffering from schizophrenia; however, it ispossible in animals to mirror at least some of the symptoms or parametersknown to be predominant and aberrant, respectively, in schizophrenic patients.A straightforward approach to generate an animal model bearing someanalogy to schizophrenia is the administration ofpsychostimulants, i.e.compounds that can also induce psychosis-like states in healthy humans.Examples are high-dose amphetamine, ketamine and phencyclidine, i.e.compounds that in animals cause a kind of motor behavior that bears someresemblance to positive psychotic symptoms seen in patients. Thus, usingstimulant-treated rodents as screening models, compounds that specificallycounteract drug-induced hyperactivity will be identified. This is the case formost antipsychotic drugs that act primarily via blockade of dopamine D2receptors. Following administration of phencyclidine, social contact andinteraction between two treated rats is greatly disrupted. According to Sams-Dodd (1996) this may be seen as an analogy to some of the negative symptomsoccurring in schizophrenic patients, and it is hypothesized that compounds thatare able to re-establish social behavior in these animals (e.g. clozapine) have thepotential to ameliorate negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients.A characteristic disturbance in schizophrenic patients is thought to be theirinability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant stimuli due toinappropriate filtering (sensory gating) of information (Perryet al., 1999).An experimental set-up to measure this capacity is the so-calledprepulseinhibition (PPI)paradigm, which can be assessed in both human and animals.Prepulse inhibition describes the normal attenuation of a startle reflex thatoccurs when a reflex-eliciting stimulus is preceded by a weak stimulus(prepulse). Disruption of PPI as an indicator of disturbed sensory gating isconsistently observed in symptomatic schizophrenic patients (Braffet al., 1999;Cadenheadet al., 2000) and has been proposed as an operational measure ofthese patients’ inability to ignore or suppress irrelevant stimuli.A disruption of PPI can be induced in normal animals with apomorphine oramphetamine, i.e. a direct and an indirect dopaminergic agonist. This induceddisruption of PPI is reversed by dopamine antagonists, i.e. compounds knownas clinically effective antipsychotics, and thus the paradigm can be used toidentify novel compounds with potential antipsychotic activity. Interestingly,there is a strain of mouse – DBA/2 – that shows a PPI deficit even withoutbeing treated with dopaminergic agonists; this strain of mouse is now in widePRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY131"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"use as an animal model to evaluate compounds for their potential to restorePPI disruption.Another class of models is designated asneurodevelopmental. The rationaleunderlying these paradigms is that schizophrenic psychoses constitute a clinicalconsequence of wrong or suboptimal neuronal connections established duringspecific developmental stages within ontogeny. Animal models thus shouldmimic this developmental disorder. A typical approach is to administer toxicagents, e.g. the DNA-methylating agent methylazo-oxymethanol acetate(MAM), to pregnant animals (Talaminiet al., 2000): MAM interferes withcell division during development of the fetus and destroys populations ofrapidly dividing neurons. The behavioral consequences of this drug-induceddisturbance of neuronal pathways are particularly pronounced once theanimals reach puberty or adulthood. Antipsychotic drugs are expected tonormalize or attenuate abnormal behavior tested under standardized condi-tions. As for other models, it is hoped that novel types of antipsychotic drugscan be detected in this paradigm (for a review see Kilts, 2001).Models of DepressionA popular model in behavioral psychopharmacology is the so-calledforcedswim test. A rat or a mouse is placed in a cylinder filled with water and leftthere, as described in the original protocol, for 15 min. The animal initiallystruggles and swims around trying to escape from the aversive situation, but itbecomes more and more immobile during the later phase of the trial. Themotor activity displayed in this later stage is restricted to the minimumnecessary to keep the head above the water. The immobility posture acquiredat this stage is thought to reflect a kind of ‘giving up’. If removed from thewater at the end of an initial trial and re-exposed later (after 24 h or afterseveral days), an untreated (control) rat will remain in an immobility posturefor a good part of the second trial. In contrast, animals treated with a clinicallyeffective antidepressant between the two trials will be much more active (lessimmobile) throughout the second trial. Reduction of the overall immobilitytime displayed during the second exposure is considered an indication of acompound’s potential antidepressant-like effect (Fig. 4.8).The so-calledtail suspension testapplies a similar principle (Steruet al., 1985;Fujishiroet al., 2001). Instead of being immersed in water the animal (usually amouse) is suspended by its tail. Following an initial period of struggling,untreated (control) animals remain predominantly in an immobile posturewhereas animals treated immediately before the experiment with anantidepressant drug show a reduction in the time spent immobile.Another, somewhat comparable paradigm is the so-calledlearned help-lessness test. Initially the rat is confronted with mild foot-shocks from which itcannot escape. Once it has learned that there is no way to avoid the unpleasant132PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"situation the animal will become immobile. On subsequent trials, thepreviously shocked animals remain immobile even when offered the possibilityto avoid further shocks by moving to a safe, previously non-accessiblecompartment of the test box. In contrast, rats treated with clinically effectiveantidepressants will show a much higher number of escapes.The last depression model to be mentioned is thechronic mild stress model.Normal rats show a clear preference for sweet liquids rather than water. In thecurrent paradigm they are given a choice to drink, once or twice a week, eitherwater or a sucrose solution. They are then exposed, according to anunpredictable random schedule, to various mild stressors such as 24-hcontinuous light, transient individual housing or crowding, partial food orwater restriction, tilting of the cage, etc. Under these conditions the rats willdrink less and less of the normally preferred sucrose solution. This change inbehavior is thought to reflectanhedonia, an inability to enjoy pleasant stimuli,which is one of the core symptoms noted in depressed patients. If administeredan antidepressant drug, and although still exposed to stress, the animals willslowly resume drinking more of the sucrose solution and the amount consumedwill gradually regain the level seen previous to the stress period. It takes a fewweeks until the stress-induced change in drinking preference is reversed, which,in view of the similarity in time scale with clinical use of antidepressants, makesthis model attractive. Interestingly, most of the established antidepressants,irrespective of their mode of action – such as tricyclics, MAO inhibitors,SSRIs, electroconvulsive therapy andS-adenosyl-methionine or St John’sPRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY133Figure 4.8Effect of an antidepressant (imipramine) in the two-trial forced swim test inrats.

It is assumed, therefore, that the chronicmild stress model has a high predictability for a compound’s clinicalantidepressant efficacy.Models of AnxietyAnxiety Based on a Conditioned ResponseIn this category of models the animal learns a performance, typically to abstainfrom a behavior that it would normally display according to its natural andcurrent tendency. For example, in the so-calledVogel testa partly water-deprived and thirsty rat learns that, during a signaled period, every lick at thewater spout will be followed by a mild electric foot-shock. This sequenceinduces anxiety and an untreated (control) animal will abstain from drinking.However, animals pretreated with anxiolytic drugs will overcome theirinhibition and tolerate at least some of the shocks and drink even whenpunished.Anxiety Based on an Unconditioned ResponseWithin this category two classes of paradigms can be distinguished – the so-called non-social and the social ones – depending on whether a single animalor a pair (or group) of animals is being tested. An example of anunconditioned, non-social model is theelevated plus maze test,used in miceand rats and recently also in gerbils. The test is based on the observation thatrodents prefer enclosed over open environments, probably reflecting theseanimals’ tendency to protect themselves from being caught by a predator.In the elevated plus maze (EPM) a test naı ̈ve animal is given the opportunityto explore for a few minutes an environment made up of four identical arms(Fig. 4.9), two surrounded by walls (enclosed arms) and two without walls(open arms). Most rats or mice will preferentially explore the enclosed and onlyrarely enter the open arms. It is believed that in this set-up the animal is inconflict between its drive to explore the environment (there might be a potentialpartner or a preferred food source) and the avoidance of a potential threat(there might be a cat there).Depending on the animal’s level of anxiety, this conflict will be solveddifferently. An anxious animal will enter the more aversive open arms lessfrequently and for short periods only. As a measure of the animal’s currentlevel of anxiety, the ratio between the number of open arm entries over thenumber of total arm entries is calculated. A ratio of 0.15–0.30 will be found inuntreated control rats but in animals pretreated with clinically effectiveanxiolytics, such as the benzodiazepines, the ratio is close to 0.50, indicatingthat they are no longer avoiding the more aversive part of the experimental134PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"environment. Effective anxiolytics will also increase the duration of time thatrats spend on the open arms. Note that the EPM test, due to its highpracticability and ease of use, is also frequently applied to compare groups ofrodents generated by both genetic engineering and selective breeding (seebelow).There are other tests based on the same principles as those applied in theEPM, such as the light/dark box or the open-field test. In these experimentalparadigms again it is the frequency and the duration that an animal stays in themore aversive and potentially more dangerous part of the test environment(such as the illuminated part of the light/dark box or the central part of the openfield) that are recorded and, if low, reflect an animal’s higher level of anxiety.Another interesting model is the so-calledstress-induced hyperthermia test.This is based on the observation that rodents, similar to humans, show atransient increase in body temperature when something unknown is going tohappen (Lecciet al., 1990; Zethofet al., 1994). This reaction is mediated by theautonomic nervous sytem and reflects part of a stress reaction aiming at beingalert and metabolically prepared to respond to a threat. Stress is induced in agroup of mice housed in one cage by removing one animal after the other.Because the animals remaining in the cage do not know what is going tohappen to them next, they become more alert and ready to react. Theactivation manifests itself as a mild increase in body temperature (up to 1.08C)in the mice removed last compared with those removed initially (Fig. 4.10).This difference in body temperature is called stress-induced hyperthermia(SIH) and is thought to reflect an anticipatory type of anxiety. Followingpretreatment of all mice living in the same cage with an anxiolytic compound(chlordiazepoxide in the example given in Fig. 10), the body temperature of thePRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY135Figure 4.9Schematic representation of the elevated plus maze used to evaluate theanxiety of a mouse basedonits behavioralpattern displayed during aninitial exposure"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"mice removed last is increased less than in untreated animals and thetemperature in those removed initially is unaffected. This results in asignificantly attenuated SIH (0.18C in the given example) following treatmentwith a benzodiazepine. A modified SIH test (Spoorenet al., 2002) that uses lessanimals is also well applicable and sensitive to benzodiazepines and othercandidate anxiolytics.An example of an unconditioned social paradigm is the so-calledsocialinteraction testin which two animals (rats or mice) unfamiliar with one anotherare placed together in a novel environment (File, 1980, 1985, 1997, 2000). Inthis situation the two animals follow two divergent drives: to explore theenvironment (there could be a cat around) and to enter into close contact withthe unknown partner (for a male mouse it would be most attractive if thepartner were a female mouse but potentially dangerous if it were an aggressivecongener). During the initial confrontation, social contact between the twoanimals is usually minimal and this is thought to reflect the animals’ situationalinhibition or anxiety. If, however, two experimentally naı ̈ve rats, unknown toone another, are pretreated with an anxiolytic compound, the duration of timethey spend in social contact increases significantly. Thus, the model allowsquantification of the animals’ current level of anxiety (or its degree ofinhibition to engage in social activities) by measuring the duration of time136PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 4.10Anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) in the stress-inducedhyperthermia paradigm in mice"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"spent in social contact. Furthermore, the level of environmental stress can beeasily ‘titrated’ in this model by using, for example, different levels ofillumination of the test arena or a difference in familiarity between the partners.Typical anxiolytics (most studies were performed with benzodiazepines) showthe greatest efficacy under the most stressful condition (high light intensity andconfrontation with an unfamiliar partner).Another subset of models uses the confrontation with anaversive stimuluscoming from a natural enemyto trigger and assess anxiety. The most popularstimuli are real cats or objects impregnated with the odor of a cat or aningredient from fox urine (Dielenberg and McGregor, 2001). All these stimulicause an attenuation of ongoing activities, and pretreatment with anxiolyticcompounds causes rats or mice to react with less anxiety than untreatedcontrols. In the case of mice as experimental animals, the presence of a rat issufficiently stressful and produces significant behavioral inhibition.4.5.3 MODELS USING GENETICALLYALTERED ANIMALSGenetically altered animals can, in principle, be obtained in two different ways:byselective breeding, i.e. by selection and subsequent breeding of (behaviorallyor otherwise) extreme individuals within a population over several generations;and by genetic modification, i.e. by making use of recent molecular biologicaltechniques to generate strains of animals characterized by specific properties orbehaviors.Studies in Strains Obtained through Selective BreedingThe following categories of strains can be distinguished:(1) Strains showing relevance to psychiatric disturbances, although originallybred for some physical peculiarity. An example are Wistar Kyoto (WKY)rats, i.e. normotensive rats originally considered only as normotensivecontrols to spontaneously hypertensive rats. The WKY rats display lowmotor activity, increased immobility in the forced swim test and abnormalsleep patterns and, based on their behavior, are being used as an animalmodel of depression (Pare and Redei, 1993; Solberget al., 2001). An earlystudy (Gentschet al., 1981) had also indicated that WKY rats haveincreased emotionality, i.e. attenuated activity in the open field and anincreased defecation rate. Attempts are being made to breed behaviorallyextreme WKY rats to increase further the potential of this model ofdepression.(2) Strains originally bred for their differential sensitivity towards anexperimental manipulation or a pharmacological agent, andsubsequently recognized to be potential models of psychiatric disorders:PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY137"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"examples are the Flinders sensitive (FSL) and Flinders resistant (FRL)lines. The FSL rats show depression-like behavioral patterns, e.g. in theforced swim test (Overstreetet al., 1995). Another example are rats moreor less sensitive to the effects of apomorphine: when challenged with thisdopamine agonist some rat strains display more severe alterations thanothers in a problem-solving test, with the more susceptible strains thoughtto be a partial model of schizophrenia (Coenderset al., 1992; Ellenbroeket al., 1995).(3) Strains selected for differences in learning performance – Roman highavoidance (RHA) versus Roman low avoidance (RLA). In addition to thedifferent performances displayed on the acquisition of an active avoidancetask (RHA > RLA rats) these two strains have been described to differ inemotionality/level of anxiety (RHA < RLA) (e.g. Gentschet al., 1988).(4) Strains selected and selectively bred for their behavior in the elevated plusmaze, reflecting animals’ anxiety upon being exposed to a novelenvironment. Two strains of rats, named the high anxiety line (HAL)and the low anxiety line (LAL), represent a very interesting examplebecause it has been shown that the CRF-1 receptor antagonist R121919was anxiolytic in rats with a high degree of innate anxiety, whereas thesame compound was ineffective in rats with low anxiety (Kecket al., 2001).This is reminiscent of experimental situations in humans where anxiolyticcompounds are almost ineffective when taken by non-anxious persons(Janke and Debus, 1968).Selective breeding often results in strains that drift bidirectionally from theoriginal population. Any difference within such a pair of extremes needs to beinterpreted with caution because at least in some of the available examples it isdisputable which of the two sub-lines is more deviant from normality, i.e. fromthe original strain. With the inclusion of the appropriate control (normal)animals, selective breeding still remains an attractive approach because theindividuals represent the extremes of the original (normal) population, thisbeing quite analogous to some human psychopathologies.Strains Derived from Direct Manipulations of the Genetic BackgroundGeneral Considerations(1) The emergence of gene technological methods during the last decade hasextended the scope of animal experimentation dramatically. Older, time-consuming approaches to influence the characteristics of animalpopulations, which were based on spontaneous mutations (chanceevents) and subsequent selective breeding, are being superseded by newertechnologies that allow direct and specific intervention with the genetic set-138PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"up of living beings. Rather than criticizing and being worried about thesenovel technologies, one should consider that selection and subsequentbreeding of special forms of individuals represents a strategy that has beenapplied for many centuries. More productive animals as well as manydesired types and forms of plants and flowers were created in the past bymeans of selective breeding, i.e. a genetics-based but unfocussed approach.(2) The possibility of studying the involvement of genetic factors in mentaldisorders directly has a major impact on preclinical investigations relatedto mental disorders. With the availability of newer technologies frommolecular biology, genetic aspects can be studied in much more detail byusing genetically modified experimental animals such as knockout strains(animals in which a gene has been removed) or overexpressing strains (inwhich replicates of a gene are present). Owing to practical reasons,genetically modified mice are used more frequently than transgenic orknockout rats. These studies are heuristically supported by the fact that thegenomes (see Box 4.3 for explanation of terms used in genetics) of mice andhumans are remarkably similar (Muralet al., 2002): as an example, of the731 genes contained in chromosome 16 of the mouse, only 14 could not beidentified in the human genome. This similarity supports the concept thatgene-targeting models in mice will produce valuable information aboutgene-mediated aspects of mental disturbances in humans.Box 4.3 Definitions used in the Field of GeneticsGenetics: The field of science dealing with the molecular basis andunderlying mechanisms of inherited characteristics and theirtransition to subsequent generationsGene: A distinct sequence on the DNA strain that encodes for apeptideDNA:Deoxyribonucleicacid isthe repository of hereditarycharacteristics.

It is estimated thatthere are some 3 million minimal variations, so-called singlenucleotide polymorphisms, which may determine whether a patientis a responder or not to a drug or is less or more susceptible to drugside effects. Thus, in order to provide optimally effective treatment,it would be of value to know an individual’s genetic pattern beforeinitiating drug therapy. This possibility is still far from routine use,but genetic scanning of entire populations also has the aim toidentify genetic markers that could be used as diagnostic tools topredict patients’ reactions to a particular drug.Genomic approach: Determination of alterations in the geneticmake-up of patients, aimed at identifying altered gene sequences inorder to predict the individual risk of contracting a specific illness.Proteomic approach: Whereas the genomic approach focusses onthe analysis of genetic material, the proteomic approach concen-trates on the pattern of proteins present in patients.14 0PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"(3) It has long been known that the risk for specific psychiatric disorders ismuch higher in some families than in others, indicating a genetic mediationof these disorders. Combined epidemiological and genetic studies mightshed further light on the genetic predisposition for some disorders, andentire populations are currently being screened for the presence of indicatorgenes. A well-known example is a screening program for genetic indicatorscomprising the population of Iceland; according to preliminaryinformation, 13 candidate genes for CNS disorders have been identified,among them also some genes associated with stroke and schizophrenia.(4) The advances in large genetic screening studies are paralleled andsupported by the dramatic increase in computer capacity and advancesin semiconductor technology. So-called gene chips and microarrays makeit possible to scrutinize, on a single glass slide of one square centimeter,details of the entire genome of an organism. Two chips are sufficient for thehuman genome! By comparing the pattern of activated genes between, forexample, depressed patients and healthy persons, information on activatedor inactivated genes in depressive disorder can be gathered. Existing andpotential new therapeutic principles then can be tested for their potentialto turn on or shut down the activity of selected genes. This approach isexpected to generate relevant information on genetic correlates of mentaldisorders; it may also provide answers to currently unresolved questions,such as why some patients respond to treatment with a given drug whereasother patients do not. Once it is more developed and refined, this approachmay lead to individually tailored treatments for mental illnesses. It mayalso help to shed new light on the trait versus state issue, i.e. whether agiven genetic constellation (the activity pattern of certain genes) is presentin a patient all the time (‘trait marker’), or only at times when clinicalsymptoms are manifest (‘state marker’). In the former, prophylactictreatment could be appropriate, but in the latter, a more interventivetherapeutic procedure would probably be chosen.Two typical gene-modified strains of mice that are currently used inpharmacological studies will now be described.Corticotropin-releasing-factor (CRF)-over expressing MiceCorticotropin releasing factor is a 41-amino-acid-containing peptide. Itsphysiological role is to trigger the release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH),which in turn causes the release of cortisol – a stress hormone released in largequantities during any stress exposure. Once released, cortisol makes anorganism ready to react by increasing the heart rate and turning on severalmetabolic processes; as a consequence of the stress reaction the individualbecomes alert and, as evidenced in animals, ready to fight or flight.PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY141"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Under normal conditions a stress reaction is shut off once the stimulus, e.g.an enemy or some other situation perceived as dangerous, has disappeared. If,however, due to any possible reason, the level of cortisol is not decreasing to itsbaseline level, one speaks of a hypercortisolemic state that, if chronified, cancause harm to an organism and ultimately may lead to physiological damage.Many chronically anxious or depressed patients are in a hypercortisolemicstate.The CRF-overexpressing mice are a genetically engineered strain with morethan the normal number of copies of the CRF-encoding gene inserted in theirgenome. Compared with their wild-type counterpart, these animals showincreased anxiety; they also have some of the abnormalities seen inhypercortisolemic patients, such as adrenal hypertrophy, marked thymusinvolution and increased abdominal fat (Beckmannet al., 2001). They haveincreased blood levels of cortisol and represent an animal model ofhypercortisolemia (Stenzel-Pooreet al., 1992, 1994; Holmes, 2001).Neurokinin-1Receptor Knockout MiceNeurokinins are small peptides that participate in the modulation of manyphysiological processes. One neurokinin, called substance P, predominantlyacts as an agonist at neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors. The distribution ofsubstance P and NK1 receptors in the organism suggests an involvement inphysiological processes and subjective symptoms such as inflammation, emesispain, migraine and gastrointestinal discomfort. Substance P is also located inbrain regions involved in the regulation of emotions, such as the amygdala andthe septum, and newer studies with specific NK1 receptor antagonists in rats,mice and gerbils indicate that this class of compounds may have anxiolyticpotential (File, 2000; Vassoutet al., 2000; Cheetaet al., 2001; Gentschet al.,2002). Based on these findings it was anticipated that studies in animals lackingNKl receptors (so-called NK1 receptor knockout mice) would provideadditional information about the relevance of this receptor. Such animalshave now been generated and are reported to be less anxious than controlanimals (Santarelliet al., 2001). These and other experimental findings suggestthat the physiological consequence of shutting down the NK1 receptors byeither knocking out this receptor or completely blocking it by means of apotent, selective and centrally active NK1 receptor antagonist will be identical.It is anticipated that NK1 receptor antagonists will turn out to be of clinicaluse in anxiety syndromes.A Possible Limitation of Genetically Engineered Experimental AnimalsIt is thought that CNS receptors in man have normal function most of the timebut may lose some of their normal function transiently, a loss that will translate142PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"clinically into symptoms of anxiety, depression, etc. In contrast, knockoutanimals do not have the respective receptor at any time in their life, includingthe various developmental stages. This permanent deficiency is likely to affectall functions normally controlled by the receptor during ontogenesis. Thus, inan attempt to come closer to the (hypothetical) clinical situation, more recentpreclinical approaches aim at generating so-called conditional knockouts, i.e.animals with transiently inactivated receptors during a specific developmentalperiod or at a certain age only.To conclude this paragraph it should be stated that modifications in anycreature’s genetic background must be made with respect and should alwaysinclude ethical considerations, because scientifically interesting but physiolo-gically harmful mutations can be created by these interventions. Closeevaluation of vital functions and observation of the behavior of any newtype of animal created by genetic engineering will help to avoid unnecessary orinappropriate suffering of any newly established population. Interested readersare referred to a recent article by Cryanet al.(2002), which summarizesgenetically modified strains of mice currently used as models in anxiety- anddepression-directed experimental research.4.6 FINAL COMMENTThere will be many new challenges ahead of those working in the field ofpsychopharmacology. However, the development of new ideas and conceptsin the future should not be guided exclusively by scientific interest, aimingsolely at understanding the complex mechanisms involved in our normal andpathological feelings and emotions. The dedication to come up with betterdrugs for patients suffering from mental disorders should remain the primegoal of all our efforts. Thereby – and note that this is mentioned here by abehavioral pharmacologist – clinicians and particularly the patients mighttell us best which directions psychopharmacology should take in its efforts totry to alleviate the burden of mental disorders. Needless to say that tightinterdisciplinary contact, as it traditionally exists in neuropsychopharmacol-ogy, will ultimately decide whether we succeed together in our mission tohelp suffering patients to overcome their disturbance and attain fullremission.Acknowledgment:I am grateful to Albert Enz for having created Fig. 4.2 and for his criticalreading of the manuscript.PRECLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY143"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Additional Information onTopics in this Chapter.Glossary of concise definitions of terms covering the various aspects ofmedicinal chemistry:http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/medchem/cont.html.References and further reading on depression, antidepressants and mood-brighteners:http://www.biopsychiatry.com/refs/index.html.References and further reading on anxiety, anxiety medications, anxiolytics:http://www.fpnotebook.com/PSY15.htm.Internet Mental Health, a free encyclopedia of mental health informationcreated by a Canadian psychiatrist, Dr Phillip Long:http://www.mentalhealth.com/.Information from the National Institute of Mental Health (USA)http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/index.cfm.Daily updated information on health aspects provided by news channels:http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/living/Periodicals Reporting on Original Contributions within theField (in Alphabetical Order).Behavioral Brain Research.Brain Research.European Journal of Pharmacology.Journal of Affective Disorders.Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.Pharmacogenomics.Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior.Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA.Psychopharmacology.Psychiatry Research.Schizophrenia Research.Science144PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"5Clinical Research inPsychopharmacologyByFERENC MARTENYI5.1 INTRODUCTORY CONSIDERATIONSClinical research involves sick persons and aims ultimately at improvingexisting treatments and discovering new and better ones. Questions ofdiagnosis and classification of diseases, as well as parts of basic medicalresearch, also come under the heading of clinical research insofar as theyconcern the study of causes and mechanisms of diseases and their symptoms inhumans. In psychiatry, clinical research in the sense of therapy researchincludes pharmacotherapeutic and non-pharmacological therapeuticapproaches. This chapter deals exclusively with research on drug treatments.The search for new psychopharmaceuticals lies largely in the hands ofpharmaceutical companies and is thus strongly influenced by commercial interests.During the development of new compounds, these companies work closely withuniversities and other research institutes, and later with doctors and psychologistsin clinics, hospitals and private practices. This cooperation is supervised todifferent degrees by the state or regional authorities in different countries.As a rule, drug companies have aresearch and development (R&D) portfolio,i.e. a more or less well-defined collection of short- and long-term scientificprojects. With the progress of medicinal sciences and changes in thepharmaceutical markets, the R&D portfolio undergoes regular revisions.Typical questions at the time of portfolio revision may be:Psychopharmacology, Fourth Edition.

Because decisionsconcerning the R&D portfolio will tie up personnel and financial resources foryears, they are of highest relevance to the company as a whole. In order to limitthe risk, most companies compile a portfolio of R&D projects that includes amixture of long-term and short-term, partly conservative and partly high-riskR&D areas.Once the R&D portfolio is determined, questions regarding a specificresearch strategyneed to be approached, such as:.How is a specific objective within the R&D portfolio, e.g. the search foranxiolytic drugs with a fast onset of action (like benzodiazepines) butlacking cognitive side effects and addictive potential (unlike benzodiaze-pines), to be partitioned and sequenced so that individual groups withinR&D, with their different approaches and methods, can be integratedsensibly into the project?.Which areas are preferably dealt with inside the company, with its ownR&D know-how, and which sub-projects should be farmed out to externalorganizations such as other research companies, biotech companies oruniversity institutes?.How many compounds from a given chemical class, with a givenpharmacological profile and starting from a given hypothesis should bedeveloped and taken up to clinical testing?146PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Unlike the R&D portfolio, which forms part of business policy, questions ofthis type are usually discussed and decided upon not by the company topmanagement but within the specialist divisions.When an interesting compound or series of compounds is identified inpreclinical R&D, a clinical development strategy needs to be agreed upon. Akey element of this process is the definition of atarget product profile(TPP).The TPP contains a comprehensive product description of the new drug, whichreflects its potential therapeutic uses (indications) based on informationregarding the preclinical pharmacokinetic profile, the expected route ofadministration, the receptor-affinity profile, data from animal models, etc.The TPP needs to consider the potential advantages and disadvantages of thenew drug based on preclinical efficacy and safety findings. Positioning of thenew drug in relation to existing treatment and differentiation from othermolecules with the same or similar indication are essential elements of the TPP.The TPP follows the structure of the package insert; it is an evolving anddynamic version of the expected drug labeling that is used and modified duringthe entire drug development process. The TPP drives the development plan: itdetermines the orientation, size and other specifics of clinical trials to supportthe predicted profile of the drug. The TPP, together with the clinicaldevelopment strategy, represents a flexible learning-by-results system: theresults of clinical trials confirm or challenge the TPP.At this level a number ofmethodological issuesconcerning clinical researchneed to be addressed:.Stratification of targeted indication and patient population..Objectives and hypotheses for sequences of individual experimental andclinical studies..Statistical planning of individual studies anda prioridetermination ofstatistical methods..Selection of patient samples: definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria..Definition of the levels of assessment, evaluation criteria and measurementinstruments..Duration of treatment and dosage of the experimental product andreference substances.A challenging situation arises when a substance possessing a ‘high degree ofinnovation’ is to be tested clinically. Such compounds would be derived fromas yet relatively unknown chemical classes, with the mechanism of action notestablished so far; they would have shown a qualitatively novel profile of actionduring animal experiments or would have been tested using methods aboutwhich little was known to date. In circumstances such as these, thepharmacological hypothesis must be tested in specifically designed proof-of-concept (PoC) trials before large efficacy and safety trials are undertaken inPhases II and III.CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY147"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Regulatory requirements predefine in many ways the preclinical and clinicaldevelopment of new compounds. The US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) requires primarily two positive, independent, adequately powered,placebo-controlled clinical trials supporting the indications of a newantidepressant, antipsychotic or antimanic compound. In this special regardthe European regulations are different: the European Medicines EvaluationAgency (EMEA) primarily requires data about the non-inferiority of a newpotential psychotropic drug compared with an existing standard treatment.European regulations are asking for maintenance data as well, even in the caseof a short-term treatment claim.The clinical study of a new substance proceeds in several steps or phases. Thepurpose of this subdivision is to minimize the risk to the participating subjectsand patients at each point in time and to allow each individual part of the studyto flow one from the other so that a maximum of information from one trialcan be obtained for the following studies.5.2 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF CLINICAL RESEARCH INPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY5.2.1 GENERAL REMARKSThe mission of clinical research is to provide scientifically appropriate andaccurate information about new treatments in patients, keeping the safety ofthe patient as absolute priority; referring to the law of Hippocrates: ‘‘Nilnocere’’ (Not to harm). An additional ethical aspect of clinical research is thedemand of high scientific standards. Therefore ‘‘...at thestart of the trial,there must be a state of clinical equipoise regarding the merits of the regimensto be tested, and the trial must be designed in such a way as to make itreasonable to expect that, if it is successfully conducted, clinical equipoise willbe disturbed’’ (Freedman, 1987).Research in the field of mental illnesses raises specific ethical challenges thatderive from the unique aspect of psychiatric disorders and from the personaland social consequences of often stigmatizing, chronic, debilitating and manytimes life-threatening diseases. It is difficult to estimate the impact ofmental diseases on the socio-economic dimension (Chapter 9). One infour people worldwide will suffer from a mental or neurological disorder atsome point during their lifetime. It is estimated that more than 120 millionpeople worldwide suffer from major depression and some 24 million fromschizophrenia at any time. Unipolar major depression is now the leading causeof disability globally and ranks fourth in the causes of global burden of disease;it is forecasted to be the second disease in 2020 in terms of socio-economic148PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"burden, expressed by disability adjusted life years (DALY; World HealthOrganization, 2001).As in other domains of medicine, there is an unabated demand for new,more efficacious psychiatric drug treatment with a better tolerability and side-effect profile. But is it really desirable to add further to the long list ofpsychopharmaceuticals with their often similar properties of actions? Thisquestion certainly must be answered in the affirmative for several psychiatricindications because there is a perceived lack of:.Antipsychotic drugs without extrapyramidal action and not causing othermedical or tolerability problems after short- and long-term use..Antidepressants with fast onset of action and a broader spectrum of efficacyin both unipolar and bipolar depression..Anxiolytics with fast onset of action but not causing sedation or leading todrug dependency..Mood stabilizers with antimanic and antidepressive efficacy, preventingaffective episodes in different types of bipolar disorder from occurring, withconsiderably better tolerability than lithium..More effective drugs for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral disordersoccurring in the elderly.Given the need for development and clinical testing of novel drugs in patients,and the right of each patient to benefit from optimal treatment, there isobviously a conflict of purposes in clinical research that has been and still isevaluated differently at different times and under different circumstances.Opinion today is that a patient should, whenever possible, be the master of hisown fate and not be delivered defenseless to the doctor – an opinion that hasbeen reflected in laws and guidelines.5.2.2 PROTECTING THE PATIENTMedical activity is covered, on the one hand, by national civil and criminal lawand, on the other hand, by what are known as medical ethics. These arestandards of behavior that govern the doctor’s dealings with his patients andby which every doctor should feel himself bound. The Hippocratic oath ispart of the medical code of ethics that has been extended further over thepast 30 years, particularly in view of clinical research. The 18th WorldMedical Association Conference in 1964 passed the Declaration of Helsinki,containing recommendations intended to guide physicians engaged inbiomedical research on human subjects. This Declaration was revised in1975 in Tokyo, in 1989 in Hong Kong, in 1996 in South Africa and in 2000in Edinburgh (see p. 325 ff., and the homepage of the World MedicalAssociation:www.wma.net/e/policy/17-c_e.html).CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY149"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Four major elements act as a safeguard for patients participating in clinicaltrials:(1)The knowledge, expertise and integrity of the investigators. Only highlyqualified, experienced experts are able to generate high-quality data withscientific impact. Beyond scientific and clinical experience, a professionalcommitment related to regulations and basic ethical principles ofbiomedical research is required. Knowledge of Good Clinical Practiceguidelines (see Box 5.1) is requested from investigators.Box 5.1 Principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP)‘‘Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and scientificquality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and report-ing trials that involve the participation of human subjects.Compliance with the standard provides public assurance that therights, safety, and well-being of the trial subject are protec-ted. . . .

Only voluntary participation in a study is acceptable, andpatients (participants) must have the right to withdraw from a study at anytime.(3)Accurate information of study participants resulting in ‘informed consent’.This process is intended to provide comprehensive information to studyparticipants (or their legal representative), allowing them to make aninformed decision about participation or non-participation in a clinicaltrial. The details of the investigational procedures must be explained: e.g.the randomization and allocation of treatments, placebo lead-in, washout,frequency of visits, experimental paradigms, challenge maneuvers,restrictions related to concomitant medication, the nature ofmedications, potential side effect(s) of the active treatment(s) and thepotential hazard of placebo treatment. All explanations must betransparent, written in an easy-to-understand language. In the case ofadditional questions related to the trial protocol, an additionalindependent expert has to give the detailed explanation.(4)Institutional Review Boards. In university clinics and other hospitalsengaged in research, ethics committees (also called Institutional ReviewBoards, IRBs) have been formed over the last three decades to monitorclinical research activities from scientific, legal, ethical and socialviewpoints. All protocols relating to clinical trials must be submitted tothese committees, which are generally made up of one or several doctors, alawyer, a representative of the nursing staff and also communityrepresentatives such as priests. This composition forces clinicalresearchers to set out their intentions in such a way as to be clearenough for a lay person to understand and to assess whether theinconvenience and risks involved for the patient are in a reasonablerelationship to the possible benefit of the planned trial.A basic ethical issue in several areas of psychiatric research is whetherparticipants are able to provide informed consent, particularly for protocolsentailing medication washout and/or placebo treatment. The majority ofpsychiatric patients who are asked to participate in clinical trials have adequatecapacity to provide consent. Thus, in a study specifically designed to examinethe capacity of schizophrenic patients to give informed consent, cognitivedysfunction and negative symptoms (apathy and avolition), but not psychoticsymptoms (hallucinations, delusions), were found to be associated withimpaired decisional capacity (Moseret al., 2002). These features are probablynot unique to schizophrenia but are likely to apply to many other forms ofillness.CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY151"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"When a clinical trial involving placebo or no-treatment control (see Box 5.2)is undertaken, the researcher and the IRB are obliged to ensure that patients orauthorized third parties are fully informed about any therapy withdrawn orwithheld for purposes of the research project, about the anticipatedconsequences of withdrawing or withholding the therapy and about thereasons why investigators deem a placebo-controlled trial to be necessary.Box 5.2 Issues of Placebo Control in Clinical TrialsUse ofplacebo controlsin clinical trials is judged differently by thehealth authorities of different countries. Most Institutional ReviewBoards in Europe are reluctant or even negative about allowingplacebo-controlled trials in cases where accepted and establishedtreatment is available for the respective disease – which isobviously the case for major depression, schizophrenia or bipolardisorder. The US point of view differs (Laughren, 2001). A majorconcern with regard to placebo-controlled trials is the potentialincrease of suicidality, which represents a high risk both in majordepression and in schizophrenia. However, analysis of suicidalitydata from eight placebo-controlled trials in depressive patients andfour studies in schizophrenic patients failed to support thehypothesis of increased risk of suicide in patients on placebocompared with the standard treatments or the investigational newcompounds used in these studies. On the other hand the failure rate(about 50%) of placebo-controlled trials in depression, even forestablished compounds, would argue in favor of placebo-controlledstudies to provide scientifically valid data about efficacy. The ratioof failed trials in placebo-controlled studies with establishedantipsychotic treatment is lower (about 25%), providing a reasonto consider the possible validity of a non-inferiority design in thiscondition (Laughren, 2001).Ethically motivated opponents consider trials with placebocontrol unacceptable if and when standard therapies or interven-tions are available for a particular patient population. Accordingly,placebo-controlled trials would be permitted only in the followingcircumstances:.If there is no standard treatment or if standard therapy has beenshown to be no better than placebo..If evidence has arisen creating substantial doubt regarding thenet therapeutic advantage of standard therapy (e.g. due to sideeffects).152PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":".If effective treatment is not available to patients due to costconstraints or short supply (however, a placebo-controlled trialis not permissible when effective but costly treatment is madeavailable to the rich but remains unavailable to the poor oruninsured).Placebo-controlled trials also can be considered in the followingcircumstances:.In a population of patients who are refractory to standardtreatment and for whom no standard second-line treatmentexists..When testing add-on treatment to standard therapy, assumingthat all subjects in the trial receive all treatments that wouldnormally be prescribed..If patients have provided an informed renunciation of standardtherapy for a minor condition for which patients commonlyrefuse treatment, and when withholding such therapy will notlead to undue suffering or the possibility of irreversible harm ofany magnitude.5.3 BASICS OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY5.3.1 THE BASIC OF BASICS: CORRECT DIAGNOSIS AND PATIENTSELECTIONA fundamental aspect in clinical psychopharmacological research is theprecision (reliability) and accuracy (validity) of a particular diagnosis given to apatient. Validity in this context is the ability of a diagnosis to allow accuratedecisions during a study (inclusion or exclusion of patients according to thecriteria specified in the protocol; judgments as to the onset of the disease, ofimprovement or remission; differentiation of the symptoms of the disorderfrom potential adverse events of the treatment). Reliability is the ability of adiagnostic procedure to provide consistent results. It depends on the skills ofthe investigator how patient interviews are being performed, under whatconditions the patients are interviewed and how the answers given by thepatient are interpreted (interrater reliability). The validity and reliability ofdiagnosis affect all aspects of a clinical study in psychopharmacology. Invaliddiagnoses will lead to inappropriate inclusion or exclusion of patients in a trial,and the findings may simply be wrong, possibly biasing all conclusions from astudy. On the other hand, if diagnoses are valid but not reliable (precise),CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY153"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"signals coming from a study are blurred (Kraemer, 1994). Thus, low diagnosticreliability decreases the power of a trial and larger sample sizes will be neededto detect differences between treatments.Making a diagnosis is a more complex task than just the detection of adisorder. A disorder represents a pathophysiological abnormality, manifestedin mental and/or physical symptoms. Diagnosis considers patients within amore complex, multiaxial system that is the essential concept of the DSM-IVsystem. The DSM-IV provides a comprehensive approach to evaluate patientsaccording to: pathological mental conditions (clinical disorder)¼Axis I;personality disorders/mental retardation¼Axis II; general medical condi-tion¼Axis III; psychosocial and environmental problems¼Axis IV; globalassessment of functioning¼Axis V (APA, 1994). A diagnosis in this regard is acomposite of the disorder of the patient (A), characteristics of the patientirrespective of the current disorder, i.e. possible contaminants such aseducation, rural or non-rural status, civil status, employed or not employed(B), and random error (C). Sources of random error are inconsistencies inpatient reports, diurnal variation of symptoms, observational errors of theinvestigator, etc. The diagnosis of a patient represents the sum of all thesefactors: diagnosis¼A+B+C. The validity or accuracy of diagnoses in asample of patients can be defined as:AAþBþCThe reliability or precision of the diagnosis for a group of patients represents:AþBAþBþCIn this sense one can speak only about the validity and reliability of diagnosesin a population of patients. Reliability is always greater than validity. Areliable diagnosis can be invalid but an unreliable diagnosis cannot be valid.In clinical trials patients are selected according to a number of inclusion andexclusion criteria. Selection criteria in a clinical trial consist of:.The specific diagnosis according to a diagnostic system (DSM-IV, ICD-10or other established classification instrument)..Patient selection based on symptom severity. This can be defined directly bya minimal acceptable severity score as measured by a rating instrument (e.g.the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Positive and NegativeSymptom Scale or other established assessment instruments; see Section5.6). An indirect definition of symptom severity may be a consequence of thestatus of a patient population: a clinical trial designed for inpatientsgenerally implies a more severe symptom profile than a study with154PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"outpatients. Involvement of outpatients in a study usually excludes theupper range of severity of the patient population..The previous course of a disorder and its resolution with treatment can be akey element of patient selection. Investigation of the effects of a drug inde novodiagnosed, first-episode patients will lead to different conclusionsthan a trial in mainly chronic, multitreatment-exposed patients. Some keyinclusion criteria can be defined according to the treatment response historyof patients; a study with clozapine in ‘‘treatment resistant schizophrenicpatients’’ (Kaneet al., 1988; see Chapter 2) is an example for this..Exclusion criteria limit the sample of the trial by the segregation of patients:those who may contribute undue risk to a trial, such as potential high-riskpatients (due, for example to suicidality) or patients with severe somaticcomorbidity or special Axis II comorbidity (e.g. antisocial personalitydisorder); and those who are affecting the potential effect size of theinvestigated compound (e.g. treatment-resistant patients, patients exposedto adequate treatment within a predefined time frame or patients sufferingfrom drug abuse).Although narrow inclusion and extensive exclusion criteria may increase theinternal validity of a study, results of a very ‘clean’ trial become lessgeneralizable. Thus, at the very beginning of a clinical development, highlycontrolled PoC trials strive for high levels of homogeneity mainly by extensiveexclusion criteria. In contrast, an important goal of so-called naturalisticstudies (which are characteristic of late stages of clinical drug development) isto collect information about the efficacy and safety aspects of pharmacologicalinterventions in a broader patient population not limited by overly strictexclusion criteria.5.3.2 PHARMACOKINETIC^PHARMACODYNAMIC ASPECTS OFCLINICAL TRIALSThis section deals with the question of whether there are quantitativelydetectable and interpretable correlations between the dose of an administereddrug, or the concentration of a drug and its metabolites measured in the bloodor plasma (blood or plasma level), and the therapeutic action or side effectsobserved. Investigations relating to questions of this type are called PK–PD(pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic) studies. The PK–PD analysis is abidirectional approach: pharmacokinetics represent what the body does witha drug, and pharmacodynamics describes what a drug does to the body. ThePK–PD analyses are key elements of early drug development, and PK–PDtrials are able to answer specific disease-related efficacy and safety questions.CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY155"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Basic Pharmacokinetic terms and modelsPharmacokineticsis a discipline that uses mathematical models to describe andpredict the time course of drug concentrations in body fluids. Methods forquantitative analysis of drug concentrations in plasma and tissues arenowadays highly sensitive and specific. For some psychotropic drugs, theranges of therapeutic and potentially toxic plasma concentrations are reason-ably well established; for others, such ranges are tentatively established orpostulated. Owing to the different blood–brain penetration parameters,pharmacokinetic data of molecules measured in blood do not necessarilyreflect the psychotropic (central nervous system) effects.Pharmacodynamics–the study of the quality, intensity and time course of drug effects on theorganism – has also undergone major changes, largely due to technologicaladvances in our capacity to measure drug effects. So-called kinetic–dynamicmodeling uses mathematical methods to link drug concentrations directly toclinical effects (Fig. 5.1).The most important processes assessed in pharmacokinetic studies areabsorption(uptake of a drug from the digestive tract),distribution(compart-mentalization in the body),metabolism(conversion or breakdown, especially inthe liver) andelimination(excretion), summarized by the abbreviation ADME.The time elapsed from ingestion of a drug until peak concentrations (Cmax)are reached in the blood or plasma is calledtmax. The elimination half-life (t1/2)is the interval betweentmaxand the time at which the remaining concentrationamounts to 50% of the previously achievedCmax. In the case of drugs thatproduce their intended effect after a single dose, such as hypnotics, the relevantpharmacokinetic properties differ from those of medication that has to betaken repeatedly over a longer time (such as antipsychotics, mood stabilizersand antidepressants). Thus, assuming that the pharmacokinetic featurescoincide in time with the pharmacodynamic properties of a drug, an optimalhypnotic should have a shorttmaxand a shortt1/2, i.e. a fast onset of action anda fast decline. In the case of antipsychotics and antidepressants,tmaxis lessimportant andt1/2should be 12 or more hours so that no more than one ortwo drug doses are required each day. Typicalt1/2values for antidepressantsare 12–50 h, and it takes about four to five half-lives to reach a stableconcentration or ‘steady-state’ concentration (Css) after repeated administra-tion. Therapeutic plasma level monitoring, e.g. for compliance control, issensible only under steady-state conditions (Fig. 5.2).Drugabsorptionis influenced by many biological and physiological factorswithin an organism. The membrane of the gastrointestinal epithelial cellsis composed of a phospholipid bilayer interspersed with proteins. Thetranscellular passage of a drug depends on itssolubilityin water and itspermeability characteristics to penetrate the lipid bilayer of the epithelial cellmembrane, which in turn is dependent on thelipophilicityof the drug156PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"molecules. As an example, absorption of barbiturates increases with higherlipophilicity as a result of better membrane penetration. The lipophiliccharacter of the central nervous system (CNS)-acting drugs has an additionalaspect: it is a critical feature in the penetration of theblood–brain barrierbecause all psychotropic drugs must be able to diffuse passively from the bloodto the brain.Because the entire blood supply of the upper gastrointestinal tract passesthrough the liver before reaching the systemic circulation, a drug may bemetabolized by the gut wall and the liver during its first passage of drugCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY157Figure 5.1Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the psychotropic drugs in thebody.

In general, the higher the lipophilicity of adrug, the better its permeability and the greater its first-pass metabolism andhence its metabolic clearance.Pharmacokinetic Metabolic StudiesThere is no specificity for CNS compounds in the design of pharmacokineticand metabolic studies, which should provide information about the ADMEcharacteristics of a new drug (see Box 5.3). An important part ofpharmacokinetic investigations is the exploration of drug metabolism.Biotransformation is a critical step during the metabolism of endogenousligands (e.g. hormones, neurosteroids) and drugs. Cytochrome P-450(CYP450) enzymes are heme-containing proteins that occur predominantly inthe liver and to a lesser extent in the small intestine, kidney and adrenals. TheCYP450 enzymes are responsible for the deactivation of active compounds orthe transformation of psychopharmacologically inactive molecules (so-calledparent compounds) into active molecules. A classification system has beendeveloped in which each P-450 is assigned a family, subfamily and number. Forexample, CYP2D6 stands for family 2, subfamily D and gene 6. Theimportance of the P-450 enzymes to psychopharmacology follows from thefact that they mediate most of Phase I drug metabolism.158PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 5.2Plasma concentration curve of drug after single and repeated administration:Css max, maximal steady-state plasma concentration after repeated administration;Css av,average steady-state concentration after repeated administration;Css min, minimal steady-state concentration after repeated administration;Csd max, maximal plasma concentrationafter single oral dose;tsd max, time to maximal concentration after single oral dose;tsd1=2,plasma half-life after single oral dose; AUC, area under the concentration vs. time curve"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Box 5.3 Pharmacokinetic Studies Conducted During theDevelopment of Psychotropic Drugs.BasicADMEcharacteristics (absorption,Cmax, plasma half-life,area under the curve, terminal half-life, volume of distribution,protein binding, clearance).Dose proportionalitycharacterizes the relationship between thedose administered and the plasma concentration of a drug. Theideal dose–concentration curve is linear, i.e. the plasmaconcentration of the drug correlates linearly with an orallyadministered dose of the drug. Over-proportionality means apositive alteration from linear dose–concentration kinetics, i.e. apronounced concentration increase with increasing drug dose(e.g. in the case of fluoxetine), whereas under-proportionalitymeans a negative alteration from linear kinetics (e.g. in the caseof carbamazepine). An over-proportional pharmacokineticprofile of a drug usually implies a more pronounced efficacyand adverse event profile at higher dose ranges, whereas in casesof under-proportionality the opposite should be expected.Food effect: absorption of most psychotropic drugs is notsignificantly affected by concomitant intake of food. Anexception is buspirone, with a twofold increase of absorptionwith food intake.Absolute bioavailability: this implies a comparison of plasmalevels after oral and i.v. administration of the drug. Mostpsychotropic drugs have a good bioavailability, i.e. valuesbetween 30 and 100%. Low bioavailability, as seen withbuspirone, is associated with highly variable drug plasmaconcentrations and is not a desirable feature of a drug.Therelative bioavailabilityof different formulations needs to bestudied if different galenical forms, e.g. capsules, tablets andliquid formulations, are used during the development of acompound.Inter- and intrasubject variabilityof pharmacokinetic parameters:there are many sources of variability (age, gender, pharmaco-genetic factors, hepatic impairment, renal impairment, smokingvs. non-smoking, pregnancy, concomitant use of other drugs)that need to be investigated during drug development. Inaddition to the generally required program, the specificpharmacokinetic studies depend on the intended clinical use ofa new medicationCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY159"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Phase I (presystemic or first-pass) metabolism can occur during drugabsorption either in the gut wall or in the liver, i.e. before a drug reaches thesystemic circulation. Typical phase I pathways are oxidation, reduction andhydrolysis of molecules; these reactions are responsible for the transformationof compounds into more polar, i.e. more water- and less lipid-soluble,molecules that can be eliminated by the kidneys and the biliary system. First-pass metabolism determines the fraction of an oral drug dose that will reachthe systemic circulation (i.e. the fraction of the drug that is bioavailable andhas a chance to get into the CNS). Drug that reaches the systemic circulation isredistributed to the liver via hepatic arterial blood. The unspecified term‘clearance’ refers to the rate at which a drug is cleared from the systemiccirculation. Thus, presystemic and systemic clearance together determine theconcentration achieved after a given dose of a given drug in a given patient.The importance of the P450 enzymes extends beyond determining theconcentration of a parent drug. These enzymes also determine the concentra-tion of drug metabolites that may or may not be pharmacologically active.Active metabolites of a drug can have pharmacological profiles different fromthose of the parent compound. For example, carbamazepine is a well-knownanticonvulsant drug with antimanic properties; however its epoxy-metabolite,although inactive in terms of CNS effects, is responsible for the significantenzyme-inductive effect of carbamazepine. Nefazodone is an antidepressantwith anxiolytic properties, whereas its active metabolite, meta-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP), is anxiogenic. The concentration of mCPP is generally onlya fraction of that of the parent drug: however, mCPP is dependent on theenzyme CYP2D6 for its biotransformation prior to elimination. Thus,concentrations of the anxiogenic metabolite can be appreciably higher thanusual (and thus induce anxiety) in individuals who are deficient in CYP2D6.More generally, the activity of P-450 enzymes can be an important determinantof atypical responses to medication if the usual ratio of parent drug to activemetabolite is altered.Both CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 are P-450 enzymes known to be geneticallypolymorphic, meaning that there are, within a population, several groups ofindividuals with different abilities to metabolize a given type of drug. Forexample, Caucasian populations comprise a large percentage of individualswho are genetically deficient in CYP2D6 – some 5–10% of the population areso-called ‘slow metabolizers’. Conversely, about 20% of Orientals aregenetically deficient in CYP2C19, leading to different metabolizing capacitiesfor certain drugs.The activity of CYP enzymes is also influenced by external factors such asfood and other drugs taken concomitantly:.Grapefruit juice contains a substance called naringine that inhibitsCYP3A4; thus, if grapefruit juice in large quantities is taken together with160PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"drugs that are metabolized by this CYP450 subtype, a higher than normaldrug exposure will result (Greenblattet al., 2001; Ho and Saville, 2001) andside effects may occur that are normally seen at higher doses of therespective medication..Drugs such as barbiturates and carbamazepine induce certain enzymes andwill then trigger faster breakdown of some concomitantly used antipsycho-tics and antidepressants. In contrast, paroxetine, fluoxetine and fluvox-amine, acting by different mechanisms, inhibit the breakdown of otherconcomitantly administered drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants,antiepileptics and neuroleptics (Table 5.1).Phase I reactions are followed byPhase II metabolic pathways: chemicalreactions such as conjugation, glucuronidation, methylation and acetylationare responsible for the formation of more water-soluble products by bindingthe compound with endogenous glucuronide, sulfate or glycine. Pharmaco-kinetic interactions with other drugs may also occur at this level.

Tricyclic antidepressants and all benzodiazepines are potentinhibitors of glucuronidation of morphine; as a consequence, they increase theplasma concentration of morphine, resulting in an additive effect beyond thepharmacodynamic interaction (Pacificiet al., 1986; Wahlstromet al., 1994).In summary, both Phase I and Phase II metabolic drug interactions are ofclinical relevance because they alter the steady-state concentrations of drugsand thereby attenuate or enhance their pharmacological effects; in extremecases this can either lead to a lack of therapeutic efficacy of a drug or to drugintoxication. The purpose of drug plasma level measurements here is to adjustthe dose to suit the new situation.Pharmacodynamic and PK^PD studiesThe objectives of pharmacodynamic studies early in development are todelineate and confirm the range of pharmacologically active doses in humans,together with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to describe the time-course of pharmacodynamic activity of a new compound. A variety ofmethodological approaches are used in pharmcodynamic studies, ranging fromsimple questioning of subjects and behavioral observations to the more recentbrain imaging and functional procedures (more detail in Chapter 3). Forputative CNS-active drugs, studies usually focus on:.Effects on psychomotor performance and cognitive function (in young andolder subjects, males and females) after single and multiple doses (Patat,2000)..Effects on electrophysiological parameters (pharmaco-electroencephalo-gram, evoked potentials); polygraphic sleep studies..Driving tests; interactions with alcohol..Effect on brain metabolic and perfusion parameters measured by functionalbrain imaging (SPECT, PET, fMRI: see Chapter 6)..Habituation and tolerance phenomena; withdrawal effects, reboundphenomena..Neuroendocrine changes.Dose-escalation studies performed in an early phase of drug developmentprovide preliminary information to explore pharmacodynamic parameters atdifferent dose levels up to the MTD. If the focus of a study is on the relation-ship between the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters (ratherthan on dose–response relationships), then the term PK–PD studies is used.5.3.3 ENDPOINTS AND MARKERS IN CLINICAL TRIALSAbiological markeris a physical sign or laboratory measurement that occurs inassociation with the pathology of a given disease and has a potential diagnostic162PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"or prognostic utility. Biological markers can reflect efficacy as well as safetyaspects of a drug, e.g.:.Atrophy of thesubstantia innominataon magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), reflecting degeneration of cholinergic neurons in thenucleus basalisof Meynert, may be anin vivomarker of cholinergic deficiency typical ofAlzheimer’s disease. The thickness of the substantia innominata shows asignificant positive correlation with the Mini Mental State Examination(MMSE) and thus may be useful as a predictive biological marker for theefficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors (Hanyuet al., 2002)..A prolongation of the QT interval seen in the electrocardiogram (ECG)serves as asafety biological markerfor heart function. Several psychotropicdrugs (chlorpromazine, imipramine, maprotiline, pimozide, thioridazine,sertindole, ziprasidone) prolong the QT interval and this has beenassociated with the occurrence of arrhythmias, in several cases withpotentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia, known as torsade de pointes;QTc is the QT interval corrected by the square root of the heart rateinterval; and prolongation of QTc represents a major safety concern fordrug regulatory authorities because it was responsible for about half of thesafety-related withdrawals of new drug applications at the FDA since 1998.Asurrogate endpointof a clinical trial is a biological marker used tosubstitute for a clinically meaningful endpoint that directly measures feelings,functions or events that are difficult to assess, or survival. Changes induced bypharmacological intervention on a surrogate endpoint are expected to reflectchanges in a clinically meaningful endpoint (Fleming and DeMets 1996;Temple, 1999). A surrogate endpoint for ‘survival’ needs to be supported byepidemiological evidence that the marker is indeed a risk factor, i.e.:.The marker must be consistent with pathophysiology..The marker must be correlated with a true clinical outcome and fullycapture the net effect of treatment on the clinical outcome..It must be on the pathway of the pharmacological intervention..It must not be confounded with adverse drug reactions.Strictly speaking, no generally accepted, valid surrogate efficacy marker hasbeen established in psychopharmacology so far. Several authors declarebiological markers as surrogate endpoints, e.g. some specific patterns ofreceptor occupancy seen in positron emission tomography (PET) trials (seeChapter 6). As an example, D2 receptor occupancy trials may predict theoutcome of treatments with antipsychotics because they indicate the pathwayof the pharmacological intervention, show correlation with extrapyramidalside effects but are not fully consistent with the pathophysiology ofschizophrenia. Early reports of elevated postsynaptic D2 dopamine receptorsin schizophrenic brain post mortem have not been consistently confirmed byCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY163"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"brain imaging studies of young neuroleptic naı ̈ve patients with schizophrenia(Farde, 1997). Furthermore, the psychotogenic effect of ketamine is notmediated by any significant changes in the dopamine release in the dorsalcaudate, dorsal putamen or ventral striatum as measured by11C-raclopride in aPET study of healthy volunteers (Kegeleset al., 2002).On the other hand, there are some biological markers in the cerebrospinalfluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer’s disease showing a correlation with theseverity of the disease, the extent of neurodegeneration, oxidative stress orneuroinflammation (see Chapter 7).The clinical endpointis a clinically meaningful measure of how patients feel,function or survive. Investigator-rated or self-assessed rating instruments are themost frequently used clinical endpoints. Aprimary endpointis the main outcomethat a study protocol is designed to evaluate. The statistical power and the samplesize calculation of a particular trial are determined by the primary endpoint.Depending on the purpose of a study the primary endpoint can be.An efficacy outcome measure (e.g. change from baseline in a symptomassessment instrument, response rate according to a predefined responsecriterion, remission rate, time to response, time to relapse according topredefined relapse criteria, etc.). For Phase III trials the primary endpointshould be a clinical event (such as full recovery) or clinical improvementrelevant to the patient (e.g. disappearance of specific symptoms)..A safety parameter: examples are drop-out rate due to adverse effects,adverse effects measured by a (side-effect-specific) rating instrument,biological markers, etc..Bioequivalence (e.g. equivalence of efficacy) of two different galenicalformulations of the same compound as measured by maintained remissionrates in schizophrenic patients after an oral or depot antipsychoticformulation..Other relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters.Anintermediate endpointis a clinical endpoint assessed at some stage of astudy but not at its very end.Ultimate outcomeis a clinical endpoint such assurvival, onset of serious morbidity or symptomatic response that captures thebenefits and risks of a treatment. Admission to a nursing home could serve asan ultimate outcome in the case of a drug intended to treat outpatients withAlzheimer’s disease.5.4 STUDY DESIGNS5.4.1 THE NEED FOR CONTROLLED STUDIESStudies in psychopharmacology have some specific features differentiatingthem from other disciplines of clinical research:164PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":".There is a significant degree of experimental variability across studies..Diagnostic categories are phenomenological constructs rather than biolo-gically homogenous entities (no specific biomarkers are established forpsychiatric disorders to differentiate mental illness from ‘normality’).Criteria for diagnosis are based on behavioral disturbances observed bythe diagnostician or reported by the patient (possibly people in hisenvironment)..Effect size of most treatments with psychotropic drugs tends to bemodest.For these reasons, hypothesis-testing studies in psychopharmacology must bewell controlled, i.e. employ one or more control groups (Leber, 1991). Becauseof the duration of treatment required to demonstrate a therapeutic effect(weeks or months in the case of antipsychotics, antidepressants, antipanic, etc.compounds), as well as the highly variable course of psychiatric disorders,double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with parallel-group design arerecommended in most situations. A clinical trial design that involves morethan one control treatment, typically a standard drug used in the sameindication and a placebo, represents one of the most informative designs, forseveral reasons:.A trial that demonstrates superiority of the new drug over placebo, plussuperiority of the standard drug over placebo, has demonstrated its assaysensitivity and may be considered a valid experiment..A trial of this kind provides a useful efficacy and safety standard to quantifythe treatment effects of a new drug against both an established drug andplacebo..Because two active drugs (causing effects and side effects) are involved, thedouble-blind character of the study is better protected throughout the trial..The study design increases the chances that a patient will receive an activetreatment rather than placebo.5.4.2 PARALLEL-GROUP DESIGNSThis design is generally preferred for large clinical trials. Parallel groups, i.e.statistically equivalent and concomitantly treated groups, are achieved byassigning patients randomly to one of two or more groups (‘treatment arms’).A clear advantage of the parallel-group design is its simplicity; its majordownside is the large variance due to individual differences between patientsincluded in the parallel groups. To decrease the variance it is recommendedthat patients are randomized according to one of the treatment groups bytreatment blocks.There is no completely satisfactory alternative to a parallel placebo controlgroup when seeking to establish the efficacy of psychopharmacological agents.CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY165"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"However, if the use of a placebo is impractical, or inappropriate for ethical ortechnical reasons, a multiple fixed-dose study without a placebo arm may be anacceptable option. This approach involves comparison of responses to a rangeof doses of the test drug in comparison with a standard compound. Whensignificant differences between treatment groups are observed, some positiveconclusions regarding efficacy can be derived from the data. However, amultiple fixed-dose study design also has some disadvantages:.There is a risk of false negative judgment if the wrong doses are selectedbecause of uncertainty about the therapeutic dose range of a drug..If significant differences between doses are not detected, no inference can bedrawn about drug efficacy..Purposely selecting a low dose outside the therapeutic range, or even a dosethat is thought to be marginally effective, raises the same ethical concerns asuse of a placebo.5.4.3 PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY DESIGNSThe parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design representsthe golden standard of acute treatment trials of depression, mania and anxietydisorders. This design is intended to limit bias, in particular selection andmeasurement bias. Trials based on this design are expected to provideinformation about the effect size of a new compound and its side-effect profile.There appears to be an emerging trend for rising placebo response ratesduring the past two decades in almost all pharmacotherapy trials of psychiatricdiseases. The reported placebo response rates were around 10% in placebo-controlled trials of lithium treatment of bipolar mania (Popeet al., 1991);however, the proportion of placebo responders exceeded 40% in a trial ofolanzapine by the end of the 1990s (Tohenet al., 2000). In early efficacy trialsof obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) the placebo response rates used to bearound 5%, whereas the rates reported in studies published in the 1990s haverisen to more than 25%. A meta-analysis of clinical trial data from 9antidepressants and 13 anxiolytics approved by the FDA between 1985 and2000 pointed at the consequences of placebo response rates in depression trials(Khanet al., 2002). These studies comprised a total of 18 370 patients sufferingfrom depression or anxiety disorders who participated in 93 treatment arms ofa new or established antidepressant in 52 different antidepressant studies, or in75 treatment arms of 40 different anxiolytic trials. Less than half of theantidepressant or anxiolytic treatment arms showed superiority over placebo(48% in both indications: 45 of 93 for the antidepressant; 36 of 75 for theanxiolytics). Elimination of placebo controls in favour of non-inferioritydesigns (Section 5.4.4) would have resulted in a high likelihood that ineffective166PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"antidepressants or anxiolytics had been approved, and potentially effectivecompounds would have been missed (Khanet al., 2002).Another meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials in depression publishedbetween 1980 and 2000 showed an increase in the response rates in the placeboarms of trials with a variety of antidepressants (Walshet al., 2002). Responsesto placebo increased significantly in recent years, as shown by the high positivecorrelation with the year of publication. The association between response rateand year of publication was more statistically robust for placebo than foractive medication. The change in placebo response rate did not appear to beexplained directly by changes in study characteristics such as patient age,placebo lead-in or minimum required Hamilton Rating Scale for Depressionscore. A potential explanation could be the changing awareness of patients andthe fact that many patients in recent clinical trials had been exposed to severalprevious treatments and thus expected to improve (see Box 5.4).A large response in the placebo group of an antidepressant trial clearlyreduces the power of the study. One-third of all published trials ofantidepressants fail to demonstrate efficacy, therefore new strategies arerequired for the reduction of variance. Meta-analysis of baseline characteristicsof more than 2000 depressed patients included in the development program ofan antidepressant showed remarkable differences between study participants inthe USA and Europe (Niklson and Reimitz, 2001): European patients hadsignificantly higher average baseline scores on several depression scales,particularly on items indicative of anxiety/agitation, somatization and sleepdisturbance. Overall their depression appeared more severe, with moremelancholic features than seen in the US patients. Such differences areprobably relevant because observations made in other studies indicate thatinclusion of patients with mild depression increases the risk of non-discrimination between drug and placebo. Thus, a meta-analysis of studieswith four antidepressant medications showed that 41% of patients with scoresof 18–20 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) responded toplacebo, whereas patients with scores of 21–24 and 25–29 had considerablylower (23 and 22%, respectively) placebo response rates (Wilcoxet al., 1992).Similarly in a number of studies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs), less severely depressed patients, i.e. those with HRSD baseline scoresof less than 28, had higher placebo response rates than patients with higherscores (Schatzberg and Kraemer, 2000). On the other hand, a severity of illnessabove ‘moderately severe’ is not a major factor predictive of significant active-versus-placebo treatment differences (Montgomery, 1999).Another important factor that may favor placebo responses in clinicalstudies is probably thepatient recruitmentstrategy, as suggested by thefollowing observation: two almost identically designed studies with fluoxetinevs. placebo in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) wereperformed, but only one of them resulted in a significant difference betweenCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY167"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"active drug and placebo (Marte ́nyi, 2002). Inclusion criteria according to theprotocol were the same in both studies, but a possible explanation for thedifferential outcomes could be the different sources of patients in Europe and inthe USA.

Some apparent placebo effectsmay be due to spontaneous remissions whereas others areclearly not. Spontaneous remissions are only partly predictablefor a given time interval. Patients on waiting lists show clearlythe natural course of the disease, spontaneous remission andworsening (see Fig. 5.3).(2)Conditioning. A Pavlovian explanation of placebo effects hasbeen based on the traditional model of classical conditioning:active ingredients serve as unconditional stimuli and thevehicles in which they are delivered (pills, injections), particu-larly the elements of therapeutic procedures, function asconditional stimuli. After repeated pairing of unconditionedand conditioned stimuli, the conditional stimulus elicits aconditional response even if the conditioned stimulus (e.g. thepill) is presented alone (without active ingredient).(3)Expectancy. The aim of placebo control is to challenge andavoid the perception of clinical changes (improvement orworsening) caused by expectations on the part of both patientsand physicians. The expectancy effect is ‘‘the tendency forexperimenters to obtain results they expect, not simply becausethey have correctly anticipated nature’s response but ratherbecause they have helped to shape that response through theirexpectation’’ (Rosenthal and Rubin, 1978). Expectancy isdifferent from distortion: ‘‘The distortion effect comes fromseeing what you want to see, even if it’s not there. Theexpectancy effect involves creating the objective results that wewant to see. We don’t distort results to conform to ourexpectations as much as we make the expectations come true.Strictly speaking: the expectancy effect is not a response effectat all’’ (Bernard, 1995)."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"antidepressants and anxiolytics is increased if placebo responses are reduced byrecruitment of moderately to severely depressed or anxious patients (Thase,1999; see Box 5.5).In contrast to experience with depression, placebo response rates of trials insocial phobia show a rather constant pattern during the past decade: between 9and 29% of patients were characterized as placebo responders as measured bythe Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (Kobaket al., 2002).Owing to the variable nature of most mental disorders, the preferred designfor studying acute treatment of depression, mania, generalized anxiety disorder(GAD), social phobia, panic disorder, PTSD, OCD, several psychoticdisorders, agitation in the elderly, etc. is the randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled parallel-group trial, using patient samples of adequate size.As noted earlier, there are differences between the USA and Europe withregard to registration requirements: the FDA requires two independent,adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials to support an acute indicationclaim (depression, schizophrenia, mania, panic disorder, OCD, PTSD, etc.).The EMEA-CPMP guidelines require comparison of a new compound withestablished active treatment, and in many cases with placebo as well, preferablyin three-arm designs.Specific Placebo-controlledTrial DesignsDepending on the purpose of a study there are several subtypes of placebo-controlled trials (see Fig. 5.3). One design makes use of a single-blindplacebolead-in period. The purposes of this pretrial period of up to 4 weeks are:.To allow time for washout of previously taken psychotropic medication..To allow time for medical assessments and evaluation of laboratory tests..To permit patients to change their minds regarding participation in the trial..To assess the patients during a prospectively monitored drug-free intervalfor substance use (drug screen, blood and/or urine level measurement)..To allow for repeated assessment of symptom severity and stability, i.e. toidentify and take out patients with clear placebo response or earlyspontaneous improvements.This design may help to screen out placebo responders as well as bipolardepressed patients with transient exacerbations of symptoms, or subjectssuffering from anxiety disorders in response to environmental psychologicalstressors. However, the value of this design is limited because it will not reducepotential investigator bias, i.e. the expectation of pharmacological effects aftera given time.An interesting approach to deal with this specific issue and to reduce furtherthe placebo response rates is the use of ablinded lead-in as well as a blindedlead-out period.

Allpatients will be treated with active compound or placebo for the same length oftime, and therefore the study will also end with a blinded placebo lead-outphase of variable duration. This design was used in a placebo-controlled trialwith duloxetine (a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor) in thetreatment of major depression. The study showed a significant differencebetween the active treatments and placebo as early as after 4 weeks, i.e. with adelay similar to that seen in conventional studies, and therefore the additionalvalue of the blinded lead-in and lead-out approach remains doubtful (Farieset al., 2002; Goldsteinet al., 2002).A design intended specifically to investigate the effect of discontinuation orwithdrawal symptoms of a particular compound, or comparing differentcompounds with regard to withdrawal symptoms, is theplacebo-controlleddiscontinuation or cessation design. Insertion of a placebo treatment phasewithin the course of active treatment for several days allows the observation ofdiscontinuation and withdrawal symptoms. The design requires frequentsampling during the entire length of study. A placebo-controlled trial wasdesigned to differentiate fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline from each otherbased on discontinuation symptoms. The 5–8 day placebo substitutioninterrupting the antidepressive treatment provoked detectable differencesbetween the drugs, favoring fluoxetine (Rosenbaumet al., 1998).Several trials have been performed with antidepressants in the prevention ofrecurrence of major depression. In an exemplary trial of this kind, Reimherret al.(1998) explored the optimal length of therapy in a long-term,placebo-controlled continuation studyof patients who had responded to 12–14 weeks ofopen-label fluoxetine treatment (20 mg/day) for major depression. Differentmaintenance schedules were represented by four treatment arms:.Group A: 50 weeks of treatment with placebo..Group B: 14 weeks on fluoxetine, followed by 36 weeks on placebo..Group C: 38 weeks on fluoxetine, then 12 weeks on placebo..Group D: 50 weeks on fluoxetine.Relapse rates were significantly reduced among the patients on continuedfluoxetine treatment (group D) compared with those who were switched toplacebo after the open 12–14 week period of active drug treatment (group A).Group B also showed significantly higher relapse rates than group D, whereasthe difference in relapse rates between groups C and D was smaller and notstatistically significant. The authors concluded that patients ‘‘treated withfluoxetine for 12 weeks whose depressive symptoms remit should continuetreatment with fluoxetine for at least an additional 26 weeks to minimize therisk of relapse’’ (Reimherret al., 1998).172PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Placebo-controlled long-term trials can also produce additional clinicallyrelevant information. Thus, in a trial of 18 months of treatment with recentlyhypomanic or manic bipolar patients, both lamotrigine and lithium weresuperior to placebo at prolonging the time to further mood episodes, i.e. bothdrugs prevented relapse or recurrence. However, the study also showed thatlamotrigine was superior to placebo regarding the prolongation of the time tothe next depressive episode, whereas lithium was superior to placebo inprolonging the time to the next manic episode (Calabreseet al., 2002).Generally speaking, success of placebo-controlledrelapse prevention trialsdepends on:.The duration of a trial: the longer the study, the higher the chances ofdifferentiation between active drug and placebo..The homogeneity of the patient population studied..The probability of relapse: the previous pattern of relapses is the bestpredictor for further relapses.A much discussed approach to the study of disease-modifying treatmenteffects, e.g. in degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, is therandomized placebo-phase lead-indesign. This design is intended to address thequestion of whether subjects who begin active treatment earlier in the course oftheir disease have a stronger (or more sustained) response to a pharmacologicalintervention than those who start treatment later. Patients enter the activetreatment phase after being assigned randomly to a period of time (fromseveral months up to a year) on placebo treatment. Groups of patients are thenswitched blindly from placebo to active drug (Feldmanet al., 2001). A strongerand better sustained therapeutic response seen in patients switched to activemedication earlier in time would suggest an effect on the progression of thedisorder, i.e. a potential disease-modifying drug action. However, therandomized placebo phase needed for this design raises some ethical questions:it is certainly not acceptable to delay treatment in cases of potentially life-threatening diseases, although this design may be able to provide relevantinformation about the optimal onset of treatment in a chronic, progressivedisease.5.4.4 ALTERNATIVES TO PLACEBO-CONTROLLED DESIGNSGiven the ethical concerns about placebo-controlled study designs, severalalternative procedures to reduce bias in clinical trials have been proposed:.Use of historical (placebo) data..Comparison of current treatment with waiting list..Comparison of the new with an established standard treatment.CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY173"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Use of Historical (Placebo) DataThis option assumes a comparable or even standard placebo response rate forhistorical data and the current trial. The historical improvement rate (onplacebo or without any treatment) is then used for purposes of comparisonwith results of subsequent non-placebo-controlled studies involving the sameinvestigator and protocol design but different drugs. For historical placeboresponse data it is recommended that a small placebo treatment arm is used forsafety data purposes and to avoid observer bias – although this proposal mayresolve or diminish some ethical concerns, it raises a number of scientificproblems:.The approach neglects the fact that placebo or no-drug treatment responsesare dependent on a number of factors that are likely to change over time..Expectations on the part of doctors and patients regarding treatment effectschange over time..The clinical and/or comorbidity profile of the same disease can changewithin a limited period, increasing or decreasing the chances of a newtreatment.In summary, and as supported by the shifting placebo response rates quotedearlier, use of historical placebo or no-treatment data does not appear to be areliable alternative to the use of concurrent placebo.Comparison of CurrentTreatment withWaiting ListInstead of using a placebo treatment arm, this approach compares a treatedpatient population with subjects receiving no treatment at all (see Fig. 5.4).Assuming that the status of patients remains unchanged or does not deteriorateduring the waiting period, this approach may be permissible in cases of lesssevere diseases. However, there are several significant downsides of so-calledwaiting list comparisons:.From a therapeutic aspect the ‘no treatment’ condition provides much lessattention to patients’ problems than participation in a placebo treatment arm..Spontaneous fluctuations of symptoms are not usually assessed during thewaiting list period..Living longer with the prevailing symptoms may have a negative ‘disease-modifying effect’ and demoralize a patient, hence contributing to a self-down-rating bias.5.4.5 COMPARISONS WITH ACTIVE COMPARATOR DRUGSDirect comparison of a new compound with an active drug used in the sameindication can provide the following information:174PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":".Equivalence of the new drug with standard (established) treatment..Superiority of the new drug over standard (established) comparatortreatment..Non-inferiority of the new drug compared with established treatment.Equivalence trials aim to show that the effects of two treatments differ by nomore than a specific amount. To show the equivalence, two one-sided statisticaltests are performed to ascertain that the new treatment is not inferior to theestablished active treatment and that the established treatment is not inferior tothe new drug. The allowed tolerance is known as the equivalence margin (d). Inan equivalence trial, if the effects of the two treatments differ by more than theequivalence margin in either direction, the assumption of equivalence does nothold. When comparing a new psychotropic treatment with an activecomparator, the hypothesis usually being tested is the assumption ofnon-inferiorityof the new drug (predefined as an a priory equivalence margin) inone-sided statistical tests: the aim is to show that the experimental treatment isnot inferior to the active control by more than the equivalence margin.Demonstration of equivalence is not requested by health authorities, except insome specific indications outside of psychiatry.A finding of no significant difference in outcome between two treatments isambiguous unless a non-inferiority design is used. Two-arm non-inferioritydesigns require much larger sample sizes to test adequately the statisticalhypothesis of no true difference in efficacy between a test and reference drug.CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY175Figure 5.4Theoretical comparison of results of a placebo-controlled trial compared withthe ‘waiting list’or no-treatment approach: A, placebo effect; B, effect size of treatment;A+B, clinical effect"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Small differences in efficacy are very hard to detect using a two-arm studydesign because of the inherently large variance of psychopharmacologicalstudies.The results of a non-inferiority design trial can lead to one of the followingconclusions:.The new drug is non-inferior to the standard treatment (see Box 5.6)..The new drug failed to show the non-inferiority criterion to the standardtreatment..The new drug is superior to the standard treatment.An adequately powered trial initially designed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a new compound compared with a standard treatment can alsodemonstrate the superiority of the new compound provided that a statisticallysignificant difference in favor of the new treatment was detected. However,trials intended to show the superiority of one of the treatments cannot beinterpreted, in the case of a statistically non-significant difference, as showingnon-inferiority of the new chemical entity compared with the standardtreatment.Box 5.6 Amisulpride vs. Paroxetine: a Non-inferiority TrialA non-inferiority trial was designed to show that amisulpride isnot clinically less efficacious than a widely used antidepressant.Paroxetine was chosen as the reference compound because ofits recognized efficacy in major depression. A 15% differencein response rates was predefined as clinically acceptable andmethodologically justifiable because it is smaller than theaverage difference in response rates between paroxetine andplacebo reported in the literature. A total of 277 so-calleddouble-depressed patients (major depression with comorbidity ofdysphoria) were randomized to paroxetine (20 mg/day) or toamisulpride (50 mg/day). A high response rate was achieved inboth groups: there were 76% responders in the amisulpridegroup and 84% in the paroxetine group by week 8, the differencebeing 8% and the 95% upper limit being 15.7%. Because the upperlimit of the confidence interval included the predefined non-inferiority margin, the null hypothesis of a clinically relevantdifference was rejected and amisulpride was considered to be non-inferior to paroxetine in the treatment of double depression(Cassanoet al., 2002).176PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Selecting the Dose of an Active ComparatorActive comparators are used in placebo-controlled trials primarily to validatethe study results. In addition, the effect size seen with an active comparatorprovides guidance concerning the effect size of the new treatment incomparison with an established treatment. In studies without a placebo armand not demonstrating a significant difference, it is often not possible todetermine whether the lack of difference was due to equal effectiveness of thetreatments or the result of a type II error, i.e., the erroneous assumption thatthere was no difference between treatments (although in fact there was adifference).A crucial issue in comparative trials is to choose the appropriate dose rangeof the comparator drug. Inappropriate doses of the standard drug, e.g. dosesoutside the recommended range, will lead to inconclusive results or to biasedcompetitive advantages (Safer, 2002). A trial with hypericum perforatumcompared with placebo and sertraline in the treatment of major depressivedisorder provides an example: this outpatient study in moderately-severedepressed patients failed to show significant differences between hypericum andplacebo treatment on the HRSD but also failed to demonstrate significantdifferences between sertraline and placebo. Response rates were 38.1%, 50%and 48.6% for hypericum, placebo and sertraline, respectively. The dosageschedule allowed a maximum daily dose of 1800 mg of hypericum, whereas thedose of sertraline was restricted to 100 mg/day (although the recommendeddose range is 50–200 mg/day). Given the unwarranted dose limitation forsertraline and the non-significant differences between the three treatments, thestudy results are inconclusive and much time, effort and money was essentiallywasted (Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group, 2002).Safety and partly efficacy outcomes of several comparative antipsychoticdrug trials were biased by the implementation of unnecessarily high doses ofhaloperidol (20 mg/day or more). Meta-analysis of data from more than 12 000patients included in 52 randomized trials comparing atypical antipsychotics(amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and sertindole)with conventional compounds (usually haloperidol or chlorpromazine) led tothe conclusion that doses of haloperidol of greater than 12 mg/day producedfewer favorable symptom changes than doses of less than 12 mg/day (Geddeset al., 2000). If the doses of haloperidol were restricted to a maximum of 12 mg/day, atypical antipsychotics had no more clear-cut advantages in terms ofefficacy or overall tolerability but still caused fewer extrapyramidal side effects.Doses of haloperidol above 10 mg/day produce no better clinical response thanthe dose range of 4–10 mg/day (Baldessariniet al., 1988; Rifkinet al., 1991).Some published examples illustrating the use of (biasing) high doses ofstandard drug are trials with risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia,with haloperidol used as a comparator (Chouinardet al., 1993; Marder andCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY177"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Meibach, 1994). In these comparisons the high doses of haloperidol ensuredthat the investigational new atypical antipsychotic had a better extrapyramidalside-effect profile than the conventional antipsychotic.5.4.6 WITHIN-PATIENT DESIGNSSingle-case DesignThe purpose of within-patient designs is to reduce variability between patientsby using the study subjects as their own controls. This design can be used onlyin diseases having a chronic course, or in cases of recurrence of disease episodeswithin a reasonable period of time. Intensive and systematic tracking of a smallnumber of patients who are put, for example, on active drug and placebo atvariable and randomized intervals can provide valuable information about theefficacy and safety profile of a new drug. An example is the treatment ofchronic primary or secondary sleep disturbance, where the episodic improve-ment due to a hypnotic drug will not solve the sleep disorder for a longerperiod. Results of single-case studies can be useful for early hypothesis testing;however, the strong impact of each individual’s response and of the veryspecific experimental conditions on the results need to be considered.Crossover DesignsA randomized crossover design has theoretical appeal because it eliminates thelargest source of experimental variance: interindividual variability. This couldsignificantly enhance statistical power and permit much smaller samples sizesto detect a treatment effect. Unfortunately, a crossover design is appropriateonly in rare cases in psychopharmacology, namely in studies:.dealing with chronic stable conditions.where within-subject variability is expected to be less than between-subjectvariability.if patients return to the baseline condition after each therapeuticinterventionHowever, if the response to the first treatment is likely to affect the second one(‘carryover effect’), the results of a trial may be jeopardized. Carryover effectsfrom earlier to subsequent treatment can be corrected partially by randomassignment of patients to the sequence of treatments used. Nevertheless, in thecase of a significant degree of carryover effect (as is the case in therapeutic trialsleading to definite symptom resolution or remission), a parallel-group design isclearly preferable for a reliable estimation of treatment effects (Willam andPater, 1986). Pharmacological carryover effects between two active compoundscan be reduced by inserting a placebo period after the first treatment. The178PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"duration of the placebo period then has to be justified based on thepharmacokinetic properties of the compounds involved (Senn, 1994).Latin Square DesignThis is an extension of the crossover design that applies in situations wheremore than two treatment conditions are being evaluated. Each subject receiveseach treatment successively but in a different sequence. This design can be usedin the case of single-dose experimental trials, such as studies of cognitivefunction, psychomotor performance, psychophysiological responses, etc. inhealthy volunteers (Chapter 3) but also in therapeutic short-term trials ofhypnotics or anxiolytics.5.4.7 METHODOLOGY TO MINIMIZE BIAS IN OPEN-LABELTRIALSIn some situations double-blind placebo-controlled trials are not acceptablefrom an ethical standpoint; examples are studies on patients in life-threateningconditions such as severe withdrawal symptoms (e.g. delirium tremens) ordiseases with a high risk of suicide. To keep double-blind conditions in long-term treatment may also be difficult or even impossible, e.g. if one of the drugsused needs special safety monitoring or if the side-effect profile requires specialtreatment considerations.In this situation the use of trial-independent, blinded raters assessing theprimary endpoints of a study can ensure unbiased ratings, although it will noteliminate other confounding factors operating during a trial.Independent blinded raters are health professionals from a differentdepartment or from outside, with no information about details of thetreatment studied. Their involvement in the trial is limited to providing ratingsfor the primary study endpoint(s).CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY179Group IDrug ADrug BPlaceboGroup IIDrug BPlaceboDrug AGroup IIIPlaceboDrug ADrug BFigure 5.5Illustration of a 3\u00013 Latin Square design: trial of two different drugs andplacebo"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Independent endpoint committees are groups of experts who, based onblinded and standardized reports, decide whether specific event(s) reportedfor a patient meet the criteria of a defined primary endpoint. Examples ofendpoints are imminent need of hospitalization, suicide attempt, etc. (seeBox 5.7).5.4.8 LONGITUDINAL STUDY DESIGNSIn principle three different types of questions require long-term studies:(1) Does a given treatment provide benefit in terms ofprevention of relapse?This question can be approached with a design of open-label acute(symptomatic) treatment followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlledperiod, randomizing responders to acute treatment into a maintenancetreatment or into a placebo arm. An ‘enrichment design’ (enriching thesample for responders) of this kind has inherent limitations regarding thegeneralizability of results, because only responders in the open treatmentphase are included in the long-term continuation, and attrition during theopen-label treatment phase may reach 50% or more. An alternative to theenrichment design is to randomize patients to active drug or placebomaintenance treatment arms in an inter-episode period, i.e. at a time whenthey are remitted from the disorder.(2) What is theminimum duration of maintenance treatmentproviding clinicalbenefit, e.g. to prevent relapse or recurrence of a depressive episode (seep. 277 f.; Reimherret al., 1998)? The design addressing this issue is similarto the previous one but with different durations of active-maintenancetreatment arms compared with a full-time placebo treatment arm.(3) In cases of chronic disease, does early treatment initiation provide benefitfor the long-term outcome of the disease, i.e. does the treatment have adisease-modifying effect? Questions of this type are often asked with regardto the drug treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Rappa-portet al., 1998) or early drug treatment of high-risk children from parentswith affective disorders (Duffy, 2000) and schizophrenia (Cornblatt, 2002;McGorryet al., 2002). Evidence from both retrospective and prospectivestudies suggests that a longer duration of untreated psychosis in the earlystages of schizophrenia is associated with a prolonged time to remission,with lower levels of recovery, a greater likelihood of relapse and pooreroverall outcome. Early intervention and optimal maintenance treatmentare thought to improve the long-term course of schizophrenia (Sheitmanand Lieberman, 1998).The ethical and methodological issues of long-term placebo-controlled designsare basically the same as in shorter trials. However, long-term studies pose180PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY181Box 5.7 An Open-label Comparative Trial with BlindedAssessmentsA recent example of how rater bias can be reduced in an open-labelcomparative trial is given in a comparative study between clozapineand olanzapine with regard to their effect on suicidality in patientswith schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder with a high risk ofsuicide (Meltzeret al., 2003). Because one of the medications usedin this prospective, randomized parallel-group trial requires regularblood monitoring for safety reasons, the study was open-label. Itsduration was 2 years in order to provide time to obtain a sufficientnumber of endpoints to differentiate between the two treatments.Two approaches were used to minimize the bias of the open-labeltreatment conditions upon assessments: blinded ratings of clinicalstatus by specifically trained, study-independent assessors; anddetermination of whether certain actions and events met the criteriafor a suicide attempt or hospitalization to prevent suicide. Thesecond assessment was performed by an independent expert SuicideMonitoring Board (SMB) who had no contact with the participat-ing sites, i.e. neither with the patients nor the medical staffinvolved.Significant differences were observed with regard to all primaryoutcome measures:(1) A hazard ratio of 0.76 was established for suicide attempts orhospitalizations as determined by the SMB for the clozapine-treated patients, i.e. suicide events were reduced by 24%(P¼0.03) compared with olanzapine.(2) The cumulative probability of a suicide attempt or hospitaliza-tion to prevent a suicide was significantly different by Kaplan–Meier estimates (P<0.02) in favor of clozapine.(3) Actual suicide attempts were made by 6.9% of clozapine- and11.2% of olanzapine-treated patients (P<0.05), and 16.7% ofpatients on clozapine vs. 21.8% on olanzapine (P<0.05)required hospitalization to prevent suicide as determined by theSMB.In the total sample of 609 patients the mean (SD) prescribeddosages of study drugs were 16.8 (7.4) mg for olanzapine and 306(166) mg for clozapine."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"added complexities, some of which remain unresolved despite growingemphasis on continuation and maintenance treatment in several areas ofpsychopharmacology. Because long-term placebo administration is not feasiblein a number of conditions, several types of single-blind designs have beenproposed, none of them able to provide fully satisfactory answers. An oftenused procedure is periodically to discontinue and/or replace active drugtreatment with placebo. Another type of longitudinal study is the ‘mirroredimage’ trial, in which the course of illness during the study treatment iscompared with the course of illness during an equivalent period of priortreatment with another drug or no treatment at all. These designs can providesome useful information about a drug’s long-term efficacy but are not regardedas being conclusive due to the lack of a concurrent control group (Wyatt, 1991).Longitudinal, non-blinded observation studies are a practical way to accruemuch valuable safety data during chronic use of a new drug. In the case ofbipolar disorder, or more generally in the case of cyclic mental diseases, a life-charting methodology can provide relevant data concerning the influence onthe course of disease of the introduction of a new drug as monotherapy or in anadd-on manner (Leverich and Post, 1993).5.4.9 CASE^CONTROL STUDIESIn contrast to the previously discussed prospective trial designs, case–controlstudies are retrospective in nature. Clinically definedcases, e.g. patients treatedwith a specific drug for a given time, are compared with matchedcontrols, i.e.patients with the same diagnosis, age, gender, etc. but treated with anotherdrug or not treated at all. Control subjects are selected from existing databasescontaining information on patients from the same population observed at thesame time as the cases. Case–control studies can provide evidence abouttreatment effects as well as information on whether a particular interventionwas effective to prevent serious or fatal outcomes. Two published examplesillustrate the importance of case–control studies in psychopharmacology:.In the 1970s a strong association had been suggested betweenin uteroexposition to lithium treatment of pregnant women and a particular damage(Ebstein’s anomaly) to the heart in the offspring. The relative risk forEbstein’s anomaly among such children was estimated to be 400 (i.e. 400times higher!) on the basis of data collected in a registry of spontaneouslyreported cases. However, subsequent controlled (case–control) epidemio-logical studies consistently showed a lower risk. In four independent case–control studies of Ebstein’s anomaly involving more than 200 affectedchildren, no mothers who had taken lithium during pregnancy were found.Thus, although initial information regarding the teratogenic risk oflithium treatment was derived from spontaneous, uncontrolled reports,182PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"systematically collected data from case–control and cohort studies indicatedthat the teratogenic risk of first-trimester lithium exposure is definitely lowerthan previously suggested (Cohenet al., 1994)..The potential impact on suicidality of different pharmacotherapies wasanalyzed in a study of 61 suicide victims within a hospital sample of morethan 27 000 admissions during a 20-year period. Cases and case–controlswere matched for age, gender and diagnosis (schizophrenia or affectivedisorder) at the time of discharge. This comparative study detected somesignificant differences between the treatment of suicide victims comparedwith the non-suicidal patients: lorazepam withdrawal or dose reduction wasmore frequent and the use of mood-stabilizers was less frequent among theschizophrenic suicide victims. Lithium was given significantly more often tonon-suicidal patients than to patients who then committed suicide (Gaertneret al., 2002). These findings are consonant with results from meta-analysesof prospective, placebo-controlled lithium trials, which also showed an anti-suicidal effect of lithium (Baldessariniet al., 1999).5.5 PHASES OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT5.5.1 PHASE I CLINICALTRIALS:TOLERABILITY,PHARMACOKINETICS, HUMAN PHARMACOLOGYTolerability and PharmacokineticTrialsThe testing of a new psychotropic substance in man always begins withinvestigations into its tolerability. These are usually conducted in healthysubjects who are informed about the aims and possible risks of a study andwho then volunteer to participate in the trial for some financial compensation.Tolerability trials call for close medical supervision and readiness to deal withany emergencies, even though the first doses of the new substance to be testedin man, based as they are on the results of animal experiments, are so low thatthey generally have no effect at all. The dosage is increased gradually in orderto keep the risk for the volunteers as low as possible (see Fig. 5.6).A human single-dose exposition trial must be preceded by 2–4 week rodentand 2-week non-rodent toxicity studies. The animal toxicity requirements areincremental by exposition: for up to 1 month the Phase I and II trials require1-month rodent and 1-month non-rodent toxicity studies (see Table 5.2).Because this is the first time the new drug is being administered to humanbeings, only a small number of individuals will be exposed, i.e. some 4–6persons may be involved. First tolerability trials could, in principle, be runwithout placebo control until dosages are reached at which distinct effectsbecome apparent.

At this very early stage ofclinical development, tolerability problems will serve as a clear no-go decisioncriterion. It should be noted, however, that the tolerability profile ofpsychotropic drugs given as single doses to healthy volunteers is likely tovary from what is seen in psychiatric patients on repeated-dose administration;as a rule, antipsychotics and antimanic compounds are usually better toleratedby patients than by healthy subjects.Although it is not normally feasible to include comprehensive psychologicalor psychophysiological testing during the first tolerability trials, becausemedical aspects have to be paramount at this stage, it is possible to determinewith considerable reliability any pronounced central actions of a substance aswell as the approximate duration of such effects. Examples are effects onvigilance, attention, concentration and potential side effects such as sedation,stimulation, euphoric effects, etc. Further data also will be available as to theeffects of the preparation on vital functions such as ECG, respiration andcirculation, as well as on biochemical laboratory tests, liver enzyme and renalfunctions.Within the context of initial tolerability testing, blood samples should betaken from the subjects at predetermined intervals of time. Tests are thenconducted to determine if, when and in what concentrations the substance andits metabolites are detectable in the blood, when peak blood levels are reachedand the way in which they decrease (Section 5.3.2). These data make it possibleto establish more precisely the intervals that should elapse between dosesduring later studies involving repeated administration of the substance.Initial Dose and Dose Escalation in Early Human StudiesThe first dose administered to man is a fraction of the ‘no-effect’ dose or noadverse event level (NOAEL) determined in animal toxicology studies.Typically the first human dose is 1/25 to 1/100 of the NOAEL in mg/kg. So-called allometric scales are used by clinical pharmacologists to estimate humandoses from toxicology findings.Allometric scalingis expected to optimisepredictions from one species to another; it takes into account body weight,clearance, volume of distribution and elimination half-life (Mahmood andBalian, 1999). Several methods are then available to determine the incrementsduring dose escalation. Depending on the pharmacological profile andtoxicological findings in animal studies, three different schemes are recom-mended: doubling the dose at each step; increasing the dose in a logarithmicmanner; and using the Fibonacci scheme (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.). A pharmaco-logically guided dose escalation is based on PK–PD considerations: whencomparing the animal and human doses, equal toxicity is expected for equalCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY185"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"drug exposure. The doses are adjusted based on unbound (‘free’) plasmaconcentrations of the molecule.Early Multiple-dose StudiesThe aim of these trials is to establish the tolerability and pharmacokineticprofile of a new drug on a small number of healthy volunteers after multipledoses. The administration scheme of the drug is driven by the previous animaland single-dose human pharmacokinetic data. In the case of a plasma half-lifeof less than 10 h the administration should be twice daily (b.i.d.), for a shorterplasma half-life it should be three times daily (t.i.d.). This approach hasimportance only in drugs used potentially for chronic administration(depression, anxiety, psychosis, etc.); hypnotics with typical episodic use donot require this approach. Additional PK–PD information can be obtainedduring early multiple-dose trials by combining blood sampling withpharmacodynamic parameters such as pharmaco-EEG, evoked potentials,endocrine parameters, reaction time, cognitive tests, etc.The Bridging Approach: Phase I Trials in PatientsIn some instances, patients may respond differently to healthy young or oldervolunteers. Separate studies are then needed to determine the maximumtolerated dose (MTD) in the target patient population with ‘bridging studies’prior to designing Phase II efficacy trials. Well-controlled safety/tolerabilitytrials with a small number of patients on an inpatient basis are performed toestablish the population- and disease-specific MTD and to characterize themost frequent adverse events. Early studies in patients can be used also toinvestigate PK–PD relationships, to optimize the dosing regimen forsubsequent trials, to confirm that the drug is affecting the targeted receptorand to measure correlations between drug activity and potential surrogatemarkers.5.5.2 PROOF-OF-CONCEPT (PoC) TRIALS (PHASE IIa TRIALS)Aproof-of-concept(PoC)studyis a ‘‘human clinical trial that providesscientifically sound evidence supporting the postulated effect(s) of a newtherapeutic product in human, where effects may be relevant pharmacologicalor disease biomarkers, surrogate endpoints, or clinical assessments, and may bebeneficial and/or toxic in nature’’ (Leskoet al., 2000). The termsproof ofprincipleandproof of conceptare sometimes used interchangeably, althoughPoC occurs generally earlier in drug development than proof of principle. ThePoC trials are designed to provide evidence that a pharmacological model is186PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"reliable and predictive and that a pharmacological treatment paradigm may befeasible. The PoC trials comprise:.Proof-of-mechanism(PoM) trials: the objective is to demonstrate themechanism of action of a new compound using biological markers. Afrequent question in early drug development is whether the new compoundpenetrates the blood–brain barrier. Targeted radiotracer displacementstudies (with isotope-labeled receptor agonists or antagonists), changes inbrain glucose metabolism measured by single-photon-emission computedtomography (SPECT) methods (Chapter 6) or general non-specific changesdetected by functional MRI or pharmaco-EEG methods can provide earlyinformation about the blood–brain barrier penetration and basic mechan-isms of action of a molecule. The sample size of PoM studies is usuallylimited to 10–20 persons..Proof-of-efficacytrials: these studies should provide, within a limited timeframe and with a low-cost program, sufficient information for a go/no-godecision concerning efficacy and safety aspects of a new compound. Thetraditional approaches are Phase IIb trials based on placebo-controlleddose-finding designs. These studies need relatively high power, which meansthe inclusion of several dozen to several hundred patients.Challenge Paradigms in PoC TrialsThe aim of challenge paradigms is to evoke specific, transient mental alterationsor symptoms in healthy volunteers or patients under controlled experimentalconditions, allowing the effect of treatment on the symptoms provoked to beinvestigated. As an example, challenge paradigms to investigate the antipaniceffect of anxiolytics have good predictive validity. Thus, antipanic drugs(imipramine, clomipramine, several SSRIs) show significant action onCO2-induced panic hyperreactivity(Pernaet al., 2002). Relatively small groups (20patients per treatment arm) are sufficient to provide satisfactory predictiveresults.SomemorechallengetestsusedinanxietydisorderareshowninTable5.3.TheCO2inhalation challengeandsodium lactate infusion challengeparadigmsshow high specificity for panic disorder but less sensitivity than thecholecystokinin(CCK)ormethyl-chlorophenylpiperazine(mCPP)challengetests, which are also able to provoke panic symptoms and anxiety in healthyvolunteers.Flumazenil– a benzodiazepine antagonist – can provoke panicattacks in some panic disorder patients but with lower sensitivity than sodiumlactate infusion, CO2or CCK.The alpha-2-adrenoreceptor antagonistyohimbineincreases adrenergicactivity and may provoke anxiety and panic symptoms in patients but no oronly mild symptoms in healthy volunteers.

Only limited data areavailable about potential antipanic compounds with mechanisms of actiondifferent from those of SSRIs and benzodiazepines, such as the GABAergicanticonvulsant including vigabatrin (Zwanzgeret al., 2001). A comprehensivehypothesis suggests that both CO2and lactate induce panic states by triggeringa suffocation false-alarm in individuals with a hypersensitive ‘suffocationdetector’. An advantage of the CO2and the CCK challenge paradigms is theirrelatively good tolerability: both methods provoke a panic attack for 1–2 min(which is dose-dependent in the case of CCK), i.e. much shorter than a ‘real’panic attack. The discomfort caused by mCPP or lactate extends much longer,leading to higher dropout rates among both patients or healthy volunteers afterthe first and before the second challenge test in a crossover study design.Thescopolamine challengeparadigm is a frequently used model for theinvestigation of impairment of attention and memory, and for modeling some188PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 5. 3Challenge tests in anxiety disordersPanicSocialphobiaGeneralizedanxietydisorderPost-traumaticstress disorderObsessive–compulsivedisorderCCK-4, CCK-8,pentagastrin++++++Sodium lactate++++/\u0002\u0002/+\u0002CO2+++++\u0002\u0002Flumazenil+\u0002/+??mCPP+++++++prolactin andcortisolresponse+++Fenfluramine+/\u0002+++prolactinresponseYohimbine++++\u0002+++Data from: Charneyet al., 1989; Targum, 1990; Tanceret al., 1994; Pottset al., 1996; vanVlietetal., 1997; Strohleet al., 1998; Goddardet al., 1999; Southwicket al., 1999; Couplandet al., 2000;Rinneet al., 2000; Jettyet al., 2001; Bellet al., 2002.+++, strong predictive value, challenge-paradigm-provoked panic/anxiety symptoms areattenuated by different compunds; ++, modest predictive value, data suggest attenuation ofchallenge-paradigm-provoked panic/anxiety symptoms by a few compunds; +, weak predictivevalue, data suggest weak attenuation of challenge-paradigm-provoked panic/anxiety symptoms;\u0002,no predictive value; +/\u0002, inconclusive data; ?, no data available."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. Effects of oxiracetam in this paradigm weredemonstrated in a placebo-controlled crossover study: this nootropic drugattenuated the negative effects of scopolamine on cognitive performance, with astatistically significant difference from placebo at a dose of 1600 mg on delayedrecall of word lists; it also showed dose-related antagonism of scopolamine-induced impairments on semantic memory and attention (Predaet al., 1993).A promising approach is to study the effects of a scopolamine challenge onperformance in a face-name-associative encoding paradigm, with functionalMRI brain scanning providing a direct signal of the activity of the anatomicregions involved. In a crossover placebo-controlled trial with 0.4 mg ofscopolamine and 1.0 mg of lorazepam in healthy volunteers, significantdecreases were seen in both the extent and magnitude of activation withinthe hippocampal, fusiform and inferior prefrontal brain regions (Sperlinget al.,2002), which may mimic some of the alterations typical of Alzheimer’s disease.General Remarks on PoC StudiesProof-of-concept studies with a new compound are recommended providedthat:(1) The scientific basis of a compound is sound and its basic pharmacokineticparameters look promising.(2) The compound is novel and may lead to a truly innovative treatment.(3) Early exploratory data are required and sufficient for a go/no-go decision.Pharmacological and methodological requirements to launch PoC trials areas follows:.The modeling of a new – hypothetical – pharmacological action can bebased on a well-defined homogeneous population representing a highlyhomogeneous diagnostic category, possibly characterized by well-definedbiomarker(s)..There are well-defined, valid endpoints (biomarkers and/or clinicalmeasures) to assess the hypothetical action of the investigated compound.Although biomarkers are preferred in PoC trials, the number of thesemarkers is limited in psychopharmacology; for this reason clinical outcomesare often used as endpoints in PoC trials..The detectable signal provides sufficient qualitative or quantitativeinformation about the effect of the new compound to allow reliable go/no-go decisions about further development..In view of the limited sample size of PoC trials, minimization of bias andcontrol of unspecific effects are essential; double-blind, randomized,placebo-controlled studies are the rule.CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY189"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":".Approachable methodology is required for PoC studies. Close collaborationbetween the study sponsor and the research institutes providing the researchmethodology is mandatory.The combination of sophisticated challenge paradigms with biomarkerdetection provides new and technically advanced quantitative opportunitiesfor PoC trials. However, objective and balanced evaluation of PoC and PoMparadigms sometimes may be hindered by publication bias: trials with negativeor inconclusive outcome tend to be published less frequently than studies withpositive outcome, a fact that can mislead readers with regard to the predictivevalidity of certain models.5.5.3 LATER PHASE II (IIb) AND III TRIALSOverviewLate Phase II (sometimes called IIb) trials are aimed at identifying the optimaldose to be used in Phase III trials and, ideally, to identify those compoundsthat will not make it through the next phase of development. Typically, thesetrials are double-blind and have placebo controls. Compared with Phase Itrials, where the primary objective is to establish the tolerability limits of a newcompound, Phase II type trials are dedicated to establish efficacy data inpatients. This includes clarifying the effective and safe dosage range for singleand repeated administration, defining the precise pattern of action, includingside effects under hospital and outpatient conditions, and the question as towhether the new substance possesses sufficient advantages over existingdrugs to make its introduction on the market medically and commerciallyadvisable.Phase III studies represent the confirmatory phase of drug development,which takes several years and usually involves several thousand patients atmultiple trial centers. Large patient numbers are required in these trials toprovide convincing documentation of clinical efficacy and safety, a morecomplete adverse event profile and covariates and estimates of variability indose–response relationship due to individual differences in pharmacokineticsand pharmacodynamics. They are aimed at definitively determining a drug’seffectiveness and side-effect profile. Most of these studies are double-blind andplacebo-controlled, sometimes with the option of open-label long-termextensions.Dose^ResponseTrialsA typical feature of Phase IIb are dose–response trials regarding a drug’ssafety, efficacy and side effects. No single study design can address all aspectsof dose–response relationships for a new drug, and so a number of different190PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"trials are needed, each supplying complementary information. Multiple-doserandomized clinical trials (RCTs) can be particularly rich sources ofinformation because they compare different dosages of the test drugconcurrently in the same study. In addition, optimal dosage schedules andtherapeutic dose ranges for a new drug must be determined in different patientpopulations. Study designs that compare either different fixed doses or differentdose ranges of a drug are used to obtain this information.Fixed-dose (Dose-finding) DesignsFixed-dose studiesusing multiple dose arms have gained popularity forevaluating dose–response relationships. A fixed-dose design can be implemen-ted if the patients to be studied are diagnostically homogeneous and if theirtherapeutic responses are expected to be similar. Multiple fixed-dose trials areoften used to establish optimal ‘effectiveness’, i.e. an optimal balance betweenefficacy and safety of a drug. Fixed-dose study designs have some obviousadvantages over flexible-dose approaches:.It is not necessary to determine or assume milligram equivalence betweenthe experimental and the reference drugs used..Dosage and time factors are independent of each other so that time toresponse can be assessed better..It is possible to determine, within the range of the doses studied, an optimalfixed dose for the new drug, allowing the study of the relationship of plasmadrug concentrations to both clinical response and side effects.On the other hand, multiple fixed-dose designs have one definite drawback:because the doses cannot be adjusted to the individual patients’ needs, the riskof patients dropping out of a study, due to insufficient efficacy or significantadverse events, particularly in the first few weeks of treatment, is relativelyhigh.Some typical, published examples of multiple fixed-dose studies are:(1) A trial comparing 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/day of citalopram and placebo inthe treatment of moderate-to-severe major depression. This study showedthat the 40 and 60 mg dose arms had significantly superior efficacy incomparison with placebo (Feighner and Overo, 1999).(2) A trial comparing daily doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg sertraline with placebofor 12 weeks in patients with panic disorder. No consistent evidence of adose–response effect was found because all three doses of sertralineproduced significant efficacy compared with placebo and, surprisingly,there was no significant between-dose difference with regard todiscontinuations due to adverse events (Asheikhet al., 2000).CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY191"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"(3) A four-arm trial of fluoxetine in the treatment of OCD designed tocompare 20, 40 and 60 mg/day of fluoxetine and placebo during a 13-weekperiod.

Based on the results of this three-arm fixed-dose andsimilar trials, the recommended dose in this indication is 20 mg offluoxetine (Steineret al., 1995).These examples demonstrate the heuristic value of fixed-dose comparativestudies, which admittedly do not reproduce clinical reality, characterized byindividual dose adjustment according to patient response.Dose-titration DesignsDose-titration studies, i.e. trials with adaptation of doses to the needs ofindividual patients, are a closer approximation to actual clinical practice andarguably can provide a better assessment of dosage and therapeutic benefit of adrug for patient populations treated in usual practice settings. This approach ispreferable if the homogeneity of a patient population cannot be assumeda priori(e.g. inclusion of patients with rapid cycling, non-rapid cycling,euphoria or mixed states in a study of bipolar mania), or if the severity ofsymptomatology varies within a very wide range. Advantages of a dose-titration design are as follows:.Individual dose titration to a desired clinical effect, or until side effectsoccur, mirrors the actual clinical management of patients..Use of both a placebo and individually optimized reference controltreatment allows an estimation of what has been termed ‘assay sensitivity’..The design provides a more realistic answer to the question of whether thenew medication is comparable to or better than a currently available one interms of its therapeutic effect and side effects.Limitations of dose-titration designs are:.Dose titration makes it impossible to determine, within a single study,whether there is one optimal dosage within the range studied;.Differences that are attributed to dose may be a function of time. Time anddose factors are ‘confounded’, therefore flexible-dose designs do not allow192PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"reliable assessment of the relationship of plasma drug concentrations andclinical response..Correlation of dose and response may well show that those patients whoreceived the highest dose of a drug showed the poorest response (inverteddose–response relationship) because the doses are likely to be increased ifpatients do not respond at lower doses.To overcome some of these limitations, a fixed dose-titration schedule can beimplemented in the beginning of a flexible-dose trial in order to reach aminimum effective dose for each patient, followed by a flexible dose-titrationschedule. Use of titration points, anchored to a clinical assessment (e.g. forcedtitration to the next level in the case of Clinical Global Impression severityscores of53), makes the titration schedule and the results more homogeneousand tends to unify investigators’ judgments (for details see Marte ́nyiet al.,2002).Concentration-controlled StudiesConcentration-controlled study designs (Peck, 1990) have been advocated as amore cost-effective and efficient alternative to standard clinical trials toinvestigate the clinical pharmacology, safety and efficacy of an investigationaldrug, especially during early stages of development. This approach is based onthe assumption that the plasma concentrations of a drug correlate moremeaningfully with clinical responses than do dosages. There are, however, anumber of limitations to a concentration-controlled study approach inpsychopharmacology. Psychotropic drugs are lipophilic and show highbrain/plasma concentration ratios; as a consequence, the pharmacokineticprofile measured in peripheral compartments (i.e. plasma drug levels) is lessinformative than in the case of drugs with primarily peripheral action.Concentration-controlled approaches are recognized to be clinically relevant inthe case of some anticonvulsants and lithium used in affective disorders. In thecase of antipsychotics and antidepressants, drug plasma level determinationsare relevant if compliance needs to be checked but are not generally consideredhelpful to determine optimal dosage ranges.5.5.4 PHASE IV TRIALSAfter a new drug has been approved by health authorities and launched innational markets, pharmaceutical companies usually conduct numerousfurther studies of its therapeutic performance in more extended patientpopulations. Some typical clinical and scientific goals pursued in Phase IVtrials are:CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY193"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":".Dosing strategies different from the administration schedules established inpre-registration trials (e.g. use of high doses of antipsychotics in treatment-resistant patients)..Combination strategies to assess the benefits and risks of treatment with anew drug if added on to an established administration regimen (e.g. intreatment-resistant patients, bipolar disorder, etc.)..Treatment of patient groups with specific sociodemographic or medicalcharacteristics (geriatric populations, patients suffering from comorbidity,e.g. HIV, renal or hepatic impairment, diabetes)..Treatment of patients suffering from psychiatric and similar comorbidity,especially alcohol or drug dependence, who are usually excluded from PhaseI, II and III trials..Treatment of patients with high suicidal risk who are excluded from Phase I,II and III trials, especially from placebo-controlled studies..Treatment of female patients during pregnancy or lactation because bothconditions are primary exclusion criteria in Phase I–III trials.Furthermore, clinical trials are performed in various cultural andgeographical settings. Transcultural differences may play a significant role indrug efficacy: e.g. oriental populations require much lower doses ofantipsychotic drugs compared with Caucasian patient populations. Phase IVtrials also may be performed to explore possible novel uses for compoundsapproved and marketed in other indications (e.g. treatment of anxietydisorders with antidepressants, treatment of bipolar disorder with anti-convulsants, etc.).Another important topic for Phase IV arepredictor studies(see Spiegel, 1996,pp. 143–153). Because prescribing clinicians are highly interested in knowingwhich particular patient population or subpopulation is most likely to benefitfrom a treatment, retrospective analyses of large data sets typically collected inPhase III and prospective Phase IV trials provide opportunities to characterizethe most likely responders and non-responders to a given medication. Finally,thelong-term safetyof a new drug is another topic usually studied in Phase IV.Large-scale trials, with simple designs adapted to real-life conditions, are keycontributors to post-marketing surveillance (PMS) programs. If needed,randomized controlled clinical trials or case–control studies (Section 5.4.9)can provide comparative data about predefined specific adverse events of drugs(e.g. sexual dysfunction evoked by SSRIs; weight gain and/or diabetes inducedby atypical antipsychotics).Phase IV trials must be conducted according to the same ethical, scientificand Good Clinical Practice standards as those required in Phase I–III studies.A more detailed account on PMS studies can be found in a chapter by Hollisteret al.(1994).194PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"5.6 SYMPTOM ASSESSMENTThe therapeutic effects of psychopharmaceuticals are expressed as changes inwell-being and behavior. The clinical testing of new substances thereforeinvolves the reliable determination of these modifications in a form that cansubsequently undergo statistical analysis. Three basic types of methods areavailable for this purpose: questioning of the patients themselves (or otherprocedures to determine subjective effects); behavioral observations of variousdegrees of complexity; and test procedures for specific mental functions.5.6.1 QUESTIONING OF PATIENTSWhenever possible, the treated patients should be the first source ofinformation about a drug effect. Depending on the nature of a psychiatricdisorder, questioning a patient can be difficult or even impossible but it isessential in the case of depressive patients, neurotics and many schizophrenics.Only the patients themselves can give information on how they feel, theiranxieties, hopes, etc., and in addition many side effects of psychopharmaceu-ticals are exclusively of a subjective nature. In addition, some rating scalesfocusing on behavior also include items that have to be scored on the basis ofthe patient’s own statements. Scales of various types are available for thequantification of statements made by patients (seeECDEU Asessment Manual,1976; CIPS, 1986). Further methods are referenced in a book edited bySartorius and Ban (1986). A detailed source of the standard rating instrumentsused across psychopharmacology is available in the book by Sajatovic andRamirez 2002.5.6.2 OBSERVATION OF BEHAVIORThe behavior of a patient under hospital conditions can be observed by nursingstaff, doctors or observers specially engaged for this purpose. In particular,nursing staff who see patients in their own environment for days and weeks canreliably determine if and to what extent they engage in activities, whether theymake contacts with other patients or tend to keep to themselves, and how theyreact to questions, requests and other contacts. These are all features that makeit possible to evaluate and, to some extent, quantify the need for nursing andthe patient’s social behavior and mood, although it must be borne in mind thatpersonal likes and dislikes play a direct role even in apparently objectiveobservations. Difficult, quarrelsome, withdrawn patients are generally lessfavorably assessed and contaminations may occur between various assessmentlevels. Moreover, times of observation and the conditions under which apatient is observed fluctuate from day to day. It is therefore possible to engageCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY195"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"independent observers, uninvolved in the day-to-day nursing schedule, to ratethe patients under conditions that are as standardized as possible and atpredetermined times. In the case of outpatient treatment, relatives and othercontact persons can observe the behavior of patients. Relatives are under-standably often by no means neutral observers and therefore cannot alwaysmake reliable observations. In many instances it would also endanger thedoctor–patient relationship if a system of communication were to be set upwith the relatives behind the patient’s back. Nevertheless, standardizedbehavioral observations in the habitual environment have great value in thecase of children, e.g. in the documentation of drug therapy of attention deficithyperactivity disorder (Whalenet al., 1979; MTA Cooperative Group, 1999),and should also play an important role in the psychopharmacology of elderlypatients with age-associated cognitive deficits (Crooket al., 1983; Coperet al.,1987).5.6.3 RATING SCALESOwing to the lack of well-defined, broadly established and valid biologicalmarkers in psychiatric diseases, the clinical assessment of patients is routinelybased on different rating scales. When selecting a scale for use in theinvestigation of the effect of a drug on a particular disorder, some potentialsources of error should be kept in mind:.Most psychiatric rating scales only cover pathologically orientated itemsand, in the event of clinical improvement, merely indicate reduction inpathology or, in the best case, normalization. What they do not record arepositive, desirable forms of behavior that are also present or can supplantpathological characteristics in the course of therapy..The individual items within a scale are not independent of one another and,for this reason, it is unlikely that one characteristic will change in isolation.However, by dividing up the observed behaviors into several differentlyformulated questionnaire items, one may create the wrong impression ofindependence and the equal significance of symptoms..Adding up the scores of several items to form sum scores can givemisleading figures as estimates of the severity of an illness. Because theindividual items are not independent of each other and not equivalent,caution must be adopted when arriving at and interpreting sum scores.Similar sum scores in different patients do not necessarily indicatecomparable psychopathological conditions..Rating scales can flatten out the clinical situation. An event that wouldstand out as a dramatic situation in a case history may be leveled out whenrating scales are used.196PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":".Individual behavior that is part of a sensible whole is artificially brokendown and looked at in isolation, at the risk of becoming incomprehensible.Despite these limitations, rating scales today are the preferred clinicalrecording instrument in most areas of psychopharmacology. In order tocancel out the disadvantages, they are often combined with brief case historiesor occasionally with symptom lists, which can be prepared individually foreach patient.Psychiatric Diagnostic ScalesThese are instruments developed to identify specific psychiatric disorders. Mostof these scales are based on a structured or semi-structured interview lastingsome 60–90 min. Structured interviews contain a mix of open-ended and closedquestions. Open-ended questions are essential for the validity of a diagnosticprocedure; closed questions support the reliability and the standardization ofdiagnostic tools. The primary goal for the use of diagnostic scales is to reducethe variance within samples caused by diagnostic differences, i.e. to createhomogeneous patient populations included in clinical trials.General Diagnostic InstrumentsThe most commonly used semi-structured diagnostic scale is theStructuredClinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders(SCID; Firstet al., 1997). Aclinical version of the SCID (SCID-CV) is designed for use in clinical settingsand covers the most commonly seen diagnoses according to DSM-IV. Theresearch version of the SCID includes ratings for different subtypes, severityand course specifiers of mental disorders. The SCID-CV contains six modules:(A) Mood Episodes; (B) Psychotic Symptoms; (C) Psychotic Disorders;(D) Mood Disorders; (E) Substance Use Disorders; (F) Anxiety and OtherDisorders.TheMini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview(MINI) is a shortstructured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders.With an administration time of approximately 15 min, it was designed to meetthe need for a short but accurate structured psychiatric interview formulticenter clinical trials and epidemiology studies, and to be used as a firststep in outcome tracking in non-research clinical settings (Sheehanet al., 1998).5.6.4 DIAGNOSIS-SPECIFIC RATING INSTRUMENTSDepression ScalesThe two most widely used scales for the measurement of severity ofdepression are theHamilton Rating Scale for Depression(HRSD) and theCLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY197"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale(MADRS) (Hamilton, 1959;Montgomery and Asberg, 1979).The HRSD is an observer-rated scale that consists of 17 items (21 items in amore recent version). The instrument was originally developed for diagnosticpurposes, specifically in depression, but its main use was and still is in clinicaltrials of all kinds, including drug studies in patients with schizophrenia, bipolardisorder and other disorders. Use of a standardized, semi-structured interviewguide for the HRSD (e.g. Williams, 1988) is recommended to improve theaccuracy of ratings in large multicenter trials. Three different subscales (seeTable 5.4) have been developed based on HRSD items (Bechet al., 1984; Maieret al., 1988; Gibbonset al., 1993) and they are claimed to be more sensitive totherapeutic changes than the full scale.The MADRS is a ten-item investigator-rated instrument for the assessmentof depressive symptoms. It focuses on symptoms of sadness, lassitude,pessimistic thoughts and suicidality; in contrast to the HRSD, no items arededicated to the somatic aspects of depression.TheRaskin Depression Rating Scale(Raskinet al., 1969) is a very simpleclinician-rated three-item instrument for non-psychotic, non-bipolar depres-sion. The source of information may include a patient interview, nursingreports and observations made during the interview. Administration of theRaskin Scale is very quick but, owing to a lack of specificity, it is recommendedthat it be combined with other, more specific instruments, e.g. some self-administered scales. The structure of the Raskin scale is similar to that of theCovi Anxiety Scale (Lipman, 1982) and parallel use of the two scales allows theprimary pathology to be delineated in cases of comorbidity of depression andanxiety: a higher score on the Covi Anxiety Scale argues for an anxietyindication and a higher Raskin score indicates depressive symptoms.TheBeck Depression Inventoryis a 21-item self-rating scale to assess keysymptoms of depression such as mood deterioration, pessimism, guilt, self-punishment, self-dislike, self-accusations, suicidality, crying, irritability, social198PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 5.4The three subscales of HRSDGibbons (HRSD8)Bech (HRSD6)Maier (HRSD6)Depressed moodDepressed moodDepressed moodFeelings of guiltFeelings of guiltFeelings of guiltWork and activityWork and activityWork and activityPsychic anxietyPsychic anxietyPsychic anxietyAgitationRetardationRetardationSomatic anxietySomatic symptomsAgitationSuicideGenital symptoms"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"withdrawal, indecisiveness, change in body image, work difficulty, insomnia,fatigue, change of appetite, weight loss, somatic preoccupation, loss of libido(Becket al., 1988). The cognitive performance subscale may be particularlyuseful in the case of trials among elderly patients, or as a screening tool in thecase of comorbid depression and somatic diseases (e.g. to detect cognitivedecline in cases of hypertensive or diabetic encephalopathy, HIV, etc.).TheZung Depression Scale(Zung, 1972) has a patient-rated version and anidentical investigator-rated version. The instrument is heavily focused onsomatic symptoms such as sleep disturbance, weight loss, constipation,tachycardia, fatigue and decreased appetite.TheCenter of Epidemiologic Studies Depressionscale (CES-D) was originallydeveloped for the Community Mental Health Assessment, a population-basedstudy of depressive symptoms. The 20-question survey contains items chosenfrom other validated mental health instruments designed to measure depressivesymptoms. The questions assess symptoms experienced in the past week using ascale from zero to three, with the highest possible score of 60 (representingmore depressive symptoms). The original four-factor structure included 16 ofthe 20 CES-D items: depressed affect (blues, depressed, lonely, cry, sad),positive affect (good, hopeful, happy, enjoy), somatic and retarded activity(bothered, appetite, effort, sleep, get going) and interpersonal feelings(unfriendly, dislike) (Radloff, 1977).TheInventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Report(IDS-SR) is a 29-item self-rating scale for the evaluation of depressive symptom severity. Eachitem is rated on a defined four-step scale (0–3). Analysis of sensitivity to changein symptom severity in an open-label trial showed that the IDS-SR was highlycorrelated with the 17-item HRSD (Rushet al., 1996).A specific depressed population was originally targeted with the develop-ment of theEdinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This was designed as ascreening tool to be used in women during the postnatal period. The scale canbe completed in 5 min. The ten-item self-rating scale showed sensitivity andreliability among non-postpartum females and in males as well (Coxet al.,1987). Another specific depressed population was addressed with thedevelopment of theCalgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia(CDSS;Addingtonet al., 1993). The CDSS comprises nine items selected from theHRSD) and the Present State Examination (PSE), and assesses symptoms ofdepression at any stage of schizophrenia.Anxiety ScaleTheHamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety(HRSA) is the most widely usedinstrument for the assessment of anxiety symptoms in patients suffering fromdiagnosed anxiety disorders. The HRSA consists of 14 items and focuses to agreat extent (7/14 items) on somatic symptoms (Hamilton, 1959).CLINICAL RESEARCH IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY199"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"TheCovi Anxiety Scaleis a simple three-item scale for the assessment ofseverity of anxiety symptoms. The scale measures three dimensions: verbalreport, behavior and somatic symptoms of anxiety. Administration of the CoviScale is very easy but, owing to a lack of specificity, it is recommended that itbe combined with other, more specific instruments (e.g. some self-administeredscale or the HRSA; see Lipman, 1982).TheLiebowitz Social Anxiety Scale(LSAS) measures fear, anxiety andavoidant behavior in 24 commonly feared social situations and performances.There are 13 performance-related items and 11 items that rate the socialsituations (Heimberget al., 1999). The LSAS is the standard establishedoutcome measure in most of the pivotal trials for social anxiety. Cut-offs of 30for social anxiety disorder and 60 for its generalized subtype on the LSAS totalscores represent a balance of specificity and sensitivity. There are two validversions of the LSAS: a clinician-administered version and a self-rating version(Frescoet al., 2001).ThePanic Disorder Severity Scale(PDSS) is an investigator-rated instru-ment, that contains items assessing the severity of seven dimensions of panicdisorder and associated symptoms: frequency of panic attacks, distress duringpanic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobic fear and avoidance, intero-ceptive fear and avoidance, impairment of work functioning, impairment ofsocial functioning. The PDSS is a simple, sensitive instrument for clinicians torate the severity in patients with established diagnoses of panic disorder (Shearet al., 1997).TheSpielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory(SSTAI) is a self-ratingassessment that differentiates the state anxiety experienced during specificsituations from chronic, situation-independent anxiety symptoms (traitanxiety). The SSTAI has 20 items covering statements on feelings ‘‘rightnow’’ and 20 items with statements related to feelings ‘‘in general’’ (Spielberger,1984). The SSTAI is a useful screening tool, as well as in clinical trials of anxietydisorders or comorbid anxiety accompanying somatic disorders.TheFear Questionnaire(FQ) is a 24-item self-rated scale used mainly forassessments in phobias. One component of the scale evaluates phobic behaviorassociated with a number of situations, whereas another component assessessymptoms of anxiety, depression and general distress caused by phobia (Marksand Mathews, 1979). The social phobia, strongly related to social anxiety, andmost of the subscales are significantly related to neuroticism. The FQ has beenutilized in several trials of social anxiety disorder.TheHospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) is a 14-item self-reportscale that was developed originally to indicate the possible presence of anxietyand depressive states in the setting of medical outpatients between 16 and 65years (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). The HADS is widely utilized in clinicaltrials of treatment of comorbid depression and/or anxiety symptoms in somaticdisorders (stroke, cardiac disease, cancer, etc.).200PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) ScalesTheTreatment Outcome PTSD Scale(TOP-8) is a clinician-rated instrumentthat measures the presence and severity of eight PTSD symptoms that occurfrequently in PTSD patients and are sensitive to treatment. The scale wasdeveloped from the Structured Interview for PTSD (SI-PTSD; Davidsonet al.,1997), an alternative to the SCID. The TOP-8 questions are representative ofthe three major PTSD symptom dimensions (intrusive, avoidant andhyperarousal symptoms). Each symptom is rated on a defined step scale(0–4), with a high numeric rating indicating greater symptom severity(Davidson and Colket, 1997). The TOP-8 has proved sensitive to changes ofPTSD symptoms in studies with antidepressants.TheClinician-Administered PTSD Scale(CAPS) for DSM-IV is a lengthystructured interview based on DSM-IV that assesses the presence and severityof PTSD and associated symptoms. The CAPS is available in two versions: theCAPS-DX (also known as the CAPS-1), which is used as a diagnosticinstrument as well as a measure of current severity of PTSD; and the CAPS-SX(also known as the CAPS-2), which provides a rating of the severity of currentsymptoms during the past week. A CAPS total score can be drawn from eitherversion and is based on the patient’s response to 25 questions that assess thefrequency and severity of current PTSD symptoms on a scale of 0–4. A highnumeric rating reflects a greater degree of symptom severity (Blakeet al., 1990,1995).TheDavidson Trauma Scale(DTS) is a 17-item self-rated instrument thatallows the patient to assess the level of distress caused by various symptoms.Patients are asked to rate both the frequency and severity of each item on ascale of 0–4, with a higher numeric rating reflecting a greater degree of distress(Davidsonet al., 1997).Additional trauma-related rating instruments are discussed in detail in Briere(1997).Obsessive^Compulsive Disorder ScalesTheYale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale(YBOCS) is an OCD-specificinstrument in which ratings are based mainly on patients’ self-report in a semi-structured interview. Five items are addressed to rate the severity of obsessivesymptoms and five items to assess the compulsive symptoms (Goodmannet al.,1989). The YBOCS is the best-established and standard instrument to diagnoseOCD; it has been used in most of the clinical trials in this area.Psychosis ScalesTheBrief Psychiatric Rating Scale(BPRS; Overall and Gorham, 1962) is an 18-item rating instrument covering a wide range of psychopathology.

Ratings are based on a semi-structured clinical interview and anysupporting available clinical information. Subscores of the PANSS arePositive, Negative, General Psychopathology and Affective Symptomscomposite scores (Kay and Opler, 1986). Positive and negative syndromes,together with depression and excitement, comprise the fundamental sympto-matic components of schizophrenic patients as described by Kraepelin (Kayand Sandyk, 1991). The PANSS is almost routinely used today in clinical trialswith antipsychotic drugs.TheKrawiecka–Goldberg Scale(or Manchester Scale) is a brief ten-item scalefor assessment of changes in the clinical status of patients suffering frompsychosis. The items include depression, anxiety, delusions and hallucinations,incoherence, flattened affect, poverty of speech and psychomotor retardation.The absence of items typical of schizoaffective and manic psychoses limits theuse of this instrument. It is, however, useful for follow-up of inpatients andoutpatients for longer periods of time (Krawieckaet al., 1977).Mania ScalesTheYoung Mania Rating Scale(YMRS) comprises 11 items corresponding tothe published core symptoms of mania. Four items are graded on a scale of 0–8(irritability, speech, thought content, disruptive/aggressive behavior) and havedouble weight; the remaining seven items are graded on a scale of 0–4 (elevatedmood, increased motor activity, sexual interest, sleep, language thoughtdisorder, appearance and insight). The scale is easy to use and suitable forserial ratings, even every second day (Younget al., 1978).TheBech–Rafelson Mania Scalealso comprises 11 items. It was originallydeveloped to cover the whole affective spectrum in combination with theHRSD. All items are rated on a scale of 0–4. The last item is dedicated to thework/activity ability, with a separate first rating and follow-up assessment part(Bechet al., 1979).TheManic State Rating Scaleis a clinician-rated 26-item instrument.

Prospective LCM charts are moredetailed and include sleep, comorbid symptoms and menstrual cycle data, forexample, in addition to mood and functioning. Both charts include space torecord significant life events and rate their impact on the patient. Life chartingmethodology allows the bipolar nature of bipolar disorder to be approachedover time rather than just the changes measured by other instruments specifiedfor mania or depression (HRSD, YMRS, etc.).Dementia ScalesTheAlzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale(ADAS) is a 21-item scale with 11items assessing cognitive–behavioral performances (spoken language ability,comprehension of spoken language, recall of test instructions, difficulties inword-finding, following commands, naming objects and figures, constructivecapabilities, ideational praxis, orientation, word recall and word recognition)and 10 items for non-cognitive–behavioral disturbances (tearful, depressedmood, concentration/distractibility, uncooperativeness, delusions, hallucina-tions, pacing, increased motor activity, tremor and change in appetite). Ratingof the individual items varies: several cognitive items require activeparticipation of the patient, e.g. drawing or copying geometric forms on asheet of paper, whereas other items require assessment by the personadministering the test. The ADAS is not a diagnostic scale but an instrumentapplicable to patients already diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer’sdementia (Rosenet al., 1984).TheMini-Mental State Evaluation(MMSE) is a very popular instrument andincludes components of orientation, calculation, registration, memory andpraxis. It required active participation by patients who have to perform anumber of simple tasks. The MMSE provides a rough estimate of cognitivedecline; it is useful for screening purposes because it takes a very short time toperform (Folsteinet al., 1975).TheBehavioral Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease(BEHAVE-AD) scalecomprises 25 items rated on a scale of 0–3.

SCHMIDT6.1 INTRODUCTIONThe last two decades have seen the introduction of several distinct ‘functional’imaging techniques that can be used to investigate centrally active compoundsworking in the brainin vivo. These techniques provide windows through whichto observe phenomena in the intact and fully functional central nervous system.When applied to studies with human volunteers or patients one can obtaininformation that cannot be extrapolated from animal models, and from areassuch as the brain and neurotransmitter systems that would otherwise beinaccessiblein vivo. When combined with peripheral measurements andobjective and subjective assessments of behavior, these methods can be usedto explore how psychopharmaceuticals influence central nervous sytem activityand behavior. Moreover, compounds with a known mechanism of action canbe employed as tools to understand how different elements of the centralnervous system work.The imaging techniques that will be discussed are emerging fromdevelopments in radiochemistry, imaging physics and computer science.These methods detect signals that depend on the metabolic and physicochem-ical state of tissues and tissue components and can be sensitive to change inthese signals over short time intervals. As a consequence, they are sensitive to amuch larger range of physiological conditions, tissue properties and elementsPsychopharmacology, Fourth Edition. By R.

It is this greater sensitivity to change and the wide range ofbiological phenomena that can be explored that has given rise to the term‘functional’ imaging. As a class, these methods can detect signals reflectingdrug disposition and/or activity throughout the brain and therefore offersuperior spatial information and resolution relative to electroencephalography,another principal method of assessing the effect of psychoactive compounds onbrain function (Chapter 3). The temporal resolution of these techniquesdepends on the detection method chosen and experimental design; however, allcurrently available methods require integration of information over timee ́poques one or more orders of magnitude greater than that achieved withelectroencephalography.Although many reports are being published with these methods, it isimportant to realize that technical execution of these studies, data acquisitionand image processing are complex and functional imaging methods are stillvery much evolving. Reasonable interpretation of the data depends onknowledge of the performance characteristics of the methods, skilfulexperimental design and realizing that there are significant gaps in ourunderstanding of the path from drug action to image signal.6.2 NEUROIMAGING TECHNIQUES6.2.1 FUNCTIONAL IMAGING WITH RADIOISOTOPESThe types of signals measured in functional imaging studies fall into two broadcategories: compounds labeled with radioisotopes and compounds thatgenerate a paramagnetic signal. The compounds may be biologically activemolecules such as glucose derivatives, water or hemoglobin; small syntheticmolecules such as benzamides; or larger synthetic molecules such as technetium(99Tc) chelates. This section will introduce some of the concepts involved in theapplication of radiolabeled compounds to the study of psychopharmaceuticals.Radioisotope-labeled biomolecules have been used for decades to dissect andmeasure metabolic pathways at the molecular, cellular and tissue level.Radiolabeled pharmaceuticals permit quantitation of signals expressed as lowas the nanomolar range and, as such, are particularly useful for drugdistribution and receptor occupancy studies. The isotopes that are used forinvivobrain imaging are of two types: single-photon emitting and positronemitting. These two types of isotopes require different signal detection systemsand selection of the type of isotope depends on the compound being labeledand the intended use. The isotopes used in these studies are a select group ofradionuclides that can be readily synthesized and then incorporated into acarrier molecule that can be used safely forin vivostudies in humans. These208PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"isotopes decay, and this process generates gamma photons of sufficient energythat they project outside the body where the photons can be detected by ascintillation camera. In some cases the rapid decay or ‘half-life’ of the isotopepermits serial studies to be obtained within a subject on a given day while thetotal radiation exposure is limited. Table 6.1 lists the most frequently usedisotopes for psychopharmaceutical studies.For studies of psychotropic drugs, the metal99Tc has most commonly beenchelated with hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO). Following injec-tion, 70% of this substance is transported across the intact blood–brain barrierand ‘trapped’. As a consequence, images of the distribution of the tracer can beused to estimate relative cerebral blood flow. The heavier halides of iodine(123I) and bromine (76Br), can be substituted for their stable isotopecounterparts in pharmaceuticals or derivatives that include iodine or brominein their structure. Fluorine-18 (18F) can be substituted for19F or, in selectedcases (such as 2-deoxyglucose), for a hydrogen atom. Carbon is ubiquitous inendogenous compounds and drugs, therefore the carbon isotope11C is a verycommonly used label following an isotopic substitution for12C in eithernaturally occurring molecules (such as amino acids, fatty acids, or sugars) orpharmaceuticals. The very short-lived oxygen isotope15O is incorporated inwater, butanol or carbon monoxide to measure blood flow.When single-photon-emitting isotopes decay they generate a gamma photonsignal that can be detected using an Anger scintillation camera. The location orsource of the signal is determined by attaching a collimator to the camera: alead shield or septum with a geometric array of holes. These holes permit thedetection of only those photons traveling along a line within some angle of theaxis of the hole (the angle being a function of the location and geometry of thehole). The collimator therefore discriminates among photons based on theirline of travel, defining one axis of the volume of tissue from which the signalwas generated. The source of the signal is determined by back-projecting thisline when a scintillation event is detected. For imaging the brain, the camera isrotated around the head and the intersection of back-projected lines is mappedNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY209209Table 6.1Isotopes used in central nervous system studiesRadioisotopeHalf-lifeSingle-photon Emitters99Tc6 h123I13hPositron Emitters15O2.01 min11C20.5 min18F109.8 min76Br16.2 h"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"to create the two-dimensional distribution or image of the signal, as withnavigation by triangulation.Positron-emitting radionuclides differ from single-photon emitters in that apositron is emitted as part of the radioactive decay process. A positron is ananti-matter electron and when these particles meet electrons in the surroundingtissue a mutual annihilation occurs. This produces two high-energy gammaphotons that travel in opposite directions. Positron emission tomography(PET) cameras are constructed of rings of multiple scintillation detectors thatare paired diametrically. When two such opposing detectors simultaneouslydetect an event, this determines the line in space on which the annihilationoccurred, depicted in cartoon form in Fig. 6.1.

If the positron meets an electronsomewhere in the surroundings, mutual annihilation occurs (large star), producing twogamma rays that project at an angle of 1808from each other.These gamma photons canbe sensed by the detectors (triangles) arrayed in pairs around the bore of the camera.Multiple rings of these paired detectors constitute the camera.When a pair of detectorssenses photons simultaneously, this is recorded in the computer as a ‘true’coincidenceevent that occurred along the line between the detectors. If annihilation occurs outsidethe volume of space between two detectors, only one of the photons can be detectedand the event is rejected. Many millions of such events are recorded during a PET scanandused to create animage of isotope distribution"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"such signals coupled with filtering the signal for noise and correction for falseor lost counts permits an accurate mapping of the signal into image data space.Images are then created that represent the distribution of the tracer. Correctingthis for the extent to which the tissue being studied absorbs or attenuates thephoton signal (‘attenuation correction’), calculating the exposure of the tissueto the tracer estimated from blood samples (the ‘input function’) and modelingof the relative steady-state concentrations of the tracer in the different tissuecompartments can provide a quantitative estimate of the signal in thecompartment of interest.The longer half-life of single-photon-emission computed tomography(SPECT) isotopes and reduced technical requirements for imaging withSPECT make these tracers attractive for use at a very wide range of centers.Anger cameras for imaging with SPECT tracers are used at medical centersthroughout the world, making this the more accessible radioisotopetechnology. At the same time, the greater ability to quantitate the signalthrough attenuation correction, use of coincidence detection, modeling and thegreater versatility of PET isotopes for labeling (without significantly alteringthe physiological or pharmacological properties of the carrier) have led to PETimaging being more widely used as a research tool in drug development.Regardless of the tracer and camera used, the images of tracer distributionare often subjected to additional processing. Two common strategies are theco-registration of ‘functional’ images with structural images of the brain –either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized axial tomography(CAT) – to improve the measurement and localization of a signal, and warpingof individual data into a common coordinate system (such as the brain atlas byTalairach and Tournoux, 1988) to permit signal averaging across subjects.Reviews of the technology and physiology supporting these methods anddiscussion of some of the performance characteristics of these isotopes andimaging systems offer more detailed background (Phelpset al., 1986; Burnset al., 1993; Carsonet al., 1998).6.2.2 FUNCTIONAL IMAGING WITH MAGNETIC RESONANCEIn addition to radioisotope-labeled compounds, functional imaging can bedone using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and MRI. The technicalfoundations for the signal used in magnetic resonance methods involvesquantum physics. What follows is a highly simplified overview of the elementsof magnetic resonance using illustrations from classical physics. The interestedreader can find a more complete discussion of the technical foundations in arecent text devoted to this subject (Buxton, 2002).Magnetic resonance imaging ultimately depends on the observation thatnuclear particles, including protons, neutrons and electrons, have an intrinsicrotation or spin, creating an electromagnetic field. The magnetic fieldsNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY211211"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"associated with protons and neutrons can cancel each other within the atombut in the case of atoms with an odd-numbered atomic weight (such as1H,19F,or31P) the imbalance in the number of protons versus neutrons leads to a netnuclear spin or magnetic moment. As a consequence, when such an atom is inthe presence of an externally generated magnetic field, the magnetic moment ofthe particle will behave as a dipole (like a small compass needle) and align itselfin the direction of the external magnetic field. If these spinning dipoles areperturbed, such as by introducing a change in the direction of the magneticfield or adding energy to the system with another electromagnetic signal, theywill tend to rotate or ‘precess’ at an angle around an axis in the direction of theexternal magnetic field. This phenomenon can be likened to a gyroscope or atop, precessing at an angle around an axis of gravity as it spins. The frequencyof this precession (the ‘Larmor frequency’) is specific to each atom at a givenmagnetic field strength. As the atom precesses, it generates its own disturbancesin the magnetic field that can be detected as a signal at the Larmor frequency ofthe atom. In techniques involvingin vivoMRI, a device is used that hassupercooled electrical coils distributed around the bore of the scanner thatgenerate a powerful magnetic field (most commonly 1.5 Tesla for clinicalimaging, with 3.0 Tesla machines now being widely introduced), the subject lieswithin the bore of the machine in the center of the magnetic field and aradiofrequency (RF) coil is placed in some proximity to the tissue of interest.This coil provides the perturbation to initiate signal detection in the form of anRF pulse, as well as detecting the RF signal coming back from the tissue. Theinitial RF pulse used to perturb the system may be given over a broadfrequency range but particles such as protons will absorb the RF energy bandthat occurs at the same frequency as their Larmor frequency, rather like atuning fork sounding if a signal is transmitted at the same frequency for whichthe tuning fork is tuned. It is essentially that ‘sound’ and its amplitude, fromthe precessing atoms, that the RF coil receives as an indicator of the presenceand amount of particles present. For clinical imaging the magnetic field is notuniform, but is generated as a gradient. The dipoles associated with the atomsgenerate a signal specific to their location along the gradient, as the Larmorfrequency depends on the strength of the field. This permits the source of thesignal to be located in space. The RF signal detected has a complex oscillatingform that represents populations of nuclear dipoles from locations throughoutthe detection volume. This complex form is Fourier transformed from changesin signal over time to frequency values in order to map the location of thesevarious populations.Following perturbation of the system, the dipoles will return to being alignedalong the axis of the external magnetic field, referred to as relaxation. TheLarmor frequency of an atom can be slightly different depending on theenvironment of the atom, so that a1H atom or proton can have a slightlydifferent frequency depending on whether it is associated with a methyl group,212PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"hydroxy group, etc. and it is this difference or chemical shift that permits NMRimaging or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In addition, therelaxation time of protons differs depending on the environment, sothat different tissues can generate different signals depending on how theexperiment is conducted. The relaxation signal can be separated intoT1(thelongitudinal relaxation or that associated with relaxation of the signal thatoccurs along the direction of the external magnetic field) andT2andT2*components (the relaxation occurring perpendicular or transverse to thedirection of the magnetic field). TheT1andT2times vary significantly betweentissues; a selection of those for protons in brain tissues is provided in Table 6.2to illustrate these differences.These tissue-specific differences in signal behavior permit the imaging ofcontrasts and is the basis for clinical imaging and quantitation of brainvolumes in different disease states and over time. Because of the slow change inbrain structure, ‘structural’ or ‘volumetric’ MRI has limited application topharmacological studies, although changes in structure are being considered asa surrogate measure of drug/treatment effect in multiple sclerosis (Hoholet al.,1997) and Alzheimer’s disease (Fox and Freeborough, 1997; Wanget al., 2002).Subtle differences in the tissue magnetic signal are also the basis for brainblood flow or cerebral blood volume measurement using MRI. Two types ofmethods are used: those that use an exogenous contrast agent such asgadolinium chelates; and those that rely on an endogenously generated signalsuch as blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)-MRI and arterial spin-labeling.Gadolinium (Gd) has a number of unpaired electrons and in tissue causes adecrease in local relaxation time of protons associated with water. This metalcan be chelated with DTPA and this agent can be injected as an intravascularcontrast agent with a circulation half-life of approximately 1.5 h. Imaging isdone by giving this contrast agent intravenously and then estimating thecerebral blood volume (CBV) by measuring the regional decreases in the brainMRI signal compared with the pre-injection scan. In pharmacological,perceptual stimulation or behavioral activation studies the CBV is measuredduring control and experimental conditions (see Belliveauet al., 1991;Kaufmanet al., 1998). The test-retest variability of this method appears tobe good (Henryet al., 2001) and has been applied to functional imaging of theeffects of psychopharmaceuticals.NEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY213213Table 6. 2Relative relaxation parameters in human brainTissueT1(ms)T2(ms)Cerebrospinal fluid2500250Gray matter95095White matter70080"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"The BOLD-MRI approach follows changes in regional brain blood flow bydeoxyhemoglobin serving as an endogenous paramagnetic contrast agent.Local hyperemia and increases in venous blood oxygenation accompanyincreases in neuronal activity. Deoxyhemoglobin has paramagnetic propertieswhereas oxyhemoglobin does not, and the reduction in deoxyhemoglobinconcentration attendant to neuronal excitation is hypothesized to underlie thechange in water proton signal observed to occur during visual stimulationexperiments (Ogawaet al., 1992). After acquiring rapid serial MRI imagesduring stimulus on and off conditions, one can subtract the paired or averagedimages and map the region(s) in the brain where the BOLD signal has changed.This observation is being extended to investigations of cognition, perception,emotion and pain using different stimulus paradigms. Because the signaldepends on subtraction of an activated state versus control, it is not as suitedfor evaluating the effects of drugs during a resting condition and studies of theeffects of drug to date have been limited to drugs with very short half-lives or incombination with another activation protocol (see below).Arterial spin-labeling is another method and involves inducing a magnetiza-tion ‘label’ on arterial blood before entering the brain (Detreet al., 1998). Thisapproach permits quantitation of the signal by knowing the ‘input’ (theamount of magnetization induced) as well as the ‘output’ (the measured signalin brain arterial blood) and thus could be used to evaluate ‘resting’ as well aschronic changes in brain blood flow, although this technique has not been usedto date for pharmacological studies.6.3 TYPES OF FUNCTIONAL IMAGING STUDIESFunctional neuroimaging studies used to characterize psychopharmaceuticalsare generally of three classes: those that assess some aspect of brain activity ormetabolism; those that assess a specific site in the brain, such as a receptor orenzyme; and those that evaluate distribution of a drug in the brain. Theexperimental design and imaging method chosen depends on the type ofinformation on drug behavior being sought. Brain metabolism and blood-flow-based methods tend to be adopted by investigators using a neuroanatomicmodel of drug action. Such an approach is useful for exploring the effect of thedrug on behavior as mediated by specific brain regions, although such studiesmay also provide information on general behavioral states such as sedation orarousal by measuring more diffuse effects. Receptor or site-specific methodsgenerally provide less dynamic information, are most commonly applied toconfirm the site and mechanism of action of a drug and typically assume arelationship between site occupancy and pharmacological effect.To illustrate these differences, a brain activity study of patients withschizophrenia typically involves testing whether a particular brain region,214PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"perhaps in the frontal cortex, may be affected by disease process or shows achange in activity during a task different from a control subject. In contrast, astudy of patients using a dopamine system tracer would likely focus on thebasal ganglia because this brain region provides the best signal-to-noise ratiofor many dopamine system tracers. Such a study may acknowledge that basalganglia function may be germane to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia(Keshavanet al., 1998) but it does not depend on this assumption. Instead,dopamine activity in the basal ganglia serves as a surrogate for dopamineactivity throughout the brain. This differs from brain-region-specific mappingof some behavior or cognitive function, because monoamine neurons projectdiffusely throughout the brain and most likely play a more general role inmodulating behavioral states such as attention.6.3.1 MEASUREMENT OF REGIONAL BRAIN METABOLISMAssessment of brain activityin vivobegan with the pioneering work led bySeymour Kety by applying Fick’s Principle, a method of estimating the amountof blood flow through a tissue by comparing the arterial and venousconcentrations of a gas that enters into the bloodstream at a known rate.Although originally developed to estimate cardiac output, Kety and Schmidtadapted this to estimate whole brain blood flow using inert gases as a diffusiontracer (Kety and Schmidt, 1948). A student of his, Louis Sokoloff, establishedthat the glucose derivative 2-deoxyglucose radiolabeled with14C could betransported readily across the blood–brain barrier and be taken up by braincells, and thus could be used to estimate regional brain glucose metabolism. Byreplacing the hydroxy group with hydrogen on the second carbon, [14C]2-deoxyglucose is a substrate for hexokinase to form [14C]2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate but cannot serve as a substrate for isomerase, the next enzyme in theglucose metabolism pathway. Phosphorylation renders the molecule morepolar so that it is less likely to move out of the intracellular space. Moreover,dephosphorylation of glucose-6-phosphate or [18F]-2-deoxyglucose (*FDG)occurs very slowlyin vivo. As a consequence, [14C]2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphateis effectively trapped and accumulation of this product can be estimated byusing the radioactive decay signal generated by the radioisotope. By measuringthe arterial input of [14C]2-deoxyglucose, the transfer constants of glucose fromblood to tissue and the ‘isotope effect’, the glucose metabolic rate in any tissuecan be modeled (Sokoloffet al., 1977). Assessment of tracer uptake follows theinjection of isotope-labeled 2-deoxyglucose by about 45 min with14C-labeledcompound and after at least 20 min with18F-labeled compound to permitassessment at steady state. The estimate therefore integrates metabolismoccurring over as many minutes. The14C technique was developed forevaluation of brain metabolism in rats with quantitationex vivo. Theradiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose method was subsequently developed for useinNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY215215"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"vivoin humans by substituting the positron-emitting18F isotope for one of thehydrogen atoms on the 2-deoxyglucose molecule (FDG-PET) (Reivichet al.,1979). The basic model for FDG-PET is depicted in Fig. 6.2.Several distinct features of brain physiology permit application of thistechnique to the study of psychopharmaceuticals. The brain is highlydependent on glucose oxidative metabolism as a source of energy, utilizationof which is directly related to the functional activity of the nervous system.Neuronal activity has been estimated to account for 75% of oxygenconsumption in the brain. Most of this energy (80% or more) is required forrestoration and maintenance of the ionic gradients as they fluctuate withneuronal firing (Mataet al., 1980; Sokoloff, 1986). The brain has negligiblestores of glucose and relies on circulating glucose for its energy needs and anactive transport system to move glucose across the blood–brain barrier. The216PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 6.2Glucose and [18F]-2-deoxyglucose (*FDG) are depicted circulating throughthe cerebral vasculature.

The efficiency of transport across the blood–brain barrier is such that blood flow is generally not limiting for tracer deliverybut the potential for a drug to have a direct vascular effect that influences tracerdelivery should be considered.In a prototype experiment evaluating a psychoactive compound, brainmetabolism would be measured during a control condition and following acuteor chronic administration of a drug. To the extent that a drug interacts withsites that influence the excitability or inhibitory status of neurons, this can bedetected as changes in regional brain metabolism. Examples of the results ofsuch an experiment are depicted in Plate 6.1.This simple experiment can be complicated by a number of issues. First is therelationship between the time course of the imaging method and that of thedrug effect, recalling that the estimate of glucose metabolism with FDG-PETreflects an integration of tracer uptake over a period of 20 min or more. Thistime period provides ample opportunity for polysynaptic and intraneuronalevents following interaction between the drug and the primary target. Thus, ifthe extent and direction of the metabolic effect of the drug are time dependent,this information may be lost in the integrated measure. Some psychoactivedrugs have primary targets that include receptors that subtly modulate theexcitability of neurons and may be expressed at low densities diffuselythroughout the cortex (e.g. some noradrenergic receptors). Signal detection inthis situation can be difficult, given the normal levels of intrinsic corticalactivity in conscious and alert human subjects. In addition, the ‘resting’behavioral state of a conscious human has a significant range andmeasurements of brain activity can be influenced profoundly by factors suchas age, gender and level of arousal (Duaraet al., 1987; Yoshiiet al., 1988;Camargoet al., 1992; Schmidtet al., 1996). Changes in stimulation orbehavior can result in much larger effects on regional brain metabolism thanthe metabolic effects of tolerable doses of many psychoactive compounds.Thus, unless reasonable efforts are made to control for subject factors andexperimental conditions, the between-subject and within-subject variability inregional brain activity will preclude reliable detection of the subtle regionalmetabolic effects of a drug.Many compounds have been evaluated for their effects on brain metabolism(London, 1993). A surprisingly limited number of common regional metaboliceffects have been seen within drug classes. Antipsychotics, especially the older‘typical’ antipsychotics, tend to be associated with changes in striatalmetabolism consistent with the high density of D2 dopamine receptors inthose brain structures (Cohenet al., 1999). On the other hand, quite differentpatterns of metabolic effects have been seen following acute doseswith paroxetine and fluoxetine, both of which are selective serotoninNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY217217"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"reuptake inhibitors (Cooket al., 1994; Kennedyet al., 2001), and betweena2-adrenoceptor antagonists, with only very minor structural and pharmacologicaldifferences (Schmidtet al., 1997, 1999). Cocaine, methylphenidate andamphetamine each block dopamine reuptake as a principal mechanism ofaction yet result in different regional metabolic effects after acute dosing(Londonet al., 1990; Matochiket al., 1993; Ernstet al., 1997). These divergentresults suggest that even subtle differences in pharmacology and pharmaco-kinetics may result in markedly different metabolic effects in brain. Subjectvariables such as age, gender and behavioral state can profoundly influencebrain metabolism and can interact with the metabolic effects of drugs (Schmidtet al., 1997; Cohenet al., 1999). One cannot readily extrapolate from anyobserved metabolic effect of a drug to a behavioral or therapeutic outcome.Nonetheless, metabolic studies of drugs can be very useful for identifyingwhether a given dose of a drug is likely to have a central effect, has highlyregional versus diffuse effects on brain activity and discriminates from otherdoses or drugs in its effect on neuronal activity.6.3.2 MEASUREMENT OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND VOLUMEAlthough FDG-PET is the most commonly employed functional imagingmethod for evaluating functional effects of psychopharmaceuticals, a numberof other aspects of brain activity can be assessed and have been tested asindicators of drug effect. Many follow brain blood flow, because regional bloodflow is highly coupled to neuronal activity. Radioisotope-labeled blood flowmarkers that have been used in psychopharmaceutical studies include [15O]H2Oand [15O]butanol. For example, [15O]H2O PET blood flow has been used instudies of benzodiazepines evaluating global versus regional, acute versuschronic and dose response of the signal (Roy-Byrneet al., 1993a; Matthewet al., 1995).Contrast-enhanced MRI with Gd-DTPA has been applied to the evaluationof several compounds in man, some focusing on the hemodynamic effects ofthe drugs on cerebral blood volumes. Kolbtisch and others compared theanesthetic agents nitrous oxide and sevoflurane, noting them to producecompound-specific patterns of diffuse increases in cerebral blood volume(Kolbitschet al., 2001). Intravenous cocaine, on the other hand, was observedto produce dose-dependent vasoconstriction of cerebral blood vessels(Kaufmanet al., 1998).More recently BOLD-MRI has been employed in studies attempting to testthe effect of a drug on regional blood flow at ‘rest’, and during cognitive tasksor some behavioral paradigm. Breiter and others also tested the effect of acuteintravenous cocaine on the BOLD signal and observed regional increases anddecreases in signal, some of which were correlated temporally with subjectiveeffects such as euphoria (Breiteret al., 1997). At the same time, the218PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"vasoconstrictive effects observed by Kaufman and others using contrast-enhanced MRI suggests that the BOLD signal attributed to brain activitychanges could have been confounded by direct vascular effects of the drug. Themixed serotonin agonist/antagonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP)given intravenously was reported by Anderson and others to result in regionalincreases in the BOLD signal in several subcortical structures compared withpre-injection ‘rest’, and to result in enhancement and attenuation of the signalgenerated by a ‘go/no-go’ task (Andersonet al., 2002). Another notableapplication of BOLD-MRI to the assessment of psychoactive compounds wasthat by Stein and others, who measured the effect of rising doses of nicotine onthe BOLD signal in human brain. Three doses of nicotine (0.75, 1.50 and2.25 mg per 70 kg weight) were given intravenously over 1 min to humanvolunteers who smoked cigarettes. Serial MRI scans were acquired over20 min, beginning 4 min before the infusion. Voxels were identified that meteach of several change-from-baseline criteria. Dose-related increases in theBOLD signal occurred in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala and frontal cortex.This was conducted in the absence of any behavioral challenge during the MRIscans and used contrasts between doses as well as with the baseline to identify apharmacological signal. Such a study was enabled by the very short half-life ofnicotine, permitting repeated exposures within subjects as well as adaptation ofthe signal detection algorithm to the predicted pharmacokinetics of nicotine(Steinet al., 1998; Bloomet al., 1999).Although the number and range of studies continues to increase, blood flowmethods have not been as extensively used or validated for pharmacologicalstudies and differ from glucose metabolic imaging and from each other infundamental ways. The temporal resolution of PET and MRI blood flowimaging can be of the order of seconds to minutes, owing to the limitedduration of the blood flow signal. To exploit this as well as enhance signaldetection, study designs using blood flow measures often employ multiple serialassessments or ‘box-car’ designs to permit signal averaging. As noted above,blood flow signals from changes in brain activity can be confounded by thedirect vascular effects of a drug. For example, ethanol produces different effectson regional cerebral blood flow and brain glucose metabolism, probably in partdue to direct effects of ethanol on vascular tone (Volkowet al., 1988; Wanget al., 2000). As noted above, BOLD-MRI signal readouts are semi-quantitative and as such do not measure absolute change. Moreover, MRIblood flow has been suggested to be linked to synaptic activity in contrast tothe maintenance of postsynaptic ionic gradients. As such, the MRI signal maybe sensitive to neuronal excitation but relatively insensitive to neuronalinhibition (Arthurs and Boniface, 2002). The type of signal detected with theseapproaches may therefore be fundamentally different. Contrast-enhanced MRIand arterial spin-labeling both permit absolute quantitation of signal andtheoretically could be better suited to chronic drug studies requiringNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY219219"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"measurements separated by days to weeks, and there are fundamentaldifferences in the type of signal used: Gd-DTPA measures cerebral bloodvolume changes whereas arterial spin-labeling measures blood flow. Differentdrugs, experimental protocols (e.g. acute versus chronic administration) anddisease states can influence these two parameters in distinct ways, which willrequire thorough understanding of the methods to design the experiments andinterpret the data.Furthermore, the interactions that occur between behavioral activation andpharmacological effect are quite complex and the interpretation of data fromsuch studies is difficult. Positron emission tomography studies have revealed amuch greater signal generated by behavioral activations relative to the signalgenerated by psychoactive compounds at doses that do not cloud conscious-ness. For example, stimulation of the visual cortex can result in a 50% increasein glucose metabolism or blood flow whereas pharmacological stimulationof the same area with a potenta2-adrenoceptor antagonist may result in a10–12% increase in regional metabolism (Foxet al., 1987; Schmidtet al.,1999). Drug effects can be distributed throughout the central nervous system,in contrast to the more anatomically delimited activations associated withmany of the behavioral tasks and perceptual stimuli employed. Moreover,pharmacological effects follow a much different time course than behavioralactivation, so partitioning of the signal contributed by the two interventionswill be challenging. Nonetheless, brain blood flow experiments that skilfullycombine pharmacological and behavioral activation could be very informativein determining how psychoactive compounds modulate brain activity duringtasks or perception, and thus influence behavior.In addition to general measures of brain metabolism and activity, severalmethods are available for specifically evaluating the activity of thedopaminergic system. These include radiolabeled tracers evaluating presynap-tic, synaptic and postsynaptic activity. Presynaptic dopaminergic function canbe assessed with18F-labeled dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ([18F]DOPA), theamino acid derivative that serves as a substrate for dopa decarboxylase.[18F]DOPA is taken up readily by the brain and in dopaminergic neurons isdecarboxylated to form [18F]dopamine which is stored along with endogen-ously formed dopamine in intraneuronal vesicles. Owing to the slow turnoverof newly synthesized dopamine relative to the time interval of the PET study,the labeled DOPA is ‘trapped’ as labeled dopamine in dopaminergic neurons.Thus, the rate of brain uptake and accumulation of tracer in dopamine neuron-rich areas can be regarded as a valid estimate of the capacity or activity of dopadecarboxylase (Garnettet al., 1978). Primates previously given MPTP toproduce an animal model of Parkinson’s disease and patients with Parkinson’sdisease show a significantly lower uptake of labeled dopa in striatum andventral tegmentum compared with controls (Leenderset al., 1986; Doudetet al., 1989). Presynaptic function can also be assessed with radiolabeled220PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"tracers that bind to the dopamine transporter, such as11C- or123I-labeled CIT(N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane). The mostcommon application of these methods is evaluation of the dopaminergic systemin patient samples for evaluating disease severity and progression, although theyhave also been considered for assessing the chronic effects of treatment withdopamine agonists on dopaminergic neuron integrity (Brooks, 2000; Doudet,2001). Synaptic and postsynaptic function following acute or chronic drugtreatment can be assessed by dopamine-receptor-specific tracers, and some of theapplications of these have been reviewed elsewhere (Schmidt, 2001). Under-standing these methods requires an introduction to receptor occupancy theoryand the assumptions that underlie the use of receptor-specific tracers.6.3.3 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY THEORYIn addition to the measurement of brain activity, ligands have been developedlabeled with positron- or single-photon-emitting isotopes targeted to sites inthe brain such as neurotransmitter systems or receptor populations. Usingthese methods, receptor tracer studies have been used to measure receptordistributions and binding potentials as possible markers of pathophysiology ofdisease, to optimize drug treatment and to understand the clinical pharmacol-ogy of antipsychotic drugs.The concept of substrate-specific receptors in the brain evolved in part fromtheories about the mechanism of action of drugs. The foundation of this conceptwas laid as early as 1685 by Robert Boyle, who postulated that certainmedicaments were more ‘fit’ to be detained by a particular organ based on thedrug size, shape and motion. Specific ‘substances’ or receptors were proposed byLangley in 1878 to account for the opposing effects of the muscarinic agonistpilocarpine and antagonist atropine (Parascandola, 1986). Receptor theory as anexplanation of drug action continued to evolve as theories of brain organizationmoved from a holistic concept, assuming direct connectivity between neurons, toa model of the brain championed by Ramon y Cajal that recognized neurons tobe independent. Sir Charles Sherrington gave this additional support when hedemonstrated that neurons were able to communicate at synapses by chemicalrather than electrical means (Finger, 1994).A. J. Clark formulated receptor occupancy theory as a quantitative model in1933 in his doctoral dissertation. This model describes the binding of a ligand(either a drug or endogenous substrate) to a receptor and then links thisoccupancy to responses. According to mass action, the binding of a ligand to areceptor is a function of the product of their respective concentrations atequilibrium. The theory assumes that the binding is reversible, proceeds at arate dictated by the affinity of the receptor for the ligand and that there are afinite number of receptors rendering the process saturable. This model issummarized by Equations (6.1) and (6.2):NEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY221221"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"k1½L\u0001þ½R\u0001()½LR\u0001k2ð6:1Þ½LR\u0001½L\u0001þ½R\u0001¼KAð6:2Þwhere [L], [R] and [LR] are the concentrations of ligand, receptor and boundreceptor, respectively, andk1andk2are the association and dissociationconstants, respectively, andKAis the equilibrium association constant.The conservation equation for receptors defines the total number ofreceptors as the sum of bound and free receptors (Equation (6.3)). Althoughthe receptor population is in fact made up of subpopulations of receptors inhigh- and low-affinity states, this is most relevant for modeling agonistinteractions. Because most tracers are radiolabeled antagonists, this simplifiedmodel is sufficient for most tracer studies. The conservation and mass actionequations (Equations (6.3) and (6.4)) can be rearranged to calculate thenumber of bound receptors:½RT\u0001¼½R\u0001þ½LR\u0001ð6:3Þ½LR\u0001¼½L\u0001½RT\u0001KAþ½L\u0001ð6:4Þwhere [RT] is the total receptor concentration.Using this model,KAand the maximum quantity of bound receptors (Bmax)can be calculated using a Scatchard plot. This is donein vitroby using a rangeof concentrations of ligand applied to a constant number of receptors in asingle compartment, either tissue slices or homogenates. When using aradioisotope-labeled ligand as anin vivotracer, the concentration of tracer isvery low relative to other receptor substrates so that the effect of the tracer onthe physiological conditions is negligible. Nonetheless, the activity of the traceris held to be an accurate marker for the process of interest, whether it is therelative density of the receptor or the occupancy of the receptor pool by thedrug or endogenous substrate (Fekarny, 1998).Assaying brain receptors with a radioisotope-labeled ligandin vivowasdeveloped fromin vitromethods of measuring brain receptors usingautoradiography, althoughin vivomeasurements are significantly morecomplex. Rather than the single compartment used forin vitromeasurements,most full compartmental models used to describein vivoconditions use two ormore compartments in which to measure tracer concentrations. The distri-bution of tracer is first divided into intravascular (blood or plasma) andextravascular compartments. The extravascular compartment is furtherdivided into the amount of tracer bound to the receptor of interest (‘specific222PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"binding’), the free tracer and the tracer bound to other sites (‘non-specificbinding’). The latter two segments can be collapsed into a single ‘non-displaceable’ component (Huang and Phelps, 1986). This is described inEquation (6.5):jj jjk1k3½LP*\u0001 !½LND*\u0001 !½LS*\u0001k2k4jj jjBBBð6:5Þwhere BBB is the blood–brain barrier, [LP*], [LND*] and [LS*] are theconcentrations of tracer in plasma and in non-displaceable and specificallybound domains, respectively,k1andk2are the transport rate constants in andout across the blood–brain barrier, respectively, andk3and k4are the on andoff rate constants, respectively.In imaging brain receptors, the movement of tracer from the intravascular tothe extravascular compartment is a function of the blood–brain barrierpenetrability of the carrier. Even for lipophilic compounds that enter the brainreadily via passive diffusion, this occurs at rates much slower than the bindingof the tracer to the receptor. This requires the measurement and correction ofimage data for the intravascular or ‘blood flow’ signal. Moreover, tracers aresimply labeled drugs or analogs of endogenous substrates, rendering themsubject to the vicissitudes of distribution and metabolism. This can require themeasurement of lipophilic metabolites that may retain the isotope label inorder to correct the image data.In vitromethods determine receptor kinetics by comparing binding across arange of ligand concentrations. The limits for radiation exposure from theradioisotope and the logistics required for performing these imaging studiesgenerally do not permit the use of a range of tracer or cold-challenge drugconcentrations within subjects for humanin vivostudies. In theory,KAandBmaxcould be calculated by estimating the high specific-activity tracerconcentrations in the extravascular compartment at several time points orusing low specific-activity tracer infusions over an extended period of time.However, these methods are not sufficiently accurate or practicable to use in asingle PET experiment, soBmaxandKAcannot be determined properly. As acompromise, the ratioBmax/KAis frequently calculated. This ratio correspondsto the ratio ofk3/k4and is referred to as the binding potential (Mintunet al.,1984). The binding potential of a tracer can be obtained using a full or reducedcompartmental model and fitting the rates of distribution of the tracer in thedifferent compartments (from the time–activity curves) and calculatingk3andk4. For selected tracers it can be approximated using a reference tissue method.NEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY223223"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Following this method, the tracer activity in a region with high concentrationsof a receptor (e.g. basal ganglia for D2 receptors) is essentially corrected fornon-specific binding by using the time–activity curve measured in a region withlow or negligible concentrations of the receptor (such as cerebellum for D2receptors) (Lammertsma and Hume, 1996). A commonly used ‘correction’involves simply calculating the ratio of integrated activity in the region ofinterest relative to the reference region.Receptor-specific tracers have been used to estimate the dose/occupancyrelationships for a number of psychopharmaceuticals, including dopamine D2receptor antagonists (Nyberget al., 1996), serotonin 5-HT2a and 5-HT1areceptor antagonists (Gefvertet al., 1998; Rabineret al., 2000), benzo-diazepines (Shinotohet al., 1989), neurokinin NK1 receptor antagonists(Bergstromet al., 2000), drugs acting at muscarinic cholinergic receptors(Raedleret al., 1999), inhibitors of dopamine and serotonin transporters(Meyeret al., 2001; Volkowet al., 2002) and opiate receptor agonists (Sadzotetal., 1990). These studies are conducted after single-dose challenges in dose-ranging studies or after chronic treatment. An example of such a study isdepicted in Plate 6.2. Chronic treatment with the selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, at a dose predicted to be in the therapeutic range,results in the occupancy and presumed blockade of approximately 80% of theavailable serotonin transporters in brain.In addition to estimating occupancy at steady state, by conducting serialstudies after treatment is stopped one can estimate the duration of occupancy(Grunderet al., 1997). One may thus calculate the central clearance of activedrug in the brain, which often will be much slower than peripheral clearancedue to the lipophilic nature of many psychopharmaceuticals. These types ofstudies can be extraordinarily informative for understanding the relationshipbetween drug dose and efficacy and safety. At the same time, the inventory oftracers available for such studies is quite limited. Whereas a number of tracersare available for the dopaminergic system, no tracer is currently available forimaging many of the other systems in brain. As drug development begins toexplore the potential of new targets such as the excitatory amino acids andpeptide receptors, there will be a critical need for the parallel development oftracers directed at these targets.6.3.4 DRUG DISPOSITIONDisposition of a drug in the brain can be assessed by estimating thedistribution of the drug labeled with a radioisotope (Fardeet al., 1996) or, inselected cases, with MRS. Distribution using radiolabeling is the mostcommonly used approach and generally involves substitution of11C for a12C atom in the molecule, the site being determined by the ease in theradiolabeling (such as a methyl group) and the likelihood of generating224PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"significant amounts of brain-penetrant metabolites bearing the label during thetime course of the PET study. The principle is the same as drug distributionstudies in peripheral compartments using14C-labeled drug except that themeasurement is in the brain with all the technical requirements and constraintsof PET. A very small amount of the radiolabeled drug is given intravenouslyand PET images of the brain are acquired almost immediately after. The dataare corrected for the amount of tracer circulating in the bloodstream, whichalso contributes to the brain signal, and then the amount and distribution ofthe tracer in brain tissue can be estimated. The objective of these studies isoften to characterize how easily and rapidly a drug enters the brain – a criticalissue in developing new psychopharmaceuticals – and this does not depend onwhether the binding of the drug is specific or not. Indeed, most psychoactivedrugs that are developed for clinical use are very lipophilic and distributeprincipally into brain lipid such as white matter. Although the concentration oftracer is nanomolar with this technique, the plasma to brain ratio can be usedto predict the relative concentrations of ‘cold’ drug given at pharmacologicaldoses. The short half-life of11C allows estimation of brain penetration for alittle over an hour and would not predict poorly but still penetrant compounds.6.3.5 ASSESSING DRUG DISPOSITION WITH MRSAs noted above, NMR or MRS can be used to detect any atom with an ‘odd’atomic weight and therefore can be used to measure several other atoms inbrain tissue besides protons. Clinical imaging with MRI relies on protons forthe signal because of their great abundance (especially associated with water)and diffuse distribution. Other atoms of interest in psychopharmaceuticalstudies have included19F and7Li, provided that they are ‘mobile’ (visible toMRS) and present at micromolar concentrations. Such concentrations areachieved during chronic treatment with lithium salts and many fluorinatedpsychotropic compounds such as fluoxetine and fluphenazine. The advantageof this technique is that the signal does not require the introduction of aradioisotope, it estimates concentrations under chronic (steady state) condi-tions and serial scans can be conducted to look at the clearance of thesecompounds between doses or after dosing has stopped (Henryet al., 2000;Mooreet al., 2002). Moreover, because MRS can detect the clinical form of thedrug, uses clinical doses and conducts the study at steady state, one canestimate the absolute concentration of the drug in the brain. The caveat to thisstatement is that lipophilic metabolites that are brain penetrant and retain thefluorine atom will also be measured by MRS. Drug disposition studies usingMRS are limited to drugs with these atoms, and the concentrations in the brainof even highly lipophilic compounds are such that the resolution is limited.However, MRS can provide pharmacokinetic information in the brain,where these compounds have their therapeutic effect. Similar to studies withNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGYNEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY225225"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"radiotracers, MRS studies have shown that the clearance from the brain isgenerally much slower than the clearance from the bloodstream. Thisknowledge is critical for determining the appropriate dose and dosing intervalfor these compounds.6.4 FUTURE DEVELOPMENTSThe full potential of any of the methods described has not been realized andmuch remains to understand and validate more fully the information yieldedby these techniques. As an accepted measure of hexokinase activity, FDG-PETprovides a model for the development of other approaches to evaluating brainphysiology. Other enzyme systems that have been explored include the labelingof monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B with ‘suicide’ inhibitors (clorgylineand deprenyl, respectively), revealing important information on the time courseof the effect of MAO inhibitors and the unexpected finding of significantdownregulation of MAOs in cigarette smokers (Fowleret al., 1996, 1998).11C-labeled rolipram is currently being investigated as a potential measure ofchange in phosphodiesterase enzyme type 4, an important link in the second-messenger cascade initiated by many antidepressants (Lourencoet al., 2001).Other enzyme systems also might be explored with suitable radiolabeledsubstrates. Most studies of brain activity have been conducted after singledoses, yielding valuable information about acute pharmacology, but chroniceffects are generally more relevant to the therapeutic and safety characteristicsof drugs. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has only begun to be explored as ameans of evaluating drug effects in the brain. Beyond the studies of7Li and19F, MRS can be used to explore the effect of drugs on endogenous moleculescarrying31P, such as the various forms of phosphorylated adenosine used asenergy in the cell, and proton-rich biomolecules (other than water) that areinvolved in cellular metabolism and neuronal signaling. For example,1H-MRSwas successfully applied to estimating the exposure response relationshipbetween vigabatrin and brain GABA concentrations (Petroffet al., 1996).A rich library of tracers exists for the dopamine system and perhaps also theserotonin system; however, little or nothing currently exists for the assessmentof many other neurotransmitter systems in the brain, some of whose receptorshave been identified only recently. Pharmaceutical and biotechnologyindustries are major sources not only of new compounds that target thesesites as candidate therapeutics but also of compounds that may serve asradiotracers to evaluate these sites and the effects of disease and treatment.The incentive and raw materials for continued development of functionalimaging of the human brain will depend on the establishment of sustainedcollaborations between academic and government research centers and thepharmaceutical industry.226PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"7Psychotropic Drugs and CognitiveFunction7.1 INTRODUCTIONHuman behavior traditionally has been conceptualized in terms of threefunctional areas:cognition, designating the information-handling aspect ofbehavior;emotionality, comprising feelings and emotions; andexecutivefunctions, which are related to the way behavior is expressed. As formulatedby Deutsch Lezak (1995, p. 20), components of each of these three sets offunctions are as integral to every bit of behavior as are the length and breadthand height to the shape of an object, i.e. none of them takes priority over theothers. Referring to the computer operations of input, storage, processing andoutput, Deutsch Lezak (1995, p. 22) distinguishes the following cognitivefunctions:.Receptive functions: the ability to select, acquire, classify and integrateinformation..Memory and learning: information storage and retrieval..Thinking: the mental organization and reorganization of information..Expressive functions: the means through which information is commu-nicated or acted upon.This chapter deals with the question of how psychotropic drugs act uponcognitive functions in man. Some of the pertinent information, i.e. how singledoses of these pharmaceuticals affect cognitive performance in healthyvolunteers under experimental conditions, has been reviewed and discussedin Chapter 3. However, when dealing with drug effects in patients sufferingfrom schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, etc. one must expect a muchPsychopharmacology, Fourth Edition. By R.

In view of the variety of conditions treatedwith these compounds, the different clinical significance of cognitive symptomswithin the diseases treated, the differences in drug use (prophylactic, short-termsymptomatic, long-term symptomatic, maintenance) and other factors, onemay anticipate a rather heterogeneous picture to emerge as far as the effects oncognitive performance are concerned.7.2 ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS7.2.1 COGNITIVE CHANGES IN SCHIZOPHRENIASchizophrenia designates a group of mental disorders rather than a uniformdisease. Eugen Bleuler (1911), who coined the term schizophrenia, disputed thethen current Kraepelinian concept of ‘dementia praecox’ because he hadrecognized that the disorders in question could have very different courses andoutcomes. Specifically, not all patients with schizophrenic psychoses ended upin dementia praecox, i.e. with a premature loss of their mind. Carpenter andBuchanan (1994) suggested that the clinical manifestations of schizophreniacould be grouped into three relatively separate core domains of psychopathol-ogy (the ‘three-compartment model’ of schizophrenia):(1) Psychotic symptoms: hallucinations, delusions.(2) Cognitive impairment: positive formal thought disorder such as:tangentiality, loss of goals, incoherence, looseness of associations,neologisms.(3) Negative symptoms: restricted affect, diminished emotional range, povertyof speech, curbing of interests, diminished sense of purpose, diminishedsocial drive.According to this model, a discussion of potential therapeutic drug effects oncognitive function in schizophrenia should focus upon the correction ofabnormalities in thought and speech. Other authors, e.g. Schultz andAndreasen (1999), appear to subsume a much wider range of schizophrenicsymptoms under the umbrella of cognitive abnormalities: ‘‘Several cognitiveand emotional functions are impaired, such as perception (hallucinations),228PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"inferential thinking (delusions), motivation (avolition) and thought and speech(alogia) . . . Many negative symptoms are cognitive, such as alogia, avolition,and attentional impairment . . .’’. This broader interpretation of cognitivedisturbances implies that all patients with schizophrenia suffer from some kindof cognitive impairment and that a discussion of positive drug effects oncognitive functions would comprise most of the symptomatic spectrum of thedisorder.Depending on the criteria applied and the specific neuropsychological testsused there is great variation in the reported frequency of cognitive impairmentin schizophrenic patients. Deutsch Lezak (1995, p. 324) cautioned that ‘themajority of persons diagnosed as schizophrenics have neither the neurologicalstigmata nor significant neuropsychological deficits’. Meltzer and Fatemi(1998) estimated that about 40% of patients with schizophrenia have majordeficits in measures of attention, executive function, verbal learning andmemory, spatial and verbal working memory, semantic memory andpsychomotor performance. Palmeret al.(1997) reported that only about aquarter of schizophrenic patients in their study sample could be considered‘neuropsychologically normal’. Bilderet al.(2000) provided mean values,standard deviations, etc. of psychomotor performance scores but no estimationof the percentage of schizophrenic patients showing significant cognitivedeficit.Much of the current knowledge about cognitive impairment in schizophreniawas summarized by O’Carroll (2000) as follows:(1) Significant cognitive deficit affects up to 75% of patients withschizophrenia (this estimation may be very much on the high side; seeRund and Borg, 1999).(2) A wide range of cognitive functions are affected, particularly memory,attention, motor skills, executive function and intelligence. In contrast,implicit learning appears to be unaffected (Danionet al., 2001).(3) The cognitive impairment often predates the illness onset. It is an intrinsicpart of the illness and is also observed in young, drug-naı ̈ve patients.According to a number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies (e.g.Heatonet al., 2001; Normanet al., 2001), cognitive deficits do not showsignificant progression in the majority of schizophrenic patients.(4) Efforts to explain core clinical features of schizophrenia as a consequenceof specific neuropsychological abnormalities have been disappointing.(5) Cognitive impairment is related to social and functional outcome.Eganet al.(2001) reported that mentally healthy siblings of schizophrenicpatients had weaker performance than unrelated healthy controls on a numberof tests on which the schizophrenic patients showed significant deficit(Wisconsin Card Sorting, Trail Making B and some verbal tests). Impairmenton one test only weakly predicted impairment on other tests, suggesting thatPSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION229"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"there are specific familial and possibly heritable cognitive deficiencies that mayact as individual risk factors. According to Eganet al.these ‘cognitivephenotypes’ may identify distinct, familial traits associated with schizophrenia.If applied to therapeutic trials, this concept could provide more individualizedanalyses of therapeutic outcomes: in addition to group means, standarddeviations, etc. one would then consider individual performance deficits atbaseline as well as their changes following treatment, and provide separateanalyses with subgroups of patients characterized by similar deficits at baseline.7.2.2 EFFECTS OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGSAccording to an early overview by Davis and Casper (1978), the cognitiveperformance of schizophrenic patients usually improves during the course oftreatment with antipsychotic drugs. Textbook authors such as Baldessarini(1985) Hinterhuber and Haring (1992) and Janicaket al.(1993) did notspecifically address the effects of antipsychotic drugs on cognitive functions inschizophrenic patients. Delirious states were mentioned as an occasional sideeffect of antipsychotic drugs with pronounced anticholinergic action such asthioridazine and chlorpromazine; the incidence of such events is highest inelderly patients. Cassenset al.(1990) noted that the available literaturecontained no conclusive evidence of an adverse effect of antipsychotics on thelearning and memory functions of patients. Rund and Borg (1999) stated that‘‘there is not yet sufficient empirical evidence for dramatic effects ofconventional neuroleptics with regard to either improvement or impairment[of cognitive function]’’.Major interest in the beneficial effects of antipsychotic drugs on cognitivefunction in schizophrenic patients emerged after 1990, and most of the recentreports therefore focus on the newer, atypical drugs rather than on traditionalantipsychotics. A critical review of studies published up to 2001 (Weisset al.,2002) lists 17 papers dealing with clozapine (8 studies), risperidone (7 studies),olanzapine (3 studies) or quetiapine (4 studies). Some of the papers containeddata from exploratory open trials whereas others dealt with findings fromcomparative studies with more than one antipsychotic drug. The resultsreported by Weisset al.are summarized in Table 7.1; however the authorsmade it clear that the underlying studies were heterogeneous with regard tosize, design, duration and other relevant factors. As a consequence, they‘‘provide conflicting results and have a variety of methodological limitations. Itappears that the findings from many exploratory studies can now be distilledinto more focused, hypothesis-driven study design’’. Harvey and Keefe (2001)shared the critical attitude of Weisset al.and noted that ‘‘the methodology forassessing the treatment of cognitive deficits [in schizophrenia] is still beingdeveloped’’.230PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"More recently, two methodologically advanced studies have been published:a comparison between four antipsychotic drugs in a trial of 14 weeks duration(Bilderet al., 2002, see Box 7.1); and a study of 2 years duration comparing anatypical with an older ‘typical’ antipsychotic drug (Greenet al., 2002).Perhaps the most striking finding in the study by Bilderet al.is the superiorperformance of risperidone on learning and memory and the somewhatdisappointing effect of clozapine on cognitive functioning in these chronic,therapy-resistant patients. Both observations are in contrast to clinicalobservations made in the same study and reported by Volavkaet al.(2002):risperidone was found to be less clinically effective than clozapine andolanzapine, and clozapine proved superior to the other treatments with regardto negative symptoms. These discrepant observations would support state-ments made by, for example, O’Carroll (2000) and Potkinet al.(2001), thatclinical symptoms and cognitive performance of schizophrenic patients mayshow almost independent courses. On the other hand, one should also keep inmind that the findings originate from a relatively short-term study and that it isperhaps unrealistic to expect clear-cut and reliable cognitive improvement inpatients who had been ill for many years before being included in this study.The study by Greenet al.(2002) included 62 patients, almost exclusivelymales, mean age 43 years, mean age of onset of the disease about 25 years, witha diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In contrast to thepatients studied by Bilderet al.(2002), these individuals were not treatment-resistant and they were stabilized on antipsychotic drugs for at least 2 monthsbefore entering the trial. The doses of medication used in this maintenance trialwere much lower than those reported by Bilderet al.: the mean daily dose ofhaloperidol was 5 mg or slightly less and the mean daily dose of risperidonewas about 6 mg. The planned study duration was 2 years, with about half of thepatients completing the trial; a neurocognitive battery providing 13 keyvariables was administered at baseline and then at weeks 4, 24, 48, 72 and 104.PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION231Table 7.1Improved cognitive performance after atypical antipsychoticsaClozapineRisperidone Olanzapine QuetiapineReaction timeYesNon.a.n.a.Visuomotor trackingn.a.YesYesYesVerbal fluencyYesn.a.YesYesAttentionYesYesYesYesExecutive function(Yes)YesYesYesVerbal learning and memory Mixed results YesYesYesImmediate recalln.a.Yesn.a.YesVisual learning and memory No/n.a.Mixed results Yesn.a.aSummary of findings reported by Weisset al.(2002); see text concerning the quality of theunderlying studies; n.a.¼no data available."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Box 7.1 A Controlled Comparison between Four AntipsychoticDrugsIn a cooperative study of four US state psychiatric hospitals, Bilderet al.(2002) compared three atypical antipsychotic drugs (clozapine,olanzapine, risperidone) with haloperidol in a double-blind, parallel-group trial. Patients (n¼101) had a diagnosis of treatment-resistantschizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV;treatment resistance was defined as ‘‘persistent positive symptoms(hallucinations, delusions, or marked thought disorder) after at least6 contiguous weeks of treatment, presently or documented in thepast, with one or more typical antipsychotics at doses5600 mg/daychlorpromazine’’, plus ‘‘a poor level of functioning over the past 2years, defined by the lack of competitive employment or enrollmentin an academic or vocational program . . .’’ Patients also had to havea baseline total score of at least 60 on the PANSS (Positive andNegative Syndrome Scale; Kayet al., 1987). Mean age in the fourgroups was comparable (about 40 years), as was mean duration ofillness (about 20 years) and the mean number of previoushospitalizations; more than 80% of the patients were male, morethan 50% were black and less than 30% were white.The four drugs were administered by psychiatrists blinded totreatment group assignment of patients. The 14-week studyconsisted of an 8-week dose escalation and fixed dose and a 6-week variable-dose period. The mean dose levels (mg/day) of thefour compounds after the first 8 weeks were 452 for clozapine, 20.2for olanzapine, 8.3 for risperidone and 19.6 for haloperidol.Patients on haloperidol received prophylactic anticholinergicmedication to prevent extrapyramidal symptoms, and a few otherdrugs were permitted to treat agitation and insomnia.The neurocognitive test battery consisted of 10 tests that provided16 individual measures. By using principal component factoranalysis of baseline values, a global score and four domain scoreswere calculated; these were termed ‘declarative verbal learning andmemory’, ‘processing speed and attention’, ‘simple motor function-ing’ and ‘general executive and perceptual organization’.The main findings with regard to drug effects on cognitiveperformance were as follows:.Patients treated with olanzapine improved in global score, ingeneral executive and perceptual organization and in processingspeed and attention.232PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":".Patients treated with risperidone improved in global score..Patients treated with clozapine improved in simple motorfunctioning.With regard to the global score, and taking into account thenumber of patients with ‘clinically significant’ neurocognitiveimprovement, patients on olanzapine and risperidone fared betterthan those on haloperidol; patients on clozapine were betweenthose on risperidone and haloperidol. The average effect sizes werejudged as being in the small to medium range. There were severalsignificant correlations between the clinical (PANSS) variables,notably the negative symptom subscale scores, and the neuro-cognitive changes. On the other hand, when partialed out, thePANSS scores had little influence on the main neurocognitiveeffects, indicating that treatment-related changes of cognitivefunction and psychiatric symptoms proceeded with considerableindependence.In contrast to earlier studies clozapine had significant beneficialimpact on motor performance but not on memory function.According to the authors, this could be due to the anticholinergiceffect of clozapine. Risperidone, a drug without anticholinergicproperties, showed the strongest effect on declarative verballearning and memory, whereas olanzapine, which also has stronganticholinergic effects, was not better than clozapine and haloper-idol with regard to its effect on memory.The neurocognitive findings were summarized in a general composite score andseparately in three cluster scores, one standing for perceptual discrimination,one for memory and fluency, and the third one for executive functioning.Improvement from baseline after 2 years was observed in both treatmentgroups for the general composite score and for the memory and fluency cluster,but there were no significant differences between the patients treated withrisperidone and haloperidol. The time course of cognitive improvement wasdifferent in the two groups: patients on risperidone showed a gradual andcontinuous increase in performance; patients on haloperidol displayed initialimprovement and subsequent stabilization at the higher level. Interestingly,patients on haloperidol had more tremor and akathisia, but these adverseevents did not appear to have a relevant impact upon cognitive performance.The authors speculated ‘‘that conventional [antipsychotic] medications mayhave neurocognitive benefits at lower doses that are neutralized or reversed athigher doses’’.PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION233"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"7.2.3 COMMENTSA preliminary conclusion that one can draw from the studies quoted in thissection is that antipsychotic drugs often have modest positive effects on thecognitive functions of schizophrenic patients. As Green (2002) has pointed out,the second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics may convey advantages over theconventional ones if used at standard doses, but even with these more recentdrugs neurocognitive performance is often not brought up to that of normalcontrols. Many questions are still unanswered, however (see Harvey and Keefe,2001): the extent, specificity and practical significance of cognitive deficits indifferent subtypes of schizophrenia (Brazoet al., 2002), their temporal relation-ship to the clinical symptomatology and its changes on drug treatment and, atleast in the case of acutely psychotic patients, the reliability and validity ofpsychometric measurements performed on individuals suffering from delusions,hallucinations, thought disorder and associated affective symptoms.7.3 ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS7.3.1 COGNITIVE CHANGES IN DEPRESSIONMood disorders are frequently associated with cognitive impairment. Inyounger depressives attention and concentration are primarily affected, andresponses in speed-related tasks may be abnormally slowed. Complaints aboutserious cognitive dysfunction, which are particularly frequent in older patientswith depression, cannot always be fully substantiated by means of objectivetests (O’Haraet al., 1986). Nevertheless, significant deficits in the followingareas have been found:.Episodic memory and learning, involving both explicit verbal and visualmemory performance; in contrast, recognition and implicit memory tasksappear to be spared..Executive tasks, e.g. tests of verbal fluency and attentional set-shifting (suchas card sorting tasks), are significantly impaired in patients with more severedepression and in elderly depressed patients.The severity of the disorder appears to contribute to the neuropsychologicaldeficits; this relationship is most clearly recognized in the so-called melancholicsubtype of depression. Another relevant factor is age: cognitive deficits aregenerally more severe and more widespread in old than in younger depressedpatients (Butterset al., 2000).There have been different approaches to explain the cognitive deficits indepression. Weingartner and Silbermann (1982), noting that depressed patientshad more difficulty with ‘effortful’ than with ‘automatic’ memory tasks (e.g.verbal recall vs. recognition), hypothesized that an ‘altered motivation state’234PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"characteristic of depression was responsible for the cognitive deficienciesobserved. Austinet al.(2001) consider this view (‘‘if patients feel unwell theywill not try so hard’’) somewhat dated; in their view the fact that there may bepersistent cognitive impairment even upon recovery in mood disorders,particularly in older subjects, provides ‘‘important evidence that enduringbrain abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of depressive disorder’’.Studies using neuroimaging techniques suggest that structural, mainlysubcortical abnormalities in aged depressed patients frequently underlie theobserved cognitive deficits. However, in a discussion of the possible neurallocalization of cognitive dysfunction in aged depressive patients, Austinet al.(2001) caution against premature allocation of abnormal neuropsychologicaltest results to specific neuroanatomical defects: most neuropsychological tasksrelate to more than one cognitive domain, making diagnoses based on testperformance and aiming at specific structural deficits rather doubtful.7.3.2 EFFECTS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGSAntidepressants differ from one another in at least two areas of pharmaco-logical activity that are relevant to cognitive function: their degree of sedativeaction (which may be due to different mechanisms) and their centralanticholinergic effects. Sedative drug action might be evident as impairment ofcognitive performance in general, whereas central anticholinergic effects mightmanifest themselves more specifically as impairments of learning and memory(see Section 7.5). Experimental study results gathered in healthy volunteers andsummarized in Table 3.6 (Chapter 3) support the first assumption but notnecessarily the second one: impairment on a variety of cognitive performanceparameters is seen after sedative antidepressants, yet there is no strong evidenceof a specific action of anticholinergic agents, such as amitriptyline andimipramine, on measures of learning and memory. Previous reviewers (Deptulaand Pomara, 1990; Thompson, 1991; Curran, 1992a) drew similar conclusionsand stressed the close association between general sedative drug effects andimpairment of cognitive performance seen in healthy subjects. It should be noted,however, that two studies in non-depressed volunteers, published by the samegroup of investigators (Curranet al., 1988; Sakulsriponget al., 1991) did suggesta memory-impairing action of the antidepressant amitriptyline going beyondwhat could be expected on the basis of its sedative effects alone.Although states of confusion and delirium are well known side effects ofsome older antidepressants, textbooks of psychopharmacology before 1990hardly mentioned any specific actions of these drugs upon cognitive functionin patients. Hollister (1978) reported an incidence of confusional states in10–15% of all patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants, rising to 35% andmore in patients aged over 40 years. Schatzberget al.(1978) described aphenomenon occasionally noted in individuals over 40 years old and receivingPSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION235"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"antidepressants, to which they gave the termspeech blockage: patients haddifficulty in finding the next logically following thought in a discussion or inexpressing an idea in words. The appropriate words would usually occur tothem after a pause of a few seconds, but the unexpected interruptions inthought and speech processes often caused anxiety and worry. An experimentalstudy (Branconnieret al., 1987) comparing the sedative antidepressantmaprotiline with the sedative and anticholinergic drug amitriptyline in patientswith major depressive disorders confirmed the occurrence of speech blockageafter amitriptyline in patients over 55–60 years but not in younger agegroups.Because antidepressants help to resolve depressive episodes and also mayhave sedative and anticholinergic actions, the question of practical importancearises as to whether the use of specific antidepressant compounds is associatedwith improvement in depressive cognitive dysfunction or with additionaldeterioration. An early, often quoted study by Sternberg and Jarvik (1976, seeBox 7.2) suggested that amitriptyline and imipramine led to clinicalimprovement in the majority of depressive patients that, despite the stronganticholinergic effects of both compounds used, was accompanied 4 weeks laterby an improvement in memory function. This somewhat reassuring finding hasbeen supplemented and partially confirmed by results obtained in studies withother antidepressant drugs (see review by Thompson, 1991). Furthermore, alongitudinal investigation in a population-based sample of 1488 adults(Podewils and Lyketsos, 2002) failed to support the concept that the use oftricyclic antidepressants is related to measurable long-term (median 11.5 years)cognitive deficits; it should be mentioned, however, that the assessment scaleused in this observational study, the MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination;Folsteinet al., 1975), provides only a crude estimate of cognitive function, andthat the amount and duration of antidepressant drug use in the populationstudied were not specified.Although deleterious effects of antidepressants with anticholinergic actionupon cognitive functions have not really been proven in controlled clinicaltrials, there are other medical reasons to restrict the use of these drugs in elderlyand old patients (Chapter 1). Consequently, strong educational efforts aremade in some countries to replace, at least in older depressed patients, drugssuch as amitriptyline, clomipramine, doxepin and imipramine with compoundshaving similar efficacy but less or no anticholinergic action (van Eijket al.,2001). Preferred antidepressants with minor or no anticholinergic effectsaccording to these authors comprise a number of tricyclic compounds (e.g.desipramine, nortriptyline, trimipramine), the selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs), the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and severalother compounds such as trazodone, venlafaxine and mirtazapine.Proven or alleged lack of negative effects upon cognitive function, especiallymemory performance, is occasionally used as an argument to support the use236PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Box 7.2 Anticholinergic antidepressants: Improvementor Deterioration of Memory?Sternberg and Jarvik (1976) studied 26 patients with endogenousdepression and 26 healthy subjects matched for age, gender andeducation. The patients were newly hospitalized and had not yetreceived any antidepressants at the time of the first examination.Three tests of learning and memory were performed by the patientsand subjects: learning of 15 weakly associated pairs of words;recognition of 15 previously shown drawings of familiar objectsamong 30 drawings; and association of three portraits with threefictitious descriptions of people.The depressed patients were found to be inferior to the healthysubjects in pair-associate learning and in linking portraits withdescriptions of people. Picture recognition did not differ signifi-cantly because both groups had near-maximum performance.When the tests were repeated 3 h later, both groups of subjectsperformed worse than before and the differences between thepatients and healthy controls were significantly reduced. This wasinterpreted by the authors as an indication that immediate memorybut not the ability to retain learned material was affected in thedepressed patients. The patients then were treated with eitherimipramine or amitriptyline at doses of 150–300 mg/day. Fourweeks later, the therapeutic results were evaluated and patientswere divided into four groups:.Group A: fully remitted (n¼4)..Group B: considerable improvement (n¼8)..Group C: moderate improvement (n¼8)..Group D: no noticeable improvement (n¼6).At this time the tests of learning and memory were repeated withgroups A, B and C, i.e. with 20 patients showing at least moderateclinical improvement, as well as with some of the healthyvolunteers to estimate the effect of training. Compared withtheir performance at baseline, the 20 patients showed highlysignificant improvement in the two recall tasks immediately afterpresentation but not 3 h later (i.e. the time point when theirperformance had not differed much from that of the referencegroup at baseline).

It is of interest, therefore, to consider briefly the published evidencerelevant to this issue:.A critical review by Olveret al.(2001) on so-called ‘‘third-generationantidepressants’’ (venlafaxine, reboxetine, nefazodone, mirtazapine) cov-ered 30 controlled therapeutic trials and a number of relapse preventionstudies. Questions addressed were overall efficacy, speed of onset and safetybut, according to this review, none of the third-generation antidepressantswas specifically tested with respect to its potential effects on cognitivefunction in depressed patients..A meta-analysis of 32 controlled studies comparing venlafaxine with severalSSRIs and other antidepressants (Smithet al., 2002) demonstrated somemodest efficacy advantage for venlafaxine. Tolerability was consideredcomparable to that of the reference compounds but no information isprovided on the effects of venlafaxine on cognitive function in depressedpatients..A number of SSRIs and SNRIs were tested for their effects on cognitivefunction in repeated-dose studies in healthy, non-depressed volunteers.Studies with SSRIs before 1999 have been reviewed by Lane and O’Hanlon(1999) and some more recent reports deal with nefazodone, paroxetine andsertraline (Furlanet al., 2001; Schmittet al., 2001; van Laaret al., 2002).However, considering the populations studied in these trials (non-depressedsubjects), the duration of drug administration (1–2 weeks) and the mostlylow drug doses used, the relevance of these studies for a clinical situationmay be questioned.With regard to its effects on cognitive performance in the target population, theSSRI sertraline appears to be the most thoroughly studied newer antidepres-sant. Lane and O’Hanlon (1999) listed three controlled clinical studies withfluoxetine and three with sertraline; however, all three trials with fluoxetine andone of the trials with sertraline were not sufficiently powered to demonstratereliable differences between treatments. One of the two adequately poweredstudies, a comparison between nortriptyline and sertraline in elderly depressedpatients (Bondareffet al., 2000; see Box 7.3), supports the notion thatantidepressants with anticholinergic action (such as nortriptyline) are similarly238PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"effective as SSRIs against depressions of old age but may impair cognitivefunction, particularly memory performance. The other study was a comparisonlasting 12 weeks between two SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, in 236outpatients 60 years of age or older who met the DSM-III-R criteria (APA,1987) for major depressive disorder (Newhouseet al., 2000). In this trial thetwo compounds produced similar improvement on the Hamilton Rating Scalefor Depression scores, resulting in almost identical responder rates; patientstreated with sertraline were found to be transiently superior to those onfluoxetine on a memory test (shopping list) and significantly better in the digitsymbol substitution task (DSST) after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Togetherwith similar observations made in several smaller comparative studies (e.g.Levkovitzet al., 2002), these results suggest that antidepressants withoutanticholinergic effects, such as SSRIs and SNRIs, do not negatively affectcognitive performance and ought to be given preference in the treatment ofelderly depressed patients.Box 7.3 Effects of Two Antidepressants on Cognitive Function inOlder Depressed PatientsIn a double-blind, parallel-group study, Bondareffet al.(2000)compared the SSRI sertraline and the tricyclic compoundnortriptyline with regard to their efficacy and safety in a group of210 outpatients 60 years and older. The patients met the DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive episode and had a minimum scoreof 18 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Their mean agewas about 68 years, most patients were white and about 60% werefemale; the severity of depression was rated as ‘moderate’ in morethan 70% and as ‘severe’ in more than 20% of the cases. The dailydoses of sertraline were between 50 and 150 mg, and those ofnortriptyline were 25–100 mg; the treatment lasted 12 weeks. Inaddition to clinical rating scales and self-assessment instruments,patients took the following tests of cognitive performance:.The DSST from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale..A shopping list task, presented as a selective remindingprocedure..The MMSE (Folsteinet al., 1975).About 70% of the patients in both treatment groups completed thetrial, with similar therapeutic efficacy (Hamilton Rating Scale forDepression) shown for both compounds. The pattern of adverseevents was different, with more patients reporting diarrhea, nauseaand insomnia on sertraline, and more patients on nortriptylinePSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION239"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"reporting dry mouth and constipation. Significant differences infavor of sertraline were found in all three cognitive measures used:.The MMSE showed some improvement on sertraline and someminor decline on nortriptyline; the difference between treatmentswas statistically significant (P50.01)..Performance on the DSST was improved on both drugs, butmore so on sertraline (P¼0.002)..The number of items recalled on the shopping list task increasedon sertraline and decreased on nortriptyline (P50.001).These differential findings would support the concept thatnortriptyline (which has modest anticholinergic action) may havenegative effects on cognitive functioning, especially memoryperformance, in elderly depressed patients, whereas sertraline(which is devoid of anticholinergic effects) has no or perhapsslightly favorable effects on cognitive function in these patients.According to the authors, the observations ‘‘may reflect theselective vulnerability of older adults to the central anticholinergicactivity of nortriptyline’’.7.3.3 EFFECTS OF LITHIUM AND OTHER MOOD STABILIZERSAccording to Lenox and Manji (1998) the ‘‘cognitive effects of lithium appearto be some of the most problematic for patients, yet they remain the leaststudied’’. A number of early observational studies were concerned with thequestion of whether lithium, which is normally administered for months oryears, leads to detectable cognitive disturbance, particularly memory impair-ment. A starting point for these studies was the observation that many patientstreated with lithium complained of being mentally slower, less attentive andalso more forgetful than they used to be before they were put on lithium.In healthy subjects lithium leads to slight psychomotor slowing, which isusually accompanied by a subjective feeling of impaired performance andlearning capacity (Juddet al., 1987) and can last for several weeks. Greil andVan Calker (1983) reviewed the then available clinical literature and concludedthat the actions of lithium on the cognitive functions, including memory, ofpatients on continuous treatment are slight. This view was supported bysubsequent studies by Engelsmannet al.(1988) and Joffeet al.(1988).However, most of the available evidence stems from observational studies thatdo not allow definitive conclusions: baseline measurements of cognitiveperformance obtained before starting lithium treatment were presented in240PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"only a few studies; in addition, practically all of these investigations lack acontrol group not treated with lithium, with the consequence that a definitiveevaluation of the observed effects is not possible.Observations of patients treated with lithium for 10 years or more haveprovided the somewhat comforting finding that, even after long-termtreatment, these individuals did not show memory disorders going beyondthe expected age-related changes (Engelsmannet al., 1988).Most antiepileptic drugs with approved or out-of-label use in affectivedisorders have been more or less systematically tested with regard to theireffects on cognitive performance. The results listed below are from studies inepileptic patients. Because the doses used in bipolar disorder are generallysimilar to those used in epileptic patients, the findings can probably beextrapolated to bipolar patients. In mania, however, the doses needed are oftenhigher, meaning that the results do not necessarily apply. Reports are availableon the following:.Carbamazepine: small risk of cognitive impairment on chronic doses; somereports on cognitive improvement (Loiseau, 2002)..Gabapentin: no negative effects reported (Ramsay and Pryor, 2002)..Lamotrigine: no negative effects reported (Stephen and Brodie, 2002)..Tiagabine: some improvement in therapy responders (Schachter, 2002;Sommerville, 2002)..Topiramate: cognitive slowing, impairment of verbal memory, word-findingdifficulties, reduced psychomotor speed (Sachdeo and Karia, 2002)..Valproic acid: generally minimal effect on cognitive function; individualcases with clinically relevant impairment (Genton and Gelisse, 2002).In conclusion and, although specific studies in patients with affective disordersare lacking, the majority of these compounds do not appear to cause significantproblems with regard to their impact upon cognitive function.7.4 ANTIANXIET Y DRUGS7.4.1 COGNITIVE CHANGES IN ANXIETY DISORDERSStage fright and its consequences on cognitive performance, e.g. suddenforgetting of previously well-remembered material in a test situation, illustratethat states of intensive emotional arousal, including situational anxiety, canlead to transient partial amnesia, i.e. the inability to retrieve information frommemory. Despite these common experiences there appears to be a lack ofsystematic study of cognitive deficiencies in patients suffering from generalizedanxiety disorder, panic disorder or social anxiety disorder. According toHindmarch (1998) ‘‘it is possible to argue that cognitive dysfunction of one sortPSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION241"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"or another is a characteristic feature of anxiety in all its manifestations’’;however, there does not seem to be much clinical or experimental evidence tosupport and specify this statement. Similarly, although there is a vast literatureon the pathophysiology and biology of anxiety disorders (e.g. Stein and Uhde,1998), the relationship between the hypothetical biological pathways under-lying panic disorder, social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), etc.and the mechanisms of cognitive failure have not been elucidated.A recent review (Belanoffet al., 2001) lists some 50 studies dealing withshort- and long-term relationships between circulating corticosteroids andcognitive function in patients with affective disorder, Alzheimer disease orCushing’s syndrome as well as in young and old healthy volunteers – but not asingle investigation on one of the anxiety syndromes. Needless to say thatstudies in patients with anxiety disorder would be of great interest becauseglucocorticoids such as cortisol are released by the adrenal cortex in responseto a wide range of stressors, including acute and chronic anxiety, and there isevidence that excessive circulating levels of corticosteroids can be associatedwith cognitive impairment in healthy subjects and in patients with mentaldisorder. In the absence of published findings from patients with anxietydisorder it is noteworthy that studies in young and old healthy subjects pointedtoward a negative relationship between (pharmacologically manipulated orphysiologically changing) cortisol levels and cognitive performance (table 1 inBelanoffet al., 2001). Based on these experimental findings and on clinicalobservation, it appears safe to assume that at least some patients with anxietysyndromes experience shorter or longer episodes of cognitive impairment.7.4.2 EFFECTS OF BENZODIAZEPINESBenzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics such as diazepam, oxazepam,lorazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam have dose-dependent sedative, myo-relaxant and memory-impairing activities, and the question arose early on as towhether the effect of the drugs on learning and memory is part of their generalsedative action (Chapter 3) or should be considered a specific effect. If theamnestic effect of benzodiazepines were specific, it would arise even with lowand possibly subtherapeutic doses; if non-specific, amnesia could in principlebe avoided by careful individual dosage adjustment. Another questionconcerns the duration of the memory-impairing activity of benzodiazepinesduring therapeutic use: is there attenuation of these effects after a few days inthe same way as with general sedation, or are learning and memoryimpairments to be expected even after weeks or months of chronicadministration?The fact that single-dose administration of benzodiazepines could havemarked amnestic effects was first recognized in anesthesiology where thesedrugs are used to relax and sedate patients prior to surgery. It was found that,242PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"after surgery and on waking from anesthesia, patients had mostly forgottenevents occurring between the benzodiazepine premedication and the operation(Box 7.4).Box 7.4 Amnestic Effects of Benzodiazepines: a Clinical Experimentin AnesthesiologyIn a controlled clinical experiment George and Dundee (1977) usedvarious benzodiazepines in groups of between 10 and 20 femalepatients immediately before minor surgery in order to achievepreoperative sedation. The drugs used were diazepam (10 and20 mg), flunitrazepam (1 and 2 mg) and lorazepam (4 mg). Afterintravenous injection of the benzodiapezine, each patient wasshown ten pictures at fixed intervals, the content of which they hadto name while the nurse showing the pictures simultaneously notedthe degree of sleepiness. Six hours after the operation, when thepatients had recovered, they were asked which pictures theyremembered (free recall) and were subsequently shown 20 picturesfrom which they could select those previously shown (recognition).The experiment yielded the following results:(1) Some amnesia occurred after all three benzodiazepines,although there were pronounced differences between the threedrugs with regard to the time of onset of action, peak effect andduration of action. For example: the amnestic effect ofdiazepam occurred as soon as 1 min after injection but hadabated completely 60 min later.(2) There was a close relationship between the extent of thememory impairment for a specific picture and the degree ofsleepiness recorded by the nurse at the time when this picturehad been presented.(3) No patient suffered total amnesia for the entire period of theinvestigation and recognition performance was always superiorto free recall.Clinical experiments such as that conducted by George and Dundee (1977)allow the following interpretation: intravenous (and, similarly, high oral) dosesof benzodiazepines cause sleepiness and eventually induce sleep. Despite beingsleepy immediately after the injection, the patients were able to perceive andcorrectly name pictures shown to them before full anesthesia, but they had only alimited ability to remember the pictures later, once the effect of the substance hadPSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION243"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"ceased. Thus, when given before or during the acquisition phase, benzodiaze-pines impair the acquisition and consolidation of new material, the transitionfrom a short-term to a long-term store. The impairment concerns not onlyvisually presented content but also verbally presented words and other materials(Lister, 1985). The action of benzodiazepines in the acquisition phase was shownto be dose dependent (Ghoneimet al., 1984a,b) and, as seen in the experiment ofGeorge and Dundee (1977), has a different duration with different compounds,i.e. is related to the biological half-life of the drug in question.Put in more clinical terms, benzodiazepines can induceanterograde amnesia,i.e., they will negatively affect the registration phase in the informationprocessing scheme reported on p. 68. The question then arises as to whether, ifadministered after the registration phase, benzodiazepines can also affectencoding processes, i.e. the phase of further processing of new information andits linking with existing memory content. This phenomenon, calledretrogradeamnesia, does not seem to occur with benzodiazepines (Curran, 1991):information acquired before drug administration remains accessible even at alater date. It should be noted, however, that the temporal relationships in therecording and processing stages of new information and their preciserelationship to the administration and action of drugs are complex, and thatobservations made in single-dose experiments performed under circumscribed,laboratory-like conditions may not be representative of the more typicalchronic use of anxiolytic drugs.Questions of specificity of the amnestic action of benzodiazepines werediscussed by Curran (1991). Based on her own work and studies by otherauthors she concluded that the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines cannot beexplained fully by their general sedative effects. Furthermore, different types oflearning and memory performances are not altered in the same way bybenzodiazepines: episodic memory is affected more than semantic memory, andvoluntary cognitive processes more than automatic processes. In contrast, thelearning of skills and procedures is hardly affected by benzodiazepines at all.With regard to another important issue, that of the persistence of the amnesticeffects, Taylor and Tinklenberg (1987) stated that this undesirable activity ofbenzodiazepines undergoes rapid habituation on repeated administration.However, in the case of the benzodiazepine anxiolytics, this statement wasbased almost exclusively on clinical impressions and studies in healthy subjects.Thus, in one of the few controlled clinical trials with anxiolytics, Luckiet al.(1986) found that, even after years of administration of benzodiazepines inmedium to large doses, each additional individual dose could lead to mildanterograde amnesia. This observation suggests that, although tolerance to thesedative effects of benzodiazepines may develop in some areas of performance,there is less tolerance with regard to memory performance.Golomboket al.(1988) reported on a retrospective study in long-term (morethan 1 year) users of benzodiazepines. They found a negative correlation244PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"between the cumulative dose of medicine over 1 year and the performance insome attention and learning tests. The higher the cumulative anxiolytic dose,the poorer the performance. On the other hand Curran (1992b), in a study oflong-term benzodiazepine consumers (7 months to 28 years!), established thatan individually adjusted normal daily dose had little influence on most aspectsof performance, including learning and memory tests. The only exception was atwo-stage word-pair association test that indicated some decrement afterbenzodiazepine anxiolytics. In a review of various studies, Curran concluded‘‘that the repeated use of benzodiazepines over weeks does not lead to toleranceof episodic memory impairments’’ (1991, p. 6). In another review article, King(1992, p. 84) commented that, with regard to habituation, the amnestic actionof benzodiazepines lay between the general sedative action (which showedrapid habituation) and the anxiolytic action (which did not show habituation).There has been discussion as to whether some benzodiazepines may, perhapsas a consequence of particularly high affinity for specific benzodiazepinesubreceptors, be able to induce greater or less important disturbance ofcognitive functions than others. According to Hindmarch (1998), thebenzodiazepine clobazam has anticonvulsant and anxiolytic but no sedativeand amnestic properties at the usual doses and should be given preference,particularly in the treatment of elderly patients with anxiety disorder.Unresolved issues around benzodiazepines include the observation that someof these compounds with short plasma half-lives have prolonged effects oncognitive function including memory, whereas other derivatives with long-livedand pharmacologically active metabolites do not show these effects (Ghoneimand Mewaldt, 1990). Ghoneim (1992) also reported that the sedative–hypnoticactions of benzodiazepines could be abolished with benzodiazepine antago-nists, whereas the amnestic effects of these drugs were at least partially resistantto antagonists. Another controversial issue that will be dealt with in Chapter 8are the possible consequences of benzodiazepine action on learning andmemory when a patient is receiving concomitant psychotherapy, i.e., isexpected to acquire new behaviors and cognitive patterns.In conclusion, although there has been extensive research into the cognitiveeffects of benzodiazepines for more than 30 years, knowledge in this area ofpsychopharmacology remains patchy. There is a consensus, however, that oldpatients in particular are at risk for cognitive disturbances when beingprescribed benzodiazepines (Foyet al., 1995; Ranstamet al., 1997; Hanlonetal., 1998), and that alternative anxiolytic drugs should be given preference ifpossible.7.4.3 OTHER ANXIOLYTIC DRUGSAs indicated in Chapter 1 some antidepressant drugs, particularly SSRIs andSNRIs, are being used increasingly for the pharmacotherapy of anxietyPSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION245"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"disorders. Although these drugs are not devoid of adverse effects, they appearto have little effect on cognitive functions (Section 7.3.2). Their use for thelong-term treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and panicdisorder, notably in elderly patients, is therefore encouraged.Another alternative is buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic thatseems to be free of untoward effects on cognitive performance (Ninanet al.,1998). As indicated in Chapter 1, the anxiolytic effect of this compound maytake a few weeks to occur (and is often rather weak), meaning that buspirone isbetter suited for long-term treatment of anxiety syndromes than for immediateanxiolysis.7.5 PSYCHOSTIMULANTS7.5.1 COGNITIVE ABNORMALITIES IN ATTENTION DEFICITHYPERACTIVITY DISORDERThe most frequent psychiatric use of psychostimulant drugs is in children andadolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Given thispreferential use, and in view of the controversies around the chronicadministration of potentially addictive drugs in a juvenile population, thefollowing section will focus on the effects of psychostimulants on cognitivefunction in children and adolescents with ADHD. When addressing this topicit is important to recall that the three cardinal symptoms required for adiagnosis of ADHD – developmentally inappropriate hyperactivity, impulsiv-ity and inattention – do not explicitly comprise cognitive dysfunction. It is,however, easy to imagine that all three behavioral characteristics are likely totranslate into deficient performance in a variety of tasks, including tests ofcognitive function.The DSM-IV (APA, 1994), which distinguishes three subtypes of ADHD – apredominantly inattentive type, a predominantly hyperactive–impulsive typeand a combined type – lists nine behavioral criteria of which six must befulfilled for the diagnostic label of ‘inattention’:.Failure to give close attention to detail.Difficulty with sustained attention.Does not seem to listen.Does not follow through on instructions.Has difficulty organizing tasks and activities.Avoids tasks that require sustained mental effort.Loses things he/she needs for tasks or activities.Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.Is often forgetful246PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"In the context of tests of cognitive function, most or all of these behavioralcharacteristics are likely to interfere with optimal performance. However, poorperformance on tests of cognitive function are neither necessary nor sufficientfor a diagnosis of ADHD: the DSM-IV stipulates that clinically significantimpairment in social, academic or occupational functioning (due to the abovesymptoms) must be notable in two or more settings for a diagnosis of ADHDto be made.Neuropsychological testing of children with ADHD suggests deficits inexecutive functioning and working memory (Stubbe, 2000). Poorer perfor-mance than in age-matched healthy children is recorded on a wide variety oftasks such as perceptual discrimination, reaction time, vigilance, continuousperformance, rote learning, paired associate learning, etc. According to onecurrent school of thinking (see Crosbie and Schachar, 2001), ‘‘deficientinhibition’’ constitutes a core disturbance in ADHD: deficient inhibitorycontrol is assumed to be responsible for a number of impairments in behavior,working memory, impulse regulation and internalization of speech. Thesedeficits underlie the abnormalities of conduct exhibited by ADHD individualsin everyday life, as well as the impulsive, inattentive and inconsistent behaviorexhibited on a variety of tasks. Deficient inhibitory control can beoperationalized and measured by means of the stop-signal paradigm (Schacharet al., 2000), a laboratory task that requires a rapid ongoing motor responseand the sudden cessation of that response following a specified signal.However, not all children with ADHD perform poorly on the stop-signal task,and by far not all ADHD children and adolescents show consistently deficientperformance on cognitive tasks and in school.7.5.2 EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSTIMULANTSThere is a large number of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlledstudies demonstrating the efficacy of psychostimulant drugs in improvingbehavioral symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in ADHD patients (for reviewsee Wilens and Biederman, 1992; Greenhillet al., 1999). Methylphenidate is thedrug most frequently studied, but amphetamine and pemoline show similarefficacy. The vast majority of clinical trials included children between 5 and 12years of age, and it is generally recognized that studies in children will producemore consistently positive results than trials in adolescents or adults.Responder rates in children are as high as 75%; children with comorbidanxiety and those who have less severe symptoms generally do not respond aswell (Gray and Kagan, 2000). Most published studies lasted up to 12 weeks,with improvement seen in the following areas of cognitive functioning:.Attentiveness and on-task behavior.

According to Klormanet al.(1994), methylphenidate and chronological age had generally similar effectsin a Sternberg (continuous short-term memory) task: greater accuracy andspeed (as well as more ‘mature’ event-related potential patterns) were seenafter methylphenidate both in ADHD and in non-ADHD children.It is also recognized that scholastic achievement of children with ADHDimproves significantly on psychostimulant treatment, although not as dramati-cally as behavior: according to Greenhillet al.(1999) effect sizes on cognitivemeasures are typically between 0.6 and 0.8, whereas those on behavioralmeasures, based on teachers’ reports, are slightly higher (0.8–1.0). On the otherhand it generally takes lower doses of stimulant drugs to improve cognitive andscholastic performance than to obtain better behavioral manageability (Cantwell,1996; Eliaet al., 1999). Regarding the optimal dosing and scheduling ofpsychostimulant drugs, several issues have been discussed repeatedly:(1) Dose–response relationship on cognitive tasks: although some early studiessuggested a plateau or even a reversed effect at higher drug doses, mostcontrolled trials with methylphenidate support a linear dose–responserelationship up to 0.9 mg/kg. Higher doses of methylphenidate (0.9 mg/kg)were found to be particularly effective on tasks with high cognitiveprocessing load (Bermanet al., 1999).(2) Paradoxical effects: cognitive impairment and perseverative behavior areoccasionally seen in children treated with psychostimulants. According toGreenhillet al.(1999) such phenomena are indicative of a drug overdoseand will improve at dose reduction. Constriction of attention or‘overfocusing’ as a consequence of treatment with psychostimulants hasbeen another critical issue (Breggin, 1999). Based on an extensive review ofthe literature and their own experience, Wilens and Biederman (1992)assert that there is no evidence of such phenomena at doses up to 1.0 mg/kgof methylphenidate.(3) Rebound effects: methylphenidate and amphetamine are short-actingdrugs and, consequently, one often observes reappearance of symptoms inthe afternoon if the drug is taken early in the morning. Controlled studieswith staggered administration of active drug and placebo have shown thata return of symptoms during the day is due to waning of the drug actionafter a few hours and not to a rebound effect.

The children suffered from severe attentiondeficits and 42% had comorbid diagnoses including mild mentalretardation, autistic features, oppositional defiant disorder and ticdisorder. They were included in a parallel-group, randomized,double-blind, placebo-controlled study of amphetamine treatment.All patients had a 3-month single-blind baseline amphetaminetitration period and all 62 patients improved significantly duringthis time. They were then randomized to amphetamine or placebo.During the 12-month double-blind phase, 71% of the children inthe placebo group and 29% in the amphetamine group stoppedtreatment or were switched to open treatment. Most of thesedropouts occurred in the first 3 months of the double-blind trial.Thirty-two children (8 on placebo and 24 on amphetamine)completed the study as planned. Early dropouts were consideredin a separate statistical analysis.Behavioral symptoms were assessed by means of a parent ratingscale (Conners, 1990). There were highly significant differencesbetween the children taking amphetamine and those taking placeboon the total behavior score as well as on all subscores. Teacherclassroom scores (Conners, 1990) followed the same pattern,clearly favoring amphetamine. Improvements were 43–47% on theparent scores and 27–40% in the classroom. Clinical results weresimilar in the pure ADHD and in the comorbid group. Changes incognitive performance were measured by means of the WechslerIntelligence Scale for Children, 3rd edition revised (WISC-R;Wechsler, 1992). Data available from eight children taking placebofor 6 months or longer were compared with those having takenamphetamine for 9 months or more (n¼35) and indicated a slightadvantage for the children on amphetamine (change of 4.5 pointsfrom baseline to month 15, compared with a change of 0.7 onplacebo during the same time interval;P50.05, one-tailed). Verbaland performance scores on the WISC-R showed similar results.The small but statistically significant effect seen in the ampheta-mine group on the WISC-R was probably a real finding, i.e. not anartifact of retesting.

Several controlled studies on SDL,with conflicting results, were also performed in ADHD children (Spiegel1996, p. 203); despite its potential importance, it appears that the topic hasnot been revisited in the last few years.Probably the two most contentious issues in the treatment of ADHD withpsychostimulants are the long-term efficacy of these drugs and the long-termoutcome of patients. Beneficial effects of methylphenidate and similar drugs onsymptoms of ADHD were typically demonstrated in controlled trials of a fewweeks duration; however, ADHD is a chronic condition and its symptomsusually reappear upon discontinuation of pharmacological treatment. Twoquestions thus arise: are stimulant drugs effective long-term, i.e. after years ofuse; and what is the long-term prognosis of children with ADHD? Scientificallysound answers to both questions would necessitate long-term, placebo-controlled studies, yet it is ethically problematic and practically not feasibleto keep ADHD patients with clinically relevant symptoms without activetreatment for years. As far as the efficacy of psychostimulants beyond a fewmonths is concerned there are now several published controlled studies, alllasting 12 months or longer, indicating that the efficacy of stimulant drugs ismaintained. Two of these studies, one with amphetamine and one withmethylphenidate, are summarized in Boxes 7.5 and 7.6.Box 7.6 The MTA Study (Multimodal Treatment Study of Childrenwith ADHD)Probably the largest and most thoroughly prepared, performed andanalyzed treatment study in ADHD was sponsored by the USNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the US DepartmentofEducationinresponsetopublicconcernregardingtheuseofstimulant medication use in children and adolescents (MTACooperativeGroup,1999).Atotalof579children(80%boys;screened from more than 4500 candidates) were recruited in six centershaving extensive experience with ADHD; the children were between 7and 9.9 years of age and had a diagnosis of ADHD, combined type.After extensive baseline investigations they were assigned randomly to14 months of four different management strategies:250PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"(1) Medication only: individual titration of methylphenidate,followed by monthly visits.(2) Behavioral treatment: intensive parent training, school-basedintervention and child-focused treatment, with therapistinvolvement gradually reduced over time.(3) Combined medication and behavioral treatment.(4) Community care: treatment by community mental healthproviders (about two-thirds of these children received stimulantmedication through their doctors).Clinical outcomes before, during and after treatments wereassessed in six multiple domains represented by 19 separatemeasures. The domains were: ADHD symptoms; aggression-oppositional defiant disorder; internalizing symptoms; social skills;parent–child relations; and cognitive performance (measured withthree subscales of the Wechsler Individual Achievement test:reading, mathematics, spelling).All four treatment groups showed sizable reductions insymptoms over time, with significant differences between thegroups in degrees of change. For most ADHD symptoms, childrenin the combined treatment and medication management groupsshowed significantly greater improvement than those givenbehavioral treatment or community care. Combined and medica-tion management treatments did not differ significantly on anydirect comparisons, but in several instances the combined treat-ment proved superior to behavioral treatment and/or communitycare while the medication management did not.With few exceptions the Wechsler scores showed small positiveaverage changes within all four groups. The combined treatmentgroup had the largest and the community care group had thesmallest baseline-adjusted change scores on all three cognitivemeasures. Statistically significant differences were found betweenthe combined and the behavioral treatment groups and between thecombined treatment and the community care groups, both onthe reading achievement score. In addition to the main findingsregarding the best average treatment effects, this study shows thatthe cognitive performance of ADHD children was slightlyenhanced as part of a more general clinical improvement onseveral of the treatments, and that clinical improvement as well asslight cognitive enhancement is observed after months of treatmentwith a stimulant drug used alone or in combination with anintensive behavioral treatment program.PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION251"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"The Swedish study (Gillberget al., 1997) as well as the MTA study (MTACooperative Group, 1999) from the USA showed that the stimulant drugs usedmaintained their efficacy on behavioral as well as cognitive measures in ADHDfor at least 1 year. This supports observations made in naturalistic long-termstudies that tolerance to the effects of amphetamine and methylphenidate doesnot develop in children and adolescents suffering from ADHD. The picture isless clear with regard to the outcome of ADHD in adulthood: several long-term, controlled follow-up studies suggest that the syndrome may persist in 10–60% of young adults diagnosed as having ADHD in childhood (Wilenset al.,1998). The actual contribution of drug therapy to these long-term outcomes isdifficult to estimate because medication used for some time in childhood mayhave been discontinued and resumed again for some time, and many non-drug-related factors are likely to have intervened between childhood, adolescenceand early adulthood.7.6 ANTIDEMENTIA DRUGS7.6.1 COGNITIVE CHANGES OFAGING AND DEMENTIASome change in cognitive functioning with advancing age is considered normal.Older people are thought of as being forgetful: they may not remember eventsand conversations, keep asking the same question, sometimes have problemsfinding words, go out shopping and forget what they wanted to buy. Theselapses are part of a complex of changes that occur in the sensory, motor andcognitive faculties of people as they grow older: accuracy and speed of sensoryperception and voluntary motor activity diminish, and attentiveness, interestsand motivation change during the course of life (Craik and Salthouse, 1992).Interindividual variation increases with age in practically all areas examined,and the normal range of physiological as well as psychological functioning iswider in older than in young persons. Cognitive performance in older age alsodepends on education and previous professional activities; it is additionallyaffected by the general state of health of the individual.However, aging is not related to a general decline in intellectual abilities.Losses occur mainly in areas of performance that are directly dependent onintact sensory and motor abilities. Older persons also tend to encounterdifficulties when called upon to perform cognitive and other tasks underpressure of time. The subjective significance of a task and a person’s familiaritywith the conditions under which performance is evaluated are further factorsthat assume greater importance in older people than in the young.When an elderly, physically healthy person shows a generalized decline incognitive functioning that ‘‘causes significant impairment in social oroccupational functioning and represents a significant decline from a previous252PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"level of functioning’’ (APA, 1994), there is the possibility ofdementia.Dementia (‘loss of mind’) designates a syndrome characterized by ‘‘globaldeterioration in all aspects of mental functioning, including memory, generalintellect, emotional attributes and distinctive features of personality’’ (Roth,1980). A diagnosis of dementia presumes deterioration in several areas ofmental functioning and not just of memory (although memory impairment is anecessary condition for a diagnosis of dementia). Dementias are common inthe very old: about 5% of all persons over 65 years and about 20% of all thoseaged 80 years are to be classed as demented (Henderson, 1986). According topresent-day views, the number of individuals over 65 years affected bydementia doubles for every 5 years or so of life.A dementia syndrome may be caused by a number of underlying diseasesthat can be detected or excluded by medical, neurological and psychiatricexaminations (Smallet al., 1997). The most common cause, accounting for55% of all chronic cases of dementia, is Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Other braindisorders that may underlie dementia are cerebrovascular disease, Lewy bodydisorder (McKeith and Burn, 2000), frontotemporal degeneration (Snowdenand Neary, 1999) and others (Fig. 7.1). Reversible causes of dementiasyndromes include depression (Geerlingset al., 2000), some endocrinedisorders, dietary deficiencies and drug overdosage (Starr and Whalley, 1994).7.6.2 ALZHEIMER’S DISEASEThe clinical hallmark of AD is gradual and irreversible cognitive decline. Thismanifests initially with symptoms of memory failure and ‘mild cognitivePSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION253Figure 7.1Differential diagnosis of dementia (AD¼Alzheimer’s disease; DLBD¼dementia with Lewy body disorder; DLB¼dementia with Lewy bodies)"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"impairment’ (MCI) that is insufficient to significantly affect daily functioning.The MCI is often, but not always, followed by more severe mental decline: it isestimated that 10–15% of individuals with MCI will convert to dementiawithin 1 year (Petersenet al., 2001a). For this reason, a recent practiceguideline (Petersenet al., 2001b) recommends the evaluation and clinicalmonitoring of persons with MCI.Dementia due to AD steadily worsens, typically over the course of about 10years, but survival in some patients may be as short as 3–4 years. In late stagesAD leads to what is sometimes called a vegetative state, i.e. the patient isbedfast and totally dependent on others for all basic living activities. Patientswith AD typically die from bronchitis or pneumonia. Risk factors of AD areage, female gender and presence of the apolipoproteine4 (APOe4) allele.Higher levels of education, moderate levels of daily wine consumption andhigher levels of fish in the diet have been associated with a lower risk for AD(Cummings and Cole, 2002).Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic, progressive and degenerative brain disease. Itis macroscopically characterized by atrophy of the cerebral cortex, which, at leastin advanced stages, can be detected by computer-assisted tomography (CAT) ormagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). So-called neuritic plaques (extracellulardeposits of beta-amyloid in the brain), neurofibrillary modifications (tangles),neuron loss and other abnormalities are characteristic microscopic features(Katzman, 1986). Because there is as yet no specific clinical, biochemical orneurological test for a diagnosis of AD in the living patient, unequivocaldiagnosis can strictly be made only by postmortem examination of the brain.Using a set of diagnostic rules (McKhannet al., 1984) one can reach about80–90% agreement between the clinical and postmortem diagnosis.The symptoms of AD are not restricted to the cognitive domain but includethe following:.Apathy is apparent early in the clinical course, with diminished interest andreduced concern..Agitation and aimless activity become increasingly common as the illnessadvances and are a frequent precipitant of nursing home placement..Depressive symptoms are present in about 50% of patients, andapproximately 25% exhibit delusions at some stage of the disorder.Assessment methods that determine mental functioning (attention, orientation,memory, speech, understanding of speech, psychomotor functions) in a simple,practical way are recommended for a rough estimation of the severity ofdementia. The best-known instrument is the Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE, Folsteinet al., 1975), which allows the grading of dementia on a 30-point scale on the basis of a simple 5–10-min examination. Other, rather moreinvolved procedures include the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) of Mattis (1976)and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) of Rosenet al.(1984). The254PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Consortium for the Establishment of a Registry of Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD;Heymanet al., 1997) has worked out a minimum standard battery to describe thecognitive dysfunction of patients with AD. Specific neuropsychological tech-niques can be applied for a more detailed description of the mental functions thatare still retained and those that are impaired (see Deutsch Lezak, 1995).7.6.3 CHOLINERGIC AGENTSIn addition to containing markedly increased numbers of amyloid plaques andneurofibrillary tangles, brains of patients with AD also show significantdisturbance of chemical neurotransmission. The noradrenergic, serotoninergicand several other neurotransmitter systems are affected, but the mostpronounced dysfunction is found in the cholinergic brain systems. As discussedin Chapter 2 (pp. 53 f.), thecholinergic hypothesis of ADintegrated numerousclinical, neurochemical and pharmacological findings and was a basis forrational drug development to treat the disease. Most currently approvedantidementia drugs are cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is), i.e. compounds thatinhibit the enzymatic breakdown of acetylcholine and thus raise the availabilityof the neurotransmitter. The three most frequently used ChE-Is are donepezil(Aricept1), rivastigmine (Exelon1) and galanthamine (Reminyl1) (Table 7.2).When treated with one of the ChE-Is the majority of patients with AD willshow stabilization or slight improvement of their remaining cognitive abilitiesand everyday functioning for at least 6 months (Wolfsonet al., 2002) or evenlonger (Giacobini, 2000; Gauthier, 2002). About one in five patients is likely tomanifest clinically relevant improvement of cognitive performance and ADL(activities of daily life) when treated with a ChE-I. However, mental andfunctional decline will continue unchanged in about 25% of patients despitepharmacological treatment. The effect size of treatment with ChE-Is dependson the severity of the disorder when therapy is initiated: in controlled clinicalstudies, patients with more severe dementia showed a much greater therapeuticeffect, i.e. a greater difference between active drug and placebo, than patientswith mild AD (Burnset al., 2002; Potkinet al., 2002). This is probably due tothe fact that the brain cholinergic deficit is more pronounced in severe AD(Daviset al., 1999), leading to faster and more profound loss of cognitive andfunctional abilities in these patients if left untreated. On the other hand, there isalso evidence that treatment with ChE-Is should be initiated as early aspossible because the cognitive and functional losses incurred early in thedisease cannot be recovered fully when pharmacological intervention is delayed(Doraiswamyet al., 2002).Many AD patients, especially those in advanced stages of the disorder, sufferfrom serious behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (acronym:BPSD), making their own life and that of their family or professionalcaregivers difficult. Studies in institutionalized AD patients with BPSD indicatePSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION255"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"that ChE-Is can be effective against symptoms such as hallucinations,delusions, aggressiveness and aimless wandering. In some cases ChE-Is mayeven replace the psychiatric drugs, e.g. antipsychotics, that are used routinelyto deal with BPSD but are likely to produce serious side effects in old patients.A placebo-controlled study with rivastigmine in patients suffering fromdementia with Lewy bodies (a form of degenerative dementia accompaniedby serious psychiatric and neurological symptoms) demonstrated significantclinical benefit (McKeithet al., 2000) and thus supports the use of ChE-Is inpatients with BPSD.7.6.4 NON-CHOLINERGIC APPROACHES TO ADCholinesterase inhibitors are the only class of drugs currently approved bymost Health Authorities and recommended by professional associations (e.g.Doodyet al., 2001) for the symptomatic treatment of AD. However, ChE-Isintervene at a late stage of the pathophysiological cascade leading to AD(Fig. 7.2); furthermore, their efficacy is limited and they may cause a number ofside effects, most frequently nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia and dizziness.For these reasons, major efforts are being made to alter the biological processes256PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 7. 2Commonly used cholinesterase inhibitors (for details see Jannet al., 2002)DonepezilRivastigmineGalanthamineChemical class PiperidineCarbamatePhenanthrene alkaloidOriginSyntheticcompoundSyntheticcompoundNatural product (fromthe flower snowdrop)EnzymesinhibitedAcetylcholinesterase(AChE)AChE, butyryl-cholinesterase(BuChE)AChEInhibition type Rapidly reversible Slowly reversibleRapidly reversibleBrain selectivity YesYesNoAdministration Once dailyTwice dailyTwice dailyDosageStart with 5 mg/day;increase to 10 mg/day after about 1month; maximum10 mg/dayStart with 3 mg/day;increase to 6 mg/day after about 1month; maximum12 mg/dayStart with 8 mg/day;increase to 16 mg/day after about 1month; maximum24 mg/dayMetabolismrouteCytochrome P-450isoenzymesTarget enzymes:AChE and BuChECytochrome P-450isoenzymes"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"leading to AD at an earlier stage, and eventually to prevent the outbreak of thedisorder. From the many approaches that are currently discussed (Jacobsen,2002), two relatively advanced ones will be mentioned briefly in the followingparagraphs: the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and cholesterol inhibitors.Anti-inflammatory drugsRegular consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)such as diclofenac, ibuprofen or naproxen may reduce the risk of developingAD. Retrospective case–control investigations show that individuals who usedthese drugs for some time against rheumatic or arthritic conditions weresignificantly less frequently diagnosed with AD. These observations supportthe concept that inflammatory processes and mediators are involved in thecomplicated sequence of pathogenetic events (Figure 7.2; Hoozemanset al.,2002) that ultimately lead to AD. Specific issues that remained open until a fewyears ago were the doses of NSAIDs needed, the minimum duration of NSAIDuse required and the optimal timing (beginning and end) of NSAIDconsumption to attain maximum protection against AD. A recently publishedinvestigation from Holland appears to answer some of these questions: In’tPSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION257Genetic baseMissense mutations in APP and presenilin genes+Core pathologicalIncreased Ab42 production and accumulation*process+Ab42 oligomerization and deposition asdiffuse plaques+Subtle effects of Aboligomers on synapses+Inflammatory processMicroglial and astrocytic activation:complement factors, cytokines, etc.**+Progressive synaptic and neuritic injury+Altered neuronal ionic homeostasis; oxidative injury+Altered kinase/phosphatase activities!tangles+Widespread neuronal/neuritic dysfunction and cell death with transmitter deficitsFigure 7.2Amyloid cascade hypothesis (modified after Hardy and Selkoe, 2002.Reprinted with permission.

Within anaverage follow-up period of 6.8 years, 394 of the study participants developeddementia (293 AD, 56 vascular dementia, 45 other types of dementia). Theobserved risk of developing AD then was related to the use of NSAIDs asdocumented in pharmacy records, resulting in the following relative risks ofdeveloping AD:.Patients with short-term (up to 1 month) use of NSAIDs during theobservation period had a relative risk of 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.70–1.29)..Patients with intermediate-term (more than 1 month, up to 2 years) use ofNSAIDs had a slightly reduced relative risk of 0.83 (95% confidenceinterval¼0.62–1.11)..Patients with long-term (at least 2 years) use of NSAIDs had a substantiallyreduced relative risk of 0.20 (95% confidence interval¼0.05–0.83).Age and apolipoprotein E status did not alter these relationships, and the riskof developing vascular dementia was not affected by NSAID consumption.According to In’t Veldet al.the protective effects of NSAIDs did not dependon the dose used, and the calculated benefit was greater when the drugs weretaken at least 2 years before the (model-based) onset of AD. As pointed out byBreitner and Zandi (2001), these observations suggest that there is a criticalperiod for intervention in the disease process leading to AD, i.e. preventivetreatment with NSAIDs should be initiated at an early prodromal stage of thedisorder, e.g. in MCI. It is hoped that ongoing trials with NSAIDs will provideevidence for or against these assumptions.Cholesterol InhibitorsPossibly still further up the pathogenetic cascade (see Fig. 7.2), evidence hasaccumulated that a specific class of cholesterol-lowering drugs may inhibit theformation of beta-amyloid and thus prevent the development of AD. Asmentioned earlier, brains of AD patients show an accumulation of plaques thatare composed mainly ofb-amyloid, a peptide consisting of 40–42 amino acidsderived from the (non-pathological) amyloid precursor protein (APP). It iswidely accepted today that excessive formation and accumulation ofb-amyloidin the brain is critical for the initiation and progression of AD (Hardy andSelkoe, 2002). Increased cholesterol levels in blood and/or brain are thought tofacilitate the pathological enzymatic step from APP tob-amyloid, implyingthat patients with abnormally high levels of cholesterol in blood (hyperlipid-emia) run a greater risk of developing AD. Epidemiological studies have in factrevealed an association of hyperlipidemia and AD, and it has been shown alsothat hyperlipidemic patients treated with lipid-lowering agents (HMG-CoA258PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"reductase inhibitors, so-called statins) have a significantly smaller incidence ofAD than untreated or non-statin-treated hyperlipidemic patients (Wolozin,2002). Although the mechanisms underlying the preventive effect of statins inAD still need to be elucidated (Crisbyet al., 2002), these generally well-tolerated drugs deserve to be tested systematically in persons with a higher riskof AD, e.g. individuals with MCI. As is the case for anti-inflammatorycompounds, Phase II studies with several statins are currently underway andare expected to provide the necessary clinical information within a few years.7.7 CONCLUDING REMARKSCognitive impairment is seen in many psychiatric and neurological disorders.For disorders such as AD, cognitive decline constitutes a key diagnostic andpsychopathologic feature; in other cases, e.g. in depression and anxietydisorders, cognitive impairment may be an epiphenomenon rather than a corepathognomonic element. These differences also imply different expectancieswith regard to the drugs used to treat mental and neurological diseases: ADpatients’ cognitive performance should definitely profit from treatment withantidementia drugs; patients with depression and anxiety disorder shouldprimarily not deteriorate when being treated with antidepressants andanxiolytics. As shown in the preceding paragraphs, the distinction betweendirect, beneficial drug effects, e.g. on symptoms of schizophrenia anddepression, and direct or indirect (positive and negative) effects of thesedrugs on cognitive function is not always straightforward. Although this maybe an attractive area for many more sophisticated studies, in clinical practicedeleterious effects of drugs on performance must be monitored carefully andbalanced against the therapeutic benefit noted in the individual patient.PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION259"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"8Psychopharmaceuticals and theTreatment of Mental DisordersRevision byHOSSEIN FATEMI8.1 INTRODUCTIONIn Chapter 1 of this book, psychopharmaceuticals were introduced as effectivemedicines that primarily have a symptomatic action but are problematic inseveral respects. Antipsychotics can cause serious side effects and antidepressantsoften exert their therapeutic effects only after a delay of weeks and in many caseshave unpleasant side effects. With anxiolytics, hypnotics and, in particular,psychostimulants, there are problems with habituation and the potential ofdependency. It is therefore not surprising that psychopharmaceuticals do notenjoy a very high reputation among many doctors and the general public (see Box8.1) and have been given names such as ‘chemical strait-jackets’ for the olderneuroleptics (Szasz, 1957) or ‘chemical blinkers for the mind’ for tranquillizers.Elomaa (1993) even posed the question of whether the long-term use ofconventional antipsychotics should be considered a crime against humanity.A visit to a psychiatric hospital is also rarely suited to dispelling reservationsabout psychopharmaceuticals. Some patients wander around like robots, theirmovements lack natural animation, their expressions are rigid and they appearpale and apathetic, cut off from their surroundings. An encounter with a relativeor friend suffering from a mental illness and being treated with psychopharma-ceuticals can be shocking and confusing, and the layperson is usually not in aposition to evaluate whether the signs that they see and hear are expressions ofthe illness being treated or the effects of the medicines administered.Psychopharmacology, Fourth Edition.

Medication may beused as a form of punishment for rebelliousness.(2) Psychopharmaceuticals are employed for brainwashing: underthe influence of psychopharmaceuticals the patients becomeindifferent, lose their own will and adapt themselves tocircumstances in an environment that is itself mentally sick.(3) Psychopharmaceuticals encourage ‘revolving door’ psychiatry:patients are often sent home as being ‘cured’ too soon andswiftly return to the clinic. As time goes by, they cease tobelieve in a cure and in themselves.(4) Many doctors prescribe psychopharmaceuticals in order to getrid of difficult patients and so that they do not have to becomemore involved in the problems of their patients.(5) For doctors and patients, psychopharmaceuticals are often thesimplest way out of a difficult situation: drugs suppress a fewacute symptoms but do not lead to a permanent solution forthe basic underlying problems.On the other hand, nurses and doctors who lived through the period before1953/54 and then saw the introduction of modern psychopharmaceuticalscould hardly believe the unprecedented therapeutic advances that thesemedicines provided: how much suffering, anxiety and waste of human lifecould be eliminated inside and outside of psychiatric hospitals. Relief andsometimes elation, together with new therapeutic optimism, can be sensed inthe early publications on the discovery of antipsychotics and antidepressants(see Chapter 2).In the following paragraphs we will attempt to determine more precisely thevalue and position of psychopharmaceuticals in the treatment of mentaldisorders. This will be done on the basis of a literature survey referring, withfew exceptions, to comparative studies between two or more forms of therapy.Historically, the following tendencies can be detected in this area ofcomparative therapeutic research:.In the 1960s and early 1970s, the studies often related to the question ofwhether and in which particular therapeutic indications psychopharmaceu-ticals show superiority over placebo.262PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":".At about the same time, studies were performed to determine whetherpsychopharmaceuticals or specific psychotherapeutic procedures producedbetter results in the treatment of mental disorders, especially schizophreniaand depression..In the last two decades, interest has been directed primarily to the questionof how psychopharmaceuticals and non-drug procedures relate to oneanother and how they can best be combined.Problems of optimal dosage and duration of drug treatment for mentaldisorders have also been addressed in numerous controlled studies and arepresented separately below for antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabi-lizers, anxiolytics and psychostimulants. This division again makes sensebecause the disorders treated and the therapeutic approaches used differ insignificant aspects and the empirical studies carried out in the individualindications show major qualitative and quantitative differences.8.2 ANTIPSYCHOTICS AND THE TREATMENT OFSCHIZOPHRENIA8.2.1 PROOF OF EFFICACYThe efficacy of antipsychotics for the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenicpsychoses is not disputed: a tranquillizing, emotion-subduing and antihallu-cinatory effect can be seen clearly in the majority of patients and has beenconfirmed in a large number of comparative studies versus placebo. Accordingto a compilation by Davis and Casper (1978), even before 1969 there had been66 placebo-controlled studies performed in the USA with chlorpromazine, 18with trifluoperazine, 15 with fluphenazine, 10 with triflupromazine, 9 withhaloperidol and 7 with thioridazine: a vast majority of these studiesdemonstrated the superiority of the active product over placebo. Thetherapeutic effect of the antipsychotics arose in 60–75% of patients duringthe first 6 weeks of treatment, although later improvements were also observed.The symptoms most perceptibly improved by the use of antipsychotics were:.psychotic thought disorder, paranoid ideation.hallucinations.mannerisms.autism.general slowness or motor hyperactivity.withdrawal, hostility.affective blunting and indifferenceAccording to a formulation of Heinrich (1976, p. 27), ‘‘psychotic syndromes whichare characterized by a lively emotional mobility, wealth of symptoms, activePSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS263"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"confrontation with one’s own disease and with one’s surroundings, react fromexperience appreciably better to neuroleptic drug therapy than do thosesyndromes which are, as it were, burnt out, torpid, lacking in symptoms, andemotionally frozen’’. The prospects for patients with schizophrenia simplex andwithschizophrenicdefectorresidualsyndromesarelessfavorablethanforpatientshaving catatonic and paranoid–hallucinatory schizophrenias (Crow, 1982).In connection with the introduction of newer, ‘atypical’ antipsychotics, thequestion arose as to whether and to what degree these drugs have a beneficialeffect not only on the positive (or productive) symptoms of schizophrenia butalso on the negative part of the schizophrenic syndrome (apathy, socialwithdrawal, emotional blunting, impoverishment of thought and speech).Mo ̈ller (1995) emphasized thatnegative symptomsare observed at variousstages of schizophrenic psychosis and are therefore to be evaluateddifferentially also. Depending on the type and stage of psychosis, they occurin association with positive symptoms or are separate, and they also respond ina differential way to antipsychotics. One can speak of a particularly marked oreven a specific effect of an antipsychotic on negative symptoms only when apreparation acts on apathy, social withdrawal, etc. after the acute positivesymptoms have faded, but especially in patients with schizophrenic defect orchronic deficit state. This type of effect has been obtained convincingly with theatypical antipsychotic clozapine, which also is used successfully in cases of so-called treatment resistance (Farmer and Blewett, 1993). Additionally, Duganet al. (2001) compared several studies of olanzapine against typicalantipsychotics and found advantages for olanzapine in terms of positive andnegative symptoms, depression and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Incontrast, a recent meta-analysis (Geddeset al., 2000) did not produce clearevidence that atypical agents are more effective or better tolerated thanconventional antipsychotics. Geddeset al. concluded that ‘‘conventionalantipsychotics should usually be used in the initial treatment of an episode ofschizophrenia unless the patient has previously not responded to these drugs orhas unacceptable extrapyramidal side effects’’. Nevertheless, the overall clinicalwisdom based on recent evidence is that, because of the propensity for atypicalantipsychotics to cause fewer EPS, the potential benefit in amelioration of bothnegative and positive symptoms and the superiority in treating treatment-unresponsive patients, atypical agents should be tried initially in any patientwith psychosis (Bradfordet al., 2002).8.2.2 QUESTIONS OF DOSAGE AND DURATION OF TREATMENTThere may be considerable differences between the lowest and the highestrecommended doses for antipsychotics (see Table 1.2 in Chapter 1). The majorfactors responsible for the wide dosage range are the weight and age of thepatients, their general physical health and the type and severity of the mental264PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"disorders. Baldessarini emphasized (1985, p. 48) that ‘‘there have been very fewsystematic investigations of dose–effect relationships, or comparisons ofspecific types of agents, in large numbers of psychotic patients diagnosed byreliable methods’’. The published doses for antipsychotics therefore should beseen only as rough guidelines and the dosage must be tailor-made individuallyon the basis of the symptoms to be treated and tolerability.Two dose–effect studies with haloperidol allow a statement to be maderegarding adequate doses, at least for this antipsychotic: a double-blindcomparison between daily doses of 10, 30 and 80 mg of haloperidol in 87recently hospitalized patients with schizophrenia revealed no advantage of thetwo higher doses over the dose of 10 mg per day (Rifkinet al., 1991), and a studyby McEvoyet al.(1991) in 106 patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffectivepsychoses showed that an increase in dose above an individually optimal level(mostly less than 10 mg per day in this study) produced no additionaltherapeutic effect but rather an increase in side effects, especially EPS.Despite the clear trend towards lower doses seen in recent years, one shouldalso warn against experimenting with inadequate dosesat the beginning of atreatment: especially in younger, physically healthy patients it is important toachieve a rapid antipsychotic action that is also clearly perceptible to thepatient. (For specific questions of so-called ‘high-dose’ antipsychotic medica-tion see Thomson, 1994.)Dosage during Long-termTreatmentsBaldessarini and Davis (1980) attempted to clarify whether there is a significantrelationship between the antipsychotic maintenance dosages administered andthe risk of relapse in the case of chronic schizophrenics. Correlations calculatedfor 23 controlled studies showed no relationship between the administereddoses of antipsychotics and the risk of relapse within a wide range. Based onthis result, the authors ruled that the maintenance dosage for each individualpatient should be kept as low as possible in order to prevent antipsychoticsfrom causing undesirable delayed effects.Kane and Lieberman (1987) critically discussed the possibility of dosereduction during long-term treatments. From several controlled studies itclearly emerged that the reduction of an originally administered antipsychoticdose and the risk of relapse are closely correlated. On the other hand, patientson lower antipsychotic doses were described as less emotionally withdrawn,livelier, more relaxed and less sluggish. Because these patients also showedfewer signs of incipient tardive dyskinesia, Kane and Lieberman drew thefollowing conclusion: ‘‘Dosage reduction can lead to a diminution in adverseeffects and improvement in some subjective and objective measures ofwell-being; however, the risk of psychotic exacerbation increases, and patientsmust be observed carefully with a readiness to increase medication whenPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS265"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"necessary and usually on a temporary basis’’ (Kane and Lieberman, 1987,p. 1107).In a double-blind, multicenter, prospective study, Csernanskyet al. (2002)showed that among patients with clinically stable chronic schizophrenia orschizoaffective disorder the risk of relapse was significantly lower withrisperidone than with haloperidol (34% vs. 60%,P50.001). The means ofdaily doses of risperidone (\u00014.9 mg) and haloperidol (11.7 mg) were similar tothose used in clinical practice (Csernanskyet al., 2002). The reduced risk ofrelapse found with risperidone could be due to its superior efficacy, bettertolerability or both (Csernanskyet al., 2002).Duration ofTreatment and ComplianceIn discussions of the necessary and sensible duration of treatment ofschizophrenic patients with antipsychotics, two tendencies compete: the desireto keep each patient in hospital for as short a time as possible and to keepexposure to potentially harmful antipsychotics as short as possible; and theendeavour to avoid relapses and symptomatic deteriorations as far as possible.According to Heinrich (1976), the hospital treatment of productiveschizophrenic psychoses usually lasts about 6 weeks, sometimes less in thecase of catatonic syndromes and 2–4 months with schizophrenia simplex.Discharge from the hospital is striven for as early as possible so that the patientis less likely to become used to the protective atmosphere in hospital and sothat the family and other social contacts are not unnecessarily hindered. On theother hand, patients may be discharged only when their state has stabilized tothe extent that they are capable of coping with the stresses that willunavoidably occur on return into their usual environment. Each patientmust be prepared thoroughly for discharge: he must be made to understandclearly that he has to take his medication in the prescribed manner and mustlearn to recognize signs of deterioration in his state as being possiblepremonitions of a psychotic episode. Inner unrest, increased anxiety, sleepdisturbances, a dejected or irritable mood lasting over some period of time,prolonged tiredness and disturbed concentration are warning signs that shouldquickly bring the patient to the doctor’s surgery (Herz and Melville, 1980;Jorgensen, 1998), although psychotic episodes may also occur withoutidentifiable prodromal symptoms (Malla and Norman, 1994).A large percentage of patients take the antipsychotics prescribed for themeither irregularly or not at all. Precise figures are unknown but doubtless veryhigh and many relapses and readmissions to hospital for schizophrenics areattributed to ‘non-compliance’, i.e. to the failure to observe therapeuticinstructions. Revolving door psychiatry would thus seem to be partly due tothe patient’s rejection of treatment. One possible remedy is to prescribenotoriously unreliable patientsdepot antipsychotics, i.e. injectable galenic266PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"formulations of antipsychotics that are released over a period of weeks fromthe muscle tissue and then exert their therapeutic action. The most frequentcause of the failure to take medication as instructed – the often unsatisfactorytolerability of conventional antipsychotics arising particularly with highdoses – is, however, not eliminated by this procedure. Antipsychotics fre-quently lead to motor and vegetative disturbances (Chapter 1): tremor,stiffness, palpitations, outbreaks of sweating, impotence, dizziness and thetypical feeling of neuroleptic constraint are all phenomena that remind thedischarged patient that he is actually still sick and may cause him todiscontinue the orally administered medication on his own initiative.The intramuscular administration of antipsychotics acting for weeksprevents this independent action and improves compliance; on the otherhand, only highly potent antipsychotics such as fluphenazine, flupenthixol andhaloperidol are suitable for depot administration and it is precisely thesemedicines that lead more frequently to EPS and dysphoric mood (van Puttenetal., 1984).8.2.3 DISCONTINUATION TRIALS WITH ANTIPSYCHOTICSThe question of the optimal duration of antipsychotic treatment ofschizophrenic patients has been investigated in so-called discontinuation trials:depending on the study, the medicine that had been administered for months oryears was abruptly or gradually withdrawn and, in the better-controlledstudies, replaced by placebo. According to Gardos and Cole (1978) andWoggon (1979), who discussed the literature relating to older neuroleptics, themean relapse rate in schizophrenic patients 6 weeks after drug discontinuationis as high as 50%. Observations for 2 years show that chronic schizophrenicpatients who had been switched to placebo experienced a relevant deteriorationof their state 2.5–3 times more frequently than those patients who continued totake their original neuroleptic. Studies in which depot antipsychotics werediscontinued confirm these figures (Odejide and Aderounmu, 1982; Wistedtetal., 1982; Gilbertet al., 1995).The risk of relapse in discontinuation trials depends on many non-pharmacological, often poorly controllable factors, notably the expectationsof the patients, doctors and nurses, other environmental factors, the durationof hospitalization and prior treatment, and the time interval since the last acutepsychotic episode. On the basis of an analysis of 14 discontinuation trials,Kane and Lieberman (1987) found that the relapse rate varied greatly fromstudy to study: depending on the trial, relapse rates of 30–86% with clusteringaround 60–70% have been reported in the first 12 months after placebosubstitution. According to Kane and Lieberman, this scatter is a result of thedifferent inclusion criteria applied and the different definitions of ‘relapse’.PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS267"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"They therefore proposed that a quantifiable increase in symptoms be used asthe dependent variable instead of the relapse rate in future studies of this type.In a 2-year maintenance study by Schooleret al. (1997) 313 patients withschizophrenia who had been stabilized on depot fluphenazine were randomizedto one of three medication strategies using fluphenazine decanoate underdouble-blind conditions: continuous moderate dose (12.5–50 mg every 2 weeks);continuous low dose (2.5–10 mg every 2 weeks); or targeted, early intervention(fluphenazine only when symptomatic). Subjects were also randomized to oneof two family treatment strategies, supportive or applied. Both continuous low-dose and targeted treatment increased the use of rescue medication and relapsein comparison with a continuous moderate dose, with targeted treatmentincreasing the rehospitalization rate significantly; there were no significantdifferences between family treatments (Schooleret al., 1997). Overall, thisstudy clearly confirms the value of maintenance antipsychotic medication inthe prevention of relapse and rehospitalization.More important in practice than percentages would be an answer to thequestion of whether the relapse or exacerbation tendencies of individualpatients can be estimated on the basis of specific features evenbeforetheplanned withdrawal of antipsychotics. Unfortunately, the answer is largelynegative. According to present knowledge there are no reliable clinical featuresthat speak for or against the maintenance of antipsychotic therapy inindividual cases (Mo ̈ller, 1992).Consequently, in most cases the recommendation remains that the anti-psychotic treatment of schizophrenic patients should be continued for at least 12months after the termination of the acute episode and then, if this concerns thefirst psychotic episode and productive symptoms are no longer detectable, toreduce gradually and eventually discontinue the antipsychotic drug (Kissling,1991). Monthly check-ups by psychiatrists are necessary after this withdrawal ofmedication in order to recognize an impending relapse and to prevent it withinitially low doses of antipsychotics. In patients with frequent relapses,continuous treatment with antipsychotics is preferred and efforts should bedirected at finding the minimum dose that is still effective (Schooler, 1991). Otherfactors that are also decisive in individual cases include the patient’s relationshipwith the treating doctor, the attitude of the patient and relatives to the side effectsof antipsychotics and to the possibility of renewed hospitalization, and the easeof access to outpatient and inpatient psychiatric services.Prodromal signs of schizophrenia, such as sleep disturbance, agitation,preoccupation with odd ideas and disorganized thinking, may be recognized inat-risk populations and if treated could potentially lower the risk of developingfull-blown schizophrenia (Wyatt and Henter, 2001). Although it is still difficultto identify accurately all at-risk preschizophrenic patients, the consensusappears to be that early intervention with low-dose antipsychotics (preferablyatypical agents), stress reduction and psychosocial intervention may reduce268PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"both the risk and the severity of developing psychosis (Wyatt and Henter, 2001;Zipursky and Schulz, 2002).8.2.4 DRUG THERAPYAND PSYCHOTHERAPY OF SCHIZOPHRENIAThe introduction of antipsychotic drugs represented such a decisive advance inthe treatment of schizophrenia that the endeavors made in the 1940s and 1950sconcerning individual psychotherapy of schizophrenic patients were largelypushed into the background. Whereas older textbooks of psychiatry referrespectfully to the psychoanalytically orientated attempts at therapy forschizophrenics undertaken by Rosen and Benedetti, they generally qualify theirremarks by adding that the results of these often heroic efforts werequantitatively modest and that the wider application of such methods is outof the question on practical grounds. Over a period of 10 years a qualifiedtherapist could treat only 40–60 schizophrenic patients (Mu ̈ller, 1972).Early Comparative Studies: Psychotherapy vs. DrugTreatmentAccording to an often-cited review of studies provided by May (1968),antipsychotics represent considerably more effective treatment for acute formsof schizophrenia than do various types of psychotherapy:.Antipsychotics versus psychotherapy(two comparative studies). Both studiescovered large, statistically equivalent groups of patients with productivesymptoms: one study compared group psychotherapy and antipsychotics;the other compared analytically orientated individual therapy andantipsychotics. The results were similar inasmuch as both trials showedthe drug therapy to be markedly superior in almost all clinically relevantcharacteristics and symptoms..Antipsychotics versus combined antipsychotic therapy and psychotherapy(fivestudies). Here, too, the results were clearly in favor of drug therapy becausethere were virtually no relevant differences between patients receivingantipsychotics alone and those treated with antipsychotics plus psychother-apy. Three of the five studies involved group therapy and the other twoindividual psychotherapy: neither of these forms of psychosocial treatmentaugmented the effect of the simultaneously administered antipsychotics toany demonstrable extent..Psychotherapy versus combined psychotherapy and drug therapy(twostudies). In both studies the patients received analytically orientatedindividual therapies with the result that the effect of the combined therapieswas appreciably superior to that of psychotherapy alone. It was found inboth studies that the administration of drugs had no unfavorable effect onPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS269"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"the course of, or the results of, the psychotherapy that had been going onfor up to 2 years.The conclusion that May reached on the basis of this analysis was quite clear:‘‘...if onewere faced with the hypothetical choice of using one and only oneform of treatment in addition to the usual hospital care, the objective evidencewould indicate that, for the averagehospitalizedschizophrenic patient, drugtherapy would at present, generally speaking and on the average, be thetreatment of choice over other physical and non-physical forms of treatment’’(May, 1968, pp. 1170–1171). Interestingly, this statement also holds true for so-called environmental therapies, i.e. for occupational therapy, group activities,preparation for a profession, therapeutic community models, patient self-government and other hospital-run programs. In the opinion of May, eightadditional controlled trials clearly showed the superiority of antipsychotictherapy compared with such measures that, although somewhat increasing itsprospects of success, come nowhere near to taking the place of drug therapy.Two Long-term Studies from the 1970sMay’s survey related almost exclusively to studies with hospitalized patientswho, as experience shows, have quite variable outcomes: some of these patientswill stay in the protected environment of a clinic for a long time or evenpermanently, whereas the majority of schizophrenics can be discharged andperhaps will never return to the hospital again.One aspect of great importance in the long term, namely a reduction in therelapse riskafter the remission of an acute schizophrenic episode, forms thesubject of two comprehensive studies involving schizophrenic patients who hadbeen discharged from hospital (Hogarty and Goldberg, 1973; Mayet al., 1976);see Boxes 8.2 and 8.3.More Recent StudiesIn more recent studies, the therapeutic efforts have probably emphasized morethan before the individual requirements of the patients and their socialrelationships. As an example of a project directed to individual requirementsand thus ‘uncontrolled’ in various respects, a therapeutic study published byAlanenet al.(1986) in 100 schizophrenic patients in Turku, Finland, can becited. Three-quarters of these cases were hospitalized initially and almost allreceived antipsychotics, at least at the start of treatment, mostly in rather lowdoses. They were subsequently incorporated into various psychotherapeuticand sociotherapeutic programs that were greatly individualized and adapted tothe resources available in the participating institutions: intensive individual270PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Box 8.2 Pharmacotherapy and/or Psychotherapy in RemittedSchizophrenic PatientsIn a study conducted by Hogarty and Goldberg (1973), a sample of374 schizophrenic patients, who had been discharged after showingmarked improvement and had adjusted to ambulatory treatmentwith an antipsychotic for 2 months, was divided into four differenttreatment groups: chlorpromazine plus psychotherapy; placebo pluspsychotherapy; chlorpromazine alone; placebo alone.The psychotherapy consisted of regular individual sessionsdealing with the patient’s family as well as social and professionalproblems. With the number of relapses during the following 12months used as the criterion of therapeutic success, the results wereas follows:.chlorpromazine plus psychotherapy: 26% relapse.chlorpromazine without psychotherapy: 33% relapse.placebo plus psychotherapy: 63% relapse.placebo without psychotherapy: 73% relapseThese results unequivocally confirm the efficacy of antipsychotictherapy in preventing new schizophrenic episodes, whereas theprotective benefit of psychotherapeutic efforts was demonstrablebut quantitatively less impressive. A second evaluation after afurther 12 months, i.e. after a total follow-up of 2 years, confirmedthe first year’s findings: at this point in time considerably fewer ofthe patients being treated with antipsychotics had suffered a relapsein comparison with those treated with placebo and there wasfurther, albeit numerically less important, confirmation of theefficacy of psychotherapy. In a subsequent publication (Hogartyet al., 1976) the authors considered whether the effect of thepsychotherapeutic measures in the group receiving combinedtherapy was at best due to the fact that the respective patientstook their medication more regularly than did the remainingpatients, with the result that the presumed effect of thepsychotherapy was in reality a consequence of the more reliableintake of the medication. It emerged that there was no differencebetween the average daily doses prescribed for the groups and thatthe compliance reported by patients and relatives was more or lessthe same for both groups. The protective effect of the psycho-therapy was consequently deemed a real one and not merely theresult of a more regular intake of the medication.PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS271"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Box 8.3 Long-term Follow-up of Schizophrenic PatientsMayet al.(1976) published follow-up examinations over severalyears from a sample of 228 patients who had participated in acomparative treatment study in the 1960s. During their stay inhospital the patients (schizophrenics of both sexes hospitalized forthe first time) had received one of the following therapies accordingto a randomized experimental design:.analytically orientated individual psychotherapy.an antipsychotic (trifluoperazine).psychotherapy plus antipsychotics.electroshocks.environmental therapy, i.e. none of the four therapies namedAfter 3, 4 and 5 years the long-term effects of these treatments wereexamined. The criterion of success was taken to be the number ofdays spent by the patients in psychiatric hospitals since the firsthospitalization and since their discharge from first hospitalization.After 3 years, 203 patients could be followed up: the totalnumber of days spent in hospital in the case of the groups treatedwith psychotherapy and with environmental therapy alone wassignificantly greater than in the other three groups. The resultswere similar for the number of hospital days since discharge:patients on analytical psychotherapy had, on average, to berehospitalized more frequently and/or for longer periods than theother patients.After 4 years, when 113 patients could be examined, the resultwas about the same and a similar tendency was observed in 61patients 5 years after commencement of the study: in all cases thecatamnestic findings were least favorable for those patients treatedwith psychotherapy or environmental therapy.In this study, psychotherapy was clearly inferior to both drugtherapy and to electroshock treatment; the patients treated withpsychotherapy and environmental therapy were, on average,hospitalized for 50% longer than the other groups and, as notedby the authors, this clearly contradicts a popular prejudice againstantipsychotics: ‘‘it was simplynottrue that patients who had beeninitially treated with drugs relapsed more rapidly and spent moretime in hospital in the end than non-drug-treated patients. On thecontrary, the initial advantages of drug treatment seemed to persist272PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"for at least three years and, to a lesser extent, up to five years’’(Mayet al., 1976, p. 86).A critical remark that should be made in this context is that theauthors merely took as independent variables the treatmentsapplied at the time of first hospitalization, neglecting other factorsthat had arisen in subsequent years. If the patients really wereschizophrenics, it is almost certain that the majority of them wouldhave received further treatment that – contrary to the originalexperimental plan – could no longer be introduced in the sense of acontrolled trial. The results after 4 and 5 years must be regardedrather cautiously for this reason.psychotherapy, occasional psychotherapy of an essentially supportive nature,care in day clinics, family and husband/wife therapy, support in occupationalrehabilitation. Five years after the start of this program, more than half of allpatients and about one-third of the typical schizophrenics were asymptomatic,and clear psychotic features could be detected only in a minority. In manycases the antipsychotics had been discontinued without a relapse occurring, aresult that was particularly clear in those patients who had received occasionalor intensive individual psychotherapy. In all, the monograph by Alanenet al.provides a rather optimistic picture of the therapeutic outcome forschizophrenic patients.Schooler and Hogarty (1987) summarized a large proportion of the workspublished since 1978 in which drug treatment and psychotherapy orsociotherapy were combined, and drew the following conclusions with regardto the treatment of schizophrenia:.Individual psychotherapy. One controlled comparative study with fourtreatment groups (depot antipsychotics vs. orally administered antipsycho-tics, intensive vs. less intensive psychotherapy directed to interpersonalproblems) had been published. Marked differences could not be detectedbetween the four treatments during the course of 2 years, although thegroup given depot antipsychotics plus intensive psychotherapeutic caretended to do best: none of the patients in this group suffered further relapsesafter the first 8 months of study..Social and life skills training. The four available studies were of shortduration (5 days, 7 weeks, nine weeks, 12 weeks) and showed animprovement in the parameters of interest (eye contact, self-assertion).There was no detailed information on the antipsychotics administered and,according to the authors, it is also unclear how long the stated behavioralchanges lasted.PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS273"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":".Group psychotherapy. In this area there was a well-documented study byMalm (1982) in 80 recently hospitalized schizophrenics. All patients werereceiving depot antipsychotics and underwent a 3-month course to improvetheir social skills; half of the patients also participated in communication-orientated group therapy for 1 year; in this group there was an additionalimprovement in features relating to ability for emotional contact, generalwell-being, leisure activities and social contacts..Particularly interesting are treatment trials directed to therelatives ofschizophrenic patients,with the objective of modifying family dynamics.Four of the six studies cited by Schooler and Hogarty were based onthe concept of expressed emotions (EE), i.e. they started from theobservation that schizophrenic patients who return from the hospital tofamilies with markedly expressed feelings of criticism, hostility or evenexcessive care suffer relapses more frequently than others. In a study byLeffet al.(1982) it emerged that the relapse rate was reduced from50% to 9% within 9 months by eliminating or attenuating this behaviorof the relatives and the simultaneous administration of antipsychoticdrugs to patients.Mu ̈ller and Scho ̈neich (1992) also reported on favorable experience withintensive outpatient psychotherapy combined with antipsychotic drugtreatment. On the basis of a before-and-after comparison over 2\u00025 yearsin a university outpatient clinic, they were able to show that the durationof rehospitalizations required by 89 patients could be reduced from a mean of10 weeks to 2 weeks per year when a special schizophrenia outpatient serviceoffering individualized psychotherapy and psychosocial treatment was avail-able to the patients instead of the routine psychiatric outpatient service. Abeneficial effect of psychotherapy was demonstrated both in those patientstaking antipsychotics continuously for long-term prophylaxis and in thosetaking the drugs intermittently when prodromal symptoms appeared in orderto prevent relapse.The view of combined drug therapy and psychotherapy in schizophrenia hasthus changed fundamentally since May’s review (1968) classified psychother-apy as being of very little value. Whether given orally or in depot form,whether used for long-term maintenance or intermittently, antipsychotic drugsform the backbone of schizophrenia therapy but at the same time it is nowrecognized that individualized psychotherapy and psychosocial therapy ofhospitalized patients and especially of outpatients is essential because thesemeasures decisively improve the quality of life of patients and their families andhelp to prevent rehospitalizations and thus improve the long-term prognosis ofschizophrenic psychoses (see Sellwoodet al., 1994; Mojtabaiet al., 1998;Bustilloet al., 2001 for more references and a critical discussion of variouspsychosocial treatment models).274PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"8.3 ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND THE TREATMENT OFDEPRESSION8.3.1 TREATMENT OF DEPRESSIVE EPISODESThe drug therapy of depression differs in a number of critical points from thatgiven to schizophrenics. Depressions are phasically occurring deviations fromthe norm that, in the majority of cases, show spontaneous remission, althoughthis often may be only after a period of some months. The majority ofdepressives can be treated as outpatients – a fact that explains why the illnessgenerally does not make as severe an encroachment into the family and socialsurroundings of the patient as does schizophrenia. Outsiders are able toimagine what a depression must be like, or at least believe that they can:everyone is occasionally sad, disappointed or devoid of hope. In the eyes of hisfellow men and women a depressive consequently tends to be a person to bepitied but not one who is necessarily mad.The efficacy of antidepressants has been demonstrated statistically (Table 1.5in Chapter 1) and confirmed also in a meta-analysis of about 300 publishedclinical studies (Daviset al., 1993): a positive therapeutic result is to beexpected in almost two-thirds of cases with imipramine, amitriptyline,amoxapine and newer antidepressant drugs (Anderson, 2001), whereas agood one-third of all patients show a clinically relevant improvement withplacebo. According to Daviset al.(1993), these figures prove the therapeuticutility of antidepressants ‘‘beyond the shadow of a doubt’’ and also show thatthere are hardly any quantitative differences in efficacy between the varioussubstances licensed as antidepressants. But what is to be done with the 35% orso of patients who do not obtain a beneficial effect within 6 weeks ofmedication and who are thus ‘refractory to therapy’? Poor compliance must beassumed in some of these patients, perhaps as a result of side effects ofantidepressants, and in others the prescribed dose may be inadequate; both ofthese factors could be monitored by measuring drug levels in the plasma. In theother cases with ‘true refractoriness to treatment’, leading authors first advise achange of antidepressant, then combined drug therapy (Fatemiet al., 1999)and finally a change to other forms of treatment. Suitable staged plans orstrategies are reported by Janicaket al.(2001, chapter 7) and, more recently, bya Task Force of the World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry(Baueret al., 2002).None of today’s antidepressants are devoid of side effects, which, for theirown part, can intensify the feeling of illness and concern felt by the patient.Doctors consequently will not prescribe antidepressants unnecessarily,especially in older patients who react particularly sensitively to the centraland peripheral effects of these substances. Many doctors even seem to tend toinsufficient prescriptions: according to a survey reported by Kelleret al.(1982),PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS275"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"in the USA more than half of patients suffering from a depressive illness for atleast 1 month were either receiving no antidepressants or antidepressants ininsufficient doses. Two-thirds of these patients were receiving psychotherapyand more than half were taking anxiolytics, but only about one-third had beentreated with antidepressants for at least 4 weeks. Whether this situation was theconsequence of insufficient familiarity with the diagnosis and therapy ofdepression (as the authors of the study assume) or whether it reflected wiserestraint (Uhlenhuth, 1982) remained open. A more recent survey in the USA(Drusset al., 2000) supported earlier findings by Kelleret al.: in a nationalsample of 7589 young adults, 312 (4.1%) fullfilled DSM-III criteria for currentmajor depression, but only 7.4% of these were being treated with anantidepressant. Underreporting of depressive symptoms to health providers,mainly general practicioners, and limited access to general medical careappeared to be the main reasons for this situation. An earlier study fromSweden (Isacssonet al., 1992) showed the potentially tragic consequences ofinadequate antidepressant prescription. Of 80 representative suicide victimsselected in the period 1970–1984, at least 40 had consulted a doctor in the3 months before their death. Of these, 27 received a prescription forpsychopharmaceuticals, mostly anxiolytics or sleeping pills (i.e. the patientsmust have complained of mental symptoms), but an antidepressant wasprescribed in only eight cases. The authors of this study therefore saw a clearrelationship between inadequate psychopharmaceutical prescription andsuccessful suicide, and they demanded an improvement in the training ofgeneral practitioners with regard to psychiatric diagnosis and drug therapy.Treatment of Depression with Newer Generation AntidepressantsAlthough the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of unipolardepression is beyond reproach, the side-effect profile of these agents makesthem less desirable as first-line therapeutic agents. Introduction of selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline,citalopram and fluvoxamine in the past decade has revolutionized thetreatment of depression universally. The side-effect profile of SSRIs, such asnausea, diarrhea and sexual dysfunction, is considerably more benign than thatof tricyclic drugs. Multiple controlled trials have proven the efficacy of SSRIsvs. placebo (Nemeroff, 1994). Recently, a number of SNRIs (serotonin andnoradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) and so-called atypical antidepressants havebeen marketed that may have additional advantages over SSRIs, such as morerapid onset of action (venlafaxine, mirtazapine) and low sexual side-effectpotential (bupropion, nefazodone). Additionally, it appears that venlafaxinemay be more efficacious in cases of treatment-refractory depression (Clercetal., 1994; Fatemiet al., 1999). Finally, in a recent report (Thaseet al., 2001),276PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"venlafaxine was shown to be superior to SSRIs and placebo in attainingremission in depressed patients (Nemeroff and Schatzberg, 2002).8.3.2 PROBLEMS OF MAINTENANCE THERAPYAccording to modern treatment guidelines, episodes of endogenous depressionare treated with antidepressants for 6–12 months, both in hospital and athome. In cases of doubt the medication is given for a longer period because therestored subjective feeling of well-being does not necessarily reflect theabatement of a depressive episode and is often only the expression of transientsymptom suppression. Short-term prospects are good for the acutely depressivebecause remission occurs within 1 year in 85% of patients. In the medium andlong term the prognosis is less favorable: up to 65% of all patients receiving nofurther treatment suffer a relapse of greater or lesser severity within one year.About half of all depressives experience more than one severe depressiveepisode in the course of their lives and are thus at risk for years (Klerman andWeissman, 1992), and about 15% of all depressed patients commit suicide. Inview of the fact that depression is a recurring illness or even a chronic illness ina proportion of patients, the question of maintenance therapy arises in manycases.ContinuationTherapy of Depressive EpisodesControlled discontinuation trials show that about half of all depressive patientssuffer a serious relapse within 6 months if their antidepressant medication iswithdrawn shortly after the disappearance of acute symptoms; with continua-tion therapy, only about one-fifth of patients experience a relapse in the sameperiod. The difficulty for the treating doctor is to estimate reliably how long heshould continue to prescribe antidepressants for patients who have overcomedepression. Consensus groups suggest that this period should bebetween fourand six monthsafter the symptoms of depression have resolved (Montgomery,1997); even mild continuing symptoms may indicate that a depressive episodehas not ceased completely and that the treatment should be continued further(Lader, 2001).Because the continued symptoms of a treated episode cannot always beseparated from the prodromal symptoms of a subsequent episode (Fava andKellner, 1991), the continuation or rapid resumption of drug therapy isadvisable in all such cases. A prerequisite is close cooperation between doctors,patients and relatives so that symptoms are recognized early and reported, andthe necessary measures can be taken (CINP Task Force, 1993).PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS277"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"PreventiveTherapy (Secondary Prevention)Unipolar depressions occur more frequently than manic–depressive or bipolardisorder (see next section) and are etiologically heterogeneous. The question ofmaintenance therapy is consequently a complex one in such cases and someaspects are as yet unsolved. Lithium provides a certain amount of protectionagainst further episodes of unipolar endogenous depression but it is still unclearwhether depressive episodes can really be prevented or merely attenuatedsufficiently to prevent the need for hospitalization. Many clinicians regard theprotective effect of lithium in cases of unipolar depression to be too weak to meritits routine use. Instead, the long-term administration of antidepressants isfrequently recommended. Several studies have shown that these drugs not onlysuppress or curtail acute depressive phases but also can prevent the reappearanceof previously resolved episodes or, when administration is continued for years,the appearance of new episodes (Kupferet al., 1992).Chronic treatmentwithantidepressants is generally considered to be justified when episodes of depressionhave occurred at least twice in 5 years within the context of unipolar depression(CINP Task Force, 1993; Kennedyet al., 2002).8.3.3 TREATMENT OF BIPOLAR DISORDER WITH MOOD STABILIZERSSome 10–15% of all affective illnesses are manic–depressive or bipolar psychoses(ICD no. F31). Treatment of bipolar disorder may vary depending on thesymptoms of patients and whether they are acutely manic, depressed or mixed.The compilation and review of clinical reports is quite revealing regarding theefficacy of a number of medications in use in the USA, Europe and elsewhere.Treatments during Acute ManiaThe superiority of lithium over placebo has been shown in five controlled studies(see Keck and McElroy, 2002), which indicate that 70% of treated patientsexperiencing acute manic symptoms can obtain partial response. Lithium non-response as well as intolerance of lithium’s side effects provided the impetus to tryanumberofagentsthatmayhaveefficacyintheacutetreatmentofmania.Onesuch agent is valproic acid, which has been shown to exhibit a broad spectrum ofefficacy in acute mania. Eight controlled trials confirm that valproic acid iseffective in acute treatment of manic and mixed episodes and is comparable inefficacy to lithium and haloperidol in overall antimanic activity (Keck andMcElroy, 2002). Another anticonvulsant agent that possesses antimanic efficacy,is carbamazepine; numerous controlled studies have found this medication to beefficacious in the acute treatment of manic symptoms (Kecket al., 1992; Keckand McElroy 2002). Several antipsychotic agents also may exhibit antimanicactivity, e.g. olanzapine, chlorpromazine, risperidone and ziprasidone. Among278PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"these drugs, olanzapine has been shown to exhibit robust antimanic activity basedon double-blind, randomized controlled trials (Berket al., 1999; Tohenet al.,2001). This led to recent FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) approval ofolanzapine as an antimanic agent. Controlled studies indicate that lamotrigine, ananticonvulsant with GABAergic and Na channel stabilizing effects, may haveantimanic activity (Fryeet al., 2000; Ichimet al., 2000). Finally, two controlledstudies indicate that nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, may be effective inultrarapidly cycling manic patients (Pazzagliaet al., 1993, 1998; Keck andMcElroy 2002).Treatments during Acute Bipolar DepressionResults of crossover studies indicate that lithium is efficacious in treating acutedepression in bipolar subjects unequivocally (36%, 29/80) and partially (43%,34/80), respectively (Zomberg and Pope, 1993; Keck and McElroy, 2002).Various antidepressants have shown variable rates of efficacy in the treatment ofacute bipolar depression, i.e. desipramine (50%), maprotiline (67%), imipra-mine (40–60%), tranylcypromine (87%), moclobemide (53%) and fluoxetine(60%) (Keck and McElroy, 2002). Among the anticonvulsants, valproic acidand lamotrigine appear to have some potential efficacy in the treatment of acutebipolar depression (Calabreseet al., 1992, 1999; Fatemiet al., 1997).MaintenanceTreatments for Bipolar DisorderSeveral controlled trials have shown that lithium is efficacious in themaintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, with higher serum levels (0.8–1 mol/l) being more indicative of successful prophylaxis (Keck and McElroy,2002). Valproic acid also appears to have efficacy in maintenance therapy,specifically in bipolar patients with mixed mania and rapid cycling (Bowdenet al., 1995). The results concerning carbamazepine’s efficacy as a maintenancemedication are controversial (Stuppaecket al., 1994). Other potential agentswith some evidence of good maintenance value include clozapine andolanzapine. A combination of lithium and carbamazepine or other anti-convulsants is recommended under certain conditions if an adequate preventiveeffect cannot be obtained with the substances individually (Baueret al., 2002).8.3.4 DRUG THERAPYAND PSYCHOTHERAPY OF DEPRESSIONSNumerous investigations have been published concerning the question of thecontributions that psychotherapy and drug therapy can make to the treatmentof depressions, which psychotherapeutic procedures are particularly suitablefor depressions and whether combined drug therapy and psychotherapy issensible for depressions.PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS279"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Studies from the Early1970sThe first such investigation, the so-called Boston–New Haven Study, has beendescribed in several complementary individual reports (Klermanet al., 1974;Weissmanet al., 1974; Paykelet al., 1976). This started out with 150ambulatory female depressed patients and involved a comparison between sixforms of treatment:.For at least 1 h per week, 75 of the patients saw psychotherapeuticallytrained female social workers with whom they were able to discuss theproblems preoccupying them at the time. These therapies were supportiveand not primarily analytically orientated (high-contact group). Theremaining 75 patients saw a psychiatrist for about 15 min per month, toldhim how they felt and discussed any changes in the medication (low-contactgroup)..One-third of the patients in each of the two groups were then given anantidepressant (amitriptyline) in doses of 100–200 mg per day, one-thirdwere given placebo and the remaining one-third received no tablets at all.Cells were formed (Table 8.1) on the basis of this 2\u00023 design receivingdifferent forms of treatment. The patients (mean age 38 years) were sufferingfrom depressions of moderate severity, most of which were classified asneurotic, i.e. not endogenous. The women, usually from low- or middle-classbackgrounds, had been selected from an original sample of 278 depressivepatients, the selection criterion being a pronounced symptomatic improvementunder amitriptyline therapy within 4–6 weeks (Fig. 8.1). After 4 and 8 monthsthe patients were evaluated on the basis of the criteria of ‘relapse rate’ and‘social adjustment and satisfaction’: relapse was defined as the renewed returnof a depression rating score to the pretreatment level, and social adjustmentwas assessed on the basis of an extensive interview. Results were as follows:(1) At the end of the trial (6 months after randomization) the relapse rate inboth amitriptyline groups was450% lower than in the four non-druggroups. In the high-contact groups the relapse rate was some 25% lowerthan in the low-contact groups (this difference was not statisticallysignificant).

After 8 months, significantly better results were observed inthe high-contact groups than in the other patients, there being nodifference between those patients receiving medication and those receivingno medication.In the authors’ views drug therapy was clearly superior to psychotherapywith regard to the prevention of relapses, although social adjustment – andhence also long-term prognosis – was improved in those patients receivingpsychotherapy. It was striking to note the difference in the effect between thetwo forms of treatment over time: amitriptyline worked more rapidly andstrongly on the actual depressive symptoms, whereas psychotherapy actedmore slowly and on different mental aspects. The two therapies were additive,PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS281Figure 8.1Design of the study by Klermanet al.

The authors concluded:‘‘Psychotherapy is not an alternative to antidepressant treatment and does notprevent relapse or the recurrence of symptoms. Alternatively, continuedamitriptyline has no effect on social adjustment and is no better or worse than aplacebo or no pill’’ (Weissmanet al., 1974, p. 778).Several points need to be noted in the interpretation of this often-cited study.Firstly, the 150 female patients included in the study constituted a selection inthat they had responded favorably to amitriptyline given in a trial of severalweeks’ duration before the actual study, thus implying that drug treatment wasfavored from the outset. Secondly it was not the immediate, antidepressiveaction of the two modes of treatment that was compared, but their maintenanceeffect once symptomatic improvement had already occurred. The higherincidence of relapses in the groups receiving placebo or no medication thereforecould have been the result of the premature discontinuation of the medicamentto which the patients had responded favorably. It is consequently all the moreinteresting to note the effect, found as a trend but not statistically significant, ofpsychotherapy on the relapse rate. On the other hand, the improved socialadjustment in the groups receiving psychotherapy is not surprising: thesepatients had been treated for 6 months with a view to their social adjustmentand the resolution of interpersonal conflicts, and they evaluated themselves atthe end of the study; their hopes and expectations therefore must have spilledover into the assessments (Spitzer, 1976).Despite these limitations, the following conclusions can be drawn from theBoston–New Haven Study and two other, similarly extensive studies publishedat the same time – one with analytically orientated group therapy (Coviet al.,1974) and one with family therapy (Friedman, 1975):(1) The treatment of depressive patients using either drugs or psychotherapyappears to influence different symptoms or personality areas. Theantidepressants acted in particular on symptoms in the somatic, drive/motivation and mood sectors, with psychotherapy affecting more therelationship between the patients and their families and their widersurroundings.(2) Combined treatments had mainly additive effects. Patients being treatedpharmacologically and psychotherapeutically benefited in two ways. Therewas no evidence of a negative interaction between drug treatment andpsychotherapy.Both conclusions apply to outpatients with neurotic (i.e. rather lighter andgenerally non-endogenous) forms of depression. Two of the three investiga-tions dealt with maintenance therapy of patients who had already shownpronounced symptomatic improvement with antidepressant treatment.In the following studies, psychotherapeutic techniques were applied that hadbeen specifically developed for the treatment of depressions, namely cognitive282PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"therapy, interpersonal therapy and a behaviorally orientated technique knownas social skills training.Studies with CognitiveTherapyCognitive therapy (CT) is based on a theory developed by Beck (1991)according to which some typical symptoms of depression (despair, sadness,suicidal tendencies) reflect pathological changes in the cognitive organizationof an individual. Patients suffering from depression regard themselves, theirworld and the future in a negative light (¼depressive triad). Their distortedthinking is a result of logical and conceptual errors, including arbitraryconclusions, over-extensive and thus false generalizations and simplifications.The purpose of CT is to make the patients aware of their cognitive errors onthe basis of typical examples and, by means of specific training and guidance,to enable them to correct their false attitude. Cognitive therapy is sometimescombined with social skills training and is then called, by some authors,cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT).A trial carried out in Scotland (Blackburnet al., 1981; see Box 8.4)supported the use of CT in mild to moderately severe depression. In asubsequent study carried out by Becket al.(1985) in Philadelphia, theefficacy of CT alone was compared with that of CT plus drug treatment.Eighteen of the 33 outpatients (9 men, 24 women) with mild to moderatelysevere depression received a maximum of 2 h of CT in 12 weeks; 15patients also received CT with additional amitriptyline individually dosedwithin a range of 50–200 mg/day. At the end of treatment there were nosignificant differences between the two groups with regard to the various ratingscales, i.e. the antidepressant administered in addition to CT had neither abeneficial nor an adverse effect overall. A follow-up examination 12 monthslater showed a slight tendency in favor of the combined CT plus antidepressanttreatment.Murphyet al.(1984) could only partially confirm these results in a studyinvolving 87 depressive outpatients. Their mostly middle-class, predomi-nantly female and rather young patients with moderately severe to severedepression were allocated randomly to one of the following treatmentgroups:.CT: two sessions of 50 min per week for 8 weeks, then one session per weekfor 4 weeks.drug therapy: an individually adjusted dose of the antidepressant nortripty-line up to a previously established therapeutic window.CT plus drug therapyPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS283"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Box 8.4 Cognitive Therapy, Drug Treatment and their CombinationBlackburnet al. (1981) studied 49 patients with mild to moderatelysevere depressions in a psychiatric outpatient department and 39patients from a general practice in Edinburgh, i.e. a total of88 patients, of whom 64 (14 men, 50 women) completed the study.The patients were selected on the basis of the Research DiagnosticCriteria (Spitzeret al., 1978) as well as various rating and self-rating scales; one-third of the patients each received one of thefollowing, randomly allocated treatments for a maximum of 20weeks:.CT: 2 h per week for 3 weeks, then 1 h per week.drug therapy: generally amitriptyline or clomipramine at 150 mg/day.CT plus drug therapy: a combination of both proceduresPatients with a decrease in their symptoms by less than 50% after12 weeks were considered therapeutic failures. Major results of arather complex statistical evaluation were as follows:(1) Patients from both the psychiatric outpatient unit and fromgeneral practice showed the best results with combined CT anddrug therapy.(2) The poorest results in both subgroups were obtained with drugtherapy alone.(3) In the general practice patients, CT was significantly betterthan drug therapy.(4) Endogenous and non-endogenous depressives showed similarrates of success or failure with the three types of treatment.In all, this study suggested thesuitability of CT in mild tomoderately severe depressionsand tended to speak against the drugtreatment of patients whose mental illness is conditioned primarilyby their life situation. The study also confirmed that drug therapyand non-drug treatments can be combined in depressions..CT plus ‘active placebo’ (atropine and phenobarbitone in very small dosesto imitate the concomitant effects of the antidepressant)Seventy of 87 patients ended the study as intended, and most of the prematureterminations concerned patients given the antidepressant or CT plusantidepressant.

This means that all four treatments were approximately equallyeffective and that the combination of an antidepressant with CT provided noadditional benefit, unlike the observations of Blackburnet al.(1981). Also ofinterest are the results published by Simonset al.(1986) concerning a follow-upof these patients 12 months later: most relapses occurred in the group of patientstreated with drugs alone, whereas the patients treated with CT (with or withoutadditional antidepressant) showed relevant deterioration less frequently.In all, and despite the considerable differences between the cited studies,these results suggest that CT is an effective therapeutic procedure forambulatory patients with mild to moderately severe depressions. It alsoappears that CT and drug therapy may have similar efficacy in these cases,although the small numbers typical of these trials leave the possibility of type 2errors open. It remains to be determined whether a combination of CT with anantidepressant provides a significant additional benefit, and it is also unclearwhat the precise indications are for the two forms of therapy (see Hollonet al.,1991). Two more recent studies also have not provided definitive answers tothese questions:.In a multicenter study with exemplary methodology involving 250 patients,Elkinet al.(1989) found that drug therapy with imipramine, together withthe usual clinical care, tended to be more effective than 16 weeks oftreatment with CBT (one session per week) in patients with ‘majordepressive disorder’, and that CBT in turn had greater efficacy than placebotreatment plus the usual clinical care. Superiority of drug therapy over CBTwas particularly seen in severely ill patients. Re-analysis of the findings(Elkinet al., 1995) showed that all treatment modalities were similarlyeffective in milder cases, and that therapy with imipramine was significantlymore effective than CBT and the usual clinical care in more severe cases(patients with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores of520).Interpersonal therapy showed a slight advantage over CBT and the usualclinical care in the more severe cases..On the other hand, the results of a study by Hollonet al.(1992) suggestedthat 12 weeks of CT is as effective as the same duration of treatment withimipramine. In this comparison between CT, imipramine and a combinationof CT plus imipramine in 107 ambulatory depressives, the combinationtreatment tended to be superior to the two single therapies, but withoutachieving the threshold of statistical significance. The superiority of drugtherapy reported by Elkinet al.(1989, 1995) was thus not confirmed in thisstudy. However, the high dropout rate (about 40% of all patients) was anotable feature and affected all three treatment groups to roughly the samedegree.PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS285"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"In another study of interest in this connection, Mercieret al.(1992) noted thatthe majority of patients with so-called atypical depression not responding toCT did respond favorably to treatment with a monoamine oxidase (MAO)inhibitor or imipramine following CT. They concluded that both CT and drugtherapy can be considered effective treatments for different groups of depressedpatients and possibly have differential indications. However, the small numberof cases in this study does not allow a conclusion to be reached regardingpossible prognostic factors for successful therapy with CT or antidepressants.In a trial published by Scottet al. (2000) patients with residual symptoms ofmajor depression (n¼158) were randomized to receive clinical managementalone or clinical management plus 18 sessions of CT, and were followed for 16months. This study indicated that the addition of CT to pharmacotherapy mayproduce modest improvements in social and psychological functioning. Moreimportantly, there were also fewer relapses occurring in the patient groupreceiving CT in addition to clinical management.Studies with‘Interpersonal Therapy’The techniques of interpersonal therapy (IPT) developed by Klerman,Weissman and other authors are based on the concept that depressions havetheir origin in the area of interpersonal relationships and that they also runtheir course in that area (see Klermanet al., 1984). The purpose of IPT is torestore the patients within a short time to a position in which they can betterunderstand their interpersonal problems and are able to change theirunsatisfactory behavior towards others that leads to conflicts and frustrations.An early IPT study is presented in Box 8.5.Prusoffet al.(1980) and Klermanet al.(1982) analyzed the outcome of thisinvestigation in still another way by classifying the patients according to typesof depression. On the basis of Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzeret al.,1978) they formed several subgroups, the most important of which was a groupof endogenous depressive patients (n¼20) and a group of depressives whoseillness was labeled situative (n¼31). Situative depressions were diagnosed whenthe illness developed after an event or in a situation that probably contributedto the appearance of the depressive episode at that particular time. This led tothe following insights:.Endogenous depressives responded best to a combination of drug andpsychotherapy. Drug therapy alone was only marginally better than freeappointments. Psychotherapy alone was less effective than free appointments..In the case of situative depressives, psychotherapy and combined drug andpsychotherapy achieved approximately the same result and both weremarkedly better than drug therapy alone, which in turn was better than freeappointments.286PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"Box 8.5 Interpersonal Therapy, Drug Treatment and theirCombinationA first study with separate and combined use of IPT andantidepressants (Weissmanet al.1979) comprised 81 outpatients(12 men, 69 women) aged 18–65 years (mean approximately30 years) suffering from moderately severe unipolar depressionsand classified as neurotic depressions. Half of the patients receivedat least one session of 50 min of IPT per week for 16 weeks; theother patients were given the name and telephone number of apsychiatrist at the clinic and could call him whenever they wantedto make an appointment. They were granted a maximum of onetherapy session per month. Half of each of the two psychotherapygroups received amitriptyline in individually adjusted daily doses ofbetween 100 and 200 mg, or placebo.Clinical assessments were made by specialized raters notinvolved in the treatment after 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. Thestudy was intended to include 96 patients, 15 of whom withdrew atthe very beginning when they heard what treatment they were to begiven. Most of those withdrawing were in the psychotherapygroup. In addition, patients who failed to show any pronouncedimprovement in their symptoms within 8 weeks or whose conditioneven deteriorated were withdrawn from the study. In the case ofthose patients withdrawing from the study, scores recorded at thetime of withdrawal were used for purposes of evaluation; thisrepresents a last observation carried forward (LOCF) analysis.Withdrawals from the study occurred rather frequently andshowed the following distribution:Withdrewduring the%Withdrewfirst weekCompletedPsychotherapy group13/25848Drug therapy group16/24433Psychotherapy plus drugtherapy group8/24167Free appointments group16/23230Total53/961545According to this criterion, the combined therapy was superiorto the other three treatments, and drug therapy alone was littledifferent from the control conditions with free appointments.

The effect of psychotherapy on anxious and depressivemood was of rapid onset, whereas vegetative and somaticsymptoms showed little change. No negative interactions wereobserved between the two forms of therapy, the treatment effectsthus being differential and additive. The results indicated that drugtherapy was particularly suitable for those patients whosesymptoms were mainly vegetative–somatic in nature. Furthermore,the authors concluded from their findings that a patient rejectingone of the two forms of therapy (drug or psychotherapy) can beoffered the other form of therapy with good prospects of success.Viewed as a whole, this investigation supports the view that tricyclicantidepressants are particularly effective in cases of endogenous depression,whereas psychotherapy, possibly in conjunction with drug therapy, constitutesthe best solution in cases of situative depression (which would probably betermed reactive depression in the terminology used hitherto). It is interesting tonote that the combination of drug therapy with psychotherapy providedadditional benefit in patients with endogenous depression. It must, however, bestated that this final conclusion is only based on a fairly small subsample.In a large multicenter study published by Kelleret al. (2000), patients withchronic non-psychotic forms of depression (n¼681) were randomized to one ofthree groups: treatment with nefazodone; cognitive–behavioral analysis systemof psychotherapy; or combined treatment. Among the 519 patients whocompleted the study, 55% in the nefazodone group and 52% in thepsychotherapy group, as compared with 85% in the combined treatmentgroup (P50.001), responded favorably (with either a remission or a 50%improvement of their symptom scores) to the treatment modality. The rates ofwithdrawal were similar in the three groups, supporting the superiority ofcombined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment.Social SkillsTherapyThis behavior-orientated form of therapy is based on the assumption thatdepressions are attributable to the inability of patients to provide themselveswith positive ‘reinforcement’ through suitable modes of behavior (Kovacs,1980).

Social skills therapy or training (SST) attempts to overcomethe behavioral deficit and thereby to increase affectively satisfactory socialcontacts with family members, friends, colleagues and others.Bellacket al.(1981) reported on a comparative study involving 72 womenwith non-psychotic unipolar depression, of whom 60% came from apsychiatric outpatient clinic and 40% answered advertisements for treatmentin the press and radio. They were aged 20–60 years with a mean age of 36 years.The patients were divided into the following treatment groups at random:.Amitriptyline: the dose was increased from an initial 50 mg to 200 mg/daywithin 2 weeks. The patients saw their psychiatrist for 15–20 min each week,mainly to discuss the medication..SST plus placebo: the patients received 1 h of SST each week for 12 weekswith an experienced SST therapist. They also received placebo tablets..SST plus amitriptyline: in addition to SST, the patients received amitripty-line in individually adjusted doses..Psychotherapy plus placebo tablets: the patients in this group received 1 h ofindividual, generally psychodynamically orientated psychotherapy byexperienced psychotherapists each week for 12 weeks.The most striking result of this study was the high dropout rate in the twogroups treated with amitriptyline: more than 50% of these patients and almost30% of those receiving SST plus drug interrupted the treatment prematurely,whereas only 15% of the SST plus placebo group and 24% of thepsychotherapy plus placebo group dropped out. The patients remaining inthe study showed similar degrees of improvement in their symptoms after 12weeks. In the discussion of their results, the authors considered the possibilitythat the numerous dropouts in the amitriptyline groups resulted from therecruitment procedure and the disappointed expectations of the patients:presumably many of them had wanted a helper or ally and were disappointedwhen only medication and an occasional short interview were offered to them.Concluding Comments on DrugTherapy and Psychotherapyof DepressionsAs Weissmanet al.(1987) emphasized in a review some years ago, the utility ofseveral psychotherapeutic procedures in the treatment of unipolar non-psychotic depressions has been shown convincingly in a number ofindependent, controlled studies. Clearly structured procedures with time limits,such as CT, IPT and SST, represent valuable alternatives or a supplement todrug therapy with antidepressants, especially in outpatients. This view issupported by the large, carefully controlled study by Kelleret al. (2000, seeabove), which resulted in very similar response rates for drug treatment andPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS289"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"psychotherapeutic intervention.

Moreover, more patients dropped outof control conditions (54.4%) than of either treatment group.However, Meterissian and Bradwejn (1989) drew a rather differentconclusion after critical analysis of a large number of studies comparingdrug therapy and psychotherapy of depression. Although they did notgenerally question the value of non-drug procedures, they maintained that inmost comparisons the drug treatment was not applied with the same care andspecialist knowledge as used in the case of psychotherapy. Depending on thestudy, inadequate antidepressant doses were used, plasma levels of the drugwere not monitored or hardly any of the known methods for improving thetherapeutic success of drugs (change of drug, combination with lithium, etc.)were used. Because it is a matter of finding the specific indication for varioustreatments, these authors consider it essential to apply all the comparedprocedures optimally. It is obviously very demanding to compare psycho-therapy and drug therapy in a reliably blind and unbiased manner; accordingto Meterissian and Bradwejn, this requirement was not fullfilled in most of theavailable studies.Drug therapy with antidepressants usually cannot be dispensed with in thecase of hospitalized patients with severe depression. There have been onlysporadic controlled studies performed to determine whether psychotherapeuticmeasures provide a significant effect in these patients. To ̈lle (1985) emphasizedthe need for psychotherapeutic effort specifically in melancholic patients, whofrequently consider themselves not to require or not to be worthy of treatment.Although these patients often feel themselves to be lost, rejected and valueless,therapeutic attention can get through to them and give them the feeling thatthey are not entirely alone, given up by everybody and fully misunderstood. Astudy by Milleret al.(1989) in 45 hospitalized patients with mainly severedepressions seems to support this view: patients who had received CT or socialskills therapy in addition to drug therapy responded better to theantidepressant treatment and after 1 year also showed fewer relapses thanpatients who had received only antidepressants in addition to the usualhospital care.In conclusion, as summarized by Kupfer and Frank (2001), manyrandomized controlled trials have ‘‘established that pharmacological andpsychotherapy intervention provides excellent short-term benefit in terms of290PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"both reduced symptoms and suffering and improved functioning. . . treatmentusually is not complicated and can be administered by both psychiatrists andprimary care physicians.. . .

In the present connection we are concentrating on themost common uses of these drugs in psychiatry, i.e. on anxiety disorders.According to DSM-IV (APA 1994), these are:.Panic disorder with and without agoraphobia..Specific phobias..Social phobia..Obsessive–compulsive disorder..Post-traumatic stress disorder..Acute stress disorder..Generalized anxiety disorder..Substance-induced anxiety disorder, e.g. due to alcohol, opiate or sedativeabuse..Anxiety disorder due to general medical conditions, e.g. due to metabolic,infectious, immunological and various medical and neurological causes.8.4.1 TYPICAL INDICATIONS FOR ANXIOLYTICSAbout one-third of all adults suffer at some time in their lives from states ofanxiety and tension that can considerably impair their quality of life (Lader,1981). The majority of these individuals seek medical help sooner or later,about half of them within a year after the outbreak of the symptoms. Statisticsfrom the UK show that some 10% of these patients are referred to apsychiatrist. Psychiatrists consequently only see a small proportion of patientssuffering from states of anxiety, generally the rather severe, chronic, neurotic,perhaps socially decompensated cases. The remaining 90% of patients mostlyturn to their general practitioner; they are predominantly persons who react toburdensome circumstances with acute anxiety or stress symptoms. States ofthis nature are generally known to wane after some 6 weeks, although thisremission can be facilitated by taking a tranquillizer.PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS291"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Most of these patients’ disease states belong to DSM-IV categories such asacute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or generalizedanxiety disorder (GAD). Clinically, intensive or apparently exaggeratedanxiety and worries about the existing circumstances of life are mostprominent, and the patients often also have physically experienced tensionand stress, vegetative disturbances of all types, hypervigilance and irritability.These patients almost always respond rapidly to benzodiazepine agents withmarked improvement of symptoms (Shader and Greenblatt, 1993). However,long-term response can be obtained with SSRIs and serotonin–norepinephrinereuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as paroxetine, citalopram and venlafaxine.Panic disorders are sudden attacks of severe anxiety accompanied or evendominated by physical symptoms such as heart palpitations, difficulty inbreathing and a constrictive feeling in the chest, which can intensify the anxietyattack and put the subject in fear of his life. Panic attacks often arisespontaneously without detectable cause or are associated with particularsituations such as being in a crowd, in a small, enclosed space or on an exposedstreet. Both syndromes can be treated successfully with benzodiazepines.Alternatives to tranquillizers include certain antidepressants, e.g. SSRIs, andnon-drug therapeutic procedures (see below).Independently of these specific indications, the symptomatic efficacy oftranquillizers on mental and physical anxiety and tension symptoms has beendemonstrated in hundreds of individual investigations. According to a surveyby Freedman (1980), 80–90% of all controlled studies with tranquillizers showa clear superiority compared with placebo. The success rate appears to beindependent of the nature of the functional symptoms.8.4.2 ALTERNATIVES TO BENZODIAZEPINE ANXIOLYTICSBeta-receptor BlockersAn alternative to the use of benzodiazepine anxiolytics is the administration ofbeta-receptor blockers, generally called beta-blockers for short, to control thevegetative concomitant symptoms of anxiety and tension states (Kelly, 1980;Suzman, 1981). Affective arousal is accompanied by an increased release ofadrenaline and noradrenaline into the blood, which in turn produce physicalsigns such as palpitations, trembling, sweating and irregular breathing. Theseindividually variable vegetative changes are noticed by the subject and maypotentiate the excitement; they can thus become detached from their originalcause and become a problem as such. With beta-blockers, i.e. substances thatoccupy a subgroup of adrenergic receptors and protect them against the actionof released catecholamines, the vegetative arousal is reduced so that a state ofexcitement can lose much of its severity.292PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Experiments with ski jumpers and parachutists have shown that beta-blockers dampen the emotional tachycardia that arises before a jump. Publicspeakers and singers can overcome their stage fright during public appearancesby the use of these substances. Although vegetative symptoms of stress can beeliminated or attenuated with beta-blockers, mental clarity or artisticperformance are not adversely affected (Neftelet al., 1982). In controlledtrials, students with examination nerves achieved better results with beta-blockers than with diazepam and placebo because, although they still felt themental tension of the examination, they were not additionally disturbed bypalpitations, tremor and other symptoms. Beta-blockers are generally welltolerated, but contraindications include asthma, bronchospasm and certaincardiac arrhythmias.Benzodiazepines, Antidepressants and OtherAgentsTreatment of GAD can be undertaken using a number of pharmacologicalagents. Benzodiazepines have been found to be superior to placebo in severalstudies and all benzodiazepines appear to be equally effective. However, sideeffects include sedation, psychomotor impairment, amnesia and tolerance(Chapter 1). Recent clinical data indicate that SSRIs and SNRIs are effective inthe treatment of acute GAD symptoms. Venlafaxine, paroxetine andimipramine have been shown to be effective antianxiety medications inplacebo-controlled studies. Case studies also indicate the usefulness ofclomipramine, nefazodone, mirtazapine, fluoxetine and fluvoxamine in GAD.Buspirone, a 5-HT1a receptor partial agonist, has been shown to be effective inseveral placebo-controlled, double-blind trials (Roy-Byrne and Cowley, 2002).Buspirone has a later onset of action than both benzodiazepines and SSRIs butwith the advantage of being non-addictive and non-sedating.A larger set of placebo-controlled studies show conclusively that imipramineis also effective for the treatment of panic disorders. Other agents shown to beeffective in panic disorders include the SSRIs paroxetine, sertraline,fluvoxamine, fluoxetine and citalopram. Generally, initial treatment ofmoderate to severe panic disorders may require the initiation of a short courseof benzodiazepines e.g. clonazepam (0.5–1 mg twice daily), and an SSRI. Thepatient will obtain immediate relief from panic attacks with the benzodiazepinewhereas the SSRI may take 1–6 weeks to become effective. Once a patient isrelieved of initial panic attacks, clonazepam should be tapered anddiscontinued over several weeks and SSRI therapy continued thereafter.There are no pharmacological treatments available for specific phobias,however controlled trials have shown efficacy for several agents, e.g.phenelzine, moclobemide, clonazepam, alprazolam, fluvoxamine, sertralineand paroxetine in the treatment of social phobia (Roy-Byrne and Cowley,2002).PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS293"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Psychotherapy and/or DrugTherapy?According to older surveys by Luborskyet al.(1975) and Freedman (1980),drug treatments with anxiolytics are more effective overall than psychotherapyin anxiety and tension states. However, the comparative studies consideredhere were mostly of short duration and thereby favored the drug therapy. It isalso interesting that combined drug therapy and psychotherapy in these olderstudies usually produced higher success rates than treatment with anxiolyticsalone, and that there were no reports of adverse interactions, e.g. no adverseeffect of drug therapy on the psychotherapeutic process. An analysis by Wardle(1990), which was directed particularly to the question of whether benzo-diazepines could have an adverse effect on the results of behavioral therapy(e.g. as a result of state-dependent learning within the context of flooding orexposure techniques), came to a very similar conclusion as the older authors. Infour of six studies considered, the results with combined behavioral andanxiolytic treatment were better than with behavioral therapy alone, in onestudy there was no difference and in only one study (in which barbiturateinfusions had been used, not an anxiolytic) was there evidence of a superioraction of behavioral therapy without concomitant drug therapy.In the meantime, both the psychotherapeutic approaches and the possibledrug therapies for the treatment of anxiety and obsessional syndromes havebeen refined and several models were developed for the interplay of the twoapproaches that initially appeared so different (see Hersen, 1986; Coryell andWinokur, 1991). A review of several meta-analyses of non-drug treatmentstudies shows that in many indications, including the anxiety syndromes ofinterest here, psychotherapeutic procedures of various types can be expected toproduce therapeutic effects of the same magnitude as with psychopharmaceu-ticals (Lipsey and Wilson, 1993). Behavioral therapy, cognitively orientatedtherapies and many combinations and variants of these procedures producesatisfactory results that open up alternatives to drug therapy for patients andtheir doctors or psychotherapists (see also Gelernteret al., 1991; Coxet al.,1993).A study by Welkowitzet al.(1991) shows that positive therapeutic resultswith non-drug procedures can also be obtained in institutions and by therapistswho initially are less familiar with psychotherapeutic techniques. In apsychiatric center traditionally orientated towards drug therapy in NewYork, several psychiatrists, nurses and psychologists were introduced to acognitively orientated behavioral therapy (CBT) technique on the basis ofinstruction books and videotapes and then treated a group of 24 patients withpanic disorders. These were patients, mainly women, who had previouslyresponded insufficiently to drugs or who desired a non-drug therapy. Afterconcluding the program of 12 sessions that were highly structured in time andcontent, 14 of the 24 patients were assessed as being asymptomatic and another294PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"three had far fewer panic attacks than before, or even none at all. As theauthors admit, the favorable therapeutic result may be attributable partly tothe positive motivation of the ‘experimental therapists’ and the special selectionof patients, but the study also shows that non-drug methods of treatment canbe learned quickly and practiced successfully in indications for whichanxiolytics conventionally tend to be used.In contrast to some of the above, a review and critical analysis by Westraand Stewart (1998), who compared the effects of CBT and pharmacotherapyand of combining both in anxiety disorders, concluded that these twotreatment modalities often fail to operate in a complementary fashion.According to the authors, high-potency anxiolytics (e.g. alprazolam) mayactually impact negatively on the effects of CBT, whereas low-potencybenzodiazepines such as diazepam and antidepressants generally have anegligible effect, i.e. no clear enhancement of CBT effects in patients. Althoughit is conceded that short-term use of anxiolytic drugs is likely to producesymptomatic relief, the durability of treatment gains with these drugs is said tobe doubtful, as manifested by the reappearance of symptoms after drugdiscontinuation. Westra and Stewart discuss several hypothetical mechanismsunderlying the pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment approachesand their differential effects in anxiety disorders; they also provide somepractical suggestions as to how patients’ expectations from drug treatment andits eventual discontinuation should be managed.8.4.3 RECOMMENDED TREATMENTSIt is generally recommended that benzodiazepine anxiolytics be prescribed fornot more than 6–12 weeks for states of anxiety, unrest and tension not arisingwithin the context of psychosis (Rickels and Schweizer, 1987). One advantageof these drugs is their rapid onset of action. On the other hand, alternativedrugs (Ninanet al., 1998) or a non-drug treatment should be introducedwhenever possible in the case of more prolonged disturbances. Practically allleading authors stress the need to adapt drug therapy, psychotherapy andcombined therapies to match the individual symptoms and requirements ofeach patient and not to approach the individual case with a predeterminedregimen (Roy-Byrneet al., 1993b). Nevertheless, some general recommenda-tions shown in Table 8.2, based on a scheme by Freedman (1980), can be given.8.5 PSYCHOSTIMULANTS AND THE TREATMENT OFATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDERThe most important clinical use of amphetamine-like stimulants is for attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Methylphenidate, the drugPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS295"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"most prescribed today in ADHD, leads to a significant improvement ofsymptoms in about 70% of cases, whereas 20–30% of children show nosignificant change on psychostimulants or may even deteriorate on these drugs.Several slow-release forms of methylphenidate and of mixed amphetamines arecurrently available; these preparations allow once-a-day drug administrationand thus avoid the embarassment and risks involved if stimulant medicationhas to be handed out by a nurse to the child at school or carried by the childwhile away from home. Caffeine, a psychostimulant with a mechanism ofaction different from that of amphetamines, has no beneficial effect in ADHD.8.5.1 QUESTIONS OF LONG-TERM MEDICATIONBecause ADHD represents a severe disorder usually lasting for years, in manycases well into adulthood (Faraoneet al., 2000) and making prolongedtreatment necessary, questions arise about the long-term action and safety ofpsychostimulants used in this indication. The therapeutic action of ampheta-mines and methylphenidate is thought to be maintained for years in the vastmajority of patients, and there is no need to increase the dose to a relevantdegree (Safer and Allen, 1989). Controlled studies reported in Chapter 7(Gilberget al., 1997; MTA Cooperative Group 1999) confirm that stimulantdrugs maintain their efficacy well beyond 1 year of treatment. Discontinuationstudies have shown that a proportion of children can do without psychosti-mulants temporarily or entirely. Because of this, it is advisable to withdraw the296PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 8. 2Preferred forms of therapy for anxiety syndromes (the individual therapymust be guided by the symptoms and responses of the patient, as well as the meansavailable in practice)Severity of physical symptomsSevereMildSyndromes with strong‘cognitive’ componentPanic disorderCombination of low-doseanxiolytic such asclonazepam with SSRI orSNRI initially (1–2months) and later SSRI orSNRI onlyGeneralized anxiety disorderSSRI, SNRI or low-doseanxiolytic or buspironePsychotherapy if indicatedSyndromes with weak‘cognitive’ componentSocial phobiaSSRI or beta-blocker(propranolol) or anxiolyticor psychotherapyTransient states of unrestAdvice, calming"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"medication from time to time so that the patient does not continue to take aproduct that is no longer effective or no longer necessary (Dulcan, 1997).Amphetamines and methylphenidate inhibit appetite and modify variousendocrine processes, so that the question arises as to whether the physicaldevelopment and growth of patients treated long term with these drugs will runa normal course. Children undergoing long-term treatment with methylphe-nidate grow somewhat slower but make up the deficit during adolescence andachieve normal stature in adulthood. As Gittelman Klein (1987) commented,this observation applies to children whose treatment was discontinued duringadolescence.There have been only a few studies dealing with the question of the positivelong-term impact of stimulants in ADHD. After weighing up the availableclinical evidence, Gittelman Klein (1987) concluded that treatment withpsychostimulants is certainly effective during prolonged periods of time, but itcannot be said with certainty whether the ultimate outcome is modified to asignificant degree. This rather cautious evaluation contrasts with some positiveresults of long-term observations of drug-treated ADHD children as publishedby Weiss and Hechtman (1986).8.5.2 DRUG THERAPYAND PSYCHOTHERAPY OF ADHDIn her review, Gittelman Klein (1987) considered nine studies publishedbetween 1977 and 1985 dealing with combined drug therapy and psycho-therapy of ADHD children. The non-drug treatments included cognitivetraining (five studies), various forms of behavioral therapy (five studies) andparent training (one study), and more than one method was used in somestudies. The results are unanimous and surprising in that not one of the studiesshowed a clearly detectable advantage of combined treatment over drugtherapy with stimulants alone in everyday or school behavior.This conclusion stands in contrast to the statements made in an earlierreview (Kauffmann and Hallahan, 1979) that behavioral therapeutic techni-ques have an important role to play in ADHD, and partly contradicts theresults of some more recent studies. As summarized in Chapter 7 (p. 250 f.), theUS MTA study did not detect any significant difference between combinedtreatments and treatment with methylphenidate alone with regard to theireffects on ADHD symptoms; however combined treatments had someadvantage over drug alone on features such as anxiety disorders, social skills,consumer (mainly parent) satisfaction and possibly academic achievement(Pelhamet al., 2000). Additional statistical analysis of the MTA study byresponders and in terms of composite outcome measures also revealedadditional benefit of combined treatments over drug therapy alone (Jensenet al., 2001).PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS297"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"8.6 CONCLUDING COMMENTSAn attempt has been made to discuss the position of drug therapy of varioustypes of mental disorders within a wider perspective, and especially to clarifythe relationship between drug therapy and non-drug treatments. It wasnecessary to deal separately with the various classes of psychopharmaceuticalsand the disorders treated with them, and for our purposes it was also sensibleto refer as far as possible to controlled, i.e. comparative, studies. The drawbackof this ‘evidence-based’ approach is obvious: comparative studies oftherapeutic procedures almost necessarily favor one of the comparedtreatments because they can never be carried out with completely identicalpreconditions for all treatments (Elkinet al., 1988). Indeed, as discussed byKlein (2000), various meta-analytical studies comparing psychotherapy withpharmacotherapy were scrutinized and discovered to include studies that werenot entirely blind, random, controlled or of high quality, leading to inaccurateconclusions. Thus, meta-analyses based on flawed studies are clearlyinadequate for the establishment of treatment guidelines (Klein, 2000). Onthe other hand, the value of an admittedly incomplete summary such aspresented here is that results obtained in different places by different authorswith different preconditions can be critically compared and related one to theother.As Karasu (1982) has stated some time ago, the relative positions of drugtherapy and psychotherapy have changed several times over recent decades. Inthe 1950s most psychiatrists and psychotherapists were chiefly interested inpsychoanalytically orientated psychotherapy of predominantly neuroticdisorders. ‘‘Drug treatment was considered as inhibitory or, at best,superfluous.’’ Some of the critical arguments represented in the upper-rightpanel of Fig. 8.2 therefore derive from this period. Over the following decadeneuroleptics became established as the therapy of choice for schizophrenicpsychoses, whereas psychotherapy, mainly in the form of group therapy orsocial measures, initially proved to be a not very effective adjuvant in thesepatients. A certain arrogance on the part of drug therapists, expressed bystatements such as those in the lower-right panel of Fig. 8.2, also derived fromthat period. During the 1970s the advantages of a combined approach totherapy were recognized, initially in the treatment of affective disorders, andthoughts of synergistic effects arose, at least for some indications. This positiveaspect is summarized on the left-hand side of Fig. 8.2, even though it isaccepted that additive or even supra-additive actions of drug therapy andpsychotherapy have not been demonstrated in all indications.In the course of the treatment of schizophrenia, depressive and variousanxiety syndromes, it has been found repeatedly that psychopharmaceuticalsand psychotherapies are likely to modify different types of symptoms and298PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"PSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALS AND MENTAL DISORDERS299Figure 8.2Arguments for and against combined drug therapy and psychotherapy (Pfefferbaum,1977;Weissman,1978; Karasu,1982)"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"stages of illness, which in fact could – to simplify matters very considerablyand possibly overoptimistically – pave the way to the more efficient use oftherapy. Of practical significance is a statement made by DiMascioet al.(1979)and echoed by more recent authors (e.g. Kupfer and Frank, 2001) that, in thecourse of the treatment of depression, patients having different expectationsand practical possibilities of therapycan today be offered various forms oftreatment with good prospects of success, without the therapist having to workwithin the framework of a specific psychotherapeutic or pharmacotherapeuticschool of thought.Have all the fears and critical questions raised at the beginning of thischapter been reassuringly and satisfactorily answered? Within the scope ofempirical and quantitatively orientated studies the answer is presumably yes –but it is not possible to go any further. Some of the negative interactionssketched in Fig. 8.2 originate from practical experience, i.e. from therapeuticfailures incurred by many doctors and psychotherapists (see Westra andStewart, 1998). They can, however, be exemplified only by means of aqualitative analysis of individual cases and are lost in the global success figurestypical for large comparative investigations. In other words, even if the left-hand side of Fig. 8.2 appears to be largely supported by the statistical data putforward, this does not definitively refute the right-hand side thereof.Psychopharmaceuticals can – if used incorrectly or at the wrong moment (orif not used at all!) – impede or wreck the psychotherapeutic process, and thesame applies to psychotherapeutic intervention introduced at the wrongmoment or in a substantially incorrect manner in the context of psychophar-macotherapies. Although the possible synergy between the two forms oftherapy, which has been demonstrated in several indications, does increase theprospects of success from a statistical point of view, it is by no means aguarantee of success in the individual case.300PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"9Psychopharmacology and HealthEconomicsByED SNYDER9.1 INTRODUCTIONToday the cost of healthcare is higher than ever before and, in most of theworld’s economies, rising faster than any other sector. These rising costs areabsorbing a rapidly growing share of nations’ economic resources. Part of thetask of healthcare policy-makers, who are responsible for the management ofthe healthcare system, is to encourage the use of cost-effective therapies andlimit the use of those therapies that are not as cost-effective as theiralternatives. The field of health economics uses economic techniques todemonstrate the value of various therapeutic approaches available inhealthcare. Several introductory texts are available that present the basics ofan economic evaluation of healthcare, such as those by Drummondet al.(1997) and Goldet al.(1996). In recent years the level of sophistication in usingsuch economic techniques has evolved to the extent that there are now distinctsubfields in health economics. When these economic techniques are used todemonstrate the value of pharmaceuticals, for example, the field is referred toas pharmacoeconomics.The demonstration of the value of pharmaceuticals, such as psychopharma-ceuticals, always involves a comparative analysis of alternative courses ofaction, such as the use of two psychopharmaceuticals or the use of apsychopharmaceutical and psychotherapy, or one of the courses of action canPsychopharmacology, Fourth Edition.

The difference in the cost of the twoalternatives is then compared with their relative effectiveness. The effectivenessof the therapies may incorporate clinical as well as patient-reported outcomes,such as the quality of life of the patient receiving the therapy.The demonstration of the value of a pharmaceutical is part of a largerprocess of demonstrating the efficacy, safety, quality of manufacture and cost-effectiveness of the drug. Establishing the efficacy, safety and quality ofmanufacture of a drug is the traditional method of screening new therapies byhealth policy-makers, such as national health authorities, but in recent yearshealth policy-makers in many countries have also requested a demonstration ofthe value of a drug’s effectiveness, its impact on the quality of life of thepatients and the effect on the healthcare system’s budget. This is the role ofpharmacoeconomics. Even for a drug of proven efficacy, healthcare policy-makers may require a demonstration of the impact of the drug on thehealthcare system budget if, for example, the disease for which it is used has ahigh prevalence or because the disease is chronic in nature and treatment isexpected to last for a long time. In many healthcare markets, this highprevalence or chronic nature of the disease combined with the cost of a givendrug may affect the system’s budget in such a way as to drain it of resourcesthat could be used to treat other conditions. The demonstration of the impactof the cost of the drug on the healthcare system budget also considers thecurrent costs incurred by the healthcare system in treating the disease withcurrent therapies, and how those costs may be lowered or raised by the use ofthis new therapy. In most healthcare systems, these concerns can be addressedby the demonstration of the economic and quality-of-life impact of the drug.9.2 PHARMACOECONOMICS DEMONSTRATES A DRUG’SVALUEPharmacoeconomics demonstrates a drug’s value to the patient, policy-makerand society. The purpose of pharmacoeconomics is to demonstrate a drug’seffect on the quality of life of the patient, as well as the drug’s economic effecton the healthcare systems, the effect on payors (such as managed-careorganizations or health insurance groups who usually pay the direct medicalcosts) and the effect on patients and caregivers (who are mostly interested inthe out-of-pocket costs, or the hours of caregiving required).Today’s healthcare policy-makers, including government officials, healthinsurance companies and managed-care organizations, are faced with thereality of limited resources for healthcare and the knowledge that muchmedical care is of uncertain value. The value of vitamin E therapy inAlzheimer’s disease, for example, is still unclear, but some physicians haverecommended it for years without any real measures of its effect on the disease.302PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"There is also evidence that there is significant variation in medical practicepatterns both between and within countries. Research by Wennberg (1984)found a high variation in the use of medical procedures for specific conditionsin the USA that were not explained by population morbidity or mortalityfigures.These realities of the current state of healthcare have caused healthcarepolicy-makers to use several methods to regulate the supply and demand ofhealth services and thereby control the cost of those services. Attempts toreduce the supply of services include a reduction in the reimbursement forservices or a reduction in the number of physicians and specialists. Theseapproaches may contain the growth of healthcare costs but a reduction in thecapacity of the healthcare system also limits the patient access to services,resulting in longer waits for non-emergency services. Attempts to reduce thedemand for services include:.Raising barriers to the access of services. Such barriers may includepaperwork and approval processes that discourage providers and patientsfrom seeking the service..Delays to the entry of services into the healthcare system, such as a separateapproval process for the reimbursement of a pharmaceutical by thehealthcare system after the approval of the safety, efficacy and quality ofmanufacture.Therefore, when new psychopharmaceuticals are developed the demonstrationof their value to both the patient and the healthcare system is essential toensure that patients have practical access to the therapy. Clinical efficacyevaluations (Chapter 5) demonstrate clinical effects to such health authoritiesas the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA, and the EuropeanMedicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA) in Europe. After the clinical effect hasbeen established, the pharmacoeconomic evaluation demonstrates the value ofthe clinical effect to country-specific reimbursement bodies that are responsiblefor supporting the healthcare budget. These include the National Institute forClinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK and Pharmacy and TherapeuticsCommittees (P&T Committees) for managed-care organizations in the USA.Most European countries have healthcare policy bodies that review thisevidence too. The purpose of these reviews is to determine the impact on thehealthcare budget when the use of the drug or device is paid from the budget.These bodies conduct economic evaluations to determine the value of theclinical effect and review the evidence produced by academics and pharma-ceutical companies. Both the cost of the therapy and the effectiveness of thetherapy determine the value of a drug or device. The costs of the therapyinclude the cost of the drug, the cost of administration, the cost of managingside effects and the cost of switching therapies.

One analysis can vary considerably from the next, depending on thecosts and outcomes included in the analysis. The outcome of the therapy on thepatient’s quality of life or the costs of the therapy in terms of the number ofhours of a caregiver’s time consumed with patient care will be given differentweight depending on the perspective from which the analysis is done. Thepayor (or the body responsible for managing the healthcare budget) may not beinterested in some of the specific effects of the therapy, such as the number ofhours of patient care that will be required by family and friends. Payors may beinterested only in the costs that directly affect their budgets and not the largereconomic issues for which they are not directly responsible. For example,managed-care organizations in the USA are responsible for the costs directlyassociated with the delivery of healthcare but not for covering the cost of anincrease or decrease in the number of hours a spouse caregiver must spend incaring for the patient.In contrast, the patient and the patient’s family may be very interested in theoutcome that this therapy has on the caregiving burden; on the other hand,they may not be interested in the direct costs of the therapy for which they arenot directly responsible. Most national regulatory bodies, such as the NICE inthe UK, prefer a comprehensive, societal perspective on a drug’s value becausesuch a perspective incorporates all these variables. This broader perspectiveexamines direct costs, caregiving costs and indirect costs.The costs associated with the treatment of a disease are categorized as directcosts and indirect costs. Those who are responsible for the payment ofhealthcare services are usually most interested indirect costs, or costs that areincurred directly as a result of the care of the patient’s condition. These costsinclude hospitalization, physician visits, drugs, laboratory tests and proce-dures. They also include the treatment of drug-related side effects, thetreatment of unfavorable drug–drug interactions and the costs of switchingfrom the current therapy to a new therapy. Direct costs may also includesavings due to costs that are avoided: inpatient days, outpatient visits,procedures and laboratory tests that do not occur.Those not formally employed, such as a spouse caregiver, also incur costs inthe care of a patient at home. This is called ‘informal’ caregiving because it isusually provided free of charge by a family member or friend. Thecosts ofinformal caregivinginclude expenditures incurred to accommodate the patient’s304PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"current condition at home, including modifications to the home, such as theinstallation of wheelchair ramps, the widening of doorways, changes inplumbing and bathroom fixtures and the purchase of special furniture, such asa hospital bed, and medical equipment. The hours of care provided by thecaregiver also may be used to estimate the value of the costs of this informalcaregiving. Some researchers calculate the cost of these hours of care by usingthe hourly rate of a professional caregiver performing similar tasks, whereasothers measure the opportunity costs of a caregiver whose hours are nowdevoted to caring for the patient. Opportunity costs are determined by thewages given up by the caregiver to care for the patient, or the value of leisuretime forgone because of the care that is necessary for the patient. In economicanalysis, the cost of informal caregiving is usually reported separately becausepayors and policy-makers are not particularly interested in these kinds of costs.The cost of informal caregiving is considered relevant for government policy-makers and others who adapt a societal perspective on the economic analysis,as well as, of course, the patients and caregivers.Indirect costs, sometimes called productivity costs, are incurred as aconsequence of the patient’s condition and the patient’s experience of thecondition and not as a direct result of the treatment of the patient’s condition.For those gainfully employed, this includes disability, absenteeism and lostproductivity. These measures are quantifiable and the total indirect costs canbe a substantial portion of the total societal costs of the treatment of thepatient’s condition. For example, the costs of schizophrenia in Canada are overCan$2.3 billion in direct healthcare costs and an additional Can$2 billion inindirect costs annually (Procyshynet al., 2000). The societal cost of the diseaseis almost as much as the direct cost of treating the disease.9.2.2 QUALITY OF LIFE AS AN OUTCOME INPHARMACOECONOMIC ANALYSISBecause the principal focus of pharmacoeconomics is to incorporate outcomesin the demonstration of the value of a therapy, the quality of life that resultsfrom a therapy has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Mostfrequently, quality of life is measured using standardized instruments to collectpatient-reported quality of life. These instruments are traditionally developedusing patient or expert interviews to establish the areas of inquiry or ‘domains’of the instrument. The use of these instruments in pharmacoeconomics isheavily dependent on the demonstrated psychometric properties of theinstrument, such as its reliability, validity and responsiveness, or on sensitivityto the changes in the disease to be studied.A psychopharmaceutical can be safe and efficacious when used in a clinicaltrial but what is its effectiveness when it is used in real life conditions? If aPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND HEALTH ECONOMICS305"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"patient has a bad experience with a drug, there is likelihood that persistencyand compliance with the therapeutic regimen will be compromised. This, ofcourse, makes the drug less effective than originally estimated. For example,patient assessments of their quality of life are directly related to the therapeuticcompliance that is to be expected. In cases for which antipsychotic medicationswith extrapyramidal symptoms and poor control of negative symptoms andother serious side effects result in impaired quality of life, poor adherence withthe medication regimen may result. Measuring the subjective experiences ofpatients with schizophrenia along with clinical endpoints provides acomprehensive picture of both the impact of the condition and the impact ofits treatment (Awadet al., 1995).Therefore, an economic analysis must measure the quality of life of thepatient to ensure that the value of the drug incorporates the patient’sperspective. Quality of life is a concept that usually incorporates the physical,mental and social well-being of the patient. Initial doubts concerning the abilityof schizophrenic patients to provide reliable and valid reports of their ownquality of life led to the use of proxies for patient interviews. Caregivers andclinicians were consulted most often. However, recent research has shown thatthe use of proxies can produce very different results to those derived directlyfrom the patient’s responses. In addition, research now indicates thatschizophrenic patients are able to provide stable, reliable and valid self-reportsof their psychological well-being, health status and subjective evaluation ofdrug therapies (Awadet al., 1995).In measuring the quality of life to demonstrate a drug’s value, selection ofthe instrument, such as a questionnaire, depends on several factors.Instruments that have been designed to be particularly sensitive to the effectof a given disease and the drug therapy on the patient are called disease-specificinstruments. One good example of this is the Quality of Life in Schizophreniainstrument, or QLS. The QLS is a quality-of-life scale developed to measuresignificant impairment in patients’ intrapsychic, interpersonal and instrumentalfunctioning due to the deficit symptoms of schizophrenia. The QLS has beenvalidated in several schizophrenic patient populations and has been used inclinical trials of novel antipsychotic medications (Meltzeret al., 1993;Rosenhecket al., 1997; Hamiltonet al., 1998).Like other assessment instruments, the QLS was developed using patientinterviews and factor analysis to derive those dimensions and questions thatare most relevant to the patient’s experience (Heinrichset al., 1984). The QLSscale contains 21 items and is intended to be administered as a semi-structuredinterview. Each item consists of three parts: a brief statement is provided tohelp the interviewee understand and focus on the parameter to be assessed; anumber of suggested questions are provided that may help the interviewerbegin his exploration with the subject; and a seven-point scale is provided foreach item, with a brief description at four points to help the interviewee make306PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"his judgement and mark the appropriate point on the scale. The QLS providesa total scale score and four subscale scores in the areas of IntrapsychicFoundations, Interpersonal Relations, Instrumental Role and CommonObjects and Activities.Besides disease-specific instruments such as the QLS, more genericinstruments such as the EQ-5D (EuroQol Group, 1990) are available. TheEQ-5D was developed to measure the quality of life of the general population.This instrument has five dimensions or areas of focus: mobility, self-care, usualactivity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Patients are asked to respondto questions about these dimensions by checking the level that best describestheir current experience. Responses are ‘‘no problem’’, ‘‘some problem’’ or‘‘extreme problem’’. As with another generic instrument commonly used inmost disease states, the SF-36 (Ware, 1993), these responses can be comparedwith those of other disease states and therefore are more useful to the healthauthorities in determining the worth of the therapy. The EQ-5D is self-administered and was developed initially in Dutch, English, Finnish,Norwegian and Swedish at the same time. It is now available in manylanguages.In summary, disease-specific instruments are the most sensitive to changes inthe patient’s experience, whereas findings collected using generic instrumentsare more easily compared with population values for other therapies.9.3 METHODS OF CALCULATING THE VALUE OFPSYCHOPHARMACEUTICALSThe evidence of a drug’s value can be as simple as demonstrating efficacy andsafety that is equal to but less costly than a readily available therapy. Or, thepharmacoeconomic evidence of value can be expressed as highly technicalmathematical models using several sources of data to demonstrate the cost perquality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYs gained) by the new therapy insteadof the current therapies. Common elements of the demonstration of the valueof pharmaceuticals, such as psychopharmaceuticals, include an assessment ofthe costs and the outcomes of therapy. An assessment of costs includes thecosts of delivering the therapy and the costs avoided because of the therapy.The cost of delivering the therapy includes physician office visits for drugtitration monitoring or the cost of treating side effects. Side-effect treatmentcosts can be relatively low (nausea, vomiting, headache) or more costly, such astreatment for agranulocytosis (a rare but serious side effect of someantipsychotic and antidepressant medication). The costs avoided because ofthe therapy can include reductions in the rates of hospitalizations, outpatientvisits or costly procedures. An assessment of the outcomes of therapy caninclude such measures as a reduction in the relapse rate for epileptics or anPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND HEALTH ECONOMICS307"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"increase in the quality of life of the bipolar patient. In all cases, the costsconsidered are those related to the outcome being measured. Healtheconomists express this relationship between costs and a unit of clinical orpatient-reported outcomes as a cost-effectiveness ratio. This ratio is used toestimate the value of the drug to the patient, to the healthcare system and tosociety as a whole.Common methods used to demonstrate the value of a pharmaceutical arepresented in Table 9.1, and discussed below. Table 9.1 refers to alternativetherapies used to treat the same condition.9.3.1 COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS: COSTS PER COMMON UNITOF OUTCOMECost-effectiveness is an economic evaluation in which both the costs and theconsequences of treatments are examined. The denominator of the cost-effectiveness ratio can be an intermediate outcome, such as a delay in theprogression of a disease, or a final outcome, such as life-years saved. Oncethe outcome is measured, the costs associated with attaining this outcomeform the numerator of the ratio. For example, suppose our interest isdetermining the relative value of drug therapy for epilepsy versus epilepsy308PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONTable 9.1Health economic analysesType of studyValuation of costsin both alternativesIdentification ofconsequencesValuation ofconsequencesCost-effectivenessanalysisCurrency, such asdollars, euros orfrancsSingle effect ofinterest commonto both alternativesbut achieved todifferent degreesNatural units (e.g.life-years gained,disability-dayssaved, points ofblood pressurereduction, etc.)Cost-utilityanalysisCurrency, such asdollars, euros orfrancsSingle or multipleeffects notnecessarilycommon to bothalternativesHealthy years or(more often)quality-adjustedlife-yearsCost-minimizationanalysisCurrency, such asdollars, euros orfrancsIdentical in allrelevant respectsNoneCost–benefitanalysisCurrency, such asdollars, euros orfrancsSingle or multipleeffects not necessa-rily common toboth alternativesCurrency, such asdollars, euros orfrancsAdapted from Drummondet al.(1997)."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"surgery. The outcome of interest is seizure-free days, which is common to boththerapies. The therapies have a different degree of success in this outcome, aswell as different costs. We would not automatically choose the lowest costoption without first evaluating the differences in the outcome as well. So, wecalculate the number of seizure-free days and compare the cost of seizure-freedays for each therapy. This analysis, in which costs are related to a single,common effect that may differ in magnitude between alternative programs, isthe substance of a cost-effectiveness analysis. The results of this analysis areexpressed in terms of cost per seizure-free day. The outcome of interest is anyoutcome common to both therapies, and can include life-years gained, QALYsgained or costs per hospitalization days avoided.9.3.2 COST-UTILITY ANALYSIS: COSTS PER QALYA cost-effectiveness ratio is specific to the outcome measured, such as costs peradditional life-years gained or costs per hospital days avoided. What somehealth authorities want to determine with regard to a drug’s value is a singlemeasure that incorporates all the outcomes as well as all the costs of the drugtreatment. Such a broad-based measure captures how much improved thepatient’s life becomes as the result of treatment and at what cost. Each drugcan have its unique effect on a combination of factors that determines thedrug’s value overall. These factors may include increases in the life expectancyof a patient as well as factors reflecting preferences for the experience of lifeduring that increased number of years.These preferences for the different disease states, expressed as numbers, arecalled utilities, and are used to quality-adjust or to weight the additional yearsof survival. The result is a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Quality-adjusted life-years gained are also used frequently as the denominator of a cost-effectiveness ratio, as in costs per QALYs gained.Utilities are assessed using methods such as clinical judgement, standardgamble techniques or time trade-off techniques. (For more information onthese techniques see Drummondet al., 1997, because a description of thesetechniques is beyond the scope of this text.) However, a helpful illustration ofhow these utilities could be calculated is provided by the example of using avisual analog scale (Fig. 9.1). When presented with such a scale, with death asthe zero point on the scale and perfect health as the value of 1 at the other endof the scale, patients are asked, ‘‘How would you rate your experience while ontreatment A (or treatment B)?’’ Patients on treatment B rate their experience ashigher (better) than those on treatment A. This expressed preference for atreatment takes into consideration all aspects of each of these treatments fromthe patient’s perspective. From this information, the two treatments can becompared with each other by calculating the costs per QALY gained for eachtreatment.PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND HEALTH ECONOMICS309"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The following example is meant to provide an understanding of the conceptof costs per QALYs gained. Suppose we have two treatments: treatment A andtreatment B. The costs and the outcomes of these therapies are presented inTable 9.2. At first glance, it appears that an additional year of life resultingfrom treatment A will cost $10 000 ($10 000 more than treatment B for onemore year of life). However, the utilities for each of these treatments reflect thequality of life during those years, and treatment A is not rated as highly astreatment B when it comes to the patient’s perspective (health state). When thelife expectancy on the drug is weighted by the utility of that time (lifeexpectancy multiplied by health state), we have QALYs that differ by only 0.2years, or about 2.4 months, instead of 12 unadjusted months.Thus, the concept of utility is a general concept for measuring the value thatindividuals attach to the consequences of various actions, in this case theconsequences of different treatment options (Lane, 1987). The goal of thismeasurement technique is to obtain a numerical value that represents thestrength of the general public’s preferences for a particular outcome (Torranceand Feeny, 1989). An important point about this technique is that thesepreferences can be developed using patient-reports or using a representativesample of a healthcare system’s population. The reason why the public’spreferences are used more commonly than those of patients who actuallyexperience the disease stages being rated is the issue of rationing healthcare.Because most national healthcare systems have limited budgets, healthauthorities tend to use the perception of the general public to ration needed310PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 9.1Visual analog scale for cost-utility analysisTable 9. 2Comparison of two treatments using cost-utility analysisInterventionCost ($)Effectiveness(life expectancy)Health state(utility)QALYsTreatment A20 0004.50.602.7Treatment B10 0003.50.722.5"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"services. Using the public’s preferences in comparing QALYs gained frommany differing therapies gives these health authorities a more accurate pictureof the relative merits of these differing therapies.Usually utilities are presented as a single unit value for a defined diseasestate. They reflect the physical, mental and social aspects of the disease. Theintent is to come up with a single number that reflects the person’s experienceof a disease state. Generally defined disease states are descriptions of normal(unimpaired), mild, moderate or severely impaired states of a disease orsymptom. The utilities attached to them can represent specific aspects of thedisease experiences. For example, utilities can be measured for a specific drug-induced side effect.Returning to our example, we can now examine the costs per QALYs fortreatment A and treatment B. Table 9.3 illustrates these calculations. As thetable shows, when calculating the incremental cost per effect (cost-effectivenessratio) using unadjusted life-years gained, treatment A costs $10 000 for thatadditional year of life. But when we use the QALYs gained we see that thisadditional QALY actually costs $50 000.This example illustrates the concept of utilities and their use in comparingtwo therapies, but utilities can be compared between disease states as well ascomparing two therapies for the same disease. Table 9.4 lists the utilities forselected disease states from the literature.When presenting a cost per QALY gained figure, it is important to put it inperspective. At what point does the cost for an additional QALY become toohigh? For this answer, the cost of a QALY can be compared to the cost ofQALYs in other treatments. Examples of cost per QALY ratios (in 1999 USdollars) include estrogen therapy for postmenopausal women ($67 165),coronary artery bypass graft for single-vessel disease with moderate to severePSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND HEALTH ECONOMICS311Table 9.3Analysis of the costs per QALYs for two treatmentsInterventionCost ($)Effectiveness(life expectancy)Health state(utility)QALYsTreatment A20 0004.50.602.7Treatment B10 0003.50.722.5Incremental cost effectiveness ratio¼$20 0007$10 000¼$10 000 per life-year gained4.5 y73.5 yIncremental cost-utility ratio¼$20 0007$10 000¼$50 000 per QALY gained2.772.5 QALYsSource: Bootman, J.

When introducing a new therapy, the cost/QALY ratio can becompared with other, currently accepted therapies to determine the relativemerit of the new therapy to the population.9.3.3 COST-MINIMIZATION ANALYSIS: COMPARISON OFPROGRAMS WITH EQUAL OUTCOMESWhen it is assumed that the effectiveness of two therapies is equal, theeffectiveness part of the cost-effectiveness ratio can be dropped from theanalysis. In this situation, only the cost differences between the two therapiesare examined. Usually this includes the cost of the drug, costs ofadministration, the treatment of side effects or adverse reactions and theincidence and prevalence of the condition. For example, Fentonet al.(1982)compared the costs of home versus hospital treatment of psychiatric patientswhen the outcomes of each were considered not to differ in any respect exceptthat one requires a hospital stay and the other does not. The cost-minimizationanalysis simply looked at the differences in costs of the two treatments. Theresult is, not unexpectedly, that hospitalization was 64% more expensive thanhome-based treatment.9.3.4 COST^BENEFIT ANALYSIS: COMPARISON OF PROGRAMSWITH DIFFERENT OUTCOMESThe termcost–benefitrefers to the comparison of incremental program costs withincremental program benefits, and both are expressed in monetary terms.

This enables an examination of whether ornot each of the programs’ benefits exceeds its costs, indicating that there is a netsocial benefit and the programs are worthwhile. This analysis also allows thecomparison of programs with outcomes across different clinical indications, suchas a comparison of programs for schizophrenia and epilepsy, where the outcomesmight be hospital days avoided and seizure-free days, respectively. Because allcosts and benefits are measured in monetary terms, it is possible to compare aprogram’s benefits with other healthcare programs and to make informedresource allocation decisions both within and between sectors of the economy.For example, Weisbrodet al.(1980) quantified and valued a wide range of costsand benefits on conventional hospital-oriented versus community-based pro-grams for mental illness. Generally speaking, they found that the community-based programs were more costly, but they produced a higher value of benefitsbecause the patients are able to gain employment while being treated asoutpatients.9.3.5 MODELING AS A TOOL FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSISModeling is an analytical tool that can be used to extrapolate shorter termclinical results, such as days of improved symptoms in Parkinson’s diseasepatients in a study over 6 months, to longer time periods. A model wasdeveloped to extrapolate the results of a 6-month trial in which patientsreceived either levodopa alone or levodopa plus the catechol-o-methyltransfer-ase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone. Comtan1(entacapone) is designed toreduce the metabolism of levodopa in peripheral tissue and vessels so that moreof the drug is available in the brain at a more constant rate than is seen withlevodopa alone. The 6-month clinical trial produced clinical results that allowus to establish entacapone’s effect on the ‘OFF’ time associated with levodopatherapy. ‘OFF’ time refers to a re-emergence of symptoms prior to the nextscheduled levodopa dose. Entacapone reduces the ‘OFF’ time and increases the‘ON’ time of levodopa therapy.Figure 9.2 illustrates the various inputs and outputs of a model built todemonstrate the 5-year results of therapy with entacapone (Comtan1), whichrepresents a novel pharmacological principle used in combination withlevodopa therapy. The inputs list the data fed into the model. The clinicaleffects of the therapy are taken from the clinical trials. The costs by diseasestage are defined as costs for425% ‘OFF’ time per day (severe stage) andcosts for525% ‘OFF’ time per day (less severe) and are taken from literaturesources. Patient preference data (used to calculate QALYs) for these twodisease stages are taken from a separate study of patient preferences. Theoutputs of the model list some of the more common uses of the model:PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND HEALTH ECONOMICS313"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"differences in the quality of life of the two therapy alternatives (usual care vs.usual care plus entacapone), differences in the costs of these two therapies,differences in the 5-year clinical outcomes based on the 6-month results of theclinical trial and the cost utility (or costs/QALY).Presented in Fig. 9.3 is an example of a model used to extrapolate the 6-month trial results of a COMT inhibitor (entacapone) used in combinationwith levodopa versus levodopa alone in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.This particular model is an example of a Markov model.A Markov process model describes several discrete health states in which aperson can exist at timet, as well as the health states into which the person maymove at timet+1. A person can reside in just one health state at any giventime. The progression from timetto timet+1 is known as a cycle. All clinicallyimportant events are modeled as transitions in which a person moves from onehealth state to another. The probabilities associated with each change betweenhealth states are known as transition probabilities. Each transition probabilityis a function of the health state and the treatment.The Markov model uses the clinical data to calculate the probability oftransitioning from a severe disease state (‘OFF’ time425% of the day), to aless severe disease state (‘OFF’ time525% of the day) for entacapone therapy.This enables a calculation of the total amount of time a cohort of patients will314PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTIONFigure 9.2Model used to show the 5-year results of therapy with entacapone(Comtan1)"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"spend in the less severe state, versus placebo, after extrapolating the clinicaltrial results from 6 months to 5 years. The difference in the time spent in thesetwo disease states is reflected in the differences between the costs of managingpatients in these two disease states, with costs being higher for the more severestate. The difference in those costs over the 5-year period equals theincremental cost effectiveness of entacapone, expressed as incremental costsper years in525% ‘OFF’ time per day.The results of the application of this model are, among others, that:differences in clinical outcomes exist between levodopa alone and entacaponeplus levodopa; entacapone substantially improved the amount of time spentwith525% ‘OFF’ time; living with525% ‘OFF’ time per day was increasedby 0.63 years (or 7.6 months) over the 5-year time period; and the costs perQALY gained were $9221 and $20 986 for total and direct medical costs,respectively.Models are also useful in strategic project planning to compare the costs andbenefits of competing therapies, such as the current standard therapy forschizophrenia and a theoretical drug profile of an antipsychotic designed toimprove the therapeutic effect for schizophrenia patients. The costs andbenefits can be compared to determine the optimal profile (one that wouldproduce the best possible results) as well as the minimal profile (the propertiesthat a compound must demonstrate to show a clinically meaningfulimprovement over the standard therapy).PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND HEALTH ECONOMICS315Figure 9.3Markov model used to extrapolate 6-month trial results of entacapone pluslevodopa versus lovodopa alone (standard treatment) (From Nuijtenet al.,2001).Reprinted with permission of Blackwell Publishing"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"9.4 SUMMARYThe field of health economics uses economic techniques to demonstrate thevalue of therapeutic approaches and technological advances available inhealthcare. When these economic techniques are used to demonstrate the valueof pharmaceuticals, the field is referred to as pharmacoeconomics. Thedemonstration of the value of a pharmaceutical is part of a larger process ofdemonstrating the efficacy, safety, quality of manufacture and cost-effective-ness of the drug. Establishing the efficacy, safety and quality of manufacture ofa drug is the traditional method of screening new therapies by health policy-makers but in recent years health policy-makers in many countries have alsorequested a demonstration of the value of the drug’s effectiveness, its impact onthe quality of life of the patients and the effect on the healthcare system’sbudget. Because of the pressure on health authorities to keep the cost ofhealthcare under control, when new psychopharmaceuticals are developed thedemonstration of their value to both the patient and the healthcare system isessential to ensure that patients have practical access to the therapy. Theperspective of the pharmacoeconomic analysis can differ, either by incorporat-ing only direct medical costs or by using a societal perspective that incorporatesall costs, including indirect medical costs, productivity costs and costs ofcaregiving by family or friends.The quality of life of the patient while on therapy is an importantdeterminant of the effectiveness of the therapy. If a patient has a badexperience with a drug, there is a likelihood that persistency and compliancewith the therapeutic regimen will be compromised. This, of course, makes thedrug less effective than originally valued. Therefore, an economic analysis mustmeasure the quality of life of the patient to ensure that the value of the drugincorporates the patient’s perspective. Quality of life is a concept that usuallyincorporates the physical, mental and social well-being of the patient. Anexample of a disease-specific instrument, the QLS, is designed to be sensitive tochanges in this specific disease. Although the data collected using the QLS areuseful to compare the quality of life of patients, e.g. in the two arms of aclinical trial, these results cannot be generalized to other populations outside ofthe trial cohort. This problem with disease-specific instruments is not the casewith more generic instruments such as the EQ-5D.Establishing the value of a new pharmaceutical can be done through a cost-effectiveness ratio, where the costs are compared with currently acceptedtherapy and the effect is expressed in natural units such as life-years gained ordisability-free days. A cost-utility analysis uses QALYs as the expression of thedrug’s effect, which is a measure that incorporates all the outcomes as well asall the costs of the drug treatment. Such a broad-based measure captures howmuch improved the patient’s life becomes as a result of the treatment and atwhat cost. Quality-adjusted life-years can be viewed as life-years gained,316PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"weighted by the patient’s experience of the treatment and its effects duringthose additional life-years. Costs per QALYs can be compared betweendiseases and their treatment to optimize the healthcare budget expenditure.Cost minimization is used to compare therapies with a similar outcome butdiffering costs.

Various data sourcesreporting the costs of treating the different disease stages, the clinical effect ofthe drug and the patient’s experience of each of those disease stages are used todemonstrate long-term treatment effects and costs.PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND HEALTH ECONOMICS317"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"EpilogueModern psychopharmacology is about 50 years old. Few doctors and nursessurvive to relate how clinical and ambulatory psychiatry looked and felt beforethe first neuroleptic and antidepressant medications became available. Drugtreatment is routine in today’s psychiatric practice, and even some of the mostsevere mental disorders are no longer fatal. In view of the dramatic therapeuticadvances brought about by psychopharmaceuticals it is of interest to ask howthe introduction of these drugs has affected psychiatry as a science and whatimpact psychopharmacology has had on psychology.Effect of Psychopharmacology on PsychiatryPathophysiology and NosologySpeaking in very general terms, the therapeutic effectiveness of psychophar-maceuticals promoted the view that some of the mental illnesses are treatableand that even healing can be obtained or facilitated with medicines, i.e. bymaterial and scientifically comprehensible means. Previously, views on thepathogenesis of mental disturbances had been largely psychodynamic and inthis sense immaterial: life history and social factors were considered decisive forthe pathogenesis and course of schizophrenic psychoses, affective disorder andso-called neuroses, whereas the biological side of psychiatric pathophysiologywas viewed as inaccessible. A rapid change occurred with the discovery ofneuroleptic and antidepressant drugs: the biological substrate of mentaldisorders returned to center-stage andbiological psychiatryincreased insignificance. Klerman (1987) spoke of a paradigm shift to highlight the returnfrom psychodynamically accentuated thinking to biologically orientated viewsin psychiatry, and to the nosological categories introduced by Kraepelin andBleuler early in the twentieth century: because neuroleptics were found to bePsychopharmacology, Fourth Edition.

This new view signified a rejection of the tendency, detectable untilabout 1955, to consider neuroses, depressions and schizophrenias as vaguelydelimited sections on a psychopathological continuum and not as separatenosological categories.Research in PsychiatryThe new orientation of psychiatry also had consequences for its researchmethodology: study design and the statistical evaluation of clinical trials, use ofstandardized methods for the clinical evaluation of patients, application ofelectrophysiological, biochemical, neuroendocrinological and, more recently,imaging procedures to study brain structures and processes are among theeveryday matters of biological psychiatry. Research activity is multidisciplinaryand psychiatrists nowadays must be able to interact with chemists,endocrinologists, psychologists, statisticians and even physicists and engineers.However, criticism of this technological form of psychiatry and research is notlacking even among biologically orientated authors: Goodwin and Roy Byrne(1987) complained of a ‘‘decline in scholarship’’ and by this they mean thetendency of many researchers to carry out expansive studies with the widestpossible range of modern equipment and procedures in the hope thatsomething useful will emerge in any case. They urge the execution of studiesthat either derive from and are planned on the basis of reasoned andformulated hypotheses or are characterized as exploratory and, in the service offinding hypotheses, are interpreted as such.Criticism of the ‘Medical Model’The opinion is sometimes heard or read that the advent of psychopharmaceu-ticals has brought back psychiatric thinking to the medical model. Mentaldisorders, it is said, are again considered to be due to one or perhaps a fewbiological causes that can be corrected by suitable means. A multifactorial wayof thinking (the view that genetic, historical, social, familial and individual lifehistory factors interact in a complex way until a mental disorder arises) is saidto be hindered, if not made impossible, by the medical model. A typicalexample of this monocausal and, in the final analysis, materialistic way ofthinking was the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, which places theemphasis on a single neurotransmitter and neglects other important elements,so that in turn it is discordant even with biological reality (in this case theinteraction between different neurotransmitter systems). Here is not the placeto discuss further or even refute this fundamental criticism of biologically320PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"orientated psychiatry; however it should be understood that the emphasis onand the scientific study of one or a few hypothetical pathogenetic factors of adisease do not necessarily imply that other factors are ignored or denied.Impact of Psychopharmacology on PsychologyOpportunities for PsychologistsWith the rise of psychopharmacology, new opportunities arose for psychol-ogists to do research work in mental hospitals and university-affiliated andprivate industry departments. Experimental studies and clinical trials withpsychotropic substances provide attractive settings for psychologists to applyfruitfully their knowledge of study design and methodology and play animportant part in the mostly multidisciplinary research teams. Examplesinclude the study of new psychopharmaceuticals in healthy subjects (Chapter 3)and patients (Chapter 5), conducting studies of drug effects on cognitiveprocesses (Chapter 7) as well as studying the effects of pharmacological andnon-drug interventions in psychiatric patients (Chapter 8).Psychologists as Prescribers of Psychopharmaceuticals?Psychotherapists without medical background are not licensed to prescribemedicines, so their therapeutic means were not immediately enhanced by theintroduction of modern psychopharmaceuticals. On the contrary, owing to thepossibility of choosing between or combining psychopharmaceuticals and non-drug therapies, medically qualified therapists had gained an advantage that ledmany psychologists to a violent rejection of drug therapies and combinedtreatments. Historically, however, the number of patients accessible topsychotherapy, and who requested non-drug treatment, increased as a resultof the de-institutionalization of psychiatry, so that the demand for the servicesof non-medical psychotherapists also increased.In the USA a discussion of whether psychologists should be granted‘prescription privileges’ for psychopharmaceuticals and whether training inpsychopharmacology needed to be part of the psychology curriculum waslaunched some time ago. Wiggins (1994) pointed out that the number ofpracticing psychologists exceeded that of psychiatrists, and that psychologistsmake a decisive contribution to public health. As a consequence, he and othersurged that non-medical psychotherapists be granted prescription authority,putting forward the following arguments (DeLeon and Wiggins, 1996;Pachman, 1996):.Psychologists are highly trained mental health professionals. Theirprofessional activities overlap by more than 90% with those of psychiatrists,except for the prescription of medication. In the interest of public mentalEPILOGUE321"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"health, and given the importance of psychopharmaceuticals in today’stherapy, it should be ascertained that these effective therapeutic meansbecome available to the largest group of mental health providers..The example of other health workers in the USA – nurse practitioners,physician assistants and optometrists – demonstrates that non-medicalprofessionals can be trained to adequately prescribe drugs within their areaof expertise. Pilot projects, e.g. in the state of California, with psychologistsprescribing psychopharmaceuticals with appropriate training and super-vision were successful in that ‘‘both the patients and supervising physicianswere comfortable with the clinical performance of the trainees’’ (De Leonand Wiggins, 1996, p. 226)..More than 80% of all psychiatric drugs are prescribed in the USA by non-psychiatrists, i.e. by physicians usually lacking the necessary training andexpertise regarding mental functioning and disorders. Licensed psycholo-gists would be more qualified to diagnose and treat mental disorders,including prescribing and monitoring the effects of psychotropic medica-tion.Other arguments put forward in the discussion deal with the symbolicmeaning of medication as part of the relationship between therapists andclients (Pachman, 1996) and with the difficulty of splitting responsibilities fortreatment between separate providers of pharmacological and psychotherapy.However, not all psychologists support the initiative to extend prescribingauthority to non-medical psychotherapists (see Lavoie and Fleet, 2002, forreview). Opponents generally pursue two separate lines of argument, onedealing with the basic difference between pharmaco- and psychotherapy (seealso Westra and Stewart, 1998), and the other with the professional identityand image of psychologists:.Although psychological and behavioral interventions may require moretime and effort than drug prescribing, these approaches are effective andoften more lasting than the use of medication. Drugs provide short-termrelief and symptomatic improvement; however, their effect is said to betransient and there is evidence that medication can interfere with the patientacquiring more adaptive thinking and behavioral patterns. Furthermore,with drug treatment the patients ‘‘tend to attribute help as coming fromoutside of themselves, rather than seeing improvement as the product oftheir own effort’’ (DeNelsky, 1996, p. 207)..The authority to prescribe drugs necessitates extensive and thoroughtraining in areas such as pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, metabolismand drug interactions. This entails the risk that psychologists spend moretime studying medicine and less time learning psychology, i.e. to acquire lesscompetence in the domains where their knowledge and experience mustexcel that of other mental health professionals. In exchange they may earn322PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"the reputation of ‘‘junior psychiatrists’’ and ‘‘psychology would likely beincreasingly perceived as those ‘other guys’ who can prescribe psychoactivemedications – the ones who can write prescriptions without having gone tomedical school.’’ (DeNelsky, 1996, p. 209).As a psychologist who has spent most of his professional life doing researchand teaching in psychopharmacology I will not attempt to determine whichgroup owns the better arguments. I am convinced, however, that thoroughknowledge of psychotropic drugs, especially psychopharmaceuticals, is anecessity for mental health professionals who are in contact with patients andclients who are, have been or will be taking one of these drugs. Counseling andclinical psychologists, psychotherapists as well as community and socialworkers will deal with these individuals and solid knowledge of psychophar-maceuticals is indispensable – also when talking to physicians who are inmedical charge of shared patients.Psychotropic Drugs and Psychology as a ScienceA question of interest is whether psychology as a science has been influenced bypsychopharmacology, e.g. in what areas and to what extent could psycho-logical theory profit from modern psychopharmacology. From the history ofpsychology it is known that great figures like Freud and William Jamesexperimented to various degrees with psychotropic drugs, but it is probablydifficult to demonstrate direct relationships between these authors’ experimentsand theories. Ornstein (1972) expressed the view that the preoccupation withhallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and marihuana, the so-called drug culture ofthe 1960s, has contributed to the reawakening of interest in questions of thepsychology of consciousness. More specifically, in the early years of modernpsychopharmacology, authors such as Eysenck (1962), Lienert (1964) andJanke (1964) performed pharmacopsychological experiments primarily withtheoretical objectives. Drugs were applied because they made it possible toinduce reproducible, qualitatively different and quantitatively graded mod-ifications of the mental state in healthy volunteers. Manipulations of this kindcan hardly be performed in ethical ways by other means, e.g. sleep deprivationor frustration and other challenging situations. Eysenck (1962) tested specificpredictions of his personality theory by modifying the drive level of healthysubjects using stimulant and sedative substances. Lienert (1964) hoped toclarify some ontogenetic aspects of the development of intelligence by usingLSD. Seen from today’s perspective, the theoretical yield of these experimentswas modest and they were subsequently virtually abandoned.On the other hand, pharmacopsychology has brought some practical benefitto applied psychology. From experiments with drugs we now know thesensitivities of various methods for measuring modifications of arousal andEPILOGUE323"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"mood (Chapter 3) and the methodological experience gained in these studiescan be transferred to other fields such as occupational and traffic psychology aswell as therapeutic research.However, in my own opinion the primary relevance of psychopharmacologyto psychology lies in the recognition that psychological theories and practiceare incomplete and not appropriate to their subject unless they consider thebiological substrate underlying all mental processes (mood, affect, arousal,cognition, actions and reflection). It is biological processes, controlled andinfluenced partly internally and partly externally, that underlie our mental life.Some of these processes and their biological carriers are accessible today bytechnical means: we study cells, cell constituents, synapses; and we measureconcentrations of neurotransmitters, enzyme activities and intracellularmessengers in the living organism. Electroencephalogram and evoked potentialrecordings give an overview on the electrical correlates of mental processes,and techniques such as single-photon-emission computed tomography(SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) provide surprisingly detailed information onprocesses occurring in different brain areas while we listen, observe, imagine,decide, etc. Tomorrow there will be other, still better measurement methods,other targets to measure and novel concepts of brain function. An essential andparticularly exciting element of these activities is the oscillation betweenvarious levels of study and measurement, all covering a part of reality, and inthis way the interdisciplinary approach to working and thinking also answersthe old question of the primacy of material and spirit: there is no primacy, weare and we need both.324PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"World Medical A s sociationDeclaration of HelsinkiEthical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human SubjectsAdopted by the 18th WMA General AssemblyHelsinki, Finland, June 1964and amended by the29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 197535th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 198341st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 198948th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa,October 199652nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000Introduction(1) The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinkias a statement of ethical principles to provide guidance to physicians andother participants in medical research involving human subjects.

Even the bestproven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods must bechallenged continuously through research for their effectiveness,efficiency, accessibility and quality.(7) In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic,diagnostic and therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.(8) Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for allhuman beings and protect their health and rights. Some researchpopulations are vulnerable and need special protection. The particularneeds of the economically and medically disadvantaged must berecognized. Special attention is also required for those who cannot giveor refuse consent for themselves, for those who may be subject to givingconsent under duress, for those who will not benefit personally from theresearch and for those for whom the research is combined with care.(9) Research investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatoryrequirements for research on human subjects in their own countries as wellas applicable international requirements. No national ethical, legal orregulatory requirement should be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of theprotections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration.Basic Principles for All Medical Research(10) It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life,health, privacy and dignity of the human subject.(11) Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generallyaccepted scientific principles and be based on a thorough knowledge ofthe scientific literature, other relevant sources of information andadequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.(12) Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research thatmay affect the environment, and the welfare of animals used for researchmust be respected.(13) The design and performance of each experimental procedure involvinghuman subjects should be formulated clearly in an experimental protocol.This protocol should be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance326PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"and, where appropriate, approval to a specially appointed ethical reviewcommittee, which must be independent of the investigator, the sponsor orany other kind of undue influence. This independent committee should bein conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which theresearch experiment is performed. The committee has the right to monitorongoing trials. The researcher has the obligation to provide monitoringinformation to the committee, especially any serious adverse events. Theresearcher should also submit to the committee, for review, informationregarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other potentialconflicts of interest and incentives for subjects.(14) The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethicalconsiderations involved and should indicate that there is compliance withthe principles enunciated in this Declaration.(15) Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only byscientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinicallycompetent medical person. The responsibility for the human subject mustalways rest with a medically qualified person and never rest on the subjectof the research, even though the subject has given consent.(16) Every medical research project involving human subjects should bepreceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens incomparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others. This doesnot preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical research.The design of all studies should be publicly available.(17) Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involvinghuman subjects unless they are confident that the risks involved havebeen assessed adequately and can be managed satisfactorily. Physiciansshould cease any investigation if the risks are found to outweigh thepotential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficialresults.(18) Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only ifthe importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdensto the subject. This is especially important when the human subjects arehealthy volunteers.(19) Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood thatthe populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit fromthe results of the research.(20) The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the researchproject.(21) The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always berespected. Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of thesubject, the confidentiality of the patient’s information and to minimizethe impact of the study on the subject’s physical and mental integrity andon the personality of the subject.WMA DECL ARATION OF HELSINKI327"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"(22) In any research on human beings, each potential subject must beadequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, anypossible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, theanticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort itmay entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain fromparticipation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at anytime without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood theinformation, the physician should then obtain the subject’s freely-giveninformed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtainedin writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented andwitnessed.(23) When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physicianshould be particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationshipwith the physician or may consent under duress. In that case the informedconsent should be obtained by a well-informed physician who is notengaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of thisrelationship.(24) For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentallyincapable of giving consent or is a legally incompetent minor, theinvestigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorizedrepresentative in accordance with applicable law. These groups shouldnot be included in research unless the research is necessary to promote thehealth of the population represented and this research cannot instead beperformed on legally competent persons.(25) When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is ableto give assent to decisions about participation in research, the investigatormust obtain that assent in addition to the consent of the legallyauthorized representative.(26) Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent,including proxy or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed consent is a necessarycharacteristic of the research population. The specific reasons forinvolving research subjects with a condition that renders them unableto give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol forconsideration and approval of the review committee. The protocol shouldstate that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon aspossible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.(27) Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication ofthe results of research, the investigators are obliged to preserve theaccuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results should bepublished or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding,institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should bedeclared in the publication.

When medical research is combined withmedical care, additional standards apply to protect the patients who areresearch subjects.(29) The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should betested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic andtherapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or notreatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic ortherapeutic method exists.To clarify further the WMA position on the use of placebo-controlled trials,the WMA Council issued, during October 2001, a note of clarification onParagraph 29 readable at the end of this list.(30) At the conclusion of the study, every patient entered into the study shouldbe assured of access to the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic andtherapeutic methods identified by the study.(31) The physician should fully inform the patient which aspects of the care arerelated to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a studymust never interfere with the patient–physician relationship.(32) In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic andtherapeutic methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician,with informed consent from the patient, must be free to use unproven ornew prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures if, in thephysician’s judgment, it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing healthor alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be madethe object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In allcases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate,published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should befollowed.Note of Clarification on Paragraph 29 of the DeclarationThe WMA is concerned that Paragraph 29 of the revised Declaration ofHelsinki (October 2000) has led to diverse interpretations and possibleconfusion. It hereby reaffirms its position that extreme care must be taken inmaking use of a placebo-controlled trial and that in general this methodologyshould be used only in the absence of existing proven therapy. However, aplacebo-controlled trial may be ethically acceptable, even if proven therapy isavailable, under the following circumstances:WMA DECL ARATION OF HELSINKI329"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":".Where, for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons, itsuse is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of a prophylactic,diagnostic or therapeutic method..Where a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method is being investi-gated for a minor condition and the patients who receive placebo will not besubject to any additional risk of serious or irreversible harm.All other provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki must be adhered to,especially the need for appropriate ethical and scientific review.330PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AN INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"ReferencesAckerknecht, E.H.:Kurze Geschichte der Psychiatrie.

Presynaptic α2-adrenoceptors are located on monoamine terminals,where they provide feedback inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Postsynaptic receptorshave been identified on a variety of neurons (Raiteri et al.,1990, Aoki et al.,1994). In theperiphery, these compounds result in an increase of norepinephrine release through blockingthe presynaptic receptors on noradrenergic neurons. The FDG-PET scans were obtainedbefore and after the infusion. The individual image files of glucose metabolic rate werewarped into the Talairach atlas. The post-drug metabolic rate was compared to the pre-drugmetabolic rate voxel by voxel within subject using t-tests. Voxels that significantly differedwere mapped onto an MRI template. White areas reflect an average increase at a threshold ofp<0.001, red areas at a threshold of p<0.01 and orange areas at a threshold of p<0.05. The 12μ g/kg dose resulted in more diffuse increases than the lower dose (Schmidt et al.,1999).Reproduced with permission of Springer-Verlag GmbH & Co.
