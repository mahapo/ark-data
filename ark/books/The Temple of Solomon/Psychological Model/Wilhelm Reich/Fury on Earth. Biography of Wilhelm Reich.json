Its social nature was enhanced by the lengthof the undertaking: formal work began eleven years ago but I have been heading toward thegoal of a Reich biography since 1946. Also, as I detail in Chapter2, this project was oftenless the focused writing of a book than a painful process of self-discovery, requiring as muchhelp from others as did the more intellectual components of the task.I want to thank first those I interviewed about Reich and his work: Elsworth F.Baker, Kari Berggrav, Grete Bibring, Richard Blasband, David Boadella, Walter Briehl, EdithBuxbaum, Lilian Bye, K. R. Eissler, Ernst Federn, Margaret Fried, George Gero, BernardGrad, Jerome Greenfield, Nathan Cabot Hale, Sidney Handelman, Charles Haydon, OttilieHeifetz, Morton Herskowitz, Sigurd Hoel, Grethe Hoff, Rosetta Hurwitz, Edith Jacobson,Jo Jenks, Lia Laszky, Elsa Lindenberg, Alexander Lowen, Bob McCullough, Gladys Meyer,Mitzi Mills, A. S. Neill, Use Ollendorff, Ernst Papanek, Ola Raknes, Chester M. Raphael,Eva Reich, Peter Reich, Tom Ross, Lore Reich Ruben, Fredrick Silber, Victor Sobey, GiselaStein,Richard Sterba,Kenneth Tynan, Nic Waal, James A. Willie, and Lois Wyvell.Some of these interviews were brief. Others required several sessions. The bookitself will make clear, for example, how much the vivid, detailed recollections of Lia Laszkyand Ottilie Heifetz, both now deceased, help me to understand the young Reich more fully.However, only here can I convey what a personal pleasure it was to get to know their livelyminds and temperaments. Of those I met in the course of the research, Elsa Lindenbergalso holds a special place. Between 1957 and 1978 we met five times, for several hours oneach occasion. Her depth of perception and emotion enriched not only my work but alsomy life.My relationship with some ofthe interviewees antedated the research by manyyears. I would like to single out a few of these old friends for special thanks. Use Ollendorffgave me the benefit ofher warm support and was always available to discuss a troublesomepoint about Reich’s personality or work. Also, until I made my own biographical effort I didnot fully appreciate the value ofher concise volume,Wilhelm Reich: A Personal Biography.Whenever I had a question about the facts, I could rely on her information to be accurateto the smallest detail. I am grateful for her permission to quote so extensively from her biog-raphy.When I began my research, Peter Reich was deeply engaged in setting down hisown recollections ofReich in A Book ofDreams.He generously helped me not only withinformation but by sharing the peculiar pleasure and pain of trying to capture in words one’sevolving vision of an extraordinary father and teacher.Ofall those who knew and studied with Reich, Eva Reich has perhaps the mostextensive knowledge ofhis work and life. I am forever thankful that over countless hoursshe shared that knowledge with an unrestrained givingness. Like Use, she had no need to tryMyron SharafFury On Earth8éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"aknowledments9éditionsles atomes de l’âmeto make sure that I painted an “authorized” portrait any more than she wanted a negativecaricature. At his best, Reich desired that an entirely honest view of his work and personal-ity should enter the historical record; that spirit seems to have rubbed off on many whowere close to him.I have known Gladys Meyer since 1946. She was helpful to me then and she hasremained so during the intervening years. In numerous conversations I had the benefit ofher discerning, candid mind focused on Reich and, especially, the relationship between Reichand Theodore Wolfe. We have had our differences of opinion or emphasis, but to a remark-able degree she embodies the true liberal spirit, which expects disagreement. Finally, I can-not cite here her thousand acts of personal kindness on my behalf.Elsworth F. Baker was always available to give whatever information he had thatcould be of use to me. However, my thanks to him center more on his intangible contribu-tions. From the start of the project to its conclusion, he buoyed my self-confidence throughhis confidence in me.Lois Wyvell played a key role in transforming the diffuse vapor of my biographicalambition into workable steam in 1971 she recommended me to a publisher seeking a biog-rapher of Reich. She also gave me her valuable recollections based on her association withReich over many years.David Boadella and I have been corresponding about orgonomy since the 1950s. Ihave found his book Wilhelm Reich: The Evolution of His Worka treasure trove of facts andinterpretations.Jerome Greenfield and I met in the early 1970s when he was working on his bookWilhelm Reich VS. the U.S.A.Since then we have exchanged considerable information. Hismeticulous research on the Food and Drug Administration’s investigation of the orgoneaccumulator spared me much effort.During the 1960s Nathan Cabot Hale encouraged me to begin this biography. I amalso grateful to him for sharing precious data concerning the Norwegian newspaper cam-paign against Reich and regarding the FDA’s activities. With David, Jerry, and Nathan, I havefelt the joy ofbeing present at the beginning of genuine historical scholarship in orgonomy.I would like to thank David Blasband for his generous and astute legal counsel.Douglas Levinson helped immeasurably with the conceptualization and writing ofChapter 16.He has also brought an informed background in orgonomy and in several aca-demic disciplines to our long-standing dialogue about Reich’s work.An important source ofencouragement and illumination was my participation in agroup experience coextensive with the writing of this book. The group was made up oftherapists who were also friends. During hectic periods this collectivity provided a kind ofsafety net for me. Most importantly, our work together facilitated my better emotional andintellectual comprehension of themes, such as the expression of negative feeling, fusion,and separation, issues that also pervaded my relationship with Reich.

Bob Rosenthalhad a less intense interest in “Reichian” concepts, but precisely this distance combined withopen-mindedness and strong personal involvement helped to maintain the steadiness of ourvaluable friendship.A number of other colleagues and friends gave me encouragement or friendly crit-icism: Courtney Baker, Alvin Becker, John Bell, John Bellis, Dorothy Burlage, JudithChadwick, Art Efron, Susan Gulick, Eva Hartmann, Barbara Koopman, Alexander Lowen,Greg Lombardo, Paul Mathews, Karl McLaurin, Jacob and Patricia Meyerowitz, JohnPierrakos, Roberta Reich (no relation), Philip Reimherr, Bob Risse, Meatchie Russell,Michael Sales, Terry Santino, Gabrielle Sichel, Jean Stamps, Beth Strassberg, James Tropp,William Tropp, Kathy Vieweg, Mary Watkins, and Colin Wilson.Bob Risse has been the kind of friend in whom I could confide doubts and anxi-eties I was scarcely able to acknowledge to myself.I am grateful to several “non Reichian” colleagues I met in the 1950s at theMassachusetts Mental Health Center, my second intellectual home. First and foremost isDaniel J.Levinson,whose elegant sociopsychological approach to adult development in gen-eral and career development in particular so permeates my own thing that I cannot begin toitemize the particularities of my intellectual debt to him.As a leader, Milton Greenblatt provided me with an example radically differentfrom Reich’s. He welcomed diversity of thought, a new experience after my total immersionin Reich’s relentless pursuit of his own paradigm. His stance toward this biography ferventsupport combined with informed criticism has often renewed my spirits.Ernest Hartmann read chapters ever since 1 started the writing. Like Milton, he hasbeen a friendly critic of my interest in Reich’s scientific work, thereby stimulating me to honemy arguments as sharply as I could. Ernest has also been a strong, gentle frienda friend forall seasons.Leston Havens and 1 have been carrying on a wide-ranging conversation for twen-ty-five years. His always stimulating and sometimes provocative mind has clarified andexpanded my own position regarding Reich’s psychiatric work.An old friend and collaborator, Evelyn M. Stone, has warmly encouraged myresearch, writing, and speaking on Reich’s life and work.During the research phase and the writing of the first chapters, the late Larry Schiffwas a precious friend and counselor. The world and I have been robbed by his untimelydeath ofa prince ofthis earth honest,enthusiastic, perceptive, and endlessly giving.Several persons helped in an editorial capacity. Before I met my editor, JoyceEngelson, I thought the age of the great editors was over. I was wrong.

As the project neared completion, she worked sideby side with me in the final preparation of the manuscript. I shall never forget her tactfulfervor during that difficult time.When I was bogged down in shortening the manuscript to a manageable length,Joyce made it possible for me to obtain the help of an editorial consultant, Alison Bond.Alison helped cut the manuscript and much more. With a keen eye for confusion and holesin the story, she participated in a thorough rewriting of a number of chapters. Our corre-spondence and intense working days together rank among my most treasured professionalexperiences.Grace M. Clark did a meticulous job of typing a clean manuscript from a cluttereddraft. In the process she caught a number of my errors. Ann Adelman was a superb copy-editor; she submerged herself in the sense as well as the syntax of the pages. Erika Schmid’scareful proofreading was of invaluable assistance. As managing editor for St. Martin’s, CarolE. W. Edwards combined expertise with enthusiasm in a way that made working with her agreat pleasure. Joyce Engelson’s assistant, Jeff Pettus, had an unflappable temperament anda passion for detail that helped us through some difficult spots.Editorially last but functionally perhaps first,I would like to thank Richard Marek,publisher of the St. Martin’s/Marek imprint. He gave us steadfast, uncomplaining support,and from a position where the buck stopped.It was my agent, Susan Ann Protter, who put me in contact with Joyce and Alison.The agent for several other books about Reich, she brought an informed awareness to myproject. Through all the problems she was a partner who showed astonishing grace underpressure. As one of the few persons who was with the project from inception to comple-tion, she holds a special place in my affection. Susan, our long journey is over. Thanks! My former wife Grethe Hoff participated in many of the experiences described inthis book.I cherish and learned from her honesty and independence of mind toward Reichand his work. Until his death in 1979 our son Peter encouraged me with love and humor tofinish the task.His support was all the more significant because the emotional entangle-ments among Grethe, Reich, and myself had cost him dearly.My wife Giselle brought unusual qualities ofmind and heart to the undertaking.She often had a sure instinct for lapses in tone or content in my psychological depictions.Her quiet integrity provided my grounding. Above all, she had faith in the book and in me.The public reads a book; a wife shared the reality, often grim, of rendering that work.Giselle, my love and gratitude!

His fellow inmates were tem-porarily kept waiting while a check was made to find the missing prisoner 1. The world as awhole scarcely noticed. True, Reich’s earlier prominence as a psychoanalyst merited a briefmilestone in Time:Died. Wilhelm Reich, 60, once-famed psychoanalyst, associate, and follower ofSigmund Freud, founder of the Wilhelm Reich Foundation, lately better known forunorthodox sex and energy theories; of a heart attack in Lewisburg FederalPenitentiary, Pa.; where he was serving a two-year term for distributing his invention,the “orgone energy accumulator” (in violation of the Food and Drug Act), a tele-phone-booth-size device which supposedly gathered energy from the atmosphere,and could cure, while the patient sat inside, common colds, cancer and impotence 2.No matter that Reich never claimed the accumulator could cure colds, cancer, orimpotence. What little comment his death aroused was mostly of the brief, inaccurate kindtypified by Time’s obituary. Only a few newspapers, such as the anarchist publication Freedom,in London 3, and The Village Voice4, carried more extensive, serious obituaries. Established sci-entific journals maintained a total silence.Not a single psychiatric journal carried any mentionofhis death, though “In Memoriam” statements are thp rule in such publications when amajor contributor to psychiatry dies. Yet the received opinion about Reich was that he hadindeed made very substantial contributions to psychoanalysis in the 1920s before he became“psychotic.” However, it is understandable why the profession was so silent. Representativesofits organizations had been active in urging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) tolaunch the investigation that ultimately jailed Reich, and they had congratulated the FDA onits successful prosecution ofthe case5.If the world at large showed indifference or said “good riddance/’ about fifty per-sons who had studied with Reich or admired him from a distance attended his funeral, whichwas conducted on the grounds of Orgonon, Reich’s zoo-acre estate near the small town ofRangeley, Maine. The atmosphere was emotionally charged. Charles Haydon, Reich’s chieflegal adviser during his difficulties with the FDA, said some fifteen years later that it remind-ed him of the funeral of a Viking chieftain 6. Reich’s presence dominated in death, as it had inlife, when the bereft community gathered to mourn him amid the falling November snow.Myron SharafFury On Earth14éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"15éditionsles atomes de l’âmeIt was in keeping with Haydon’s chieftain image that Reich should have left detailedinstructions for his own funeral, specifying no religious ceremony but a record of Schubert’s“Ave Maria,” sung by Marian Anderson. A year earlier he had bought a coffin from a Mainecraftsman 7. He had also designated a plot of land in the woods at Orgonon overlooking themountains and lakes, where his memorial was to consist of a simple granite slab with thewords:Wilhelm ReichBorn March 24, 1897Died —At the funeral, Dr. Elsworth F. Baker, the physician closest to Reich in his last years,delivered the following brief oration:“Friends, we are here to say farewell, a last farewell, to Wilhelm Reich. Let us pausefor a moment to appreciate the privilege, the incredible privilege, of having knownhim. Once in a thousand years, nay once in two thousand years, such a man comesupon this earth to change the destiny of the human race. As with all great men, dis-tortion,falsehood, and persecution followed him. He met them all, until organizedconspiracy sent him to prison and then killed him. We have witnessed it all, TheMurder of Christ.’ What poor words can I say that can either add to or clarify whathe has done? His work is finished. He has earned his peace and has left a vast her-itage for the peoples of this earth. We do not mourn for him, but for ourselves, atour great loss. Let us take up the responsibility of his work and follow in the path hecleared for us. So be it.”8Already we note the first paradox in a life that had been full of them: the contrastbetween how the professional community at large regarded his work and how a small groupoffollowers viewed his achievement. This ambiguity is compounded by the fact that whatmost people considered his major accomplishment, his contributions to psychoanalytic tech-nique,Reich and his close associates at the end deemed of secondary importance. And whatthe received opinion regarded as a hoax or delusion, Reich’s work on orgone energy, he andhis associates came to believe was his truly significant set of discoveries.Some twenty-five years later, it is clear that matters are more complicated than thestandard view of 1957 portrayed them. Today, there is a surge of interest in Reich’s work thatis pushing hard against the stereotyped view of Reich as a “good psychoanalyst” who wentastray in the late 1920s. At least some of what he “went astray” about has colored the cultur-al climate in a major fashion. Reich’s work of the 1930s and 1940s on the muscular armor—chronic muscular spasms representing the somatic anchoring of the characterological rigiditiesReich studied as an analyst—has heavily influenced a spate of therapeutic developments,including Alexander Lowen’s bio-energetics, Fritz Perls’s Gestalt therapy, Arthur Janov’s primaltherapy. And one of Reich’s dominant metaphors, that of “man in the trap,” the trap of his"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth16éditionsles atomes de l’âmeown armor, pervaded the therapeutic ambiance of the 1970s9.Reich also anticipated many recent social developments. During the 1920s and early1930s, he advocated the affirmation and social protection of healthy adolescent sexuality; thepublic availability, regardless of marital status or age, of contraceptives and abortion; the rightsof women to their own economic independence and assertiveness; and the existence of a“biological core” in the human structure that is spontaneously social and emotionally open,not driven by the compulsive accumulation of money and status. In the early 1930s, he estab-lished a relationship between personal emotional misery, on the one hand, and submissivenessto authoritarian political regimes, on the other. Later, in his concept of “work democracy,” hewas to focus on building social and economic interrelationships from practical tasks andhuman needs rather than from the external imposition of a political ideology.All these themes are very relevant today, often in forms quite different from whatReich was talking about, and some are still hotly contested. In subsequent chapters I shall arguethat very few of the above ideas are unique to Reich. What is unique is his concept of orgas-tic potency and the specific way he connected a series of psychological, social, and biologicalfindings with the presence or absence of this function.A friendly critic might grant the legitimacy of these views of Reich’s contributions.True, he might say, the earlier judgment of Reich “good psychoanalyst, bad everything else”was wrong, Reich did indeed contribute more to the clinical treatment of emotional problemsand to sociology than the psychoanalysts realized. However, all this had nothing to do with thework that was to preoccupy Reich and be most prized by him during the last seventeen yearsof his life: his research on orgone energy. Cannot this work be characterized as absurd primafacie? For example, his claim to have “harnessed” a life energy within a simple box he allegedwas helpful in the treatment of various illnesses? Is not this the reason why Reich is oftenregarded as a ludicrous, pathetic figure while those who utilize his psychiatric or sociologicalwork but do not “dabble” in science are taken more seriously? This revised view of Reich, making him more than a “good psychoanalyst” but nota serious scientist,has been adopted by many.Yet one must be skeptical of facile datings ofReich’s decline or glib explanations as to why he began to err. The image of him as sinister orinsane was beginning to emerge long before he ventured into experimental science. Even inthe 1920s when certain ofhis psychoanalytic contributions were applauded, colleaguesmocked him for his emphasis on “orgastic potency” as the goal of psychoanalytic treatment.In the late 1920s,many psychoanalysts and others considered him a psychopath or on theverge of psychosis, because he advocated adolescent sexuality and broke all kinds of laws inhis efforts to provide young people with sexological assistance (in the form of contraceptiveinformation, counseling, and so on). In the 1930s, many dismissed him as psychotic becausehe spoke and wrote about the healthy person’s perception of “streamings” in his body. Didnot schizophrenics also speak of experiencing “electric currents” in their bodies? The picture is further complicated by the fact that throughout his life Reich met withboth acclaim bordering on adulation and the severest criticism. Although a controversial fig-ure within psychoanalysis from the start, in the early 1920s many regarded him as “Freud’s"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1 : Introduction17éditionsles atomes de l’âmepet,” destined for a position of leadership within the psychoanalytic movement. When his rela-tions with his Viennese colleagues soured, he was able to surround himself in Berlin with anable group, including the analysts Otto Fenichel, Erich Fromm, and Edith Jacobson, whoshared his social-political concerns. After his expulsion from the analytic organization in 1934,he developed a new circle of talented psychiatrists, psychologists, and writers in Oslo, Norway.Reich had to leave Oslo in 1939 when his work on the bions (vesicles that he assert-ed represented transitional forms between the nonliving and the living) was denounced bymany Norwegian scientists and Reich was accused of the grossest scientific charlatanism.These controversies led to the loss of his Norwegian support but, once again, he was able toattract a new group—this time in New York. Defying established psychiatric and medical opin-ion, well-regarded psychiatrists such as Theodore P. Wolfe and Elsworth F. Baker devotedthemselves to learning and practicing Reich’s kind of therapy and to aiding his scientificresearch.In the 1940s, Reich’s writings made a deep impression on the thinking of several out-standing people who were later to be very influential; they included Alexander Lowen, FritzPerls, Paul Goodman, Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, and William Burroughs.Who exactly was this man whose life was filled with controversy, whom people lovedand hated,who had to flee five countries, who once was regarded by many as “Freud’s pet”but was excluded and hated by the psychoanalytic establishment? Why was he expelled fromthe Social Democratic Party in Vienna in 1929 and from the Communist Party in 1934, afterhaving been well regarded in both organizations? Why, in 1939, was he forced to leave Norwaydespite its tradition of civil liberties and after he had been so influential a teacher? Was it a signof dilettantism, madness, or Renaissance-type genius that his work involved so many fields—psychiatry, sociology, biology, physics, meteorology? And what forces—outer, inner, or both—led to his death in an American jail? When students were interested in Reich’s scientific work, he used to say: “Try to proveme wrong.” By this he meant that students should not take his theory and evidence on faith,but should scrupulously repeat the experiments with the most exact controls they could devise.Positive testimonials without firsthand critical investigation were as worthless, if not asdestructive, as uninformed attacks.My interest in Reich was and is primarily centered upon his work on human beings.Not trained as a biologist or physicist, I have never made systematic studies of his natural-sci-entific work.In writing this biography my first impulse was to concentrate on what I knew, notonly from firsthand experience in orgonomy but from related study in psychoanalysis and soci-ology.However, I have decided to cover the entire range of Reich’s work, although with farmore concentration on its contributions to human concerns than on its experimental aspects.For one thing, it seemed desirable to have the entire range of Reich’s work in a single volume,since only some ofhis writings are available today. Secondly, the fields with which I am mostconcerned—Reich’s psychiatric and social concepts and findings—were from 1934 on pro-foundly influenced by his natural-scientific work. Finally, in the period from 1948 to 1955,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth18éditionsles atomes de l’âmewhen I worked with Reich, he was deeply immersed in experimentation and I had the oppor-tunity to observe his methods of thinking and working at first hand. In order to render theseexperiences clearly, I have to give some picture of his experimental work. Although I have notmyself repeated many of Reich’s experiments, I hope to sharpen the questions that can beasked about his work, utilizing not only his own publications but also reports from and inter-views with those few well-trained scientists who have replicated these experiments carefully.A further restriction on the inclusiveness of this biography is imposed by the state ofthe Reich Archives. Reich’s will stated that his unpublished papers were to be “put away andstored for 50 years to secure their safety from destruction and falsification by anyone interest-ed in the falsification and destruction of historical truth.”10Reich designated his daughter,Eva Reich, M.D., the executrix of his estate. For reasons to be discussed later, Eva Reich in1959 appointed Mary Higgins as the executrix, a position she still maintains. Ms. Higgins hastaken a strict interpretation of the “50 years” clause, reading it to mean that the unpublishedpapers are not to be made available even to scholars.The inaccessibility of the archives, especially the diaries Reich kept from at least asearly as 1919 until the end of his life, is a serious loss for the biographer. Nonetheless, there issufficient evidence from a variety of sources, including interviews with people who knew himduring different phases of his life, to give a picture of his personality, private life, and innerdevelopment. With any great man, but particularly with someone like Reich, character struc-ture and work are closely interrelated, Reich himself often alluded to this relationship, as whenhe wrote: “The deeper the problem [of research] lies and the more comprehensive it is, themore intimately it is interwoven with the history of him who represents it.”11One of my chief concerns is with that “interwovenness,” as he put it. The misusesof this approach are manifold. A very common one, frequently criticized but often commit-ted, is psychoanalytic reductionism. One postulates a flaw or overemphasis in a person’s workand then “explains” it on the basis of a personality conflict, Thus, Charles Rycroft has linkedReich’s “idealization”of the orgasm with the “tragedies of his ... childhood,”12This kind of argument is demeaning. It requires the acceptance of the original,unsupported premise that Reich did in fact “idealize” the orgasm. It leaves unexplained whyothers who suffered from similar childhood tragedies did not make of them what Reich did.John Mack has commented well on this kind of approach in the context of his biography ofT.E.Lawrence:When I presented “psychological material” about Lawrence at conferencesor meetings, my audience would inevitably offer interpretations about his psy-chopathology which, however accurate they may have been, left me always feelingthat they had not seen Lawrence as I knew him to have been. In reading other psy-chological studies ofhistorical figures I found myself becoming impatient with thefailure of their authors to come to grips with the salient fact of unusual accomplish-ment,and kept registering the same objection that Lawrence himself had made whenhe commented upon a biographical essay about a famous general: that the article “left"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"1 : Introduction19éditionsles atomes de l’âmeout of him his greatness—an extraordinary fellow he was.”13Reich was initially a psychoanalyst. We permit the artist his severe emotional prob-lems and his wilder moments without denigrating his work. Erik Erikson has demonstratedhow historical figures such as Martin Luther and Mahatma Gandhi can be seen in their whole-ness, including their pathology, without demeaning their spiritual innovations14.Unfortunately, the fiction exists that psychoanalysts who have “completed their training” mustbe “well-adjusted” persons, who have “worked through” their unconscious conflicts. Whenthey are presented otherwise, as in Erich Fromm’s biography of Freud15, it is usually with theintention of denigrating them. Fromm’s form of maligning Freud was mild, however, com-pared to what classical Freudians can offer in the way of psychiatric slander when confrontedby theorists with differing views. It is ironic and disturbing that members of the very disciplinethat postulated no clear boundary between “normality” and “abnormality”, between the“crazy” and the “compact majority”, have so readily dismissed as “psychotic” such persons asJacob Moreno (the founder of psychodrama), Sandor Ferenczi in his last years, and R. D.Laing, all of whom strongly diverged from classical analytic theory or technique.But in no instance has the use ofpsychiatric diagnosis been as relentless or destruc-tive as in Reich’s case. During his career, rumors weie rife that he had been hospitalized formental illness, though in fact he never was. The accusation of madness—for that is what itamounted to—became a malignant legitimization for denying any aspects of Reich’s work onedid not like. By dating the onset of psychosis, one could neatly split Reich into a “good” pre-psychotic personage and a “bad” post-psychotic object. Depending upon one’s predilections,the date of illness would vary. Thus, psychoanalysts could see Reich’s character-analytic workin the 1920s as a product ofhis sane period,with everything after that viewed as psychotic.Some political radicals have pinpointed the illness as occurring in the mid-1930s, thereby per-mitting his Marxist-oriented, mass-psychological work of the early 1930s to be consideredsane.The problem is further complicated when Reich became a laboratory scientist. If ascientist’s work is valued for its discoveries, we are inclined to disregard whatever pathologicalconflicts a Newton or Einstein manifested. Generally speaking, we are as eager to banish con-sideration of the relationship between personality and “objective,” scientific accomplishmentas we are to include it in dealing with the “subjective” work of artists. One may consider theconnections between Dostoevski’s attitude toward his father and The Brothers Karamazov, butEinstein’s relationship with his father presumably has nothing to do with the theory of relativ-ity. This attitude in part reflects our idealization of “emotion-free” science. One does not lookfor impure things in dealing with the cleanliness of “pure research.” When, as in the case ofReich, a relationship between personality and scientific work is proposed, it is usually for thepurpose ofridicule.Reich, the scientist, becomes a movie Frankenstein, a madman with a delu-sionary system involving the “creation of life” in his laboratory. Reich’s capacity to cross sci-entific boundaries and to see common elements in apparently disparate realms is itself seen asa symptom ofinsanity;anyone who claims to work as a psychiatrist, cancer researcher, biolo-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth20éditionsles atomes de l’âmegist, and physicist must be mad.Nor do we do justice to Reich and his achievements, or to the connections betweenhis personality and his work, if we obliterate the problematical elements of his character.There are indeed those among his followers who can brook no association of Reich withsevere emotional conflicts. They have heard for so long the accusation that Reich was psychot-ic, and experienced with such pain this attempt to dismiss his work, that they refuse to exam-ine any pathological tendencies in Reich. Often, part of their motivation is to avoid providingammunition for his enemies. Here his followers are akin to those who, in the backlash againstpsychoanalytic reductionism, eliminate psychodynamics altogether in dealing with admiredpersons.Reich himself did not entirely disregard the relationship between his inner strugglesand his achievements, although frequently he wrote and spoke only indirectly about this “inter-wovenness”. His first published article was a disguised self-analysis16. There are importantsimilarities between his self-analysis and his description a few years later of the “impulsivecharacter”17. His awareness of his own problems contributed to his elucidation of authori-tarianism and the “emotional plague”, just as his perception of his own emotional health wascrucial to his formulations concerning the “genital character” and “orgastic potency”.In a more general sense, Reich by no means wished to exclude character structure indealing with competing scientific and philosophic “world pictures,” even though he insistedthat the finalcriterion in evaluating a clinical, social, or scientific finding was its objective valid-ity. I will explore in further detail Reich’s investigation of the relationship between theresearcher’s approach to “the problem” and his personality. My chief point here is to under-score hispreoccupation with the question. As a psychoanalyst, he learned from Freud theimportance of the therapist’s overcoming his own repressions in order to “see” and deal sen-sitively with those of his patients. Later, he expanded the analytic emphasis on self-knowingto include full self-experiencing.18Still later, Reich stressed that the emotional, energetic open-ness ofthe observer,the “cleanliness of his sensory apparatus” was a key prerequisite forstudying basic natural phenomena outside as well as inside every individual19.I will argue that throughout his career, Reich struggled not only to master his uncon-scious in the Freudian sense but to maintain contact in the Reichian sense with the core of hisbeing. I will contend that Reich’s neurotic problems—and he had many—often creativelyinteracted with his emotional depth and soaring intellect. At other times, the interaction wasdestructive. On some occasions—during his Marxist political work in pre-Hitlerian Europe,say,or his efforts to combat the Food and Drug Administration’s investigation in the 1950s—the interaction yielded a complex mixture of creativity and major errors. Such interactionsembodied in so protean a figure provide lessons, writ large, for all of us who, in our own fash-ion,struggle with the same dialectic of health and illness.I shall also apply Reich’s concern with the interpenetration of self and society, indi-vidual character structure and social structure, toward understanding how his own struggle tofurther his health and master his sickness developed and evolved within particular familial,social,and historical matrices.What I will call the “core Reich” his inner depth interacted with"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"1 : Introduction21éditionsles atomes de l’âmeexternal influences in ways which enriched and focused that depth and in ways which sulliedand distorted it. What was true for Reich is true for all of us. To quote the psychologist DanielJ. Levinson: “Every man’s life gives evidence of his society’s wisdom and integration as well asits conflicts, oppression and destructiveness.”20In dynamic interplay with the inner Reich, then, stood the “historical Reich”, the manwho embodied many characteristics of the authoritarian society he so sharply and brilliantlyilluminated. What was remarkable about Reich was not only his capacity to try to overcomethe ways he had internalized his society’s “conflicts, oppression and destructiveness”, but alsothe way that the core Reich often creatively utilized the destructive internalizations containedin the historical Reich. For example, Reich at times was able to employ an enormous compet-itiveness, pride, even an arrogance very similar to his father’s, as well as the vicissitudes of hisown Oedipal strivings, in order to protect and fight for the insights his more modest, innocent,and deeper self had discovered.No man, then, was more a child of his particular era; no man more engaged—alwayspassionately, sometimes bullyingly—in the social and scientific conflicts of his time. No manwas more able to transcend the destructive and erroneous in his social inheritance, to keep intouch with a depth of nature his times knew little of. To do so required relentless effort. InNietzsche’s words: “The great man fights the elements in his time that hinder his own great-ness, in other words his own freedom and sincerity.” Reich fought just such a battle with hisage.Through this struggle he finally saw—and saw with blinding clarity—that he had dis-turbed the sleep of the world more fundamentally even than Freud or Marx had done.Although his achievement was inconceivable without their precepts, he realized that he haddisturbed the world not through additions to existing systems of thought but through his ownunique perspective, the perspective of basic nature that the core Reich reflected. At last hecould distinguish this perspective by means of his struggle, never complete but yet successful,to liberate his natural core self from the dual armor of neurotic bonds inherited from his per-sonal life history and erroneous concepts inherited from his scientific environment.What should our attitude be toward the emotional life of a man like Reich? As I havesuggested, nothing is easier than to distance ourselves from great figures, whether through anegative interpretation or through idealization. Denigration and idealization are twins with thesame basic motive: to avoid taking responsibility for the discoveries before us and to avoid tak-ing responsibility for emulating the lives of great individuals. If we find severe flaws in the per-sonality of the “genius”, we can look upon him as some kind of genetic freak, closely linkedto the madman, whose contributions were almost an incidental offshoot of his weird person-ality.Ifwe consider the great man a triumphant genius with a basically unflawed personality,we can make small demands upon ourselves since we lack genius and possess flaws. Still anoth-er way of dealing with the great man is simply through indifference. One explains his loneli-ness and suffering through the kind of clichés Reich hated: “A genius is always one hundredyears ahead ofhis time”,or, “A genius always meets opposition in his lifetime”.The need for distance from greatness is especially intense when we are dealing with"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth22éditionsles atomes de l’âmepersons who make the implicit demand: You must change your life if you are truly to under-stand what I have discovered. In his biography of Gandhi, Erik Erikson has commented verywell on the various ways of neutralizing such innovators:I, for one, have rarely met anybody of whatever level of erudition or information, inIndia or elsewhere, who was not willing and eager to convey to me the whole meas-ure of the Mahatma as based on one sublime or scandalous bit of hearsay. And someformulas sanctify him in a manner which dispose of a true man just as totally as dothe formulas which define him by what he was not not a saint or not a statesman, nota true Indian or not a literate man... .It is as though a man had passed by who simply madetoo great demands on all as well as himself and must, therefore, be disposed of somehow. Thus, thefuneral pyre which consumed his remains to ashes often seems to be an elemental actof piety and charity compared to the totem meal by which his memory is now beingdevoured by friends and adversaries alike; many feed on him, deriving pride from hav-ing owned him, from having intelligently disposed of him, or from being able to clas-sify the lifeless pieces. But nobody thereby inherits ... what held him together andwhat gave him and through him, millions a special kind of vitalizing aliveness whichdoes not seem expendable in this world. (Italics mine.)21Even a balanced biography of Reich, one that would neither glorify nor demean theman, would “intelligently dispose” of him. Psychobiographies in particular can isolate the mes-sage of a great person’s work and life. It is all too easy to segregate him from the rest of ourlives, in the manner of Sundays-only religion. We can admire the great man and see how hisachievements reflected the rich texture of his health and illness. Yet we still avoid the fullmeaning of his life for us.My aim is to overcome this separation of the extraordinary individual from the restof us. I find it ironic that psychobiographers so intent upon relating a great man’s life to hiswork rarely give specifics about the relation of their lives to their biographies. Usually theyoffer a quite general statement of interest and attitude, with some caveats about possible bias-es toward their subject. They leave aside the details of their own involvement with the personthey are portraying, usually on the grounds that the reader is interested in the life of the greatindividual, not the life of the biographer. In so doing, they behave in a way analogous to thetherapist who refuses to disclose much about his or her own feelings and experiences on thegrounds that “here—in therapy—we are dealing with yourproblems, not mine”.This will not do. Just as the therapist sees the patient through the prism of his ownpersonality and experiences, just as Reich brought all of his being to his work in a way that thereader needs to know, so I shall bring all of myself to writing about him. Since you, the read-er, will be seeing Reich through my eyes as well as your own, it is important for you to knowwho I am.This approach is essential not only so that we can try to make explicit the possiblesources of distortion in our evaluation, but also so that we you and I can apply more effec-"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"1 : Introduction23éditionsles atomes de l’âmetively the lessons of Reich’s life in living our own. Primarily for these reasons, 1 intend to pres-ent in the next chapter an unusually full account of my own background and involvement withReich. I do not do this simply to help the reader watch for possible biases stemming from myten years of association with Reich as student, patient, and assistant, and from the kind oftransference I had toward him. This is important, but it is only part of the story. For as withReich, and as with you, my biases are inextricably interwoven with my emotions and my talent.In my understanding Reich and your comprehending him, everything must rest as it did withReich upon what emerges from the interaction between clear and tainted perceptions, uponwhat emerges from the struggle to see and experience the truth about Reich and about our-selves, free of denigration or idealization.People often ask why there are so few “objective” studies of Reich and his work bya writer neither strongly for nor against him. They also assume more objectivity on the part ofthose who did not know him. Although it has merit, this approach contains major oversimpli-fications. It assumes the possibility of a calm objectivity toward a man whose work is pro-foundly subversive to much in our usual thinking and feeling about ourselves and the world.Reich and his work touch people with peculiar intensity, whether they knew him or not,whether they are favorably or unfavorably disposed toward the man and his assertions. We cantry to overcome the neurotic distortions of even our deep and honest assessments. However,some elements working toward distortion will remain as they remained in Reich. We can onlyhope to achieve what he achieved: sufficient contact with the core of ourselves so that someof the time at least we can transform our conflicts and permit them to further rather than toimpede the quest for truth.Biographies of Reich as well as commentaries on his work present the danger thatboth man and work will be seen through a series of distorting mirrors. As I have made clear,distortion is as destructive in the form of deification as it is in slander. To quote James Agee:“Every fury on earth has been absorbed in time, as art, or as religion, or as authority in oneform or another. The deadliest blow the enemy of the human soul can strike is to do furyhonor... . Official acceptance is the one unmistakable symptom that salvation is beaten again,and is the one surest sign offatal misunderstanding, and is the kiss of Judas.”22Reich was well aware that he was a “fury on earth” and of the fate meted out to suchfuries.Indeed,this very problem preoccupied him during the last years of his life the dangerof his work being transformed into the opposite of what it was intended to be, as he believedhad happened to Christianity,Marxism,and psychoanalysis. It was the fear of distortion thatled him to specify in his will that his archives should be “stored” for fifty years after his death.But Reich also had a strong desire for honest scholarship, a wish that caused him inthe last years, when he was virtually alone at Orgonon, to spend considerable effort arrangingin clear order all the documents concerning his life and work. He often said that he himselfwas too involved in the events to write the history of orgonomy with sufficient detachment.What he could do was make the evidence available for others.Reich’s hopes have as clear a basis as his fears. For if there is the image of distortingmirrors, there is also the metaphor of the relay race. Great men can hand the torch on and it"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth24éditionsles atomes de l’âmecan then be carried further without having to wait for the next “genius” to continue the lineof development.Whether we do so or not depends a good deal on our “attitude toward greatness.”23It depends upon whether we can cease to isolate exceptional individuals by defamation, glori-fication, or even the kind of accuracy that studies only their depth, their talent, their psy-chopathology, and the outcome of their struggle with competing inner forces, all the whileneglecting these same issues within ourselves. There is much to unite us with great individu-als, especially our common emotional depth and the effort we can make as they made to freeit from distortion. In his address to the “Little Man”, Reich made this point forcefully:You [the little man] are different from the really great man in only one thing: the greatman, at one time, also was a very little man, but he developed oneimportant ability:he learned to see where he was small in his thinking and action. Under the pressureof some task which was dear to him he learned better and better to sense the threatthat came from his smallness and pettiness.The great man, then, knows when and in whathe is a little man. The little man does not know that he is little, and he is afraid of knowing it. 24 Reich here is stating an unconventional truth about how great men differ from therest of us, a truth that helps to lessen the pernicious distance established between extraordi-nary individuals and other people. But Reich gives only part of the truth. Knowledge of ourlittleness can pave the way to removing the various methods by which we dispose of great menand their work. Used positively, it can help us to give a real response to their contributions.However, the distance between “them” and “us” consists of more than their awareness oftheir smallness and our denial of ours. It takes a rare combination of emotional depth,courage, and penetrating intellect to make the great leap forward in human awareness. The crit-ic George Steiner has beautifully appreciated the right kind of distance one should feel towardindividuals like Reich, a distance I shall do my best to maintain in dealing with his life and work:Where criticism and scholarship invoke instances of the reach of a Shakespeare ... ora Pushkin, they have to exhibit imperatives of delicacy. They must reflect at everypoint ofstyle and proposal their sense ofthe relevant dimensions. They must fallshort of their object, but do so by a distance of incomplete perceptionso honestly definedthat the object is left at once clarified and intact.The inner lives of Shakespeare andMichelangelo are our heritage;we feed our smaller sensibilities on their donations and excess.There can be no other thanks than extreme precision, than the patient, provisional,always inadequate attempt to get each case right, to map its commanding wealth.(Italics mine.)25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"25éditionsles atomes de l’âme2 : My Relationship with ReichI first met Wilhelm Reich in December 1944. Eighteen at the time, I had studiedfor just a few months at the University of Chicago and was due to go into military servicein a week or so. The only works of Reich then available in English were The Function of theOrgasmand several volumes of a quarterly journal. Relatively few people, perhaps severalhundred, were familiar with his work in the United States. The standard psychiatric opinionof Reich was well reflected by the title of Martin Grotjahn’s review in 1943 ofThe Function:“Nuttier Than a Fruitcake.”Most students and teachers at the University of Chicago knew nothing of Reich.But from my readings of what had appeared in English, I was full of enthusiasm and excite-ment.His whole syndrome ofideas appealed strongly to me: the concept of a deeper, morejoyous sensuality; the affirmation of adolescent love life; the linking of sexual freedom witha nonauthoritarian social order; the relationship between emotional suppression and eco-nomic exploitation of submissive, “unalive” workers; the sense that “unarmored” man couldexperience a more vital existence; a psychiatric therapy that dealt not only with psychologi-cal complexes but also with bodily rigidities; even the notion of a universal energy identicalto the energy that moved in sexual excitation. I found it all intoxicating.To a somewhat confused, vaguely radical, sexually yearning young man it wasindeed heady stuff. I had found what I wanted to do in life—I wanted to be “in orgonomy,”as Reich termed his science, to help Reich in his struggles against a malignant world. Thefact that he had moved from country to country, persecuted for his beliefs, was all the moreenthralling.Here was a hero worth emulating, worth supporting. Here was a vision thatinvolved no “compromise,” no petty specialization in rat psychology or the trade-unionmovement ofthe nineteenth century.One could enlist in no less than the service of lifeagainst death. Little did I realize then how complicated such a service was to be, how farremoved from it I was, or how many difficulties there were to be both on my side and onReich’s.With the intention of preparing myself, I requested an interview with Reich, andthis was surprisingly easily arranged. However, when the time came I was in such a state ofnervous apprehension that I was twenty minutes late getting to his home in Forest Hills,about half an hour’s ride from New York City. Even in my haste and confusion, I remem-ber being surprised by the ordinary, “bourgeois” appearance of the three-story brick house.I was struck by the idea ofReich carrying out his “cosmic” work in so unpretentious a set-ting; it might as well have been the home of a moderately successful lawyer or businessman."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth26éditionsles atomes de l’âmeA young assistant greeted me, and said that “Dr. Reich” was waiting for me in hisbasement laboratory. So I went downstairs. I dimly recall many laboratory instruments anddevices but was too dazed to note them at the time.Most striking initially was Reich’s appearance. I had expected an academic, profes-sorial-looking person, but the only thing about him typically “scientific” was a white labora-tory coat. Otherwise, there was an earthy, almost peasant look to his face. He was ruddy-looking a redness I later learned was partly due to a skin condition he had long sufferedfrom. His dark brown eyes were mobile and sparkling, reflecting interest and amusement,impatience and friendliness. His smile was unusually open and warm as he reassured mewhile I apologized for being late.This description does not do justice to a certain quality of suffering in his face. Itwas nothing obvious. He did not look at all depressed, nor did he put on any airs; on thecontrary, he was remarkably simple and matter-of-fact. But his face looked scarred, asthough he had experienced considerable turmoil, and the shock of white hair combinedwith his expression gave the appearance of a man much older than forty-seven. Twentyyears later I would gain some real understanding of the personal tragedies as well as the sci-entific struggles that had already left their marks on Reich at this point.He seemed tall to me (in fact,he was 5 feet 10 inches) and there was considerablephysical strength in the oaklike frame, combined with a supple quality. The impression oflargeness was intensified by his weight. Since 1940 he had acquired a distinct potbelly.Reich asked me how I “got here.” I was muttering something about a taxi when heinterrupted impatiently: “No, no, no ... I mean how did you find out about me?” When Imentioned that my mother had told me about his books, Reich looked down and his mouthfell open, the expression resembling that of a disappointed child. He simply said “Oh,” in acrestfallen way, as though he had expected I had heard about him from a more academic orprofessional source.Next he asked:“Are you healthy?” I remember being surprised by the question,although he asked it in a matter-of-fact way, as one might say, “How are you?” but with realinterest in the answer,I was familiar enough with his writings to know that he was not refer-ring to my everyday health, but was talking about my “genital health,” my “orgastic poten-cy.”Being fairly inexperienced at the time (as well as inhibited), I replied in an embarrassedway that I didn’t know whether I was healthy or not. He tactfully dropped the subject.One of my special concerns was the sexual problems of other students at theUniversity of Chicago. I raised the subject of how “sick” other people were, prepared to goon at length, but Reich interrupted again: “I know, I know ... I spent much time with youthin Austria and Germany.Someone should pick up that kind of work again, I am entirely innatural science now.” Typically, he was not interested in prolonged descriptions of issueswith which he was already familiar or thought he was familiar.During my stay in Chicago, I had read Korzybski’s Science and Sanity,a book on gen-eral semantics that was causing quite a stir at the time,though one no longer hears muchabout it today. I told Reich I thought there were many similarities between his “theories” and"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich27éditionsles atomes de l’âmeKorzybski’s. His reply came succinctly: “This isn’t a ‘theory.’ The orgone is burningin the airand in the soil.” He illustrated the “burning” by rubbing his fingers together and gesturedtoward his laboratory instruments to indicate the concreteness of his work. (I was later tobecome familiar with Reich’s rubbing his fingers together whenever he wished to demon-strate something quite realistic as opposed to “words” or “theories” unsupported by facts.) When I raised the practical issue of how I should go about preparing for work inorgonomy, Reich surprised me by questioning the whole idea. He would advise me, he said,“not to go into the work, it is too dangerous, there is too much opposition, the work is verydifficult.” Of course, this kind of warning only increased my zeal.We talked for half an hour or so. Soon after I had gone upstairs, he followed, stoodin the doorway, and asked his assistant to record my name and address in his files. I was verypleased that he had taken this step. Perhaps he would permit me after all to enter this “dan-gerous” field. I remember staring, full of admiration, as he stood there in the doorway. Henoticed my stare, then assumed a “back to work” expression and returned to the basement.Later he commented that he had recognized the mystical, religious look in my eyes, the“burning eyes” he had seen so many times when people first made contact with him and hiswork. That same adoration, he was to say later, would often turn to hatred when the long-ing to be “saved”by Reich was disappointed.At the time I knew nothing of all this. I only wanted to help, as I thought. And Ileft his house exhilarated—I would convince him of my suitability. Meanwhile, I would usemy Army time, my work with death, to prepare for the future: for work with life, with Reich,with “orgastic potency” and “orgone energy,” no matter what the “armored” peoplethought or however much they scorned these most important truths.I have not yet made clear why Reich meant so much to me. Let me do so, first, bygiving some of the relevant events from my background, then making explicit their connec-tion to my interest in Reich.It all began with my mother.In 1931,when she was twenty-six and I was five, mymother had a psychotic breakdown. She never fully recovered, although when not understress she could function fairly well.In any case, children cannot comprehend madness in aparent.For me she was an extremely perceptive, erratic, and magnetic person. As a child Iworshipped her, was dependent on her, and enjoyed making her happy. Retrospectively, Iknow that somewhere I also felt exploited by her, as she dragged me into one or another ofher obsessions while I often yearned for a more normal life.Let me speak ofher obsessions.The first and most enduring one concerned her“dream,” as she called it. The dream occurred during her psychiatric hospitalization, whichlasted two years. The main themes of her psychosis involved an apocalyptic destruction ofthe “present order” (capitalism) through a big war, from the ashes of which a “new order”would emerge that was economically Communist and psychologically “free.”Certain aspects of my mother’s dream were elastic. She would incorporate current"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth28éditionsles atomes de l’âmepolitical events to give more up-to-date, factual body to the drama of the dream. But onenever-changing detail concerned the mechanism through which immortality was achieved.Immortal life resulted from scientific study of the orgasm. More precisely, it resulted froman “experiment” on sexual intercourse (masturbation would also suffice), in which a “chem-ical in the blood” was “isolated” during the “acme of orgastic experience.”I put my mother’s phrases in quotes because she used them, or ones similar, in theletters she wrote to people like A. A. Brill (the first English translator of Freud) and AlfredKinsey. Sometimes she managed to have interviews with these people, who were intriguedby her letters. I remember her vividly imitating Brill, then in his seventies, as he humorous-ly made clear that he was “too old” to participate directly in any experiment.My father disliked hearing my mother relate her dream at almost every social occa-sion; I also did, since children dislike being different. It violated his sense of propriety, whichwas as strong as my mother’s zeal to bate the bourgeoisie. Bora around the turn of the cen-tury into a poor immigrant family, my father sold newspapers as a child, worked hard, andby the age of twenty-seven, the time of his marriage, was well launched on what wouldbecome a successful business career. Seven years older than my mother, he had been attract-ed to her greater emotional freedom, she to his sense of responsibility. As I entered adoles-cence,my problems vis-à-vis my mother’s dream were compounded. What was confusing tome was that she entwined within its eccentricity many ideas that were genuinely innovativeand that I liked. For example, education in her new world was based on A. S. Neill’s books.Few people in Brookline (the suburb of Boston where we lived) were reading Neill in thosedays. My mother had most of Freud’s writings as well as many books on psychosomaticmedicine. Everything that seemed to combine radical political change with psychologicallyoriented programs was exciting to her and she would track it down.One part of my mother’s dream that disturbed me was that under the “new order,”she would be in charge of things. In a phrase she liked, she would be the world’s “benevo-lent dictator.” She would have a scientist as her right-hand man, who would take care of theorgasm “experiment” and other detailed work. I dimly felt that the role of benevolent dic-tator would give her on a global scale the kind ofpower she exercised, not so benevolently,in our home,where my father would usually defer to her wishes in order to avoid “scenes.”(Nonetheless,there was always a bond of warmth and support between my father and me,a bond I feared to develop lest I anger my mother.) When my mother obtained a copy ofThe Function of the Orgasmin 1943 (I was thenseventeen),she was certain she had found her scientist, and she met Reich in person short-ly thereafter. While he was not particularly impressed by her “experiment,” he enjoyed talk-ing with her.Later,he told me she had the kind ofschizoid mind he liked; in fact, my moth-er exemplified several of Reich’s concepts. Thus he wrote a good deal about how the schiz-ophrenic perceived a deeper reality than most neurotics, but lacked the capacity to develophis or her insights.Similarly, persons with the kind of mystical attitude my mother hadtoward his work could easily become “freedom-peddlers” his term for those who irrespon-sibly advocated his ideas without implementing them effectively."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich29éditionsles atomes de l’âmeIn her turn, my mother was impressed by Reich but also put him down. He was a“peasant,” she said. She felt he was not happily married and that he himself suffered from“sexual stasis,” a condition he wrote a good deal about. She clearly thought he would bemuch happier with her, that he desired her but was “afraid” of her. Still, it was with a sig-nificant look that she gave me The Functionto read, as though it provided the ultimate con-firmation of her dream.I read it with great enthusiasm for a different reason. Reich seemed to be talkingabout the same terrain the orgasm as my mother, but in a far more realistic way. I had alwaystried to bridge the gap between my mother’s imagination and my father’s practicality, triedto give a sounder cast to her wilder notions. In my mind, at first quite dimly, the idea beganto form that in Reich I had a valuable mentor in this task, that he represented the synthesisbetween my mother’s penchant for the new and daring and my father’s feeling for reality andgenuine achievement. Also, it was not just Reich’s work, it was Reich himself—his example,his heroism, his manliness as I somehow gleaned it from his writings—that was importantto me.In the fall of 1944 1 attended the University of Chicago. There I fell in love, unhap-pily as it turned out. I studied Reich’s writings all the more intently in an effort to under-stand my own experience.I spent the Christmas vacation at home, prior to entering the U.S.Air Corps; it was then that my first interview with Reich took place. I remember lookingover family albums at the time and being struck by pictures of myself around four or five,how serious I looked but how genuinely happy when I smiled. I noticed that my expressionlater became harder, more remote and vague. I did not then connect this awareness withsomething Reich emphasized a great deal: how after the kind of sorrow (“heartbreak”, touse one of his favorite words) I experienced when my mother was hospitalized, one numbsoneself and ceases to feel strongly. Nor did I have any idea of the pain Reich himself expe-rienced in childhood in connection with his mother’s suffering.I noticed something else from the snapshots. Just as I looked better before sheentered the hospital, so too did my mother—slimmer, kinder, more beautiful, less embit-tered.However, only later could I dare to face just how radically her behavior changed afterhospitalization,how alternately seductive and brutal she could be. With Reich I was to expe-rience a similar kind ofalteration between extreme warmth and rage, though in his case thereasons for the change were more rational than any of my mother’s.As a child I took emotional-sexual life very seriously, “falling in love” around agefive with another five-year-old. This seriousness diminished in adolescence. Under theimpact of entangled feelings toward my mother, I became more evasive, frightened, guilty,and cynical in general and over sexuality in particular. At the same time, I yearned to recap-ture the lucidity and directness of my early childhood. Both my clarity and my confusionguided me toward Reich. I hoped he would disentangle the former from the latter.In January 1945, 1 welcomed the enforced discipline of military life as an opportu-nity to prepare myselffor work with Reich. I also read with an intensity I had never knownbefore or since. What added zest to the reading was that I was beginning to incorporate what"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth30éditionsles atomes de l’âmeI read into a kind of Reichian world view. I felt that through Reich I understood fully whatNietzsche meant when he wrote: “All the regulations of mankind are turned to the end thatthe intense sensation of life may be lost in continual distractions.”Since 1942, Reich had been publishing his quarterly,The International Journal of Sex-Economy and Orgone-Research. Then, in 1945,The Sexual Revolutionand Character Analysisbothappeared in English. I waited breathlessly for these publications, and my reading of Reichwas now more systemic and intense. Above all, working hard and living simply in the Army,I felt that I was practicing what Reich wrote about and was less caught up with my mother’sfantasies. Still, I experienced great gratitude toward her for putting me in touch with this“new world.”The war ended in August 1945, but I was not discharged for another year. On a fur-lough I saw Reich a second time. My plan was to move to New York as soon as I was dis-charged, work for him, and go to school at night. He advised me to get my college degreefirst. I said there was so little time, thinking of the social revolution I believed to be immi-nent. I would help to bring about radical change, a kind of Lenin to his Marx. (Later, whenI related this to him, he asked ironically: “And who will be Stalin?”) So I was surprised whenhe leisurely waved his arm; he did not seem to share my urgency. Around this time I appliedto Harvard and was accepted.During the same furlough I began to make contact with others who were interest-ed in “the work.” I met a woman I shall call Jane Gordon, Reich’s assistant and the youngperson I had seen during my initial visit. At that time I was keenly interested in having a rela-tionship with a girl who was in “the work.” Unfortunately, Jane was married, but she invit-ed me to come and meet her husband, Sam (as I will call him).When I visited them at their apartment, they were both cordial and we chatted asthey waxed their skis. I remember their offering me a drink. I didn’t accept—drinking wasneurotic, I thought—but they told me that the Southern Comfort had been a Christmaspresent from Reich. I was surprised that Reich did such mundane things as give presents ofwhiskey for Christmas.Jane offered me a cigarette. I explained that I thought “smoking dulled one’s sens-es.” She said spiritedly that “Dr. Reich” smoked a great deal and she didn’t know of anyonewith keener senses than he.I mulled that over. Sam talked about how he and Jane had livedtogether before getting married, something, he said, that Reich approved of. According toReich, if the relationship went well, sometimes people liked to have the marriage license tolook at on the wall.Here Sam imitated Reich imitating the person who felt proud of his mar-riage license on the wall.During the summer of1946,just before being discharged, I spent another furloughweek in Rangeley, Maine. The Gordons, with whom I had by now become friendly, wererunning a camp for children of parents interested in Reich’s work. Reich became angry atSam,thinking he was exploiting the connection through Jane in order to make money. Janewas very upset.I remember discussions with them in which I talked enthusiastically aboutReich’s work. Jane would say: “The work is one thing, the man another.”"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich31éditionsles atomes de l’âmeIn September, I took a room near Harvard. Originally I enrolled as a pre-med stu-dent with the vague idea of becoming an orgone therapist, as Reich called his therapy.However, since I was entirely unsuited to either physics or chemistry, I dropped both sub-jects after a few weeks. I did learn German with the express wish of reading Reich in theoriginal.In those days I worked hard on working, on noting what was in the way, what wasblocking me. Rainer Maria Rilke’s letters about Rodin’s mode of work were a constant inspi-ration. So was Reich, whose picture hung on my wall: he represented a “benevolent pres-ence,” to use Erik Erikson’s felicitous phrase. When my nerves were shattered through some“wasteful” experience or disagreeable talk with my mother, I would sink into the quietnessof my room, review in my mind the life and work of my hero, begin to work myself, andfeel at peace again.While anxious to have therapy with Reich, I also wished to be my own therapist, todo it myself. To this end I had enlisted a fellow student and friend whom I will call Jack, sothat we could practice therapy on each other. First, he lay down and I helped him breatheand express emotions. Then he would do the same with me. I would bring back informationas to how Reich carried out his therapy and we used it in our sessions. My visits every othermonth or so to New York to see people connected with the work were extremely important.There I did my “field research” on Reich the man and on his work, especially his therapy.Each time I arrived at Grand Central Station, I was in a high state of excitement. Istayed with a friend who lived in a cold-water flat on the East Side. A kindly, charming per-son, he was in therapy with Reich. He kept telling me how hard it was, how Reich kept work-ing on what was phony in his character. But hard as Reich sounded, he also appeared—inthis person’s account—a quite human therapist. While analyzing the patient’s affectations healso acknowledged his own pettiness—for example, how as a lieutenant in the AustrianArmy during World War I he had sometimes worn a captain’s insignia to impress girls onfurlough.I also liked Reich’s exchange with a female patient. He told her: “You have a mask.”The patient replied:“You have a mask, too, Dr. Reich.” He in turn said: “Yes, but the maskhasn’t me.“ That seemed a vivid way of distinguishing between a rigid, neurotic “characterarmor”and the more flexible armor of the healthy person, who can open up when hechooses to.Those were the stories I collected. I sought out people who had contact with Reichand then recorded what they told me, always looking for information that would help meand my friend in our self-therapy. And I tried to find out how Reich lived, apart from howhe practiced therapy.I kept regular notes under different headings: “PersonalDevelopment,” “Armor,” “Orgonomic Thinking,” “Men and Women.” My marks at the uni-versity were improving, as were my study habits.In the late spring of1947, my mother visited my room in Cambridge. I always felther presence there as quite alien.The room with its books and papers, its orgone accumu-lator standing in the corner, represented my defense against her. Her presence meant that"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth32éditionsles atomes de l’âmeshe had slipped through the defense. In a matter-of-fact way, she disclosed that she andJack were having an affair. It had been going on for a few weeks, but they had been wait-ing for an appropriate time to tell me. I must have looked stunned and hurt—at least thatwas the way I felt. She asked me why I looked “funny,” being quite perceptive. I stifled myresentment. Deeply ingrained within me was the “ideal” that one shouldn’t be “jealous”or “against” sexuality. Thus did I rationalize the double betrayal I felt—on her part andon Jack’s. The relevance of this incident to my understanding of Reich’s life will becomeapparent in Chapter 3.In September 1947, an educational conference was being held at the HamiltonSchool in Sheffield, Massachusetts, a school run by Eleanor and Alexander Hamilton, twoeducators who had studied with Reich. The star attraction was to be A. S. Neill, a formerpatient of Reich’s and by 1947 his close friend. At this conference I met a woman who atfirst did not particularly impress me, but as I talked with her more I became quite inter-ested. For one thing—and no small thing to my mind then—Grethe Hoff had been intherapy with Reich. She talked a lot, and I asked her a great deal, about her therapy withReich. She gave the impression—an accurate one, as it later turned out—that Reich likedher very much. He thought she was quite healthy, she said. She stressed how he couldempathize with her deepest sadnesses and longings.She said that when she exhaled inbreathing, she could feel the streamings of energy in her genitals and legs. This was some-thing Reich mentioned a good deal in connection with his therapy, but many patients Italked with never seemed to have experienced it. That she had done so impressed me con-siderably.I was aware—though I tried to fight off the awareness—that I was way over myhead in the relationship. I was twenty-one, Grethe twenty-four. I had barely had one rela-tionship with a woman, she had had many relationships before me. I had never been intherapy, she had been in therapy with Reich. Apart from what I associated with her, I wasnot at all sure that I wanted her. And it became clear after a short while that she not onlywanted me but a long-term relationship, something that deep down I knew I wasn’t readyfor with anyone.Yet at this point I was extremely vulnerable to anything posed as a“Reichian” challenge. One final factor that I was not at all conscious of at the time wasthat I was coming to Grethe Hoffon the “rebound” from my mother’s relationship withJack.During the fall of 1947, Grethe continued her social work study in New Yorkwhile I studied at Harvard, but by January 1948 she and I had begun living together inBoston. She had some concern that living with me unmarried would jeopardize her posi-tion legally since she was not a citizen ofthis country, and a lawyer we consulted height-ened our fears. Grethe was very much for marriage whereas I was lukewarm outwardly butin fact dead set against it inwardly. However, my mother strongly opposed it, so in demon-strating my freedom from her, I agreed to get married almost immediately. I did not knowthen,or admit to myself,that transferring tyrannies is no sign of freedom.Right around this time, Reich asked if I would translate a German manuscript of"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich33éditionsles atomes de l’âmehis. The manuscript consisted of material that was later published as a series entitled“Orgonomic Functionalism” in a quarterly Reich began bringing out in 1949.*I was very excited by the material and worked hard on the translation, but my rela-tionship with Reich had shifted now. Earlier, I never thought of getting anything directlyfrom him, except his approval. I really wanted to help the work, to be part of it. Yet nowhere I was, in one of Reich’s favorite phrases, “giving in order to get,” which was not in hiseyes or mine a very satisfactory way of giving. I wanted to “get” orgastic potency from him,or what he described as complete surrender in the sexual act. I did not know then that—again using his concepts—one does not “get” a full surrender, one gives it.In the summer of 1948, I arranged with Reich to work at Orgonon, his researchcenter. Now there was ample opportunity for regular meetings about problems of transla-tion. It was a pleasure to work with him. He was appreciative, generally willing to yield to abetter word or phrase when I suggested it, though he could be very adamant at times whenhe definitely preferred another choice. Always he emphasized sharpness and simplicity ofexpression; he wanted to “clean” (his word) his writing of all German academic phrases.I had another motive in translating for him—one that inspired me to work but alsoto rush the work. I wanted to impress him so that he would take me into therapy. On thisissue,he kept me at some distance. He warned that it was not a good idea for me to be intherapy with him at the same time that I was working for him. He suggested that I see anoth-er orgone therapist, but I strongly rejected the idea: I wanted therapy from him.About a month after I began working at Orgonon and after repeated requests,Reich agreed to see me in therapy. I was extremely pleased but also apprehensive. I no longerrecall the exact procedure around this therapy, although one certainly existed. I wouldundress completely and lie down on the couch, then Reich would come in from an adjoin-ing room. There was something very definite, marked off, about his entrances and exists.In the beginning the therapy went quite well. I was extremely impressed by the wayReich worked with my body. He would have me breathe and then keep pointing out the wayI avoided letting the breath expire naturally. Sometimes, he would press certain parts of mybody,particularly my chest. A few times this was followed by very deep sobbing, crying in away I could not remember ever having cried before. He would encourage me in an empath-ic way:“Don’t be ashamed ofit. I have heard it by the millions. That sorrow is the best thingin you.”He also kept calling attention to my “urgency,” my straining after things. He men-tioned that it came up in the laboratory often. It wasn’t “obnoxious,” he said, but it was inthe way. He advised me not to have so many “ideals” that I struggled after, but to “let ‘if doit”—by “it”meaning the energy within my body.The comments on my urgency were linked with the bodily work: “Let your air out.... Open your throat... . Don’t try to ‘get’ anything or have anything. That is the worst thingin you—your urgency, your wanting.”* All of these publications were subsequently burned by the FDA and to this date have not been reissued"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth34éditionsles atomes de l’âmeI found it hard to understand intellectually what he meant by “letting ‘if do itself,”but on another level, I knew what he meant. I would shiver to recall how in my lonely Armydays and first year at Harvard I could get into the swing of my work if I stayed with it longenough so that it was flowing and coming “by itself.” Now I was away from this mood, anddesperately eager to solve my sexual problems.I didn’t really tell Reich just how unhappy my marriage was, nor did he explore mygrowing negative feelings. When I complained that marriage and work didn’t go together, hewould answer that one didn’t have to be ascetic. And when I nostalgically told him how Iused to imagine him watching me as I studied intently in my room, he replied in a kindlyway: “You were in love with me. Give your genitality to your wife and your work to theOrgone Institute.” Once again, I felt the “mandate” to solve my difficult problem, that itwas my fault. And, indeed, I would put it that way to Reich. I rarely complained about mywife: making her sound quite attractive, I said I only wanted to be healthier with her.What really staggered me in therapy was experiencing what Reich called at varioustimes the “vegetative currents,” “bio-electric current,” and—by1949—“orgonotic stream-ings.” These currents were often particularly strong after intense sobbing. I would lie there,breathing more easily, and would feel this beautiful sweet, warm sensation of pleasure in mygenitals and legs.It was glorious, I had never felt anything like it. I had never read anythingabout it; with the exception of Grethe and a few other people, I had never heard anyonedescribe it. I knew there was much about Reich’s work that I didn’t understand. There wasa lot about the man that puzzled and disturbed me, but one thing I was never to doubt again:the sensation of those “currents.” If the scientific world had paid so little attention to thisphenomenon, perhaps the same held true for yet another. The same energy functioned inthe atmosphere, according to Reich, registering on his laboratory instruments, which I hadobserved but knew virtually nothing about.One of the problems was that the sensation of vegetative currents did not last long.From today’s perspective, I understand more fully what prevents their permanence. I canunderstand why Reich grew impatient with therapy —it was so difficult, people led suchcomplicated lives.Indeed,during one of my first meetings with him, he had advised me notto become a therapist: “You get caught up with people, you get involved in their lives. Whena tree has grown crooked, it will never be straight again. Prevention is what counts.”Reich himself was much less helpful in working with my psychological problemsthan with my bodily armor. He seemed not to be especially interested in examining my rela-tions with people (Grethe HofF,or my parents) in great detail except where these linked upwith a specific bodily issue, some way I had of blocking the sensations. If things weren’t toobad,he was often content to leave them alone,seeming to prefer that life and therapy notbe more complicated than necessary. For example, I told him in those early sessions aboutmy mother’s affair with Jack. He smiled in an almost embarrassed way, saying: “She should-n’t have done that.” But there was something in his manner that did not encourage my con-tinuing.Only much later did I recognize his reluctance to deal with this subject.Other conversations were bothering me. His explanation of the Sam incident was"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich35éditionsles atomes de l’âmenot fully satisfying. By the time I was in therapy with Reich, the situation with the Gordonshad deteriorated further. Sam had gone into therapy with one of Reich’s therapists, whoafter a while had been advised to terminate treatment. When I asked Reich for an explana-tion of this, his reply was: “He was discharged because he took part in an action against theHamilton School when he was toldnot to. We didn’t want him and that is our privilege.”Such an explanation was hardly satisfying. Discharging a person from treatmentseemed to me a very cruel thing to do, yet I was afraid to argue with Reich lest he kick meout for defending such a person. There was the clear sense that certain subjects were not tobe brought up, and Sam was one of them. Wanting to express some of my negative feelings,I made the infelicitous choice of Sam as my mouthpiece. Sam had reported, I said, thatReich had done such-and-such a thing wrongly. I shall never forget Reich’s towering rage.His voice boomed out, his skin reddened, he was all harshness. He denied the truth of theaccusation and was quite furious at me for reporting it. “If there is one thing I cannot stand,it is hearing that ‘so-and-so said.’ Don’t tell me what ‘so-and-so’ said!”Still, during that summer, the pace of events was more benign, even though I wouldoccasionally witness Reich’s rages in the laboratory.Much as I deplored Reich’s behavior toward Sam Gordon, I did admire his capaci-ty to take strong stands.Sometimes what I regarded as his naiveté was extremely deliberateand self-conscious behavior. For example, that summer he applied for research funds to theNational Science Foundation. When they asked for further information, he detailed in a let-ter how much money he actually put into research while most people just talked, and wenton in this vein. He seemed to catch from my undertone that I thought the letter would beill-received, for his comment was sharp: “We don’t care what people think. We are not writ-ing for anybody. That is a very important thing. We are supposed to be different. How arewe going to make others different if we become like them? If they can’t take it, then it istheir problem. It does no good to hide.”In many ways, being with Reich on an almost daily basis led to no disillusionment.Up close he was even more remarkable in the range of his capabilities. Socially he kept a dis-tance,but he was very open about what he felt, and he was very much himself with his smallson.I remained intrigued and puzzled by the man. Occasionally, in therapy, I asked ques-tions about his personal life and sometimes he would volunteer information. He was bothworried and Impressed that I was “terribly young” (that summer I turned twenty-two), butthen he was quick to point out that he had been even younger when he first came into con-tact with Freud.He could be contemptuous too about what he regarded as weakness ortimidity. He asked me when I started my sexual life and as I mentioned the (from his view-point) rather advanced age of nineteen, he looked a little disgusted. I once asked how hemanaged to remain “healthy,” and he replied that he had had a “remarkable mother,” but didnot elaborate.On another occasion,I wanted to find out what had led Reich to discover the mus-cular armor.Had he been armored himself? “No, no,” he answered. “I went out to people.I was open, then I met this wall—and I wanted to smash it.” Generally, Reich would not talk"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth36éditionsles atomes de l’âmeabout his own problems except in what might be described as an excess of virtue; for exam-ple, he had been too loyal to Freud and Marx. Yet one sensed problems in his background,one had the feeling that his life had been stormy.Much fascinated me about Reich, in particular that mixture of a very simple humanbeing prepared to do the simplest of tasks, and a grand, remote, lonely person acutely awareof his destiny, of who he was or at least thought he was. I recall his saying once, more tohimself than anyone else, “A person like me comes along once every thousand years.”One further paradox connected with Reich was that the people around him werejust ordinary people; they were not “unarmored,” “orgastically potent,” or anything else spe-cial. By and large, as loyal workers they tried to do their best. Often they parroted Reich andwere afraid to stand up to him. He in turn “used” them as much as they, in a different way,“used” him, to bask in his reflected glory, to have some sense of being part of great, expand-ing themes. People would work for him for nothing or for very little recompense. Heclaimed they were learning a lot, and so they were. He accepted, indeed asked for, consider-able financial help from his followers. When people dropped out of his close circle, it hurthim but he went on relentlessly, replacing defectors with new adherents.So there was Reich, this problematical person, and I was trying hard to understandhim,keeping notes on everything, including therapy. One night, late, I remember sitting inthe laboratory translating while he was working with his instruments. Half to me, half intothe night, he remarked: “When it is late and quiet and lonesome, then it is good. “ Sometimeson such nights, he would wear a revolver strapped to his waist. The combination of the gunand a bandana tied around his neck made him look like a guerrilla chieftain. He said: “Don’tthink I am peculiar because I wear a gun on my hip. You will learn about these things aftera while.”In the fall of 1948, Grethe and I returned to Boston, Reich to Forest Hills. I con-tinued working part time for him and also remained in therapy, commuting to New Yorkonce a week.In January 1949 I was graduated from Harvard, and Grethe from her socialwork school, so we moved to New York to facilitate my work and therapy with Reich.During the summer I again worked for Reich at Orgonon, though I took a break from ther-apy.Throughout this period the various strains with Reich increased. Soon after Iresumed therapy with him in the fall of 1949, my treatment, my work with him, and my mar-riage collapsed. I became acutely aware of many neurotic aspects to all three. I was also furi-ous at Reich for not having seen through my subconscious games of always presentingGrethe Hoffm a favorable light, myself in an unfavorable one. I was furious at his fury as atherapist toward me over the Gordon imbroglio. Now at last my “negative transference “ aconcept Reich heavily emphasized, fully erupted. Still, I was angry that I had to reach a stateof collapse before he could fully accept my hostile feelings.There were in addition depressed feelings about what I regarded as my failures bothas a patient and a worker.I was angry at Grethe, particularly for the pressure she had exert-ed for our legal marriage. The dream that I had clung to so ardently from my Army days of"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich37éditionsles atomes de l’âmeworking with Reich and being with a woman “in the work” had turned, to use ConradAiken’s description, “to darkness and darkness took my heart.”Separated from Grethe, terminating therapy, and resigning rny position, I wenthome for several months. Slowly my spirits revived. The revival was largely due to a letterfrom Reich assuring me that the door was always open for my return to orgonomy. Hebelieved, he wrote, that I was “running away” not from him or the work but from myself.His letter filled me with hope for the future. I had handed over to him all my previous work,including my “mistakes,” and he still wanted me to return: I had a second chance.In late May 1950, after a six-month hiatus, I returned to Orgonon, now simply towork with Reich without thought of being in therapy with him. I had the kind of apprecia-tion of life that only a convalescent after a long illness can feel. I remember the summer asgolden. Reich was in a very good mood active, expansive, human. I found it exhilarating tobe franker with him than I had ever been, and he appreciated my openness.During this period I started to keep more systematic notes about Reich and eventsat Orgonon. Carefully, I recorded much of what he said in the laboratory about science,social events, individuals. He had an unusually vivid and perceptive way of speaking, withfar more humor and irony than emerges from most of his writings. I was enchanted by therange and speed ofhis insights.I did not limit myself simply to recording what he said orwhat happened, but interpolated my own analysis and connections with insights of others.Reich deeply appreciated my writing and began to refer to me as the “historian” of orgon-omy, a role that fitted my own conception of myself.However, he insisted that he should keep my writings, and didn’t want me to havea copy. “That’s mine, “ he said, as he touched a pile of my pages. True, a lot of it was whathe had said. True, I could understand his concern that some of his latest, unpublished find-ings, recorded in the notes, would somehow be taken by others. (He always had a “passionfor priority.”) Still, the notes were my work, and I should have insisted at least on keeping acopy.I should have made it an issue of staying or leaving. But I couldn’t in part because Iwanted to be near him, I wanted to understand him. Now, like the rest of the sealed ReichArchives,my notes are not available to anyone except the current executrix of the estateuntil the year 2007.Thus, I was deprived of the opportunity Reich always said was mine: towork on the notes at Orgonon.By December 1950,I had achieved a position quite close to Reich. In addition tomy historical work, I had a variety of other responsibilities, such as editing the Orgone EnergyBulletin,Reich’s quarterly publication of the period. I did various kinds of public relationswork. I also took on some duties that I should have refused since I was not good at them.As Use Ollendorffhas noted,Reich was fierce when it came to financial matters. He want-ed every bill checked and often felt he was being cheated. I took on some shared responsi-bility with Use for the financial accounts and came to dread the monthly discussion of billswith Reich, In this realm there was a dangerous renewal of my old fear and evasivenesstoward him.Another, more ominous development also occurred that December: Grethe Hoff"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth38éditionsles atomes de l’âmemoved to Rangeley and we resumed our marriage. Once again the triangular, competitiveaspects of my relationship with Reich were ignited, though admittedly in less acute formthan when I had been in treatment. I gradually became more hidden and “poker-faced,” asReich termed it. The open, free-wheeling exchanges of the summer and fall of 1950 becamerarer. Reich in turn reacted to my evasiveness with outbursts of bitter anger, thereby creat-ing a vicious circle.In May 1952, Grethe and I left Orgonon. My explanation at the time for leavingwas that I wanted to continue graduate work in psychology and that my lack of scientifictraining hindered my usefulness now that the Oranur experiment (involving Reich’s work onthe poisoning of the atmosphere, to be discussed in detail in Chapter 27) was so much thecenter of the work at Orgonon. These reasons obtained, but of far greater importance wasthe deterioration of my relationship with Reich. I felt self-critical about this, but with muchless of the anguish experienced when I left in 1949. Also Reich’s rages, not only toward mebut toward others, were now far more severe. All these factors taken together led me tobecome emotionally “numb.” I left with relief.But only part of me left. Although I had given up a close working relationship withReich, I still viewed myself as historian of orgonomy. An essential part of me kept wonder-ing about this phenomenon:How had he become what he was, how much of what he didtouched on the truth? After leaving, I continued finding out about Reich, studying his work and interview-ing people about him. And I remained on sufficiently amicable terms that I could attendconferences at Orgonon, correspond with him, and be consulted by him about one thing oranother.However, orgonomy was no longer the sole focus in my life. In 1953 I enrolled inan interdisciplinary Ph.D. program at Harvard University, specializing in psychology andeducation. My most important experience during this period was working with Daniel J.Levinson on a research project at a small teaching psychiatric hospital affiliated withHarvard, the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. My research was on the personal andprofessional development ofpsychiatric residents and, for my doctoral dissertation, the fac-tors leading to “psychological-mindedness” as a personality attribute.1In the course ofthis work I had the opportunity to study “adult development,” inother words, the biographies of young psychiatrists, in a way that utilized both qualitativeand quantitative assessments. Like Reich, Levinson also focused on social and intrapsychicdeterminants of human functioning. My work during those years was to provide a valuablebackground for the task of writing Reich’s biography. However, since the core themes ofReich’s work vegetative currents, orgastic potency, orgone energy—were in ill repute in theacademia of the 19505, I tended to devalue what I was learning in the “establishment.” Mypassion was reserved for my extracurricular life—pursuing the role of orgonomic historian.Nor did I appreciate that I was treated by such mentors as Levinson and the research direc-tor ofthe hospital,Milton Greenblatt, with far more respect for my autonomy and creativ-ity than I had often been by Reich."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich39éditionsles atomes de l’âmeIn 1953, my wife and I had a son, Peter. In the summer of 1954, we attended a con-ference at Orgonon. At this time, unbeknown to me, Hoff and Reich expressed what I hadlong fantasized: a romantic interest in each other. That fall Grethe visited Rangeley, ostensi-bly to consult Reich about a medical problem, actually to begin a relationship with him. Itwas not long before she told me about it. Reich also phoned me. He emphasized the inde-pendence of my marriage and his relationship with Grethe. The marriage was not good andshould end, regardless of what happened between the two of them. Still, our marriagewould not have ended at this point had it not been for Reich’s reckless action. Our son hadbecome an important bond between us. Whatever the problems, we had consoled ourselvesthat our marriage was better than many; above all, I did not want to lose our infant son.At the same time, long dissatisfied with my marriage, I saw in the new developmentan opportunity to begin my personal life anew. This prospect did not mitigate my sense ofhurt and betrayal at the hands of Grethe and, especially, of Reich.Grethe, too, was experiencing conflict about actually ending the marriage and join-ing Reich, a step he urged with his usual importunity. Finally, in December, she joined him,taking Peter with her. The subsequent evolution of the relationship between Reich and Hoffis described in a later context. Here, to complete my personal involvement in the long-stand-ing triangle,two further incidents are significant.In June 1955, Grethe wanted to resume our marriage but I did not. By this time Ihad entered a new, more satisfying relationship. Still, I felt flattered and somehow “victori-ous” over Reich that she wanted to return.At a conscious level at least, Reich and HofPs relationship had in no way lessenedmy motivation to be an orgonomic historian. Indeed, in the late spring of that year I hadbegun working for Reich once more, now on a part-time basis from Boston with occasion-al visits to Rangeley. Yet the personal events had their impact on the relationship. In August,during a work discussion, Reich brought up his concern that Hoff was “running” from him.(“Running”was one of Reich’s favorite words—one “ran” from the depths, from strongfeeling, from truth.) He asked me in a quite open, human way whether she also “ran” whenshe was with me.I replied:“No, she had what she wanted.” Consciously, I meant that shehad a lifestyle with me she had liked, that she feared the challenge Reich represented.However,there was also undoubtedly an element of superiority to Reich in the remark: shepreferred me.In any case, Reich took it that way. I recall his looking very hurt and angry. For aperiod ofa month or so,he attacked me as he never had before —bitterly, relentlessly, oftenunfairly. Under this barrage I resigned my position. But it did not take long for our relation-ship to be sufficiently cordial that I once again began attending various meetings, now cen-tered on his legal battles with the Food and Drug Administration.I was still plagued by an intense sense of disparity between my commitment toorgonomy and my desire to pursue academic training. There was difficulty in completing myPh.D.dissertation,so in 1956 I went into psychoanalysis. I learned a great deal from analy-sis about my neurotic bondage to Reich. I learned far more than Reich had ever taught me"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth40éditionsles atomes de l’âmeabout what my parents had meant to me. I was able to complete my dissertation and involvemyself more actively in the “non-Reichian” world.However, whereas my analyst had a keen eye for all of Reich’s problems with meand mine with him, he seemed blind to Reich’s unique contributions and my appreciation ofthem. He behaved as though I were temporarily hallucinating when I talked about “thestreamings” of “orgone energy.” His lack of understanding in these matters added to mysense of disloyalty to Reich in being in analysis at all: analysts almost to a person believedthe “late Reich” was insane. My guilt was enhanced when in 1957 Reich died in prison whileI was on the couch analyzing my conflicts with him. But in another sense I did feel “loyal”to Reich (it has remained a continuous problem to be fundamentally loyal to myself) becauseI intended to make use of the analysis to fulfill my aim of understanding him and our rela-tionship.Between 1964 and 1975, 1 was on the faculty of Tufts Medical School, and engagedin research and education at Boston State Hospital, where Greenblatt was now superintend-ent. Here I had the opportunity to study closely different styles of leadership, a subject rel-evant to my later examination of Reich as a leader2. I also had the opportunity to learnmore about the practice of psychoanalytically oriented psychotherapy, the verbal side oftherapy, which Reich underemphasized.The movement toward healing my split between “Reich” and “the world” was fur-ther accelerated by social and therapeutic developments of the 1960s. The cultural revolu-tion of those years more affirmative attitudes toward sexuality, the “new left,” and the riseof “body therapies’ led to a more positive appraisal of Reich. True, many of the essentialsof his thought were still ignored, but he was no longer so readily dismissed as psychotic.Universities and hospitals as well as “counter-cultural” groups now invited me to give talkson his work.I did not identify myself as a “Reichian” therapist because I had never been trainedto be one, though it was clear that my therapeutic work was heavily influenced by Reich.Thus,with the growing interest in Reich, my practice evolved and became deeply satisfyingto me as a way ofmaking “real” at least some of what I had learned from Reich and as away of integrating into his concepts more insight-oriented techniques I had learned sinceleaving Reich.By 1975, I was in full-time private practice.Full-time except for one major commitment: in 1971, a publisher had asked me towrite a biography of Reich. I accepted with enthusiasm. I had no idea at the time that thetask would take me ten years. Part of that period was devoted to the actual task of researchand writing. A more considerable part was devoted to sifting out once again my own atti-tudes toward Reich’s work and person. Not only did I have to struggle to evaluate the sci-entific evidence, I had also to deal with what I had noted so often in myself and others, thetendency Reich described as “running” from deep emotions. Just as in treatment with him,the “streamings” could be the clearest reality one day and a distant memory the next, so inwriting about his work,periods ofappreciating the significance of his efforts alternated withtheir appearing as “unreal” as my mother’s “dream” of sex and immortality."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"2 : My Relationship with Reich41éditionsles atomes de l’âmeAs for Reich the man, in writing the book it took me a long time to begin to appre-ciate the magnitude of his duality across the span of his life the extraordinary mixture ofgreatness, pettiness, and vindictiveness just as earlier it had been hard for me to comprehendits expression in his relationship with me. I could not seriously confront him without under-standing my own duality. Conversely, without studying his work and personality, I doubt thatI could have begun to see the full extent of my own complexity. The problem has been wellexpressed by Leon Edel, the great biographer of Henry James:I am sure that if someone were to attempt to study the psychology of biographers,he would discover that they are usually impelled by deeply personal reasons to thewriting of a given life... . Another way of putting it might be to say that the biog-rapher must try to know himself before he seeks to know the life of another; andthis leads into a very pretty impasse, since there seems to be considerable evidencethat he is seeking to know the life of another in order better to understand him-self.3As Edel suggests, there is no complete way around this dilemma. A starting pointis to make the impasse as explicit as one can;this I have tried to do. I have also followedReich’s advice to me for historical work, “Don’t leave yourself out,” meaning that I shouldmake clear my own values, biases, emotions, and the like. But Reich, who could be profound-ly dialectic in his thought, gave me another, only seemingly contradictory bit of advice, “Bea fly on the wall,” meaning that I should leave my own ego out. To this end I have placedmy emotional-subjective involvement in Reich’s work and person here in this chapter, so thatI can turn now to a more systematic biography and do my best to be that “fly on the wall.”"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth42éditionsles atomes de l’âmePART IIThe Development of the Mission: 1897-1920"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"43éditionsles atomes de l’âme3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-1917Wilhelm Reich, son of Leon Reich and Cecilia (née Roniger), was born on March24, 1897, in the part of Galicia that then belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He wasundoubtedly born at home, the custom at that time and place. He once mentioned withsome pleasure to his daughter that his head had been massaged and molded after birth, inthe course of which there had been some sutures1.Soon after Reich’s birth his family moved to the small town of Jujinetz in northernBukovina, a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire named after the rich beech treesdominating the forested terrain. Reich’s father, Leon, had decided to become a partner ofhis wife’s uncle, Josef Blum, who owned an estate of two thousand acres. Leon graduallytook over sole control of the cattle farm on the land, while Blum went on to become amulti-millionaire in other enterprises2. A second son, Robert, was born to Leon and Ceciliain 1900.We know a good deal less about Reich’s mother than we do about his father. Onlynineteen at the time of Wilhelm’s birth, Cecilia appears from photographs to have been con-siderably younger than the father, though I could not determine his birth date. One familymember estimates that Leon was ten years older than his wife3.Reich always described hismother as “very beautiful,”though this is not apparent from the extant photo. It was clearthat he preferred her to his father, a much sterner, more authoritarian person. When theyoung analyst described his complex family dynamics in a disguised self-history, he wrote ofhis parents:He [Reich] was brought up very strictly by his father and always had to accomplishmore than other children in order to satisfy his father’s ambition. From his earliestchildhood,he had tenderly clung to his mother who protected him from the dailyoutbursts of the father. The parental marriage was not happy for the mother suf-fered horribly from the father’s jealousy. Even as a five- and six-year-old he had wit-nessed hateful scenes of jealousy on the father’s part, scenes which even culminat-ed in the father’s violence toward the mother. He took the mother’s side which isreadily understandable since he himself felt under the same whip as the mother andhe deeply loved her4.Later in the same article, he reported that Leon in his jealous rages would accusehis wife ofbeing a “whore.”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth44éditionsles atomes de l’âmeWith a few exceptions, Reich spoke positively about his mother throughout his life.Indeed, according to his third wife, Use Ollendorff, Reich idealized his mother, always cit-ing her cooking as a model that Use could not reach5.Reich’s view of his father, however, seems to have changed considerably over theyears. As a young man, he was quite critical of him. In several places in his writings he indi-rectly alluded to the father’s authoritarian ways, and used to speak bitterly about him tofriends. But toward the end of his life, Reich’s attitude softened, and without even mention-ing the more somber aspects, he highlighted Leon’s positive attributes. Reich took great sat-isfaction in the fact that his father was not religious, aside from some ritual Jewish obser-vances to appease more orthodox relatives; that Leon was cosmopolitan in orientation andmodern-minded in his farming practices; that he was a working property owner, not a “par-asite.” In later years Reich stressed that his mother, too, was very active on the family estate,a leader who helped organize the women’s work on the farm just as the father directed themen6.Reich’s feelings toward his father—both the critical ones of his youth and the morepositive later ones—are supported by his sister-in-law, Ottilie Reich Heifetz, whom I had thegood fortune to interview at length in 1971. In her seventies then, Ottilie had known Reich’sbrother Robert since 1915, and was his wife from 1922 until his death from tuberculosis in1926. She had met Wilhelm, or Willy, as he was always called in those days, when he was inVienna in 1917 on a furlough from the Army, and until 1930, they were good friends as wellas in-laws. In addition, Ottilie knew Reich’s maternal grandmother, another source of infor-mation about Reich’s family origin.Robert was as reluctant as Willy to speak much about his early family life, referringto it on several occasions as “unhappy.” But what he and the grandmother told Ottilie gen-erally confirms Reich’s account. Ottilie pictured the father as extremely clever, a vigorous,fascinating, and very dominating man, given to outbursts of temper. He appears to have hada highly possessive attitude toward his young wife that today would be termed male-chau-vinist.Ottilie recalls Robert relating how his father once hit Cecilia for not having the din-ner ready on time. His possessiveness is perhaps intimated at the time of the engagement toCecilia:her mother had wanted to give Cecilia a family diamond on the occasion of her wed-ding, but Leon insisted on giving her his own jewelry.This incident may reflect Leon’s concern over the possible influence of Cecilia’smother on her. Ottilie described Willy’s grandmother as a very intelligent, snobbish, dramat-ic, and meddlesome woman. She seems regularly to have been at odds with Leon, and hervisits to the Reich home were a constant source of tension and trouble, since she appears tohave been quite capable of standing up to Leon and frequently did so, particularly whenLeon and Cecilia quarreled. In one of his few reported criticisms of his mother, Willy waslater to describe her as a “silly goose” because she allowed her mother to influence her somuch; he, too, disliked his meddling grandmother.However much the grandmother may have contributed to the family tension, thereappears to have been a good deal without her. In a telling anecdote, Robert mentioned to"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-191745éditionsles atomes de l’âmeOttilie at the time of the birth of their own daughter that he wanted her to feel free as achild to speak up, indicating he had never had such freedom. And whatever Leon’s oppres-siveness toward Robert, it was worse toward Willy, since Robert believed he as the secondson was spared some of his father’s strictures.Another story of Ottilie’s is revealing. Both brothers were prone to temper out-bursts and when one of them became very furious, the other would shake a finger at himand say: “Just like Father.”Relations between the brothers themselves seem also to have been complex. Reichrarely spoke of his brother. Indeed, some of his old friends did not even know that he hada brother. On the other hand, Ottilie feels that in the period she knew them both there wasa good deal of affection between them, even if it was mingled with competitive elements.She describes Robert as a gentler, more reasonable person than Willy. In another story thatsays something about their relationship as well as their feelings toward Leon, Ottilie recallsWilly bitterly criticizing their father: “Father always had to have his own way on the farm.”Robert corrected the “always,” recalling a time when a foreman had sharply disagreed withLeon. Robert had expected his father to punish the man severely for such independence but,to his surprise, Leon replied quietly: “He has a point.” In later years, Reich was to value cer-tain co-workers who possessed this capacity to see “both sides,” though he could tease thesame people as mercilessly as he must have teased Robert. Once, when a valued associatebristled under such teasing, Reich caught himself up short and said: “I am always the olderbrother,” implying he was aware of his bullying tendencies7.In the family legends, Willy was the more reckless and mischievous son whose mis-deeds got him into trouble with his father. Once, Reich either rode a horse before it was bro-ken in or prematurely put his younger brother on a horse. In any case, his father was furi-ous and Robert tried to protect Willy from the paternal spanking.So far, most of these anecdotes have painted the father in a negative, oppressivelight. However, judging from the extent that Reich identified with his father, he must haveloved as well as feared and hated him.I have already mentioned Reich’s pride in his father’sprogressive thinking on cultural and business matters. Reich also seems to have very muchtaken after his father in his excellence at “running things.” Indeed, at Orgonon he tookpleasure in managing all kinds ofpractical matters from construction to the selling of tim-ber.IfLeon was oppressive, he was also busy, and Reich appears to have had manyopportunities for unsupervised play. He enjoyed farm life the animals, nature, and his peas-ant nursemaids. In his later, somewhat idealized memories of his childhood, he referred witha good deal ofpositive feeling to the Austrian country life hunting, fishing, riding, and allkinds of interesting visitors to the family estate.Socially, the long arm of their father was often felt. Reich was not allowed to playwith peasant children nor with Yiddish-speaking Jewish children. The father appears to havebeen socially very ambitious,consorting with government officials and other high-level per-sons, but Willy’s opportunities for playing with peers were scarce. The feudal quality of the"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth46éditionsles atomes de l’âmelife is further revealed by a story Reich told his second wife, Elsa Lindenberg. As a child hewas not permitted to take part in village dances. But one night, while he was watching thedance, a peasant boy threw a stone at him. Willy told his father and Leon hit the boy’s father.So, quite early, Reich was exposed to the brute power not only of the father in the home butof the property owner in the community, and he experienced both in ways that would markhim8.Given Reich’s later interests, it is not surprising that he paid a good deal of atten-tion to his own sexual history. In this area he seems to have had a good deal of freedom,something not uncommon for children who were much in the care of peasant help. Heremembered as a boy of four sleeping in the servants’ room when his parents were away.On several occasions, he overheard or witnessed intercourse between a maid and herboyfriend. In the course of these experiences, he asked the maid if he could “play” the lover.He stressed to one informant that she permitted him to do so in a very helpful way. Withoutstimulating him actively, she allowed him to move on top of her.9Whether this happenedonce or often is uncertain. But Reich clearly attributed great importance to his relationshipwith this peasant girl. He once said that by the time he was four there were no secrets forhim about sex, and he related this clarity in part to his sexual play with his nursemaid.He also related it to his general interest in farm life and to particular experiences hehad with a tutor. Thus, Reich wrote sometime around 1948:WR’s interest in biology and natural science was created early by his life on thefarm, close to agriculture, cattle-breeding, etc., in which he took part every summerand during the harvest. Between his eighth and twelfth years, he had his own col-lection and breeding laboratory of butterflies, insects, plants, etc. under the guid-ance of a private teacher. The natural life functions, including the sexual function,were familiar to him as far back as he can remember. That may very well have deter-mined his later strong inclination,as a biopsychiatrist, toward the biological foun-dation ofthe emotional life ofman, and also his biophysical discoveries in thefields ofmedicine and biology,as well as education10.The social status of Reich’s family combined with the isolation of farm life mayhave helped Reich educationally, since it permitted him private tutors during his elementaryschool years rather than having to attend a more rigid school. Judging from Reich’s recollec-tion of his “breeding laboratory,” at least one of his tutors was an imaginative teacher. (Justhow many tutors there were is unclear.) Robert remembered particularly a Dr. Sachter as aremarkable, creative teacher. Ottilie quotes Robert as saying that Dr. Sachter stimulated a“ferocious hunger for knowledge” in the two brothers.How long Reich was taught at home is not clear. He has written that he was pri-vately educated between the ages of six and ten, and that he attended a gymnasium inCzernowitz between the ages of ten and eighteen. However, since the gymnasium was locat-ed several hundred miles from Reich’s home, it is possible that he continued to be tutored"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-191747éditionsles atomes de l’âmefor several years past the age of ten, going to the gymnasium once a year to take exams. Atleast Ottilie recalled hearing that something like this may have happened.The Tragedy, the Curse, and the Origin of the MissionIt is hard to say how unusual Reich’s childhood was until the age of about twelve.An authoritarian father and a younger doting mother would not have been so remarkable forthat era. However, there seems to have been a degree of family tension beyond the “nor-mal” range, stemming from the father’s jealous rages and his high expectations for his chil-dren.The combination of a creative tutor, the young Reich’s own zest for learning, andthe opportunities afforded by farm life may well have stimulated Reich’s intellectual curios-ity to an unusual degree. In any case, it is worth noting that his interests as a child seem tohave been more scientific than literary. He was not especially shy and bookish, as one mightexpect from a “mama’s boy.” Indeed, his extroverted interests appear to have had a gooddeal in common with those of his father.At about the age of twelve an event or a series of events happened that would rad-ically influence Reich’s future. Before describing the crisis, something should be said abouthow Reich disclosed it. First, he told several people. The ones I talked with were all women;but there were many others, men as well as women, who knew Reich very well, to whom henever mentioned these events. Those he did tell, he pledged to secrecy.Secondly, the dramatic means of disclosure was also shrouded in secrecy. In late1919 or early 1920, when he was about twenty-two or twenty-three and already a practicinganalyst, Reich wrote his first published article, “Ueber einen Fall von Durchbruch derInzestschranke Pubertat” (“The Breakthrough of the Incest Taboo in Puberty”).In this article, Reich wrote as though he were treating a patient who illustrated cer-tain psychological mechanisms. However, there can be little doubt that the “patient” is Reichhimself, especially since many years later Reich told his elder daughter that the article was aself-analysis11. The crucial details coincide so exactly with what Reich told others that onecannot doubt its essential autobiographical authenticity.Reich’s disguise worked. With the exception of his daughter, no one I have talkedwith knew this article to be autobiographical. Indeed, most people did not know of its exis-tence, since it was published in a rather obscure sexological journal whereas Reich’s otherearly articles appeared in psychoanalytic periodicals. Finally, while Reich faithfully listed thearticle in his bibliography, he never referred to it in his later writings, nor did he mention itorally to my knowledge. His attitude toward this publication was clearly different from hisattitude toward other early writings that he would frequently cite or mention.To turn to the article itself, Reich declares he is presenting the case because it illus-trates in an unusually clear way the breakthrough of incestuous wishes into consciousnessin puberty. He describes the patient as a twentyyear-old man, a student at a technical school.This is one oftwo disguises, aside from the format used in the article, for he himself was a"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth48éditionsles atomes de l’âmemedical student at the time. The other is that he describes the patient as having “four sis-ters,” whereas Reich had only one brother. Interestingly enough, at one point in the narra-tive he slips in a reference to the patient’s “younger brother.”The patient had sought analysis because he suffered from states of depression anda tendency to ruminate, in which he would make a “huge case” out of “little insignificantthings.” In the report, Reich as analyst writes that the patient broke off treatment after exact-ly four weeks at the point where it was necessary for him to verbalize certain painful eventsthat had occurred in puberty.Reich then has the patient send the analyst a lengthy letter describing on paper whathe could not say in person. Because of the importance of the incidents, I shall quote fromthis “letter” in some detail. The analyst opens with an introductory paragraph:“The point” at which the analysis broke off after so short a time because of thepatient’s conscious inhibitions, concerns a relationship which developed betweenthe patient’s tutor and his mother, and which the son observed from its beginnings.Following a lengthy description [in the letter] of the mother’s beauty, he [thepatient] writes about this relationship.He then goes on to describe the entire incident in letter form:N (name of tutor) began to court her, stimulated by walks they took together. Heapparently became ever bolder as he recognized how things were going the jealousscenes, etc. between my parents, and the fact that mother liked him. At the begin-ning I was not completely clear about the developing relationship. But I began tofollow them when I noticed mother going into his room when father napped afterlunch. In part I was erotically curious, in part I was filled with fearful thoughts thatfather would wake up. And from then on I played spy and pursuer, but at the sametime also defender (italicized by me the analyst) against any surprises from father. Icannot clarify further the reasons for my behavior. Either it was unconscious hatredagainst my father or sexual titillation to be aware of such stunning secrets aboutwhich my father remained ignorant. I believe that both factors were equally respon-sible for my behavior.The relationship between my mother and tutor grew ever deeper; not a daypassed in which they did not seek and find the opportunity to be alone.This state of affairs lasted about three months. Their meeting always tookplace after lunch and was limited to a few minutes. I did not think of the possibil-ity ofa sexual relationship. But one day I also became certain about that. Fatherhad gone away at about six o’clock. Mother had again gone to N and remainedthere a very long time. I waited the whole time outside the room, struggling withthe decision whether to intrude or to tell father.A vague something held me back.When mother emerged from the room, with flushed cheeks and an erratic,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-191749éditionsles atomes de l’âmeunsteady look, then I knew that it had happened, whether for the first time I natu-rally could not decide. Crying to myself as I stood in the corner, shielded by ascreen, I waited to surprise my mother, but that did not happen, to the unhappinessof all of us. For I am convinced that my surprising her right after the deed wouldhave brought my mother to her senses and even at that late date, would have savedthe marriage of mother and father. That was the only possible hope.What held me back at the time, I am not able to say, but at the samemoment there arose in me both sympathy with my father and the desire to leavewith my lips sealed. (I was about twelve years of age.) Shortly after Christmas father went away for three weeks and I experi-enced the most horrible, the most upsetting events, which burned themselvesdeeply into my feelings and thoughts.Mother slept, as always during father’s absence, in the last bedroom on thecorridor. After that came our room, then the dining room, and then his [ISPs]room. Right on the first night (I was so tense I had not closed my eyes) I heard mymother get up and the horror grabs me by the throat! heard her slippered walk andsaw her, clad only in a nightgown, pass through our room. Soon I heard the doorofhis room open and not completely shut.And then quiet.I sprang up from my bed and followed, shivering, my teeth chattering fromanxiety, horror and cold; I moved right up to the door, which was only partlyclosed, and listened. Oh horrible memory, which tears my remembrance of mymother to dust, her memory always besmirched anew with dirt and muck! Must Ithen say everything? The pen bristles, no, my ego, my whole being is against it, andyet I will and must write on.I heard kisses, whispers, the frightening noise of the bed, and on it lay mymother. And a few yards away stood your son and heard your shame. Suddenlyquiet.I had evidently made a noise in my excitement, for I heard calming wordsfrom him and then, then again, oh! (The last sentence, especially the last words,written apparently in the highest excitement,with heavy strokes of the pen.) Only quiet,quiet toward this nerve-shattering tragedy, in order to accom-plish the superhuman! To judge objectively! What a mockery! What a resolution! From that catastrophic night I remember only that my wish at first was toplunge into the room but I was held back by the thought: they will kill you! I had read somewhere that lovers get rid of any intruder, so with wild fan-tasies in my brain I slipped back to my bed, my joy of life shattered, torn apart inmy inmost being for my whole life! So it went, night after night; always I slipped back and waited till morning.Gradually I became used to it! The horror disappeared and erotic feelings won theupper hand.And then the thought came to me to plunge into the room, and to have intercoursewith my mother with the threat that ifshe didn’t I would tell my father.For my part, I went regularly to the chambermaid12."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth50éditionsles atomes de l’âmeIn giving the patient’s sexual history, Reich had earlier commented that the patienthad had sexual intercourse for the first time with a household maid at the age of eleven anda half, shortly before he began observing his mother’s affair.Reich next summarizes the “patient’s” report of the aftermath of the affair:“Thefather apparently discovered it, and the mother committed suicide by taking poison. “Reich does not gointo the immediate effect on the patient of the mother’s suicide, save to say that “after thedeath of the mother his relationship with his father improved.” The analyst quotes thepatient as writing that he became his “father’s best friend and adviser.”Reich told other people some crucial details that were left out of the published casehistory. The most significant concerns how the father found out about his wife’s adultery.Reich explained to several persons close to him that he himself had told his father.The version that seems most authentic is that Reich first hinted of the affair to hisfather13. Sternly interrogating his twelve-year-old son, the father was able to force the fullstory out of him. Leon then took the boy to confront the mother.How long elapsed between Leon’s discovery of the affair and Cecilia’s suicide isunclear14. Leon appears to have treated Reich’s mother very badly after he had found proofof what for years had been his accusation. At one point afterward, Cecilia’s mother urgedher daughter to take the two grandsons, leave Leon, now even more brutal, and live with her.But this Cecilia could not or would not do. Divorce was not common in her social circle,although it did occur;indeed,the wife ofCecilia’s uncle, the wealthy Josef Blum, haddivorced him in order to marry another. Later, Robert was struck by the fact that his moth-er drank a cheap household cleanser, something like Lysol, when there were more efficientagents available. He wondered whether the attempt had not been motivated by the desire tofrighten Leon and induce him to stop tormenting her15.Ifthe choice ofmethod was not meant to frighten, it may have been intended tohorrify. Cecilia lingered on in great pain for several days. Her mother once again visited thehome.16What Willy was experiencing we do not know, though we can guess. In the casehistory, he described how “the patient” had struggled with two impulses: the desire to tellhis father, thereby striking back at the mother and the tutor, on the one hand; and, on theother, the desire to protect his mother from his father’s revenge. In the kind of compromiseReich was later to study so carefully, he chose to “hint” about what had happened. Theresults were devastating, and the guilt and remorse he must have felt as a child and a youngman can only be imagined. Even into his thirties, Reich would sometimes wake in the nightoverwhelmed by the thought that he had “killed”his mother17.Following the father’s discovery of the affair, the tutor was banished from thehome. (What else Leon did we do not know.) Reich tells us little about who the tutor was.From the narrative it appears that he had been in the household only a short time prior tothe affair. However, this could be a disguise or a literary condensation. One wonders: Wasthis the tutor whom the boys found to be such a creative teacher? The same tutor who guid-ed Reich’s education in the breeding laboratory between his eighth and twelfth years? (Reich"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-191751éditionsles atomes de l’âmementioned a private tutor directing his studies in the laboratory, but does not say whetherthere was one or several tutors.) If so, it was an extraordinary concatenation of intellectualand emotional events: the young Reich is studying the sexual function with a man who hasan affair with his mother. In reporting the affair, the child plays a crucial role in the loss oftwo extremely important people in his life his mother through suicide, his tutor through ban-ishment. The scientific study of sexuality with the tutor ceases, to be resumed by Reich someyears later and never abandoned thereafter.It is clear that Reich himself felt that the events surrounding his mother’s deathinfluenced his later life crucially18. The starkly tragic episode could well comprise the stim-ulus for the development of what Erikson termed “an account to be settled” one thatremains an “existential debt all the rest of a lifetime.”19Also Reich, like Erikson, was awarethat one event or even a cluster of events did not in itself cause the “curse” but rather con-densed and intensified pervasive childhood conflicts. Thus, in his self-analysis, Reich care-fully noted earlier childhood themes and their relationship to the event. As a child, he hadwitnessed intercourse between his nursemaid and her lover. He recalled noting that hismother would follow his father when he retired for his afternoon nap, and thinking: “Nowthey must have intercourse.”Moreover, the parental relationship took place in an atmosphere of great conflictand paradox even before the affair with the tutor. The mother slept with the father, but thefather accused her of sleeping with others and called her a whore. The mother had intercourse with the father and yet in many ways musthave communicated to Willy that he, not the outrageous father, was truly her beloved.All these themes reappear in a new and shattering form when the affair occurs.Now the mother prefers another over both the son and the father. And however hard it isfor a son to accept the sexual claims of his father upon his mother, it is much harder forhim to accept her taking a lover, especially a young lover who is close to the boy. The affairnot only stimulated into consciousness Reich’s incestuous wishes;it must also have provokedin him a deep sense ofsexual rejection. At some level the boy Willy must have asked him-self: Why did she prefer N. over me? And the answer at some level must have been: BecauseI am small and inadequate.Understandably, Reich was to show throughout his life anextraordinary competitiveness and a deep sensitivity to put-downs and being made to look“small.”Since the entire incident as well as the family constellation that preceded it help toilluminate so many of Reich’s later interests, I shall reserve the main discussion of their sig-nificance until they can be more directly connected with his work.But a few preliminary points should be noted here. First, recalling his memorieseven from the vantage point of a twenty-two-year-old, Reich tends to blame his mother evenmore strongly than himself. She should not have had an affair; she “besmirched” herself.True, Reich should have “saved the marriage” by surprising her, but his mother should nothave entered the adulterous relationship in the first place. Such emphasis is quite differentfrom the subsequent analysis Reich made of this kind of social tragedy. The role of the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth52éditionsles atomes de l’âmeauthoritarian father, the irrational condemnation of extramarital sexuality, the victimizationand persecution of those who break society’s sexual laws all these themes would come later.Second, Reich follows traditional analytic theory in discussing his own childhoodand adolescent sexuality. He focuses on the disruptive aspects of his early sexual experi-ences, his heightened Oedipal complex, his witnessing the primal scene, his seeing the fatherpushed aside by the tutor, which impelled into consciousness his own incestuous fantasies—all factors seen as contributing to Reich’s conflicts at the time he started his analysis. Indeed,Reich ends the case history by supporting the necessity of the latency period, which presup-poses the child’s repressing his incestuous wishes through identification with the father. Itwould take time before Reich became fully aware of the positive aspects of his sexual devel-opment and was able to integrate them within his theoretical formulations.Indeed—and this is my third point—Reich sees, among other sequels of the moth-er’s affair, a profound weakening of the father’s authority. Again in the context of the casereport, the consequences for the son were negative, awakening his own incestuous hopes.But, for the course of Reich’s later development, his not being unduly awed by seeminglystrong authority figures was to have its advantages.Fourth, whatever interpretations one gives, the crisis must have heightened thesense ofdiscrepancy between what Freud called the manifest and the latent and what Reichwas later to distinguish as “surface” and “depth.” On the surface, the mother was marriedand belonged to Leon. At another level, in many ways she may well have indicated to herson Willy that she preferred him to his often brutal father. At still another level, she went toLeon, not Willy, for the intimate, exciting, and frightening act of sexual intercourse. Andthen, as the greatest discrepancy of all, she had an affair with the tutor, pushing aside boththe powerful father and the adoring son. These were heavy emotional and cognitive puzzlesfor a young boy to ponder.Finally, I would suggest that the crisis and its tragic aftermath markedly increasedReich’s sense of guilt and his tendency to look inward, to ponder the deeper meaning ofthings, particularly emotional relationships. This introspective tendency was combined witha very extroverted, vigorous, practical orientation. The combination was to play its part insome ofReich’s remarkable intellectual achievements.Reich talked relatively little about his early years. But there are a few childhoodanecdotes he shared with others, and there is the highly illuminating self-analysis. He wroteor told friends almost nothing about the years between starting at the Czernowitz gymnasi-um (or secondary school) shortly after Cecilia’s death and his entrance into the Army in1915.Perhaps he was especially depressed during those years and hence did not like to recallthem.We cannot say for certain.We do know that he attended the all-male gymnasium in Czernowitz, which had aLatin and Greek curriculum. He reports that his best subjects were German, Latin, andNatural Science,and that he graduated in 1915 mit Stimmeneinhelligkeit(with unanimousapproval) on his exams. Later, he spoke with some pride of having had eight years of Latin"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-191753éditionsles atomes de l’âmeand Greek, and at times he would show some disdain for those less rigorously educated20.Reich had a real affection for certain “old-fashioned” ways, including his traditional school-ing. We shall meet this kind of complexity again and again, to the chagrin of those whowould prefer a one- or at most two-dimensional hero or villain.The gymnasium years must have exposed Reich to a wide range of new stimuli.Czernowitz, where he now boarded, was an active, thriving city, the provincial capital ofBukovina, with a population of 100,000. There were four gymnasiums in the city and anexcellent university. About one third of the population was Jewish, with many Jewish doc-tors and lawyers, but few Jewish professors. Anti-Semitism still ran strong in academic cir-cles.An anecdote Reich told his daughter Eva and which she related to me is telling. InCzernowitz he occasionally frequented brothels and on at least one instance he saw severalof his gymnasium professors also at the establishment. Once again apparently stern anddemanding male authorities were not so perfect after all.A student in Czernowitz had the opportunity to see excellent theater. There wereSaturday performances that young people could go to at a reduced rate. Ottilie, who alsoattended gymnasium in Czernowitz a few years after Reich, recalls particularly the happyvacations when she returned to the family’s country home, with holiday parties, and sleigh-ing in the winter. Robert commented that such gaiety was not to be found in his home.During vacations and summers, Reich returned to Jujinetz and helped his father runthe farm. Reich mentions his improved relationship with his father in the case history, butwe know little of what it was like for him to work with Leon, who was now “completely bro-ken” after the mother’s suicide21. We do know that Leon placed high expectations on hiselder son, but with these expectations went a sense of great privilege. If Leon was the kingof the estate, Willy was the “crown prince.” Perhaps in Leon’s last years he was also prepar-ing Willy to become the real leader. Yet we should remember Willy’s recollection of hisfather as “always having to make the decisions.”One incident that reflects the father’s concern for his son, but which had unhappyconsequences, has to do with Willy’s bad skin condition. Exactly when this developed orwhen it was treated is unclear. When Willy was either a child or an adolescent, his father tookhim to Vienna for consultation and therapy22. Willy stayed at a hospital there for six weeks,but the treatment was oflittle avail, for he suffered from a skin condition all his life. At somepoint, perhaps on the Vienna visit, Reich’s skin condition was diagnosed as psoriasis.Sometime during his adolescence Willy received medication that contained arsenicfor his skin disease. This kind of treatment is of dubious value, for there are generally sideeffects such as nausea, bloating, and vertigo; a further side effect is an intensification of thepsoriasis. It is possible that this happened to Willy, for in later years he spoke with deepresentment ofthe treatments, feeling that the medicine had aggravated rather than relievedthe illness. Probably his lifelong suspicion of most medications stemmed in part from hisexperiences with psoriasis. By the time he was twenty-one, those who knew him in Viennacommented on his “acne.”"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth54éditionsles atomes de l’âmeReich’s skin condition may have developed around the time of his mother’s death.If so, it would certainly fit psychoanalytic theories of the origin of the illness. These theo-ries posit that psoriasis is psychosomatic in origin a partial and punitive self-mutilation forsome guilt over a real or imagined crime, and also an expression of anger.Reich’s next known trip with his father was under still more unhappy conditions.Sometime during or before Reich’s seventeenth year, his father contracted pneumonia.According to both Robert and Willy, he did this deliberately. He took out a large insurancepolicy, then stood for hours in cold weather in a pond, ostensibly fishing. To die from con-tracting an illness in this fashion would protect the sons’ insurance claim, whereas direct sui-cide would not.Leon’s illness worsened, developing into TB. Apparently Willy took him either toan Austrian mountain resort several hours from Vienna or to the Swiss Alps for treatment.The father died in 1914 as a result of his illness. (For some reason the boys did not receiveany insurance money, and for the rest of his life Reich had a profound distrust of insurancepolicies, refusing to take out any. He used to say that something in the fine print wouldalways rule out the company’s responsibility in an actual claim.) In the second decade of this century, it was not unusual for a person of seventeento have lost both parents.However, to have lost both parents in the way Reich did was mostunusual. A tragic sequence of events, in which the young man plays an active role, heats toflashpoint the tensions already existent between the parents and their older son. Both par-ents die by suicide in the aftermath, the mother directly and apparently quite soon, the fatherindirectly and some years later.Out of this background, with its parallels to the experience of Dostoevski andEugene O’Neill, Reich came into young manhood. According to his own account, after hisfather’s death in 1914 he directed the farm himself, without interrupting his studies, until hisentrance into the Army in 191523.It tells us something about Reich’s inner resources that he was able t keep function-ing effectively,whatever his depression and guilt, after the death of both his mother and hisfather. Indeed, we can hypothesize that one dominant mode of handling loss for Reich wasto throw himself into work, to “keep moving,” in a favorite phrase of his. One may alsohypothesize that his own guilt and rage connected with the dark tragedies that ended hisrelationship with his mother, father, and tutor made later enduring relationships, as well astheir loss,hard for Reich. A host of other factors connected with Reich’s work and the per-sonalities of those he was close to played their part in the painfully disrupted human rela-tionships he was to experience again and again. But from his early traumas he brought a vul-nerability a tendency to repeat his childhood crises in one or another form. In his own mindthere was always a question of whom to blame when he and another person or he and anorganization quarreled and parted ways. We know that Reich blamed himself heavily, tooheavily, for the death of his mother. Afterward, at least in his publications, he was to assignmost ofthe blame to others when things soured, although he would occasionally giveglimpses of a dark awareness of his own contribution."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-191755éditionsles atomes de l’âmeMy emphasis at this point, however, is on Reich’s capacity to stand on his own afterhis father’s death. From the age of seventeen, he essentially had to manage for himself. Thecapacity to be independent an ability Reich was to see as an important attribute of psycho-logical health was something that he himself gained at a relatively early age. Later in his life,he had the marked characteristic of having to do things himself, of not wanting to bedependent on others. How much this had to do with his identification with his father’s modeof functioning, how much with his fear of being dependent after the losses in his life, is anopen question.Even with scant knowledge of the school years, we do know that Reich did otherthings besides work. In the part of the self-analytic article that deals with his sexual history,Reich mentions that “between fourteen and eighteen, masturbation alternated with sexualintercourse.” Incidentally, this sentence immediately follows his description of his first sex-ual intercourse, supposedly at eleven and a half. The gap in the sexual history between theages of eleven and a half and fourteen suggests that Reich used the semi-literary form ofthe article to lower the age for the start of his sexual life. Indeed, he told others that his firstintercourse occurred at thirteen. That he should have made this eleven and a half in the self-analysis may be due to several factors. It makes a more dramatic story that he should havehad his first sexual relationship at the same time his mother had an affair with his tutor.Then, too, Reich took some pride in the fact that his sex life started early, and the tempta-tion to make it even earlier may have been irresistible. According to Ottilie, Willy in his twen-ties used to tease Robert for his late start sexually at fourteen.Aside from the brothel visits, we know next to nothing of Reich’s adolescent het-erosexual relationships. One girl almost makes it into reality, but we cannot be sure. Ottiliehas a somewhat hazy recollection that when Reich took his sick father away for treatment,he became involved with a cousin, the daughter of Leon’s brother, who lived in Vienna.Apparently, the father took with him some jewelry that had belonged to Cecilia. After Leon’sdeath Reich inherited the jewelry and, again according to Ottilie, he disbursed these posses-sions in a capricious way, giving some of them to his cousin in a vain attempt to win her.True or not,the story is consistent with the impulsive way Reich in later years couldgive gifts. There is also a kind of justice that there should have been no lasting material lega-cy from the tragedy-haunted home. First no insurance, then no jewelry. And, in 1915, theRussian invasion of Bukovina devastated the family estate. If after the mother’s affair withthe tutor circa 1909 Reich was caught up in one personal tragedy after another, from 1915on he was caught up in social ones.He had lost his parents; now he lost the estate of which,briefly, he had been the ruler. From being a rich young man, he had become poor. Moreover,before the war’s end the whole Austro-Hungarian Empire was to collapse, and the entire wayoflife that he had known in his formative years—the large farm, the many servants—became a thing of the past.Reich once told his daughter Eva how war enveloped the family farm24. Suddenlyin the summer of1915 the Russians were all around them and the fields were aflame. Reichdashed into the house and saw one of the servants calmly combing her hair. “The Russians"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth56éditionsles atomes de l’âmeare here,” he shouted, and they fled. In later years Reich was to keep in mind this image ofhimself notifying others of dangers they did not know about.What happened next is obscure. Ottilie believes that both brothers went to Viennaand stayed with Grandmother Roniger. At least she is sure that Robert, only fifteen at thetime, was cared for by his grandmother during this period. Perhaps she also helped Willy fora brief time in Vienna before he was mobilized into the Army.Reich’s military years are not well documented. There is no evidence that he expe-rienced them with any particular distaste, at least not until close to the end.Use Ollendorff has gathered together most of the known facts about Reich’s Armyyears:There are a few photographs in the archives which Reich sometimes would lookthrough with us, showing him as a dashing young officer in the Austrian Army. Hewore a small mustache, and was a very handsome young man, indeed. I think onthe whole he enjoyed his military life. He was not a pacifist by nature, and theresponsibility for a group of people was very much to his liking. He saw active dutyon the Italian front, and sometimes told how they were shelled for days at a time,dashing out ofa shelter one by one at certain counts to get food and supplies. Heremembered the very cooperative Italian girls who taught him a smattering ofItalian, and he blamed one unhappy episode, when he was stuck for three days in aswampy ditch, for a renewed outbreak of his skin condition that was never to becompletely cured.He must have liked wearing an officer’s uniform. He told us that eventhough he was in the infantry, he always wore spurs, and that on his rare furloughshe loved to go riding at the Vienna Reitschule.I have a feeling that at that time his social conscience was not very devel-oped,and that he took the war in stride without bothering much about the rightsand wrongs.He was,up to that time, certainly no rebel25.There are a few important additions that can be made to Ollendorff’s account.Reich was more affected by the suffering than her summary conveys. He recalled being hor-rified at seeing a fellow soldier shot before his eyes on the way to get food.The Reich ofthis period is most clearly described by Ottilie, who saw him when hevisited Vienna on a furlough. She found him “open, lost, hungry for affection as well asfood,” and very responsive to the warmth of Ottilie’s family. By then, Reich was thorough-ly disillusioned with the war; he found it senseless and wondered what the fighting was allabout.Reich had a strong sense of World War I as the watershed between an old worldand a new one struggling to be born. Politically, although he could not articulate the posi-tion,he was ready to leap into the Socialist youth movement of postwar Vienna.There is a certain similarity in the way Reich experienced his childhood and the way"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"3 : Reich’s Childhood and Youth: 1897-191757éditionsles atomes de l’âmehe experienced the Army. At first, in each case, we seem to be watching a vigorous, extro-verted person. Then tragedy hits or rather, the tragic aspects intensify and bear in upon him.In the first instance, he felt partly responsible. The second was so vast he could feel himselfonly as victim rather than executioner. Indeed, one can hypothesize that the outer drama andconflict of the war provided some relief from his own inner turmoil. His answers to bothwere to change over the years. What was the cause of that family tragedy? What was thecause of that devastation, which swept Europe and in which he participated for so long soblindly? I have assumed a need on Reich’s part to work off inner tension through anextremely vigorous, committed life—through the sense of a mission. He made somethinglike this idea explicit when in the mid-1930s he discussed his reaction to the end of WorldWar I. He was relieved, he said, that now he could lift his head above the trench withoutworrying. He looked forward to resuming his studies. But he also felt sad, and it was sometime before he understood why. It was because during the war—for all its misery—he atleast had the feeling that he was living under a heroic destiny. He was afraid that with the warended, he would be caught up in the usual trivialities of existence26.This story is important because it points to Reich’s strong need to live a heroic lifebefore he had anything specific to be heroic about. In a life of danger, he could feel somerelief from the inner pressure, some surcease from the guilt of the past. In time, he wouldchannel this “heroic” effort into a task that made sense, into a mission not of simply stay-ing alive but repairing the conditions that had produced the early tragedies.One other wartime story rounds out the recapitulation of past themes and at thesame time points to the future. Reich recalled to Ottilie the experience of a sexual embracewith a young woman in the Italian village where he was stationed in 1916. Reich went on tocomment that he had been having sexual intercourse for some years before this relationshipand that he had enjoyed it, but that this woman was different from any he had known before.For the first time he experienced the full meaning of love. Also for the first time he was toexperience what he would later name and describe in detail—and for which he was to fightso hard—“orgastic potency.” But in 1916 he found the experience very hard to put intowords.To explain Reich’s meaning of the term is to anticipate the story. Yet this Armymemory serves to underscore one point:As a nineteen-year-old,Reich noted a kind of sexual embrace that was new and dif-ferent for him, an event that was to play its part in shaping his future work. He first encoun-tered it experientially, without any clear cognitive understanding. Thus, to the family tragedysurrounding his mother’s death and to the social upheaval of the war was added the issue ofhis own heterosexual life as a momentous question that Reich was dimly struggling to under-stand."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth58éditionsles atomes de l’âme4 : Becoming a Psychoanalyst: 1918-1920Soon after his discharge from the Army in the fall of 1918, Reich went to Viennato begin his professional education. Here he entered a milieu of new, provocative ideas andsocial movements. Vienna was home to Freud and most of his early disciples. Although stillisolated from and pilloried by the medical establishment, psychoanalysis was beginning togain some influence on the larger social scene. Vienna was also home to the composerArnold Schonberg, the painter Oskar Kokoschka, and the satirist Karl Kraus. These andother artists fought hard against the cultural sentimentality and artificiality of prewarAustria. The new, more trenchant and psychologically profound literature of James Joyce,Marcel Proust, D. H. Lawrence, and Thomas Mann; the candid social criticism of G, B.Shaw,Bertrand Russell, and Havelock Ellis; the cubist vision of Picasso and Braque; thephysics of Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Niels Bohr these were but a few of the revo-lutionary trends sweeping intellectual circles throughout Europe. It was a time of break-throughs. One of the leitmotifs of the period was the urge to look beneath the surface andto see hitherto concealed or unknown forces in man’s psyche and social relationships as wellas in nature.In Austria, the Social Democratic Party had recently come to power, eager to initi-ate a vast program of economic, social, and educational reforms in an impoverished, war-torn country, its people cold, hungry, and embittered in the wake of a disastrous war. ManyAustrians gravitated toward the urban-, socialist-, and secular-minded Social Democrats. Analmost equal number harked back to the dynastic days of Franz Josef and supported theChristian Socialist Party,which was heavily Catholic in religion, conservative in economics,and rural in constituency. But whether one was on the political left or right, one was likelyto be deeply engaged.Before Reich could fully enter this scientific, artistic and political ferment, he firsthad to establish himself economically, for he was penniless. His first benefactor was hisyounger brother, Robert. Although eighteen to Willy’s twenty-one in 1918, Robert felt aresponsibility to help him continue his education. There seems to have been an understand-ing between the two that Willy was the especially gifted one and that his education camefirst. The idea was that Robert would help Willy get his education, and then Willy would helpRobert. The second half of this plan never materialized; Robert joined a business enterprise,an international transportation firm in which he rapidly gained an executive position1.Reich’s initial plans were uncertain. In the fall of 1918, he enrolled in the Faculty ofLaw at the University of Vienna. It is not clear why he was attracted to the law. Perhaps the"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"4 : Becoming a Psychoanalyst: 1918-192059éditionsles atomes de l’âmeissue of responsibility connected with his family tragedy motivated him; the close connec-tion of the law with politics also may have appealed to him. For if Reich had been apoliti-cal at the start of World War I, he was radicalized by its end. Once a student in Vienna, hebecame deeply immersed in the Social Democratic “youth movement.” Even within the gen-erally socialist ideology of these young people, Reich became known as one who took a quiteradical position and argued vociferously against his more moderate friends2.Reich’s reasons for leaving the law are clearer than his attraction to it: he found legalstudies dull and remote. Before the end of the fall semester, he had switched to the Facultyof Medicine. But on a deeper level, legal versus medical or scientific orientations were toplay a part in his thinking throughout his life. Later he was to search for the “exploiters”who caused and benefited from sexual suppression among the masses; and still later, for“conspirators” who “masterminded” the attacks against his work. The quest for underlyingemotional-social forces that transcended issues of blame or legal judgment meant that deep-er moral issues would often be simultaneously involved.At medical school Reich was off and running intellectually, never to stop again untilhis death. Unlike many students who later became psychoanalysts and who found the physi-cian’s training a largely tedious route to their desired goal, Reich began medical school withno specific specialty in mind.He was deeply immersed in almost all his courses, particular-ly anatomy and the clinical rotations. Only pharmacology and forensic medicine left himcold3. I have noted his distrust of medication as a result of his treatment for psoriasis.Reich’s dislike of forensic medicine may have reflected a continuing recoil from the study oflaw.In medical school, Reich encountered a dichotomy in science and philosophy thatwas relevant to his ultimate choice of psychoanalysis. On the one hand, there was the exper-imental, mechanistic tradition stemming from Hermann Helmholtz, the German physicistand physician. In this tradition, the laws of physics and chemistry were applied to the studyofthe human organism.It strongly opposed the assumption ofany special forces govern-ing living substances that were not susceptible to laboratory study. Such concepts smackedof the mysticism that thoroughgoing empiricism must always oppose.An earlier tradition,termed Naturphilosophie,included Goethe among its supportersand represented a form of pantheistic monism. If Helmholtz’s school saw man as only anespecially complicated kind of chemical machine, one capable of preserving and reproduc-ing itself,Naturphilosophiesaw both man and the universe as organisms, “ultimately consist-ing of forces, of activities, of creations, of emergings—organized in eternal basic conflicts,in polarity”.4Reich first experienced the conflict between the two traditions in terms of the cur-rent debate between a “mechanistic” and a “vitalistic” explanation of life. Years later, look-ing back on this period,he posed the problem in the following way:The question,“What is Life?” lay behind everything I learned. ... It became clearthat the mechanistic concept oflife, which dominated our study of medicine at that"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth60éditionsles atomes de l’âmetime, was unsatisfactory There was no denying the principle of a creative powergoverning life; only it was not satisfactory as long as it was not tangible, as long asit could not be described or practically handled. For, rightly, this was considered thesupreme goal of natural science5.The vitalists, men like Henri Bergson, who postulated a special force, an élan vitalgoverning living things, greatly appealed to Reich, for “they seemed to come closer to anunderstanding of the life principle than the mechanists who dissected life before trying tounderstand it.”6But as always, he was fascinated by the concrete in neurology the complex-ity of the nerve tracts, for example, and the ingenious arrangement of the ganglia.Reich did very well in his courses. By his second year he was tutoring first-year stu-dents, which eliminated the need for any help from his brother, and afforded him consider-able pride in his early and complete financial independence.The most important event during Reich’s years at medical school was his encounterwith psychoanalysis. How this came about is an interesting story in itself. Grete Bibring (néeLehner), a woman in her seventies when I interviewed her, with a distinguished career in psy-choanalysis, recalled the setting in which Reich first heard in detail about psychoanalysis. Afirst-year medical student in 1919, she was sitting next to Reich and to Edward Bibring, herfuture husband, at an anatomy lecture. The room was ill-heated because of the fuel short-age, and Willy and Edward wore their Army overcoats, both being too poor to purchasecivilian winter clothes. During the lecture, Otto Fenichel, a fellow student (later to becomean analyst of renown), passed around a note urging an extracurricular seminar on subjectsnot covered by the regular medical curriculum, to be run by the students themselves. Willy,Grete, Edward, and several others who have not been identified responded and joinedFenichel in initiating and planning the seminar7.In his published account (1942) of the start of this seminar, Reich omitted to citeFenichel as the originator,which is not surprising since the two men were to quarrel bitter-ly in 1934 and so break off a close friendship that had lasted for sixteen years. Further, Reichdescribed the seminar as being specifically devoted to sexology, whereas Grete Bibring stat-ed that it was devoted to “new” topics. However that may be, there is no doubt that sex wasone of the main topics not covered by the regular medical curriculum.Early in the new seminar,the students invited a psychoanalyst to give several talks.Later Reich recalled that while he learned a great deal from these lectures, he objected to theway the analyst, as well as other guest lecturers, discussed sexuality. “Sexuality, in my experi-ence, was something different from the thing they discussed. Those first lectures [by the ana-lyst and others] I attended made sexuality seem bizarre and strange.”8Reich had already arrived at his own views about the importance of sexuality. Adiary entry for March 1, 1919, reads: “Perhaps my own morality objects to it. However, frommy own experience, and from observation of myself and others, I have become convincedthat sexuality is the center around which revolves the whole of social life as well as the innerlife ofthe individual.”9"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"4 : Becoming a Psychoanalyst: 1918-192061éditionsles atomes de l’âmeReich’s initial discomfort with the discussions did not keep him from being veryactive in the group. By the fall of 1919, according to his own account, he was elected leaderof the seminar, and helped organize further groups for the study of various branches ofsexology: endocrinology, biology, physiology, and, especially, psychoanalysis. Grete Bibringsaid that the chairmanship of the seminar rotated among the members and that it was asomewhat less complex organization than Reich claimed. Reich always had a tendency toexpand on the organizational depth of undertakings he was currently associated with. Inlater years he might, for example, have one or two biologists working with him and describethem as practically a department of biology.The seminar led Reich directly to Freud’s writings. Immediately he was enthralled,and especially drawn to Freud’s concept of infantile sexuality, which made sex a much larg-er force than simply adult genitality. One could trace its developmental aspects and see inadult perversions and neurotic conflicts a fixation on or regression to earlier modes of sex-ual functioning. This viewpoint was syntonic with Reich’s own experience of the powerfulchildhood drama that Freud so emphasized: the boy’s sexual love for his mother, and hisrivalrous hatred toward his father.In a wider sense, Freud’s method of thought greatly appealed to Reich because ittended to combine the two strands ofvitalism and mechanistic science that Reich hadalready encountered in his own medical training. Freud was not afraid, for example, toaddress major problems of human emotional life even if they could not be studied in thelaboratory. He was prepared to postulate a force—libido, or the energy of the sexualinstinct—even though it could not be investigated experimentally or measured quantitative-ly. At the same time, Freud the empiricist studied the transformations of this postulatedenergy as carefully as possible. Wherever he could, he used the models and language ofphysics, speaking, for example, of “cathexes” and “displacements” of energy, of the “quan-titative” strength of an idea, of emotion as a phenomenon of “energy discharge.” Moreover,he hoped that one day the concept of libido would be more than a metaphor or an analo-gy, that it would be rooted in a biochemical matrix.It was not surprising that in Freud’s young science Reich found that fusion of soft,amorphous feeling and hard, empirical fact which he was searching for so assiduously in hismedical studies.On a more personal level, psychoanalysis in part represented for him a com-bination ofhis parents and his dual identifications with them: his mother, who representedfeeling, and, in a sense, died for feeling; and his father, who represented the vigorous, prac-tical,tangible world of reality.The impact of Freud’s personality on Reich matched the impact of his work. Manyyears later,Reich was to describe his visit in 1919 to Freud and others in order to obtain lit-erature for the extracurricular seminar:Freud’s personality made the strongest and most lasting impression.

Each one of the others expressed in his attitude some role: that of the pro-fessor, of the great Menschenkenner, or the distinguished scientist. Freud spoke tome like an ordinary human being. He had piercingly intelligent eyes; they did nottry to penetrate the listener’s eyes in a visionary pose; they simply looked into theworld, straight and honest... . His manner of speaking was quick, to the point andlively. The movements of his hands were natural. Everything he did and said wasshot through with tints of irony. I had come there in a state of trepidation and leftwith a feeling of pleasure and friendliness. That was the starting point of fourteenyears of intensive work in and for psychoanalysis. At the end, I experienced a bit-ter disappointment in Freud, a disappointment which, I am happy to say, did notlead to hatred or rejection. On the contrary, today I have a better and higher esti-mation of Freud’s achievement than in those days when I was his worshipful disci-ple. I am happy to have been his pupil for such a long time without premature crit-icism, and with a full devotion to his cause10.I quote in some detail because Reich’s intense admiration for Freud as a man wasto be an important part of what psychoanalysis as a whole meant to him. When Reich actu-ally met Freud in 1919, he was quite on his own and proudly so. However, as he expressedit in 1948, he had never been really close to his own father, and Freud represented the kindof mentor and father substitute he so badly needed during this period.11And what betterexemplar could he have found? Freud’s interests corresponded closely to his own, not onlyin terms of science and psychology but also sociologically, for Freud’s work was fraught witheducational and group implications. In addition, the example of Freud’s lonely strugglesmust have inspired the young Reich, seeking a heroic destiny, who strove to avoid the “triv-iality of the everyday.” For though Freud’s work revolved around his office, he had met morethan his due ofhate-filled abuse. Indeed, Freud saw himself primarily as a “conquistador,”and his letters to his colleagues about outright hostility to analysis on one front,covert resist-ance on another,and genuine victory on still another often sound like communiquésbetween a commander-in-chief and his battlefield generals. As a man and a teacher, then,Freud had many attributes that could supply for the young Reich the inspiring but steady-ing, soaring but disciplined “benevolent presence” (to use Erik Erikson’s felicitous phraseagain) he longed for.On his side, Freud must have been quite impressed by Reich. Freud permitted theyoung medical student to start seeing analytic patients in early 1920 (possibly even late in1919) and referred several cases to him. Reich was not unique in starting psychoanalyticpractice at so young an age (twenty-two or twenty-three) and without formal training, butthere were not many in this category. In the summer of 1920, Reich was admitted as a guestmember of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society; in the fall of that year, he presented a paperon Ibsen’s Peer Gyntto the Society, after which he became a regular member12.The speed with which Reich became an analyst was not solely a function of his ownintelligence,energy, and commitment, but also of the milieu. For psychoanalysis did not"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"4 : Becoming a Psychoanalyst: 1918-192063éditionsles atomes de l’âmethen have the formidable organizational structure it was to develop some years later, withthe requirements of psychiatric residency, training analysis, analytic seminars, and casesupervision. In 1920, if one had Freud’s blessing an important “if,” since Freud controlledmost of the referrals that came to the new specialty of psychoanalysis one could begin ana-lytic practice with virtually no formal training. One was expected to steep oneself in the ana-lytic literature and required to present an acceptable paper in order to become a member ofthe Society, but little else. Ironically, Reich himself was to make a significant contribution notleast through the elaboration of “character analysis” to lengthening the apprenticeshiprequired of analytic candidates.The significance of Freud and psychoanalysis to Reich becomes even more appar-ent if we take a closer look at Reich’s personality and private life during this period.Those who knew Reich as a young medical student around 1919-20 focus on hisvitality and brilliance. For some, it was not only his forceful nature but also a kind of rude-ness that impressed them. Grete Bibring, musing about the young Reich, spoke with a mix-ture of fondness, admiration, and disdain. She commented on his intelligence, his eagernessto learn, and his capacity to “soak up everything.” At the same time she found him lesssophisticated and less knowledgeable in terms of general culture than many of her fellowstudents. She also felt he was quite impressionable and cited an example from around theyear 1920. Reich had a patient in analysis who was a Communist. One day Willy excitedlycame to Grete and Edward, exclaiming that Communists weren’t necessarily fools. Since thiswas hardly news to the young couple, they did not share Willy’s sense of great discovery. Astrain on the relationship was Reich’s competitiveness with Edward Bibring, for Willy, too,was drawn to the attractive, spirited, and intellectual Grete a romantic interest she did notreciprocate13.Willy’s colleagues also criticized, initially with good humor, later with more acerbity,his tendency to dominate groups. In the student seminar, for example, a story tells howReich,as leader or temporary leader,was outlining a series of presentations for the comingweeks.He meant to say that after he had presented a certain topic, another member wouldspeak on something else. Instead, he made the slip: “Nach mir, ich komme” (After me, I come).The group burst out laughing and someone said: “That’s the trouble with you, Willy—‘Afterme,Icome.’”14Some ofthe same personal qualities, as well as others, are revealed in Reich’s rela-tionship with Lia Laszky. Laszky recalled meeting Reich when both were lab partners in afirst-year anatomy course. Reich was taking an accelerated program that permitted him tocomplete the regular six-year curriculum in four years. He repeatedly urged Laszky to do thesame so that they could continue working together. “So like a fool I did. I wasn’t as smartas he was, I wasn’t as determined. It was all too much for me.” Later she was to drop out ofmedical school altogether15.Lia Laszky felt that Reich at that time was both “fascinating and abhorrent”: fasci-nating because ofhis vitality,his radiant interests, and his personal charm during good"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth64éditionsles atomes de l’âmemoods; abhorrent because he could apply such pressure to induce her to do what he want-ed and because, in his bad moods, he could be so touchy and easily angered. In spite of hermixed feelings, for a period she was very much under his influence. If he failed in persuad-ing her to finish medical school, he succeeded in arousing her lasting interest in psychoanaly-sis.During Reich’s first year of medical school, Laszky had been helpful to him in avery practical way. He had little money and was often hungry. Through her father, who wasa doctor, her family had access to food, so she shared with Reich the daily lunch she broughtfrom home. But Reich also needed supper. Lia persuaded her mother to give her bigger andbigger lunches, ostensibly to assuage her ever more ravenous hunger. Finally her parentsbegan to worry about her health and arranged for her to have a medical exam. Lia then toldthem the truth. Her father invited Reich to call and gave him a small allowance. Not longafterward, Lia’s interest in psychoanalysis developed under Reich’s influence. Her father, abitter opponent of Freud’s work, was outraged and blamed Reich. The allowance was cutoff and he was no longer welcomed in the Laszky home.This incident is very illustrative of the way Reich dealt with help from others. Reichis assisted by someone. He takes it more or less for granted, at least if the person does notseem to be making any great sacrifice.As Laszky says: “He wasn’t worried that he often atemy whole lunch.” He undoubtedly felt that she didn’t have to worry about her next meal, hedid. And he also appears to have been quite prepared to take an allowance from Lia’s fatherwithout any obligation to defer to her father in a major way. Reich was interested in psycho-analysis, Lia should be, and to hell with what her father thought. Conversely, Reich himselfwas often very generous to people in need so long as he could give freely. If he was expect-ed to give, it could be quite a different story, as we shall see in later contexts.In spite of the family opposition, or perhaps in part because of it, the friendshipbetween Willy and Lia continued to develop. Whether Reich was in love with her we do notknow,though it appears that at one point he wanted to marry her. For all his fascination, LiaLaszky was not in love with him “I was a virgin and he was a steamroller.” She felt that forhim the conquest was more the issue than love:conquering this attractive, vivacious, intelli-gent young girl, this virgin, this daughter of a physician, this in many ways reluctant woman.In fact,they did not have intercourse at that time. According to Laszky, “I was too fright-ened, too inhibited.” Her refusal angered Reich, but it did not stop his pursuit of her16.Another characteristic element ofReich’s personality was revealed in his relation-ship with Lia: his intense jealousy. These feelings were quite realistically aroused by a strongcompetitor, the conductor Hans Swarowski, whom Lia had met during her first year of med-ical school.Swarowski wanted to marry her, and over time it became clear that she preferredhim to Willy. Her fiancé asked her to give up medical school so she would be free to travelwith him. Willy did not surrender easily, but kept pursuing her, once even surprising her byappearing unannounced on a train when she was on her way to visit Swarowski. Willy kepttelling her that she was made to be a psychiatrist and that she couldn’t leave him. This dualappeal to the woman he cared for was to recur throughout Reich’s life: Be with me and do"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"4 : Becoming a Psychoanalyst: 1918-192065éditionsles atomes de l’âmewhat I am doing! However close Reich may have been to Lia, he was also close to other women. Oneimportant friendship was with a young nursery-school teacher, described by those who knewher as soft, pretty, not especially intellectual, and—unlike Lia—very much in love with Reich.The girl died suddenly of an illegal abortion17.If Reich was the man involved and the evidence suggests that he was the eventmust have had an enormous impact on him. We know that he felt implicated in his moth-er’s death. Now his relationship with the nursery-school teacher repeated the disastrous con-sequences of sex outside marriage, and he was once again deeply involved. Moreover, if hismother’s fate helped determine the broad background of his later efforts to free genitality,so this experience would seem to have been closely related to his later strong interest in aparticular sex reform: the legalization of abortion.The relationships with Lia Laszky and the nursery-school teacher were serious ones.There were also lighter, more casual affairs. Judging from the reports of women who knewhim at that time, Reich appears to have had some need to prove his masculinity, to be some-thing of a womanizer. The atmosphere among his friends was quite permissive.Psychoanalysis was used as a rationale (some would say a rationalization) justifying a non-monogamous way of life. However, Reich and many of his friends were old-fashioned inthe sense that they were intensely serious about their studies and careers. They might havecasual affairs, but they also worked hard from early morning until late at night. Reich andOtto Fenichel, especially, were regarded as intellectual leaders among the analytically orient-ed students; Otto was admired for his encyclopedic knowledge and Reich for his capacity tocite just the telling case or concept from the writings of Freud and other analysts.Along with many of his friends, Reich was involved with the Social Democraticyouth movement. Its student wing was a loose association of young, largely middle-classmen and women who were devoted to leftist politics, the new in the arts and psychology, theright of the young to determine their own lives, and freedom from “dull, bourgeois” cultur-al standards in general and conventional mores in particular. (One of the worst cursesamong this group was to label someone “Victorian.”) The youth movement was importanton a personal level for Reich because it provided the peer-group support and activities solacking in his early life. It appears to have been Reich’s first major political involvement—not in any very organized or highly theoretical way, but as part of the total social milieu. Hewould have been exposed, for example, to the Kinderfreunde, a Social Democratic organi-zation devoted to the education of homeless pre-adolescents. In addition to the youthmovement, there was also a workers’ youth group to which Reich lectured on psychoanaly-sis in the early twenties. The leaders in the Social Democratic Party had a large vision anddid not confine themselves to narrow economic and political questions. They wanted towrest education from Catholic hands and influence the minds of the young. The idea wasto develop the whole person; the aim, to build a “socialist man.”Later,in about 1927 or so, Reich’s political interests were to become intense, theo-retically informed, and organizationally engaged women’s rights, the rights of youth, com-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth66éditionsles atomes de l’âmemunal facilities for homeless young people, connections between political and educationalchange, anti-religious orientations. By 1919 or 1920, the seeds of these interests had beenplanted, partly through the youth movement.A final point concerning the Social Democratic group. If Reich found in Freud therole model par excellence of intellectual daring, he found in the youth movement supportfor his own emotional and social adventurousness. These young people of the right as wellas the left were permeated with a Nietzschean scorn for well-trod, narrow paths of exis-tence, with a love of nature, with a yearning for “something more” than the lives of theirparents. On the political right, such yearnings were to degenerate into the fierce nationalismthat characterized Nazism. But even in this extreme distortion Reich discerned a genuine,surging feeling, the kind of primary emotion he would always honor even when he con-demned its corrupt expressions.Studies, love, and politics were not Reich’s sole concerns during this period. Heremained interested in physical activity, joining an Alpine club not long after his arrival inVienna. He also joined the Schonberg music association, following up on a childhood inter-est when he had studied the piano. For a brief period in Vienna, he appears to have begunto play the cello, stimulated by Lia, herself a talented cellist. Throughout his life he lovedmusic.Not surprisingly, the tempestuous, struggling, innovative, and many-facetedBeethoven was his favorite composer18.It was also typical of Reich’s life, and the lives of many of his friends, that therewere no sharp distinctions between work and leisure time or among various interests. Onecelebrated a political event at a party, one’s medical school and extracurricular pursuits inter-laced, and love itself was an arena where some of the home truths of the new psychologi-cal knowledge were most fully revealed.In hearing people talk about the young, social Reich, one senses a sparkling personat the center of the groups in which he was involved. However, in play as in work Reich hadto be at the center. For example, after animatedly discussing how fascinating and lively Reichcould be,Gisela Stein,a friend ofReich’s and wife of the internist Paul Stein, reported thathe frequently was “unbearably intolerant” when confronted with disagreement: “He had todo everything best when he went skiing, he had to be the best and everybody had to ski hisway.”For all his capacity to be at the center of things, Reich often felt like an outsider.His choice ofPeer Gynt,the quintessential outsider, as the subject for his first analytic paperwas no accident. What contributed to this feeling of alienation on Reich’s part at the verytime when things seemed to be going so well, when, unlike Peer Gynt, his own burstingstrength did not consist simply ofdreams and longings but was being channeled into pro-ductive outlets? I have already commented that his experience of sexuality was quite different fromthe way many of his teachers and peers such as Lia Laszky felt about it. It seems apparentthat Reich’s intensity and creativity also served to separate him from most people he was toknow then and later. At the same time, in spite of professional and personal successes, his"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"4 : Becoming a Psychoanalyst: 1918-192067éditionsles atomes de l’âmeself-confidence remained shaky. His country background may have contributed to the out-sider feeling, for many Viennese wished that the refugees from the former Easternprovinces would go home. His unusual social situation as a child the “crown prince” of afeudal estate, not permitted to play with most of his peers may have contributed to his dif-ficulties with the easy give-and-take of normal friendship even while he yearned for it somuch. His psoriasis undoubtedly undermined his physical self-confidence: some of thewomen who knew him during this period said that while others found him attractive, theythemselves were put off by his “acne.”There were obviously deeper factors involved in his feelings of alienation. It is notdifficult to trace them to his childhood family conflicts. His intense rivalrous feelings towardhis powerful, domineering father were stimulated by his mother’s doting love and her andhis own abuse at the hands of the father. Inflamed through his (and his father’s) defeat bythe tutor, there arose an extraordinary sensitivity to being defeated, put down, or otherwisemade to look small. One way to avoid such a repetition was to take the dominant position.Subordinacy was only tolerable when, as in the case of his relationship with Freud, he couldidolize a somewhat distant, much older mentor who treated him well, indeed, as a kind offavorite. His mother’s “betrayal” of her loving son illumined the intense jealousy he experi-enced toward women and his need to prove himself—his attractiveness, his worth—by win-ning many women. And while his self-perception of being “different” had many positivebases—energy, creativity, and health—it also had a foundation in feelings of guilt from hisrole in his mother’s death, feelings that led him to believe he was a “marked” man, who mustlive an extraordinary life to redeem the suffering he had witnessed (and perhaps caused) atsuch close quarters. Finally, it is worth noting that these painful feelings about his familybackground are further revealed by the fact that during this period Reich did not discuss hisfamily even with those, such as Lia, he was closest to.Whatever his personal conflicts, Reich generally was able to maintain his capacityto work effectively. There appears to have been only one brief period when the weight ofthe past severely interfered with his capacity to function. In the same article (published in1920) in which he presented his childhood trauma in disguised form, Reich also outlinedsome ofthe conflicts he felt around 1919. He described the “patient” (himself) as sufferingfrom states ofdepression and rumination that led him to lose all interest in his studies. Hefeared speaking in public lest he make a fool of himself, become all “choked up.” He tend-ed to want to be alone and to dwell on small, everyday errors, which he magnified into a“huge case.”Reich also reported that the onset of these feelings of depression occurred in con-nection with a relationship to a girl who was “intellectually very much below him” (the nurs-ery-school teacher?) and whom he suspected of being unfaithful to him at one point. Therethe “analyst” (Reich) interjected to say that, in his opinion, the “patient’s” suspicion waswithout objective foundation. Also, the “patient” suffered from a restless quest for an idealsexual partner,with feelings ofdisappointment following any actual experience. (The “ana-lyst” later related this quest to the patient’s unconscious search for the “perfect” mate, i.e.,"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth68éditionsles atomes de l’âmehis mother.) This personal crisis around 1919 undoubtedly further fixed Reich’s intense interestin psychoanalysis. Together with other evidence, the “case history” indicates that he did infact have some brief analytic therapy around this time. His first analyst was Isidor Sadger19,one of Freud’s earliest Viennese associates. In the early 1920s, Reich underwent a secondanalysis, this time with Paul Federn, which also did not last long20. Federn was a prominentearly disciple of Freud’s.Reich may also have undergone analysis for training purposes. Although a person-al analysis did not become a prerequisite for practice until 1926, Freud urged “very youngcandidates who came to him for advice ... that they be analyzed themselves.”21It is reason-able to conjecture that he also gave Reich this advice. I would further assume that Reich’sfirst choice of analyst was Freud, but that the latter’s relatively high fees and his reluctanceto take Viennese students into therapy with him would have made this outcome unlikely.There is definite evidence that some years later Reich very much wanted to be in treatmentwith Freud.In later years Reich never, to my knowledge, talked about his experiences as an ana-lytic patient. We do not know why his analyses were so brief. Perhaps Reich, like the“patient” he described, broke off treatment because of difficulties in even discussing hischildhood trauma. Perhaps there were conflicts about technique or personality clashes. BothSadger and Federn came to dislike Reich bitterly.In any case, the intensity of the problems that appear to have led Reich into his firstanalysis could not have lasted long, judging from his extremely rapid progress during thoseearly Vienna years. By the end of 1920 he was already a practicing analyst, with two moreyears ofmedical school to complete.He no longer had to scrounge for the means to livesince now he could support himselfthrough his practice. In 1920 his living quarters, whichalso served as an office, were on Berggasse, the same street where Freud resided. He hadfound the beginning lines ofhis life work, and in Sigmund Freud the most significant rolemodel ofhis career. Whatever his conflicts, Reich had demonstrated that he could make itin the world.And he had at least taken some first steps in understanding, and redeeming,the tragedies of his early life."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"69éditionsles atomes de l’âmePART IIIReich as Insider—Building a Career and Marriage: 1920-1926"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth70éditionsles atomes de l’âme5 : Reich’s Work on the Impulsive Character: 1922-1924In later years, Reich used to speak of his work as existing outside the framework ofpresent-day scientific disciplines. And, indeed, Reich’s concepts of genitality and orgasticpotency were, as we shall see, rejected even by Freud, to whom Reich was first attracted pre-cisely because of the way he addressed issues of sexuality.This latent “outsideness” was to become apparent only over time. During the earlyand mid-i92os, Reich saw himself—and was regarded by others as functioning very muchwithin the psychoanalytic movement.Following Reich’s graduation from medical school in 1922, he kept up the variedbut unified effort that hadcharacterized his earlier student years. In addition to his privatepractice ofanalysis,he undertook in 1922 postgraduate study in neuropsychiatry at theUniversity of Vienna Clinic, headed by the neuropsychiatrist Professor Wagner von Jauregg,who later won the Nobel Prize for the malarial treatment of general paresis. Reich’s work atthis clinic gave him the opportunity to study various kinds of psychotic illnesses and stim-ulated what would become a lifelong interest in schizophrenia. He also appreciated workingunder the famed von Jauregg, although the latter was not sympathetic to psychoanalysis andmissed no opportunity to poke fun at it. It is worth noting here that as a student Reich hadthe good fortune to work with the most eminent, organically oriented psychiatrist of theperiod as well as the leading psychoanalyst.Reich’s thorough professional training is notable on another count. Young peopletoday have picked up the anti-establishment aspects of his work, its “outsideness,” as anexcuse for not acquiring traditional education or formal training. Reich cannot be used as amodel for this kind ofrebellion. Despite his defiance of taboos, throughout his life he wasintent on learning all he could from others.Moreover, Reich valued what he sometimes called a “good old-fashioned educa-tion.” As a young man he was ambitious for public validation. He wanted proper credentialsas he wanted the respect ofhis peers and superiors. And for all his outspokenness on mat-ters of principle, he could exercise discretion in order not to alienate unnecessarily thoseimportant to him.For example,at von Jauregg’s clinic he would sometimes omit from hispatient charts mention of sexual symbolism, since to include analytic interpretations wouldonly invite the ridicule of his chief.During this period,Reich also began working in the newly established ViennaPsychoanalytic Polyclinic. He was to work part time there for eight years, initially as a firstassistant, later as assistant chief, with the senior analyst Eduard Hitschmann serving as chief"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"5 : Reich’s Work on the Impulsive Character: 1922-192471éditionsles atomes de l’âmethroughout. Reich’s work was extremely important in furthering his social interests since theclinic served laborers, farmers, students, and others with low earnings who could ill affordprivate treatment. Not only did he have the opportunity to deal with the emotional prob-lems of the poor; he could note how economic conditions contributed to and exacerbatedtheir suffering—social implications that were later significant to him. As was so characteris-tic of Reich, a given opportunity was useful in several directions at the same time. From amore narrowly psychiatric and psychoanalytic viewpoint, the clinic population was rich inpatients not usually seen by analysts persons whose diagnosis was “impulsive character” (aterm coined by Franz Alexander) or what today would more likely be termed “character dis-order” or “borderline” patients.Until this poly clinic opened, psychoanalysis had been available mainly to middle-class patients suffering from the so-called symptom neuroses, for example, patients withobsessive-compulsive complaints such as endless hand- washing, or hysterical complaintssuch as a paralysis of a part of the body without any organic basis. Reich’s study of theimpulsive character provided a nice transition to a broader study of the personality, for thismalady was typified not by specific symptoms so much as by a chaotically disorganized styleof life. These patients, who had frequently been diagnosed as “psychopaths,” were oftenregarded as more “bad”than “sick.” They were frequently anti-social and showed self-destructive tendencies in the form of criminality, addictions, outbursts of uncontrollablerage, or suicide attempts. Even today exceedingly difficult to treat, such people are general-ly considered “troublemakers” and are tossed back and forth among the courts, prisons, andmental health centers.In 1925 Reich published his first book, a monograph entitled Der TriebhafteCharakter(The Impulsive Character)1.As he was later to do so frequently, Reich began withsome broad theoretical issues. Following Freud’s direction in the 1920s, which gave moreemphasis to the ego, the character, in contrast to the earlier period of psychoanalysis, whichhad focused heavily on unconscious impulses and wishes, Reich argued for a “single, system-atic theory of character ... a psychic embryology.” Put more simply, he stressed that we donot understand how the variation in human personality comes about. True, fragments of apsychoanalytic embryology existed. Freud, Ernest Jones, and Karl Abraham had posited thatpersons fixated at the anal stage ofdevelopment often showed specific character traits suchas frugality, orderliness, and stubbornness. But why one person with such a fixation devel-oped a symptom, such as compulsive hand-washing, while another showed only the charac-ter trait ofcleanliness, was not clear.Reich then went on to define the impulsive character and to differentiate it diagnos-tically from the symptom neuroses,on the one hand,and the psychoses, on the other. Hesaw the impulsive character as a transitional stage from neuroses to psychoses (well con-veyed by the current term “borderline” case). The further details of his differentiations neednot concern us here save to note that Reich placed a heavy emphasis on the fact that theimpulsive character,unlike the symptom neurotic, often rationalized his illness. He would,for example, blame others for his unbridled excesses and not perceive himself as emotion-"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth72éditionsles atomes de l’âmeally disturbed. Also, we might note that Reich’s fine distinctions regarding these variousill-nesses make clear why in the early 1920s Paul Federn called Reich the best diagnosticianamong the younger analysts2.A substantial section of the monograph is devoted to an elucidation of early child-hood development of the impulsive character. Reich posited that impulsive persons often,as small children, initially experienced considerable permissiveness. Then, suddenly, impulsegratification was followed by a belated but “ruthless” and “traumatic” frustration.The childhood sexual history of the impulsive character contained strong stimula-tion, severe conflicts, and the development of weak or unstable ego defenses. According topsychoanalytic theory, almost all patients have experienced castration threats and the wit-nessing or overhearing of the primal scene. Reich argued that the impulsive character suf-fered these events in an especially blatant form:Impulsive characters have lived out their sexuality not only very early, but also withfully conscious incest wishes... . Owing to a lack of supervision, such patients seeand grasp far more of adult sexual life than do the simple neurotics. The latencyperiod is activated minimally or not at all... . Puberty is ushered in with extremebreakthroughs ofthe sexual drive. Neither masturbation nor intercourse, which aretaken up at a very early age, can afford relief, for the whole libidinal organization istorn apart by disappointment and guilt feelings3.We might consider here the significance of the similarities between Reich’s descrip-tion of childhood factors in the development of the impulsive character and his own per-sonal history: the combination of stimulation and indulgence, on the one hand, and harshpunishment, on the other; the exposure to striking “primal scene” experiences; the absenceofa latency period; and the conscious awareness of incest wishes in puberty.These factors lead one to think there may have been strong inner reasons forReich’s choice of the impulsive character as subject of his first detailed psychoanalytic inves-tigation. Reich could certainly act very impulsively and, on occasion, was given to unbridledrages.To give but a few examples: Gisela Stein recalls him storming out of the Steins’ apart-ment following a political argument in the early 1920s; Reich’s third wife, Use Ollendorff,remembers his towering rages in the 19405 and 19508 when confronted with bills he con-sidered excessive or insufficiently controlled by Use in terms of the quantity or quality ofwork done; and I myself remember during therapy in 1948 his fury when I told him of cer-tain criticisms made by a person he detested.These outbursts were often provoked by various hurts and insults, but they wereoften disproportionate to the cause. And whatever the justification in terms of externalprovocation, it was also clear that at times Reich used such justification to rationalize his out-burst much as he described the impulsive character explaining away his excesses. On otheroccasions,he would be genuinely mortified after such an outburst and would immediatelyapologize to the person he had abused."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"5 : Reich’s Work on the Impulsive Character: 1922-192473éditionsles atomes de l’âmeOne further point should be made about the development of Reich’s impulsivecharacteristics—a point that is in accordance with his general theoretical approach to thedevelopment of character traits. In the first section of the monograph, Reich, followingFreud, emphasizes the role of identification in the development of the ego: “The processof identification holds the key to the characterological interpretation of personality.” InReich’s case, his impulsive tendencies can be seen as the result of childhood stimulation andrepression; but they can also be viewed in the light of his identification with his father. ForLeon, too, was given to fits of unbridled and rationalized rage, especially when his jealousywas aroused. Throughout his life, Reich was aware of the problematic aspects of his per-sonality that stemmed from his identification with Leon.I hypothesize, then, that during the early 1920s Reich was involved in his own psy-choanalysis, partly with the help of Isidor Sadger and Paul Federn, but largely (I conjecture)on his own. As his first autobiographical sketch informs us, Reich was acutely aware of—and sometimes very troubled by—many aspects of his own life history. It seems likely thatthis awareness of his own conflicts and the environmental matrix within which they devel-oped alerted him to similar constellations in patients. Clearly, his self-awareness was furtherheightened by the work with impulsive characters in particular.It would be erroneous to use the preceding linkage of themes in his life with hiswork on the impulsive character to substantiate the accusation that some have made againstReich: that he was a psychopath. Those who thought of him in this fashion had their ownreasons and problems. The complexity of Reich’s personality could provide a field day forthe diagnostician. My own aim is something different: to trace his development and to showhow creatively—and sometimes destructively—he used what was within him.In the monograph, Reich’s tone is in fact cool and objective, showing considerabledistance between himself and his subject matter. These pages reveal him primarily as a sharp,up-and-coming young analyst whose primary goal, along good Freudian lines, is to under-stand rather than to cure. Indeed, compared with Reich’s later clinical works, it is strikinghow relatively free the monograph is of any suggestions for treatment. Although he makespassing reference to the poor economic conditions surrounding the impulsive characters,there is none ofthe zeal for social reform that suffuses later publications.The monograph is furthermore instructive because it shows how slowly Reicharrived at the concepts most closely associated with his name. In the late 1920s, he wasessentially to redefine Karl Abraham’s notion of the “genital character.” He would also for-mulate pedagogical notions describing the possibility of an upbringing different from either“normal” repressiveness or the exotic mixture of indulgence and punishment that impulsivepersons experienced in childhood.However, he first had to sort out the more conflict-ridden aspects of his own child-hood experiences and the experiences of impulsive characters. For thatkind of sexual per-missiveness led to all kinds of problems. And so in 1925, as in 1920, we find Reich still close-ly identified with many traditional analytic notions.He believed in the desirability of strongego defenses against sexual wishes and impulses. He also emphasized the cultural value of"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Myron SharafFury On Earth74éditionsles atomes de l’âmethe latency period an absence or strong diminution of sexual feelings between the ages ofaround six and the onset of puberty. Before Reich could transcend psychoanalytic formula-tions on these matters, he had to comprehend more fully the strengths as well as the weak-nesses in his own background and personality.As I have indicated, Reich’s main interests in the monograph per se were diagnos-tic and etiological rather than therapeutic. His chief suggestion for treatment was to uncov-er the unconscious of impulsive patients very carefully and particularly slowly.At the end of the monograph, Reich argued for more research on how to treat theimpulsive character. Such study would require an institutional setting to protect the patientfrom his or her uncontrollable impulses at the same time as it offered treatment. Few suchsettings existed. Impulsive patients were initially hospitalized because of a destructive orself-destructive act; they would then be discharged, only to be readmitted after another, usu-ally more dangerous outburst. Finally, they often succeeded in killing themselves or theywere given custodial care. What Reich wrote of this deplorable course for the patient of the1920s could be repeated, with slight modifications, to describe current treatment today.The Impulsive Characterwon Reich considerable recognition from his mentors andcolleagues. Freud congratulated Reich directly, and in a letter to Paul Federn described themonograph as “full of valuable content.”4Indeed,he thought so highly ofit that he urgedFedern, then vice-chairman of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society and Freud’s right-handman in organizational matters, to see that Reich was appointed to the Society’s executivecommittee. More recently, an authority has called it a classic that does for the impulsive char-acter what Freud’s case history of Dora does for the hysteric5.The monograph would undoubtedly have received much wider acclaim were itmore readily available. The German edition has been out of print for many years, and thepiece was not available in English until 1970, when it appeared in the Journal of Orgonomy.Atleast one competent observer, with no ax to grind, believes that it would have been translat-ed much earlier were it not for the quarrels that subsequently developed between Reich andthe psychoanalytic establishment6."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"6 : Reich’s Early Work on Character Analysis: 1920-1926By the early 1920s, Reich had acquired considerable exposure to neurotic patients,the psychotically ill, and impulsive or borderline characters—all good experience for anyyoung psychiatrist. If Reich’s most careful diagnostic work was done with impulsive persons,his concern with treatment began with the neurotic patients, whom he saw in private analyt-ic practice.There were few guidelines as to how an analysis should be conducted, but this lackof requirements and guidelines had its advantages for the young Reich. He could plunge intothe practice of analysis directly; he could learn to think for himself; and he was not requiredto absorb a good deal from others that he would later have to unlearn. He was spared theendless seminars,supervised cases,and so on that today are required of analytic candidates,with the result that they often are unable to abandon the student role, with all its infantiliz-ing features, until about forty. Yet another paradox is that Reich was one of the main con-tributors to expanding the analytic curriculum for students.In his own writings, Reich stressed the deficiencies rather than the advantages ofhis early years as an analyst:There was hardly any discussion of psychoanalytic technique, a lack which I feltvery keenly in my work with patients. There was neither a training institute nor anorganized curriculum. The counsel to be had from older colleagues was meager.“Just go on analyzing patiently,” they would say, “it’ll come.” What would come, andhow,one did not quite know.One of the most difficult points was the handling ofpatients who were severely inhibited or even remained silent. Later analysts havenever experienced this desolate being at sea in matters of technique. When a patientfailed to produce associations, if he did not “want to have” dreams or did not pro-duce associations, one would sit there, helpless, for hours. The technique of analy-sis ofresistances, although theoretically formulated, was not practiced. ... If onetold the patient, “You have a resistance,” he would look at one uncomprehending-ly.Ifone told him that he “defended himself against his unconscious,” one was notany better off. Trying to convince him that his silence or resistance was senseless,that it really was distrust or fear, was somewhat more intelligent, but no more fruit-ful. Yet, the older colleagues kept saying: “Just keep on analyzing.”1In later years Reich spoke even more contemptuously of the “older colleagues,”75éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Freud excepted. In an interview with Kurt Eissler, Secretary of the Freud Archives, Reichdescribed the atmosphere of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society as very boring, and statedthat I acted “like a shark in a pond of carps.”2When Reich had questions, he tended to go directly to Freud for help. However,Reich felt that while Freud had a marvelous capacity for solving complicated situations the-oretically, he was not of great technical assistance3. Freud, too, advised Reich to be patient.He warned against “therapeutic ambitiousness.” Reich later wrote that it took some yearsbefore he understood Freud’s point that “premature therapeutic ambitiousness is not con-ducive to the discovery of new facts.”4With Freud’s approval, Reich took his first practical step toward systematizing thetherapeutic technique. In 1922 he suggested the establishment of a technical seminar, to beled by a senior analyst but designed to meet the explicit needs of young analysts. The mainmethod of the seminar would be the systematic study of individual cases in analytic treat-ment. Eduard Hitschmann was the first leader of the seminar, Hermann Nunberg the sec-ond. In 1924, at the age of twenty-seven, Reich took over the leadership, which he main-tained until 1930, when he left for Berlin.To establish an atmosphere of candor and productivity within the seminar, Reichtook several steps. From the first, he proposed that, with the exception of the leader, theseminar should be confined strictly to younger members of the Psychoanalytic Society. Inthis way the more inexperienced analysts could vent their doubts and troubles without wor-rying about the opinion of the more senior members. When Reich became leader, he estab-lished the requirement that participants present only treatment failures, so that there wouldbe no glib smoothing over of difficulties to impress one’s colleagues with successes. Reichalso set an example by initially presenting some ofhis own treatment failures.Reich was dissatisfied with the way cases were presented during the first two yearsof the technical seminar. The procedure had been for the presenter to fill most of the allot-ted time with the patient’s life history;then, in the ensuing discussion, some rather hit-or-miss suggestions for future treatment would be made. As leader, Reich developed the pro-cedure ofhaving the presenter give only as much of the case history as was necessary forclarification of the technical problems.Here we see Reich as teacher and organizer, insisting on a system in the ratherinchoate field ofpsychoanalysis. He focused directly on the problem of the choice pointsfor the therapist, his options at any given moment. It is interesting that Reich’s method ofrunning the seminar was very similar to the case method of teaching favored today by theHarvard Business School. Their approach is sharply focused on the question: Given suchand such a situation, what decision do you make and why? Anyone who has tried to use thisapproach quickly realizes how much effort is needed by the leader to keep the discussion onthe question at hand.During his first year as seminar leader, Reich focused on “resistances.” Freud hadalready stressed the importance of analyzing resistances after he moved beyond hypnosis,and after he found that direct interpretation of the unconscious (as it emerged in deriva-Myron SharafFury On Earth76éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"tives such as dreams) was often not fruitful. He gave up direct interpretation and tried,instead, to make the unconscious conscious by the elimination of the resistances put upagainst the repressed material.Reich directed attention not only to the then familiar forms of resistance thatdirectly impeded the flow of the patient’s associations, such as his or her skipping overthoughts as irrelevant or too embarrassing, going “blank,” being late for sessions, and thelike. He stressed the resistances which, in his opinion, were all the more insidious becausethey did notstop the flow of material. What they did do, Reich was to argue vehemently andin great detail, was to prevent fantasies, memories, and impulses from emerging with strongemotion. Using examples taken from his own treatment failures as well as those of his col-leagues, Reich showed that a great number of analyses, as currently carried out, degenerat-ed into “chaotic situations.” A welter of memories, dreams, and unconscious ideas wasunearthed in helter-skelter fashion, but no strong feelings were released, and the patientshowed little improvement.The first of the resistances on which Reich focused was “latent negative transfer-ence,” not in itself a new concept. Freud had pointed out that the patient transferred hos-tile as well as positive feelings to the analyst, feelings originally directed toward parents andother significant figures in the patient’s childhood.And it was known that both negative andpositive feelings were often concealed. What was new was Reich’s emphasis on negativetransferences and the technical implications he drew from these.Reich noted that analysts tended to focus on the patient’s positive transference andto overlook subtle signs that the patients were angry or afraid of them. As he put it someyears later: “Analysts shied away from bringing out, listening to, confirming or denyingopposing opinions and embarrassing criticism from the patient. In short, one felt personal-ly insecure... .”5Reich also called attention to another, still more pervasive kind of resistance. Henoted that certain characteristic modes of being of the patient—what Reich termed “defen-sive character traits”—could also block the affective impact of analysis. In Reich’s view, suchtraits as rigid politeness,evasiveness, apprehensiveness, and arrogance had originally devel-oped in childhood as a way of warding off strong emotional stimuli from within or without,stimuli once associated with pain,frustration, and guilt. In analysis, they continued to func-tion as a way of blocking strong emotional experiences, now provoked by the unsettlingprocess ofanalysis itself. The defensive character traits, which in their totality Reich termed“character armor,” served to protect the individual against pain, but also served to restrictseverely the capacity for pleasure.It should be emphasized that Reich’s contribution did not lie in the formulation of“character traits” that opposed the process of analysis. For example, Karl Abraham hadnoted that some patients showed “pathological deformities of character” that interferedwith the process of free association, and he had called for the development of a “characteranalysis”to treat these patients6.Reich argued that allpatients had defensive character traits, and that there was no6 : Reich’s Early Work on Character Analysis: 1920-192677éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"sharp distinction between symptom neuroses and character neuroses:The difference between character neuroses and symptom neuroses is simply that inthe latter the neurotic character has produced symptoms as well the neurotic symp-toms are, so to speak, a concentrate of the neurotic character.... The more deeplywe penetrate into its [the symptom’s] determinants, the further we get from thefield of symptomatology proper and the more does the characterological substra-tum come to the fore7.* How did Reich actually deal with defensive character traits in therapy? Here a dis-tinction he made in The Impulsive Characteris significant: namely, that a patient often feels hissymptom (e.g., a tic, a phobia) as alien, but he tends to rationalize a neurotic character traitas an integral part of himself. Some of the analytic task consists of helping the patient tobecome aware of his character defenses and to feel them as painful. Reich stressed that theanalyst does not urge the patient notto be polite or evasive or arrogant. Rather,In ... character analysis, we ask ourself why the patient deceives, talks in a confusedmanner,why he is affect-blocked, etc.; we try to arouse the patient’s interest in hischaracter traits in order to be able, with his help, to explore analytically their originand meaning. All we do is to lift the character trait which presents the cardinalresistance out of the level of the personality and to show the patient, if possible,the superficial connection between character and symptoms; it is left to himwhether or not he will utilize his knowledge for an alteration of his character. ... Weconfront ... the patient with it repeatedly until he begins to look at it objectively andto experience it like a painful symptom; thus, the character trait begins to be expe-rienced as a foreign body which the patient wants to get rid of8.Needless to say,a repeated pointing out of the patient’s defensive character traitsdoes not endear the analyst to the patient. On the contrary, it usually arouses considerableanger.However, the expression of the anger thus aroused helps undo the need for the par-ticular defense. If a patient is rigidly polite in part because he fears to express his anger, theanalyst’s provocation by comments can help the patient learn that the consequences ofanger need not be so terrible; the patient need not hold on to his controlled politeness.Reich also stressed the importance of analyzing character resistances in a logicalorder;that is, to proceed from the more superficial to deeper levels of personality. To con-tinue with the previous example, the defensively polite patient may also be communicatingdreams with clearly incestuous wishes. For Reich it would be a very damaging mistake to dealwith those wishes before first working through the politeness and the rage. Otherwise, theMyron SharafFury On Earth78éditionsles atomes de l’âme* Reich developed these concepts in the 1920s but did not give a detailed presentation of them until he publishedCharakteranalysein 1933."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"infantile sexual longings would be discussed, but not deeply experienced.It is clear from all this that Reich’s approach was quite active. It was not active, how-ever, in the didactic sense of advising or exhorting the patient. Nor was it active in SandorFerenczi’s sense of becoming a direct “good” mother or father surrogate for the patient.The activity lay in the relentless analysis of resistances and in the careful selection of mate-rial from the patient’s communications.Some analysts objected that “resistance analysis”—or “character analysis,” as Reichlater called it, using Abraham’s term—violated the principle that one should let oneself beguided by the patient. Selection ran the danger of permitting one’s personal biases and inter-ests to override the patient’s needs at any given time. Reich replied that the analyst alwaysselected from the patient’s associations, for he did not necessarily interpret a dream insequence but chose this or that detail for interpretation. What really mattered was whetheror not one selected correctly within the analytic situation.A related criticism was that Reich’s approach might artificially exaggerate the resist-ance if the patient’s material did not contain clear-cut signs of defensive character traits.Here Reich, along with others such as Ferenczi and Fenichel, replied that the concept ofmaterial should be enlarged to include not only the content but also the form of the patient’scommunications.Case presentations in the seminar convinced Reich that the nonverbal behav-iorof the patient—his look, facial expression, dress, bodily attitude—was not only underes-timated but often completely overlooked by many analysts.The form of behavior was to assume much importance in Reich’s development oftherapy over the years. By the mid-1930s he was far more interested in the nonverbal emo-tional expression of the patient than in his or her words. However, as early as 1924 or so, hebecame convinced that, in Nietzsche’s words, “one can Me with the mouth, but with theaccompanying grimace one nevertheless tells the truth.” And the nonverbal expression oftencontained the resistive element that had to be dealt with before the words could carry a fullemotional charge. That is, a patient might be relating the most dramatic infantile memories,but in a monotonous, low voice. For Reich, it was important to deal with the blocked emo-tions contained in the vocal expression before getting into the lively content of the commu-nications.I have gone into some technical detail to give an idea of the problems Reichencountered at the time and the analytic context within which they occurred. The underly-ing issues can be summarized in a fairly simple fashion.Reich was trying to understand the conditions under which patients could make useof painful truths, the factors at work in determining when interpretations of the uncon-scious actually helped the patient in his or her total functioning and when analysis became amere mental exercise, or “game.” Analytic truths are painful because the process perforcestirs up old longings, angers, griefs. These emotions, punished or at least not validated inchildhood,are in turn pervaded by anxiety and guilt. Defensive character traits develop as away ofautomatically warding off such feelings. Now the analyst disturbs this “neurotic equi-librium.” Not only because the patient transfers angry and fearful feelings toward him from6 : Reich’s Early Work on Character Analysis: 1920-192679éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"earlier figures but because he threatens the patient’s precarious peace, the patient comes todislike the analyst. True, this peace is unsatisfying, otherwise there would be no need fortherapy. But that does not mean the patient will not “resist” in all kinds of ways the re-expe-riencing of tangled emotions painfully endured during childhood.A way of dealing and at the same time not dealing with this situation is to discussall kinds of things without really feeling them. What Reich did was to begin to focus inten-sively on these “inner reservations.” However they might be expressed, they all served thefunction of preventing one from experiencing the whole truth. To shift images, Reich triedto separate out from the muddied palette of the patient’s feelings the stronger, purer, moreprimary colors.In his stress on strong emotional experience, Reich emphasized an early concept ofFreud’s. When Freud first studied hysterical patients with Josef Breuer in the 1880s, he usedhypnosis. He found that unless a traumatic event was re-experienced, not simply remem-bered, under hypnosis in all its emotional vividness, there was no alleviation of symptoms.Freud came to place less emphasis on the particular issue of remembering withaffect. Yet while Reich returned to this stress on the emotional reexperiencing of infantileevents, he also retained the later Freudian focus on analyzing resistances to the welling upofinfantile memories and feelings.He did not attempt to by-pass the defensive processthrough hypnosis, drugs, and the like.Indeed, in the face of criticism from different analysts during this period, Reichsteadily argued that his own contributions were nothing but a consistent application andextension of Freud’s concepts. Only later was he to claim (in my opinion, correctly) thatfrom the very beginning his approach contained some radical differences from that ofFreud.Some of Reich’s own personality characteristics may have influenced his choosingto emphasize and develop certain lines of Freud’s thought rather than others.One possible connection between Reich’s personality and his theoretical concernswas raised by Richard Sterba,a student of Reich’s in the 1920s and currently a well-knownanalyst in Detroit. Writing some twenty-five years afterward, Sterba acknowledged that “hav-ing lived through the era ofhis [Reich’s] impact on the therapeutic thinking of his time andhaving struggled out of it, I am not altogether in a position to make a completely objectiveappraisal of their significance for present-day analysis.” But he spoke of Reich’s brilliance asa clinician,ofhow impressed he and other students of the technical seminar were, and ofhow the seminar “led to considerable clarification and provided for me the first orientationin the difficult field ofpsychoanalysis.” Sterba criticized, however, what he believed to beReich’s undue emphasis on latent negative transference, an emphasis which he attributed toReich’s “own suspicious character and the belligerent attitude that stems from it.”9There is some truth to this statement, but it is one-sided. In my view, Reich was notinitially inclined to emphasize negative transference. It was clinical experience that impressedupon him the importance of latent negative transference. A case in his Character Analysis, notMyron SharafFury On Earth80éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"published until 1933 but already formulated as a result of his new approach, is worth quot-ing: “Not until a patient who had, in good positive transference, produced a wealth of rec-ollections and yet had failed to get well, told me many months after breaking off the analy-sis that he had never trusted me, did I really know the danger of a negative transferencewhich is allowed to remain latent. This made me, successfully, seek for the means of alwaysgetting the negative transference out of its hiding places.”10The fact that the patient told him of his distrust only many months later may haveallowed Reich, with some distance from the heat of the analysis, to ponder quietly its fullmeaning. Once the significance of latent negative transference did register, it fused withmore personal themes in his own life, giving an extra charge to the shock of recognition.More or less hidden negative feelings had played so crucial a role in his own life: his moth-er’s negative feelings toward his father, which led her to take a lover; Willy’s own hostilitytoward Leon, which led him to wish to conceal the affair; and his jealous rage toward hismother and tutor, which impelled him to hint at the affair to Leon. And if there was ever arole model for somebody digging out the truth from its “hiding places,” it was his fatheronce Willy had fired his suspicions. In periods of stress, Reich himself sometimes unearthedconcealed negative feelings in precisely the belligerent and suspicious way Sterba mentions.But Reich’s emphasis on negative transference was also connected with a more pos-itive aspect of his personality. He liked to make full contact with people. He usually muchpreferred any disagreements to be aired openly rather than remain concealed. As a teacher,for example, he disliked it when students stared off into space or otherwise indicated pre-occupation or boredom with the subject.Reich’s own vitality and emotional directness must have played their part in leadinghim to elicit the same qualities in his patients. Most of those who knew Reich at differentperiods of his life comment first of all on the energy, intensity, and directness of his emo-tional reactions. He in turn welcomed openness on the part of others and experienced unre-sponsiveness as frustrating and painful.Thus,Reich brought to psychoanalysis a disposition to understand and breakthrough the armor he often felt in others. This tendency makes clearer his intense interestin Freudian concepts such as resistance. Put differently, Reich did not proceed entirely with-out preconceptions,as his own writings often make it sound. It in no way minimizes hisachievements to see the personal longings and frustrations that played their role in shapinghis search.Too often the scientific researcher is described in an objective, unemotional waythat overlooks the personal passions, conflicts, yearnings that may also motivate his or herwork.Reich’s emphasis on the form of personal communication and on stratified layersof character structure also relate to his preferred modes of investigation. As I have suggest-ed, Reich always preferred to make matters as concrete as possible. Nonverbal resistances—a contemptuous look, an embarrassed smile, a mumbling voice, a highly controlleddemeanor—are more tangible than a particular memory or fantasy.In Reich’s keen sense for the form of things, one can detect his country back-6 : Reich’s Early Work on Character Analysis: 1920-192681éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"ground and the “peasant” quality about him which so many of his colleagues commentedon, sometimes with admiration, sometimes with disdain. For a farmer, the form and colorof animals, plants, soil, clouds are of practical importance. I was often struck by the simi-larities between the way Reich would look at a patient and the way he would look at an ani-mal or the atmosphere, noting slight shifts in color, sparkle, or movement.One particular concept of Reich’s vividly illustrates his penchant for physical analo-gies: his notion of “character armor,” which formed the basis ofCharacter Analysis.Resistances could now be described in terms of a basic metaphor that allowed for manyvariations on a central theme. Thus, in the case of the compulsive character, “everythingbounces back from his smooth hard surface. The querulous character ... has an armor which,though mobile, is always bristling The passive-feminine character seems soft and yielding,but in the analysis that proves to be a kind of armoring which is very difficult to resolve.”11If in concentrating on resistances, especially in their nonverbal form,Reich wasleading from certain personal strengths, he was also avoiding certain weaknesses. Hisemphasis on resistances to some extent downplayed the importance of working throughinfantile experiences. Put more exactly, Reich argued that only a consistent analysis of resist-ances would bring up early memories in their full affective vividness. However, he was some-what impatient and would grow more so over the years with the slow working through ofchildhood events, the repeated review of infantile fantasies, and the family constellationswithin which they occurred. George Gero quotes Reich as saying in the early 1930s that thepsychological reconstruction of childhood events was not his strong point12. To someextent this may have been connected with his own difficult childhood traumas.Character analysis permits—indeed, demands—considerable activity on the part ofthe analyst. He must make a very careful selection of material: he can be active when thepatient is silent by pointing out the latter’s nonverbal communications. The traditional, morepassive stance of the psychoanalyst was not Reich’s preferred approach. He was much morecomfortable in the role ofvital,active therapist.A possible danger in this approach was noted by Otto Fenichel. In one of the fewcareful criticisms of character analysis, Fenichel states his general agreement with and enthu-siasm for Reich’s concepts. His main caveat concerns not the principles in themselves butthe way they may be applied. He warns against an overly aggressive attack on the armor. Forwe “are familiar with the resistance of some patients, who long for a ‘trauma’ and expectcure not from a difficult analysis, but from the magic effect of a sudden explosion. There isan analogous longing for a trauma on the part of the analyst also. Let us beware of it.”13Fenichel’ s remarks here are extremely sensitive. Certainly nothing in the essence ofcharacter-analytic principles justified harshly aggressive or contemptuous attacks on thepatient’s armor. I would suggest, however, that Reich may have had some need, inside andoutside therapy,to master his own early trauma, which he endured helplessly, by repeatingdramatic, emotioncharged events with himself now in the active, trauma-inducing ratherthan trauma-experiencing role.Frequently the followers of a pioneer take over the possible misuses of hisMyron SharafFury On Earth82éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"approach rather than the virtues, which are always harder to achieve. More recent therapeu-tic approaches, such as the encounter movement, that have been influenced by Reich oftenerr in the direction of sadistic attacks on the armor of patients and of raising false hopesabout the beneficial effects of releasing stormy emotions. They spend less time studying andpracticing character analysis in its true sense: the careful working through of resistances,with precise attention to where the patient is at any given moment.Just as Reich’s personality influenced his psychoanalytic orientation, so the reac-tions to his character-analytic work gave him support for his endeavors and at the same timeintroduced new stresses. The reactions also reveal some destructive organizational process-es within psychoanalysis which Reich encountered as his work became more controversial.Many of the young analysts, like Sterba and Fenichel, welcomed Reich’s contribu-tions. In addition, Sandor Ferenczi, one of Freud’s closest associates and a renownedHungarian analyst in the early 1920s, thought highly of Reich. On his trips to the UnitedStates, he recommended Reich as an analyst to Americans planning to study psychoanalysisin Vienna. As a result, a number of analytic candidates from the United States, includingWalter Briehl, M. Ralph Kaufman, O. Spurgeon English, and John Murray, were analyzed byReich or supervised by him during the 1920s.This kind of recognition must have supported Reich’s feeling that his work was ofvalue and that he was on to something important. At the same time, many of the olderViennese analysts became quite unhappy with Reich’s character-analytic efforts. TheodoreReik, for example, felt that Reich’s “schematic” approach to resistance analysis interferedwith the free play of the analyst’s intuition. The analytic “art” could not be confined to suchrules as “no interpretation of content without first interpreting the resistance.”Other senior analysts reacted by saying that Reich’s proposals were “nothing new”since Freud had already laid down the principle of analyzing resistances. Reich’s reply thatthe principle was not new but the consistent application of it was rare constituted an implic-it indictment of many older analysts’ practice. Reich spoke ominously of the frequency of“chaotic situations”in analysis,of therapy shipwrecked because the analyst made all kindsofdeep interpretations without first dealing with the resistances in the way of the patient’smeaningful use ofsuch insights.Not only the content ofReich’s criticism was provocative but also its form. Tojudge from his own metaphor of himself as a shark in a pond of carps, he did not mincewords in stating his disagreements with others, and indeed at times he may have soundedquite arrogant. In a letter to Paul Federn, dated February 12, 1926, but not in fact sent, hewrote that his active participation in the Society had its drawbacks: at times he was tooaggressive, a trait he regretted, and tried to correct.Reich went on to say that he never intended any personal offense but only said whathe felt to be true without regard “for the age or position of the criticized person.”14It is interesting that Reich brings up the issue of age; at the time he began making6 : Reich’s Early Work on Character Analysis: 1920-192683éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"his criticisms of psychoanalysis he was around twenty-seven, while Federn, Hitschmann,and Nunberg were, respectively, fifty-three, fifty-two, and forty-one. Moreover, these menhad been with Freud for many years, Reich for only a few.Some of Reich’s analytic peers attributed the hostility shown by senior analysts totheir jealousy over the regard that Freud felt for Reich. Freud had permitted Reich to starthis analytic practice while still a medical student. He had steadily supported Reich’s activi-ties, making warm comments about his articles in the early 1920s and encouraging Reich’sefforts in first starting, then leading the technical seminar. One analyst quoted Freud as say-ing that Reich had “the best head” (der beste Kopf) in the Vienna Society15. With our knowl-edge from many sources of Freud’s enormous emotional significance as “father figure” toalmost all his Viennese colleagues and students, we can imagine how galling it must havebeen to older “siblings” to see the young Reich so favored by Freud.The degree of controversy Reich generated among the older analysts can be betterunderstood if we look more closely at the relationship between Reich and the man to whomhe addressed the letter cited above—Paul Federn. Federn had been one of Reich’s main ana-lytic sponsors during the medical school years and his early period as an analyst. Reich hadbeen to his home for dinner and had been his patient for a brief period. And Federn hadcalled Reich the best diagnostician among the younger analysts.Sometime around 1924, Federn’s attitude appears to have changed. In his letter toFedern, Reich complained bitterly that his efforts had met with “blind criticism or scorn”from Federn and other senior analysts. He went on to say that he was upset that he was theonly analyst who discussed his treatment failures in courses and in publications16.In the same letter Reich also complained that he was never appointed to the exec-utive committee of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, though this appointment was prom-ised him and he felt he had earned it through his teaching, writing, and administrative activ-ities. He had not complained, he added, when in 1923 he was rejected for committee mem-bership because it was necessary to have one lay analyst (Siegfried Bernfeld) hold office. Healso accepted Federn’s explanation for the 1924 elections, when a Dr. Robert Jokl was cho-sen rather than Reich for the position of second secretary because certain differences withJokl had to be smoothed over.However, in 1925, one of the two secretariat positions wassimply abolished. Reich interpreted the administrative move as a “boycott of my person anda completely undeserved wrong.”To understand why the appointment was so important to Reich and why headdressed his complaint to Federn, two facts about the Society at that time should bestressed.Freud was now ill with cancer of the jaw. Indeed, he did not believe nor did oth-ers—that he had long to live. (In fact, Freud did not die until September 23, 1939, at the ageof eighty-three.) He had cut down on his activities and no longer attended the regular meet-ings of the Society, although he did meet with the executive committee. And, as Reichacknowledged in his letter to Federn, one reason he wanted to be on the executive commit-tee was that it would provide more of an opportunity to see and listen to “the Professor,” aMyron SharafFury On Earth84éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"motive that was perhaps “infantile, but neither ambitious nor criminal.”Secondly, in 1924 Freud was still chairman of the Society (and the executive com-mittee), but Federn had replaced Otto Rank as vice-chairman. Clearly, the vice-chairmannow had considerable organizational power, particularly if, as in Federn’s case, he had longbeen loyal to Freud.The facts suggest that Reich was not paranoid in thinking that Federn was block-ing his advancement to the executive committee. In 1924, Reich was at first chosen by a voteof the committee as second secretary. But apparently Federn, in a private conversation withFreud, persuaded the latter to go against the committee choice and to appoint Jokl as sec-ond secretary instead.However, close upon the heels of this decision Freud received Reich’s monographon the impulsive character. In a letter dated December 14, Freud wrote Federn:Shortly after you left I read a manuscript by Dr. Reich which he sent me this morn-ing. I found it so full of valuable content that I very much regretted that we hadrenounced the recognition of his endeavors. In this mood it occurred to me thatfor us to propose Dr. Jokl as second secretary is improper because we had no rightto change arbitrarily a decision made by the [Executive] Committee. In the light ofthis fact, what you told me about private animosities against Dr. Reich is not signif-icant. Satisfied with this position, I ask you to abide by the original decision of theExecutive Committee and to drop the substitution of Dr. Jokl. I regret that I haveto contradict myself so quickly but I hope you will agree this is the only correctdecision17.After reading the letter, Federn must have once more communicated with Freud,still urging Jokl over Reich, but now on the grounds that he would be embarrassed vis-à-visJokl. For on December 15, Freud wrote Federn again:I am very sorry that I cannot rescue you from the embarrassment which you havebrought upon yourself. You should have raised your objections against Dr. Reich inthe Committee Meeting,not afterward. To try now to get an affirmative vote fromindividual members [in favor of Jokl] ... with the implication that I am motivatedto torn against Reich is clearly inadmissible. What would you do if a memberrefused such an affirmation [of Jokl]? I can therefore only insist that you representthe decision made by the Committee with your cooperation18.But somehow or other Federn managed to arrange that Jokl, not Reich, wasappointed. Not until 1927 was Reich appointed a member of the executive committee, onthe grounds that he was the leader of the technical seminar, although the same justificationcould have been found as early as 1924. Reich never did hold a formal office within the com-mittee.6 : Reich’s Early Work on Character Analysis: 1920-192685éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"I have gone in some detail into what might be regarded as minor backroom poli-tics in the psychoanalytic movement because it illustrates the growing complexities ofReich’s relationships with his colleagues, especially the senior figures. It also provides furtherevidence of the support Reich received from Freud. Considering the frequent allegations ofReich’s paranoid tendencies, it is worth emphasizing that Reich initially underestimated thedegree to which Federn was working against him.Why was Federn so opposed to Reich? Reich’s character-analytic concepts, hisorganization of the technical seminar, the regard Freud felt for Reich, all help clarify someof the reasons for Federn’s opposition, but do not fully explain it. To anticipate the storybriefly, Federn was also angered by Reich’s emphasis on sexuality. For during the years underdiscussion Reich was also arguing in a series of articles that the capacity for full expressionof genitality, or what he termed “orgastic potency,” was thegoal of psychoanalytic treatment.Furthermore, as Federn undoubtedly knew, Reich, who had married in 1922, washaving extramarital relationships. For his part, Paul Federn has been described by his son,Ernst, as a Victorian an enlightened one, to be sure, but Victorian nonetheless. 19 This out-look (to continue Ernst Federn’s description) was shared by many of the older analysts.While psychoanalysis boldly investigated the details of patients’ sexual lives, fantasies, andearly experiences,Freud’s own views on freer sexual expression versus restraint or sublima-tion were so complex that one could select diverse aspects of his orientation to justify a vari-ety of lifestyles. However, the popular image of the older group of analysts as storming pio-neers or radicals in the way they lived sexually is a myth. For Federn and many others, mar-ital infidelity, like homosexuality, was “immoral.” And to be “moral” was extremely impor-tant.Thus Reich, initially grateful to Federn, had by 1926 become furious with him.Their hostility was to intensify still further Federn being one of the prime movers in Reich’sexpulsion from the psychoanalytic organization in 1934. In the 1940s, when Federn was liv-ing in the United States,he would reply to questions about Reich with a sad “Mea culpa, meamaximaculpa,” referring to the recognition he had given the young medical student and ana-lyst in the days before Reich “went astray.” 20 Perhaps he was also intimating that he haddone a poor job ofanalyzing Reich. On his side, Reich was to reserve some of his choicestepithets for Federn,a man he saw as steadily “digging” against him and undermining hisgood relationship with Freud.If history is the final arbiter of these psychoanalytic conflicts of the 1920s, Freudwas the immediate judge. Freud usually did not express himself on analytic controversiesunless he deemed the divergencies from “classical analysis” important enough (e.g., in thecases ofAdler,Jung,and Rank) to require a firm stand. Yet Reich was notpresenting hischaracter-analytic concepts as a revision of psychoanalysis, but rather as a consistent elabo-ration of cardinal Freudian principles. But the vigor and adamant tone with which he pre-sented his “analysis ofresistances” was sufficient to draw Freud himself into the debate.Freud’s view ofthese quarrels was characteristically complex. In December 1926,ten months after Reich’s angry letter to Federn, Reich gave a talk on his character-analyticMyron SharafFury On Earth86éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"concepts before a small group of analysts at Freud’s home. Reich presented the central prob-lem of whether, in the presence of a latent negative attitude, one should interpret thepatient’s incestuous desires or wait until the patient’s distrust was eliminated. Freud inter-rupted Reich: “Why would you notinterpret the material in the order in which it appears? Ofcourseone has to analyze and interpret incest dreams as soon as they appear.”21Reich relatesthat he kept trying to substantiate his point but could not persuade Freud. It was a specialdisappointment to Reich because in private conversations about technique he had theimpression that Freud supported his approach. Freud’s position at the meeting furtherstrengthened the hand of Reich’s opponents, who “gloated over and pitied” Reich. Finally,Reich was getting into trouble not only with senior analysts but with Freud himself.Freud’s lack of support for character analysis presaged still more severe disagree-ments that were to follow over Reich’s concepts of genitality and orgastic potency.6 : Reich’s Early Work on Character Analysis: 1920-192687éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-1926Reich’s contributions to the study of characterology were crucial to establishing hisreputation. His originality lay in how he expanded and combined existing psychoanalyticideas in the development of a systematic characteranalytic technique.Overlapping in time with his characterological work, Reich published a series ofpapers on orgastic potency that were without precedent in the psychoanalytic literature.Whereas the character-analytic work initially met with considerable approval, Reich’s workon orgastic potency was from the first unpopular. Indeed, he has been ridiculed inside andoutside psychoanalytic circles from the 1920s to the present as the “prophet of the betterorgasm” and the “founder of a genital Utopia.” Yet Reich regarded his elucidation of orgas-tic potency as the keystone to all his later work. “It represented the coastal stretch fromwhich everything else has developed,” he was to write later1.Reich’s path to the study of the function of the orgasm was preceded by a study ofgenitality. Unlike orgastic potency, the concept of genitality had clear connectionswith existing psychoanalytic literature. While Freud had enlarged the concept ofsexuality to include more than genital experience, for example, in his elucidation oforal and anal impulses and fantasies, he had also posited a genital stage in childhoodaround the age of four or five. During this period, masturbation, exhibitionism, andgenital feelings toward the parent of the opposite sex began to develop. In addi-tion,Karl Abraham had formulated the concept of a “genital character” to describethe kind ofperson who had successfully resolved the Oedipal conflicts character-istic of this stage.Freud clearly saw genital union between man and woman as the “normal” adultexpression ofthe sexual instinct. He paid attention to a wide variety of “deviations” fromthis norm, whether expressed as object choice (e.g., homosexuality) or in the kind of pre-ferred sexual activity (e.g., voyeurism).For all his stress on “deviation” from “normal” sexuality, Freud did not provide anyclear guidelines as to what constituted healthy adult genital functioning. Psychoanalysiscould explain and sometimes treat gross genital disturbances such as impotence, extremefrigidity, and perversion. If no such clear-cut disturbances existed, if the male was erective-ly and ejaculatively potent, if the female experienced a predominance of vaginal over clitoralexcitation,* then psychoanalysts by and large were prepared to accept the patient’s sexualMyron SharafFury On Earth88éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"functioning as “normal.” True, there might still be various psychological conflicts disturbingthe individual’s love relations. But the physiologicalsexual functioning itself need not be inquestion.It was into this undefined area of healthy adult genitality that the young Reichchose to move both clinically and theoretically. True to the psychoanalytic tradition of study-ing pathology, he confined himself at first to a more detailed exposition of genital conflicts.Thus in his first paper on the genital experiences of patients, “Uber Spezifitat derOnanieformen” (“The Specificity of Forms of Masturbation”), written in 1922, when Reichwas twenty-five, he noted that “in not a single patient was the act of masturbation accom-panied by the fantasy of experiencing pleasure in the sexual act.”2Reich also noted that the masturbation fantasies of his male patients could bedivided into two major groups: in the first group, the penis functioned, it was erect andactive, but it was conceived as a murderous weapon or as a way of “proving” potency. In thesecond, the penis remained flaccid and there were masochistic fantasies of being beaten,bound, or tortured.Reich’s approach to the study of his patients’ masturbation is noteworthy. First, hewas clearly not satisfied with the simple report from the patient that “I masturbated.” Hewanted to know, in detail,howand with what kindof fantasy. He also assumed that healthymasturbation included the fantasy of heterosexual intercourse, an assumption that—to myknowledge—was not previously present in the psychoanalytic literature. Finally, he was con-cerned with how closely masturbation had a genital orientation, not only in fantasy but alsoin physiological functioning (e.g., in the male, erection and thrusting motions).The following year, 1923, Reich published the first outline of what was to becomehis major thesis concerning genitality. The article, “Uber Genitalitat” (“On Genitaiity”),dealt with the prognostic significance of the patient’s having attained “genital primacy” inchildhood3.Reich also contended that an evaluation ofthe patient’s genital functioningduring analysis provided an important, if not the most important, therapeutic criterion.On the importance of “genital primacy,” Reich argued that patients who hadreached the genital stage in childhood had a better prognosis than those who, having reachedit,later regressed to an earlier mode of psychosexual functioning. The latter in turn had abetter prognosis than those who as children had never reached the genital stage but hadremained fixated at the oral or anal level.Had Reich confined himself to these observations, backed by case material, hewould have made a valuable but modest contribution to the psychoanalytic literature. Thecrux of these findings on psychosexual development was not original with him. However,Reich then went on to make statements that were both original and highly controversial.7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-192689éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Psychoanalytic theory posited a shift in normal female development from an active, predominantly clitoral exci-tation in childhood to a more receptive, vaginal orientation in adolescence and adulthood. This notion, which hascome under critical fire in recent years, will be examined in more detail later."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"He argued that allpatients were genitally disturbed: that is, they did not achieve fullsatisfaction in sexual intercourse. Reich’s discussion of incomplete sexual gratification hadexplicit connections with some of Freud’s early formulations. In 1905, Freud had remarkedthat “no neurosis is possible with a normal vita sexualis.”4The classical psychoneurosesstudied by Freud hysteria and obsessional neuroses were rooted in infantile sexual conflicts.Freud posited another set of neuroses, and applied the term “actual neuroses” tothose that resulted from present-day (aktuellein German) disturbances of adult sexual life.Thus, the two forms of “actual neuroses” anxiety neurosis and neurasthenia were distur-bances that were the immediate result of damned-up sexuality. Anxiety neurosis was causedby sexual abstinence or coitus interruptus. It had to be distinguished from neurasthenia,which was caused by “sexual abuse,” such as “excessive masturbation,” and characterized byback pains, headaches, inability to concentrate, and feelings of fatigue.Actual neuroses, unlike the psychoneuroses, were not amenable to classical analyt-ic treatment. They were treated by eliminating the harmful sexual practices that led to the“damming up” of sexual energy. However, exactly why a patient engaged in such harmfulsexual practices in the first place was not clear in Freud’s formulation.If Freud distinguished clearly between psychoneuroses and actual neuroses, Reichcame to believe in a strong relationship between the two sets of neuroses. He argued thatwithout some kind of psychic inhibition, there would be no “actual neuroses,” for why elsewould a person abstain from or abuse sex? (Later, Reich would also emphasize social factorssuch as the unavailability of contraceptives that could contribute to the development ofactual neuroses.) At the same time, Reich argued that the actual neuroses provided the driv-ing energetic core of the psychoneuroses. “Where did they (the compulsions and hysterias)derive their energy from? Undoubtedly, from the actual neurotic core of the dammed-upsexual energy.”5In the relationship between actual neuroses and psychoneuroses, Reich detected areciprocal interaction,the kind ofinteraction he was later to emphasize in diverse realms.He saw the reactivated infantile conflicts, in the form of a psychoneurosis, as further imped-ing adult genital function, thereby intensifying the actual neuroses, and so on in an endlessvicious circle.However, there was also the possibility of a beneficent circle. A fulfilled sex-ual life with no actual neurosis could lead to a withdrawal of energy from early childhoodconflicts. The reduction in infantile inhibitions in turn facilitated ever more gratifying adultlove relations. Indeed, in his first article on genitality, Reich claimed that this was happeningin his successful cases. He argued that those patients who improved were able, with helpfrom analysis,to maintain the kind of love life that drained off energy from the infantileconflicts. The unconsciousmaterial was not so much worked through in detail as it wasdeprived of the “water” that had previously stimulated its malignant growth.We can note here two parallel lines, the convergence of which Reich did not initial-ly emphasize. In the technical seminar, Reich was concerned with describing the conditionsunder which the interpretation of repressed material was effective. It was important for thepatient to remember with affect by means of the systematic analysis of resistances. Initially,Myron SharafFury On Earth90éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"however, in the technical seminar Reich did not place great emphasis on the genital func-tioning of patients. By contrast, in his first papers on genitality, he emphasized the deleteri-ous consequences of blocked libidinal discharge, but did not deal with the analysis of resist-ances. In both contexts, Reich was concerned with the liberation of emotion. In one setting,he was focusing on the characterological obstacles to liberation. In the other, he was stress-ing the emotional—or more specifically the genital—wave of excitation and its discharge.In the interrelation between actual neuroses and psychoneuroses, Reich believed hehad found some way of short-cutting the long, involved process of resistance analysis hehad elaborated in the technical seminar. This particular direction would lead him later intovery active social efforts, counseling of the young, birth control clinics, and mass meetingsdealing with the connections between politics and sexual suppression. But in the early 1920s,this particular angle of his work had not yet crystalized. What we see during this period ishis movement in two theoretical directions: through character analysis into an ever deeperelucidation ofinnerobstacles to psychological health; and through his development of theconcept of actual neuroses into an emphasis on more superficial conflicts and reality frus-trations, the elimination of which might reverse the neurotic process.Over the years, Freud himself paid less and less attention to actual neuroses,although he never abandoned this separate category of emotional illness, while most otheranalysts had little use for it. Among major analytic theorists, Reich alone maintained a stronginterest in actual neuroses and the related concept of anxiety as transformed sexuality. In astudy generally critical of Reich, Charles Rycroft has commented:[Reich’s] view of the relationship between actual and psychoneuroses has not beenabsorbed into psychoanalytic thinking but it has two great merits. It retains a con-nection between psychopathology and physiology in the last resort the neuroses arenot purely mental formations but arise from and affect the body and it provides anexplanation ofwhy neuroses do not disappear spontaneously. So far as I knowReich is the only analyst to offer any sort of explanation as to why the childhoodpathogenic experiences that according to psychoanalysis cause neuroses do notgradually lose their impact when neurotics move away from their childhood envi-ronment6.What Reich did not do in this first paper on genitality was to define what in fact hemeant by effectivegenital satisfaction. He still accepted the prevailing psychoanalytic defini-tions—erective and ejaculative potency in men, a vaginal orgasm in women. Reich’s scantydescription ofgenital health left him open to criticism that was quick in coming. He himselfdescribed the reception to his first paper on genitality, which he presented at a meeting ofthe Vienna Psychoanalytic Association in November 1923, as follows:While I was talking,I became increasingly aware of a chilling of the atmosphere. Iused to speak well, and thus far had always found my audience attentive. When I7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-192691éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"was finished, there was an icy stillness in the room. After a pause, the discussionbegan. My assertion that the genital disturbance was perhaps the most importantsymptom of the neurosis, was erroneous. Even worse ... was my contention that anevaluation of genitality provided prognostic and therapeutic criteria. Two analystsbluntly asserted that they knew any number of female patients with a completelyhealthy sex life. They seemed to me more excited than their usual scientific reservewould have led one to expect.In this controversy I started out by being at a disadvantage. I had had to admit tomyself that among the male patients there were many with an apparently undis-turbed genitality, though the case was not true of the female patients7.It is interesting that Reich later acknowledged having to “admit to myself” in 1923that there were male patients who appeared genitally healthy in spite of neurotic symptoms.The paper itself holds no hint of such an awareness. Characteristically, Reich expressed him-self at the time as more certain than in fact he was.The criticisms Reich encountered sent him back to the drawing board, intent ondefining more precisely what he meant by a satisfactory genital life, and the ways his neurot-ic patients failed to show this kind of gratification. This seems to be the first of manyinstances where Reich fruitfully used opposition to his work in a creative way to define morecarefully what he meant: that, in this instance, there were genitally well-functioning patientswho nonetheless suffered from neurotic symptoms. Stimulated to further study, he woulddemonstrate that he was more right than his critics thought, though in a different way fromthe one originally argued.In addition to the details of his own patients’ sexual functioning, Reich proceededto examine, through interviews and case records, the love life of over two hundred patientsseen at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Polyclinic. He was testing several hypotheses here:(1) That genital disturbance was present in all neuroses;(2) That the severity of neuroses was positively correlated with the degree of genital disturbance; and (3) That patients who improved in therapy and remained symptom-free achieved agratifying sex life.Again, Reich was impressed by the frequency and depth of genital disturbances hefound. He became very suspicious of the superficial reports about sexual experience,whether supplied by clinic patients themselves or by the psychiatrists who evaluated them.For example, a patient whose sex life was reported to be normal, on closer interviewing byReich revealed that she experienced pleasurable sensations during intercourse but no climax.Moreover, she was consumed by thoughts of murdering her partner following the act.Reich’s research efforts were a far cry from current standards, though for psycho-analysts in the 1920s they were better than most. In this instance he at least studied moreMyron SharafFury On Earth92éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"than a few cases before giving his conclusions. Ideally, however, one would like to have hadmuch more specific definitions of what Reich meant by freedom from symptoms in non-sexual areas.Reich’s second paper directly concerned with genitality, published in 1924, “Dietherapeutische Bedeutung des Genitallibidos” (“The Therapeutic Significance of GenitalLibido”), is significant because in it he first noted that while some patients were potent inthe usual sense of the term, they lacked what he called “orgastic potency.” Orgastic poten-cy included, among other attributes, the fusion of tender and sensuous strivings towardone’s partner, rhythmic frictional movements during intercourse, a slight lapse of conscious-ness at the acme of sexual excitation, “vibrations of the total musculature” during the dis-charge phase, and feelings of gratified fatigue following intercourse8.Reich was not unique in his emphasis on the capacity for uniting tender and sensu-ous feelings in a healthy love relationship. As early as 1912, Freud had noted that many malepatients would not unite both tender and sensuous feelings, but would concentrate the for-mer on an idealized mother figure toward whom they could not feel erotic, and their sexualfeelings on prostitutes9. What was original was Reich’s emphasis on the involuntary physi-cal aspects of full genital discharge.In his next paper, “Die Rolle der Genitalitat in der Neurosentherapie” (“The Roleof Genitality in the Therapy of the Neuroses”), published in 1925, Reich expanded on the“involuntary surrender” and the total bodily involvement of healthy genitality. He alsoargued that adequate discharge of sexual energy can only come about through the genitals:“The pregenital erogenous zones ... can only serve to increase the level of excitation.”10It became clear that the patients Reich and others had previously regarded as sex-ually normal failed to meet these more refined requirements.On the psychological level,Reich noted that seemingly potent male patients who could not completely surrender dur-ing intercourse also used very active heterosexual strivings as a defense against other (e.g.,homosexual) impulses.Earlier psychoanalytic literature had documented the variety of motives and wish-es at work in love relationships. But they also posited that a patient’s sexual act itself couldbe “normal”in the physiological sense even if his relations with his partners were chaoticor otherwise highly disturbed. What was new in Reich’s formulation was that the physical actwas disrupted when unconscious conflicts were operative.I have tried to show how Reich’s concept of orgastic potency did not emerge sud-denly and in full-blown form. On the contrary, since it was intimately related to his clinicaland theoretical concerns, it took time to coalesce. Indeed, not until 1926 could Reich pres-ent a highly detailed description of what in fact he meant by “orgastic potency.” It was con-tained in his book Die Funktion des Orgasmus,written in 1926 and published in 1927.By this time,Reich’s grip on the subject had increased to the point where he couldoffer a description that, essentially, would satisfy him to the end of his life. When in 1942Reich published another volume, also entitled The Function ofthe Orgasm,he took almostunchanged the elucidation oforgastic potency from the 1927 German volume, whereas the7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-192693éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"rest of the later work was radically different11.Because of its pivotal significance, I shall present Reich’s description of orgasticpotency in considerable detail, quoting parts of it.Conceptually, Reich divided the orgastically satisfying sexual experience into twomain phases: the voluntary control of the excitation, and the involuntary contractions.In the first phase, for the man, erection is pleasurable and the genital not overex-cited. An important criterion of orgastic potency in the male is the urge to penetrate, an urgenot found in many erectively potent men with narcissistic characters. The man is also spon-taneously gentle, without having to cover up sadistic impulses by a forced kind of tender-ness. The genital of the woman becomes hyperemic and moist. Reich also asserts that the“activity of the woman normally differs in no way from that of the man. The widely preva-lent passivity of the woman is pathological... .”Reich goes on to describe a rise in excitation in both the man and the woman fol-lowing penetration of the penis. “The man’s sensation of ‘being sucked in’ corresponds tothe woman’s sensation that she is ‘sucking the penis in.’” As a result of mutual, slow, andspontaneous effortless frictions the excitation is concentrated on the surface and glans ofthe penis, and the posterior parts of the vaginal mucous membrane. Reich’s emphasis on slowand spontaneousfrictional movements in contrast to rapid, forced ones provided yet anotherkey distinguishing mark of orgastic potency: “According to the consensus of potent menand women, the pleasure sensations are all the more intense the slower and more gentle thefrictions are, and the better they harmonize with each other. This presupposes a consider-able ability to identify oneself with one’s partner.”With continued friction, the excitation spreads more and more to the whole body,while the excitation of the genital remains more or less at the same level. Finally, as a resultof another, usually sudden increase of genital excitation, there sets in the second phase.In this second phase, the increase of excitation can no longer be controlled volun-tarily; rather, it takes hold of the whole physical being and produces rapid heartbeat anddeep expirations.Bodily excitation becomes concentrated more upon the genital, a “melting” sensa-tion sets in, which may best be described as a radiation of excitation from the genital toother parts ofthe body.This excitation results first in involuntary contractions—similar to waves—in thetotal musculature ofthe genital and of the pelvic floor. In this stage, interruption of the sex-ual act is absolutely unpleasurable, for both man and woman; instead of occurring rhythmi-cally, the muscular contractions, which lead to the orgasm as well as to the ejaculation, wouldoccur in the form ofspasms. This results in intensely unpleasant sensations and occasion-ally leads to pain in the pelvic floor and the lower back; in addition, as a result of the spasm,ejaculation occurs earlier than in the case of an undisturbed rhythm.With an increase in the frequency of the involuntary muscular contractions, theexcitation increases rapidly and steeply up to the acme. Now occurs a more or less intenseclouding of consciousness. The frictions become spontaneously more intensive, after having sub-Myron SharafFury On Earth94éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"sided momentarily at the point of the acme; the urge to “penetrate completely” increaseswith each ejaculatory muscle contraction. In the woman, the muscle contractions take thesame course as in the man. Experientially, the difference is only that during and immediate-ly after the acme the healthy womans wants to “receive completely.”The orgastic excitation takes hold of the entire body and results in lively contractionsof the whole body musculature. Self-observations of healthy individuals of both sexes show thatwhat is called the release of tension is predominantly the result of a flowing back of the excita-tion from the genital to the body. This flowing back is experienced as a sudden decreaseof the ten-sion. The complete flowing back of the excitation toward the whole body is what consti-tutes gratification. Gratification means two things: shift of the direction of flow of excitationin the body, and unburdening of the genital apparatus.Then the excitation tapers off and is immediately replaced by a pleasant bodily andpsychic relaxation; usually, there is a strong desire for sleep. The sensual relations have sub-sided. What continues is a grateful, tender attitude toward the partner.Reich contrasts this kind of sensation with those found in the orgastically impo-tent: leaden exhaustion, disgust, repulsion, or indifference, and occasionally hatred towardthe partner. In other instances, such as satyriasis and nymphomania, the sexual excitationdoes not subside.Often in these instances insomnia and restlessness follow.In reviewing orgastic potency, Reich sounded his dominant chords:The involuntary contractions of the organism and the complete discharge of the excitationare themost important criteria of orgastic potency... . There are partial releases of tensionwhich are similarto an orgasm; they used to be taken for the actual release of ten-sion. Clinical experience shows that man—as a result of general sexual repres-sion—has lost the capacity for ultimate vegetatively involuntary surrender. What I meanby “orgastic potency” is exactly this ultimate, hitherto unrecognized portion of thecapacity for excitation and release of tension.It has often been said ofReich that he emphasizes orgastic potency, but does notspeak oflove. In fact, he is quite aware of the psychological aspects of the experience:...In both sexes, the orgasm is more intense if the peaks of genital excitation coin-cide. This occurs frequently in individuals who are able to concentrate their tenderas well as their sensual feelings on a partner; it is the rule when the relationship isundisturbed by either internal or external factors. In such cases, at least consciousfantasies are completely absent;the ego is undividedly absorbed in the perceptionofpleasure.The ability to concentrate oneselfwith one’s whole personality on the orgastic expe-rience, in spite of possible conflicts, is a further criterion of orgastic potency.With Reich’s description oforgastic potency we enter the specific Reichian domain.The very silence of this world—a world of slow, frictional movement, of lapse of con-7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-192695éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"sciousness, of involuntary contractions—sets it apart from the usual analytic concern withverbalization and cognitive mastery of the emotive and irrational. Indeed, there is irony inthe fact that Reich chooses as his criterion of mental health the individual’s capacity to gobeyond mental phenomena, to have no thought, no consciousness even, but to surrendercompletely to the involuntary and to sensations of pleasure.In this emphasis on the wordless, the ineffable, Reich revealed himself as closer tothe truths of certain philosophers and poets than to his fellow psychoanalysts. Nietzschehad written: “All the regulations of mankind are tuned to the end that the intense sensationof life is lost in continual distractions.”12Wittgenstein asserted that the most importantmatters of life were essentially not discussable; they were beyond words. And Conrad Aikenhas described how most of us reveal only little glimpses of our lives:... All the while Withholding what’s most precious to ourselves,— Some sinister depth of lust or fear or hatred,The somber note that gives the chord its power;Or a white loveliness—if such we know— Too much like fire to speak of without shame13.Reich’s emphasis on the involuntary and nonverbal in orgastic experience laterearned him the criticism that he was anti-intellectual, a celebrater of the Lawrentian “pullingof the blood” at the expense of the ego, or of man’s cognitive mode of functioning. Thecharge is unwarranted. Reich was in no way opposed to clear, rational thinking.CharacterAnalysis, for example, represents a very high order of sustained, original, intricate conceptu-alization. Indeed, Reich argued that nothing interfered with productive thinking more than“sexual stasis,” since with it often went a nagging preoccupation with sexual fantasies and aheavy investment ofenergy in quelling the inner turmoil.Reich’s claims for the importance of orgastic potency left him open to more spe-cific criticisms than the accusation of romanticism. The charge has been made that Reich’sevidence for his claims was slim.But as Charles Rycroft has commented: “Whereas the typ-ical civilized man with his inhibiting character armor only experiences partial releases of ten-sion which are similar to orgasm, the genital character experiences an ultimate vegetativelyinvoluntary surrender of which lesser mortals have no inkling... . One is ... left wonderinghow Reich knew, from what experiences of his own or his patients he derived thisinsight.”14Since an important source for Reich’s concept of orgastic experience was in fact hisown life, let us turn again to the relationship between his ideas and his personality in privatelife.It is clear from the vicissitudes of Reich’s relationships with women that his sex lifevaried considerably. When he was nineteen years old, Reich for the first time experienced“orgastic potency”in his relationship with an Italian woman. This was different from hisMyron SharafFury On Earth96éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"previous sexual affairs; it was also different from many of his subsequent relationships. Forexample, in his disguised case history, Reich wrote of a period during medical school whenhe “experienced a restless quest for an ideal sexual partner, with feelings of disappointmentfollowing any actual experience.”In the next chapter, we shall see how his marriage deteriorated in the mid-1920s,leading him to resume his relationship with Lia Laszky on a fuller basis than when they weremedical students. Throughout his life, Reich was acutely aware of the inner and outer obsta-cles in his own sexual relations. Psychological and physical compatibility, the degree of trust,social conditions, outbreaks of jealousy—all these could and did affect his sexual experience.Many factors were at work, it is clear, in Reich’s formulation of and emphasis onorgastic potency. They included his personal problems in the usual sense; the wide range inhis functioning, which posed a challenge for him to understand; and the opposition to hisown intense feelings.The same combination of factors emerges if we turn to the earlier determinants ofReich’s interest in genitality. His lateremphasis allowed his family tragedy to been seen in anew light. In his first paper, Reich had focused on the disruptive aspects of his mother’saffair on his own psychic development. A few years later, he was able to look at his moth-er’s actions from her point ofview.Although his social criticism was still not highly devel-oped in the early 1920s, he did comment on the “plight of the unhappily married womanwho is economically chained to her husband under irreconcilable, desolate circum-stances.”15No longer is his mother’s affair with the tutor to be denounced.The concept of orgastic potency provided Reich with a solution to a general prob-lem as well as to some of his own specific concerns. If genitality had been understood andaffirmed, his mother need not have died, his own development would have been less rivenby conflict, and his strengths might have received a more nourishing response from theworld.Related concepts that Reich emphasized also seem to have been connected with hisown experiences,for example, the notion of “actual neuroses” or “stasis neuroses.” Reichhimself,especially as a young man, may have suffered a good many somatic symptoms underconditions of sexual abstinence. He once told Richard Sterba that he experienced sharp feel-ings ofphysical discomfort when deprived of sexual intercourse for any length of time16.During medical school his relationship with Lia, which stopped short of intercourse, maywell have led to actual-neurotic symptoms.Reich’s discomfort with abstinence could also have been related to his distaste forthe concept ofsublimation. In his early papers on genitality, Reich maintained, in contrastto Freud and most analysts, that the capacity for sublimation was insufficient as a criterionfor therapeutic cure. “Clinical experience [shows] that the psyche cannot discharge the totallibidinous excitation in the form of work for any length of time.” Reich went on to say thatthe majority of patients were not scholars or artists whose work could, at least for limitedperiods oftime,absorb enormous amounts of energy. “They needed direct and effectivegenital gratification.”177 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-192697éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Reich was right, I believe, in his assertion that the best basis for solid, pleasurablework was a fulfilled love life. However, I also believe that he underestimated the capacity ofmany people to use work as an effective way of binding sexual energy in the absence ofdirect genital gratification. His adamant position on this issue stemmed in part from the factthat work, in the absence of love, was difficult for him.Reich’s sexual concepts also related to his preferred mode of investigation. Reichwas fascinated by the concrete and the tangible. The phenomena described by Freud in con-nection with actual neuroses, such as anxiety attacks, palpitations, and the like, had a directphysiological quality that greatly appealed to him. As he put it some years later: “It is notsurprising that [Freud’s] theory of the actual neuroses, struck me as more in keeping withnatural science than the ‘interpretation’ of the meaning of ‘symptoms’ in the psychoneu-roses.”18Again and again, Reich picks up on early Freudian notions that strike some specialresonance in him. Drawn to Freud’s early work on “catharsis,” he made it a central part ofhis character-analytic endeavors. He was drawn also to actual neuroses, which, in the formof stasis neuroses, were to become linchpins in his theory building and clinical work.It is interesting that the concept of “sexual stasis,” like the concept of resistance,facilitated a very direct clinical approach. In analytic sessions, Reich could note the rapidalternation between feelings of anxiety and genital excitation:It happens frequently that a patient becomes excited during the analytic therapy ses-sion because of unconscious sexual fantasies regarding the transference situation.If the sexual repression has not as yet been dissolved, one finds that they complainabout fatigue, weakness, faintness of the extremities, feelings of heat or cold, pal-pitations of the heart, anxiety, etc. The symptoms of anxiety disappear and genitalpleasure sensations appear in their place, if one succeeds in liberating the patient’sgenital sensations, after the repressed fantasies have been made conscious. ... It isan analytic triumph ifthe therapy succeeds in helping the patient to stop repress-ing the perception ofthe newly emerging sexual excitement which causes power-ful,growing sexual feelings which often are extremely hard to tolerate19.Reich was unusual, if not unique, among analysts in working so directly with thepatient’s genital sensations. Undoubtedly, the directness of his therapeutic approach (evenbefore he moved to touching the patient’s body) strengthened the conviction of some olderanalysts that Reich was an “immoral” therapist as well as an “immoral” man.Indeed, Reich’s penchant for the concrete, the physical, the tangible is no more evi-dent than in his description of orgastic potency. Reich, of course, did not directly see orgas-tic potency in his patients. He had to rely on verbal reports from his patients of their ownsex lives. However, during analysis he made a point of eliciting and observing bodily phe-nomena that were close to the experience of “real-life” sexuality.Which brings us back to the original question: On what evidence did Reich base hisMyron SharafFury On Earth98éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"concepts concerning orgastic potency? I have made clear my belief that Reich started fromhis own sexual experiences. He then went on to find corroborating and amplifying evidencefrom his clinical work and from general social-cultural observations. Gradually, he wove aninterlocking network of evidence to support his sweeping hypotheses.Freud utilized the same procedure when, on the basis of his own selfanalysis, lim-ited clinical experience, and wide reading in anthropology and literature, he proclaimed theuniversality of the Oedipus complex. That this complex was not as universal as he assumeddoes not detract from the magnificence of the discovery. Nor do the possible qualificationsregarding Reich’s concept of orgastic potency substantially detract from its magnificence.Even though the evidence for the degree of correctness of Reich’s sexual concepts is farfrom conclusive, orgastic potency remains an immensely fruitful concept.It takes an unusual kind of mind, an unusual courage, indeed, an unusual narcis-sism, to say: What is true of me is true of all men. Emerson once wrote: “In great writerswe meet our own rejected thoughts.” This kind of approach can lead to huge errors, ifuncontrolled by objective research. But it can also be the path to great discoveries.Throughout his life, an important ingredient of Reich’s work method was to begin with feel-ing, with subjective experience, and then move on to more controlled observation. I haveemphasized here his commitment to the first part ofthis method,a commitment that dis-tinguishes him from most contemporary scientists.Reich was criticized for the content of his concepts, but equally for his manner ofpresenting them. For example, Helena Deutsch, looking back to the 1920s, speaks with dis-taste of Reich’s “aggressiveness” and “fanaticism” in advancing his ideas on sexuality20.A closer look at Reich’s presentation of his views on genitality yields a more com-plex picture. If there is a note of fanaticism in the early papers on genitality, Reich was alsocapable of going back to clinical issues and reviewing them more carefully in response tocriticism. Furthermore, there was a tentativeness that revealed itself less in his manner ofpresentation than in the absence ofany presentation at all. In the technical seminar, forinstance,Reich wrote that “the actual goal of therapy, that of making the patient capable oforgasm, was not mentioned in the first years of the seminar. I avoided the subject instinc-tively. It was not liked and aroused animosity. Furthermore, I was not too sure about itmyself.”21In certain instances the opposition clearly stung Reich, perhaps even inspired him,to pursue his efforts all the more vigorously, to state his conclusions all the more sweeping-ly.But he could also complain about specific ill treatment. For example, in the unsent letterto Paul Federn of February 12, 1926, Reich spoke of the “irrelevant personal criticism”Theodore Reik had made of one of his papers. He also mentioned the “personal insults ofDrs. Hitschmann, Nunberg, and Hoifer.” He went on to write that he would not even item-ize all the instances of “needling” lest he appear foolish22.Reich was perhaps needled for other aspects of his work besides his formulationson genitality,although these seem to have been the main target. And he appears to have been7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-192699éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"especially sensitive to any allusion that he advocated promiscuity or lived a promiscuous life.An anecdote from around 1920 illustrates this sensitivity.During his medical school days, Lia Laszky and Reich attended a party given byPaul and Gisela Stein. Paul, it seems, had a sarcastic wit and was not hesitant to use it evenagainst friends. At the party, a game was played, a kind of charade, in which one personwould leave the room and an object would be selected to represent the missing person. Theperson then returned, and he or she would have to determine why the particular represen-tation was chosen. When Lia, who was Reich’s girlfriend at the time, left the room, Paulchose a fruit bowl to represent her23.The point of Stein’s little joke lies in the double meaning of the word “fruit” inGerman, its second, slang meaning being “sexual philanderer.” Lia was the “bowl” in whomthe “fruit” Reich lay. Reich did not get the joke at first, but when he did, he was furious—so furious he almost left the party. Laszky commented ironically that he wasn’t angrybecause their relationship had been joked about in so public a fashion. He was angry becausehe had been called a philanderer. Perhaps his chagrin was all the greater because, in fact, his“philandering” with Laszky was quite limited at that time.Whatever Reich’s sensitivities to the criticism from his analytic peers, they were asnothing compared with his concern over Freud’s reactions. For Reich kept arguing that justas his character-analytic concepts were the “logical” extension of Freud’s resistance analysis,so his concept of orgastic potency was the “logical” amplification of Freud’s emphasis onfreeing libido from its pregenital fixations.It mattered a great deal to Reich that Freud should endorse the legitimacy of thisview. Reich felt a strong sense of loyalty to Freud and certainly a strong desire for hisapproval. Given the attacks from older analysts, Reich’s concepts would have been utterlyintolerable if he had not linked them so closely with Freud’s.Freud’s initial reaction to Reich’s work in the sphere of sexuality was positive. Inreply to the 1925 paper Reich wrote on “actual neuroses,” Freud commented in a letter tohim:I have known for a long time that my formulation ofAktualneurosenwas superfi-cial and in need of thorough-going correction... . Clarification was to be expected from fur-ther,intelligent investigation. Your efforts seem to point a new and helpful way. Whetheryour assumption really solves the problem I do not know. I still have certain doubtsHowever, I trust you will keep the problem in mind and will arrive at a satisfactory solu-tion24.Given this encouraging response, Reich was quite upset when Freud responded lesswarmly to a more systematic presentation of Reich’s views on actual neuroses and the func-tion of the orgasm. This elucidation occurred in his book Die Funktion des Orgasmus, whichReich presented in manuscript form to Freud on the occasion of the latter’s seventieth birth-day on May 6, 1926. The manuscript was dedicated: “To my teacher, Professor SigmundFreud,with deep veneration.” When Freud saw it, he hesitated a moment, then said, as ifdisturbed, “That thick?” Reich felt uneasy and thought that Freud would not have made suchMyron SharafFury On Earth100éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"a cutting remark without a basis25.Worse still, Freud took more than two months to respond to the manuscript,whereas his usual habit was to give a written opinion within a few days. When he didrespond, Freud wrote:Dear Dr. Reich:I took plenty of time, but finally I did read the manuscript which you dedicated to me for my anniversary. I find the book valuable, rich in observation and thought. As you know, I am in no way opposed to your attempt to solve the problem of neurasthenia by explaining it on the basis of the absence of genital primacy26.Why Reich read this letter as a rejection is not clear since, on the surface, it doesnot seem so. Perhaps it was its brevity. Probably Reich was also reacting to the wholesequence of events. At any rate, Freud’s reaction was sufficient for Reich to postpone send-ing the book to the publisher until January 1927.Exactly what Freud thought about Reich’s orgasm theory is not clear on the basisof evidence from those years. However, there are documented reactions from a slightly laterdate that give some clues to what may have been in Freud’s mind when he responded to themanuscript ofDie Funktion des Orgasmus.In a letter dated May 9, 1928, to Lou Andreas-Salome, friend of Nietzsche, Rilke,and Freud, and a practicing psychoanalyst in the later years of her life, Freud wrote: “Wehave here a Dr. Reich, a worthy but impetuous young man, passionately devoted to hishobby horse, who now salutes in the genital orgasm the antidote to every neurosis. Perhapshe might learn from your analysis of K. to feel some respect for the complicated nature ofthe psyche.”27Freud was responding to a description by Andreas-Salome of a woman (K.) whosuffered from hysteria “with the typical father tie” but who nonetheless had sexual experi-ences that revealed a “capacity for enjoyment, a spontaneity and an inner psychical surren-der such as in this combination of happiness and seriousness is not often to be met with.”28It is clear from Freud’s response that he shared the attitude of many analysts that there aresexually healthy neurotics.Freud’s emphasis on pregenital factors in the development of neuroses was madeeven more explicit at an evening meeting held in his home in 1928 or 1929. When Reich pre-sented his views on orgastic potency, Freud replied that “complete orgasm” was not theanswer. There were still pregenital drives that could not be satisfied even with orgasm.“There is no single cause for the neuroses” was his verdict29.Thus, Reich was probably correct in sensing some coldness in Freud’s response tohis manuscript. The growing divergence between the two men abounds in ironies. WhileFreud certainly stressed pregenital factors, initially he had also been impressed by genitalones in the development of the neuroses. In 1914, he wrote about the “bad reception7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-1926101éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"accorded even among intimate friends to my contention of a sexual etiology in the neu-roses.”30However, he then recalled earlier conversations with the analysts Breuer, Charcot,and Chrobak. Each had related rather casually anecdotes involving the sexual—in the senseof the genital—causation of neuroses, Charcot’s example is the most vivid, as related byFreud:... At one of Charcot’s evening receptions, I happened to be standing near the greatteacher at a moment when he appeared to be telling ... [a friend] some very inter-esting story from the day’s work. ... A young married couple from the Far East: thewoman a confirmed invalid; the man either impotent or exceedingly awkward, ...[His friend] must have expressed his astonishment that symptoms such as the wife’scould have been produced in such circumstances. For Charcot suddenly broke inwith great animation, “Mais, dans des cas pareils c’est toujours la chose génitale, toujours ...toujours ... toujours”; and he crossed his arms over his stomach, hugging himself andjumping up and down. ... I know that for one second I was almost paralyzed withamazement and said to myself: “Well, but if he knows that, why does he never sayso?”31Now Reich was expanding on the role ofles choses génitales, yet Freud was rejectingit. Whatever comfort Reich may have taken from the thought that he, too, would have toendure the “splendid isolation” that Freud had experienced in his fight for the “sexual eti-ology in the neuroses,” Freud’s coolness in 1926 was a severe blow. Although Freud’s over-all attitude to Reich remained positive, his lack of support for Reich’s most controversialcontributions at this time made the latter’s position increasingly perilous within the psychoanalytic organization.Over the years,the most common criticism ofReich’s orgasm theory has remainedthe argument that there are neurotic, even psychotic persons who are orgastically potent. In1960, the novelist James Baldwin expressed this criticism quite succinctly: “There are no for-mulas for the improvement of the private, or any other, life certainly not the formula ofmore and better orgasms. (Who decides?) The people I had been raised among had orgasmsall the time and still chopped each other up with razors on Saturday nights.”32Considering how incisively Baldwin has written about sex on other occasions, onewould think he would know better than to speak so glibly about having orgasms. However,Baldwin is answering Reich the same way analysts in the 1920s (and many still today)answered him: people can “have orgasms” and still be terribly disturbed. This may or maynot be true, but in fairness to Reich’s argument one should at least take into account hisdescription oforgasmic functioning,and demonstrate its presence in cases of neuroses.The concept of orgastic potency met with some serious consideration, startingaround 1945.In that year, Otto Fenichel, Reich’s old friend but by that time quite separatedfrom him,wrote his celebrated book The Psychoanalytic Theory ofthe Neuroses.In it,he com-Myron SharafFury On Earth102éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"mented: “Persons in whom the genital primacy is lacking, that is, orgastically impotent per-sons, are also incapable of love. Warded-oif pregenitality has resisted this primacy; after it isfreed from entanglements in the defense struggle, its forces are included into the genitalorganization. It is primarily the experiences of satisfaction now made possible that once andfor all abolish the pathogenic damming-up.”33Although Fenichel’s language is more Reichian than Freudian, this quote is a goodexample of how Reich’s equation of orgastic satisfaction and emotional health crept intosome of the analytic literature, minus—indeed ignoring—the stormy debates of the 1920s.Another example is evident in Erik Erikson’s highly influential book Childhood andSociety. Without citing Reich, Erikson gives a key emphasis to orgastic potency: “Genitality,then, consists in the unobstructed capacity to develop an orgastic potency so free of pre-genital interferences that the genital libido (not just the sex products discharged in Kinsey’soutlets) is expressed in heterosexual mutuality, with full sensitivity of both penis and vagina,and with a convulsion-like discharge of tension from the whole body.”34It has to be stressed that there are still no systematic studies, from Reich or anyoneelse, comparing a large number of orgastically potent persons with orgastically impotentones. All we have are some studies relating aspects of sexual responsiveness and overall psy-chological functioning. In a careful review of the research literature correlating women’sreports of their degree of sexual responsiveness with their general psychological well-being,Seymour Fisher concluded that no clear relationship could be established35.Such research studies do not speak directly to Reich’s work. In my view, the con-nection Reich made between sexual and emotional health is not especially valuable whenpresented as a question ofdegree that the “better”the sex life, the “better” the mentalhealth.This is clearly simplistic. Far more fundamental but much less testable is his assump-tion that orgastic potency goes hand in hand with a kind of psychological functioning thatis radically different not only from neurotic or psychotic behavior, but also from much thatpasses for “normal.”As recent arguments over the “vaginal orgasm” make clear, it is easy to be side-tracked from the significance of Reich’s central thesis. In discussing female sexuality, Reichfollowed to a certain extent traditional psychoanalytic thinking in giving favored status tovaginal over clitoral sensation. Indeed, in agreement with Karen Homey, he stated that vagi-nal sensation existed in childhood, and disputed the Freudian notion that the girl makes atransition from a predominantly clitoral sensation in childhood to vaginal excitation afterpuberty. However, for Reich the key point was not clitoral versus vaginal orgasm. For him,orgasm could not be considered complete if it was only felt in the genitals (vagina, clitoris,or both).Involuntary participation of the whole organism was its indispensable attribute.A related argument against Reich’s concept has been advanced by Herbert Marcuseand Norman O. Brown. They claim, essentially, that Reich espoused the “tyranny of geni-tality.” Thus, Brown writes:Ifthe repression ofsexuality is the cause of neuroses, what alternative to neuroses7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-1926103éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"does mankind possess? Psychoanalytic therapy is supposed to undo repressions and bringthe hitherto repressed sexual energy under the control of the patient’s ego. But what is thepatient’s ego going to do with his own sexuality, now brought under his conscious control? ... The crux of the problem is not the repression of normal adult genital sexualitybut what to do with infantile perverse pregenital sexuality. For Reich ... the pregen-ital stages would simply disappear if full genitality were established...36Brown is incorrect. Reich emphasized that society represses pregenital as well asgenital sexuality, leading to the failure of some persons to reach the genital level at all andthe vulnerability of others to regress to pregenital levels. And, according to Reich, given fullgenital expression, pregenital impulses and conflicts do not “disappear”; they simply losetheir significance and their power to disrupt healthy genitality. Unlike Brown and Marcuse,Reich didsee healthy psychosexual development culminating in genitality, just as walkingbecomes the preferred mode of human locomotion. One final reaction is not so much toReich’s work in particular as it is to an entire cultural trend that he influenced—the increas-ing emphasis today on sexual happiness in general and orgastic satisfaction in particular.Critics have argued that to talk so much about “theorgasm”and to make qualitative distinc-tions about orgasm renders people dissatisfied with what they do enjoy and contributes toan endless quest for more intense and ecstatic experience; it entails jumping from therapistto therapist, partner to partner, sex manual to sex manual.There is definite merit to this argument. Undoubtedly, many people today havemade an “ideal” of the orgasm. Reich was very cognizant and very critical of this trend, evenif his polemics against “armored man” and “orgastic impotence” contributed to the cult ofthe orgasm. But the concept of orgastic potency itself can no more be blamed for such dis-tortions than Freud’s concept of the unconscious can be blamed for empty party-talk about“motives” and “complexes,” or Sartre’s existentialism for one or another mindless binge. AsGoethe said long ago:“The people must make a sport of the sublime. If they saw it as itreally is, they could not bear its aspect.”Where does this review of both the skepticism and the enthusiasm greeting Reich’stheories lead us? I do not believe there is any clear verdict. Reich’s concepts and findingsconcerning the orgasm are testable, but they are not easily verified or disproved.There are three lines of evidence, however, that do seem to suggest Reich waslargely right. The first was the fruitfulness of the concept in terms of his own work clinical-ly, socially, and experimentally. The second is the response to the concept. In spite of all theridicule,it did not die;on the contrary, it has influenced a good deal of current thought andcontemporary therapeutic endeavors. This argument is not conclusive: wrong ideas haveoften been quite influential. Nonetheless, it says something about the viability of Reich’swork. Indeed, a good case can be made that much of the current sexual monomania andobsession reflects a widespread and deep yearning for what Reich described as orgasticpotency.Myron SharafFury On Earth104éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The third factor is unabashedly personal After all the arguments pro and con, onecomes back to one’s own experience. From my own, Reich’s argument is convincing, thoughnot in all details. When I experienced or believed I experienced what Reich termed “orgas-tic potency,” the emotions and sensations were sufficiently different from other forms oferoticism that I can never refer to the latter as “normal,” even though for me the orgasticexperience occurs quite rarely.At the same time I believe that until his last years, Reich was overly optimistic aboutpeople achieving orgastic potency through Reichian therapy or through more sex-affirmingsocial attitudes.I also believe that Reich underemphasized the wide range of functioning possiblewithin what he termed the state of orgastic impotence. One can be more or less productive,happy, loving under such conditions. To use an analogy, it was as though Reich had discov-ered that the overwhelming majority of people were blind. He argued first for a treatmentthat would address the blindness, then in later years for its prevention. He was not especial-ly concerned about the wide variation among blind people in their capacity to work, be lov-ing, hear, or taste. More, he saw in the general emphasis on this variation an evasion of theissue of blindness.7 : Reich’s Work on Orgastic Potency: 1922-1926105éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"8 : Personal Life: 1920-1926Reich’s initially successful psychoanalytic career was paralleled by several develop-ments in his personal life. Sometime in the early part of 1920, Reich met Annie Pink, a sev-enteen-year-old girl who was about to enter medical school at the University of Vienna.Reich knew her from the youth movement and as a fellow medical student. However, he gotto know Annie well when she came to him for analytic treatment. She was referred by OttoFenichel, a good friend of Annie’s oldest brother, Fritz, who was killed in World War I.Annie was an attractive, highly intelligent young woman. She was the daughter ofAlfred Pink, a successful Viennese exporter-importer, who was well educated and cultured,a man who provided the best for his children. His first wife, Annie’s mother, had died ofinfluenza during World War I. Not long afterward, Alfred married a woman named Malva,whom Annie and others regarded as warm and kindly but very Victorian in outlook1.Details of the relationship between Willy and Annie during their courtship and theearly years of their marriage remain unclear. In later years, Reich rarely talked about thosedays, and what remarks he did make about Annie were embittered by the subsequent expe-riences and divorce. Those who knew the couple during the first years of their romancemade a good deal of the fact that the relationship started in the context of Annie’s being apatient of Reich’s. A mutual friend, the child analyst Edith Buxbaum, described the Annieof that period as “spellbound” by Reich—“It would turn any patient’s head to have her ana-lyst fall in love with her.”2When Reich became aware of the strong feelings between them, he suggested thatthey should discontinue the analysis and that Annie should see someone else for treatment.Reich was certainly aware of the transference and counter-transference feelings involved ina love relationship between patient and analyst. He advised a “cooling-off” period and achange in therapist to see to what extent transference factors were determining the relation-ship. However, he also believed that there were “real” feelings possible between patient andtherapist, and that these could not be entirely ascribed to transference.Annie went to another,older analyst, Hermann Nunberg, but Edith Buxbaumbelieves that she was still so under Reich’s spell that this second analysis could not proceedproperly. Some years later, Annie entered analysis with Anna Freud.Thus, Reich’s relationship with Annie started under something of a cloud concern-ing analytic practices, just as it was to end in part over disputes between Reich and other ana-lysts about the future direction of psychoanalysis.It is probable that an element of defying taboos entered Reich’s relationship withMyron SharafFury On Earth106éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Annie. His first paper on “The Breakthrough of the Incest Taboo in Puberty” had dealt withhis mother’s violation of the taboo against extramarital sexuality and his own consciousincestuous wishes. In his behavior toward Annie, Reich acted analogously to his mother, andalso lived out his own dangerous, unfulfilled adolescent wishes: he took the taboo object,defying the father (the analytic community and its standards). It is not my intention to reduceReich’s attraction to Annie to her significance as a taboo object but, rather, to call attentionto his willingness, for rational and irrational reasons, to violate taboos in his personal as wellas his scientific life.All sorts of complexities arise when personal analyses are combined with profes-sional relationships. Nunberg saw Annie as a patient at the same time that he and Reich wereprofessional colleagues. Disputes arose between them, with Nunberg siding against the kindof resistance analysis Reich advocated. How much the relationship between the two menwas clouded by the fact that Nunberg treated Annie, we cannot say. But it is worth notingthat almost all the younger analysts were in treatment with the relatively few senior analyststhen available in Vienna. These senior men treated not only the young candidates but alsooften their mates, lovers, and friends. Undoubtedly, in discussions among themselves andwith Freud, the older men could preserve confidentiality yet still transmit a nonverbal opin-ion derived from the analytic situation by a shrug, an enthusiastic nod, a pained look. At leastPaul Federn’s son, Ernst, suggests that this subtle interplay between judgments from person-al analyses and evaluations of professional work often occurred3.In Reich’s case, Federn, Sadger, and Nunberg—all older analysts—were familiar notonly with his clinical work but with the most intimate details of his life.An anecdote related by Lia Laszky further illustrates the complexities of such inter-actions. During his analysis with Isidor Sadger around 1919, Reich had talked about Lia and,it seems, had urged Sadger to take her free of charge when Reich relinquished treatment.Sadger agreed. However, around the time that Laszky began her analysis, Sadger grew jeal-ous of Freud’s approval of Reich—a much younger man and a relative newcomer to the psy-choanalytic scene.Sadger would become irritated when Laszky talked positively about Reich,thereby giving her a sure way to provoke her analyst’s anger.On her side, Laszky was irritated by the fact that Sadger used the analytic setting tofit her with a diaphragm.This step arose ostensibly through his concern with “actual neu-rosis”: when Sadger heard that Lia practiced coitus interruptus, he urged her to use adiaphragm and proceeded to fit her for one4.In the context of defending his own behavior, Reich spoke critically of Sadger andothers.He said that under the guise of doing a medical examination they would touch theirpatients genitally. On the other hand, when he was strongly attracted to a patient he wouldstop the treatment and allow time for the patient and himself to decide what they were goingto do5.Although it was certainly not uncommon for an analyst to marry a former patient(Bernfeld and Fenichel, for example), the psychoanalytic community disapproved Reich’sstep in marrying his former patient.8 : Personal Life: 1920-1926107éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"One other aspect of Annie may have contributed to Reich’s sense of conquest. LikeGrete Bibring and Lia Laszky, Annie certainly belonged to the educated, upper middle classof Vienna. Reich’s own social background was impressive, but nevertheless he was raised inan outlying former province, and in Vienna that was a stigma. Reich may well have wantedto win a woman from the upper middle class; the same kind of ambition he showed in theprofessional world for the proper credentials could also at this time have affected his choiceof a partner. He had “lost” with Grete and Lia; now he won with Annie. His choice was tocause problems later when Reich’s more radical sides emerged fully, clashing with Annie’smore conventional, indeed, somewhat snobbish characteristics6.Not especially interested in psychoanalysis, Mr. Pink knew enough to be suspiciousabout “transference”; but although he was hardly enthusiastic about his daughter’s relation-ship with Reich, he posed no objections. However, there was pressure from both Annie’sfather and her stepmother against premarital intercourse. In the early 19405 Reich with somebitterness told his daughter Eva that Annie’s stepmother, Malva, had inadvertently run intoAnnie and Willy while they were walking arm in arm. When they returned to Annie’s house,she congratulated them on being engaged, a step they had no intention of taking at thattime. More seriously, on another occasion late at night Malva opened the door of Annie’sroom and found Annie and Willy in a sexually compromising position. She told her hus-band, Annie’s father, about her “discovery” and he in turn demanded that Willy marryAnnie. The young couple were very angry about his decree7.How much the marriage was determined by the attitudes of Annie’s father andstepmother is hard to say. Whatever Reich’s motives, he married Annie on March 17, 1922,one week before his twenty-fifth birthday. If the act of legal marriage reflected some capit-ulation to Victorian standards, the form of it did not. It was a simple secular service withonly two other people in attendance: Edith Buxbaum, Annie’s closest friend; and OttoFenichel, Reich’s closest friend and colleague8.We must pause a moment here to see in Malva’s “discovery” one of the emblemat-ic events in Reich’s life. First, her behavior was strikingly similar to that of the young Willyspying on his mother and tutor.Both Malva and Willy report the “crime” to the father, whothen imposes “law and order.” If the effect of the early family tragedy was to weave its wayinto many of Reich’s concepts, the result of Malva’s and Alfred’s intervention was to beapparent in Reich’s later slashing critique of the social taboo against premarital intercourse.Although Reich was near the end of his medical studies when they married, Anniestill had several years to go. Briefly, she and Willy lived with her parents, which indicates thatthe relationship with the Pinks could not have been so bad at that time. Moreover, Annie’sfather paid some of her medical school expenses and was to be financially helpful through-out the marriage9.Annie and Willy moved into their own small apartment shortly after their marriage.On April, 27, 1924, their first child, Eva, was born. When Annie also became a practicinganalyst, the young family moved into a larger apartment where both had their offices as wellas their living quarters. Throughout his life, Reich’s living and work settings were alwaysMyron SharafFury On Earth108éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"closely connected.In most ways the couple’s way of life was not so different from that of many oftheir colleagues. It was quite common for analysts to have mates who were also in the pro-fession. It was also common to avoid a stereotypic division of their roles with the husbandas breadwinner and wife as homemaker. However, the Reichs seemed to have carried theequal partnership further than most, even though Reich was surely the dominant partner.For example, each had a separate bank account, just as each had an independent career.Fairly early in their marriage there seems to have been the understanding that extramaritalrelationships were not proscribed, although this particular alternative would have been moreattractive to Reich than to Annie. Reich’s jealousy in relationships does not seem to havebeen a factor with Annie, who described herself as being the jealous one10.In setting up the apartment, Reich made a point of obtaining good furniture andother household items. An interesting contradiction should be noted here, one that IlseOllendorff, his third wife and co-worker during the 1940s and early 19508, also observed.Reich could be very generous to others and very generous to himself. He usually wore goodclothes, ate good food, and, in general, enjoyed many of the conveniences and pleasures offine possessions. At the same time, he could often resent daily living expenses. Moreover,when consumed by some cause that required a large financial investment, he could at timesskimp on all personal expenses in order to dedicate most of his resources to his work. Hisfear of the “trivial” existence sometimes manifested itself as a dislike of domestic demandsthat drained one’s energy and money.Around 1926 or so, this financial conflict seems to have arisen in his relationshipwith Annie. At that time, the “cause” that began to consume him was political. Exactly whenReich’s strong social involvement originated is not clear. My conjecture is that sometime inthe mid-i92os Reich began to donate money toward supporting the left-wing faction of theSocial Democratic Party. Then his commitment to social concerns and Annie’s focus onhousehold needs began to clash.Intense as Reich was about his work,his early years as an analyst included consid-erable socializing with his colleagues. There are photographs of Annie and Willy from thisperiod playing ball at the beach with friends, at parties, on ski trips. Never again will we seephotos ofReich so entirely at play. One photograph shows Annie and Willy caught mid-air;another captures Willy and some of his colleagues making teasing faces for the camera.These photos ofReich contrast sharply with formal portraits taken during the same period.One from 1921, when Reich was only twenty-four, reveals an extremely serious, determinedman, with a deep, penetrating, and somewhat hurt-angry look around the eyes.In the first halfofthe 1920s, too, Reich’s sense of personal mission was somewhatsubdued by his intellectual and organizational subordination to Freud. He saw himself asworking forpsychoanalysis. He was to continue this personal vision for several more years;only after 1927 would he fight the psychoanalytic—organization and the older Freud—inthe name ofthe younger Freud. Until this time, he interacted with his young colleagues asone of Freud’s children. Never again was Reich to enjoy the kind of social belonging to a8 : Personal Life: 1920-1926109éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"professional world that he experienced between 1921 and 1926.Reich at this period could be a warm and generous friend. Richard Sterba, then ananalytic candidate, recalls how helpful Reich was to him around 1924. He referred privatepatients to Sterba and also helped him to obtain his first position at the psychoanalytic poly-clinic. As good friends, the Reichs and the Sterbas enjoyed skiing and summer outingstogether. The relationship was not without friction—few relationships with Reich were.Sterba remembers how competitive Reich could be, a competitiveness revealed once byReich’s dismay that, when skiing downhill, Sterba fell only three times whereas Reich tooksix spills.The relative harmony of those years also characterized Reich’s relationship with hisfirst daughter, Eva. Both he and Annie, very absorbed in her upbringing, kept carefulrecords of her development. Eva was not initially brought up in accord with Reich’s laterconcepts of self-regulation. In the early 1920s, Reich was imbued with many traditional psy-choanalytic notions of child rearing. He shared particularly the concern of many analystsabout fixation at a pregenital level of development, a fixation that presumably could resultfrom deprivation but also from overindulgence. Thus, as an infant Eva was raised deal ofattention to the exact details11.Although the couple were very much concerned in principle with Eva’s upbringing,they delegated many of the daily tasks to nursemaids. They led busy professional lives anddid not have a great deal of time for their children. (A second daughter, Lore, was born in1928.) Nor was it a “child-oriented” home in the American sense of the term. For example,the children ate separately in European fashion; and Reich always expected them to behaveproperly when eating out or on public occasions.The most traumatic personal event in Reich’s life at this time concerned his broth-er, Robert. Robert had risen rapidly in the transportation firm he joined after World War I,and in 1920 he was sent to Rumania to handle shipping traffic on the Danube. In 1921 hemarried Ottilie, who, as noted earlier, had been a friend of his and Willy’s for several years.Two years later the young couple had a daughter, Sigrid. Then, in 1924, tragedy struck:Robert contracted tuberculosis and the family returned to Vienna for expert diagnosis andtreatment12.Willy was at the station to meet them. He also arranged for Robert to be checkedby the best specialists in Vienna. The diagnosis of severe tuberculosis was confirmed and asanatarium in northern Italy was recommended for treatment.The family moved to Italy. Contrary to Ilse OllendorfFs later report13, Ottilieinformed me that the move posed no special financial problem for Robert and his family.Robert’s firm thought so much of him that they kept him on the payroll during his illness.In addition, help was available from Ottilie’s fairly affluent family. They therefore had noneed to turn to Willy for financial assistance, but he was helpful in terms of sending medi-cine, especially morphine, to relieve the pain Robert suffered. He also sent detailed informa-tion about a medical procedure to help with breathing—an interesting sidelight in view ofReich’s later work on the relation between respiration and emotional blocking.Myron SharafFury On Earth110éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"The issues that arose between Willy, on the one hand, and Robert and Ottilie, onthe other, concerned more personal matters. The first quarrel occurred when Reich wrotehis sister-in-law’s parents urging them to persuade Ottilie to take her daughter from thesanatarium lest they also become infected with tuberculosis. Ottilie was outraged that Reichshould have worried her already anxious family. At the sanatarium she and her daughter livedin separate quarters from Robert and took other precautions against infection. In any case,she felt it was no business of his to interfere in this fashion, especially without even notify-ing her14.One can only speculate as to why Reich behaved thus. As a result of his experienceswith his own parents, he always had fears that one marital partner could negatively affect theother. For example, in later years he would sometimes be concerned that a co- worker’s mate,if not interested in or even hostile to Ms work, would turn the partner against Reich. Hespoke of the hostile person’s attitudes “infecting” or changing the position of a sympathet-ic person. In the case of his brother and sister-in-law, the danger of infection was more lit-eral.Even more upsetting to both Ottilie and Robert was the fact that Willy did not visithis brother during the many months of his terminal illness in Italy. Reich wrote, he sentmedicine,but he never came himself. Robert was deeply hurt. Once he received a long,warm letter from Willy. He shook his head and said something to the effect that his broth-er had a split personality. Ottilie asked why he said such a thing and Robert replied: “Becausehe can write a letter like that and still not visit me.”15When Ottilie later asked Reich directly why he had not come to Italy, Reich repliedthat he had been busy, and besides he had not felt like it. Undoubtedly, Reich was busy andhe was a careful custodian of his talent. Often he took the stance that his dedication to workprevented his participation in a host of activities others deemed essential. He was not a manwho attended weddings, funerals, and the like. But equally clearly the roots of the explana-tion lay much deeper.He may have felt guilt because Robert had helped him during the dif-ficult postwar years, perhaps at some sacrifice to Robert’s own well-being. As Robert wenton to a successful business career, Reich had no occasion to repay this help. Yet other sto-ries Ottilie tells suggest a greater concern on Robert’s part about being fair to Willy in moneymatters than Willy reciprocated.One has to allow for the possibility tht Ottilie would like to paint Robert, her firsthusband,in a more favorable light than her more famous brother-inlaw. Nonetheless, thehypothesis of guilt on Reich’s part seems reasonable. Robert died in the sanatarium in April1926.One can often infer Reich’s experience of guilt from noting what he blames othersfor. In the case of Robert’s death, he blamed his well-to-do relatives for not being morehelpful to Robert during the impoverished postwar years16.Robert represented Reich’s last tie with his family of origin. Reich had witnessedfirsthand the painful deaths of his mother and father under conditions where he felt someresponsibility. Perhaps he was not up to witnessing directly the fatal illness of his brother,to experiencing again the terrible helplessness, for there was now nothing to be done to8 : Personal Life: 1920-1926111éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"reverse the coming of death. Perhaps, too, he feared that he would be infected by his dis-eased brother the last heir but one of a tragedy-ridden family.Yet when all is explained or guessed at, the incident reflects the kind of callousnessReich could sometimes show toward people once very close to him, who had helped him,but who for one reason or another were no longer relevant or for whom nothing could bedone. This was particularly the case when someone died. I recall his reaction to the death ofa promising young psychiatrist who had been in training with him and whom he had likedvery much. When Reich heard the news, he simply said grimly, “The best die young,” andwent on about his business.If Reich personally distanced himself from Robert during the illness, he was closeto Ottilie after Robert’s death. Ottilie was now in difficult straits: she had no career, andthere was a young child to care for. In the fall of 1926, she moved in with the Reichs in orderto pursue a professional training in Vienna. At the time Ottilie was interested in becominga nursery-school teacher, and Reich helped her not only to obtain a formal education butalso with various extras that he was in a position to arrange, such as a psychoanalytic semi-nar on adolescence given by August Aichorn. Ottilie was as grateful to him for this attentivehelp as she had earlier been disappointed by his behavior17.At the close of1926,Reich’s personal life revealed a similar mixture of success andstorm clouds on the horizon as his professional life did. By 1926, he had won considerableattention through his writings, his seminar, and his clinical skills. At the same time, severalinfluential analysts now disliked him intensely and Freud himself was giving less than fullsupport to the more controversial aspects of Reich’s contributions. As far as the marriagewas concerned, Annie felt that until 1927 it was a happy one and their mutual life togethera satisfying existence. But for Reich, things were more complex. He undoubtedly felt somedissatisfaction with his marriage. Annie was less than enthusiastic about the direction hiswork was taking in emphasizing the function of the orgasm, though there is no evidencethat she opposed it at that time. And what ancient scars and griefs his brother’s death trig-gered can only be imagined.Myron SharafFury On Earth112éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"PART IVThe Radicalization of Reich: 1926-1930113éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"9 : Reich’s Illness and Sanatarium Stay in Davos, Switzerland: Winter 1927The year 1926 had been a difficult one for Reich. It included Freud’s coolnesstoward his orgasm theory and character-analytic technique, the death of his brother,and incipient problems in his marriage. How much his emotional state contributed tothe tuberculosis that sent Reich for several months’ rest during the winter of 1927 toa Swiss sanatarium we cannot say. There is evidence to suggest that Reich thought itdid, especially his depression over Freud’s reaction to his work1. Whatever the role ofFreud in precipitating the illness, Reich’s relationship with his mentor was clearly muchon his mind during his sanatarium stay. A photo of Reich taken at the sanatarium inDavos in February 1927 bears the inscription in Reich’s handwriting: “Conflict withFreud.”Reich’s sense of being rejected by Freud may not have been limited to scien-tific disagreements. Use Ollendorff has reported that Annie Reich stated Reich soughta personal analysis from Freud and was refused2. The implication in this account isthat Reich sought the analysis prior to his TB attack, but Annie Reich is not quoted asspecifically stating the time of the request. Rather, she emphasized the heavy impacton Reich of Freud’s refusal.My own conjecture is that both request and refusal occurred before the illness,and that they were among the precipitants of the “conflict with Freud,” together withthe theoretical differences between the two men.This view is based in part upon theseverity ofReich’s depressive reaction at the time of his illness. Reich himself nevermentioned his request to be analyzed by Freud and Freud’s refusal to anyone that Iknew.He much preferred to concentrate on his scientific disagreements with Freud; itwould be entirely characteristic of him to keep silent about such a personal rejection.Freud’s stated reason for refusing Reich’s request was his reluctance to takeViennese colleagues into treatment, on the grounds that to do so would complicatetheir work relationship. However, Freud was never hesitant to break a rule when it suit-ed him.He had analyzed Helena Deutsch and Heinz Hartmann, for example, both ofReich’s generation and both resident in Vienna. In short, we do not know Freud’s realreason for denying Reich’s request.One can infer the degree of rejection Reich suffered in 1926-27 from his laterremarks about his relationship with Freud. In the late 1930s, Ola Raknes, a Norwegianpsychoanalyst,was in treatment with Reich, well after Reich had left the psychoanalyt-ic movement. At one point Reich said to his patient that when Raknes was through withMyron SharafFury On Earth114éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"his treatment, Reich would perhaps have some sessions with him in order to deal withReich’s own dependency on Freud3. It speaks to the weight of pain Reich carriedabout the separation from Freud, the seeds of which began around the Davos time,that he could consider Raknes as his own future therapist. I know of no other occa-sion when he mentioned the possibility of going into therapy with a former student.Some ten years later, Reich would often refer to Freud and how much Freudstill meant to him. In 1948, when I knew Reich, he recalled Freud’s pleasure in the early1920s when Reich vigorously collected “dues” from his fellow analysts in order to helpdefray the costs of the psychoanalytic polyclinic. More ruefully, Reich also recalled thetime when, as a medical student undergoing analysis, he had impetuously hidden a fel-low student under the couch so that he could learn what analysis was all about by over-hearing a session. “Freud was very angry when he heard about it,” Reich commentedwith an embarrassed smile.Significantly, Reich often compared his own work and life with Freud’s.“Breuer first had the energy principle and he ran from it,” he said in 1948. “Then Freudhad it and he ran from it. Now I have it and I haven’t run yet.” He was intent on avoid-ing the mistakes he thought Freud had made. He often spoke of how Freud’s organi-zation had “killed him”—meaning pushed him in a more conservative direction. But,as he saw it, Freud had permitted it to happen. “Freud was interested in fame, I amnot—that is the difference between us.” Reich could defend Freud and compete withhim in the same sentence. I once commented that Freud seemed to have been a veryreserved person. Reich denied it: “No, he was very sparkling—not as sparkling as me,though.”4Judging from how much Reich still thought of Freud in 1950, one has someidea of how painful the conflict must have been in 1927 when Reich was thirty, even ifone is surprised by his strong feelings to Freud’s reaction to the orgasm theory. For theentire thrust ofFreud’s thought at that time for example, his emphasis on the intricatebalance between instinctual gratification and repression necessary for psychologicalhealth, on the one hand, and “civilization,” on the other—was moving in a directionquite different from Reich’s work. Reich tried to solve this problem by returning to theearly Freud, the Freud who had emphasized the role of genital frustration in the devel-opment of the neuroses, in particular, Freud’s paper “On the Most Prevalent Form ofDegradation in Erotic Life.”However, I would suggest that Reich practiced a kind of self-deception in notrealizing the full extent to which he was challenging much that was dear to Freud, atleast to the Freud of the 1920s. Such self-deception seemed necessary to preserve hisimage of himself as the “loyal son” of Freud, on the one hand, and the fighter for gen-itality, on the other,Nor is it hard to understand why this composite picture was so important. Forwe recall what grief had befallen Reich the boy over the issue of genitality.Now the issue between his mentor, Freud, and himself also concerned genital-9 : Reich’s Illness and Sanatarium Stay in Davos, Switzerland: Winter 1927115éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"ity. Aside from this issue and it is a big aside the relationship between Freud and Reichcould have continued very positively. It is true that Freud had also been critical ofReich’s oral presentation of some characteranalytic principles. In general, however, hehad responded very favorably to those publications of Reich where the orgasm func-tion and its affirmation were not central; he had been especially positive about Reich’smonograph on The Impulsive Character, where the few references to genitality were verymuch in accord with psychoanalytic tradition.Still, Reich could not be the “good son” at the price of forgoing orgasticpotency. Nor was he prepared yet to stop being any kind of son and go his own way.He wished to “undo” the bad relationship with his father and the trauma of their jointcomplicity in the mother’s death. This time the good father and the good son wouldunite together in support of their shared undertaking genitality. But Freud would nothave it that way.One must also pay attention to what Reich does not stress. Singularly absent inReich’s remarks to various people about this period was any mention of the impact ofhis brother’s death. We cannot say for certain what that impact was, but we can specu-late that to his growing sense of his “differentness” within the psychoanalytic move-ment was also added his familial sense ofseparateness. He alone was destined to sur-vive the tragic family experiences that had killed his mother, father, and brother. What“survivor guilt,” to use Robert Lifton’s phrase, Reich experienced we do not know.Some of that guilt was reflected in his conviction, expressed at various times, that hehimself would not die a “normal” death—that he would be killed or at least “die alonelike a dog.”5Certainly, Robert’s fate increased his loneliness and his need to repair the“wounds” to family and self by working all the more intensely and without regard tocosts, by being all the more willing to bear whatever insults might come his way becauseof his discoveries.The time at the Davos sanatarium provided Reich with an enforced rest, a kindofmoratorium in which he could sort out his relationship with Freud, regroup hisenergies, and plan for the future. This sabbatical followed eight years of intense activ-ity centered on psychoanalysis. Reich had taken vacations before in Austria andSwitzerland, but usually very active, social ones—skiing in the winters, going to thelakes in the summer,and being with family and friends. Now he was away from the nor-mal work routine, family, and familiar surroundings.The Davos crisis came when Reich was turning thirty, a phase of life Daniel J.Levinson has termed “the age thirty transition” the time when a man is likely to ques-tion and reappraise the previous years of establishing himself in the world6. Reich hadspent most of his twenties building a career. Were it not for his “fanaticism” about his“hobby horse,” many associates said, there was no telling how far he might go in con-tributing to psychoanalysis clinically, theoretically, and administratively. At this junc-ture, Reich had to consider what would happen to his relationship with the psychoan-Myron SharafFury On Earth116éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"alytic organization, his “second home,” as he once put it, if he persisted in followingthe direction he believed his work was taking him.His marriage was also running into trouble. Like his career, it was in manyrespects quite successful; but Annie did not share Reich’s emphasis on genitality, and itwas characteristic of Reich to want those close to him to be fully involved in whatev-er occupied him. Several years later, Reich was bitterly critical of the institution of“lifelong, compulsive monogamy,” partly on the grounds that a partner chosen in one’stwenties may be incompatible with one’s psychic development at thirty.7It is clear thatwhen he formulated this criticism, he had his own experiences much in mind.The weight of all these varied concerns is reflected in photos of Reich fromthe time. The photo carrying the inscription “Conflict with Freud” shows a broodingman—the depth of the hurt is striking. Another picture from Davos shows him stand-ing on the snowy steps in front of the sanatarium, his legs in a wide stance, hands onhips, the look still hurt and angry but also determined, as if to say: I will be my ownman, no matter what.It was during the sanatarium stay that Reich began a custom he was to contin-ue throughout his life—that of sending pictures of himself to absent friends. InVienna,Grete Bibring received one from Davos that bore the inscription: “So that youwill recognize me.” Reflecting on Reich many years later, she saw a biblical reference inthat inscription and cited it as evidence of Reich’s incipient psychotic megalomania, Amore benign interpretation might regard it as a half-ironic reference to his literalabsence and to their drifting apart as friends, something that was indeed happeningduring this period.There is no doubt that at Davos Reich was taking himself more seriously thanever. From that time on, he saw himself as living or wanting to live a heroic destiny.And from that time on, he had a sense of his remarkable powers. He recorded his lifein voluminous detail, keeping careful notes and diaries of his intellectual and personaldevelopment.To a high degree he had that “fierce love of one’s own personality” thatIsak Dinesen noted as a hallmark ofthe creative individual.The sense of himself as a remarkable person, perhaps a historic figure, wasHeightened—I am suggesting—during Reich’s stay at Davos. His daughter, Eva,thought that this was the time he “found out who he was.”8Even those who deploredthe kind ofperson he found himself to be and the kind of person he became saw thesanatarium period as critical. Annie Reich believed that before Davos, Reich had beenan essentially “normal”person, whatever difficulties there may have been. After it, shefelt he became a much angrier, more suspicious individual, and, indeed, that a psychot-ic process dated from that Time9.Which of these two opinions—that of his daugh-ter or his first wife one prefers, or which blend of the two, depends on how one viewshis later development.Reich rested at Davos, but he also worked. One task was going over the proofsofDie Funktion des Orgasmus.The last chapter ofthe manuscript was entitled “The9 : Reich’s Illness and Sanatarium Stay in Davos, Switzerland: Winter 1927117éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Social Significance of Genital Strivings”—Reich’s last chapters in books or last para-graphs in articles very often signaled upcoming concerns10. Here he argued that muchsadistic destructiveness, as well as the anxiety states of “actual neuroses,” stemmedfrom dammed-up sexual excitation. Here, too, he began his critique of negative socialattitudes toward genitality. In particular, he stressed the ways these attitudes destroyederotic happiness. The split between tender and sensual feelings in the male, the deepsuppression and repression of genital strivings in the female, made marriage a sexualmisery. The dogma of premarital chastity (with the proviso that men could sow theiroats with prostitutes and other “bad” women) ruined what it was alleged to protect,happiness in marriage.Reich’s social criticism was still embryonic at this stage. Lacking any explicitsocial viewpoint, he made references to connections between sexual suppression and“capitalist bourgeois morality,” but did not provide any details. Still, after Davos hewould never again limit himself to the study of the individual without regard for socialfactors as he had largely done earlier.The social criticism of the book’s last chapter is undeveloped and stronglymixed with more traditional Freudian notions that Reich would later abandon. Forexample,Reich kept to certain Freudian concepts such as the death instinct in partbecause he half-believed them, in part because he did not want to step too far out ofline from psychoanalytic doctrine as enunciated by Freud. Reich himself was not clearin early 1927 as to what should be the stance of the parent and educator toward thechild’s pregenital impulses. For he shared the prevailing analytic concern that unduegratification of these impulses would prevent the development of “genital primacy.”And he also shared the view that “sublimations” of pregenital impulses were importantfor both the individual and society. His focus at this time was on the kind of genitalfulfillment in early adulthood that would withdraw energy from the inevitable conflictsbetween the pregenital and Oedipal phases of development.In Die Funktion des Orgasmushe had said nothing about affirming childhood oradolescent heterosexuality, so this view represented a step toward a rather differentviewpoint.In contrast,Reich appears to have been more outspoken in public lectures. Inthe early 1920s, Ernst Papanek, who directed the Social Democratic Party’s education-al efforts for young workers and teachers, had invited Reich as well as Otto Fenicheland Siegfried Bernfeld to speak on psychoanalytic themes to young worker groups.Reich spoke weekly on “sex education” for several years; then Papanek was forced tostop inviting him.Reich, he said, was an extremely effective speaker: “He was too goodto let him continue. If he had been more mediocre, we would have carried him—hewould not have attracted so much attention.” 11 What concerned Papanek was thatReich’s positive attitude toward premarital sexuality appealed to many young people butmade some quite anxious.In particular,he was concerned that Reich’s lectures wouldalienate the parents of the young people. The Social Democratic Party wished toMyron SharafFury On Earth118éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"increase its strength among Catholic voters and Reich’s positions were likely to fright-en rather than attract them.Sometime in the late spring of 1927, Reich left Davos cured of tuberculosis. Ibelieve he also left Davos more intent than ever on finding a way to make genitality amatter of public concern, on changing the public attitudes toward contraception, abor-tion, and premarital and extramarital love life. But further influences and opportunitieswere necessary to convert this readiness into practical endeavor, and to facilitate thedevelopment of his social position.119éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"10 : July 15, 1927, and Its Aftermath: 1927-1928When Reich returned to Vienna from Davos in the late spring of 1927, there wereno radical changes in his routine. As in most people’s lives, these important turns were grad-ual developments rather than rapid shifts in design or structure. The significant points onlybecome clear in retrospect.Reich resumed his flourishing psychoanalytic practice, his position as assistant chiefof the Vienna Psychoanalytic Polyclinic, and his leadership of the technical seminar for ana-lytic candidates. Starting around this time, he appears to have been one of the analysts mostsought after by American students visiting Vienna eager to learn the new discipline of analy-sis. During the late 1920s, several future luminaries of American psychiatry became patientsor students ofReich.Finally, whatever Reich’s inner conflicts with Freud, Freud continuedto endorse his work with the technical seminar and to welcome his contributions to psycho-analytic theory and technique. Indeed, it was in 1927 that Reich gained what he had longsought a place on the executive committee of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, now grant-ed on the basis of his leadership of the technical seminar.Reich was also determined to continue his marriage. Soon after his return fromDavos, Annie and he decided to have another child, partly in an effort to improve their rela-tionship. Lore, born on March 13, 1928, was the fruit of this decision. It is interesting thatin his later clinical work Reich paid close attention to the reasons why people have children.He specifically looked for the desire to give fruit to sexual love through offspring, and wassharply critical of the kind of motivation he may well have experienced himself in 1927, thedesire to “make things better”in a marriage by having a child.External events as well as Reich’s own inner disposition were, however, to lead himin a different direction from that of the prominent analyst with a growing family. Some yearslater, Reich was to review these political events in an unusual book entitled People in Troublel.A few words about this work are in order first.People in Troubleis a remarkable volume, not least because it is so highly personal. Itdescribes events that occurred largely between 1927 and 1934 when Reich became an activeparticipant in the impassioned,sometimes frenetic political wars of Vienna and Berlin. Morethan in any other of his writings, Reich gives a detailed description of his feelings aboutthese experiences. But historically, it is difficult to date what feelings occurred when. Forexample, he described many events of 1927, but one cannot always be sure whether hisreflections and emotions about these events actually occurred in 1927 or later, when hetransmitted the narrative to paper.Myron SharafFury On Earth120éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"People in Troublewas not in fact published until 1953, when Reich was living in therelative social isolation of Rangeley, Maine, and long after his radical political phase hadended. In his introduction, Reich wrote that “the book is composed of different writingsfrom the years between 1927 and I945-”2However, a careful examination of the text sug-gests that most of it was written between 1936 and 1940, although Reich drew heavily onnotes written earlier. It is hard to date different sections because Reich had the disconcert-ing habit of adding material to suit his purposes. The bulk of a section might have been writ-ten in 1936, but put aside. If Reich found a newspaper clipping in 1942 that fitted his theme,he would then insert it into the text without necessarily indicating that this material wasadded some years after the rest of the chapter was written.By 1927 the conservative Christian Socialist Party had gained national leadership,although “Red Vienna” remained in the hands of the Social Democrats. The bitter politicalpolarization between the Christian Socialists with their rural Catholic constituency, many stilldevoted to the monarchy, and the urban, secularly oriented Social Democrats was moreintense than ever. Like Germany with its paramilitary factions, the Christian Socialist Partyin Austria was linked to an independent military group, the Heimwehr, which received finan-cial support from the Fascist Italian government. The Social Democrats had their armedunit,the Schutzbund, which, unlike the Heimwehr, was clearly under civilian control.Individuals on both the right and left, inside and outside the armed factions, participated insporadic violence, though rightists were the more frequent perpetrators. Moreover, conser-vative judges often gave right-wing perpetrators light jail sentences, a policy that furtherinflamed the Social Democrats and contributed to severe tension throughout the country,but especially in Vienna3.One terrorist attack that particularly enraged the political left occurred on January30, 1927, in Schattendorf, a small Austrian town near the Hungarian border. A group ofWorld War I veterans, all members of the Heimwehr, wantonly shot into a crowd of SocialDemocrats,killing a man and a young child.The accused were brought to trial but acquit-ted on July 14.Whatever the fairness or unfairness of the verdict—and historians to this daydebate what actually happened at Schattendorf—it enraged the workers of Vienna. On July15,a physician who had come to Reich for an analytic session told him that there was aprotest strike of Viennese workers, the police were armed, workers were occupying the innercity, and several people had been killed. Reich interrupted the session to join the crowd outin the streets.The direct confrontation between police and crowd was limited to the area in frontof a courthouse, which the protestors had set fire to as a symbol of fraudulent justice. Thenthey tried to block the firemen. With quick strokes Reich paints a vivid word picture in thesubsequent People in Trouble: the excitement, the impulsive movements of the crowd, themounted police riding into the demonstrators, the ambulances with red flags coming to col-lect the wounded.Reich continued to mill about with the large crowd. He was struck by the difference10 : July 15, 1927, and Its Aftermath: 1927-1928121éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"between Marxist descriptions of such clashes and what he witnessed. The rhetoric had the“capitalists” fighting the “workers.” For Reich, on the other hand, there were only workersin uniforms shooting at workers without uniforms4.Reich was exaggerating a little. Marxist theory did not say that capitalists foughtworkers; rather, the agentsof capitalists, e.g., the police, fought workers. Reich’s very naiveteallowed him to be impressed by simple facts without the distortion of a highly refined the-oretical lens. Before July 15, Reich was a man of the political left, although he had not care-fully studied social theory in general or Marxism in particular. His intense scrutiny of Marxand Engels came after these events.When Reich arrived home to tell his wife what was happening, she went with himto see the events for herself. So Reich and Annie joined the crowd still watching the court-house fire. A police cordon started to move toward them. When they were a short distancefrom the crowd, an officer gave the command to fire. Reich jumped behind a tree and pulledhis wife after him.The shooting lasted three hours, and left eighty-nine people dead and over a thou-sand wounded. Vienna had not seen such carnage in the streets since the days of the 1848revolution.Reich then describes how it felt to be a demonstrator and how the various factionslooked to an involved and extremely curious participant. Most striking to Reich was hisimpression of the police. He emphasized not their brutality but their mechanicalness. Reichsuddenly saw them as rigid automatons. He, too, he realized, had been just such a robotwhen he fired on the enemy in World War I5.Even though Reich felt a strong desire to throw himself upon the police, herestrained it. At the time he believed that he had held back out of cowardice. Reich’s atti-tudes toward the various political factions were charged with feeling. He was indignant at thevacillation of the Social Democratic leadership, particularly its failure to have theSchutzbund participate in the demonstration.He was enraged by the Christian SocialistParty,which he saw as triggering the events through the orders to the police. At the time hewas quite sympathetic to the Communist Party, then a minuscule group with only severalthousand members throughout Austria.He expected the leaders of the party to take anactive role in “leading and organizing” the spontaneous demonstrations of July 15; heexcused their absence from events on the grounds that they were “still preparing them-selves” And on the same day, Reich enrolled in a medical group affiliated with theCommunist Party6.Reich came to recognize that the Communists were far too few to be an effectivelever for change, and placed his more realistic hopes on the “left opposition” group withinthe Social Democratic Party, which shared Reich’s views of its weak and vacillating partyleaders.But he did not allow this Social Democratic commitment to stop him from partici-pating in the Communist Party, even though such action could be grounds for censure, andpossibly expulsion, by the Social Democrats. So, too, could the stringent criticisms Reichbegan to make ofthe party leadership. However much he may have regretted or downplayedMyron SharafFury On Earth122éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"it later, his strongest political sympathies in the late 1920s lay with the Communist Party’sideology. One must bear in mind that being a Communist in Vienna at that time did not sig-nify a commitment to violent revolution, as communism had in czarist Russia in 1917. Onthe other hand, Reich and the Communists believed in principle that violence from the rightshould be met with equal force.We have seen Reich’s impressions of July 15. Now the significance of that day ashe experienced it at the time and from his later insights should be dealt with.The reader ofPeople in Trouble, written nearly ten years after the event, cannot butbe impressed simply by how important that day was for Reich. Throughout his life therewere benchmark experiences in which the broodings of earlier days, months, and years coa-lesced and sharpened. These crucial happenings in turn led to new experiences, to new “lifestructures” (in Daniel J. Levinson’s phrase), and to the selection of still different experiences.The events surrounding his mother’s death were one such set of experiences; his meetingwith Freud another.Now he had partaken in an experience not just crucial to himself but to an entirenation, for the events of July 15 seared the Austrian consciousness. The Vienna uprising pre-saged many later political events of the 19303 in Europe: initial sporadic violence by extremeright-wing individuals or groups,supported by the silent sympathy and protection of a con-servative government or party; hesitancy and striving to avoid civil war by the Socialist gov-ernment or party; the growing strength of increasingly repressive right-wing forces; dissen-sion on the left (especially between Socialists and Communists); and the final victory of areactionary regime.The events of July 15 drastically increased Reich’s sense of political urgency. Hesought a way to stem the conservative tide, a tide he felt the Social Democrats should havevigorously and courageously opposed.Just as character analysis could free the individual from inner oppression andrelease the flow of natural energies, so—Reich hoped—radical Socialists and Communistswould rescue the masses from external oppression and release a natural social harmony, a“classless”society.Put somewhat differently, Reich’s desire for strong action on the politicalleft paralleled his clinical search for measures that would bring about rapid individual change.Thus,genital breakthroughs might liberate the patient, in spite of unresolved psychic con-flicts and without prolonged analysis. Social revolution led by decisive leaders might lead tosocial breakthroughs in spite of all the fears and contradictions among the citizens. Reich’sattempt to integrate his clinical and social hopes would form the crux of his endeavorsbetween 1927 and 1934.The next point concerns the interaction between his more established clinical workand his embryonic social endeavors. In his clinical work, Reich had been increasinglyimpressed by “character armor”—the automaton-like quality of patients, their lack of spon-taneous feeling. Undoubtedly, his clinical observations alerted Reich to the same kind ofarmored,affect-lame behavior on the public scene. At the same time, his immersion in thepolitical arena broadened his approach to his patients. Prior to 1927, Reich’s analytic writ-10 : July 15, 1927, and Its Aftermath: 1927-1928123éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"ings had not dealt with social issues, with the exception of his criticism of conventional sex-ual standards. Like most analysts, Reich emphasized the patient’s inner difficulties in copingwith reality. But the Vienna demonstrations made Reich more aware of the way destructivesocial factors interfered with the treatment of emotional disturbances as well as the way theycontributed to their development.Finally, what about our own reactions to Reich’s account of the events of July 15?How contemporary it all sounds! Just as Reich’s case histories in Character Analysismake usfeel that we know these people, that they are not merely relics from the 1920s, so his descrip-tion of July 15 reminds us of what the United States experienced in the 1960s and early1970s. Reich’s method of social investigation, his deep immersion in the day-by-day happen-ings, and his method of reporting—including his own feelings and reactions—all remind usof the “new journalism.” He was not the cold, objective historian; he was the man, he wasthere, he suffered.As the political situation steadily deteriorated from the viewpoint of the left, Reichworked with both the radical left of the Social Democrats and the Communist Party. On onelevel, he was involved in immediate political issues, the tactics and strategy of social strug-gle.On another,he was asking deeper questions about the psychological receptivity of theaverage individual to one or another political outlook. He termed this focus “mass psychol-ogy.” In 1927 his insights were only dimly formulated, if at all; but over the next ten yearsthey would far exceed in significance his immediate concern with political tactics.From this perspective, Reich gradually came to realize that the main problem lay inthe character structure of the masses themselves, especially their fear of freedom andresponsibility7. However, in 1927, as I have suggested, this view did not dominate his think-ing. Reich began to take part in demonstrations of the unemployed. He shared the commu-nist illusion that the working class would soon overthrow the yoke of capitalism and builda new socialist order8.He was to experience keenly the futility of such demonstrations. The police coop-erated to the extent of permitting small gatherings. If the meeting looked as though it mightbecome troublesome,they would quietly disperse the “illegal” demonstrators. Even moresignificantly, workers with jobs did not take part in the demonstrations for fear of losingtheir employment. Nor did marches of the unemployed impress the onlookers. Reich’s hopethat the unemployed would move the people on the street into action did not materialize.Occasionally, the marchers would shout “Down with Capitalism!” or “Freedom and bread!”,but the people on the sidewalk were soon used to that and hardly paid any attention.Dismal as these demonstrations were, Reich continued to take part in them, firstbecause of his concern for the unemployed and his political conviction at that time thatsomehow, some way, radical change could develop, but also because he learned so muchfrom the demonstrations. Once again we can note Reich’s love of the concrete and the prac-tical.He immersed himselfin these first sociological endeavors much as he had earlierthrown himself into psychoanalytic practice—with some guiding theoretical formulations,Myron SharafFury On Earth124éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"but with a hunger for direct experience.Reich’s political commitments as well as his eagerness to learn are well illustrated byhis involvement in one demonstration that had farcical overtones.In the midst of the growing civil unrest, the leaders of the Heimwehr scheduled alarge march for October 7, 1928, in Wiener-Neustadt. The leaders of the Social DemocraticParty felt that they, too, had to act lest their restive membership become even more embit-tered. So they scheduled a countermarch in the same city and on the same date.The small Communist group had decided that it should participate in the demon-stration with the express purpose of disrupting the marches of the other groups. As Reichput it: “They ‘mobilized’ their workers’ defense for October 7 ... with all the earnestness ofrevolutionary courage—I do not say this mockingly an organization of about two hundredand fifty unarmed men undertook to fight armed and organized groups of a combined forceof about forty thousand men; that is ‘to preventtheir march.’ I can bear witness, for I wasamong those two hundred and fifty men.”9Reich’s capacity for humor and self-irony is evident in the descriptions of hisadventures in Wiener-Neustadt Along with two other physicians, he was supposed to carryknapsacks containing bandages; this little band formed the “medical wing” of theCommunists’“fighting troops.” Proceeding “inconspicuously,” the Communist phalanx wasto form the “spearhead” of a revolutionary movement to disrupt the proceedings—exactlyhow, no one knew. To increase its camouflage, the 250-man army got off the train one stopbefore Wiener-Neustadt. At the nearby village they were greeted by a party functionary alsotrying to look “inconspicuous,” and taken to the local inn, owned by the Social Democraticmayor of the village.Early the next morning, the little band was betrayed by the mayor: they awoke tofind the inn surrounded by police. Thereupon the “phalanx” divided into two factions—onein favor of immediately fighting the police, the other in favor of withdrawing to fight anoth-er day. Reich, disliking surrender but fearing some senseless bloodshed, was chosen as mod-erator for the militants.The majority voted to withdraw. So, flanked by the police, they allmarched back to the village station and Reich noticed the indifferent faces peering from thewindows of working-class homes. “ They are only taking away some Communists,’ we couldalmost hear them say.”The band of Communists managed to get off the train before it arrived in Vienna’sCentral Station,so they walked home without police escort. But that was small consolation,especially for Reich, who would long wonder how he could ever have participated in such acrazy venture. At the time one of his explanations for his actions that day was that if theCommunists were “right” and “set an example,” others would “have to recognize it.”10Toa marked degree Reich’s expectation that people would recognize what he recognized wasbased on his conviction that what should happen wouldhappen. Again and again this char-acteristic was to emerge, in spite of his deep awareness of why people could not recognizewhat he did.One also has to be aware of Reich’s tendency, as he recalled the late 1920s, to mix10 : July 15, 1927, and Its Aftermath: 1927-1928125éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"his insights and awareness of a later period with his contemporary attitudes. Immediatelyafter the fiasco of October 7, it seems likely that the perfidy of the Social Democratic mayorand of the Social Democratic leadership in general was more on his mind than the “indif-ferent faces” he met on his way home, though the latter image had planted itself in Reich’sthought, to grow in significance just as the significance of the mayor’s actions would wane.But in the context of 1928, Reich’s own injured pride required a more tangible target thanthe “indifference” of the masses.Reich’s involvement in the events of 1927-28 highlights his steadily increasing com-mitment to radical politics. However, he was to shape his own contribution to fit his uniquegifts.Myron SharafFury On Earth126éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"11 : The Application of Sex-economic Conceptson the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930In addition to joining political demonstrations, Reich felt he could serve a spe-cific function within the revolutionary social movement—a function determined by hispsychoanalytic orientation.From the early 1920s, Reich had given talks on psychoanalytic subjects to vari-ous lay groups. By 1927, however, he felt dissatisfied with this effort. People did notunderstand complex psychological issues, such as the castration complex.If working people did not respond to psychoanalysis as usually presented, theywere also turned off by the purely economic analyses presented by the leftist politicalparties.To capture their interest, Reich sought a perspective that would stimulate themto look at what was relevant to their own emotional needs.One way he did this was to shift the subject matter of his talks from the moretheoretical aspects of psychoanalysis to the concrete problems of people’s sex lives. HereReich began what he was to call the “sex-pol” movement: a complex theoretical and prac-tical effort—first, to help the masses with their sexual problems; and second, to renderthe sexual needs of normal love life relevant political issues within the framework of thelarger revolutionary movement1. Questions of sexual life and child upbringing arousedburning interest among the public.Reich wished to take other steps, besides public speaking, to reach the public. Hedrew considerable support from his friendship with working men, especially a mannamed Zadniker.On the basis of his experiences with Zadniker and others like him,Reich evolved the idea, later to be abandoned, that industrial workers were sexuallyhealthier than middle-class persons. Clearly Reich felt Zadniker to be an open, genuineperson, with an objective, natural attitude toward sexuality. Indeed, Zadniker must havestruck Reich as more like himself than many of his professional colleagues, with theiremotional reserve and subtle moralisms.Parenthetically, we should note Reich’s gift for finding the kinds of intellectualand emotional support that he most needed.In the early 1920s there had been Freud, theyouth movement, and his analytic colleagues, who gave direction to his burgeoning inter-est in psychology, especially the psychology of sex. In the late 1920s, when Reich’s eluci-dation of the orgasm function, combined with the general political unrest, was leadinghim toward a wider social orientation,he discovered the social sweep and revolutionaryhopes of Marxism. Emotionally and socially, he found in many working people an open-127éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"ness and simplicity he sorely missed among his more “cultivated” friends and colleagues.Zadniker strongly supported Reich’s view that he should work as a physicianrather than as a politician within the leftist movement. Reich should help the people med-ically and educationally. Accordingly, during the spring and summer of both 1928 and1929, Reich engaged in a kind of “community psychiatry,” or at least his version of it.Reich, together with a pediatrician, a gynecologist, and his friend Lia Laszky (who hadbecome a nursery-school teacher), would go out several days a week into the suburbs andrural areas around Vienna. They would drive in a van, announcing their visits in advance.Interested persons gathered at a local park and Reich’s group spoke to them about sexu-al matters. Reich would talk with the adolescents and men, the gynecologist with thewomen, and Lia with the children. Upon request, the gynecologist would also prescribeand fit contraceptive devices2.Sometimes the group would go door to door distributing pamphlets with sexu-al information. Most of these activities were of course illegal. More than once the groupwas chased away by the police, and on a few occasions members of the “team” werearrested on spurious charges. One of these was that the children, who enjoyed exploringthe van, were “corrupted” by contact with sex information and devices. However,charges against the group were usually dismissed. They were just “nuisances.”In addition to the sex counseling, Reich would also give political talks in theevening. He began with questions or problems people had raised in smaller discussionswith the team during the day. For example, young men and women complained abouthow the lack of money forced them to live at home, hampering their sexual freedom.Others spoke of their fear of unwanted pregnancies. Reich would deal with some of thepersonal aspects of these problems. However, at some point he would invariably connectthem with larger political issues. People could not have a satisfying sexual life withoutadequate housing for all; hence this kind of public policy required a truly Socialist soci-ety. The problem of unwanted pregnancies could only be met by progressive sex legisla-tion,in other words,the legalization of birth control and abortion, the kind of legisla-tion the Christian Socialists always opposed. In their turn, the Social Democratic leadersavoided these issues; the public should pressure them to take a strong positive stand.Reich had an unusual ability to start with a concrete example and then find thelarger concepts and implications contained in that example. This ability was important inall his teaching,but it especially facilitated his contact with nonprofessional audiences.While he was frank in answering questions, he had considerable sensitivity to the“touchy” issues for any given audience or individual questioner, and he would approachthem with care.In simple language he could appeal to people’s longing for a richer sex-ual-emotional life, while recognizing the fears and guilts they experienced at the idea ofsuch an existence. This was true of the audiences that attended sex-political meetings.With professionals, Reich could use the same kind of sensitivity to highlight the differ-ences between his position and that ofothers in a way that often was abrasive.Reich had a superb speaking style. Dr. Kurt Eissler, a prominent psychoanalystMyron SharafFury On Earth128éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"and Freudian scholar, heard Reich give a few political talks in Vienna in the late 1920s.He found him to be a “marvelous” speaker, eloquent and forceful3. A Danish newspa-per reporter who heard Reich speak in 1934 wrote: “He is a phenomenon... . Themoment he starts to speak, not at the lectern, but walking around it on cat’s paws, he issimply enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He isnot only eloquent, he also keeps his listeners spellbound by his sparkling personality,reflected in his small, dark eyes.”*4Reich’s political speech always concluded the evening. Before it, there would bevarious kinds of entertainments studded with “messages.” For example, the team wrotenew lyrics, with sex-political themes, set to the music of Marlene Dietrich’s popular songfrom The Blue Angel“Falling in Love Again,” which Lia Laszky was called upon to sing.And the audience participated in group singing to guitar accompaniment5.Once again, one has the uncanny sense of Reich’s anticipation of later politicaldevelopments on the left. He was well aware that the average citizen was bored to deathby the usual approaches of the left the long speeches on economic policy, foreign affairs,and the like. In his practical sex-political work, everything he did was geared to involvingpeople.In 1928, Reich dreamed that within a short time many teams would be going outwith vans and offering the people sexual information and counseling, together with amore socialist political orientation. But this plan never materialized, partly because oth-ers did not share his commitment, partly because his own modus operand! changed.Reich was providing most of the driving force behind the enterprise and almost all thefinances (the van, the cost of printing pamphlets and announcements, etc.). He threwhimselfinto the sex-pol work with all his usual gusto.As Laszky remarked: “He lovedit—it was meat and potatoes to him.”A further characteristic of Reich’s style was that while he was the recognizedleader ofthe enterprise,the team atmosphere was open, frank, and collegial. In all thesex-political work, as in the technical seminar, Reich encouraged the open acknowledg-ment ofmistakes,taking the lead himselfin describing his errors; each day’s activitieswould be scrutinized afterward.Laszky did not continue to be so enthusiastic about the sex-political work. Afterthe initial excitement,she was disappointed. In her view, the expected movement of peo-ple toward a more radical political stance did not occur. Some were very interested in thesexual information and in obtaining contraception; others were quiet and just listened.But few made the connection between the issues of personal sexual life and larger polit-ical concerns.11 : The Application of Sex-economic Concepts on the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930129éditionsles atomes de l’âme*The same characteristics were apparent when I heard him speak before small professional groups in the 19405and 19505. He usually spoke from a very few notes, which permitted him to look directly at his audience, and spokevery fluently. He had a way of emphasizing key points through added vocal force, which, combined with his witand directness, kept audience interest high. The repetitions and variations, combined with the inflections andcadences of his voice, gave a musical quality to his speech. He was the most charismatic speaker I have ever heard."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Such a connection was essential to Reich. The concepts he was formulating dur-ing these years and was to detail in The Mass Psychology of Fascismsome years later may bebriefly summarized:Sexual suppression and repression made the masses of people cowed and uncrit-ical. The energies congealed in the character defenses, the “armor,” were unavailable forrational social criticism. Preoccupation with emotional problems in general and sexualconflicts in particular led to political apathy. Lack of clarity about sexual issues and,worse, lies and deceit regarding human love life undermined the capacity of people to seethrough political chicanery.Conversely, if people were more in touch with their sexual desires, their waywould be paved for closer contact with larger social issues. As the women’s movement inthe United States was to emphasize many years later, it was necessary to begin with thepersonal, to politicize the personal. The political right—especially Nazism, as we shallsee—was well aware of this. Its leaders constantly used sex-political propaganda, but ofa negative kind. They played on people’s fear of their own impulses and their fear ofchaos by calling upon the need for moralistic defenses, for “law and order,” for protec-tion against the “Bolshevik menace” to the family. In this sense, Reich wrote, the CatholicChurch was the most powerful sex-political organization in the World6.Reich was not so naive as to believe that simply informing people about theirsexual needs would necessarily lead to changes either in their capacity for sexual fulfill-ment or in their political ideology. From his character-analytic work he knew too well thestrength of the defenses, the anxieties and guilts that surround man’s impulsive life. Inthis period of his work, Reich dealt with sexual need in a way similar to the Marxists’ han-dling of economic want. That is, one heightened awareness, one “raised consciousness”about the problem. It could only be out of a concern with the problem that solutionswould follow. To the criticism that his sex-politics merely heightened the awareness ofsexual need without heightening the capacity for gratification, thereby rendering the suf-fering more acute,Reich answered:... The same objection holds with regard to hunger... .We admit:consistent [sex-political] work brings silent sufferings to the surface,it accentuates existing conflicts and creates new ones, it makes people incapableoftolerating their situation any longer. But at the same time it provides libera-tion: the possibility of fighting against the social causes of the suffering. True,sex-political work touches upon the most difficult, most exciting and most per-sonal aspects ofhuman living.But does not the mystical infestation ofthe masses do thesame thing?What matters is, to what purpose one or the other is being done. Hewho has seen light in the eyes of the people in [sex-political] meetings; he whohas listened to and had to answer thousands of questions of a most personalnature,knows that here is social dynamite which can make this world of self-destruction stop and think7.Myron SharafFury On Earth130éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Everywhere he went, Reich was impressed with the people’s need for emotionalhelp. And he strove to find some solution between the very brief contact of van missionsand the long-term psychoanalysis of the individual, a socially useless endeavor becauseof the time it took and the small number of available therapists.In January 1929, Vienna newspapers carried notices about new sexual hygieneclinics for workers and employees, opened by the Socialist Association for Sex Hygieneand Sexological Research, which Reich had founded. Four psychoanalytic colleagues andthree obstetricians joined Reich in starting the organization8.The sex hygiene clinics were opened in different districts of Vienna, each onedirected by a physician. As the clinics were extremely busy, the lack of time on the partof the staff became a painful reality. Each case required about half an hour to be diag-nosed conscientiously, and many persons who came needed considerable help. Whatexactly Reich and his associates did in these consultations is not clear. His sex-politicalwritings are not as rich in case examples as are his psychoanalytic papers. However, weknow that he gave prominence in his early clinical experiences to the problems of abor-tion, contraception, and adolescent sexuality.Abortion was the most immediate problem because the first patients tended tobe women wishing to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Reich’s approach to this issue wasamazingly advanced. He was impatient with, indeed outraged by, current debates aboutrestricting or enlarging the categories of “medical indications” that would permit theinterruption of pregnancy. For him the outstanding fact was that the women didn’t wantchildren and that they were incapable of bringing them up in a healthy way. Reich alsostressed the terrible economic and social conditions under which many of these expec-tant mothers lived.Using emotional and economic factors as legitimations for abortion did not sat-isfy Reich at all. The essential point was that women should have the right to terminatetheir pregnancies,regardless of their medical condition or social-economic situation. Norshould this position be justified on the grounds that, with this right, women would havejust as many children as before, but “under joyful conditions.” Reich was not concernedwhether or not the population declined because oflegalized abortion. In his own workhe did everything he could to arrange illegal abortions, where necessary, for women whosought to end their pregnancies but who did not have the “proper” indications. In sodoing, he often took grave legal risks.Reich met with little success in seeking any political support for the legalizationofabortion. Social Democratic leaders who privately were in favor of legalized abortionrefused to take a public position for fear of alienating the Catholic vote. The CommunistParty avoided the issue, in part because Marx had rejected the Malthusian position thatthe number of births should be restricted if social misery was to be eliminated. Marxargued that this stance diverted people from the “real” problem of radically changing thesocial order.11 : The Application of Sex-economic Concepts on the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930131éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Thus, the whole issue of abortion languished in terms of direct political action.If the masses were unwilling to politicize the personal, the parties were unwilling to per-sonalize the political.The liberal position in Europe on contraception in the late 1920s was primarilyto fight for it within the context of marriage. A more radical position was to advocatethe right of unmarried adults to obtain contraceptive devices.Yet by 1929 Reich was affirming the right of adolescents to learn about and toobtain contraceptives. His path to this position was somewhat more gradual than hisadvocacy of abortion and contraception for adults. For, of course, the issue of contra-ception for adolescents was inextricably linked to adolescent sexuality.The question posed itself in practical terms when young people came to the sexhygiene clinics and asked not only for help with sexual problems per se but for adviceabout contraception. Since these young people ranged in age from fourteen to twenty,Reich found himself wondering: Should one give contraceptives to young people four-teen or fifteen years old? Reich was not to answer this question in print with a clear-cut affirmation until1929, but he was grappling with the answer from at least 1927 on. His advocacy of ado-lescent sexuality was a more radical and also a lonelier position than,say, his support for“abortion on demand.” Since it was also extremely controversial, it was not something heembarked upon lightly.That he could not evade the issue seemed clear to him, “if one wished to stickto the problem of the prevention of the neuroses.”9Reich began to study adolescentsmore closely, in terms of their psychodynamics and in their social milieu. He got to knowthose who came to the clinics as well as those he met in various leftist youth meetings hisconclusions about adolescent problems were not based simply on a subsample of youthwho might be termed “disturbed” because they attended the clinics.Reich noted that some young people had sexual partners, while others wished tofind one.In both instances,problems occurred: internal ones such as premature ejacula-tion,frigidity,shyness, depression, and nervousness; social ones such as the lack of con-traception, inadequate space to be with a partner, and parental disapproval. Stressing theinteraction between internal and external factors, Reich would say, for example, that pre-mature ejaculation was based on Oedipal conflicts but it was also more likely to occurwhen genital intercourse was carried out in one’s clothes and hastily10.In his counseling work in clinics and youth organizations, Reich felt the need fora practical position.He had to reject the choice of abstinence, if for no other reason thanthat it was totally unrealistic. Most adolescents (especially males) masturbated. Evenamong those who did not, sexual daydreaming was common, a form of psychic mastur-bation that is stimulating though not gratifying. Reich also rejected masturbation, that“pale substitute of love,” in D. H. Lawrence’s phrase. He held that guilt feelings withmasturbation are much more intense than with sexual intercourse because it is moreheavily burdened with incest fantasies (conscious or unconscious). Incidentally, theMyron SharafFury On Earth132éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"prevalence of masturbation rendered suspect one psychoanalytic argument against ado-lescent intercourse, namely, that intercourse would decrease the cultural achievements ofyouth by weakening “sublimation.”11Why should one assume that sexual intercourseinterferes with achievement while masturbation does not? Reich was initially optimistic about the number of adolescents who could behelped if they were exposed to sexual enlightenment, given some counseling, and pro-vided with contraceptive aids. As he put it, “The younger the boy or girl concerned was,the more quickly and more fully they swung around after listening to only a few clarify-ing sentences.”12This implies a change in functioning as well as intellectual orientation. Yet Reichwas also aware that deep-rooted adolescent problems would not be altered simply byintellectual change. Some years later, reporting on a successfill, brief consultation with anadolescent couple, Reich noted that such successes of simple counseling were unusual,due to the depth of the neuroses in most of the young people who came to the clinics.The truth probably lies somewhere between the two quotations. Edith Jacobson,a prominent psychoanalyst when I interviewed her in the 1970s, worked with Reich in asex-political clinic in the early 1930s. 1 asked how much such counseling could accom-plish with adolescents. She replied succinctly: “Surprisingly much.”13Two further central interests in sex-political work developed for Reich in thisperiod: the issue of childhood sexuality and the problem of marriage.The depth and extent of sexual problems in adults and adolescents led Reich tostress prevention rather than treatment. By 1929, he was referring to sexual disturbancesas an epidemic among the masses,and counseling as being only ofvery limited value.In 1930,in a speech before the World League for Sexual Reform (WLSR), Reichreported that over a period of eighteen months his centers for sexual counseling hadseen seven hundred cases14.Ofthose seeking help, approximately 30 percent could besuccessfully advised, while the remaining 70 percent had problems of such severity thatthey could not be treated by short-term counseling. Nor were there other availableresources to help them. Most existing public health programs either totally ignored neu-roses or prescribed bromides. While a few public programs offered psychotherapeutictreatment, the permitted length of treatment was entirely inadequate.Such figures strengthened Reich’s conviction that the neuroses could only beattacked prophylactically. In his WLSR speech he vehemently insisted on certain socialmeasures: adequate housing and nourishment; availability of contraceptives and abor-tion;social support for the care and education of children; and a change in the marriageand divorce laws. These changes could only be implemented, Reich believed, in a social-ist economy.But even if they were realized, a large number of adults and adolescentswould still remain sexually crippled because of irreversible pathology generated duringchildhood irreversible, that is, without long-term individual treatment.The logic ofthis reasoning led to an exploration of childhood factors that con-11 : The Application of Sex-economic Concepts on the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930133éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"tributed to neuroses. In keeping with the Freudian tradition, which emphasized theOedipal period of development (ages four to about six), Reich began by analyzing socialattitudes toward the child’s genital impulses. Punishment and threats of punishment byparents and educators toward the child’s masturbation were still common (as, indeed,they still are in many circles). However, the more progressive attitude, especially amongthe psychoanalytically oriented, consisted in ignoring masturbation or gently distractingthe child from it.Reich opposed both attitudes. In counseling parents, he stressed the need foraffirming childhood masturbation. Throughout his life, Reich put considerable emphasison the distinction between affirming childhood sexuality and toleratingit. Toleration wasinsufficient to counteract a generally sex-negative culture. Moreover, if sexual behavioris distracted, the child cannot help but feel that he or she is doing something wrong inmasturbating15.Toleration also contributed to the mystification of sex surrounding it withsilence, the mysterious distractions when the child touches its genital. For Reich this wasin some ways more dangerous than direct suppression. Authoritarian education was atleast clear: Sex outside marriage was sinful. In much permissive education, sex simply didnot exist;the child had to deal not with thunderbolts of punishment but with a secretivefog.Reich distinguished between two kinds of childhood masturbation. One typeexpressed the natural urge for genital pleasure. The second was connected with anxietyand anger: the child used auto-eroticism not primarily for genital pleasure but as a way ofdischarging fear and rage. Reich affirmed the first kind of masturbation; the secondalready indicated some degree of emotional disturbance in the child.Reich took the same basically affirmative stance toward heterosexual play in chil-dren. Indeed, over the years he came to stress the importance of this activity even morethan he did masturbation.Reich’s daring in affirming heterosexual play in the 1920s is highlighted if wecompare his position on the subject to that ofDr. Benjamin Spock in the 1950s. Spockis rightly considered permissive toward the emotional expressions of the infant and child.However, of sexual play, he wrote:Ifyou discover your small child in some sort of sex play alone or with others,you’ll probably be at least a little bit surprised and shocked. In expressing yourdisapproval it’s better to be firmly matterof-fact rather than very shocked orangry. You want him to know that you don’t want him to feel that he’s a crimi-nal. You can say, for instance, “Mother doesn’t want you to do that again,” or“That isn’t polite,” and shoo the children off to some other activity. That’s usu-ally enough to stop sex play for a long time in normal children16.In discussing masturbation, Spock warns against making threats or dispensingMyron SharafFury On Earth134éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"severe punishment. He goes on to say that even if we magically could rid ourselves ofour discomfort at masturbation, he doubts that it would be in the best interests of thechild: “There is lots of evidence that all children feel guilty about masturbation whetheror not their parents have found out about it or said anything about it”17I do not know the evidence that Spock is drawing upon. But one line of theo-rizing, forcefully advanced by Anna Freud, posits that “there is in human nature a dispo-sition to repudiate certain instincts, in particular the sexual instincts, indiscriminately andindependently of individual experience. This disposition appears to be a phylogeneticinheritance, a kind of deposit accumulated from acts of repression practiced by manygenerations, and merely continued, not initiated, by individuals.”18This kind of genetic speculation concerning an “archaic unconscious” stands insharp contrast to Reich’s emphasis on social factors determining the anxiety and guilt thatso often surround genital impulses.Reich emphasized that one benefit of masturbation and particularly of hetero-sexual play was to mitigate the intensity of the Oedipal configuration the child’s passion-ate love for the parent of the opposite sex and his equally strong hatred and fear of theparent of the same sex. He argued that the complex would be less charged if the childhad a sensual outlet with peers.It would also be less intense if there were considerable communal involvementin the care and education of children. And it would be less intense if the parents, partic-ularly the father, were generally less authoritarian, if they interacted with their children ina more human, fallible way.All of these conditions Reich found in Bronislaw Malinowski’s report on thesexual life ofthe Trobriand Islanders19,which he first read in 1930.Indeed,Malinowskiargued that the presumed “universal” Oedipus complex was absent among this people,an absence he attributed to the matrilineal organization of the family. Yet the findingspermitted Reich to make somewhat different emphases, namely, on the affirmation ofboth childhood and adolescent sexuality among the Trobrianders. It further fitted Reich’stheoretical framework that Malinowski found the Trobrianders to be a warm, open peo-ple,relatively free of the neuroses, perversions, and sadism so common in the “civilized”world. Malinowski became one of the few authors Reich would cite frequently.Further stressing the demystification ofsexuality during childhood, Reichargued that nakedness among children and between adults and children should be accept-ed as matter-of-fact. His rationale was as follows:Among the infantile sexual impulses, those aiming at the observation and thedisplay of the genitals are particularly well known. Under present educationalconditions,these impulses are usually repressed at a very early time. As a resultof this repression, children develop two different feelings: first, they developguilt feelings because they know that they are doing something strictly forbiddenifthey give in to their impulses. Second, the fact that the genitals are covered up11 : The Application of Sex-economic Concepts on the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930135éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"and “taboo” gives a mystical air to everything sexual. Consequently, the naturalimpulse to look at things changes into lascivious curiosity20.Reich’s main point was that educators and pupils, parents and children, whenbathing and swimming, should feel free to appear naked before each other when it wasnatural to do so.Not surprisingly, Reich felt that the child’s questions about sex should beanswered frankly. But even to this he added a novel provocative twist: How should weanswer a child who asks if he or she can witness parental intercourse? Reich dismissedthe argument that watching parental intercourse was harmful. After all, analytic experi-ence showed that practically every child listened anyway, and many children observedintercourse between animals. Reich concluded that the only valid argument against thechild’s witnessing parental intercourse did not concern the child but the parents: it wouldinterfere with theirpleasure21.Reich’s position on this issue was distorted by his opponents, including manyanalysts. He was accused of advocating that children should watch intercourse and thathis children did. Neither accusation was true. His point about the right argument—theargument for adult privacy—against such observation was lost.Reich’s emphasis on nudity and the question of the child’s observation ofparental intercourse diminished over the years. Indeed, it is interesting to speculate whyhe had emphasized these as much as he did. In The Impulsive Character, published in 1925,Reich after all had stressed the dangers of overstimulation to the child. He noted howoften impulsive patients expressed “precocious sexuality” in childhood, witnessed the“primal scene” in a blatant form, and so on. From his disguised self-history, we knowReich himself felt he had suffered severely from having overheard sexual intercoursebetween his mother and tutor.By the late 1920s,I believe that Reich was reviewing his own sexual history andcoming to rather different conclusions from those of the early 1920s. Some of his earlyexperiences werecertainly provocative and overstimulating. But Reich saw the problem asstemming less from his “precocious sexuality”than from its context, the repressive andsex-negative atmosphere of his father’s house.If his desire as a child to witness forbidden things had led to such devastatingconsequences, it also led to a characteristic that became one of his chief virtues in adultlife: his ability to see beneath the surface or “clothing” of things, to explore what the gen-eral consensus deemed “offlimits.”By the late 1920s, Reich was struggling to maintain his own line of thought andinvestigation against considerable criticism. As we shall see in the next chapter, many ofhis analytic colleagues became hostile to his sex-political work. Characteristically, Reichreacted strongly. If his colleagues disliked the affirmation of adolescent and childhoodheterosexuality,let them think about nudity between parents and children; let them con-sider the rational arguments for preventing children from witnessing parental intercourse.Myron SharafFury On Earth136éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"After the heat of battle, Reich was better placed emotionally to qualify his views and totake into account some of the criticisms of his opponents. Thus, after 1935 or so, Reichstressed once again that adults could be destructively provocative as well as suppressivein dealing with children.Persons critical of permissive attitudes toward the sexual life of children andadolescents often charged that such attitudes would undermine marriage and the family.The reaction of many liberal sex reformers was to attempt to reassure these critics. Eventoday, the American organization SIECUS (Sex Information and Educational Council ofthe United States) argues that sexual enlightenment will improve marriage. Dr. MaryCalderone, the leading spokesperson for the organization, makes a point of not advocat-ing premarital intercourse22.Reich, of course, was scornful of such evasion. He agreed in part with his con-servative critics; the affirmation of childhood and adolescent sexuality would indeedundermine the institution of marriage in the sense of the traditional concept of marriageor what he termed “life-long, compulsive monogamy.”23Conversely, the denial of sex-uality in childhood and adolescence prepared the way for this kind of marriage preciselybecause it helped to flatten the emotional vitality of people, thereby making them moreresigned to a dull relationship. At the same time, Reich emphasized—as his critics didnot—that such an upbringing also destroyed marriage, robbing it of its joys and con-tributing to myriad marital problems.What did Reich foresee as replacing the institution of “life-long, compulsivemonogamy”? He disagreed with many conservative critics of sex reform who claimedthat promiscuity in adulthood resulted from the relaxation of “proper” sexual standardsin childhood and adolescence. In his view, traditional marriage would be replaced bysomething like what in fact seems to be happening today—serial monogamy. Reichtermed this kind of marriage “the lasting love relationship,” and saw the capacity for itas the hallmark ofthe healthy adult24.The “lasting love relationship” also had a strongcomponent oftenderness, based in part on gratitude for sexual pleasure in the past andanticipation ofpleasure in the future.Reich sharply distinguished this kind of tendernessfrom the sticky, clinging affection often shown between spouses in compulsivemonogamy. In the latter instance, frequent “honeys” or “dears” cannot conceal an under-lying sense offrustration and rage.Why did the ties that make the healthy love relationship lasting not also make itpermanent and exclusive? For several reasons: first, the interests of the two partnersmight diverge over time. The couple who entered a relationship in their twenties mightbe quite different people in their thirties. More importantly, Reich coined the term “sex-ual dulling”to describe what happened over time between even the most passionate cou-ple.He viewed “sexual dulling” as the inevitable result of close physical proximity to onepartner, and the simultaneous exposure to new sexual stimuli emanating from others.When the relationship between two people is at its height, the desire for others has littleeffect.The healthier the individual, the more conscious is the attraction to others and11 : The Application of Sex-economic Concepts on the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930137éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"hence the easier to control, so long as the original relationship is basically satisfying andthe desire for others not too strong.Several factors ensue from this “sexual dulling,” which make it extremely diffi-cult to deal with. The dulling may occur in one partner and not the other. If the partnerwhose interest has flagged enters another relationship, the still attached partner mayexperience acute jealousy. Reich did not agree with some extreme radicals who dismissedall jealousy as a sign of neurosis, but. he did distinguish between normal jealousy andpossessiveness. In the presence of the former, the painful feelings created by one’s part-ner having an affair with another can be worked through and mastered.Reich made a point of characterizing the “love relationship” in terms of its qual-ity rather than its length. It might last for months, a few years, or many years; but thequalities of sharing, tenderness, and development over time distinguished it from a morepurely sensual temporary relationship. It was not monogamous in the sense that theremight be experimental affairs, especially during periods of sexual dulling with the origi-nal partner.Reich stressed that this kind of solution to the problem of dulling the experi-mental affair, the openness of the ultimate solution—required personality structures andsocial conditions that applied only to a minuscule minority ofthe population. Social-eco-nomic factors also militated against the kind of solutions he proposed. The economicdependence prevalent for so long often made it difficult for a woman to leave a relation-ship. Throughout his adult life, Reich adamantly opposed such economic dependence forwomen. He strongly believed that women should have their own careers and managetheir own finances. In this way, the link between love and economic need could be bro-ken: people could stay together because they chose to, not because they were forced todo so. If they separated and there were children from the relationship, each should con-tribute to child support.During the late 1920s,Reich was as concerned with the economic dependenceof women as he was with a variety of other “patriarchal” attitudes. In particular, heinveighed against the sexual double standard that permitted male youth to sow wild oatsyet punished “bad girls” who did the same; against the notion that women were “natu-rally”passive sexually; against “machismo” attitudes that regarded male infidelity assomething the woman should tolerate but female infidelity a terrible blow to the man’spride; and against education for the supremacy of man which makes fully mutual mentalcompanionship with the woman impossible25.Reich also called attention to the way in which traditional marriage, while pro-viding support and protection for women and children, also exploited the woman. Shewas not only the sexual object of the man but her unpaid work in the household indi-rectly increased the profit of the employer. The man could work at low wages becausewomen did work in the home without pay. If the wife was also employed, she had towork overtime, without pay, to keep her home in order.Reich’s position on the raising of children varied. In the late 1920s and earlyMyron SharafFury On Earth138éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"1930s, he stressed the importance of social care and communal upbringing for children,though he never went into detail as to how this should be arranged or its combinationwith parental involvement. He sometimes called for increased but limited state participa-tion in child rearing, through laws concerning maternity leave, child support, and the pro-vision of day-care facilities. At other times he called for something like the abolition ofthe family:The prevention of neuroses is inconceivable as long as there continues to befamily upbringing and, with it, Oedipal conflicts. We regret, of course, the com-plexity of this problem, but it cannot be helped: the prevention of neurosesbegins by excluding from the education of the child his or her own parents, whohave proven themselves to be the most unqualified educators. The sexual educa-tion of the small child will be put instead into the hands of specially trained per-sonnel who will be less biased. This, however, presupposes the education ofsociety in general26.By 1935 or so, Reich was no longer speaking of “excluding” the parents fromtheir children’s education. He continued to emphasize the need for social support and aninvolvement in their upbringing far beyond the existing structure. But over the years hemade much more of the contrast between the “natural family” and the “compulsive fam-ily” than he did of the contrast between the family as educator and the state as educator.The “natural family” was nothing more (or less) than the “lasting love relationship,”where the partners had children and were responsible for them in some not too clearcombination with social facilities such as day-care centers.However, the fate of the children, if the relationship between the parents dis-solved, was a question Reich never discussed in detail. And, as we shall see subsequent-ly, his relationship with his own children after his marriage with Annie dissolved was asource ofgreat anguish to him.It is interesting to speculate why Reich maintained for a period so extreme, sodubious a view as the exclusion of parents from the education of their own children. Itwould seem,again, as if the pressures from his own unhappy childhood and from hisincreasingly unhappy marriage in the late 1920s contributed to his bold formulation: abo-lition ofthe family.The question arises: How original were Reich’s concepts concerning the affirma-tion of genital love life for adults, adolescents, and children? Certainly many aspects ofhis criticism ofBabbitt-like marriage, of attitudes toward women, of repressive laws con-cerning marriage, divorce, contraception, abortion, premarital and extramarital sexuality,were very much “in the air” and part of the intellectual climate in progressive Europeancircles. Havelock Ellis, Bertrand Russell, Max Hodann, Ellen Key, Fritz Brupbacher,Helena Stocker,and a host ofothers were fighting for a revision of conventional sexualmores at the time.11 : The Application of Sex-economic Concepts on the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930139éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Reich was clearly influenced by the liberal policy of the Soviet Union towardsexual issues. He had read much about what was going on in the “first socialist society.”Then, in the summer of 1929, he and Annie visited Russia for a few weeks, where Reichgave some lectures. He came back more convinced than ever that sexual misery and eco-nomic exploitation were inextricably linked and that a solution to the sexual questioncould not take place without a social revolution. His trip also convinced him that certainmeasures then being taken in the Soviet Union—simple divorce, legalized abortion,attempts to break down the economic dependence of women, and some sexually permis-sive “children’s collectives” (especially the one run by the psychoanalytically orientededucator Vera Schmidt)—were only possible in a Communist society. He noted the signsindicating that by 1929 the Soviet Union was already beginning to retreat from this kindof revolutionary policy, although formal reactionary measures would not fully emergeuntil the 1930s.Even more important was the influence of Marx on Reich’s thinking. FromFreud, Reich had received the beginnings of a truly dynamic psychology of individualdevelopment within one particular form of family life—the nuclear, patriarchal family.For Marx, family form was itself dependent upon socioeconomic conditions, which werein a process ofcontinuous change based on the class struggle. Marx and Engels at timeshad spoken of the “abolition of the family” under communism, but they had no clearsexual theory. Still, their prediction of “unalienated” Communist men and women fulfill-ing all their potentialities without economic or sexist exploitation was undoubtedly animportant influence on Reich’s own social vision.I would like to note here that my method of presenting different aspects ofReich’s work in separate chapters has the disadvantage of obscuring just how much Reichwas involved with at any given time. Thus, from 1927 until 1934, Reich was pursuing hischaracter-analytic studies with even greater vigor than in preceding years (Chapter 14).He also devoted considerable time and energy to his practical sex-politics (this chapterand Chapter 13). Finally, he was making a major conceptual effort to integrate Freud andMarx,to bring social theory to Freud’s work on the individual and a dynamic psycholo-gy to Marxist theory and practice27. In recalling her association with Reich, GreteBibring shook her head and said that Reich’s evening technical seminar would often lastuntil one in the morning. Frequently she was tired and would have liked to stop earlier,“but no work was too much for Willy.”Reich was more original in his clear-cut affirmation of adolescent and child gen-itality. However, what really distinguished his position was not the advocacy of one oranother specific viewpoint:it was the way he formulated a syndrome of concepts. In thissense, Reich’s contribution in the social field was similar to his clinical contribution. Inhis character-analytic work he wove together existing concepts such as latent negativetransference, defensive character traits, nonverbal communication, and “actual neuroses.”These linkages ofexisting clinical concepts were made in the service of a new therapeu-tic goal—the establishment of orgastic potency.Myron SharafFury On Earth140éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Similarly, in his social concepts Reich interwove a series of affirmations of gen-ital life, connecting them with a psychiatric theory that provided distinctions many liber-tarians were unable to perceive. That is, it made all the difference in the world not justwhether the child masturbated, but whether the masturbation was motivated by genitalpleasure or as a means of discharging anger and anxiety. It made all the difference in theworld whether a person, in rejecting compulsive monogamy, moved on to a “lasting loverelationship” or, incapable of that kind of closeness, was promiscuous. Without suchprecise distinctions, conservatives could cite (as they still do) the unhappily masturbatingchild or the compulsively driven Don Juan as proof that the “living out” of sexualimpulses led to misery and chaos.As usual, Reich sought support for his social concepts just as he had for his clin-ical ones. Yet his sex-political work aroused considerable opposition, especially amongpsychoanalytic colleagues. And it contributed to the deterioration of his marriage toAnnie.11 : The Application of Sex-economic Concepts on the Social Scene The Sex-pol: 1927-1930141éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"12 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1927-1930When Reich was reunited with his family after his stay in Davos, he was intent uponsaving his marriage. Yet new strains appeared in his complex relationship with Annie. Forone thing, after the incidents of July 15, 1927, direct contact with the poor and unemployedheightened his sense of guilt about his own economically privileged position, a guilt he par-tially assuaged by contributing money to the Communist Party, to the “left opposition” with-in the Social Democratic Party, and to his sex-political efforts1. In addition, he gave moneydirectly to fund-raising efforts for the unemployed.These heavy financial commitments led to friction with Annie, who, while not hos-tile, was by no means passionately devoted to his political causes. She participated by work-ing as a psychoanalyst at his counseling centers, but without the genuine enthusiasm shebrought to her private practice. There were quarrels between the two of them about house-hold expenses. From the beginning of their marriage, Reich was determined that each wouldbe economically independent. However, according to Annie, Reich was often insufficientlyaware of or concerned about the difficulties in the way of her contributing financially, espe-cially when she was pregnant or had a small baby to care for.Then, after the Vienna uprising, Reich’s relentless concern for raising moneyclashed with Annie’s interest in continuing their comfortable life together. There were quar-rels as to whether money should be spent for new curtains or pamphlets on sex informa-tion. Annie’s father, Alfred Pink, seems to have helped out financially. Most of the time,Annie herselfwas earning a good income so that,to some extent at least, both curtains andpamphlets were feasible.From his side, by 1927, Reich was determined more than ever to live that heroicexistence he had envisioned in the Army and feared would be undermined in the trivialitiesof peacetime. Money and its disposition was always one of the chief battlegrounds onwhich Reich fought out his war against the quotidian.But, I believe, the financial arguments were symptoms of a deeper disturbance onReich’s part. So long as he was involved with more traditional aspects of psychoanalysis,such as the impulsive character, the relationship with Annie seems to have been fairly stable.However, the more his own direction became manifest, as in his clinical work on the func-tion of the orgasm and in his sex-politics, the worse the relationship between them became.Reich expected a full response to and affirmation of his work from his mates; he had doneso with Lia in the medical school days and would do so again later in other relationships.When that support was lacking, he became angry and embittered.Myron SharafFury On Earth142éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"A further complicating factor was the entanglement of analytic relationships.Around 1928, Annie went into analysis with Anna Freud, at that time a young analyst. MissFreud attended Reich’s technical seminar and had a high regard for his contributions to ana-lytic theory and technique. However, she had a much more conservative sexual orientationthan Reich, and he feared that she might influence Annie against his work. There is no evi-dence that he ever opposed the analysis, but he was not happy about it2.Another source of friction was the fact that in 1927 Reich again began to see agood deal of Lia Laszky, who was now divorced. Laszky was very much involved in thestudy of psychoanalysis, but, unlike Annie, she had an intense commitment to radical poli-tics. Indeed, she had joined the Communist Party earlier than Reich. Her life crossed his atstill another point: she taught at the Montessori nursery school attended by the three-year-old Eva.Reich found the vivacious Laszky a stimulating companion with whom to share hissex-political work as well as his clinical writings. In addition, Lia Laszky had become a beau-tiful, mature woman with considerable piquancy. Given his marital difficulties, includingAnnie’s ambivalence and attitude toward his work, he was very receptive to Lia’s sexualcharms. On her side, Lia found the vibrant thirty-year-old Willy a much more secure personthan the volatile youth she had known in medical school. His stature as an analyst, combinedwith his political radicalism, exerted a strong appeal. Finally, she was much less the reluctantvirgin she had been in medical school, although Reich remained the pursuer in the develop-ing relationship.Their affair seems to have been more than casual but less than deeply involved.Each was very busy and their times spent together, aside from work, were sporadic. Therewas no talk of marriage. As Laszky’s interest in Reich’s social work waned during 1929, sodid their sexual relationship. It ended cleanly, and they remained good friends for years after.Unlike so many others, Lia Laszky never blamed Reich for either their personal or profes-sional involvements. For a time she had been excited by him and by sex-politics; and thatwas that.She also tended to look back on both the affair and her work participation as some-what illicit:the first violated her feelings for Annie Reich, the second her lifelong commit-ment to psychoanalysis3.On Reich’s side, the feelings may well have run deeper. Reich slept with manywomen, but Lia was one of the few he would mention frequently and warmly long after theliaison had ended.It says a good deal that when he was isolated in Rangeley, Maine, in the19505, (see Chapter 30), under attack from all sides and seeing only those who were “in thework,”he permitted Laszky to visit and give him some frank advice “out of our old friend-ship,” in her own words. For a period in the 1920s, Lia Laszky, with her interests, her verve,and her candor, had been able to embody a sexual-emotional-intellectual excitement forReich that complemented his enthusiasm for Marxism, sex-politics, and “the function of theorgasm”—the book of that title published in the same year his affair with Lia began.Exactly how Annie felt about the affair we do not know. Ottilie, Robert’s widow,who lived with the Reichs from September 1926 to June 1927, felt that Annie “shut her12 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1927-1930143éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"eyes” to the relationship4. However, it cannot have been easy for her to know that Reichwas involved with a woman who was also her friend. Annie appears to have had the habitof blunting her own anger, but presenting her situation in a way that stirred up the anger ofothers on her behalf5.Reich was also having trouble with analytic colleagues. Many had regarded him asintense and “fanatical” even beforehis radical political involvement. After it, the numberwho took this view sharply increased. Richard Sterba, Reich’s friend during the early andmid-twenties, found that after 1927 Reich was far more “belligerent” than he had been ear-lier. The two men argued about Reich’s professional direction until an increasing coldnessset in between them and there was little further contact6.Reich had always shown a tendency to meet opposition with indignation and bel-ligerence. This disposition undoubtedly contributed to the growing conviction on the partof many analysts that from 1927 on, Reich exhibited “paranoid” trends. At least, Sterba,Grete Bibring, and—in retrospect—Annie Reich felt that this was the period when Reich“changed.”Other observers felt differently. Lia did not perceive the Reich of the late 1920s as“paranoid”; on the contrary, she described a much less “touchy” person than the youth sheknew at medical school. Yet her description has one element in common with those moreantagonistic to Reich. When criticized, she said, Reich in certain moods “could take any-thing” with equanimity. But in other moods he could take nothing without flaring up.If some of his colleagues found Reich belligerent, he found many of them infuri-atingly remote from the turmoil of the times. If they found him fanatical, he saw them aslacking either conviction or the capacity to apply their psychoanalytic knowledge to thesocial scene.Reich could still be a delightful companion,participating in a variety of social gath-erings. Ottilie has described how sparkling and winning he could be at parties: “I never knewanyone who could be so seductive—not sexually seductive, but charming. That smile!”However, increasingly the social evenings were mixed with work discussions. As GreteBibring put it,“One could not be around Reich long without the discussion turning towork.” Bibring interpreted it as another sign of Reich’s taking himself too seriously when in1928 he sent her a photo of himself at his desk with an inscription on the back: “Theresearcher at work.”Reich experienced the same mixed attitudes from his colleagues that he had expe-rienced earlier, only now in more intensified form. Most of his associates liked his work oncharacter defenses but disliked his views on genitality. By 1927, his sex-political work com-bined with his ardent Marxism added to the widespread criticism that he was advocating a“genital Utopia.” It should also be stressed that in the 1920s psychoanalysis as a professionwas entering a more respectable and settled phase. With his affirmation—among otherthings—of adolescent and childhood sexuality, Reich threatened to provoke anew the angerofsociety.IfReich found many of his colleagues turning against him, he received a warmerMyron SharafFury On Earth144éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"response from the poor, who had to deal with the harsh economic reality of post-imperialVienna of the late 1920s, and he felt more at home among them. There is a fascinating pic-ture taken of Reich in 1927 or 1928 that highlights his increasing identification with theworking class. The photo shows him standing with a group of twenty or so other people infront of a building with signs posted up saying: “Mit den Kommunisten gegen dieFaschisten” (With the Communists against the Fascists) and “Wahlt Kommunisten!” (VoteCommunist!). Reich stands at the edge of the group, wearing a tie but also a leather jacket,a frequent part of his dress during this period. The picture is in sharp contrast to photostaken of Reich with his analytic colleagues. The latter, in other photos, are clearly middleclass and professional, and dressed accordingly. In the political photo Reich is with simplepeople, some of the working class, all very nonacademic in appearance. There is a man insome kind of uniform standing in the front of the group, straddling a bicycle. A boy in aknit cap watches the scene. The photo is haunting, bringing to mind the Depression years,the rise of fascism, and the searing political struggles of the late 1920s and early 1930s.In these years Reich was still trying to combine different milieus—the world of thepoor and the world of his professional colleagues, the world of marriage and the world ofhis political relationships. Ottilie, for example, recalled Reich reading to her one night fromsomething he had just written:“He was so warm,so full ofcompassion for people that Iloved him at that moment. And then the next day he could be cold and callous to the peo-ple around him.” She also contrasted the different ways he could look his dark brown eyessparkling with that “wonderful smile” when he was happy, then the angry look, when hiseyes became smaller, his mouth tightened, and the redness of his skin was accentuated.Ottilie also described a trait of Reich’s that was a characteristic throughout his life.At times he could exert a heavy-handed pressure on people around him, not only to followhis work but also to be guided by him in personal matters. For example, after Robert’s deathOttilie was not interested in other men for some time. Reich frequently urged her to have asexual relationship, to overcome her “genital anxiety.” He also diagnosed her as having a“martyr complex.” He combined these two notions into an informal “character analysis,”which Ottilie sometimes found helpful,at other times very annoying. When she expressedher irritation, Reich apologized and stopped.Reich’s diagnosing ofOttilie is a good example of how he interwove professionaland personal concerns. The same kind of interlacing was apparent in his relations with hischildren. Both in his writings and in his rearing of Lore, Reich began to emphasize “self-reg-ulation”for anal as well as genital life. He no longer feared that an absence of strictnesswould lead to a fixation through over-indulgence. Rather, there was a maturational progresstoward the genital stage, just as there was a natural progression from sitting to walking.However, it was not until some years later that Reich would stress the negative consequencesof a strict feeding schedule during the oral phase of development.Reich’s upbringing of his daughters was most influenced by his concepts concern-ing genitality.Eva was early told the “facts of life,” and as a youngster of four or five (in1928 or 1929) she took some pride in the fact that older children would come to her for sex12 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1927-1930145éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"information. Probably under Reich’s influence, Annie kept a diary of Eva’s sex education.The parents seem to have shared a concern about finding ways to enlighten their childrenwithout being “seductive.”It should not be construed that the children’s sexual education occurred in a cold,intellectual atmosphere. On the contrary, Reich was sometimes criticized for being overlyaffectionate with Eva. (Eva seems always to have been his favorite. Lore’s birth in 1928 tookplace as the relationship between Reich and Annie was deteriorating.) Lia Laszky recalls leav-ing her son Tony, then three or four, with the Reichs for a week or so while she took a vaca-tion. Visiting briefly at the Reichs’ summer home, she commented to Reich that he cuddledwith Eva too much; it would prevent her from having a good relationship later with a man.Reich became annoyed. Laszky reminded him that she was his expert on children so heshould listen to her. He replied that she wasn’t the expert on raising his children.On a theoretical level, Reich believed in the affirmation of genital play among peersduring childhood. And he was curious as to what such play was like in the “natural” situa-tion. Just how curious is well illustrated by a story Ottilie relates. Tony had come over to playwith Eva. At nap time, Eva and Tony undressed and lay down to rest. Ottilie reports thatReich watched them through the keyhole. He told Ottilie that he was interested in notingwho took the initiative for sexual play—the boy or the girl. Although he invited her toobserve, Ottilie was not interested. She was amused at Reich’s disappointment when the chil-dren just giggled and then fell asleep.Ottilie related this story in a way which suggested that, in her opinion, Reichbehaved quite foolishly. From one viewpoint, he did. One can also read into the incident, Ithink justly, an obsessive curiosity about his children’s sex lives, a theme to be repeated manyyears later with his only son, Peter, born in 1944. One might see in it, too, the same voyeuris-tic trait that had led Reich to observe his mother and tutor.Over and beyond Reich’s psychodynamics, the incident is a nice illustration ofReich’s commitment to the study ofgenitality, his interweaving of the personal with the sci-entific, and his method of naturalistic “field research.” As a researcher, he preferred toobserve phenomena in vivo.If the observation of childhood genitality without altering thephenomena required looking through a keyhole, so be it.Whatever Ottilie’s impatience with Reich’s insistence on genitality, it did not impairtheir good relationship. What did lead to its disruption had to do with money.Ottilie left the Reich home in 1927, after completing her training as a nursery-school teacher. She was now in a position to support herself and her child, and was alsoeager to leave because she disliked Reich’s affairs, his periodic coldness toward Annie, andhis occasional cuttingly critical remarks,which could demolish Annie or any other targetaround him.In 1929, Ottilie turned to Reich for help, this time for his maternal grandmother.Grandmother Roniger was a person Reich never liked: he considered her vain and meddle-some7.However, both she and her wealthy brother Josef Blum, for whom she kept house,had been bankrupted in the severe Depression of 1929. Josef was accepted into one of theMyron SharafFury On Earth146éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"B’nai Brith homes for the elderly, but Josephine had no such recourse. Ottilie asked Reichfor a contribution to the relatives’ fund so that his grandmother would not have to dependon public charity. Ottilie became incensed when Reich not only refused help but couched hisrefusal in callous terms. He said his grandmother could live in a poorhouse as far as he wasconcerned. He would have been happy to help support the old family cook, a workingwoman, but he would not give a penny to help such a “meddlesome parasite” as Josephine.Ottilie appealed again on the grounds of his contributing in memory of his mother, but tono avail.Immensely upset, Ottilie vowed never to see him again. Four years later, Reich hadto flee Berlin when Hitler came to power in March 1933. While passing through Vienna, hegot in touch with Ottilie. She agreed to see him and they had a generally cordial meeting.She told him his grandmother had died in the intervening years, and that she had not had tolive out the remainder of her life in a poorhouse. Ottilie’s relatives had managed to supporther without her ever knowing that she was dependent on the generosity of others. WhenReich heard the story, he shook his head and said: “Sentimental fools!” Ottilie replied: “Wemay have been sentimental fools but you are a pig so it’s a good combination.” Not longafter this meeting, Reich gave her a copy of his new book,The Mass Psychology of Fascism, withthe inscription:“To my beloved sister-in-law.”8Why did Ottilie remain angry with Reich over a period of years? There seems tohave been something more at work in the intensity of her reactions than the particular inci-dents she cites. Yet Reich was to be accused many times of breaking off relations with peo-ple he knew well. The completeness of their rupture was also so characteristic of Reich’spersonal relations that I shall postpone a fuller analysis until later; but two aspects deservesome discussion here.The first concerns the way Reich insisted on making a principle out of what othersconsidered a “failing.” To have an affair was one thing; to make a principle of it another. Notto help out a relative was one thing; to assert that it would be wrong to help a “parasite,”that one’s money was better spent elsewhere, was different. Then there was Reich’s angertoward the target of his disapproval. Not only did the grandmother not deserve his support;she merited the “poorhouse.”The second factor,associated with the first, concerns the lack of empathy most ofReich’s friends felt for his principles, or what he called the “red line” of his life and work.Even when,like Ottilie, they did not actively oppose his interests, they often felt he madetoo much of them. This, in turn, made them less sympathetic to the ways he implementedhis “mission” and the people he hurt along the route.Reich himselfwas not always aware of just how limited was the support he receivedfor his concepts. In his polarizing way, he tended to regard his associates as either against hiswork or for it. He was usually right about those he labeled against it. Analysts like PaulFedern, in fact, thoroughly opposed him. However, his friends often liked him and evenparts ofhis work,without fully sharing in what he regarded as his central concerns.Lia Laszky, for example, participated closely in Reich’s sex-political work. Yet, in12 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1927-1930147éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"addition to doubting how much sex education and counseling would influence the massespolitically, she was far from committed to the affirmation of childhood and adolescent gen-itality. Undoubtedly, Reich’s personal influence, his charisma, and the desire of those closeto him to win his approval pushed some of them to go along with his work more than theyactually believed in it. Edith Buxbaum, one of Annie’s university friends, participated inReich’s sex-counseling centers; she also tried to “enlighten” the students at the high schoolwhere she taught, an effort not appreciated by the school officials.In looking back on her relationship with Reich, Buxbaum underscored his person-al influence on her and her admiration of him as a brilliant young analyst and as first thelover, then the husband, of her closest friend. She also stressed how much she learned byattending his technical seminar and being supervised by him. However, she looked back onher sex-political activity as foolishness done under Reich’s influence9.Even the “younger generation” of analysts and analytic candidates, whom Reichviewed as sympathetic in contrast to the older, more hostile analysts, went only a part of theway with him and seldom on the aspects he valued most: his clinical concept of orgasticpotency and his social, mass-psychological work. Richard Sterba and Grete Bibring, bothvery positive members of the technical seminar, were after 1927 joining those like HelenaDeutsch who had early regarded Reich as a “fanatic,” although they still considered him anexcellent analyst and teacher.Many of the personal characteristics mentioned—Reich’s principles that violatedthe general consensus, his passionate determination to live by those principles, his tendencyto badger others into following his beliefs, his polarization of colleagues, his blindness tofriends’ criticism unless such criticism was clearly stated remind us of intellectual adoles-cents. So, too, does Reich’s desire to work in a variety of fields and not “settle down” to onething.Goethe has said that the genius periodically re-experiences all the expansion ofadolescence, the excitement of new intense emotions, concepts, and creations. What theadolescent—or genius—discovers seems so self-evident,so important, and so enchantingthat he or she cannot believe others will not share the excitement once they are exposed toit.The difference between the truly creative adult and the adolescent is that the for-mer is repeatedly able to channel his or her excitement into enduring accomplishments,however many realms of creation are involved. However, it often takes time for the creator’sdiscoveries to be seen in their fullness. Meanwhile it is the adolescent aspects of the person-ality—the storms and demands rather than the achievements—that most impress anddepress his or her family and friends.In September 1930, Reich decided to move from Vienna to Berlin. Despite his mar-ital difficulties and the worsening of his collegial relationships, it is my guess that Reichmight well have remained in Vienna had it not been for two factors: Freud’s attitude towardhis sex-political work and his own conflict with the Social Democratic Party.Myron SharafFury On Earth148éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"When Reich began his sex-political counseling, he felt he had Freud’s support.Freud was generally encouraging toward diverse enterprises along analytic lines even whenhe was not fully in agreement with them. And, to some extent, he was in sympathy withReich’s direction, Freud had long been concerned with finding ways to bring psychoanalyt-ic knowledge to a broader public than could be reached through individual treatment.Furthermore, Reich’s sex-politics reflected Freud’s early interest in the treatment of the actu-al neuroses.In addition, Reich’s critique of conventional sexual morality was not without reso-nances in Freud’s work. To give but one example, Freud had commented early on the preva-lence of sexual unhappiness in marriage: “The uninitiated can hardly believe how rarely nor-mal sexual potency is to be found in the man, and how often frigidity in the woman, amongthose married couples living under the sway of our civilized sexual morality: what a degreeof renunciation is associated often for both partners with marriage, and of how little themarriage comes to consist of bringing the happiness that was so ardently desired.”10Freud also shared with Reich the hope that the Soviet Union’s experiment in relax-ing divorce laws and other measures of sexual liberation would be successful11. Still, evenhere Freud was hesitant, fearing that too great a liberalization would lead to social chaos. Forhe held the belief that considerable frustration of the sexual impulse was necessary for civ-ilization.In short, whatever support Freud gave to Reich was always qualified. As Reich con-tinued to insist on drawing social consequences from psychoanalytic findings, Freud’s cool-ness increased. In a private conversation in 1929, when Reich discussed the problem ofcompulsive monogamy, Freud remarked that if Reich pursued this line, he would be provok-ing a good deal oftrouble12.The most extensive information on Freud’s reaction to Reich’s social views comesfrom an evening meeting on December 12, 1929, held at Freud’s home. This particular ses-sion was one ofa series ofregular monthly meetings attended by the inner circle ofViennese analysts, including such persons as Paul Federn, Hermann Nunberg, Felix andHelena Deutsch,Heinz Hartmann,and Ludwig Jekels, in addition to Freud and Reich. Guestmembers also came to particular meetings.In his presentation that evening, Reich outlined his views (summarized in Chapter11) on the need for sweeping changes in man’s sexual and economic life in order to preventan “epidemic” of neuroses. In the ensuing discussion and at subsequent meetings, Freudanswered with the arguments later to be published in his Civilization and Its Discontents:There can be no doubt about its purpose [the purpose of the pleasure principle],and yet its program is in conflict with the whole world, with the macrocosm as withthe microcosm.It simply cannot be put into execution: the whole constitution ofthings runs counter to it. One might say that the intention that man should be“happy” is not included in the “scheme of Creation.” What is called happiness inits narrowest sense comes from the gratification—most often instantaneous—of12 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1927-1930149éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"highly pent-up needs, and by its very nature can only be a transitory experience... .Civilization is built on renunciation of instinctual gratifications... . This “cultural”privation dominates the whole field of social relations between human beings... .Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primaryhostility of men toward one another... . Hence its system of methods by whichmankind is to be driven to identification and aim-inhibited love relationships; hencethe restrictions on sexual life13.In commenting upon the meeting of December 12, Reich mentioned that theatmosphere was “very cold.” Here he was referring to the other analysts present. As forFreud, he was strict with Reich but it was a kind of strictness Reich could take without hisusual sensitivity14.The most specific example of this hardness was reported not by Reich but byRichard Sterba, a guest at the meeting. I have already referred to his quote in connectionwith Reich’s clinical concept of orgastic potency; the particular context was Freud’s criticismof Reich’s social concepts (see page 100). According to Sterba, Freud commented that“complete orgasm” was not the total answer. There was no single cause for the neuroses.When Reich kept arguing for his own viewpoint, Freud replied sharply: “He who wants tohave the floor again and again shows that he wants to be right at any price.”15According to Reich, his most acrimonious discussion with Freud occurred inSeptember 1930 just before his move to Berlin. Reich visited Freud at Grundlsee, theAustrian village where Freud spent his summer vacations. They continued their debate aboutthe family problem. Reich had argued that one had to make a distinction between the gen-uinely loving family and the family bound together by guilt or obligation16.This account,of course, reflects Reich’s memory of the conversation twenty-threeyears after it occurred.Given the context of 1930, it is quite possible that Reich stated hisposition in a more extreme fashion. It was around this time, in his talk before the WorldLeague for Sexual Reform, that he had spoken of the need to remove children from the fam-ily setting,if the Oedipus complex and neuroses were to be prevented (see page XXX,chap. 11).In any case, whether he stated his views in their more moderate or in extreme form,Freud did not agree. He had replied that Reich’s viewpoint had little to do with the moder-ate stance of psychoanalysis. Reich had answered that he regretted the disagreement but hehad to maintain his position17.Reich clearly remembered Freud’s final comment to the effect that it was notFreud’s intention or the intention of psychoanalysis to cure the world of its ills, in whichFreud was referring indirectly to Reich’s social ambitiousness, his need to “rescue” the world.Reich remembered clearly his last impression of Freud. As he left, he gazed back atFreud’s house and saw Freud in his room pacing to and fro. The image of Freud as a “cagedanimal” lingered in his mind18.In spite of the sharpness of the exchanges between the two men, there was justifi-Myron SharafFury On Earth150éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"cation for Reich’s view that Freud still thought well of him while others were pressuringFreud to take a more negative stance. For example, in 1928, Reich’s old enemy Paul Federnwanted to have Reich removed as director of the technical seminar, ostensibly on thegrounds that Reich was so busy. On November 22, 1928, Freud wrote Federn:When you spoke to me the day before yesterday about relieving Dr. Reich of theleadership of the seminar, I thought k would probably be desirable to him, too,since he is so busy with other activities. I hoped in this way to meet both your wish-es. It seems, however, I erred [about Reich’s feelings]; and so you will have to relin-quish your wish because I do not want to give the impression of a punitive dis-missal of Reich without his consent and through an order I do not desire to issueand for which there is no reason. The criticisms which you and other colleaguesraised about him are balanced by his great merits to the intellectual life of theAssociation. He is really quite good. I have to ask you to maintain a collegial rela-tionship with him. If he wants to keep the seminar leadership, we have to grant himthis19.It also appears that when Reich decided to leave for Berlin, he was not certain howpermanent the move would be; yet Federn used the opportunity to remove Reich from lead-ership of the technical seminar and from membership in the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society.In some distress, Reich wrote to Freud about this. Freud in turn wrote to Federn on October10, 1930. He reported that he had answered Reich’s complaint by saying, “... we promisedhim that he could keep his positions [should he decide to return] and that we wished to holdto that agreement, but we did not have any understanding about the way a temporary leavewould be handled.” After making the point, Freud added a qualification: “Of course, youcould have done it differently. First, Dr. Reich could have been elected, and then he couldhave asked for a temporary leave.” Freud then went on to repeat that they intended to rein-state Reich should he return to Vienna, followed by another qualification—“if he has notbecome impossible.” By “impossible,” Freud was undoubtedly referring to the degree ofaggressiveness Reich might bring to his presentation of the proper clinical and social goalsofpsychoanalysis.One final point about the connection between Reich’s relationship with Freud andthe move to Berlin should be made. At their last meeting in the country, Reich had suggest-ed that as a check on any irrational element in his social position he might consult with someanalyst in Berlin. Freud had replied that it would be hard for so eminent an analyst as Reichto find a suitable therapist. Nonetheless, Freud suggested Sandor Rado or SiegfriedBernfeld20.It would not have been easy for Reich to consider having more analysis, given hisfeelings of rejection about Freud’s earlier refusal to accept him as a patient. However, itwould have been far more difficult for him to see a Viennese analyst than someone in Berlin.In Vienna the relationships had become so entwined over the years, the various competi-12 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1927-1930151éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"tions and dissensions so great as to preclude Reich’s establishing a viable therapeutic alliancewith any analyst other than Freud.Reich’s political difficulties proved even greater than his psychoanalytic ones.Austria was undergoing a severe depression and by the fall of 1929 the political situation inVienna had deteriorated sharply. The Heimwehr was showing increased recklessness, attack-ing Social Democratic workers’ homes and meetings. The Christian Socialists were demand-ing emergency powers for the national leadership, powers that would curtail civil libertiesand require constitutional changes. Fearful of even worse consequences, the SocialDemocratic leadership was negotiating compromises with the Christian Socialists.The Communists and the left wing of the Social Democratic Party were outragedby such compromises. Reich organized the Komitee Revolutionar Sozialdemokraten(Committee of Revolutionary Social Democrats) to oppose the party on the constitutionalissue21. This committee had a small core often members, some of whom Reich had metthrough his clinics. He financed the group’s activities, which included the brief publicationof a newspaper.The first public meeting sponsored by the committee took place on the night ofDecember 13, 1929. (It is striking that this meeting occurred only one day after the discus-sion at Freud’s home on the prevention of the neuroses.) Reich gave the main speech,sharply criticizing the Social Democratic leaders for making militant press statements andsimultaneously behaving so cautiously toward the Christian Socialist government. Worse,they had tried to gag party members who opposed this vacillating policy. Reich concludedby calling for the mobilization of the working class, for their taking the offensive against theHeimwehr and the Christian Socialists. Anson Rabinbach summarizes: “By openly con-fronting the leadership with almost no support in the party except among certain discon-tented elements among the youth and the Schutzbund, Reich clearly put himself in a posi-tion that courted expulsion.”Reich was, in fact, expelled from the party on January 16, 1930. He was accused ofviolating party discipline by attacking the leadership and by working closely with theCommunists.The main witnesses against Reich were two associates from the committee.They claimed they did not know that Communists were going to attend the December 13rally.One of them said that he had visited Reich’s clinic after years of unemployment andwas vulnerable to Reich’s “seductive influences.” The two men were permitted to remain inthe party because oftheir testimony against Reich and for having seen the error of theirways.Reich’s account of the period in People in Troublein no way contradicts Rabinbachbut is far less complete. He emphasizes his empathy with some young Schutzbund memberswho at the clinic discussed their political desperation as well as their sexual problems. 22 Buthe says nothing about the committee or his expulsion from the party; Reich could at timesomit incidents unfavorable to himself. In later years, Reich liked to highlight his participa-tion as a physician in the radical political parties.In the committee he had functioned as apolitician leading a quixotic venture.Myron SharafFury On Earth152éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"These then were the cumulative factors at work in Reich’s decision to move toBerlin: his strained relations with his Viennese colleagues and the opportunity to work inBerlin with more analysts who shared his social concerns; the political weakness of theAustrian radical left versus the strong German Communist Party (with over 4 million mem-bers); and a better opportunity to pursue his personal analysis in Berlin.

Initially, Berlin met his expectation that it would provide a morehospitable environment for his work than Vienna had. Many of the younger Berlin ana-lysts—Otto Fenichel (who had moved to Berlin several years before), Erich Fromm, EdithJacobson, and Karen Homey —were sympathetic to Reich’s efforts to link psychoanalysisand Marxism, though none was as actively engaged in politics as he was1. The younger ana-lysts were also interested in Reich’s contributions to character analysis. So, shortly after hisarrival in the German capital, Reich established a technical seminar similar to the one he hadconducted in Vienna.Reich also joined the Communist Party, then the third largest party in Germany. Asin Vienna, he worked within a variety of political organizations and concentrated on sex-political themes. One of his first talks in Berlin, given before the Association for SocialistPhysicians, concerned the prevention of emotional disturbances; and early in 1931, headdressed a student group on “The Fiasco of Bourgeois Morality.”The ensuing discussion among the youth went on until five A.M.2For Reich, suchmeetings held an air of excitement that arose again when he reminisced about this period.He loved contact with people, especially the young. After 1934, when he was devoting him-selfmore to research, he kept recalling this period. I remember the note of sadness in hisvoice when in 1948 I told him I was going to speak before an anarchist group. He replied,“I envy you. I used to love to give talks but I can’t any more.”3Even as late as 1952, whenReich had long since detached himselffrom politics, he told Dr. Kurt Eissler about theBerlin period and the tremendous excitement generated at the sex-political meetings. “I stillthrive on that experience.”Along with his public speaking,Reich soon developed sex-counseling clinics simi-lar to those he had organized in Vienna. The work included sex education discussions, con-traceptive information, and individual short-term counseling. Annie Reich who, with thechildren, joined Reich in Berlin in the late autumn of 1930—Fenichel, Jacobson, and KatheMisch, all at the time members of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society, were among those whoworked with Reich in the clinics. Yet, as in Vienna, Reich was the driving force behind theenterprise intellectually,emotionally, and financially.If Reich anticipated today’s emphasis on dealing directly with sexual problems, hewas also ahead ofhis time in going directly to people rather than waiting for them to cometo his clinics.In this respect,he anticipated current community mental health practice, which155éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"advocates professional participation within the context of people’s daily lives—in schools,courts, industry, and the like. Reich still worked actively within the youth organizations ofthe Communist Party. He related an incident that had moved him deeply. A fourteen-year-old girl came from the Hitler Youth to one of the Communist youth groups Reich coun-seled. She was pregnant and had heard that “the Reds” had doctors who would be helpful.Reich made sure that the birth of the child occurred under good conditions. “I will neverforget the burning expression in the eyes of this girl.”4In addition to all his own work, Reich was also trying to influence the many fledg-ling organizations in Germany that were devoted to sex reform. These organizations werepart of the general atmosphere of innovation and sexual permissiveness that flourished dur-ing the Weimar years5.Despite their activity and their diversity, however, such organizations had littleinfluence on legislation. Because they sought Catholic support, the leftist political partieswere loath to affirm progressive sex legislation. The state thus continued as the sternguardian of private morals. This puritanical policy angered many left-wing intellectuals whoperceived it as a strong weapon of the bourgeoisie; the middle class, after all, could affordcertain means not available to the proletariat, such as illegal abortions.Even though these organizations proved ineffective in changing legislation, theyrepresented a considerable force in German life. Reich estimated that in 1930 there werearound 80 such groups, with a total membership of about 350,000 persons. He himself sup-ported many of their efforts, such as trying to provide legal and moral support to personsindicted for giving abortions, since their efforts were congruent with his own mass-psycho-logical work.At the same time, Reich had his differences with the sex organizations. He urgedthem to take a bolder stance on basic sexual matters, especially adolescent intercourse, ratherthan limiting themselves to a cautious endorsement of premarital relations for engaged cou-ples.He also pushed them to make clearer distinctions between healthy and sick sexuality.According to Reich,the illustrated newspapers put out by many organizations were notsharply distinguished from pornography. Dealers in contraceptives moved around at thepublic meetings,selling contraceptives at high prices.Within the reform movement, one of Reich’s main opponents was MagnusHirschfeld, a leader of the World League for Sexual Reform. Reich strongly opposedHirschfeld’s concern that the various forms of sexual repression should not be punished,and were moreover equally valid. What Reich advocated was a person’s right to live as he orshe wished sexually so long as it did not harm others. However, he did oppose a kind of“democracy of sexuality,” in which all sexual expressions were “equal.” Thus, he differedradically from Hirschfeld, from the decadent atmosphere of the Weimar Republic, and,indeed, from many current lifestyles.At that time the leaders of the World League for Sexual Reform wanted to avoidpolitical alignments,to represent their own cause independent of any particular party. Butone of Reich’s aims during the early 1930s was to unite the sex reform organizations with aMyron SharafFury On Earth156éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Marxist political program. He proposed that the separate sexual organizations should forma united front with cultural representatives from the German Communist Party. TheCommunist leadership agreed to the setting up of such an organization; it was called theGerman Association for Proletarian Sex-Politics (GAPSP), and Reich became one of itsdirectors.The executive body of the World League for Sexual Reform rejected Reich’s pro-posal as “too communistic.” But many of the individual organizations found his sex-politi-cal program very attractive. Representatives of eight organizations representing some 20,000people attended the first Congress of the GAPSP, which was held in Dusseldorf in the fallof 1931. There Reich presented a seven-point program, proposing6:1. Free distribution of contraceptives to those who could not obtain them throughnormal channels; massive propaganda for birth control.2. Abolition of laws against abortion. Provision for free abortions at public clinics;financial and medical safeguards for pregnant and nursing mothers.3. Abolition of any legal distinctions between the married and the unmarried.Freedom of divorce. Elimination of prostitution through economic and sex-eco-nomic changes to eradicate its causes.4. Elimination of venereal diseases by full sexual education.5. Avoidance of neuroses and sexual problems by a life-affirmative education.Study of principles of sexual pedagogy. Establishment of therapeutic clinics.6. Training of doctors, teachers, social workers, and so on, in all relevant matters ofsexual hygiene.7. Treatment rather than punishment for sexual offenses. Protection of childrenand adolescents against adult seduction.Reich noted that the Soviet Union had made considerable strides in implementingsuch a program,although he did not express his uneasiness about certain unwelcomechanges in their progressive position. Rather, he concentrated on the incompatibility, in hisview, of progressive sexual legislation and capitalism.Representatives of the organizations at the Congress joined Reich’s Association,and many members of other sex reform organizations were enthusiastic about his efforts.Branches ofGAPSP were formed in Stettin, Dresden, Leipzig, and Charlottenburg; withina short time, 40,000 members were affiliated. Reich was soon traveling extensively through-out the country, meeting with groups and helping to set up clinics.Reich’s furious activity was in part stimulated by the growing threat of Nazism. Itwas already late in 1931; he was appalled that so many on the left still tended to underesti-mate the appeal of Hitler and the Nazis and to dismiss Nazism as a passing aberration. Fewstudied carefully what Hitler was saying or why so many Germans were taken in by his prop-aganda.Reich took Hitler very seriously as a mass psychologist.Reich’s analysis of Hitler’s propaganda and why the average German was receptive13 : The Sex-political Furor: 1930-1934157éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"to it was formulated during the early 1930s, and published in 1933 as Massenpsychologie desFaschismus(The Mass Psychology of Fascism)7. Reich began with the question that had hauntedhim almost from the day he arrived in Berlin: Why did the masses turn to the Nazis insteadof the Communists? According to Marxist theory, the “objective conditions” for a socialisteconomy were present: a large industrial proletariat; economic impoverishment of the work-ing class; a strong Communist Party to provide the “vanguard” of the proletariat. Yet noswing to the left occurred.The explanations offered by the left for the rise of Nazism struck Reich as incred-ibly superficial. Each time the working classes behaved in a manner that belied their socialinterests, the Communists asserted that the workers had been deceived, that they lacked“class consciousness,” or had a “false consciousness.” Or they denied the significance ofHitler’s success by claiming that things would soon change for the better.Here we can note a similarity between Reich’s critique of psychoanalysis and his cri-tique of the Marxist parties. In each case he begins with a “negative finding,” a finding thathe, no more than others in his camp, initially expected. In the case of psychoanalysis, thenegative finding was that patients did not necessarily improve after “the unconscious wasmade conscious.” In the case of Marxism, the workers did not necessarily become more rev-olutionary in the face ofeconomic misery.Reich argued that a social psychologywas necessary to explain the contradictionbetween the economic frustrations endured by the proletariat and their lack of revolution-ary assertion against social conditions. He went on to argue that the character structure ofthe worker reflected his current socioeconomic position; it also reflected earlier social expe-riences, particularly his familial ones. The worker-as-child had learned obedience to his par-ents in particular and to authority figures in general; moreover, he had been taught to sup-press his sexual impulses. Hence in the adulte, rebellions and sexual impulses were accom-panied by anxiety, since both had been indiscriminately suppressed by the child’s educator.Fear of the revolt, as well as fear of sexuality, were thus “anchored” in the character struc-tures ofthe masses.This “anchoring”in personality provided a key to the irrationality ofthe working class—an irrationality that was often inadequately explained by such abstrac-tions as “the force of tradition.”What Reich did so well in his social analysis was to apply his clinical findings oncharacter armor to his analysis of the average person’s political or apolitical behavior. Just ascharacter armor prevented the patient from arriving at true “emotional” insight, so it pre-vented the citizen from taking an aggressive stance toward social problems. As Reich put it:Suppression ofthe natural sexuality in the child, particularly of its genital sexuali-ty, makes the child apprehensive, shy, obedient, afraid of authority, good and adjust-ed in the authoritarian sense; it paralyzes the rebellious forces because any rebellionis laden with anxiety; it produces, by inhibiting sexual curiosity and sexual thinkingin the child,a general inhibition ofthinking and of critical faculties. In brief, thegoal of sexual suppression is that of producing an individual who is adjusted to theMyron SharafFury On Earth158éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"authoritarian order and who will submit to it in spite of all misery and degradation.At first the child has to submit to the structure of the authoritarian miniature state,the family; this makes it capable of later subordination of the general authoritariansystem. The formation of the authoritarian structure takes place through theanchoring of sexual inhibition and sexual anxiety8.Today, through the efforts of such social analysts as Erich Fromm, TheodorAdorno, and Richard Hofstadter, we have become very familiar with the notion that tounderstand political movements one must grasp the psychological structure of the peopleconnected with them. But when Reich wrote The Mass Psychology of Fascismin 1933 (almostten years before Fromm’s Escape from Freedom9, almost twenty years before The AuthoritarianPersonality10), his ideas were exceedingly original.But how did Reich’s ideas apply specifically to the rise of Nazism? Reich’s stress onthe submissiveness of the average person might lead one to expect that the German voterwould support a conservative, authoritarian government, but not necessarily the emotionalfrenzy Hitler represented. However, in Reich’s analysis, the average German was not simply“armored.” In addition to the economic misery that mobilized the workers, there were alsostrong emotional desires, longings that emerged in distorted form. These impulses wereintensified by the increased permissiveness of the 1920s.The Germans, then, were caught—to follow Reich’s analysis—by their simultane-ous desire for freedom and their fear of it. Calls for a more exciting life as well as appealsto “law and order” struck deep resonances. And it was precisely here that Hitler demonstrat-ed his genius as a mass psychologist. His opponents criticized him for his contradictions; butas the historian Konrad Heiden remarked,it was Hitler’s “art of contradiction which madehim the greatest and most successful propagandist of his time.”11In no other sphere did Hitler play so skillfully on the contradictions within the aver-age German as with his family ideology. Hitler idealized the German family, calling for itspreservation against “cultural Bolshevism.” (The Soviet and German Communists wereidentified with the break-up ofthe family and “free love,” a position the Russians hadalready retreated from and one the German Communists never endorsed.) Hitler promisedthe subjugation of woman to man, the enforcement of her economic dependence, andstrong measures against both the birth control movement and abortion.As Reich noted, however, at the same time that Hitler supported traditional familylife he also endorsed many of the demands of the young against the old. He attracted youthsin large numbers from parental homes and collectivized their existence. Indeed, “Aryan”youths were encouraged to have children, inside or outside marriage, if they believed thatthey were begetting them to improve the race. And the Nazi emphasis on “MotherGermany”and “Father Hitler” permitted many Germans to transfer familial feelings to themystique of the super-nation—the Fatherland.Hitler’s racial policies at once mobilized the average person’s sexual fears and pro-vided him with a convenient scapegoat. Again and again, Hitler harped on the Jew and the13 : The Sex-political Furor: 1930-1934159éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Negro as polluters of the “Aryan” blood. This paranoic concept, with its emphasis on the“poisoning of the national body,” had a wide appeal. The Jew especially, in Hitler’s mythol-ogy, provided a target for the projection of sexual, anti-sexual, and anti-capitalist sentiments,since the Jew was pictured simultaneously as seducer, castrator, and Shylock.The left erred badly when it tried to refute Nazi propaganda by asserting that Hitlerwas a reactionary, used by big business to serve its interests. While objectively true, thismissed the essential point of how Hitler was uniting the contradictions in the people. Muchof his propaganda called into play revolutionary sentiments in the form of diffuse protestsagainst the capitalist “bosses” who ran things. At the same time, the fear of internationalrevolutionary change—the sense of chaos it invoked, the threat to nationalist pride wasmobilized by attacks on “swinish” Bolsheviks who would subvert the German nation. Thevery term “national socialism” expressed this unity of contradictions, appealing to national-istic feelings and to the yearning for socialism. For Hitler did not require people to thinkthrough the facts seriously; he would take care of everything for them.Reich had a keen eye—and ear—for Hitler’s use of sexual imagery and feeling inhis propaganda techniques. The emphasis on soldiers marching, on uniforms, on mass can-dlelight meetings, the sexually toned imagery of Hitler’s speeches, his rhythmic, hypnoticoratory—all helped to whip people into an emotional frenzy. One has only to see the facesof people listening to Hitler (conveyed so vividly in the documentary films of LeniRiefenstahl) to realize the kind of orgiastic satisfaction the Germans could allow themselvesin their devotion to the Fuhrer. This intense libidinal excitation, combined with a sense ofmoral righteousness, was strikingly similar to the atmosphere at religious revival meetings.As part of his analysis of Hitler’s mass-psychological appeal, Reich devoted a shortchapter to the symbolism of the swastika. Studying the design itself and the history of thesymbol, Reich concluded that the swastika was a schematic but unmistakable representationof two intertwined bodies12.Faced with the cleverness of Hitler’s appeal to the emotions, Reich was all the moreappalled at the ineffectiveness ofCommunist propaganda. He recalled with horror one par-ticular Communist meeting,attended by about 20,000 industrial and white-collar workers.Shortly before, there had been some fatalities in clashes with the Nazis, so the crowd’s moodhad risen to the boiling point.Everyone waited tensely for the main speech. Then theCommunist leader, Ernst Thalmann, killed the mood totally by devoting his talk to a com-plex analysis ofthe government’s budget.Reich believed that the only political answer to the distorted “sex-politics” of Hitlerwas his own positive sex-politics. One did not answer Hitler’s use of the Jews as scapegoatsby pointing out the intellectual fallacies ofhis argument or its function as a diversion fromother issues. One countered by directly dealing with the people’s sexual longings. Reich’sposition was based on his conviction that “the average individual will affirm the sex-eco-nomic regulation of sexual life if he is made to understand it Sex-economy gives the politi-cal answer to the chaos which was created by the conflict between compulsive morality andsexual libertinism.”13Myron SharafFury On Earth160éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Reich coined the term “sex-economy” around 1930. By it he meant “that body ofknowledge which deals with the economy of the biological energy in the organism, with itsenergy household.”14The use of the word “economy” also reflects a Marxist influence:The safeguarding of the distribution of goods requires a rational economic policy. A ration-al sexual policy is not different if the same obvious principles are applied to sexual insteadof economic needs. In his sex-political work, Reich soon met with difficulties that he blamedon everyone else but the “average individual.” Work seemed to go poorly when he was notpresent. The Communist functionaries complained that nothing but sexual questions werediscussed. Emphasis on the class struggle receded. There was also a falling off of commit-ment from the allied sex reform groups, for which Reich blamed the party functionaries15.In later years, Reich was critical not only of the Communists but also of his ownapproach. In his interview with Kurt Eissler, he commented that he moved too rapidly andstirred up more interest among the people than he had the resources to deal with effective-ly. By the time of the interview, he believed that one should not approach sexual questionspolitically. However, one should change antisexual laws.Reich’s aversion to politics after about 1936 is a subject for future chapters. I willsimply note here an apparent contradiction: the injunction against “doing it politically” com-bined with the injunction to “change the laws,” which cannot be done except politically.In the context of the Berlin period, however, we return to the question of whyReich “did it politically.” He was quite aware of the argument advanced by one psychoana-lyst against sex-politics: “How is it possible to overcome sexual repression in the masses ifone does not have a mass technique corresponding to the individual analytic technique?”16Reich’s answer was that perhaps a technique would emerge from the practice ofsex-politics.He was working with two hypotheses:that without positive sex-politics, Hitler’sdiabolical manipulation ofdistorted sexuality would triumph; and that his own sex-politicscould win, if the leadership was right. Although he never abandoned the first conviction, inlater years he realized that the second hypothesis overlooked the depth of sexual anxiety inpeople;that any leadership would have failed with the people responding to Hitler’s “unityofcontradictions.”The very naiveté of his optimism provided learning experiences a more cautiousperson would have missed. Thus, Reich noted that while he did not have a technique formass therapy,there were certain advantages to group meetings over individual therapy:She [the patient] does not feel alone. She feels that all the others also listen to these“prohibited” things. Her individual moral inhibition is countered by a collectiveatmosphere of sexual affirmation, by a new, sex-economic morality. ... It is a mat-ter ofmaking the suppression conscious, of setting the fight between sexuality andmysticism into the focus ofconsciousness,or arousing it ... and of channeling itinto social action17.Even later he never disavowed this mass therapy approach entirely, although he did13 : The Sex-political Furor: 1930-1934161éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"reject its political connection as he became more aware of the pitfalls that surrounded it. Itis ironic that in the same year Reich published The Mass Psychology of Fascism, 1933, he wasalso to publish Character Analysis, which focused on the intricate problems in the way ofremoving the defenses against sexuality. The Reich of Character Analysis lives on throughtherapists who practice individual treatment largely with upper- and middleclass patients.The Reich ofMass Psychologyis reflected in various kinds of group approaches that make useof nonprofessionals, for example, the use of discussion groups in the women’s movement.These approaches attempt to reach a large number of people. Their aim is often more to“raise consciousness” than to give immediate help. The establishment therapists and thesocially engaged group leaders may fight each other’s views; yet each quotes the parts ofReich that fit their argument best. Few move as restlessly, as tormentedly, back and forthbetween the positions as Reich himself did.In the early 1930s, however, Reich was primarily the mass psychologist bent ondefeating Nazism. He felt at least as thwarted by his political friends as by his enemies. Inparticular, the Communist Party leadership was increasingly disturbed by his activities. In1932, he was involved with several publications dealing with sex-political issues for the aver-age working person. The first, which Reich himself wrote, was entitled Der Sexuelle Kampf derJugend(The Sexual Struggle of Youth)18.Aimed at a youthful audience, the pamphlet describedsimply and clearly the sexual issues of adolescents, relating these to the political struggle. AtReich’s suggestion, Annie Reich wrote a pamphlet on sex education for mothers,Wenn DeinKind Dich Fragt(When Your Child Asks You)19. Again at Reich’s suggestion, and with his col-laboration, several teachers composed a small booklet for children entitled Das Kreidedreiech(The Chalk Triangle)20.The last publication deserves a few words, for I believe The Chalk Trianglewasunique in its time for the frankness with which it dealt with sex education to be read to orby children between the ages of eight and twelve. In very simple language and with anabsorbing story line,it tells how a group of children debate among themselves where babiescome from. Stork myths, babies from kissing, and so on prevail. One girl suggests her par-ents will explain the true facts.The parents, clearly modeled on the Reichs, answer some ofthe children’s questions about reproduction. The children talk over what they have heard.They seek and have a second talk with the parents because they still do not understand howthe baby gets inside the mother’s stomach. In true analytic fashion, the father tries to elicittheir ideas, and they come close—“Is it like what happens between animals?” But many oftheir notions are confused, even frightening—“the man pierces a hole in the woman and ithurts terribly.”The father explains the process of intercourse, emphasizing its pleasurable aspects.The content of intercourse is not confined to legal marriage nor its goal to reproduction.Contraception is explained.The children leave enlightened. Then one of the boys is severe-ly punished by his parents when he tells them what he has learned. The other children helpthe boy hide from his parents, who out of alarm become repentant. The story is interlacedwith heavy-handed political messages:children told lies about sex will later believe capitalistMyron SharafFury On Earth162éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"political lies; the unity of the oppressed (the children) overcomes the oppressors (the boys’parents); and so forth.All three publications were extremely popular in working-class circles.The ChalkTrianglewas used by Communist discussion leaders for children’s groups. But The SexualStruggle of Youthwas to evoke a controversy so intense that it culminated in Reich’s exclusionfrom the Communist Party. There were intimations of the controversy in the pre-publica-tion period. Reich wanted the Communist Party to publish the work, so he submitted thefinal manuscript to the committee for youth in the German Communist Party. The latteraccepted it but sent it along to the central committee for youth in Moscow. The Moscowcommittee approved the book but felt it would be wiser if the party were not to publish it.They recommended its publication by a “front” organization, a workers’ cultural associationclose to the party but not part of it. Reich gave this association the manuscript during thesummer of 1931; by March 1932 it still had not appeared. Reich believed the organizationwas sabotaging publication, but exactly why was not clear to him21.Ever impatient and ever the analyst, Reich always observed resistance and hostility,or at least ambivalence, in such postponements, and he could work himself into a fury aboutsuch stumbling blocks. Finally, exasperated with the delays, convinced that publication ofthe pamphlet was essential to counteract the Nazis’appeal to youth, Reich established in thesummer of 1932 his own publishing house, Verlag fur Sexualpolitik. The same year itbrought out The Sexual Struggle of Youthas well as When Your Child Asks Youand The ChalkTriangle.Reich’s decision to establish his own press was wise, since by 1932 he was begin-ning to have difficulties in publishing his clinical papers in the International Journal ofPsychoanalysis. Before that, he had always published his papers and books through analyticmedia or in Marxist journals. After 1932, no publishing house other than his own wouldaccept his manuscripts during his lifetime.* For some months the German Communist Party helped to circulate the sex educa-tional works,which initially received positive reviews in the various party newspapers. Buttrouble was already brewing. New difficulties arose when Reich attended a youth conferencein Dresden on October 16, 1932. At its conclusion a resolution was issued strongly endors-ing adolescent sexuality,within the framework of the revolutionary movement.The adult Communist leaders were aghast. Afraid that opponents would makepolitical capital out ofthis bold statement,they quickly disowned it, claiming that the reso-lution dragged political tasks “down to the level of the gutter.” They also asserted that the“instigator ofthe resolution should be excluded from the Party immediately.”22When it was learned that Reich was the instigator, there was considerable embar-rassment. Not only had the party distributed his writings; he himself was prominent in left-ist circles. Something clearly had to be done to put a distance between the party and Reich.13 : The Sex-political Furor: 1930-1934163éditionsles atomes de l’âme* Four years after his death, in 1961, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux began the publication of much of his work inthe English language."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"This the party did with the following notice in the December 5 issue of the German news-paper Roter Sport(Red Sport), stating that Reich’s pamphlets would no longer be circulatedbecause they were contrary to the true Marxist .education of youth23.Following the edict, bitter disputes arose between youth groups strongly in favor ofthe sex-political publications and the party hierarchy that opposed them. The party broughtin its big guns to crush the opposition. Its leaders declared that Reich was “counter-revolu-tionary,” that “Reich wishes to make fornication organizations out of our associations,” thathis publications “discredited Marxism,” that “there were no orgasm disturbances among theproletariat, only among the bourgeoisie,” and that Reich was replacing the “class struggle”with the conflict between the young and the adults.Under such pressure, a woman representative who had previously been enthusias-tic about sex-political meetings now took the position that “anatomic details” and “unaes-thetic irrelevancies” should not be discussed24. Reich was impressed that people couldchange their opinions so rapidly, moving with the tide and particularly with the leaders’ shiftsin sentiment. Later on he made a point of not fully trusting students and associates until “Ifirst see how you are in a crisis.”He received considerable personal support, even though he did not actively wage acampaign against his opponents. In one meeting of GAPSP, he gained 32 votes, theCommunist Party representatives 39. But the force of party leadership eventually swung sen-timent fully in its favor—and against Reich.Reich’s defeat within the Communist Party coincided with the left’s defeat at thehands of the Nazis. On January 30, 1933, General Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellorof Germany, the first step toward his total dictatorship a few weeks later. On February 27,the Reichstag fire broke out, an incident the Nazis used as a pretext to arrest 1,500 left-wingofficials and intellectuals. Many of Reich’s Marxist friends had gone underground or beenarrested. On March 2, an attack on Reich’s youth book appeared in the Nazi newspaperVolkischer Beobachter.Reich felt he had to flee quickly, so about March 3 he left for Vienna.His children had left shortly before to stay with their grandparents in Vienna. Soon after-ward, Annie Reich would also leave for Vienna. However, by this time the marriage was over,as we shall see in Chapter 15.On March 5, Hitler received 44 percent of the vote in a national election, enoughof a plurality to assure him dictatorship. There was now no question of Reich’s returning toBerlin.In retrospect,it is clear that Reich never had a chance of organizing a major sex-political effort against the Nazis. A few years later, in People in Trouble, he compared his effortto that of a physician who faced the facts while the party continued to believe “in the heal-ing power of useless medication.” He realized that he was dealing with a “moribund patient”who could not be helped25.Yet part of Reich still could not believe that the patient was moribund, and felt thathis approach couldwin.Such optimism is puzzling in someone like Reich who realized theMyron SharafFury On Earth164éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"inner obstacles to healthy adult sexuality. His crucial error during this period lay in the beliefthat the “average individual will affirm the sex-economic regulation of sexual life if he ismade to understand it.” This statement is nonsense unless all kinds of qualifications are con-tained in the subordinate clause. And as we have seen, Reich reacted as though the mainobstacle to getting his message over to the average person were some of the party leaders.In his excessive optimism, Reich was also an extremely poor political tactician. Hesaid as much about himself in claiming, “I am not a politician.” But something more wasinvolved. Whenever he was engaged in a battle—whether with the Social Democrats in1929, the Communists in 1932, or the Food and Drug Administration in the 1950s—hecould not make a realistic assessment of who was for him and who against him. Such over-optimism would ultimately cost him dearly.Reich remained in Vienna for less than two months. It soon became apparent thathis position there was untenable, for Freud’s objections to both Reich’s sex-political workand his ardent communism had grown in the intervening years. Ironically, while theCommunists escalated their attacks on Reich as a “Freudian,” the psychoanalytic establish-ment was eager to distance itself from the way Reich drew social conclusions from clinicalresearch.The parallels were reflected in the matter of his publications. In January 1933,Reich had signed a contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers (of whichFreud was the editorial director) to publish his book Character Analysis. On March 17, Freudadvised Reich—whether by letter, phone, or in person is not clear—that the contract wascancelled26. According to Reich, Freud gave as his reason the deteriorating political situa-tion in Vienna. For on March 4 the right-wing government of Engelbert Dollfuss had uti-lized “emergency laws” to restrict all civil liberties.Undoubtedly, Freud’s decision was not due simply to political caution—as Reichimplies—but to his distaste for Reich’s sex-political activities. Reich protested the decision,yet there was little he could do about it. The book was already in galleys, the psychoanalyt-ic publishing house would help distribute it,but printing costs had to be paid for by Reich,and the official publisher was to be his own Verlag fur Sexualpolitik.Unhappy with the situation in Vienna, Reich decided to move to Copenhagen,arriving on May i.Several people in Denmark had expressed interest in studying with him,and very shortly he had a practice going. One of his first concerns there was to completehis manuscript The Mass Psychology ofFascism,But he had to develop his analytic practice inthe new city before he could afford to publish the book in the fall of 1933.No sooner had he left the psychoanalytic conflicts in Vienna than Reich was backamid controversies with the Communists in Copenhagen. Despite all his difficulties inBerlin, he still considered himself a Communist; accordingly, he turned to the DanishCommunist Party to help out many needy German refugees now settled in Copenhagen. Butwhen the party representative started asking to see the emigration permits, including Reich’sown,Reich exploded with frustration. This incident, he believed, further aggravated thewrath of the Communists against him27.13 : The Sex-political Furor: 1930-1934165éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Two other incidents occurred. A Danish Communist journal, Plan, had publishedan article by Reich, “Where Does Nudist Education Lead To?” which had originally beenpublished in 1928 in the Journal for Psychoanalytic Pedagogy. A zealous Minister of Justice inDenmark had brought a suit against Plan’s editor, charging him with pornography. At leastpart of the alleged offense turned on a translation of the German word Wipfi, a children’sterm for the genitals. Questioned by a Danish journalist, Reich commented that the transla-tion ofWipfiand a few other terms was careless, but there was no question of pornogra-phy. When the editor of Plan received a jail sentence of forty days, the Danish CommunistParty accused Reich of betraying the editor with his slight qualification28.The other charge against Reich concerned The Mass Psychology of Fascism. Its firstsentence read: “The German working class has suffered a severe defeat” (i.e., the victory ofHitler). But according to the party line, the working class had only suffered “a temporarysetback in the revolutionary surge,” so when the book appeared, the party journals charac-terized it as an attack on revolutionary politics29.On November 21, 1933, a notice appeared in large print in the Danish Communistnewspaper Arbeiderblatt, announcing that Reich had been expelled from the party. The basesfor the expulsion were Reich’s “party-inimical and uncommunistic” behavior and his pub-lishing a book with “counter-revolutionary” content. Writing in 1952, Reich made much ofthe point that he could not have been expelled from the Danish Communist Party becausehe never belonged to it. Nor could he have been excluded from the German CommunistParty because it had ceased to exist in March 1933. This was not his view at the time. Evenafter his exclusion he continued to consider himself a member of the Communist move-ment, if not of the party: “My position was that of a badly mistreated and misunderstoodopposition.”30Why did Reich stay so long in the party, and why did he refrain from attacking it forsome time after his expulsion? Why did he put up with party officials “criticizing” his man-uscript? He once said admiringly to his friend Lia Laszky with regard to her membership inthe Communist Party: “You were the smartest of us—the first to join and the first to leave.”Part ofthe reason for Reich’s lengthy, if partial, acceptance of Communist leadershe considered to be blockheads was his overall commitment to Marxism as a socioeconom-ic philosophy. More immediately, for Reich the Communists seemed to provide the onlypolitical answer to the threat ofNazism. And even as late as 1933 he regarded the SovietUnion, the Marxist experiment, as the most progressive society in the world.Perhaps, too, some of his reasons were more personal. Reich alluded to these fac-tors in People in Trouble(about 1936) when he stated that he remained in the party despitemisgivings because it had become a “second home.”31“A second home”—Reich had used a similar phrase to define how he perceived thepsychoanalytic movement, which he also had a very hard time leaving. Reich’s early homelife had been unhappy. In many ways his marriage with Annie had been unhappy. Not sur-prisingly, he felt a strong need for family, not just his own private family but a family of fel-low fighters,scientists, revolutionaries. And a part of him still wanted pater familiasand aMyron SharafFury On Earth166éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"mater familias.Metaphorically, Reich had described his scientific origins when he wrote:“Psychoanalysis is the father and sociology [Marxism] the mother of sex-economy.”32Ona more personal level, as we have seen, Reich sought the paternal in Freud and Freudbrought out the paternal in Reich, for learning analytic skills involved a master-apprenticerelationship.Marxism, too, was scientific and systematic, but its practical application was farmore fluid than the translation of analytic theory into practice. The most expert theoreti-cians could prove to be the biggest fools in actual events, while the poor and untrained couldhave the keenest sense of what was really happening. And while Marxism claimed to beunsentimental, simply clarifying the class struggle, there could be no doubt that it stimulat-ed infinite hopes for a better life. And not simply a better life, but a fulfilled and “unalien-ated” one. For Reich, this kind of yearning may well have represented his mother’s influ-ence.Reich was deeply hurt by his exclusion from the Communist Party. It meant not justthe end of three years’ work with the German Party, but the end of his formal affiliationwith the political left,an affiliation he had maintained in one form or another ever since hejoined the youth movement in Vienna after World War I. One way Reich softened the blowofhis exclusion was to permit the full implications of leaving radical politics to sink in onlylittle by little. In 1934, he was still “loyal” to the Communist movement but critical of theparty apparatus. In his optimism, he was searching for a new revolutionary social organiza-tion that would be willing to learn from the lessons ofthe catastrophe. But the one suchpossible party available to him, Trotsky’s Fourth International, proved unsatisfactory. Severalleading Trotskyites visited him around this time. In the course of the discussion Reich real-ized that his visitors, while sympathetic, did not take sex-politics seriously33.The year 1934, then, was one of political uncertainty for Reich as he struggled toreorient himself. He wrote a pamphlet,Was ist Klassenbewusstsein?(What Is Class Consciousness?),in which he clarified the progressive and conservative aspects of “class consciousness” inwomen,working-class men, adolescents, and children. Again, his social endeavors paralleledhis clinical concepts: in both realms he sought to dissolve the defenses, anxieties, guilts, andto strengthen the genuine, progressive, vital forces.In the same pamphlet, Reich clearly stated his organizational position as of late1934. The sex-political movement, he wrote, had the choice of starting its own organizationand recruiting members based on its declared program; or it could be allowed more time todevelop informally. Reich concluded that the second alternative would avoid prematurebureaucracy and the dangers of sectarianism; it would also permit greater influence withinother organizations.The decision was an important one since it anticipated much of Reich’s later socialthought and practice. It was still a political decision, in that he believed his ideology wouldin time permeate the masses to such an extent that the organization of a political partywould be feasible. Basically, Reich was to maintain this model, with one significant alter-13 : The Sex-political Furor: 1930-1934167éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"ation—he dropped the idea of ever organizing a party. What would permeate the masseswould be work skills and orientations; people with such skills would join together to per-form practical tasks in education, medicine, sociology. Once again we can note a crucial tran-sition in 1934, a transition that contained elements of the old as it moved toward the new.[Here was the photos’ album]Myron SharafFury On Earth168éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break withthe Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934Reich once said: “There has always been a conflict in me between the urge to par-ticipate in the social battle, on the one hand, and my scientific work, on the other. In socialstruggles, you have to be here, there, and everywhere; in scientific work you stay in yourstudy with books, patients, and instruments”.1While we have seen Reich struggling “in the social battle” during the 1930s, theother side of him was quietly developing his theory of character analysis. Many of the ana-lytic students in training with him at that time were only in touch with this side of his workand personality. One American student, Dr. 0. Spurgeon English, who was in analysis withReich between September 1929 and April 1932, has given a good account of the clinicalReich in the Berlin years. He opens with: “I recall Dr. Reich utilizing his interest in otherthan verbal presentations of the personality. For instance, he would frequently call attentionto my position on the couch... .”2One issue concerned Reich’s training standards and the discipline he imposed.Reich had reminded English that he would need a letter from Reich in order to become amember of the International Psychoanalytic Association. He said that English took manypsychoanalytic concepts too lightly and that if Reich “continued to hear the still presentsounds ofridicule about analysis,” the letter of recommendation would not be written.English,jolted by this edict,was nonetheless grateful for the hard and fruitful workit stimulated.“Somehow or other I had landed in the hands of a no-nonsense, hard-work-ing, meticulous analyst who had a keen ear for the various forms of resistance and a goodability to tolerate the aggression which almost inevitably follows necessary confrontation ofsubtly concealed ... resistance.”In connection with Reich’s handling of negative feelings, English related the follow-ing incident:One day Reich telephoned to ask if he could change English’s appointment frommorning to afternoon.English said he already had a social engagement. Reich retorted, wasthe social engagement more important than the analysis? Irritated, English replied that itwas. After hanging up, he became incensed that Reich should question his right to enjoyhimself socially: the longer he thought about it, the angrier he got. During the next sessionEnglish told Reich he had always kept to the analyst’s schedule, and that having made anappointment Reich should keep it. English went on to rail against Reich’s busy life, whichnow necessitated requesting the change. Reich listened patiently until English wound down,169éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"then merely said: “You are perfectly right.” English was amazed. “I had the first and perhapsgreatest lesson in my life of the fact that a human being may be self-assertive and be giventhe right to an opinion and not be criticized for it or have acknowledgment given grudging-ly.”English’s account of his treatment with Reich contains no new information aboutReich’s theory or techniques. Yet the period was extremely important in the evolution ofReich’s therapy. Until the late 1920s, Reich had concentrated on three main concepts in hischaracter-analytic work: latent negative transference, defensive character traits, and nonver-bal forms of expression. During the late 1920s and up to 1934, his focus fell on three othersubjects: the development of a typology of neurotic character structures and their child-hood etiology; the distinction between the genital character and the neurotic character; andthe problem of masochism.In his development of neurotic character structures, Reich brought a sharp focusto the way character attitudes are shaped in childhood and the particular form they takebecause of particular experiences, especially familial ones. A good example of Reich’s workin this realm is his presentation of the “aristocratic character.” This example illustrates whythe psychiatric scholar Leston Havens has called Reich perhaps the only equal of the famednineteenth-century diagnostician Emil Kraepelin in “psychiatric portraiture.”3A thirty-three-year-old man came to analysis because of marital difficulties andwork problems. The connections Reich made between the patient’s difficulties and his earlychildhood experiences were—at a content level—not especially striking. What is moreimpressive, and what Reich focused upon, was the patient’s manner and attitudes:The patient is good-looking, of medium height; his facial expression is reserved,serious, somewhat arrogant. His gait is measured, refined. ... It takes him quite sometime to get from the door to the couch. His speech is measured He lies on thecouch in a composed manner with his legs crossed. His dignified composure hard-ly ever changes at all,even with the discussion of ... painful subjects. When after awhile ...he discussed his relationship with his mother whom he loved very much, itwas easy to see how he intensified his dignified attitude in order to master his exci-tation.In spite ofmy repeated admonitions to give his feelings free reign he main-tained his attitude....This much had become clear: his behavior, no matter what was its origin, pro-tected him against violent emotions [His character] had already become a resist-ance4.One day, Reich went on, “I told him he was play-acting an English lord, and thatthis must have a connection with his youth.”5Reich’s remark triggered the patient’s comment that he had never believed he wasreally the son of his father, a small Jewish merchant; he thought that he was in fact ofEnglish origin.He had heard rumors that his maternal grandmother had had an affair withMyron SharafFury On Earth170éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"a real English lord and that his mother was half-English.Reich continued: “Consistent analysis of the lordly’ behavior showed that it wasconnected with ... his tendency to deride everybody... . The sadistic fantasies ... were grati-fied in the derision and warded off in the lordliness... . The arrogant behavior ... served thepurpose of warding off a drive as well as its satisfaction.”6Reich connected the development of the lordliness trait with the man’s specificchildhood experiences. For one thing, it was a counter-identification with his father, whowas anything but lordly; in fights between the parents, the boy took the mother’s side andvowed to be as unlike his father as possible. There was also a specificity to the timing of itsorigin. Between the ages of three and six, the patient had suffered from an intense phobiaabout mice. The lord fantasy provided a way of binding the phobic anxiety. Indeed, after itsdevelopment the fear of mice disappeared.Reich summarizes: “The development of a phobia indicates that the ego was tooweak to master certain libidinal strivings. The development of a character trait or typical atti-tude at the expense of a phobia means a strengthening of the ego in the form of chronicarmoring against the id and the outer world.”7The notion of character traits as a way ofbinding emotions, especially anxiety, is a keyto Reich’s characterological work. The kind of detailed description Reich provided for his“aristocratic” patient he also gave for more general types, for example, the hysterical char-acter, the compulsive character, and the phallic-narcissistic character. Although his descrip-tions as well as his theory continued the investigations made by other analysts, notably Freudand Karl Abraham, Reich added a wealth of detail, an elaborated conceptual framework, andsuggestions for therapy that surpassed previous work. His characterological typology hasbeen quoted more than any other aspect of his work.Yet Reich’s original contribution lay not so much in the distinctions among variousneurotic character types as in what distinguished all of them from another type—the geni-tal character.In a paper published in 1929 and later incorporated in expanded form into CharacterAnalysis, Reich distinguished between character structures in a fundamentally new way: onthe basis ofthe presence or absence oforgastic potency. Here, he linked his character-ana-lytic work with his work on genitality. Orgastic potency, or the unimpeded expression ofgenitality, became the explicit goal of character analysis.Reich described the genital character as one that has fully reached the post-ambiva-lent genital stage; the wish for incest and the wish to eliminate the parent of the same sexhave been relinquished.Up to this point, Reich essentially followed Abraham. But now hesounds a unique note: the genital character is capable of orgastic potency, which preventsthe damming up of libido and the pathogenic outbreak of pregenital impulses.The neurotic character, on the other hand, is completely under the sway of infan-tile impulses and wishes. “If there is any sexual life at all, its infantile nature can be readilyseen:the woman represents the mother or the sister and the love relationship carries thestamp of all the anxieties ... and [inhibitions and] neurotic peculiarities of the infantile incest14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break with the Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934171éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"relationship.”8For the genital character, achievement does not represent a proof of potency as inthe neurotic person but provides a natural gratification. The neurotic character experiencesa more or less conscious feeling of impotence; social achievement becomes primarily a com-pensating proof of potency. Still, no matter how hard he works, the neurotic character nevergets rid of an inner emptiness and feeling of incapacity.Reich defends himself against the charge that the genital character lives in a kind ofparadise. He or she is in fact accessible to a high degree of unpleasure as well as pleasure:“The capacity for tolerating unpleasure and pain without fleeing disillusioned into a state ofrigidity goes hand in hand with the capacity to take happiness and to give love. To useNietzsche’s words: he who wants to learn to ‘jubilate to high heaven’ must be prepared tobe ‘dejected unto death.’ ”9The genital character has an armor, but that armor is pliable enough to allow adap-tation to various situations. Reich vividly describes the emotional range of his “genital char-acter”: “[He] can be very gay but also intensely angry; he reacts to an object-loss withdepression but does not get lost in it; he is capable of intense love but also of intense hatred;he can be ... childlike but he will never appear infantile; his seriousness is natural and not stiffin a compensatory way because he has no tendency to show himself grown-up at allcost...”10In contrast, the neurotic character “would like to be gay or angry but cannot. Hecannot love intensely because his sexuality is essentially repressed.”11Nor can he hateappropriately because his hatred has grown violent due to libido stasis, and therefore he hasto repress it.I would stress the paucity ofdata Reich had on which to base his concept of health.It seems clear that he studied himself as a source of data for the genital and neurotic char-acter and for what he meant by “healthy”functioning. When he first described orgasticpotency,he drew upon his own experiences and the experiences of relatively few patients.By 1929, he could add some experience with industrial workers whom he considered“healthy”and Malinowski’s ethnographic reports on the Trobrianders (see Chapter 11). Butabove all he appears to have continued to draw on his self-observations. His distinctionsbetween genital and neurotic characters hinge heavily on the greater vitality of the former.And vitality was what everybody—friend and foe alike—noted in Reich.Although Reich often wrote about the “genital character” as though it were a “real”thing,he was well aware that it was a construct or an “ideal type.” As he put it:Since the distinction [between the neurotic character and the genital character] isbased on a quantitative criterion the extent of either direct sexual gratification orlibido stasis there are all kinds oftransitions between the two ideal types. Inspite ofthis, a typological investigation is not only justified but imperative because of itsheuristic values and of the help it provides in practical work12.Myron SharafFury On Earth172éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"In connection with the third subject—masochism—Reich often wrote about histechnique of character analysis with considerable optimism, at the same time that he wasaware of the depth of the therapeutic obstacles. This awareness was also stimulated by oth-ers’ formulations of the problems in ways that he opposed. The case in point is Freud’s laterconcept of masochism.In his early work, Freud had viewed masochism as the expression of destructiveimpulses toward the world that turned against the self out of frustration and fear of pun-ishment. In this view, the basic initial conflict was between self and the world; it followedthe pleasure principle. To torment the self, physically or psychologically, was less painful thanto lose the love of parents or parental surrogates, less painful than the feared punishmentfor expressing the anger outward.Around 1920, Freud believed he had to move “beyond the pleasure principle.” Onthe basis of that principle alone, he felt unable to explain certain repetitive phenomena suchas the fondness of children for repeating games, even painful ones; the recurrent dreams ofwar-neurotics in which the original trauma is revived again and again; the pattern of self-injury that can be traced through the lives of many people; and the tendency of a numberof patients to reenact during psychoanalysis (despite ample self-awareness) unpleasant expe-riences oftheir childhood.Freud now explained these and related phenomena on the basis of a “deathinstinct” that led to primarymasochism. The same instinct could also be directed toward theworld in the form of sadistic urges and actions.This concept of the death instinct clashed with Reich’s more positive view of clin-ical theory. Prior to the early 1930s, Reich avoided any direct confrontation with a conceptthat carried Freud’s full authority, though he had talked about the “sublimation” of sadisticimpulses and their decrease with sexual gratification. But by 1932, Reich felt prepared topublish a case history of a masochistic patient in an article that directly challenged “deathinstinct”theory. The case history presented was that of a young man who had been in treat-ment for four years.Reich’s introductory description oftypical masochistic character traits is brief:“Subjectively, a chronic sense of suffering, which appears objectively as a tendency to complain;chronic tendencies to self-damageand self-depreciation(moral masochism) and a compulsion totorture otherswhich makes the patient suffer no less than the object.”13Right from the start he focused on the patient’s sexual behavior. The young man,who was incapable of working and had no social interests, would masturbate every night forhours. He would roll around on his stomach with the fantasy that a man or woman was beat-ing him with a whip.When the excitement mounted, he would hold back the ejaculation, letthe excitation subside, and then begin all over again.After Reich did some work on the patient’s defenses, the patient entered a spitefulphase. In answer to any request from Reich, he would cry: “I won’t, I won’t” This kind ofstubbornness was what he had shown his parents as a young child, when he would kick andyell, rendering his parents helpless and furious.14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break with the Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934173éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"At one point the patient reacted suddenly with involuntary kicking. This was thefirst time Reich reported large bodily movements in the course of an analysis. He was con-fronted with a choice: to ask the patient to render his feeling into words or to encourage thekicking. Reich described what he did: “I seized the opportunity and asked him to let himselfgo completely. At first he could not understand how anybody could ask him to do anythinglike that. But , . . he began to thrash around on the couch, which behavior turned into high-ly emotional yelling and inarticulate animal sounds. His actions began to assume an almostfrightening character... .”14However, Reich reasoned that this was the only avenue of approach to the patient’sdeep emotions. Only in this way was he able to relieve his infantile neurosis affectively, andnot just in the form of recollections.The meaning of all the kicking and screaming eventually became clearer to Reich.The patient was trying to provoke his parents and—through transference—Reich. When thepatient found out that in analysis he would not be punished for his tantrum-like behavior,he continued his uproar out of enjoyment. Reich recognized that emotional behavior coulditself become a resistance, a stereotyped way of acting out rather than remembering andreaching still deeper affective layers. Unlike much of modern expressive therapy, Reich waskeenly aware of the defensivefunctions emotional outbursts could often serve.The patient continued complaining about the “morass” and indirectly about Reichfor not freeing him from the bog. Reich used the technique of imitation or “mirroring.”When the patient entered the office, Reich would stand there in utter dejection. He beganto use the patient’s childish language. Sometimes he would lie on the floor and scream theway the patient did. Initially, the patient was dumbfounded, but one day he laughed in anabsolutely unneurotic fashion.Why did Reich imitate the patient? The neurotic person generally does not perceivedefensive character traits such as spitefulness as painful, the way he perceives a symptomsuch as a tic or phobia as debilitating and embarrassing. One way to facilitate his self-per-ception is to show him his behavior,or to imitate him.If this mirroring is done punitively,it can be humiliating.If it is done with some humor and warmth, it can be very illuminat-ing, as it was on the occasion reported above.* Reich now analyzed the patient’s complaints as an expression of his demand forlove. Through his misery, he would force Reich to love him. Why is the masochistic charac-ter’s demand for love so excessive? Reich suggested that the masochistic patient has anintense fear of being left alone, something he experienced with great pain in early childhood.This fear of being left alone is, in turn, related to the anxiety the masochistic character feelswhen contact with the skin ofthe beloved person is lost. Here Reich connects his own find-ings with previous observations on the role of skin eroticism. The masochist frequently fan-tasizes or acts out some kind of skin abrasion, being pinched, for example, or making theskin bleed. However, these wishes do not basically reflect a desire for pain. The patientMyron SharafFury On Earth174éditionsles atomes de l’âme*I still remember vividly the exactness, subtlety, and wit of Reich’s mimicry."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"wants to feel the warmth of the skin—“the pain is taken into the bargain.”15“The pain is taken into the bargain”—here is a key phrase in Reich’s formulationof masochism. Earlier in the case history, he reported how the patient developed fantasiesof being beaten on the buttocks. This was not primarily from desire for pain but out ofrelief that he was not being beaten on the genitals. The patient’s choice of the lesser pain isquite consistent with original psychoanalytic theory.The importance of skin excitation is an interesting emphasis of Reich’s. During thisperiod, Reich was especially concerned with events from the Oedipal and anal psychosexu-al stages; yet, with his emphasis on skin warmth, he was anticipating his later investigationsof mother-infant interactions.Another key mechanism soon became apparent during the analysis. When thepatient developed strong genital desires, his masochistic attitude sharply diminished.However, during his first sexual intercourse, he felt pain instead of pleasure. This experiencethrew him back into his “morass.”Here Reich called attention to a specific sexual mechanism: a rigidity not only in thepatient’s psyche but also in the musculature of his pelvis. This blocked any strong pleasurableturned it into pain. This spasm was connected with childhood anal and conflicts, since thefather had severely beaten the patient when he soiled his pants.In this short passage we note one of Reich’s major transition points. He is movingfrom character-analytic rigidities to bodily ones, from the character armor to the musculararmor. Within a few years, Reich’s main therapeutic attention would be devoted to thesebodily spasms or “armor segments” not only in the pelvis but throughout the body.While Reich was developing his concepts on masochism, his sex-political work wasbringing him into contact with many ardent Christians. He noted how many religiousphilosophies fitted the masochistic pattern: “The religious individual expects from God, anomnipotent figure, the relief from an inner sin, that is, an inner sexual tension: a relief whichthe individual is unable to bring about himself. Someone else has to do it—in the form ofa punishment,an absolution,a deliverance.”16As John Donne put it in his well-known son-net: “Bend your force, to breake, blowe, bum, and make me new.”What was so significant to the overall development of his work was Reich’s obser-vation of the feeling of tension, of tautness (“my penis would boil”) resulting in the desirefor, and simultaneous fear of, bursting. This phenomenon became central to his thinkingabout masochism per se and also to his entire therapeutic work. He came to believe that thismixed attitude toward bursting could be found to a greater or lesser degree in all patients.Reich’s strong opposition to death instinct theory did not please Freud or most ofthe older analysts. Moreover, while the paper on masochism was not political, other writingsby Reich during the same period clearly were. It is therefore more than probable that Reich’ssex-political activity and his clinical direction combined to provoke Freud.What also distressed Freud and other analysts was the degree of incandescentfierceness Reich brought to collegial relations concerning his work. He would insist that his14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break with the Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934175éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"associates link psychoanalytic with political (as well as social) concepts the way he did. SinceReich’s politics changed, in writing about the course of his conflicts with Freud and thePsychoanalytic Association he could retrospectively distort and minimize the political inten-sity of his message in the early 1930s. Here he followed Nietzsche’s sequence: “Memory saysI did it. Pride says I couldn’t have. Memory yields.”I also believe that Reich would have seriously considered criticism of hisCommunist politics and their relation to psychoanalysis if such criticism contained a gen-uine comprehension of his insistence on the socialaffirmation of genitality. However, hisopponents did not make these kinds of distinctions. The entangled mass of their polemicsstruck at his enduring concepts as well as at their time-bound appendages.In any case, in January 1932, Freud as editor of the International Journal ofPsychoanalysisplanned to add a prefatory note to accompany Reich’s article on masochism.The note warned readers of the Journalthat Reich was a member of the Communist Partyand that its members were not permitted to deviate from its doctrine17.According to Reich, some German Socialist physicians prevented the publication ofthis note. According to Ernest Jones, “the theme of ... [Reich’s] paper was the ‘amalgama-tion of Marxism and psychoanalysis’ ”18; a summary wildly wrong since the paper doesnot mention anything political. It is amazing how many writers have picked up on the impli-cations of what Freud and Jones thought about the article. Some have even gone so far asto say that Reich believed the death instinct was a “product of capitalism.” He believednothing so idiotic. In his sex-political writings, what he did hope was that the sex-affirma-tive direction of the Soviet Union in the 1920s would eventually lead to the prevention ofthe neuroses and, with it, of a primary masochism and sadism (the death instinct). And atthat time (ca. 1932) Reich believed that a consistent sexual affirmation was incompatiblewith capitalism or, for that matter, with feudalism.In the article on masochism,Reich’s argument was presented on strictly theoreticaland clinical grounds and should have been answered in the same way. However, if Freud’stendentious use of a political argument (Reich’s membership in the “Bolshevik Party”) wasremarkable, equally remarkable was the fact that he permitted publication of the paper at all.In view of the many attacks on Freud as an intolerant dictator, it is striking evidence to thecontrary that he could publish a paper directly challenging a concept quite dear to him.Freud’s critical attitude toward Reich stimulated or permitted others to take a harshview of him as unorthodox not only in his social but also in his clinical views. Thus, duringOctober 1932,in the midst ofthe German Communist Party’s attacks on Reich’s book onyouth, Max Eitingon, director of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society, asked Reich to limit hisseminar to practicing analysts and not permit candidates to attend19.Aware that this limitation undermined his status as a senior analyst, Reich refusedto obey the request. But this trouble was only part of the gathering storm. When Reichreturned to Vienna in March 1933, Freud informed him, as we have seen, that the psycho-analytic publishing house would not bring out his book on character analysis. After ReichMyron SharafFury On Earth176éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"gave a lecture before the Socialist students in Vienna, Federn wrote him in April asking thathe not lecture any more before Socialist or Communist groups. Federn was undoubtedlyreflecting Freud’s concern about Reich’s radical politics. A few weeks earlier the ChristianSocialist, authoritarian, yet anti-Nazi regime of Engelbert Dollfuss, which Freud supported,had suspended parliamentary government, prohibited demonstrations, and curtailed free-dom of the press. A number of Freud’s students and patients were dismayed by his endorse-ment of a party so opposed to much of what psychoanalysis represented. However, Freud,almost eighty and very ill, had become increasingly conservative in his social outlook.Reich refused Federn’s request, though he did agree to consult with the executivecommittee of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association before accepting further speaking invi-tations. But this concession was not good enough: Fedem wanted a binding promise. Reichrefused and asked for a written communication on the matter. (Reich always had an eye onthe written record.) Federn told Reich he could no longer attend the meetings of the ViennaPsychoanalytic Association. Federn also said to Annie Reich that were he, Federn, in Reich’sposition, he would have long since resigned20.In order to settle the issue, Reich proposed a discussion before the executive com-mittee. A meeting took place on April 21, 1933. According to his own account, Reichoffered to refrain from publishing and lecturing on political matters provided that theVienna Association took an official position on his views. Reich asked that the Associationeither explicitly dissociate itself from his social concepts or give him the same freedom itgave to other trends divergent from those of Freud. Reich did not want to be quietlysilenced or forced to resign.The April 21 meeting was inconclusive. According to Reich, the secretary of theAssociation, Anna Freud, remarked that the “powers that be” were against Reich; she, as sec-retary, would be sending him further information. That information never came21.His professional situation in Vienna was clearly untenable. A young Danish physi-cian,Tage Philipson,visited Reich in Vienna with the idea of going into analytic trainingwith him even though he was warned this might not be acceptable to the InternationalPsychoanalytic Association. Philipson told Reich that others in Denmark would like to studywith him and urged him to emigrate to that country.So Reich left Vienna in late April 1933, without his family. His marriage with Anniewas over, though they were not divorced. He traveled to Copenhagen by freighter, arrivingon May 1. On May 2 a number of people were already visiting Reich’s hotel to seek therapywith him or to talk about mutual concerns. The social life was so intense that Reich movedinto a small apartment.Enmity as well as enthusiastic support was not long in coming. In addition toReich’s difficulties with the Danish Communists, he was soon under attack from govern-ment officials, who had only given him a six-month visitor’s permit.One of the first people to seek treatment from Reich in Copenhagen was a hyster-ical patient who had previously made several suicide attempts. Reich told her that he wouldsee her for a few diagnostic sessions; at the end of this period, he referred her to one of his14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break with the Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934177éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Danish students. Several days later, he heard that she was in a psychiatric hospital becauseof attempted suicide. The hospital psychiatrists declared the attempt “the result of treat-ment,” and turned the case over to the Danish police. They also recommended that Reich’svisa not be extended.As a result of the hospital psychiatrists’ opposition, a Danish newspaper onOctober 29 called for Reich’s expulsion from the country, in order “to prevent one of theseGerman so-called sexologists from fooling around with our young men and women andconverting them to this perverse pseudoscience.”22Meanwhile, an analytic student of Reich’s, Erik Carstens, had written Freud seekingto enlist the master’s aid on behalf of Reich. In his reply of November 13, Freud acknowl-edged Reich’s stature as an analyst but stated that his political ideology interfered with hisscientific work. He refused to join Carstens’ appeal to the Minister of Justice23.So, on December i, Reich had to leave Copenhagen. He decided to settle temporar-ily in Malmo, Sweden. His Danish students planned to hire a boat and commute across thethree-mile strait, and students also were to come from Oslo. Reich’s library and pressremained in Copenhagen.Soon after he arrived in Malmo, early in January 1934, the Swedish authoritiesbecame suspicious of Reich. The police watched the boardinghouse where he resided. Hiscommuting students were intercepted and taken to police headquarters for questioning.Police in Denmark and in Sweden synchronized their activities. Thus, on the same day inApril, Philipson’s home in Copenhagen was searched while he was in Malmo and Reich’srooms were scrutinized by the Swedish police.No charges of any kind were raised against Reich or his students. Friends of Reichorganized a letter campaign protesting his harassment in Malmo. The anthropologistBronislaw Malinowski, who was now living in London, wrote a warm letter supportingReich. Again Freud maintained his negative position, writing: “I cannot join your protest inthe affair ofDr.Wilhelm Reich.”24In late May, Reich’s visitor’s visa expired and he returned, illegally this time, toDenmark for the summer.Two aspects of Reich’s hectic movements between Denmark and Sweden shouldbe underscored. The Danish campaign was the first state attack against him. Hitherto, theattacks had come from certain groups: the Social Democrats, the Communists, and—withgrowing momentum—the psychoanalysts. But starting with Denmark, each government ofthe country where he resided became embroiled in legal moves against him.Secondly, we should note Reich’s striking ability to gather around him immediatelya stimulating and capable group of people. R. L. Leunbach, a leader of the World Leaguefor Sexual Reform, Tage Philipson, and several other Danish followers helped Reich moveto Copenhagen.Then an aristocratic Danish woman, Ellen Siersted, joined his cause andwould later help him publish his Journal for Political Psychology and Sex-economyin I93425.In 1932 a Norwegian psychoanalyst, Nic Hoel, had studied in Berlin and becomefascinated by Reich’s work. When she returned to Oslo, she stimulated the interest of herMyron SharafFury On Earth178éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"husband, Sigurd Hoel, who was a novelist, and several other analysts. Harold Schjelderup, aprofessor at the University of Oslo, and Hoel, who both went into therapy with Reich whilehe was in Denmark, were instrumental in helping Reich move to Oslo. Thus, as so often withReich, while old ties were being disrupted, new ones were already forming.Throughout this period, Reich continued to be immensely concerned with his per-ilous position within the psychoanalytic organization. He entertained hopes that a substan-tial group of younger, Marxist-oriented analysts (such as Otto Fenichel, George Gero, thenan analytic candidate training with Reich, Karen Homey, and Edith Jacobson) would supporthis work and do battle for him and with him. Reich was aware, of course, of the difficultiesof organizing an “opposition movement.” If one espoused the cause clearly, one risked abreak with the existing organization. If one organized a new home too early, one faced thedanger of premature structuralization of still nascent concepts and techniques.Reich made use of his own struggles to understand those around him. He, too,feared “homelessness.” By 1934, however, he felt much less “organizationally bound” andmuch more prepared to accept loneliness26. He also recognized that he had put more ofhis work within the psychoanalytic and Marxist organizations than properly belonged there.Unfortunately, he would find that other Marxist-oriented analysts did not share this aware-ness.In the months before the annual International Psychoanalytic Congress, to be heldin Lucerne that August, Reich was preoccupied with the role of the opposition movement.On August 1, he received a letter from Carl Müller-Braunschweig, secretary of the BerlinPsychoanalytic Society. Reich was informed that because of the political situation, his namewould not be included on the list of German members. But, the secretary added, this wasonly a formality. The Norwegian Society was going to be recognized at the Congress and thelisting of Reich’s name in that affiliate at a future time would suffice to keep his associationmembership27.Reich was not especially upset by what seemed to be a diplomatic maneuver, eventhough he doubted that the downplaying of a controversial analyst would spare noncontro-versial ones from Hitler’s wrath (as indeed it did not). At first nothing seemed out of order.But during the evening reception, an embarrassed Müller-Braunschweig took Reich aside tosay that the German executive committee had excluded him from membership altogether;hence he was not entitled to attend the business meeting. Later, Reich was to discover thathe had been excluded from the Berlin Society a whole year earlier.Reich informed his sympathizers of what had happened; some were upset, othersminimized the incident since Reich would soon be accepted by the Norwegian group. Reichwanted his friends to refer to the controversial theoretical issues in their lectures to theCongress. However, although people such as Fenichel and George Gero dealt with subjectsthat involved Reich’s theories, all the controversy surrounding his work was ignored. Reich’shopes were dashed that a group of people would sharply and dramatically confront the oldguard. If anyone was to show the flag of the opposition, he would have to do it alone.14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break with the Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934179éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Reich could only expect enmity from most senior analysts. The one distinguishedolder analyst who had steadily endorsed him, Sandor Ferenczi, had died in 1933. Anotherold benefactor, now a bitter enemy, Paul Federn, was reported to have said: “Either Reichgoes or I go,”28Now Ernest Jones, president of the International PsychoanalyticAssociation, revealed that he had every intention of excluding Reich, contrary to what hehad said some eight months earlier. Indeed, unbeknown to Reich, Jones had been campaign-ing against him well before the Lucerne Congress. In May 1933, he wrote Anna Freud thatReich would have to choose between psychoanalysis and politics. That June, he wrote A. A.Brill, the early translator of Freud, stating that Reich was one of the troublemaking “mad-men” in psychoanalysis29.At the Congress, Reich asked Jones whether he could still deliver his scheduled lec-ture and take part in the business meeting. Jones answered that he could give his lecture asa guest but not take part in the business meeting. (The bureaucratic mills grind slowly, yetthey grind exceedingly fine.) It finally became clear to Reich that the leadership of the International Associationfully sided with the German executive committee in excluding him. He fumed against Jones’sduplicity. Talking with Heinz Hartmann, the famed analytic theorist on the adaptive mecha-nisms of the ego, and several other analysts, Reich wondered whether he should punchJones. His associates patiently advised restraint and Reich reassured them30. But in the early1950’s, or almost twenty years after Lucerne, Reich could still rage against Federn and Jones.The executive committee appointed a high-level subcommittee, which met withReich the day before the business meeting. The committee hoped to obtain Reich’s resigna-tion and thereby avoid any public unpleasantness. At the subcommittee session, Reich stat-ed that he understood his exclusion ifopposition to the death instinct concept and Freud’stheory ofculture were incompatible with membership. At the same time, he consideredhimself the legitimate developer of natural-scientific psychoanalysis and, from that view-point,could not concur with the exclusion.Jones took Reich’s recognition of the distance between his concepts and those ofpsychoanalysis in 1934 as an act ofresignation. In his biography of Freud, Jones wrote: “Itwas on this occasion [the Lucerne Congress] that Wilhelm Reich resigned from theAssociation. Freud had thought highly of him in his early days, but Reich’s political fanati-cism had led to both personal and scientific estrangement.”31Whatever Jones thought, Reich never in fact resigned. At the time, he stressed thathe was excluded from the Association. In later years, out of his hurt, he would sometimesplay down the rejection and focus on the fact that he was offered membership in theNorwegian affiliate. But, more basically, in the psychoanalytic rupture, as earlier in theCommunist one, Reich felt he could not be excluded scientifically because he himself rep-resented the true tradition. For him, the psychoanalysts, like the Communists, had removedthemselves from the living core of their heritage. He remained at the center.But for all his arguments and consoling insights, the events at Lucerne cut extreme-ly deep.What hurt Reich the most he talked least about that Freud must have approved theMyron SharafFury On Earth180éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"action, if he did not actively seek it. Several persons who spoke with Reich at Lucerne com-mented years later that he looked quite depressed. And pictures from this time show thesame hurt-brooding look revealed in the Davos photos.Depressed or not, Reich delivered one of his best papers at the Congress on August30. It was published in expanded form in May 1935 by Reich’s press as “Psychischer Kontaktund Vegetative Stromung” (“Psychic Contact and Vegetative Current”)32, and later includ-ed in the 1945 edition ofCharacter Analysis. Reich opened with the words: “After fourteenyears as a member, I speak for the first time as a guest of the Congress.” As he put it, “atten-tion was paid to me as never before. ... I had the feeling that the [Psychoanalytic Association]had excluded the theory of sexuality which formed its very core... . And now [it] spoke as aguest in the homeland... .”33Reich began his paper with a review of an older psychoanalytic concept thatformed his starting point, the social origin of neuroses. He went on to challenge deathinstinct theory directly, and then linked what appeared to be “primary masochism” in analy-sis to the patient’s unresolved negative transference.So far nothing new, though Reich in a supercharged atmosphere had publiclythrown down the gauntlet. He went on to say that “it becomes less important whether, earlyin the analysis, one obtained much or little material, whether one learned much or little aboutthe patient’s past. The decisive question came to be whether one obtained, in a correct fash-ion, those experiences which represented concentrations of vegetative energy... . The accent shift-ed from experiential content to the economy of vegetative energy.”34This is the first occasion on which, in a character-analytic context, Reich speaks of“vegetative energy,” although he had developed this theme in another paper from 1934,“Der Urgegensatz des vegetativen Lebens” (“The Basic Antithesis of Vegetative Life”)35.Characteristically, since he expected his Lucerne audience to have read this article, he felt hecould use the term “vegetative energy” without further amplification.*Reich then cited as a clinical example a patient who showed strong resistancesagainst the uncovering of his passive-homosexual fantasies. After analysis of the resistanc-es,the fantasies emerged; so, too, did signs of acute anxiety. The color of his face keptchanging from white to yellow or blue; the skin was mottled and of various tints; he hadsevere pains in the neck and occiput; the heartbeat was rapid; the patient had diarrhea. Onceagain we witness Reich in one of his favorite realms: the direct observation of very tangi-ble, clinical reactions, which express themselves in changes of color and other vivid forms.In the same paper Reich introduced another important new term, “contactless-ness.” His awareness of this phenomenon grew out of some discontent with his therapeu-14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break with the Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934181éditionsles atomes de l’âme* We should note briefly that the Berlin internist Friedrich Kraus had introduced the phrase “vegetative current”some seven years earlier in reference to fluid convection processes in the body. Around 1933, Reich had been study-ing the physiology ofbodily changes during specific emotions, such as pleasure and anxiety. Reich was often unwill-ing to explain a concept or term previously defined. I recall once suggesting that he give a brief review about someissue in a book to make it easier for the reader; he criticized me for the “socialist fallacy.” “Let them study my pre-vious writings we don’t write for people, we write about things.”"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"tic results. As he put it: “Gradually it became clear that although a thorough dissolution ofthe modes of behavior led to deep-reaching breakthroughs of vegetative energy, neverthe-less it was incomplete in a way difficult to define. One had the feeling that the patient didnot relinquish some outposts of his ‘narcissistic position.’ ”36Reich gave several common subjective perceptions of contactlessness. One was thefrequent feeling many people have of “inner loneliness” in spite of the presence of others.There was also the feeling of “inner deadness” that appears in spite of a seemingly activeand interesting existence. The phenomenon of “inner deadness” especially concernedReich. It is not an unfamiliar one to patients and to “normal” people. (More recently, themovies of Antonioni, Fellini, and Bergman, the plays of Harold Pinter and Samuel Becketthave focused on this state of nonbeing or “contactlessness.”) Certain phenomena of contactlessness appeared most vividly near the end of ther-apy. Reich distinguished here between elimination of “individual layers” of the armor andthe final breakdown of the total armor. The latter phase is often characterized by an alter-nation of what he called “streaming” (Stromung) and emotional contactlessness. By“streaming,” Reich was referring to the subjective perception of a feeling of aliveness, of acurrent flowing through the body, although he does not elaborate at this point. He went onto state as a goal oftherapy “the reestablishment of vegetative streaming The transitionfrom the streaming condition to the frozen condition is one of the most important thera-peutic and theoretical problems.”37Reich illustrated the combination of feelings of “contactlessness” and the “frozencondition” through a case example. We meet a man who is “exaggeratedly polite andreserved and somewhat dignified,” but who has a secret wish to “feel the world,” to be ableto “stream” freely with it. The patient suffered from an intense fear of object loss. He wouldreact with acute disappointment if he did not immediately have an erection when he kisseda woman. The slightest disappointment would lead him to retreat from heterosexuality.With this patient,Reich used for the first time the phrase “penis anesthesia.” By thishe meant that touching the penis resulted only in tactile but not pleasurable sensations.“Penis anesthesia” can and often does occur in the presence of erective potency. It is a vividbodily counterpart to the psychological feeling of “contactlessness.” Reich speculates that“genital anesthesia is not merely a psychic process but a disturbance of the electrophysio-logical function at the penis surface.”38* In this paper, Reich was more concerned with how the contactlessness and dead-ness came about than with how to overcome them. As he came to grips with the subject, hewas more able to acknowledge his uncertainty:How is it possible that a withdrawal of sexual excitation and outgoingness is imme-Myron SharafFury On Earth182éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Around this time Reich was planning experimental work on measuring sensations of pleasure and anxiety. Adescription of this work follows in Chapter 16.

In brief, we do not know.... The transition from full living experiencing to inner deadness is usually caused bysevere disappointments in love. However, this still does not explain the mechanismof this inner freezing up.39Fifteen years later Reich was to start an “infant research center” where the “freez-ing” process could be studied from the first day of life.Reich followed the discussion of contactlessness with an analysis of a sister con-cept, “substitute contact.” If contactlessness represents the state of inner emptiness, substi-tute contact represents the effort to connect with other people despite all the inner obsta-cles. Substitute contact is a compromise solution. Reich gives an example: “The sadistic atti-tude of the compulsive woman toward the man has not only the function of warding offher genitality but also that of compensating for the ... contactlessness and of maintainingthe contact with the original love object, although in a different form.”40Reich’s emphasis on contactlessness and substitute contact permitted a quantumadvance in his social critique. With Marx, he could indict the history of civilization. If Marxsaid that there can be no civilization until exploitation is abolished, until man’s alienationfrom his own labor is removed, Reich could join that critique and add his own: No true civ-ilization until man is in contact with his feelings and can “stream” in the world, until his con-tactlessness and his pathetic efforts at “substitute contact” are no longer necessary. In theLucerne paper, Reich was moving toward the physiological and biological, but he was alsomoving outward to the social world, to what remained one of his deepest commitments.At the Lucerne Congress the Norwegian analysts were told that if they made Reicha member, they would not be accepted as an affiliate. The Norwegians refused to accept thiscondition. However, given all the controversies and the direction of his own work, Reichwas uncertain about joining an affiliate of the International Association. And, much as hewanted the Norwegians to offer him membership,he did not wish his membership to jeop-ardize their analytic standing. He left Lucerne in the fall of 1934 and headed for Oslo, readyto begin a new phase of his career yet significantly no longer a member of any formal organ-ization.14 : The Psychoanalytic Furor and Reich’s Break with the Psychoanalytic Association: 1930-1934183éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"15 : Personal Life: 1930-1934The Berlin years proved unhappy ones for Reich’s family life. The marriage betweenAnnie and Willy, already deteriorating in Vienna, became worse in Berlin. Eva remembers“big, noisy fights” between her parents1. Even in good times the parents were very busyand the children always had to be quiet in the apartment while the Reichs saw patients. (Thecombination of living and office quarters, begun in Vienna, was carried on in Berlin.) Annie continued to participate in many of Reich’s endeavors, if without any greatenthusiasm. The income from her private practice enabled Reich to spend more time in writ-ing and political activity than might otherwise have been possible.Reich involved not only his wife but also his children in his concerns. His olderdaughter Eva,who was between six and nine during the Berlin years, recalls how her fatherused to urge her to join in the Communist marches, something she was reluctant to do. Oncewhen she was marching with a children’s group, shouting in unison: “Hunger! hunger! Giveus bread,” a passer-by noticed her and pinched her plump cheeks, saying, “You are not hun-gry!” And it was true, she thought, I am not hungry, I am lying2. As often happened withReich, he tried but failed to impose on others the enthusiasm he felt for a cause. In thisinstance, his enthusiasm backfired completely, leaving Eva with a lasting distaste for politics.A more serious family dispute concerned the children’s education. At one pointduring the Berlin years, Reich felt strongly that they should be brought up in a Communistchildren’s collective.He may also have felt this was important because Eva was sufferingfrom certain symptoms—night terrors, temper tantrums, and obsessive ideas. A collectiveeducation would ameliorate the intensity of the Oedipus complex, he believed. Annieopposed the idea but eventually gave in to pressure. So the children went to live at the col-lective; for how long is not clear, but at least one summer and for some months during theregular school year3.Eva recalls her father visiting the center. All the children were very excited abouthis new car. Time was limited and he could not take all of them for a ride in it, so he divid-ed the group in half and flipped a coin to see which children would be given a ride. Eva wasnot in the half that won, and she naturally felt very badly. As an adult she understands herfather’s thinking —he loved all children, it was a collective, fair was fair; but at the time itwas hard.Both children disliked the residential center—the poor food, the dirty living condi-tions.Lore, who was only around four at the time, left earlier than Eva. But Eva did not staylong.On a visit to her parents she walked around the apartment and argued that there wasMyron SharafFury On Earth184éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"plenty of room for her there; there was no reason for her to return to the dreadful collec-tive. As a clincher, she said: “Anyway, you are the Communist. You go live at the center. Tmstaying here.”4One of Reich’s stated reasons for moving to Berlin was to have analytic sessionswith Sandor Rado to determine whether there were any neurotic motives behind his scien-tific conflict with Freud.There are several versions of what happened in the Reich-Rado relationship.According to Annie Reich, Rado mistreated Reich by permitting him to enter therapy know-ing that he, Rado, would be moving to America six months or so after the start of treatment.However, from Rado’s account, he did not know that he was going to stay in America whenhe planned an extended vacation in 19315. It was only after his arrival in the United Statesthat the deteriorating German political situation led him to turn the trip into a permanentchange of residence.By Rado’s account again, after Reich heard of Rado’s vacation plans, he wrote thathe was stopping analysis because his sex-political responsibilities were so time-consuming.In other words, Reich would leave Rado before Rado left Reich.Reich had his own version of what happened. In his interview with Dr. Eissler, hestated: “I saw Rado several times. Nothing came of that. Rado was jealous, awfully jealous.... Emmy, his wife, and I had very strong genital contact with each other. Never anything likefull embrace happened between us, but we danced a lot together and we had very strongcontact. And Rado was jealous.”6More importantly, according to Edith Jacobson, Rado told Annie that Reich wassuffering from an “insidious psychotic process,” and advised her not to continue living withhim7.Annie rejected the diagnosis and the advice,at least for a few more years. We do notknow the context in which Rado communicated his opinion about Reich to Annie, but onthe face ofit for an analyst to vouchsafe such opinions to a patient’s mate seems thorough-ly unprofessional We do know from one other source that Rado bandied damaging diag-noses ofReich,basing his opinion by inference on his analytic experience with the man8.Reich cannot have known what Rado told Annie, for as late as 1933 he was writingRado a friendly letter from Denmark, seeking his advice about emigration to the UnitedStates. He described Rado as “among the few colleagues with good judgment.’ ”9Rado’s diagnosis of an “insidious psychotic process” completed the fateful pictureof Reich from around 1934 on: his concepts on genitality, his social views, and his person-ality were seen singly as dangerous, combined as deadly. Prior to the 1930s, some analysts,especially Federn, had called Reich a “psychopath.” However, as far as I can determine, itwas not until Rado that the diagnosis of a “psychosis” was made.According to Reich, Rado’s diagnosis was also circulated, starting around 1935, byboth Annie Reich and Otto Fenichel. Thus Reich’s former therapist, his former wife, andformer best friend were to launch with some authority a very damaging view of his person-ality. These evaluations of his personality and his work mutually reinforced each other: his“psychosis” would underlie his “erroneous” work, and his “crackpot” ideas would prove his15 : Personal Life: 1930-1934185éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"“psychosis.”In May 1932, Reich began a serious relationship with Elsa Lindenberg a relation-ship that led to the final denouement of his marriage to Annie.Born in Germany in 1906, Elsa was the youngest of five children. Her father wasa book printer, an active Social Democrat, and a man who loved music. He died when Elsawas six, so the family suffered great financial difficulties. Her mother, a sensitive person whooften read poetry to the children, had to take a job in a factory. From an early age Elsa wasinterested in dancing and was to make that her career. In 1919, when she was thirteen, anolder brother was killed in the Spartacus (Communist) uprising in Berlin. Some years later,Elsa felt committed to carrying on her brother’s work and became a Communist herself10.At the time she met Reich, Elsa was a dancer with the City Opera of Berlin as wellas a political activist. In her mid-twenties she was a strikingly attractive woman, to judgefrom various dance photographs in her Oslo apartment when I interviewed her in the19705. She had already heard about Reich, who was then thirty-five, from a friend who wasa member of the same Communist cell as Reich11. Her friend had told her that she shouldmeet Reich—he brought new ideas to politics. But, he also laughingly warned, she shouldwatch out; he was very “seductive.”Reich and Elsa first noticed each other on a train taking them to the May Daydemonstration in Berlin. She had been struck by his giving her (a total stranger) his coat tohold while he temporarily went to another carriage. Then, during the demonstration march,Elsa was looking for someone to walk with who would be good company and could alsoserve as a protector. Noticing two sympathetic-looking men, one of whom was Reich, shebegan walking with them.Elsa observed that Reich exerted a strong influence on people. When he steppedout of the row of marchers, a group would follow him. She also noticed his fury when Nazihecklers made threatening gestures. It was all he could do to restrain himself from fightingback.Elsa and Reich were strongly attracted to each other from the start. Elsa remem-bers that they put their arms around one another, more preoccupied with their growinginfatuation than with the boring speech by a Communist leader that ended the demonstra-tion.Afterward they began to see each other frequently. When Elsa learned of his marriage,she wanted to break off the relationship. Reich made it clear to her that he no longer lovedhis wife, but he was deeply upset by the prospect of separating from the children.The relationship continued to grow in intensity. It was far more serious than Reich’sprevious affairs. Reich has described Elsa as one of the few women in his life whom he trulyloved. Finally, when the break-up with Annie was becoming more and more of a reality, Elsaurgently suggested a meeting with them both to discuss the situation. (Reich had made noeffort to keep the affair secret; in fact, the word “affair” hardly describes his relationshipwith Elsa.) During part of the meeting Annie and Elsa talked alone, as Willy had steppedoutside.Later, Annie wrote a note that contained the sentence: “Your [Elsa’s] happiness willbe built on my tears.” However, when Elsa offered to withdraw because of the children,Myron SharafFury On Earth186éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Annie said bitterly that this would be of little help since if it were not Elsa there would beanother woman12.Reich and Annie did not actually live apart until they left Berlin singly for Viennaearly in March 1933. Annie stayed on in Vienna a few months, then moved to Prague, whereshe reestablished her analytic practice. Eva and Lore had left Berlin a few days before theirparents and returned to Vienna to live for almost a year with their grandparents, Alfred andMalva Pink.As with many of Reich’s separations, there was some question of who finally leftwhom. Annie’s version was that she found life with Reich intolerable, not because of hisaffairs per se but because of the way he treated her—his domineering insistence that shecompletely follow hiswork and hisways, his explosive rages, his alternating coldness and ten-derness, the quarrels about money13. Reich’s version is simple: “She was sick. I just had toleave her.”14However, when Reich was quarreling with someone, he could use the word“sick” with a meaning of his own—Annie was not a “genital character.” For some timebefore the separation and in the many years after it, she symbolized for him all that enragedhim in the analytic community, the intellectual “smugness,” the “mustiness,” the fear of the“juices oflife,” and with that fear, the fear and hatred, however politely wrapped up, of hisown work15.Lia Laszky, who visited Berlin in 1932, conveys some of the tensions between Willyand Annie in the last years of their marriage. Willy, Annie, Fenichel, and the two childrenwere taking a trip through the German countryside, and Willy invited Lia along. But hebecame furious when his car kept on stalling en route. Eva was getting very upset and theatmosphere was tense and charged. During a stop, Fenichel took Lia aside to say that he hadgone along in order to testify about Reich’s behavior at a possible divorce proceeding Annieplanned.“And you want me to testify, too?” Lia asked. Fenichel nodded. Lia decided imme-diately to leave the group. She told Reich of her intention without giving the reason for it.Even more upset,he begged her not to leave, saying that it would turn out to be a good trip.When she insisted, he became angry. Then, at the next train stop—not the one she wouldhave chosen—he let her out. Characteristically, if someone was planning to leave Reich, hewould reverse the situation so that he determined the parting.Reich’s separation from Annie opened the way for living with Elsa. However, muchas Elsa was in love with Reich, she was hesitant about leaving Germany. For one thing, shewas active in the movement against Hitler. For another, her professional independence wasimportant to her:she had a good career in Germany, and was uncertain of her opportuni-ties outside the country. Reich partly supported her aspirations, but typically also wanted herto center her life around him.Between March and May 1933, Reich bombarded Elsa with letters urging her tojoin him in Vienna.He also persuaded their mutual friends to encourage Elsa to take thestep. Eventually, she joined him in Copenhagen in late May.In spite ofall his difficulties with the Communists, the International Association,and the state authorities in Denmark,in spite ofhis pain over separation from his children,15 : Personal Life: 1930-1934187éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"once they were together, Reich was very happy with Elsa. Elsa has given a vivid descriptionof him:I realized how strong his love for humanity was and how he could sufferfor and with others. But he could also be happy as I have never known anyone tobe—his sensitivity, his sensuousness, his ability to register the feelings of others.He was aware of his gifts and he knew he had an outstanding contributionto make. But he was also afraid for himself, afraid of where his development mighttake him. At times he believed that he would achieve fame and recognition in hislife time; in other moods he feared that he would go “kaput,” that his life wouldend tragically in one way or another.Sometimes at night when he couldn’t sleep he would speak to me abouthis fears, including the fear he might go mad. He also spoke to me about his guiltover feeling responsible for his mother’s death.Just as Reich could share his hopes and fears with Elsa, he could also share joy andsimple fun. They loved to dance together. In Elsa, he found a woman who could participateenthusiastically in his growing interest in the emotional expression of the body and in thephenomenon of muscular armor. She also shared his intense political commitments, whichremained strong during this time. As Elsa put it, “We were devoted Communists, very dis-ciplined.” She added ruefully, “What idiots we were!”Those close to Reich, and especially the woman he lived with, had to share his inter-ests. Annie had been an enthusiastic student and practitioner of analysis in the years whenthis was at the center of Reich’s life; but she had barely gone along with his sex-political con-cerns and his development of the orgasm theory. Lia Laszky was more involved in the polit-ical arena, but she was not prepared to leave the psychoanalytic framework or professionalmilieu,For both Annie and Lia, Freud was the last word, and anything Reich (or others) hadto add were but refinements to a basic text. Both women came from upper-middle-classViennese families and were highly educated.Elsa was different. Coming from a working-class background, she had knownpoverty,and,like Reich, had been on her own from an early age. She had never studied psy-choanalysis, although she was interested in—and a quick learner of—those aspects of analy-sis that especially appealed to Reich. Her education had been in the dance, not academic. Shewas a freer spirit and a warmer person than either Annie or Lia. Finally, she spoke of Reichwith more love than any other woman who knew him that I interviewed.* One anecdote illustrates how,in Elsa’s company, Reich continued to combine hisscientific and private interests. In Copenhagen, he and Elsa liked to visit the Tivoli Gardensamusement park. There they would observe people’s reactions to the roller coaster ride: theiranxiety,terror, pleasure. Around this time in his therapeutic work, Reich was concentratingMyron SharafFury On Earth188éditionsles atomes de l’âme*I never met Annie Reich, who died in 1971, so my views of her are based on accounts from others."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"on his patients’ “fear of falling,” a fear that often became prominent during the final stagesof therapy when orgasm anxiety was strong. He connected the fear of falling with the fear“of the typical sensations in the diaphramatic region which are experienced on a roller coast-er or in a suddenly descending elevator.”16After the clash with Danish officialdom in the fall of 1933, Reich decided to take afour-week vacation in early December. He wanted to visit London, which he was consider-ing as a possible permanent residence; to see his children in Austria; and to visit friends inother European cities. This month’s sojourn was the only time Reich traveled widely not outof necessity but choice.In London, he met Bronislaw Malinowski for the first time. A friendship begunthrough letters was now enhanced by personal contact. In his book Der Einbruch derSexualmoral(The Invasion of Compulsory Sex-morality), published in 193217, Reich had made useof Malinowski’s findings about the Trobrianders to postulate that patriarchy, sex negation,and a class division had long ago “invaded” the natural state of matriarchy, sex affirmation,and primitive communism. At that time Maiinowski was one of the few academic scholarswho thought highly of Reich’s writings.Reich’s visit with Ernest Jones was less successful. Among other factors contribut-ing to Jones’s dislike of Reich was the latter’s personal and intellectual closeness toMaiinowski. Jones and the anthropologist were then engaged in divisive polemics about theuniversality of the Oedipus complex.The ever correct Jones invited Reich to present his views at a meeting of Englishanalysts. According to Reich, the atmosphere of the meeting held in Jones’s home was oneof rigid formality. Reich stressed the social origin of the neuroses, a view that met withvague agreement qualified by Jones’s insistence on a strict separation between science andpolitics. Nonetheless, Jones privately told Reich that he would strongly oppose any move toexpel Reich from the Psychoanalytic Association. However, after meeting with Jones, Reichrelinquished any idea ofa move to London18.In Paris, Reich met with several officials of Leon Trotsky’s Fourth International, themilitant but tiny Marxist organization in opposition to Stalin’s “state capitalism” as well asto private capitalism. Yet the officials could see no practical place for Reich’s concepts intheir political work19.Reich also attended meetings of German radical refugees in Paris. He found theseradicals still happily talking about “categories of class consciousness,” without seriously con-sidering the implications ofHitler’s victory for their concepts and activities. Irritated andspurred by the scholastic discussion, he returned to his hotel room and outlined what laterbecame his masterful article, “What Is Class Consciousness?” (see page XXX, chap 13).Reich next went to Zurich, where he saw an old friend, the sexologist and politicalradical Fritz Brupbacher, author of40 Jahre Ketzer(Forty Years a Heretic),which Reich consid-ered to be a “brilliant account of Philistinism in the workers’ movement.”20Brupbacher’sdeep concern for people and decades of involvement with social struggles “fascinated”Reich—and Reich did not report being fascinated by many people. At this meeting,15 : Personal Life: 1930-1934189éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Brupbacher was profoundly discouraged about the present and future of humanity. Reichshared his diagnosis but not his prognosis.From Zurich, Reich went to the Tyrol in the Austrian Alps to see his children atChristmas time. Eva and Lore were now attending a Viennese private school directed byMargaret Fried, a friend of Annie’s. Mrs. Fried and her husband had a home in the Tyrolwhere pupils could, if they wished, spend summers and Christmas vacations.Some thirty-five years later, Mrs. Fried remembered the Reich of the Tyrol visit wellas being “friendly and liberal”21She noted that he was an excellent skier, with a mobile bodymore like a man of twenty-five than thirty-five. He had good contact with the schoolchild-ren and some vacationing adolescents. Lore, then almost six, tended to cling to her father.Eva, almost ten, was concerned whether people liked “Willy,” as she called him. Her disqui-et here undoubtedly reflected the growing bitter schism, to be described in Chapter 19,between her father and his world and Annie, her grandfather, and the analytic community.Annie also came to the Frieds’ for Christmas. According to Reich, there was no hintof the acrimony that “later devastated our lives.”22However, Reich could overlook signs oftrouble when he preferred not to see them. In Mrs. Fried’s view, Annie was embarrassed anddispleased by Reich’s presence—something of a surprise—on her turf. Mrs. Fried did criti-cize Reich for being “too outspoken” on sexual matters. A few of the adolescents presenthad read his book The Sexual Struggle of Youth, and they seized the opportunity to discuss itwith the author in person. His answers to their questions were frank and the discussion spir-ited. Mrs. Fried and her husband were disturbed because some of the pupils were from con-servative, Catholic homes. At one point Mrs. Fried took Reich aside and said that the stu-dents’ parents would be very upset if they should hear about this kind of conversation.Reich said he hadn’t realized the difficulties and subsequently desisted from such exchanges.After Christmas Reich went on to Vienna, where he stayed with friends. Some sixweeks later the Dollfuss government would raid the Socialist headquarters there and theSocialist leaders would be forced to flee or be arrested.Reich, who predicted this outcome,heard friends and colleagues still mouth their old positions:the Communists were preparedfor the revolution and the Social Democrats believed that compromises would avert disas-ter.What had happened in Germany could not happen in Austria. Later, visiting friends inPrague, he noted the same kind of illusions—in this case, about Hitler’s overthrow by theChurch, the Western powers, the German Army, and, “of course, the increasingly matureworkers in the factories.”23To avoid a long trip back to Sweden through Poland, Reich traveled by way ofGermany after ascertaining that no lists of names were kept at the border. He made astopover in Berlin: “Soldiers everywhere. Depression, sluggish movements, anxious peer-ing.” He thought he recognized a former Communist comrade but was uncertain whetherto greet him.Many Communists had become Nazis now. Reich wondered about the worthof convictions: How did it happen that a person could be passionately for one doctrine andthen suddenly just as fervently support a radically different ideology?24Reich’s journey through Europe gives another vivid example of how he lived with-Myron SharafFury On Earth190éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"out any strict separation between work and leisure. Always he was observing and makingconnections between these observations and the themes of his work. Then, too, the itiner-ant Reich reveals—like the Reich of the 1927 Vienna demonstrations—his sensitive barom-eter for group moods* His weathervane registered clearly the subdued, appeasing mood inEurope, gripped by hopeful illusions, after Hitler’s rise to power and the Stalinization ofRussia, and before the Holocaust and World War II.During the stopover Reich met Elsa, who had been visiting family and friends inBerlin while he traveled. Not well known as a Communist, she could still move freely inGermany. Together, they returned to Sweden. On arriving in Malmo in January 1934 theytook rooms in a boardinghouse, the atmosphere of which Reich described as frigid andstuffy, with people staring intrusively at Elsa and himself25. Both of them spoke German,and, in addition, word may have gotten around that this unusual couple were not married.Still, Reich thought, it was better than being in a concentration camp.With the help of Reich’s students, Elsa commuted to Copenhagen, where she spentseveral days a week continuing her dance work. Reich had ample leisure for study and writ-ing in addition to seeing patients. He also had the opportunity to observe life in a relativelysmall city, a new experience for him. He found Malmo to be a quite unpretentious place,where “civilization could sleep in ‘law and order.’ ” At night adolescents walked to and froin the streets, separated by sex, and giggling at each other.With his Swedish visa due to expire in late May and the authorities suspicious andunwilling to renew it, Reich and Elsa decided to spend the summer of 1934 illegally inSletten, Denmark, where Reich lived under the pseudonym Peter Stein. They planned to set-tle in Oslo in the fall.Eva and Lore, who visited Reich and Elsa that summer, both recalled that Reichwas much happier in Denmark than he had been in Berlin. Eva, too, contrasted the gray,tight atmosphere of her life in Vienna with the joyous summer in Denmark: “It was light,fun, jolly. There were trips, eating out, people dancing, people coming and going fat Fenicheland others.It was alive.”26In Denmark, Reich brought Eva more into his work than he had done in the past.She happily recalled his discussing his current interests with her and permitting her to attendinformal seminars at a small congress he was organizing. Lore described this kind of behav-ior on Reich’s part more negatively: he made no distinction between children and adults.Eva, in particular, he treated in a way that was beyond her years, a criticism later vehement-ly repeated by Annie and her friends.Eva remembered a journey by car from Denmark to the Lucerne Congress inSwitzerland in August 1934. They camped out along the way through Germany, for Reichloved camping. There were memories of dancing with Elsa, the smell of honeysuckle allaround them; of free bodies exercising, and of bathing in the nude; of Reich being tenderto Elsa in a way Eva rarely remembered his being with her mother. All these evocations ofwhat must have been a golden summer for Eva created antagonism in others. One personmentioned with strong distaste that Reich sent his daughters a photo taken during the trip15 : Personal Life: 1930-1934191éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"to Lucerne showing Elsa and Eva dancing, both nude to the waist27.At Lucerne the “family” continued to camp out, now by the lake near where theCongress was held. This, too, led to stories. In discussing those days with Dr. Eissler, Reichmentioned that he didn’t like hotels, and, besides, it would have been difficult for him to livein one with Elsa since they were not married. Reich went on to say that he lived with Elsain a tent at Lake Lucerne. He also had a camping knife with him. Out of these facts the high-ly distorted rumor later circulated that he had been psychotic, wore a dagger, and lived in atent in the lobby of a hotel28.People interpreted the story as further evidence of how far Reich had gone astray.Grete Bibring, his student friend, saw it as another sign of his sinking into psychosis. Eissler,who assigned the diagnosis of psychopathic rather than psychotic to Reich, used the storyto show how wantonly provocative Reich could be, considering how conservative the Swisswere at that time29. And various interviewees referred to Elsa as “Reich’s concubine” or“Reich’s dancer,” much as one might speak of a kind of prostitute.Whatever the interpretation, Reich’s relationship with Elsa in general and hisappearance with her at Lucerne in particular fanned the outrage against him. There were sci-entific and political differences between Reich and many analysts, but there were alsointensely personal reasons for other analysts to resent him. For him to appear with Elsa,when Annie was also attending the Congress, exacerbated the family quarrel aspect of thewhole imbroglio. Many analysts who were Annie’s good friends as well as Reich’s took herside in the dispute. By all accounts, they regarded her as a very kind, gentle, intelligent per-son, much abused by Reich. She advanced no controversial theories, she was not an embar-rassment to them, and, as they saw it, she was the injured party.All ofthis was conveyed rather than explicitly stated in interviews. Most partici-pants intellectually held an “enlightened viewpoint”:one did not blame a husband or wifefor having affairs, or for leaving a marriage. Analysts did have affairs and did divorce, with-out a cause celèbre.But somehow Reich was different. From his viewpoint, he was more open;from theirs, he was provocative and indiscreet. Everything Reich did had a quality of beingunderlined,a kind ofglamour and dash ifone liked it, a note of wanton provocation if onedidn’t. He was not just a Communist, he was a militant one; he was not just a psychoanalyst,he claimed to be thecontinuer of the vital tradition within psychoanalysis; he did not dis-creetly have an affair, he openly avowed his love. Nor would he curb his freedom even if theSwiss—or the analysts—did not like his living with a woman not his legal wife in a tent bythe lake.From today’s viewpoint it is easy to forget how conservative the average middleclass was in the 1930s in Europe—and America. Even in Denmark, supposedly one of thecenters of sexual permissiveness, the atmosphere then was quite puritanical. Sexual relationswere fully appropriate only within marriage; maybe, it was not so terrible if an engaged cou-ple had intercourse. But the taboos against open discussion of sexuality and open relation-ships outside marriage were very strong. And it is worth underscoring that the analytic com-munity as a groupwas not so different in its outlook from society generally.Myron SharafFury On Earth192éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"In the previous chapter Reich’s break with the psychoanalytic organization was dis-cussed largely in terms of the scientific disagreements and the “opposition movement.”Here it is important to emphasize how bitter was Reich’s personal disappointment that sofew colleagues and friends supported him at the Lucerne showdown. Once theanalyst rec-ommended to many American students, he had plummeted to one with hardly any backingas he faced exclusion.The older analysts were either for his exclusion or quite willing to go along withthose who sought this step. However, next to the rejection by Freud, the worst blow forReich was the passivity on the part of the younger group of analysts, many of them hisfriends. Grete Bibring felt that she should remove herself from the dispute precisely on thegrounds that, as a friend of Reich, she was insufficiently neutral30. Edith Jacobson, whoshared so much with Reich in Berlin, felt that she was too young an analyst to carry anyweight in the proceedings31. I have little information about what Fenichers precise actionsat Lucerne were. According to Reich, Fenichel submitted a “lame resolution” at the businessmeeting, most probably on behalf of Reich since it was quickly tabled32. Only Nic Hoelmade a spirited speech in Reich’s defense.After Reich’s exclusion, Anna Freud reportedly said: “A great injustice has beendone here.”33But she herself took no steps to prevent its passage. (A few years later, whensomeone asked for her opinion of Reich, she was to say: “A genius or ... ,” her pause indi-cating that the concluding word was “madman.”)*34With the exception of the Scandinavian group and all the members of this group—were new friends,not old ones—there was no one who came to Reich’s aid when he mostneeded it,after the many years of comradeship and recognition in Vienna and Berlin. It isnot surprising that he later spoke of this lack of support as “the hardest blow of my scien-tific career”(and this was said in 1945 when,from other perspectives, far more dangerousevents had occurred)35.After the Congress, Reich and Elsa left for Oslo. The children returned to theirgrandparents in Vienna.Annie went back to Prague, where she lived with ThomasRubinstein, a former official in Alexander Kerensky’s short-lived 1917 Russian government,whom she would later marry.A dour,compulsive man, he was disliked by Eva and Lore, inpart because he worked at home on research and insisted on quiet and perfect order. Willyand he loathed one another, Thomas referring to Reich as “the skunk.”36Annie appears tohave chosen a second husband who was the opposite ofReich save in his capacity to hate.It is difficult to tell how Annie felt about Reich’s exclusion from the analytic organ-ization at the time. There were fights and tensions between them at Lucerne. Not long afterthe Congress, Annie would say that Willy could only tolerate close relations with people who15 : Personal Life: 1930-1934193éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Reich may well have been especially disappointed over Anna Freud’s lack of support for him at Lucerne. I recallhis pleasure when he mentioned several times in the 1950s that during the twenties she had once sent him a post-card in which she described him as a spintus rector (“inspiring teacher”)."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"were in thrall to him (hörig), as she felt she had been for many years37. Judging from herlater career as a totally orthodox Freudian analyst, one can only imagine that part of her wasvery glad to be done with him, not to mention those concepts of his she had followed moreout of submissiveness than genuine conviction. Now that Reich had been rejected by—andin many ways had rejected—his “second home,” the psychoanalytic organization, the onlyremaining objective tie between them was their children. However, Annie had deeply caredfor Reich, and subjectively the repercussions of the relationship would continue for a longtime, as we shall see.In the course of a year and a half, then, Reich had endured significant partings fromthe Communist Party, the International Psychoanalytic Association, and Annie Reich. Ineach case, the ruptures were many years in the making. In each case, there was some ques-tion as to how much Reich was cast out and how much he himself determined the finale.Later, Reich sometimes spoke of the suffering the familial separation had causedhim not only because of the children but also because of the loss of Annie. At other times,he could speak of her with great bitterness. For him, as for Annie, the process of separa-tion involved much more than leaving, and it took its toll. However, Reich’s greatest empha-sis was on how crucial it had been for his work that he didleave, that he did not “get stuck”as so many people did—stuck in outdated concepts, stuck in organizations needed for secu-rity, stuck in neurotic patterns, and stuck in marriages they were unable to leave. He espe-cially cited Freud and Federn as men in this position38.For Reich, to leave a no longerviable relationship was as important as any step he took to preserve the integrity of his lifeand work.The costs, however, were great. Reich always tended to underestimate his own con-tribution to the unhappiness connected with his disrupted relationships. Two sad children,feeling abandoned by both parents, were part of that cost. And no amount of later angerand blame toward Annie could completely assuage Reich’s guilt over the pain and sufferingof his children. In 1934, two paths diverged. Reich chose the less traveled one—both in hiswork and in his personal life.Myron SharafFury On Earth194éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"PART VIFirst Steps on the Road to Life Reich’s Experimental Workin Scandinavia: 1934-1939195éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"16 : The Bio-electrical Experiments: 1934-1935In 1934, Reich began his natural-scientific experiments. Before dealing with thisquite controversial subject, I should make clear that my own competence for evaluating hisscientific work is not as advanced as it is for dealing with his psychiatric and sociologicalwork. In addition, there is very little to draw on in making critical assessments of this workthat is not either fulsomely positive, hence inadequate, or contemptuously negative, manywriters having dismissed Reich’s experiments as absurd prima facie.I shall limit myself then to a brief account of Reich’s scientific experiments, pre-senting the major arguments, pro and con, which have been advanced by others. Moreimportantly, my aim is to show the overall theoretical framework within which his scientificwork developed and how this research influenced his psychiatric and social endeavors.No longer a member of the psychoanalytic organization or the Communist Party,Reich was now freer to pursue his research without having to look over his shoulder to seewhat Freud or the party leaders thought about it. His social interests remained strong andvigorously expressed in his quarterly, established this year, the Journal for Political Psychology andSex-economy. However, his sex-political efforts were not welcome in any political organiza-tion. By 1934, the physiological emphasis of Reich’s therapeutic work was becoming increas-ingly important: the investigation of the streamings of energy (libido) in pleasure; thereverse movement of that energy in anxiety; and the muscular spasms which, along with thecharacter armor, prevented the free emotional expression of the organism. But Reich wasnot content simply to progress further in his therapeutic technique. He also wished to provehis own concepts and, with them, Freud’s early hypothesis of the libido, in a demonstrable,quantitative way1.He wanted to provide the biological foundation for psychoanalysis thatFreud had predicted, even though Freud himself had abandoned his early efforts to linkanalysis with physiology.Crises had a way of stimulating Reich to further advances. As in the late 1920s,when he had combined various concepts and findings from Freud, Marx, and Malinowskito create his sex-politics and to oppose the more conservative social directions of Freud andpsychoanalysis, so now, in another furor intellectualis, Reich drew upon findings by Freud, andby the physiologist L. R. Müller, the internist Friedrich Kraus, and the biologist MaxHartmann, in a synthesizing effort that cut across different fields and paved the way for sub-sequent experimentation2.From analysis, Reich turned once again to Freud’s early notion of “actual neu-Myron SharafFury On Earth196éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"roses.” In his clinical and social work, Reich had been concerned with the relationshipbetween actual neuroses and psychoneuroses. In 1934, his attention moved to a basicresearch question: the nature of pleasure and of anxiety. Interestingly enough, in 1926 Freudhad said that the physiological “stuff “ of which anxiety was made had lost its interest forhim. Characteristically, Reich picked up a question Freud had dropped. And he did so in aneffort to affirm the younger Freud against the older Freud and the analytic establishmentthat had just expelled Reich.In 1931, L. R. Miiller had published the third edition ofDie Lebensnerven(TheNervous System), in which he summarized the functions of the two major divisions of theautonomic nervous system: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic3. The autonomic sys-tem operates outside consciousness, unlike the central nervous system, which includes thebrain and the spinal cord. The autonomic nervous system activates the cardiovascular, diges-tive, sexual, and respiratory organs. The sympathetic division responds to dangerous orthreatening situations by preparing a person through anxiety for “flight or fight” reactions;the parasympathetic division controls the same life-sustaining organs of the body underdanger-free, relaxed conditions.Some examples of how particular organs respond to sympathetic or parasympa-thetic activation are: sympathetic—accelerated heartbeat, increased blood pressure, con-stricted blood vessels, increased inspiration in breathing, and reduced blood supply to thegenitals; parasympathetic—slow and full heart action, decreased blood pressure, dilatedblood vessels, stimulation of expiration, and increased blood supply to the genitals.Reich was so impressed by Miiller’s organization of autonomic nerve responses thathe began to see the task of therapy as one of reversing the “general sympatheticotonic con-traction of the organism.” In other words, he wanted to combat not the acute emergencyreaction of fear but the chronic anxiety (and the defense against it) that continued long afterthe stimulus had vanished. Thus, for example, the child once held his breath to inhibit gen-ital excitations that got him into trouble with his parents. As an adult he continued, throughearly conditioning,to hold his breath,even though this response crippled his capacity forpleasurable functioning.To my knowledge, Reich was the first psychoanalyst to emphasize the role of sym-pathetic response in neurotic illness. It is interesting to note that current bio-feedback tech-niques often involve the replacement of anxiety states with calmer ones by conditioning thepatient to relaxing (parasympathetic) thoughts and feelings. The puzzling successes of faithhealing and the “placebo effect” may work on the same principle, stimulating hope(parasympathetic innervation) and reducing anxiety (sympathetic response).It should be stressed that Reich’s therapy, unlike bio-feedback techniques, did notaim at the avoidance of anxiety states. On the contrary, the binding of anxietyin the armorwas more of a problem than free-floating anxiety itself. Intense anxiety was often arousedin the course of therapy as the armor loosened. The patient was helped to work through hisanxiety states,not avoid them. The cardinal therapeutic problem became the fear of intenseemotions and, in particular, the fear of strong pleasurable sensations (what Reich termed16 : The Bio-electrical Experiments: 1934-1935197éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"“pleasure anxiety”).Through the work of two Germans, the biologist Max Hartmann and a zoologist,Ludwig Rhumbler, Reich was able to relate his two basic directions of energy flow—“toward the world” in pleasure and “away from the world” in anxiety—to the movementsof the amoeba. In a series of experiments, Hartmann and Rhumbler exposed amoebae to avariety of stimuli (chemical, mechanical, thermical, electrical, and optical). Depending uponthe quantity and quality of these stimuli, the amoebae reacted in one of two ways: either theysought these stimuli (moved toward them), or they avoided them and assumed a sphericalshape (“played dead”).The two researchers had also found internalmovements in the form of fluid cur-rents within the amoeba. Plasma currents toward the surface of the amoeba were accompa-nied by the active approach of the amoeba toward the object (corresponding to what in thehuman would be called a parasympathetic response). Conversely, the movements away fromthe world were accompanied by plasma currents from the surface toward the center (analo-gously, a sympathetic response).Finally, when the amoeba was at rest, the investigators noted pulsating movementsin the form of a rhythmic alternation of expansion and contraction. The movement ofexpansion was accompanied by plasma currents from the center to the surface; those ofcontraction by currents from the surface to the center.Hartmann and Rhumbler’s research permitted Reich to add a further polarity tothose of pleasure and anxiety, parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation: the polarity ofplasma currents from the center to the surface in “outgoing” amoeba responses, from thesurface to the center in “withdrawing” reactions.Another major influence on Reich during the same period was Friedrich Kraus. Hisbook Allgemeine und Spezielle Pathologic der Person(General and Special Pathology of the Person), pub-lished in 1926, presented data showing that living substances consisted essentially of colloidsand mineral salts,both of which when dissolved in body fluids were electrolytes; this meantthat bio-electricity was present4,Kraus considered the biosystem to be a relay-like switchmechanism ofelectrical charge (storing of energy) and discharge (performance of work).For our purposes it is sufficient to emphasize that Reich drew especially uponKraus’s focus on the movement of electrical charges within the organism. Reich also madeuse of some studies of plant physiology, which revealed a significant connection betweenfluid movements and electrical discharge processes.The most important antecedent to Reich’s experimental work was his own study ofthe function ofthe orgasm5.Clinically,as we have noted, he had long been impressed bythe fact that mechanical sexual processes (such as erection and ejaculation in the male) couldoccur without strong sensations of pleasure. Clinically, too, he had been concerned with alle-viation of this condition. Now he wanted to move toward laboratory investigation: Whathad to move, what had to be present beyond known processes, for pleasure to be experi-enced? Several lines of thought influenced Reich to hypothesize that bio-electrical process-Myron SharafFury On Earth198éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"es were involved in the flow of sexual pleasure. As we have noted, he had been impressedwith Kraus’s bio-electrical model of the organism. Secondly, he noted the popular idea of akind of “electricity” between a man and a woman who are attracted to each other. (Reichtended to take quite seriously everyday expressions for energetic or emotional processeswithin or between people.) Third, he had commented that moisture, a conductor of electric-ity, played an important role in sexuality: “There is an almost irresistible urge for completecontact between the two organ surfaces when the erect male organ touches the moistmucous membrane of the vagina... .”6Reich now returned to two old observations, but from a new angle: slow, gentle fric-tional movements during intercourse produced much stronger sensations than harsh, rapidmovements; and after orgasm, the genital became refractory to any further excitations. Fromthese observations, Reich hypothesized that the orgasm represented a form of electrical dis-charge. Then he went on to make one of his bold leaps: he described a four-part processwhich, in his view, characterized not only the orgasm but also cell division (mitosis). Thisprocess, which he termed the “orgasm formula” or the “life formula,” consisted of foursteps:(1) Mechanical tension(filling ofthe organs with fluid; tumescence, withincreased turgor of tissues generally).(2) The mechanical tension associated with an increase ofbio-electricalcharge.(3) Dischargeof the accumulated bio-electrical charge through spontaneousmuscular contractions.(4) Flowing back of the body fluids: detumescence (mechanical relaxation).I have intentionally lingered on Reich’s preparations for experimentation, for sev-eral reasons. First, this period around 1934 is a nice example of the gradual evolution of hiswork,an evolution that is in contrast to the popular image of his sudden leap from psycho-analysis and libido theory into grandiose notions about orgone energy. On the contrary,between libido theory and his orgone energy concepts lay six years when his thought andexperimentation were based on an electrical model of sexual functioning.Second, the period I have discussed illustrates well the synthesizing qualities ofReich’s mind and his particular attraction to the convergence of independent work from dif-ferent fields for his own goals. He was now drawing on the work of Freud and otherresearchers for his own ends, just as in the early 1920s he had used the work of Freud,Ferenczi,and Abraham to develop character analysis. In reviewing the work of others, Reichdid not provide a critique, unless circumstances compelled him to do so as in the case ofFreud. He was, for example, impatient with the controversies surrounding Kraus’s concepts,so much so that he does not tell us what they were. What Maxim Gorki wrote of Tolstoywas also true ofReich: “When you speak to Tolstoy of things which he can put to no use,he listens with indifference and incredulity... . Like a collector of valuable curios, he only col-16 : The Bio-electrical Experiments: 1934-1935199éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"lects things which are in keeping with the rest of his collection.”7Finally, Reich’s reactions to crises are significant here. The period around 1934 pro-duced more numerous, if not more dangerous, ones than any other comparable span of hislife. There were hurts and scars from these experiences, not to mention the energy lost in allthe physical upheavals. But there were liberations, too—from an unhappy marriage to a farmore gratifying love relationship; from controversies and endless explanations with the pow-ers-that-were in the organizations to which he belonged; and, most significantly, from sub-ordinating his own thinking to the basic guidelines of others, in particular, Freud and Marx.It would not be accurate to say that Reich deliberately chose opposition, enmity, andcrises. But it is true that his views were clearly sharpened by controversy, that he enjoyeddefining himself against opposition, and, indeed, that, like Freud, he could find in enmity anindex of the subversive, revolutionary thrust of his work. Above all, the repeated crises ofhis life—and especially those around 1934—helped him to find the strength to stand alone.After many years in various “second homes,” he was learning to follow Schiller’s dictum:“The strong man is at his most powerful alone” (Der Starke ist am machtigsten allein). He waslearning, in Ms own words, “never to yield to the pressure of wrong public opinion.”8One of Reich’s principal reasons for moving to Oslo in the fall of 1934 was thatHarold Schjelderup, an analyst and professor of psychology at the University of Oslo, hadoffered him the use of laboratory facilities at the Psychological Research Institute connect-ed with the university. While in Sweden, Schjelderup had begun treatment with Reich; nowhe wanted to continue, partly in order to learn his technique. Schjelderup was not especial-ly interested in Reich’s experimental work; indeed, he later became quite critical of it. It wasthe kind of trade-off typical for Reich: people wanted therapy from him and to learn abouthis technique; in return he received diverse help from them.What Reich had in mind was to investigate whether there were differences in elec-trical activity ofthe skin in states ofpleasure and anxiety,and,in particular, whether therewere differences of the erogenous zones 9.Once in Oslo, Reich sought the help of an assis-tant to decide on the appropriate kind ofapparatus to test his hypotheses. The apparatus,an oscillograph and an amplifier, which they decided to build, cost around 3,000 Norwegiankroner or about 500 dollars at the time. Reich raised this money through his clinical andteaching activities.From 1927 to 1933, a large part of Reich’s earnings from private practicehad gone to support his sex-political activities; after 1934, the bulk of his earnings as a ther-apist—and he earned well, charging around $15 a session in 1934—would be devoted to hisexperimental work.Characteristically, Reich proceeded by combining elements from other people’sresearch but at the same time giving them a novel twist. When he reviewed the relatively newfield ofskin electrophysiology, for example, he found techniques had been developed thatmight test his hypotheses, but that no one had ever considered using these techniques tostudy pleasure. The two available quantitative techniques, both discovered about 1890, werethose still in use today:skin resistance and skin potential measurements10.Most work,inMyron SharafFury On Earth200éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Reich’s time as today, used patterns of skin resistance response as an indicator of emotion-al response. Reich was not interested in this line of research because it could not distinguishbetween pleasurable and unpleasurable reactions. He was drawn instead to skin potential,because here one was measuring a spontaneous, sustained charge within the body—a chargethat showed variations in two directions, negative and positive11. He particularly noted pre-vious research that showed an increase in charge (more positive) after delicate touching ofthe skin. Further, it had been shown that there was often a substantial potential (or charge)between an electrode placed on intact skin and an electrode placed over a scratched orinjured site, the latter site reflecting a charge beneath the skin surface toward the “interior”of the body in which Reich was interested.He seems to have absorbed the available literature rather easily, including the evi-dence that the sweat glands played a role in at least some of the skin’s electrical behavior,moisture being a conductor of electricity. Reich responded characteristically to this evidenceby writing that the emphasis on finding a local mechanism (e.g., sweat-gland activity) “errsby confusing the means of fulfilling a function with the function itself.” He argued that thisreasoning set the local mechanism “apart from the functional unity of the organism as awhole,” in other words, the pleasure-anxiety function.Reich set out to clarify the role of the electrical charging of the skin as “the expres-sion of a unitary function related to the bio-electric totality of the organism.” He saw theskin as a “special kind of membrane,” with the capacity to hold or give up electrical chargeas a function of the “vegetative antithesis” he had already described qualitatively and whichhe now sought to quantify. He reasoned that the antithesis of “moving toward the world”or “moving away from the world” must also involve two directions in the flow of bioelec-tric charge. Pleasurable sensation should accompany charging of the periphery (toward theworld), while sensations of fear, anxiety, and disgust should parallel a decrease in peripher-al charge (toward the interior).Sophisticated skin potential measurements had only been possible for a few years,since the development ofthe triode vacuum tube.Reich describes his measurement appara-tus in some detail.It was a substantial apparatus for the times, involving the use of a vacu-um amplifier tube connected to an oscillograph whose moving light beam was filmed con-tinuously.His basic approach was to place the “experimental” electrode on an intact skin site,and the “reference”electrode on a site that had been scratched so that the charge beneaththe skin surface would be measured. (The same principle is used in traditional researchtoday.) First, he established that in a state of rest, nonerogenous zones have a potential of10-40 millivolts more negative than the “interior” (injured) site—a finding that was in keep-ing with the earlier research of others. The potential was relatively steady, varying little overtime for any one individual. Next, he studied subjects’ erogenous zones —“penis, vaginalmucosa, tongue, inner surface of the lips, anal mucosa, nipple.” These zones were found tobe much more variable and were capable of a much greater charge, either positive or nega-tive.16 : The Bio-electrical Experiments: 1934-1935201éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The central experiments consisted of attempts to measure potential changes in theerogenous zones during pleasurable or unpleasurable stimulation: tickling (pleasurable) andsudden pressure or sound (unpleasurable). His data showed that (1) When the subject felt pleasurable streaming sensations, the skin poten-tial increased in a positive direction.(2) When the subject felt pain, pressure, or any unpleasant sensation oremotion (except for anger), the potential became more negative.(3) The subjective intensity of the sensation reported by the subject cor-related well with the quantitative positive or negative change.(4) The same subject responded differently on different occasions inaccordance with his or her general mood.(5) There was a “disappointment” reaction. After a response to fright, pos-itive changes are much more difficult to obtain. It is as if the organism had become“cautious.”(6) Reich also noted a “dulling” effect. If the same pleasurable stimuluswas given repeatedly, the initial positive tracings flattened out.These findings depended upon one critical condition: the appropriate subject hadto be emotionally healthy enough to feel pleasure, and particularly pleasurable streamings, inhis or her body, and to be able to report these sensations accurately. Here we encounter oneof the problems of evaluating Reich’s research: most subjects are unable to feel or reportthese sensations reliably, and no other researcher has ever taken such variables into account.Reich found that an erect penis with no pleasure sensations had no increase in positivepotential. These observations supported Reich’s orgasm theory: mechanical tension (such aserection) had to be followed by energetic charge (more positive potential) before adequatepleasurable discharge and relaxation could take place.In a “critical control,” Reich drove home his assertion that sensation and charge areidentical.He had his subjects sit in a separate room from the experimenters, connected tothe amplifier by long wires. They would tickle or stimulate themselves according to instruc-tions,and then,based on their qualitativesensations and emotions,they predicted the kind ofquantitativetracing. Their guesses matched the tracings. For example, a subject reported twostrong sensations of pleasure while tickling her nipple near the electrode, correspondingwith the two sharpest positive deflections of the tracing. Reich could now offer evidencethat subjects only showed significant positive potential changes at erogenous zones whenthey subjectively felt pleasure, and that they did not feel pleasure without an increasing pos-itive potential: the two processes appeared to be identical.Reich also described some measurements of breathing taken over the abdomen,showing more negative potentials with inspiration and more positive potentials with expira-tion.He was not surprised when subjects with more inhibited respiration and less capacityto exhale completely showed less positive potential change during expiration than healthierMyron SharafFury On Earth202éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"subjects. This supported his clinical belief (to be described in Chapter 18) that inhibited res-piration is a central mechanism of a disturbed bio-energetic economy, suppressing the devel-opment of bio-energetic impulses from the solar plexus “toward the world.”The measurement in which he was most interested—potential changes during sex-ual intercourse—proved technically impossible to set up without interfering with the expe-rience because of the problem of electrode placement and stability. Reich had to settle fortracings made during masturbation and measurements of two subjects kissing or caressing.In his conclusions, Reich emphasized the functional identity of somatic and psy-chic processes, as expressed in the correspondence of skin potential measurements and sub-jectively felt sensations and emotions; and the antithetical directions toward the periphery(increased skin charge) and away from the periphery (decreased skin charge), correspondingwith pleasure and unpleasure sensations and emotions. Anticipating later work, he assertedthat organic diseases might result from disturbances of the bio-electrical equilibrium of theorganism. And he moved closer to a unitary theory of biological energy:Since only pleasurable vegetative sensations give rise to an increased sur-face charge ... we must assume that pleasurable excitation is the specific process ofall living organisms.Other biological processes show this also for example, cell divi-sion, in which the cell shows an increase in [electrical] surface charge coincidingwith the biologically productive process of mitosis (cell division). Hence the sexu-al process would simply be the biologically productive energy process The orgasmformula of tension-charge-discharge-relaxation must represent the general formula forall biological functions12.What can we say in evaluation of these experiments? When one shows Reich’smethodology and measurements to modern electrophysiologists, they raise a number oftechnical questions. For one thing, Reich did not always use the kind of firm electrodeattachment,with an electrolyte paste interface between electrode and skin to maintain elec-trical stability,that is accepted procedure today. But this defect does not explain the strikingdifference between erogenous and nonerogenous zones, nor the consistent correlation ofpositive charge with pleasure and negative with unpleasure.Modem researchers also question Reich’s way of reporting his results in narrativestyle and giving selected illustrative examples rather than supplying the details of number ofsubjects and complete data. However, such an approach was common in the mid-1930s.The fact is that the unique features of Reich’s experimental approach have neverbeen replicated, either by Reich’s own students or by traditional reSearchers. None of hisfollowers has been able to achieve the necessary combination of technical expertise, accessto subjects, and sufficient time to make multiple observations with a variety of subjects.Reich himself spent a good part of several years mastering both the technical and clinicalproblems ofachieving consistent results. On the other hand, traditional electrodermalresearchers have never approached these phenomena from anything resembling Reich’s van-16 : The Bio-electrical Experiments: 1934-1935203éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"tage point. In a 1971 review of studies of sexual arousal, Marvin Zuckerman notes thatReich was the first to study skin potential changes during sexual excitement13. It was notuntil 1968 that others made electrical measurements of erogenous areas. The studies citedby Zuckerman measured primarily skin resistance, with no distinction between positive andnegative charge. More basically, no other researcher has ever approached electrodermalfunctions as Reich did—as aspects of a unitary pleasure functionin the body.I could find but one detailed criticism of Reich’s bio-electrical research by anotherscientist, and for this we must return to Reich’s stay in Norway. The critique was by WilhelmHoffmann, a man well trained in physiology at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. Hiscritique was reported in newspaper articles about the controversy over Reich’s bion research(to be described in the next chapter). Sometime in 1935, Hoffmann collaborated with Reich.He was especially interested in testing Reich’s hypothesis that withdrawn schizophrenicswould show a lower skin potential than normal persons. He found that the patients’ skinpotentials were not in fact lower. Nor did Hoffmann find any differences in skin potentialbetween erogenous and nonerogenous zones of the patients14.Reich in turn criticized Hoffmann’s procedures, Hoffmann, he said, had used elec-trodes attached to glass cups that were then fastened over the subjects’ nipples with adhe-sive tape. “From a mechanical viewpoint,” Reich commented, “everything was perfect.Hoffmann only overlooked one point and that was the crucial one. A pleasure reaction does-n’t occur if one attaches glass with adhesive tape to a living organ.”15The controversy between Reich and Hoffmann neatly illustrates a problem inher-ent in Reich’s research and others’ response to it. Theoretically there was merit on both sides,paralleling the differences between Reich’s and current traditional skin research. Hoffmannargued that Reich’s technique did not exclude spurious results, and he altered the techniquein a way that matches modern practice. Reich argued that Hoffmann had taken insufficientcare not to interfere with the subjects’ experience of pleasure, a criticism that would applyequally well to virtually all modern research. And the difficulty was exacerbated by the eventsthat followed, which is also typical of Reich’s career. After their initial friendly collaboration,Hoffmann became extremely embittered toward Reich and denounced him as totallyunequipped for laboratory work in electrophysiology. He went so far as to suggest that Reichbe expelled from Norway as an undesirable immigrant. Reich, in turn, dismissed all ofHoffmann’s criticisms as stemming from his irrationally hostile or “mechanistic” attitude.Given the furor that surrounded Masters and Johnson’s work some twenty-fiveyears later, one would have expected considerable criticism of Reich for undertaking labo-ratory studies of sexuality at all, whether well or badly. There was some criticism along theselines, but its severity was diminished for several reasons. First, by the time Reich publishedhis findings in 1937,they were soon overshadowed by the storm of controversy surround-ing his work on the bions,to be discussed next. Second, during the first years of hisNorwegian residence, Reich successfully kept a low profile. He had many colleagues and stu-dents,but he made no effort, as he had done earlier, to disseminate his work widely amongthe public.His articles appeared in German in his own journal, which had a small circula-Myron SharafFury On Earth204éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"tion, and he gave few public talks.But when the storm did erupt late in 1937, the bio-electric experiments were oneof the targets. Various rumors circulated in the press, the most pernicious of which was thatReich wanted to use mental patients as subjects in studies of sexual intercourse, A particu-lar kind of condensation was at work here. Reich didwant to study mental patients and, asnoted, Hoffmann carried out some studies with such patients. Reich also wanted to investi-gate bioelectrical changes during sexual intercourse with normal subjects, but the technicaldifficulties we have noted precluded this experiment. (There may well have been socialobstacles, too. Studies of masturbation and of a nude couple kissing were bold enough stepsfor the 1930s!) Hoffmann’s experiments and Reich’s plan were telescoped into the oftrepeatedstory that Reich did study, or planned to study, sexual intercourse between mental patients.The conception of Reich’s experiments involving “crazy” sex orgies would pursue him tothe end of his days, as would the dual criticism that he entered fields where he lacked knowl-edge and that he failed to design his experiments properly or in replicable form.205éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"17 : The Bions: 1936-1939The first few years in Norway provided a peaceful period for Reich. Once again hehad a lively, talented group of people around him—psychotherapists, social scientists, andwriters. He was evolving new techniques in therapy based on muscular armor. He was busywith the bio-electrical experiments in the laboratory. He was working on his manuscriptPeople in Trouble, in which he was beginning to chart his work-democratic concepts. And hisrelationship with Elsa was a relatively happy one.At this juncture Reich chose to begin research on the bions—vesicles which, Reichasserted, represented transitional stages between nonliving and living substance. Thisresearch was to seal the diagnosis of his psychosis for many contemporaries. Until now,Reich had worked in psychoanalysis, sociology, and electrophysiology, all fields devoted tothe study of human beings. Still more specifically, his work had centered on human sexual-ity and its various manifestations, clinically, socially, electrodermally. Even the bio-electricexperiments might have been charitably interpreted by his critics as a misguided effort onthe part of a zealous amateur who took Freud’s “metaphor” of the libido too seriously andtried to measure it.The bion research, however, was to take Reich outside the human realm —to thestudy, he was to assert, of the development of pulsating minute particles from nonlivingmatter, and of the development of protozoa (unicellular microorganisms, the most primi-tive forms of animal life) from nonliving matter—to the problem, in short, of biogenesis.Reich frankly acknowledged that he was not well trained in this particular domain1.I would like to anticipate, briefly, a question that is bound to surface: Why did Reichchoose to tackle a problem for which, according to his own admission, he was not “suffi-ciently”prepared? And why at a time when he was still engrossed with another problem—the bio-electric experiments—for which he was also insufficiently prepared? Two alternativeanswers are possible.The first, offered by many of his critics, was that Reich was in the grip of a mega-lomanic passion that required ever greater achievements. Since there was no substance to hisfooling around in the laboratory, he had to move on from one “discovery” to the next. Noslow, careful, fruitful development could issue from any of his fantasies.The second, offered by Reich and his students, was that he was following the logicof his research. Like Thoreau, but for different ends, Reich wanted “to drive life into a cor-ner and reduce it to its lowest terms.” In his therapeutic work, Reich had shifted from ananalytic focus on complex psychological processes to his own stress on relatively simpleMyron SharafFury On Earth206éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"streamings of energy-emotion and their blockage by the character-muscular armor.However, only at times could he directly glimpse these streamings and their culmination inthe “orgasm reflex,” the goal of his treatment. Microscopic observation of the primitiveprotozoa was one key path Reich traveled to the discovery of the bions. By studying proto-zoa he could move much closer to his own domain—the question from medical school days:What is life?—with far fewer extraneous processes than was the case with patients. He coulddirectly observe the streamings of vesicles and reproduction through cell division.If Reich’s path was logical, one can still question its wisdom. There is somethingbrave and foolhardy, effective and self-defeating, about Reich’s working in such diversefields. Brave and effective because if he was on to something in each research realm, he wasundoubtedly right that the initial breakthrough was harder than the subsequent details.Foolhardy and selfdefeating because others were more likely to join any such effort only ifa solid, well-controlled set of studies was available for scrutiny.Reich would argue the last point by stating that even where he had provided con-siderable detail (in his clinical studies of orgastic impotence and orgastic potency, for exam-ple), few saw fit to collaborate with him on studying the particular issue of involuntary bodyconvulsions during sexual intercourse. Only those aspects of his work that could be sub-sumed within existing conceptual schemes,his character-analytic and his mass-psychologicalstudies, received wide acclaim.In order to observe protozoa, Reich went to the Botanical Institute in Oslo toobtain cultures of amoebae, the most common form of protozoa. An assistant at theInstitute told him that all he had to do was put blades of grass in water and examine themafter ten to fourteen days. Reich reported that he asked the assistant—“at the time naivelyand without any special reason in mind”—how the protozoa came into the infusion. “Fromthe air, naturally,” the assistant replied, with an astonished look at Reich. “And how do theycome into the air?” Reich asked further. “That we do not know,” the assistant answered2.Reich may have asked his questions “naively” at the particular moment, but the question ofthe origin ofliving organisms from nonliving matter was very much on his mind. As we shallsee,right around this time he was starting another series of experiments on biogenesis.Reich was always put off by vague explanations that were difficult to test. Finally, the reac-tion of“astonished”looks to his questions led him to believe that his questions were impor-tant.Reich had recently obtained an excellent Leitz microscope, which he proceeded touse to examine the grass infusion. As he had been told, protozoa did appear after some days.He was able to observe various types of amoebae and paramecia (another form of proto-zoa).He observed both the place-toplace serpentine movements of the protozoa and theinternal plasmatic streaming that had been noted by Ludwig Rhumbler and Max Hartmann.However, Reich was also interested in the developmental processes he noticed atthe edge of the grass blade. He was struck by the following phenomenon: If the plant tis-sue was kept under continuous observation from when it was first put in to soak, the cellsat the edge gradually disintegrated into vesicles, which eventually broke off from the main17 : The Bions: 1936-1939207éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"structure and floated freely in the water. (Vesicles are here defined as “small bladders, cavi-ties, sacs, cysts, bubbles or hollow structures.”) Often the vesicles would collect together andfloat around in clumps, initially without any clearly defined borders or membranes.Reich also described the process in which a clear border or margin developed:I observed the change taking place in both the vesicular structure and theformation of a border in one object over a period of four hours. An irregularlystructured, boundaryless, vesicular object had formed at the margin of a piece ofplant. The object gradually swelled and detached itself from the section of plant.Double refracting margins appeared on the edges. The vesicular structure becamemoreregular and homogeneous and the vesicles refracted light with greater con-trast. In its structure the object was almost indistinguishable from a passing amoe-ba. It assumed a long oval shape and became increasingly taut as the margin becamemore complete and distinct3.In another instance, Reich saw a formation that showed both the vesicular struc-ture and the well-defined margin. It adhered to a stalk on the grass infusion. Occasionally,the cluster of vesicles would try to jerk away, only to be pulled back by the stalk.Since Reich wanted to observe developments within the grass continuously, he uti-lized time-lapse photography, a procedure now quite common, but rarely used in the 1930s.He had to solve a series of technical problems, one of them being the requirement of acompletely still preparation for the purposes of photography versus the need for oxygen toprevent the dying off of any germinating forms.One cannot overstress the significance of his continuous observation. Around themiddle of the nineteenth century, Louis Pasteur had demonstrated that the kinds of livingforms the upholders of spontaneous generation affirmed did not occur when the nonlivingmatter,the water in which it was immersed, and the surrounding air were all sterilized. SincePasteur,biologists have been in total agreement that protozoa develop from spores in theair that settle in the grass. Over time, in interaction with the grass infusion, these spores orgerm cysts become protozoa. Whether this explanation is valid or whether Reich’s concep-tual scheme is correct (namely, that the protozoa develop not from spores but from the dis-integrating grass infusion alone), the initial point is that no one since Pasteur had carefullydescribed developments within the grass infusion from which protozoa eventually emerged.To quote Reich: “They say nothing about what takes placein the grass or moss. They simplystate that after a few days the protozoa are ‘there.’ ”4The study of grass infusions revealed various kinds of motility, which he firstobserved,then photographed. In particular, Reich distinguished four separate types:5ROLLING—Individual vesicles within the clump of particles rolled rhythmi-cally toward and away from each other, as though showing attraction and repulsion.Myron SharafFury On Earth208éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"ROTATION—Circular movements of vesicles within the heap wereobserved, and if these movements were strong enough, the whole heap includingthe membrane would rotate. This movement might continue for hours.CONFLUENCE OF THE ENERGY VESICLES—In many kinds of developingprotozoa, the boundaries between the individual vesicles disappeared and the plas-ma formed a homogeneous mass. In others, the vesicular structure remained untilfully developed.PULSATION—At a magnification of about 3000x, one could see very finemovements of expansion and contraction within individual vesicles in the heap andin the heap as a whole.He also observed that at the edges of the disintegrating grass, one could find, inaddition to “finished” protozoa, every stage in their development and form.When individual vesicles or particles showed the kinds of spontaneous, innermovement described above, Reich called them “bions,” transitional forms between the non-living and the living. In his view, protozoa developed from the heaps or clusters of bions,which in turn emerged from the disintegrating grass.Apart from the question ofwhere the “life” of the protozoa originated, Reich’s fas-cination with, his persistent attention to, transitional states between the nonmotile and themotile is evident here once more. The same trait was manifested in his careful attention tothe loosening of “nonmobile” rigid character traits, followed by the emergence of the “life”of strong affects; to the loosening of chronic, inflexible muscular spasms, again followed bythe emergence of “spontaneous” sensations and emotions; and to the breakdown of fixedsocial patterns, with the emergence of freer and sometimes also more chaotic ways of life.There is one technical objection to Reich’s microscopic work that should be dealtwith immediately. This concerns the very high magnification up to 4000x he used. The stan-dard criticism was that clear definition of structure is not possible above a certain power ofmagnification, around 2Ooox. However, in many instances Reich was not primarily con-cerned with the fine details ofstructure but rather with motility within the vesicles andheaps ofvesicles. Although he made this point over and over again, critics still claimed thathe did not understand microscopy,since he did not know there was a limit on magnificationusing light6. The electron microscope, devised after the period under discussion, would nothave solved Reich’s problem. While it permits much higher magnification, it can only beused with stained tissue.The study ofprotozoal development in grass infusions was not Reich’s only pathto the investigation of transitional forms between the nonliving and the living. About thesame time as he began his protozoal studies, Reich was curious about the transformation offood into energy. For his first “experiment,” he “threw meat, potatoes, vegetables of allkinds,milk and eggs into a pot which he filled with water; he cooked the mixture for halfan hour, took a sample and hurried with it to the microscope.”717 : The Bions: 1936-1939209éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Reich had the wit and distance from himself to note that anyone who observed himplaying with food would only have dismissed him as “crazy.” But at the same time he makesan argument for exactly that kind of childlike “playing” at the beginning of a researchendeavor, comparing it with the great “discoveries” of a young child8.When Reich put his mixture under the microscope, he thought he would be able todistinguish the different foods that comprised the brew. However, the preparation containednothing but vesicles, of different sizes but the same basic type. More significantly, when heobserved the vesicles using higher magnifications (over 2000x), he noted a motility withinthem, an innerexpansion and contraction. He believed that these vesicles from foodstuffswere functionally identical with the vesicles observed in the grass infusions. And he calledthem both bions.Reich now made infusions of many different types of substances, organic and inor-ganic. Sometimes he would simply allow the substances to disintegrate in water, sometimeshe would heat them. Sometimes the bionous development was slower or faster; but disinte-gration was never absent, no matter what the original material.The vesicular heaps of bions showed other lifelike characteristics besides pulsation.They moved about. They ingested unattached vesicles—that is, they appeared to eat. Attimes they divided into smaller heaps, which expanded as they took up fluid or unattachedvesicles, thus simulating reproduction and growth.Reich’s critics would later claim that Reich believed he had “created life.” This ver-sion suggests that Reich alleged he had developed some kind of artificial life, like Dr.Frankenstein. Reich’s position was not that he had created artificial life, but rather that hehad succeeded in revealing experimentally the developmental living process that was contin-ually occurring in nature. In geology, this kind of perspective has recently become dominantunder the name “uniformitarianism,” the theory that “the present is the key to the past, thatifyou want to understand how a rock is formed you go watch it forming now.”9For Reich,life was like a rock in this respect: you could go watch it forming now. This orientation con-trasts sharply with the orthodox biological notion that life was created once in the far dis-tant past and since then “all life has come from life.”Three explanations have been offered for the presence of motile forms in Reich’spreparations—the first two by his critics, the third by Reich himself.The first is that Reich’s preparations were not completely sterile and there had beenaccidental infection by “spores” or “germs” from the air. What Reich was observing and cultur-ing were known forms of bacteria or protozoal organisms, which came “from outside.”Alternatively, his materials contained spores in a dormant state, which were liberated in solution.To meet this objection, Reich sterilized the substance to be placed in the infusionas well as the solution itself. The result of the sterilization procedure was surprising: not onlydid the vesicular behavior still occur, but it appeared more rapidly, and gave rise to more vig-orous movements.Moreover, Reich heated coal particles to incandescence (1500°C) before immersingMyron SharafFury On Earth210éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"them in solution. It should be noted that classical biology claimed no germs could surviveabove a temperature of 180°C. Still, Reich was able to observe mobile forms from the coalparticles immediately after their sterilization.Reich’s final answer to the argument of air-germ infection was a series of controlexperiments devised by an associate, Roger du Teil, who set up a hermetically sealed system.This, too, had no effect on the development of the bions10.The second interpretation was that the movements Reich observed were not bio-logical at all but physico-chemical. Physics was familiar with the fact that small particlesoscillate slightly, due to the phenomenon known as Brownian movement, believed to becaused by the bombardment of the particles with molecules.Reich gave several answers to this interpretation. Brown was concerned with theplace-to-place movement of particles. Brownian movement could not explain the innermotility, the pulsation of the bions, which Reich emphasized. Moreover, particles of coke orearth had other life properties besides movement, such as ingestion of particles and divi-sion, which Brownian movement was obviously unable to account for.Reich’s own interpretation was that the preparations contained forms with somelife properties. Some kind of transitional organization between the nonliving and the livinghad been discovered. Reich had succeeded in the laboratory in reproducing some of theconditions for the “natural organization” of living forms from nonliving matter.Reich’s bion research yielded in turn the first inkling of a new form of energy—anenergy he was later to name “orgone energy.” Briefly, the initial path was as follows:In some of his preparations, Reich noted two kinds of bions: the more common,packet-shaped, blue amoeboid vesicles, and much smaller, lancetshaped red forms. Reichtermed the first type “PA-bions,” and the smaller type “T-bacilli,” for reasons that will bedescribed in connection with his work on cancer (in Chapter 22).He soon discovered that the two types had an antithetical effect on each other. ThePA-bions immobilized the T-bacilli.In his own words: “T-bacilli which are in the neighbor-hood ofthe blue bions show a restless activity, they turn round and round, then remain, withtrembling movements, in one and the same spot and finally become immobile. As time goeson,more and more T-bacilli conglomerate around the blue bions; they agglutinate. The‘dead’ T-bacilli seem to attract and kill the still living ones.”11Reich here made several observations, the full significance of which would onlybecome apparent later:The blue color of the PA-bions would be found to be characteristic of manyorgone energy phenomena.In his observation of the PA-bions, Reich was noting an action at a distance. Someforce within the PA-bions was not simply providing the source of inner motility butwas affecting another organism. He noticed the same effect even more dramatical-ly in a laboratory accident.17 : The Bions: 1936-1939211éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"In January 1939, one of his assistants took the wrong container from the sterilizerand, instead of earth, heated ocean sand. After two days there was a growth in the solutionwhich, inoculated on egg medium and agar, resulted in a yellow growth. This new kind ofculture consisted microscopically of large, slightly mobile, blue vesicles. Examination at2000-4000x showed forms that refracted light strongly and consisted of heaps of six to tenvesicles. It appeared that the effect of these bions—which Reich called “SAPA-bions”—onbacteria in general and T-bacilli in particular was much stronger than that of other bions.In the course of studying these bions, Reich’s eyes began to hurt when he lookedinto the microscope for a long time. As a control experiment, he used a monocular tube; henoticed that, regularly, only the eye with which he looked at these cultures began to hurt.Finally, he developed a violent conjunctivitis and the ophthalmologist prohibited microscop-ic work for a few weeks. His eyes improved, but now Reich more definitely suspected theexistence of a radiation.Reich proceeded to test the sand culture for radiation by holding the test tubes ofSAPA-bions against his palm. Each time he thought he felt a fine prickling, but he was notsure of the sensation. To test the objectivity of the phenomenon, he placed a quartz slideon his skin,put some SAPA-cultures on the slide,and left the preparation there for aboutten minutes. On the spot where the culture had been (separated from the skin by the slide),an anemic spot with a red margin developed.Reich was also surprised by certain visual phenomena observable in a dark base-ment room where the SAPA-bions were kept. When he tried to study these phenomenamore carefully, he noted:The ... observations in the dark were somehow ‘weird.’ After the eyes hadbecome adapted to the darkness, the room did not appear black, but grey-blue. Therewere fog-like formations and bluish dots and lines of light. Violet light phenome-na seemed to emanate from the walls as well as from various objects in the room.When I held a magnifying glass before my eyes, these light impressions, all of themblue or grey-blue,became more intense, the individual lines and dots became larger....WhenI closed my eyes, the blue light impressions continued, nonetheless12.By 1939,the bion research was becoming expensive. With funds from his ownearnings together with gifts from students, colleagues, and friends, Reich managed to raiseabout $9,000 to pay for a good microscope, microfilm equipment, and other laboratoryinstruments he needed.In addition, Reich and his associates raised about $300 weekly to payfor his laboratory assistants.David Boadella has written that “it says much for the loyalty of the group that hadformed around him, and of his friends and even patients that those who could help withdonations responded magnificently”.13Unfortunately, matters were more complicated thanthat. Most of the people who helped Reich were in therapy with him and, often, in a kindMyron SharafFury On Earth212éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"of “training analysis” in order to learn his technique. With justification, Otto Fenichel hascriticized Reich for abusing the transference situation—the patient’s dependence upon anddevotion to his therapist—by getting such people to help him through working or givingmoney or both. The fact that many were also students, eager for his stamp of approval, forreferrals from him, heightened this situation. Often when for one reason or another theybecame disappointed in Reich, and when he was under attack from more scientificallytrained professionals, they could regret their earlier enthusiasm. Sometimes they would askfor their money back, which led to ugly scenes. Reich’s reminder that he had expresslywarned them before they gave money or other help seems somewhat self-serving in the faceof the blinding power of transference. The rage Reich felt toward those who went back ontheir original loyalty was the kind of rage one may feel when one also has guilt feelings.Reich faced a predicament. He had appealed to the Rockefeller Foundation in Paristo support the bion project, but his request was turned down. Ever since his medical schooldays, Reich had been convinced that his life and work were a heroic mission and that theytherefore “deserved” support. Given the world’s opposition, he could not afford to be fas-tidious about where that help came from. Once when he was analyzing certain dishonestmechanisms in a patient who was also working for him, he said: “I can see the scoundrel inyou because there is a scoundrel in me.I recognized that many of your motives for work-ing had nothing to do with the work itself but stemmed from a desire to please me. And stillI used you because I needed your help.”14A further complication of this period and one that was to continue through the restof Reich’s life was that most of his colleagues were trained in medicine, clinical psychology,literature, sociology, or philosophy. To my knowledge, not one was a trained natural scien-tist. Nor were they able or willing to make the long investment to become one. Among hisclose associates in Oslo were Odd Havrevold, a psychiatrist; Ola Raknes, who had receivedhis Ph.D. in linguistics and then trained as a psychoanalyst in the early 1930s; HaroldSchjelderup, who was academically the most prominent of Reich’s associates but still not atrained scientist;and Nic Hoel,the psychiatrist whose husband Sigurd, the well-known nov-elist,served as editor of Reich’s Journal.These people took a variety of stances toward Reich’s experimental work.Schjelderup,who was skeptical even of his sociological endeavors, was distinctly cool, claim-ing that he lacked the competence to judge the experiments but was nonetheless dubious.Indeed,when the public attacks started against the bion research, Schjelderup severedReich’s connection with the Psychological Institute because it had become an embarrass-ment to him15.At the time,Nic Hoel criticized the attitude of those who waited for theverdict of others as intellectual laziness and cowardice. Later she, too, withdrew her supportfrom Reich’s experimental work, arguing that before she could intelligently respond to it, shewould have to undergo a completely new training in physics and biology; after seven yearsof training in medicine, seven in psychiatry, and four in child psychiatry, she was not pre-pared for a whole new education16.Only Raknes felt prepared to defend Reich’s work quitefully,in Norway as later in America, on the basis of his own laboratory observations and the17 : The Bions: 1936-1939213éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"theoretical persuasiveness of Reich’s approach.One supporter of Reich during this period not at all involved in therapy was Rogerdu Teil, whom Reich had met on a visit to France in February 1936. At the time, du Teil wasa professor of philosophy at the Centre Universitaire Méditerranée in Nice. A man of broadinterests and great personal charm, he had published a book of poetry as well as psycholog-ical and philosophical works. Du Teil had a theoretical interest in problems of biogenesisbut apparently had done no experimental work prior to his association with Reich. Reichattended one of du Teil’s lectures and saw in him a potential supporter, one well situated inFrench intellectual circles.For his part, du Teil was interested in Reich, “whom I knew by name for he hadwritten a book,Character Analysis, which immediately interested me since my research in psy-choanalysis was along the same lines.” Du Teil describes how, “After a long conversationwhich continued late into the night, Reich asked me if I would be willing to control hisexperiments ... on biogenesis. ... He was near forty then, and I fifty-one, which explains hisrequest. ... To him I was an influential person. He counted on me to make his discoveries‘official’ so to speak, and get them accepted in high scientific circles.”17When Reich returned to Oslo, he sent some bion specimens to du Teil. During thesummer of1937,du Teil came to work with Reich in the laboratory in Oslo, “Upon myreturn to France I carried out some other experiments on the same subject [bions] not with-out first having conceived and devised an adequate apparatus for the purpose of avoidingall possible contamination from air germs.”One of the criticisms later directed against Reich’s work was that du Teil was nomore a scientist than he was. In response, du Teil declared that it was “unnecessary to be adirector of research or a Nobel Prize winner to know how to work correctly and under ster-ile conditions in a laboratory/* In any case Reich valued du Teil’s work, and, in an unusualgesture, included his report on several bion experiments in his new book Die Bione(The Bion),which was published by his Sexpol Verlag in 1938.Du Teil’s role became somewhat problematic, however, when he began to speak ofthe discovery of the bions as a joint achievement. Reich had no intention of sharing the dis-covery with anyone. Whatever his annoyance with du Teil, it never affected the respect hefelt for the man.And du Teil never questioned the originality and value of Reich’s work onthe bions, although he did not entirely agree that bions represented living forms. In 1973,when du Teil was eighty-seven, he still wrote of Reich with affection and respect, if also withthe somewhat patronizing tone of an older man assessing an extremely gifted but impulsiveyounger colleague18.In 1936, du Teil was also responsible for initiating contact between Reich and theAcademic des Sciences in Paris. Reich sent the Academy a preparation of charcoal bions. InJanuary 1938, Louis Lapicque of the Academy sent a reply:Dear Dr.Reich:Charged by the Academy to study your communication of January 8, 1937,Myron SharafFury On Earth214éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"1 waited for the film which you wrote you were going to send. When it did notcome I examined microscopically the preparations you sent with your first report.I have, indeed, found the lifelike movements which you describe. There is some-thing surprising here, in view of the long time that has elapsed since the prepara-tions were made.I would like to suggest to the Academy a brief publication of your find-ings, followed by a short note by myself confirming the facts and containing aphysico-chemical interpretation for which I alone would be responsible. Leavingaside your electrical theory which has nothing to do with the experiment, would itbe agreeable for you to have your communication published simply in the form ofthe enclosed extract, which, in fact, is a summary of the important part? It seemsto me that in this way your wish to see your findings published in our Bulletinwouldbe satisfied19.Reich characteristically refused consent to publication under the conditions pro-posed by Lapicque. If he was willing to accept help for dubious motivations, he was unwill-ing to take support wherever strings were attached. Although he badly needed even the par-tial confirmation ofan august body like the French Academy, he would not make a bargainthat vitiated what he believed to be the most significant part of his findings.Whatever professional support Reich received was as nothing compared to the ava-lanche of attacks his experiments evoked publicly. The criticisms were precipitated by a pre-liminary report on the bion experiments in Reich’s Journalin the summer of 1937. OnSeptember 22, the Norwegian newspaper Aftenpostenpublished a brief summary of the arti-cle, followed by comments from a Norwegian biologist, Klaus Hansen. Hansen took a cau-tious, let’s-wait-for-the-full-report position, but offered the opinion that it was extremelyunlikely that Reich had succeeded in developing living substance. He further opined thatReich had confused life signs with Brownian movement.Hansen’s comment about Brownian movement was typical of the frustrating qual-ity ofthe dialogue between Reich and his critics. Reich would present a finding with a giveninterpretation (particles or bions with an inner pulsation), and the critics would then makeanother interpretation (Brownian, place-to-place movement) rendering the initial findingtotally insignificant. Reich would reply along lines already discussed, but the critics wouldignore the answer or repeat the original criticism, attributing stupidity or grandiosity to Reichfor failing to have understood them the first time.The newspaper criticism might have stopped with Hansen’s relatively cautiousremarks. However, right around that time Reich sought the assistance of Leiv Kreyberg,Norway’s foremost cancer specialist, since Reich had come to believe that his bion researchmight be relevant to the cancer problem. Kreyberg and Reich had met in 1936. They sharedan interest in photomicrographs; Kreyberg, who never had anything else good to say aboutReich, commented that Reich’s film equipment and technique were excellent20.Reich spent two hours in the fall of 1937 showing Kreyberg various bion demon-17 : The Bions: 1936-1939215éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"strations. Kreyberg took a sample home, studied the specimen, and identified the forms assimple bacteria resulting from air infection. Nonetheless, Reich and Havrevold continued toseek further research materials from Kreyberg. According to Kreyberg, he met the two menin the hospital where he worked in order to test Reich’s expertise to see if some kind of col-laboration was possible. Again according to Kreyberg, Reich failed the test, being ignorantof basic bacteriological and anatomical facts21.Reich’s version of the same meeting is that he refused to permit Kreyberg to testhim. Indeed, Reich claimed that when Kreyberg had visited his laboratory, the famous can-cer specialist had not recognized live cancer cells under high magnification22. Thus anopportunity for a scientific exchange degenerated into mere name-calling.A similar kind of encounter occurred between Reich and Professor Thjotta, a well-known Norwegian biologist. Reich had sent a preparation to the Oslo BacteriologicalInstitute where Thjotta worked, with a request for an identification of certain forms. Thjottaused the occasion to issue a statement that he had controlled Reich’s experiments and thatReich had again discovered nothing more than bacteria resulting from air infection23.The fact that Reich had turned to Kreyberg and Thjotta undoubtedly gave them—along with their acknowledged scientific prestige—a kind of authority over his work in theeyes of the press and the public. Their opinions were published in the Aftenpostenon April19 and 21, 1938, some six months after the first criticism by Hansen. Kreyberg’s tone wasespecially cutting, referring throughout to “Mr. Reich” and claiming that “Mr. Reich” knewless anatomy and bacteriology than a first-year medical student. When Reich and his sup-porters requested that detailed control studies be done, Kreyberg replied that Reich’sresearch did not merit such expense. He had already seen enough to render a negative opin-ion ofthe studies themselves and ofReich’s competence as a scientist.In response to the reports ofKreyberg and Thjotta, Reich issued a statement onApril 27, contending that his opponents had not conducted “an extensive and accurate con-trol ofmy experiments. It would be advantageous if there could be an end to the futile dis-cussions, interpretations and comparisons which have appeared in the press lately.”24Reich suggested that independent experts should carry out control studies—stud-ies that would require two to three hours of daily work for two to three weeks. Reich set twofurther conditions: his set of instruments must be used, and “I myself must be in charge ofthe experiments.”Here Reich went to extremes as much as his critics. They had quickly explainedaway his findings and refused to replicate his experimental procedures. He in turn was ask-ing for a degree of control over replications of his work that was quite beyond any accept-ed scientific procedure. Replications of original experiments have to follow the original pro-tocol,no matter how laborious or complex that protocol may be. But the very idea of inde-pendent verification ofa finding precludes the original experimenter’s being “in charge of”the control studies. Reich’s proposal was never taken up. Essentially, his critics did not deemhis studies worth the effort of repeating.Had Reich’s experiments been the only target of his opponents’ wrath, the news-Myron SharafFury On Earth216éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"paper uproar might have waned after the critiques of Kreyberg and Thjotta. However, hisexperimental work was but the most ludicrous part of his endeavors; many other delectableitems remained for public perusal. Indeed, even before the interviews with Kreyberg andThjotta, Ingjald Nissen, an Adlerian psychologist who some years earlier had praised Reich’scharacter-analytic work, now declared in the Norwegian daily,Arbeiderbladet, for December28, 1937: “Psychoanalysis in this country has become sort of a weedy garden, where allkinds of parasites and climbers strike root and almost choke what is of value.” He com-plained about the quackery of “psychoanalytic sectarians” who “do not even call themselvespsychoanalysts any longer,” and who practice “some sort of quasi-medicinal relaxationanalysis” which “only leads to sexual relations.” Nissen felt that something should be doneabout the situation. He suggested that Norwegian physicians and recognized psychologistsshould band together to decide who should be allowed to practice psychoanalysis.An ominous note had entered the controversy. One was no longer dealing withalternative explanations for the movement of minute particles, something beyond the kenof the average reader, but with psychiatric “quackery” that led to “sexual relations.” Thedebate was beginning to involve Reich’s professional practice. Nissen was correct that Reichno longer called himself a psychoanalyst. Later, I shall detail Reich’s therapeutic develop-ments during these years;suffice it here to say his technique involved more direct work onthe muscular armor. He was now seeing patients clad in shorts (men) or bra and shorts(women) so that he could observe fluctuations in body movement, expressions, and temper-ature more closely. Semi-nude patients, bio-electric experiments with a naked couple kissing,pulsating vesicles—it was a volatile mixture indeed for the popular press and for the quietcity of Oslo.The person who channeled the diverse criticism into a barrage of newspaper arti-cles during the spring and summer of 1938 was Johann Scharffenberg, M.D. Scharffenberg,then in his seventies, was the grand old man of Norwegian psychiatry. He had little sympa-thy for psychoanalysis of any kind and held moralistic views on sexual matters, althoughpolitically he was no reactionary.Whatever his reasons, Scharffenberg was relentless toward Reich. He used everyargument,fair or foul, he could find. These included that Reich’s experiments were non-sense;that Reich might never have received an M.D. degree; that Reich wished to arrangesexual intercourse between mental patients for experimental purposes; that his psychiatrictreatment aroused lascivious excitement; that his “sex propaganda among the young shouldbe investigated,” for if the young followed his teaching, “they would very soon end up inconflict with the Norwegian Criminal Code”; and that Reich was violating the conditions ofhis Norwegian visa by treating patients rather than simply limiting himself to teaching andresearch25.Only the last point needs any elaboration at this stage. Scharffenberg based hisaccusation on a case history Reich published about an “alcoholic engineer.” Reich’s adher-ents replied that Scharffenberg must be unaware of the policy of disguising case histories,and that in fact all of Reich’s “patients” were professional persons who were also undergo-17 : The Bions: 1936-1939217éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"ing training with him. This last argument was somewhat stretched to include the writerSigurd Hoel, whose therapy undoubtedly contributed to his editing Reich’s Journalbut whowas not in fact being trained as a therapist.Another related point was made by Wilhelm Hoffmann, the replicator in 1935 ofthe bio-electrical experiments but now one of Reich’s bitterest opponents. Hoffmann wrote,correctly, that “Mr. Reich” had not taken any examinations in Norway to practice medicine,a requirement made of emigres. Reich had by-passed this regulation on the grounds that hewas not practicing medicine but engaging solely in teaching and research26.By February 1938, Reich’s visa had expired and the authorities were confrontedwith his request for an extension. The opposition, led by Scharffenberg and Kreyberg,argued vehemently against any extension. As Kreyberg put it:If it is a question of handing Dr. Reich over to the Gestapo, then I willfight that, but if one could get rid of him in a decent manner, that would be thebest. More than one million miserable refugees are knocking at our door and thereis reason for us to show mercy. It seems sad to me, however, that a man of Dr.Reich’s nature is admitted. ... Dr. Reich’s visa is a blow to those of us who wouldlike to see a more open door policy to refugees. It is people like him who have part-ly created the refugee problem ... by their irresponsibility27.Reich’s supporters received equal space in the Norwegian press. Their defense andtheir appeal for an extension of his visa varied depending upon the individual, ranging fromNic Hoel’s and Ola Raknes’s spirited rejoinders to all the criticisms to Schjelderup’s morequalified position. Most dubious now about Reich’s experimental work, Schjelderupnonetheless believed the visa should be extended because of Reich’s past and present con-tributions to psychotherapy:There can hardly be any doubt that Reich has provided such rewardingmethodological contributions, and, with them, such significant new clinical experi-ences that his work must be regarded as pioneering. ... I recommend a visa andwork permit for Reich in Norway because of his merits in the field of characteranalysis It is all wrong that the “bion” affair ... has become a central matter in thevisa question.... Dr. Reich’s strength lies in his intuition which has made it possiblefor him to make a number of important empirical discoveries and to provide direc-tionsofthe greatest significance to other researchers28.Sigurd Hoel provided a satirical defense. He viewed the criticism of Reich’s exper-imental work as a side issue,but also saw the public’s position: “We, the big public ... thinkit real fun when scientists attack one another and divest each other of honor and dignity.Moreover, this Reich seems to be a highly dubious person, and it is a good thing that wehave people like ScharfFenberg ... who can put down this slim customer.”Myron SharafFury On Earth218éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Then Hoel went on to add that there were a “few very odd things about the con-troversy. All of a sudden it is claimed that Dr. Reich must be expelled from the country.When did it become a crime to perform some biological experiments, even if they shouldprove to be amateurish? When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in amicroscope when one was not a trained biologist?” Hoel argued that the real reason for theintense outcry was not Reich’s experiments but his revolutionary work on human sexuality.After all, psychoanalysis had met the same kind of opposition Reich was now encounter-ing29.In addition to his Norwegian colleagues, Reich received professional support fromtwo persons outside the country who had independent reputations. The first was BronislawMalinowski, whose work Reich had drawn on so heavily a few years earlier. Malinowskiwrote to the Norwegian press on March 12, 1938:Both through the works he [Reich] has published and through personalmeetings he has impressed rne as an original and sound thinker, a true personality,and a man with an open character and courageous views. I consider his sociologi-cal works to be a distinct and valuable contribution toward science. In my opinionit would be a very great loss if Dr. Reich should in any way be prevented fromobtaining a full opportunity to work out his ideas and scientific discoveries.... My statement is perhaps further strengthened by the fact that it comesfrom a man who does not share Dr. Reich’s radical opinions, nor his sympathieswith Marxist philosophy. I usually consider myself to be an old-fashioned, almostconservative liberal30.The second foreign supporter was A. S. Neill, founder and director of the pioneer-ing progressive school Summerhill in England. Neill had independently evolved and prac-ticed at Summerhill many ofthe same principles ofselfregulation Reich had elucidated.Neill’s controversial books had made Summerhill known throughout the world. In 1936,Reich attended a lecture Neill gave in Oslo. Neill, who had just read The Mass Psychology ofFascismwith considerable excitement, later phoned Reich, who invited the educator to din-ner. In Neill’s words about that first encounter: “We sat till far into the morning. If I remem-ber aright his English was just as bad as my German, so that he spoke his language and Imine. On departing I said, ‘Reich, you are the man I’ve been looking for for years, the manwho joins up the somatic with the psychological. Can I come to you as a student?’ ”31Reich agreed, and Neill, fourteen years Reich’s senior, became not only Reich’s patient overthe next two years but also his good friend until Reich’s death.On June 25, Neill published a letter in the Norwegian press:To me the campaign against Reich seems largely ignorant and uncivilized,more like fascism than democracy... . The question is not: Is Reich a bad person, ascoundrel destroying morale? The question isIs Reich a useful person who is bring-17 : The Bions: 1936-1939219éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"ing new knowledge to the world? For my part I feel that he is, and I say so as aScotsman, who would not waste time travelling to Oslo [to see Reich] if I did notknow that I would get my money’s worth32.The “Reich affair” put the Norwegian visa authorities on the spot. On the onehand, such leading scientific personages as Kreyberg, Thjotta, and Scharffenberg haddenounced him and argued against any extension. In addition, Reich was working at least onthe border of medical practice without proper certification. The opinion of the university’sFaculty of Medicine had been sought regarding Reich’s residence permit. A committee lim-ited itself to stating that his continued presence in Norway was not essential in terms of hismedical contribution33.On the other hand, Reich was defended by a number of prominent persons, includ-ing reputable psychiatrists and psychologists who insisted on Reich’s significance as a psy-choanalytic pioneer, a well-documented fact. The whole affair had taken on a “civil liberties” dimension—and Norway prided itselfon its intellectual tolerance. Only a year or so earlier the authorities had violated this tradi-tion when, under Soviet pressure, they had expelled Trotsky.* They wanted no repetition ofthe protests connected with that decision.A compromise was found. Reich was permitted to stay, but suddenly a royal decreewent into effect that anybody who practiced psychoanalysis or psychotherapy had to have aspecial government license. (Current Norwegian therapists are still bedeviled by this monar-chic requirement.) It was generally understood that such a license would be refused to Reich.Reich took the position that his psychiatric work had advanced to the point whereit could no longer be considered psychoanalysis or psychotherapy. Hence he never request-ed a license and the authorities had no chance to refuse him one. Nor did the authorities actagainst his continuing to carry out therapy because by early 1939 Reich had decided to emi-grate to the United States.He felt that the constant publicity combined with the continuingpractical difficulties made Norway no longer the hospitable environment it had been untillate in 1937.I have given only a scant picture of how bitter the press campaign in Norwaybecame. Between September 1937 and the fall of 1938, over a hundred articles denouncingReich appeared in the leading Oslo newspapers. His supporters got their share of space, butthey were usually on the defensive, responding to one or another charge of the critics.Moreover, with a few exceptions his supporters came from avant-gardecircles. The weight ofestablished scientific opinion ran against Reich.Throughout the outcry Reich himself issued only one public statement, the requestfor a commission to replicate his experiments. He continued working productively through-out the period. But the pressures markedly affected his personality and his relationships withElsa and colleagues. He felt enraged and humiliated by the notoriety he had acquired; he wasMyron SharafFury On Earth220éditionsles atomes de l’âme* Reich and Trotsky met briefly while the latter was still in Oslo, but I do not know any details of this meeting.."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"no longer comfortable in public. As I have suggested, he saw in such onslaughts one kindof index of the power of his work. But they also shook his self-confidence and reinforcedhis sense, acquired from the childhood tragedies, of being a “marked man.”If Reich refrained from denouncing his opponents in public, he did not remainquiet in private. To the growing roll of his enemies were now added the “Scharffenbergs,Kreybergs, and Hoffmanns,” whom he would bitterly denounce as late as the 19508. In qui-eter moments he might recall their activities, shake his head slowly, and remark: “What a wayto go into the history books—as my enemies!”17 : The Bions: 1936-1939221éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"18 : Psychiatric Developments: 1934-1939When Reich presented his paper on “Psychic Contact and Vegetative Current” atthe 1934 Lucerne Congress, he focused, as we have seen, on various somatic manifestationsin his patients. Thus, in one patient he noted the phenomenon of “penis anesthesia,” theexperience of tactile but not pleasurable sensations when the penis was touched.During the Norwegian years, Reich’s observations of and direct work with thepatient’s body increased markedly. His clinical work had been taking him in that directionsince at least 1930. Now his bio-electrical experiments focused on the flow of electricity aswell as body fluids in pleasure and anxiety. In addition, his highly sensuous relationship withElsa, their shared common interest in bodily expression and movement heightened his sen-sitivity to variations in emotional changes as they manifested themselves in differing color,temperature, and expression. Finally, he felt freer to break two strong psychoanalytic taboosthe taboo against touching the patient and the taboo —against seeing the patient undressed.According to analytic theory, the patient should not be touched because touch pro-vided gratification. The point of analysis was to establish and analyze the transference neu-rosis—the repetition of old loves and hates for significant persons in the past, especially thepatient’s parents. The analyst was to be neutral, a “blank screen,” to which the patient could“transfer” the complex relationship he or she experienced with parents. Touching would vio-late the principle of analytic neutrality.The taboo against the patient being undressed had a similar basis. The nudity orsemi-nudity of the patient would heighten the erotic meanings of the present analytic situ-ation,thereby confusing the working through of the past with all its unconscious infantilesexual conflicts. Freud had worked hard to separate psychoanalysis from the usual medicalprocedures,procedures of examining and treating patients who, indeed, were oftenundressed for better observation and palpation.Finally, apart from any theoretical concerns, psychoanalysts had reason to be upsetby any touching of the patient or seeing him or her in the nude. For long they had defend-ed themselves against the accusation that they advocated a wild acting out of sexuality, insideor outside the analytic situation.It had taken concerted efforts to convince professional andpublic opinion that their goal was to analyze sexual conflicts, not conduct or condone orgies.Reich moved slowly in breaking away from these rules. In the early years of hisfocus on the body, he limited himself largely to commenting on various muscular spasms.Then gradually,in the late 1930s, he began making more intensive use of touch to attack thebody armor directly and elicit emotions bound up in muscular spasms. He would press hardMyron SharafFury On Earth222éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"with his thumb or the palm of his hand on a particular segment of body armor, the jaw,neck, chest, back, or thigh. Such pressure often stimulated an outburst of crying or rage. Hiskind of touch should not be confused with any massage technique. It was generally direct-ed toward the release of emotion but was itself usually affectively neutral and somewhatmedical. I would note here that in devising the method of psychoanalysis, Freud had sharplymoved away from his earlier use of hypnosis, which at times included massage of thepatient. This “laying on of hands” had unsavory connections with the methods of FranzMesmer, an eighteenth-century physician and therapeutic innovator whose techniques werecriticized for, among other dangers, arousing female patients sexually. In my view, it was aremnant of Reich’s psychoanalytic superego and reflected his fear of association withpornography that he only occasionally used physical contact in a supportive, comforting way.In the 1940s, Alexander Lowen, then a young therapist in training with Reich, mentionedthat he had inadvertently left his hand resting on the patient’s back, and the patient had com-mented on how good it felt. Reich reflected, then commented without committing himself:“The analysts would call that seductive.”1Reich also moved gradually and incompletely with regard to the patient’s nudityduring therapy. He saw Raknes in shorts and nude by 19382. He always saw female patientsclothed in bra and panties. Reich drew some lines out of social concern: rumors were rifethat he was seducing his female patients.Touching the patient and seeing the patient either in the nude or seminude remaintwo of the most controversial aspects of Reichian technique, especially in established circles.The focus on touching and nudity has tended to obscure Reich’s central therapeutic endeav-or: the dissolution of characterological and muscular rigidities, the eliciting of strong emo-tions and energy “streamings,” the working through of the anxiety connected with pleasur-able sensations, and the establishment of orgastic potency. Reich summarized his therapeu-tic advances of the mid-1930s in a monograph entitled Orgasmusreflex, Muskelhahung, undKorperausdruck(Orgasm Reflex, Muscular Attitude, and Bodily Expression),which was published inI9373.One of his new and important emphases was on respiration:The respiratory disturbances in neurotics are the result of abdominal ten-sions...What is the function ofthis attitude ofshallow respiration? If we look atthe position of the inner organs and their relation to the solar plexus, we see imme-diately what we are dealing with. In fright, one involuntarily breathes in; as forinstance in drowning, where this very inspiration leads to death; the diaphragm con-tracts and compresses the solar plexus from above. A full understanding of thismuscular action is provided by the results of the character-analytic investigation ofearly infantile mechanisms. Children fight lasting and painful anxiety states, whichare accompanied by typical sensations in the belly by holding their breath. They dothe same thing when they have pleasurable sensations in the abdomen or in the gen-itals and are afraid ofthem4.18 : Psychiatric Developments: 1934-1939223éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Respiration came to play a role in Reich’s therapy, which he now termed “charac-ter-analytic vegetotherapy,” * comparable to the role of free association in psychoanalysis.In psychoanalysis, one is told to “say everything that comes into one’s mind,” with the ana-lyst pointing out the ways that one “resists” this “fundamental rule.” Correspondingly, inReich’s therapy, the patient is asked to lie down and to breathe. Then attention is called to avariety of ways in which he or she “resists” natural inspiration and expiration. He may betold that he breathes in fully, but lets little air out; or that the chest does not move; or thathe huffs and puffs unnaturally.When the patient’s breathing was shallow or forced, Reich would make use oftouch to stimulate an emotional flow and, with it, fuller respiration. After deep sobbing,especially, the patient would breathe more freely. During the Norwegian period, the patientwas also urged to talk a good deal about his current problems, his feelings toward Reich, andhis childhood experiences. Just as Reich had always noted whether the patient spoke withappropriate emotion, now he noted, too, changes in respiration with particular topics.While Reich was dealing with blocked respiration, he was noting—and helping thepatient to experience—a variety of other distorted emotional expressions. Thus in his 1937monograph,Reich mentioned a female patient whose face had a striking expression of“indifference.” Reich called this expression to her attention; the patient experienced it morekeenly and connected it with other aspects of her personality. Then another expression inthe lower part of her face emerged. “It became clear that the mouth and chin were ‘angry’while the eyes and forehead were ‘dead.’ ”5With attention called to the mouth and chin,the patient developed strong impulses to bite—impulses she once felt toward her father andnow felt toward her husband. After expressing the biting impulses, the mouth and chin soft-ened and the patient experienced a flow of sensation through her body. However, genitalexcitation was still inhibited.Reich noted that, with the increase of sensation, the expression in her eyes changedfrom one ofindifference to an angry, critical gaze. In their investigation, Reich and thepatient detected that her eyes and forehead “watched closely what the genital was doing.”Moreover, exploration of the patient’s past yielded the finding that the severe expression of eyes and forehead derived from an identificationwith her father who was a very ascetic person. ... He had again and again impressedon her the danger of giving in to sexual desires. Thus, the attitude of the foreheadMyron SharafFury On Earth224éditionsles atomes de l’âme*The “character-analytic”part ofthis term denotes the continuity of Reich’s evolving treatment with psycho-analysis and his contributions to it. “Vegetotherapy” stems from “vegetative nervous system,” a commonly usedterm for the “autonomic nervous system.” As we saw in Chapter 16, Reich was ever more impressed with the roleof sympathetic innervation in neuroses and the importance of parasympathetic activation during therapy. Overall,the term “vegetotherapeutic” reflected his increasing interest in the bodily expression of emotions and energeticchanges in the patient. In America, however, he abandoned the term because of its unfortunate associations with“vegetables” and “vegetate.”"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"had taken the place of the father in guarding against sexual temptation. ... To thesame extent to which the “dead” expression was replaced by the “critical” expres-sion, the defense against genitality became accentuated... . With the final disappear-ance of the critical attitude of the forehead and its replacement by the cheerful atti-tude, the inhibition of genital excitation disappeared also6.Reich’s vignette provides a good example of the interweaving of his observationsof the patient’s bodily expression, her characterological attitudes, and her early history. Yetit was a great oversimplification of what happened in the typical course of therapy.What has this to do with respiration, the starting point of Reich’s therapy? The con-nection is in fact straightforward: the release of blocked feeling, through the expression ofrage or sorrow, was usually accompanied by freer, fuller, easier breathing. Reich would care-fully note ways the patient would “shut down” a particular feeling, both mentally, by beingashamed of sobbing, considering it self-indulgent; and physically, by constricting the throat,tightening the mouth and chin, raising the chest and—above—all by stopping full exhala-tion. (He once described deep sobbing as the “great softener” of the whole musculature.) During the 1930s, Reich developed a keen eye for the ways the muscular armor wasexpressed in different segments of the body—how it looked to the observer, how it wassubjectively experienced, the signs of its incipient dissolution, and the anxieties that accom-panied freer feeling, particularly genital excitation, when the armor was more fully dissolved.Thus, the forehead might looktense, with eyebrows raised and a haughty expression of theeyes; the patient might feela “band around the forehead” or complain of headaches. Patientsmight have a masklike expression around the mouth, chin, and neck; or their voice might below, monotonous, “thin.” “One only has to imagine that one is trying to suppress an impulseto cry; one will find that the muscles of the floor of the mouth become very tense, the mus-cles of the whole head become tense, the chin is pushed forward and the mouth becomessmall.”7Characteristic expressions ofother “armor segments” are a tight, forward-juttingchest, especially pronounced in the “he man”; a hunch of the shoulders, as though one isperpetually carrying a big burden; contracting the diaphragm with a resultant feeling of“pressure” or a “tight band” just above the stomach; an arched back with a retracted pelvisand a protrusion of the upper abdomen and chest; and a dead, heavy, lifeless expression inthe legs.From the very beginning of his work on bodily expression, Reich focused on start-ing the armor dissolution farthest from the genitals. Characteristically, he would begin withfacial expressions, the expressions which strike the observer first and which the patient ismore likely to be aware of than other armor segments.Reich’s vegetotherapeutic work during the 1930s influenced his thinking about thegoal of treatment. In the broadest sense, the goal remained the same—the establishment oforgastic potency. However, direct work on the body permitted Reich to see a kind of minia-ture model of orgastic potency within the therapeutic session. If the therapist worked cor-18 : Psychiatric Developments: 1934-1939225éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"rectly, he could observe, after the dissolution of the armor segments, that not only was therespiration felt all through the body, with sensations of pleasure following expiration, but awave of spontaneous, involuntary movements went through the body from the throatdownward and upward. If the patient lay on his back with his knees raised to an angle ofabout forty-five degrees, breathing deeply and freely, his head would tilt slightly backward,his shoulders slightly forward, the chest and the belly would sink and the pelvis raise itselfslightly from the couch, all these movements accompanying the exhalation in one wave.In one of the first patients whom Reich treated with his new armordissolving tech-nique, the spontaneous movements became quite reflex-like and so strong that they couldbe held back only with an effort. Reich termed these movements the “orgasm reflex,”because they also appeared during orgasm in orgastically potent persons.The attainment of the orgasm reflex during therapy, as well as of orgastic potencyin sexual intercourse, became the twin goals of Reich’s treatment. It should be noted thatthe orgasm reflex in therapy could be experienced without the sharp rise and discharge ofexcitation characteristic of orgasm. The sine qua nonwere strong sensations of pleasurablecurrents throughout the body, particularly in the pelvic area, and spontaneous, convulsive-like free movements of the whole body. As Alexander Lowen noted from his own treatmentwith Reich,it is possible to experience the orgasme reflex without beeing orgastically potentin intercourse8. The former was simpler. One had the encouragement oFthe therapist andlacked all the problems involved in relating to a love partner in “real life.”However, in therapy Reich and the patient were able to observe directly many ofthe phenomena patients had previously only relatedfrom their sexual experiences. During theend phases of treatment, some patients had reported difficulty in giving up hard, jerkymovements during intercourse and replacing them with softer, more gentle ones. The samephenomenon was apparent in therapy: as the orgasm reflex developed, the patient wouldsubstitute—as a way of controlling the intensity of the excitation—exaggerated, artificialmotions for the involuntary convulsions. Or he or she would suddenly become very still, asin intercourse.Observing the naked or near-naked body directly, concentrating his focus on bod-ily changes, Reich was getting to where he had long wanted to be: a therapy that elicited anddealt with the deepest emotions and with the flow ofenergy, which he now named “bio-electricity.” Reich loved the concrete, the tangible. The study of the “end phase” of therapypresented in condensed form the Reichian world—the world of intense sensation, of softmovements culminating in convulsions of the body (the orgasm reflex). This was in sharpcontradistinction to the enemy within—tightenings of the throat, the pelvis, and the legs;restriction ofbreathing, dulling of the eyes; expressions of intense anxiety; and the reemer-gence of defensive character traits. These phenomena intensified in the face of increasing-ly free, pleasurable sensations, sensations that in turn increased “orgasm anxiety” or the fearof full surrender. Now Reich’s talent for observing transitions could most fully be employed,as he observed a vague look in the patient’s eye, a sly smile, a restriction in breathing rightat the moment of genital excitation or the beginning of a “shutdown” of excitation.Myron SharafFury On Earth226éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"There were of course difficulties involved for the patient, such as very strong bod-ily reactions, which could sometimes even be dangerous. This was one of the factors thatled Reich to believe his therapy should only be practiced by physicians. He was willing tomake exceptions—Ola Raknes, for example—but in general he held to the medical practiceof his therapy.These difficulties, together with the kind of rigor Reich advocated for the totaltreatment, made him uneasy about the popularization of such therapy. He feared thatuntrained persons might pick up his techniques and then commit irresponsible blunderswith patients or simply dilute them and so render them “superficial” As he wrote in the pref-ace to his 1937 monograph, he had not solved an old dilemma. His social self, his Marxistself, demanded the popularization of scientific knowledge. But at the same time, “I wouldlike to prevent the expression ‘vegetotherapy’ from becoming a fashionable slogan amongother fashionable causes. ... The more generally a scientific formulation is valid, the stricterone must be in the demand for serious and deep-going popularization.”9Reich never found the means to achieve a “serious and deep-going popularization”of his therapeutic work. Indeed, in Norway and even more when he got to America, hemoved in the opposite direction. He tried to keep a tight rein on those who utilized his tech-niques,for he was terribly afraid that his concepts and techniques would be misused to thedetriment not only of patients but of his own work and his person.In today’s climate, it is easy to forget how radical Reich’s approaches were for the1930s and 1940s. At that time, traditional psychiatry used organic treatments such as elec-troshock therapy. Psychoanalysts—Freudians, Adlerians, or Jungians—limited themselvesstrictly to talking with patients. Now the already controversial Reich was seeing patients nudeor semi-nude, touching them, reporting about all kinds of sexual excitations, including theorgasm reflex, during therapy. It was a volatile atmosphere, and Reich did not want a sparklit by the suicide or mistreatment of a patient allegedly treated by a “Reichian” therapistwhose work he himself had not approved.There were also other, less rational, motives behind the control Reich attempted tokeep on his therapy (as well as on other aspects of his work), behind his avoidance of super-ficial “popularization.”In the late 1920s and early 1930s, he had moved toward the widestpossible distribution of his sex-political concepts. He had printed brochures in simple, clearlanguage and distributed them by the thousands to the Communist Party and other organi-zations. He had worked also to train nonprofessional “youth leaders” on sexual issues. Nowhe was limiting himself to writing in his small, obscure JournalMoreover, he never describedhis therapeutic techniques in great detail, partly out of the fear that the untrained might usesuch a “cookbook” to conduct “wild” therapy.I would suggest that in his early deep concern for helping humanity, Reich was notmotivated solely by his genuine compassion for “people in trouble.” In Freudian terms, healso had a rescue fantasy,a desire to save the world, with a concomitant overestimation ofthe world’s desire and capacity to be saved. With this went his often quite unrealistically opti-18 : Psychiatric Developments: 1934-1939227éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"mistic view of people’s readiness for rapid change, whether individually or socially.A different set of motives, related to his family tragedy, was operative in the late1930s and 1940s. As Reich’s sense of his own work developed, as it became clear that he wasnot simply continuing psychoanalysis or Marxism, that he was no longer the “son” but nowthe “father” of new disciplines, he became quite concerned with the priority of his therapy,his sex-economy, his bio-electrical and bion experiments. Others might somehow run offwith his discoveries, and “wear them in the world’s eyes as though they’d wrought them,” toborrow from Yeats. Not only would they steal his discoveries. They might dilute them, and,in diluting them, defile them. They would steal and defile, but not suffer, truly suffer forthem, as he had suffered.In the 1930s and after, his accusations became ever harsher against those hebelieved were stealing his work. However much someone like Fenichel may have deservedreprimand, Reich’s ferocity was undoubtedly excessive. His accusations were clearly directedto someone else, another person who had been close to Reich—in other words, the tutorwho slept with his mother, who had “stolen” the mother from Willy and his father, who had(in Willy’s mind) defiled his mother. The tutor had also gotten off easily, compared to thesuffering of Willy and his father.As Reich became a father,the father of a new therapy and a new science, he becamemore like his own father, especially under stress. And, in particular, the negative aspects ofhis father—the jealousy, possessiveness, demandingness, the high expectations of “sons”and the difficulty in accepting their independence—now came to the fore.How much of psychoanalysis was in fact retained in what Reich termed “character-analytic vegetotherapy”? In the 1930s, at least, Reich still paid attention to one cardinal goal of psycho-analysls—the resurrection and making conscious of unconscious memories. As with char-acter analysis,he claimed that vegetotherapy brought back these memories with more vivid-ness than classical analysis. To quote from his 1937 monograph again:The dissolution ofa muscular rigidity not only liberates vegetative energy,but,in addition,also brings back into memory the very infantile situation in whichthe repression had taken place We can say: everymuscular rigidity contains the histo-ry and the meaning of its origine. It is thus not necessary to deduce from dreams orassociations [patient productions Reich was never especially interested in] the way inwhich the muscular armor developed; rather, the armor itself is the form in whichthe infantile experience continues to exist as a harmful agent10.Reich claimed even more. Work on the muscular armor brought up memories withmore affect and immediate significant insight by the patient than was the case in psycho-analysis.In the same monograph he cites a patient who suffered a severe anxiety attack dur-ing a session. The man suddenly sat up with a painfully distorted mouth, his forehead cov-Myron SharafFury On Earth228éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"ered with perspiration, his whole musculature tense. He hallucinated an ape and emittedsounds that seemed to come from the depth of his chest. This intense experience was imme-diately connected with frightening childhood memories of his father, a figure he as a smallchild had perceived as a terrible “gorilla” interfering with the little boy’s relation with hismother11.Again and again, Reich stresses the vivid reenactment of early memories throughwork on the musculature. At the same time, his thinking was moving away from ideationalmemories and toward total concentration on the play of forces between tthe flow of ener-gy and emotion, on the one hand, and the muscular rigidities and fear of pleasure, on theother.Several technical points also reflect the continuity with psychoanalysis, as well as thegrowing divergencies. During the Norwegian period, Reich saw patients at least several timesa week. (Typical analysis involved five sessions each week.) Later, in America, he would seemany patients once a week, though he felt that two or three weekly sessions were optimal Reich also always saw the patient lying down. Just as psychoanalysis assumed thatthe supine position increased regression and the “relaxation” of controlled thought process-es, so Reich thought this position heightened the flow of emotion.* Reich maintained a very professional relationship with his patients; there was nodoubt who was the therapist, who the patient. However, he always believed in behaving ashumanly as possible:Many psychoanalytic rules had the definite character of taboos, and thusonly reinforced the neurotic taboos of the patient. Thus, for example, the rule thatthe analyst should not be seen, that he should be a blank screen, as it were, uponwhich the patient would project his transferences. This, instead of eliminating, con-firmed in the patient the feeling of dealing with an invisible, unapproachable,superhuman, that is, according to infantile thinking, a sexless being. How could thepatient overcome his fear ofsex which made him ill? Treated thus, sexualityremained forever something diabolical and forbidden, something which under allcircumstances was to be “condemned” or “sublimated” ... I attempted in every pos-sible way to free them of their characterological rigidity. They should look at me inan unauthoritative,humanway12.In line with letting the patient see the therapist, and also permitting the therapist toobserve the patient,Reich sat next to him rather than behind him (the customary analyticposition). Sometimes, too, Reich would answer questions the patient asked about him, ratherthan using the more standard analytic technique of querying: “Why do you ask?”In contrast to the usual analytic mode, then, Reich could be revealing of himself.18 : Psychiatric Developments: 1934-1939229éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Ofthose working directly in the Reichian tradition, Alexander Lowen was the first (in the late 1950s) to makeuse ofother patient positions,especially standing."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"He could also demonstrate the negative sides of the human therapist—the sides the analystsso rightly warn against. For all his theoretical commitment to the patient’s “overcoming anyfear of criticizing me,” he could become extremely angry at patients both in Norway andlater in America. This was particularly likely to occur when he was being criticized indirect-ly.Thus Reich sometimes violated the good part of the analyst’s neutrality, his basicaccepting and nonjudgmental stance, his refusal to repeat old sadomasochistic struggles withthe patient. In therapy, as in most of his other endeavors, Reich was a man of extremes. Athis best, he played in a league all his own. At his worst, he made mistakes a first-year psychi-atric resident (or physicist or biologist) wouldn’t make.What are the connections between Reich’s psychiatric treatment and his experimen-tal work—in this period, his bio-electrical and bion research? I have already suggested some mutual interaction. Thus around 1933 Reich hadnoted “dead spots” in the organism, for example, penis anesthesia. The bio-electric experi-ments in 1935 objectively confirmed for Reich the lack of flow or charge when pleasure wasnot experienced. Conversely, the experiments heightened his confidence that he was observ-ing a flow of measurable energy in his patients.The study ofmicroorganisms, particularly cell division, renewed Reich’s convictionduring this period that in the case of orgasm reflex and orgastic potency, he was dealing withbasic life processes, processes that transcended purely psychological phenomena. He beganto look at the patient not—or not only—in terms of his or her various conflicts and partic-ular life experiences, but, in words he once used, as “a sack of fluids and energy.”13Theissue was what prevented that “sack” from pulsating freely and from discharging excessenergy through the orgasm. The softening in the laboratory of the rigid structure of matterleading to pulsating bions became analogous to the softening of the patient’s armor, whichled to the eliciting of strong, involuntary emotions.Reich was getting a largely negative response from the world for his experimentalwork,and no more than lukewarm tolerance from his friends, as we have seen. But he wasable to derive positive “feedback” indirectly. His students and patients were enormouslyenthusiastic about his therapeutic work. The gratitude they expressed when their rigiditiessoftened,when energy flowed freely, could not help but give him greater confidence in thevalidity of the “pulsations” he observed.For a time Reich considered calling his treatment “orgasmotherapy,” but decidedthat this frank nomenclature would be too overwhelming for his students14. His treatmentwas not a “direct sex therapy” in the current sense of that term. Rather, he contended thatblocks in the function of the orgasm were connected with blocks in the total character andmusculature. These had to be worked through before the total orgastic convulsions—notsimply local genital release such as Masters and Jonson would later describe—could occur.The person who could not cry deeply or express his or her rage freely could also not, accord-ing to Reich,convulse orgastically. His treatment thus concerned the whole organism, notjust the patient’s sexuality.Myron SharafFury On Earth230éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Finally, what is the relation between Reich’s vegetotherapy and current forms oftreatment such as primal scream therapy, Gestalt therapy, bio-energetics, and encountergroups? Bio-energetics should be separated from this grouping because it essentially repre-sents, as Lowen has pointed out, a popularization and amplification of Reich’s work andhence is a direct descendant of it. The other schools make use of various Reichian tech-niques. Primal scream, for example, works with direct touch of the body and is orientedaround deep emotional expression, Gestalt therapy involves considerable emphasis onawareness of body feelings but does not directly use touch. Encounter groups employ a vari-ety of methods to get people “out of their heads” and “into their feelings.”None of these techniques involves a systematic working through of layered char-acter defenses and segments of muscular armor. None postulates the release of an energyfrom these blocked defenses. None has the treatment goal of orgastic potency or orgasmreflex. In a later chapter I will consider the question of how effective Reich was in achiev-ing his goal with patients and why he believed it was so important to maintain the principleof orgastic potency as the criterion of health quite distinct from the therapist’s success inreaching this goal It is enough here to emphasize Reich’s extraordinary pioneering contribu-tions of the 1930s to classical theory and practice—contributions that were guided by hisown relentless quest to comprehend the nature oflife energy and what, in man, might blockits spontaneous flow.18 : Psychiatric Developments: 1934-1939231éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"19 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1934-1939The three years between the fall of 1934 and the fall of 1937 were among the hap-piest in Reich’s life. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg continued to be a very satisfyingone. Reich was supportive of Elsa’s work, acting on his belief in marital partners’ exercisingtheir independence. Elsa, whose political interests were stronger than Reich’s at thisparticu-lar time, was an occasional choreographer for a “Red Review” put on by a young workers’group. Once when Reich came to a rehearsal and helped with the drilling of a Prussiangoose-step routine, Elsa recalled the warm, direct way he had with these young workers, andhow everybody enjoyed a big party afterward1.Reich and Annie were divorced in late 1934. Reich had considered Elsa to be hiswife in all but the legal sense for some time, at least since she joined him in Copenhagen inMay 1933. He was reluctant to take the step of marriage with Elsa, in part because of thepotential for bitter harassment in the case of a subsequent divorce, in part because he want-ed to be very certain that their personal relationship harmonized with his rapidly develop-ing work.In the early Oslo years at least, there was less reluctance on Elsa’s part. When shebecame pregnant in 1935, she was overjoyed to have a child with Willy. Initially, he too wasthrilled by the prospect and bought clothes and furniture for the coming infant. But thendoubts set in. He felt that the future of his work was too unsettled to provide the right kindofenvironment for a child.To Elsa’s great sorrow, he insisted on an abortion2.They decid-ed to have the abortion in Berlin, where Edith Jacobson, still practicing analysis and nowalso in the German resistance movement against Hitler, helped arrange the illegal operation.During this period,Reich’s relations with his colleagues were also harmonious. TheNorwegian group was an exceptionally lively one. Both Sigurd and Nic Hoel, and people likeArnulf Overland, poet laureate of Norway, and August Lange, a well-known sociologist,were friends as well as colleagues. There were parties, skiing vacations, and informal meet-ings, together with courses and the diverse work collaborations Reich usually had with hisassociates.In the summer of1935 a kind of summer school developed, with seminars andlectures; mostly friends, students, and assistants gathered informally in the Norwegian coun-tryside. As Use Ollendorff has noted:The atmosphere was casual, in great contrast to the much more formal climate thatwas to prevail in the American organization later on. ... In my request for information inScandinavia,I was struck again and again by the way people referred to Reich as Willy. Noone in America, except his closest family, and some of his old friends from Austria, everMyron SharafFury On Earth232éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"referred to him as Willy. He was always Reich to a few, and Dr. Reich to most3.Early in the Oslo period, the controversy with Otto Fenichel erupted again.Fenichel had migrated to Oslo before Reich. Nic Hoel and Ola Raknes started psychoana-lytic treatment with Fenichel, although their first choice was Reich. Later, both transferredfrom Fenichel to Reich, exacerbating the friction between the two men. Hoel and Raknes,along with Schjelderup, very much wanted Reich to join the Scandinavian PsychoanalyticInstitute and thereby be reinstated within the International Association. Moreover, they wereprepared to take the risk, threatened by the International executive committee, of the exclu-sion of their Institute should Reich become a member. Fenichel, however, was opposed. Hewas not prepared to face exclusion, believing the best way he could serve the cause of psy-choanalysis was to remain a member of the Association fighting for those scientific direc-tions he supported4.As we saw earlier, Reich was quite ambivalent about rejoining the InternationalAssociation. On the one hand, he felt his work was so different from the dominant trendswithin the psychoanalytic establishment that he did not belong there. On the other hand, hefelt that any continuer of the true analytic tradition did belong. In any case, he deeply resent-ed Fenichel’s opposition, which whetted his appetite for readmission.A meeting was held in Oslo on December 14, 1935, attended by Reich, Fenichel,Nic Hoel, Raknes, and other members of the “opposition group” of analysts, to discuss,among other things, the question of Reich’s relationship to the Scandinavian Institute.Fenichel clearly had the better of the argument on several points raised. For example, evenafter the events of Lucerne, Reich still continued to believe that he could count on consid-erable endorsement among the rank-and-file members of the International Association, anopinion fueled by hope rather than realistic assessment. In a paroxysm of blame, Reichaccused Fenichel at the December 14 meeting of not explaining to potentially supportiveanalysts just where Reich’s concepts and late Freudian views differed. On his side, Fenichelhad no such illusions about the degree ofeffective allegiance his adversary could rally. Reichalso still believed that the psychoanalytic organization had to take a political stance, now notwith the Communist Party per se, but in “the camp of the political left.” Understandably,Fenichel saw this demand as unnecessary provocation to the more conservative analysts5.Equally, Reich was right about the originality of his orgasm theory. Fenichelbelieved that Reich’s genitality concepts substantially stemmed from Freud. Reich arguedthat a consistent and radically new elucidation of the psychological, sociological, and phys-iological aspects of the orgasm was a quite different matter from Freud’s early but scatteredreferences. Yet for a long time Reich himself had not been entirely clear about the precisedifferences between himself and Freud. His expectation of clarity on Fenichel’s part led toa comical interlude at the December meeting when Reich said: “I myself have only realizedover the last three months why and how the orgasm theory so absolutely comradicts deathinstinct theory.” Fenichel interjected the ironic comment: “And during the preceding years,Inever explained to youwhy and how you differed from Freud?” Reich angrily: “No, you didnot!”which was followed by an outburst of laughter from those present, the point of which19 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1934-1939233éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"escaped him. Reich’s ludicrous moments—and he had many—often helped to obscure fromhis contemporaries the magnitude of his accomplishments.A difference of opinion had fused with a personal rivalry. Fenichel, a man of for-midable intellectual gifts, was about the same age as Reich and had introduced his friend topsychoanalysis back in medical school days. It could not have been easy for him to be inReich’s shadow. Such a position was tolerable if painful when Reich led an “opposition”group within psychoanalysis. Then they were both the intellectual children of Freud; in fact,Fenichel was much better versed than Reich in the details of Freud’s writings and those ofother analytic theorists. (To use Isaiah Berlin’s classification, Fenichel was a fox, Reich ahedgehog: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”) It wasquite a different, indeed an intolerable thing for Fenichel to do what Reich now demandedof him: to join the grandchildren such as Hoel and Raknes in sharp, passionate commitmentto Reich’sconcepts, to risk being cut down in the volley of shots aimed at Reich by the psy-choanalytic establishment.The controversy between Reich and Fenichel was further fanned by Reich’s stu-dents. Some attended Reich’s seminars, which were held separately from the NorwegianPsychoanalytic Institute; a few were in analysis with Fenichel, and Nic Hoel reported on thissituation:“When I said positive things about Reich, FenichePs movements became nervousand his voice shrill, even if he only said ‘yes’ and ‘no.’ ” When she broke off treatment withFenichel after a year to join Reich, she sensed that Fenichel was furious6. Raknes main-tained that while Fenichel never said outright that Reich was psychotic, he implied as much7.Further, Fenichel resented those students of Reich who came to the analytic meetings andin the discussions made issues of the differences between himself and Reich. Whetheroppressed by antagonisms between the two groups, or fearful that he was losing patients toReich, Fenichel decided to leave Oslo at the end of 1935 to settle in Prague.The long relationship between Fenichel and Reich was now over, leaving only bit-ter enmity between the two.Neither man ever expressed in writing the sorrow he felt at therupture. Fenichel, according to his former wife, was very depressed by the controversy8.And Elsa Lindenberg has reported that Reich could not understand why Fenichel was soangry toward him. More typically, his hurt over Fenichel’s behavior was expressed in rage.The “Fenichels” now joined the “Scharffenbergs” and “Kreybergs” in Reich’s roll call ofenemies,people who were frightened by his work and who, unable to follow, had resortedto slandering him.With Fenichel gone, Reich was clearly dominant among Norwegian analysts, eventhough he was no longer an analyst himself. Some of his students—Schjelderap and Hoel,for example—remained members of the Psychoanalytic Institute; others, such as OlaRaknes, dropped their membership as Reich’s work evolved away from psychoanalysis andas his emotional stand hardened against his former analytic colleagues.Reich may have left the analytic establishment, but his feelings for Freud remainedas intense and conflicted as ever. According to Elsa Lindenberg, he debated for a long timewhether to send a congratulatory telegram on the occasion of Freud’s eightieth birthday onMyron SharafFury On Earth234éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"May 6, 1936. He finally decided to do so. Reich also published an article entitled “OurCongratulations to Freud on His Birthday,” which detailed what he believed to be the fruit-ful parts of Freud’s work, continued in sex-economy, and the more sterile tendencies thatincreasingly dominated psychoanalysis. The conclusion of the article stated: “No matterhow difficult or hurtful the conflicts between psychoanalysis and sex-economy may havebeen, they will never cause us to forget what we owe to the life work of Freud. For nobodyknows better than we, nobody experiences more painfully than we, why the world used todamn Freud and today removes him from a fighting reality.”9More painful than the break with Fenichel and Reich’s continuing disappointmentin Freud was Reich’s relationship with his children, especially Eva. When Reich moved toOslo, Eva and Lore were living in Vienna with Annie’s parents, Malva and Alfred Pink, whileAnnie was establishing her practice in Prague. Sometime in 1934 Eva went into child analy-sis with Berta Bornstein, a well-known Vienna child analyst trained by Anna Freud. BothAnnie and Willy agreed that Eva needed analysis and that Bornstein was a good choice. Eva’sanalysis with Bornstein was one of the reasons the children remained in Vienna. As agreed,Eva spent summers with her father10.Prior to the Reichs’ move to Berlin in 1930, Bornstein had been a good friend ofthe family. She had cared for Eva and Lore when the Reichs visited Russia in 1929. (Shenever married, but for a period in the 1920s she and Otto Fenichel were lovers.)11Following the Reichs’ separation, she sided strongly with Annie. In the 1930s her involve-ment with the family was not considered a counter-indication to her being Eva’s analyst.Today, such a practice would be strictly disadvised.Annie,Bornstein,and Alfred Pink had strongly objected to Reich’s “encouraging”the precocious Eva to attend his seminars and to read Malinowski’s The Sexual Life ofSavages.Pink clearly disapproved of his granddaughter’s “premature” sexual interests, a definite atti-tude Reich preferred to the tolerating stance of Annie and Bornstein, which allowed Eva tomake her own decisions rather than “imposing” a Weltanschauungthe way they claimed Reichdid12.Reich countered that he had not encouraged Eva but neither had he discouragedher spontaneous interest in these activities nor concealed his pleasure over her curiosity. Inhis view, to have done so would have contributed to the mystification of sexuality that result-ed from the vague disapproval or unspoken toleration of sexual curiosity.The same issue erupted again over an exchange of letters between Eva and Willy.On January 12, 1935, she wrote Reich about a matter that “I tell Berta only rarely.” Nowalmost eleven, Eva had met a thirteen-year-old boy, K. They liked each other, kissed, andengaged in sex play. But he also liked and went out with other girls. And that for Eva was aproblem:“I thought to myself, I won’t let anyone play around with me, and now I don’tknow what to do. To be mad or to be friends? I am disappointed but am I not right? I thinksometimes:‘Go back, retreat, you have no rights to him.’ But when he takes my hand I thinkthe opposite.... I am sick of the whole affair. ... It sounds like a love novel... ,”1319 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1934-1939235éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"According to Eva, Reich was concerned that she hadn’t told Berta about K. Evawas impressed with how seriously Reich took her feelings for K. and the clear, simple wayhe had advised her. He had said that perhaps she could overcome her jealousy and let K. seeothers as well as herself. On the other hand, her desire to have K. for herself might be soimportant that she could not share him. He also told her to look at her feelings of vanity.And even if she did lose K., she should remember she was a fine person and would soonhave another boyfriend.Bornstein believed that Eva was in part acting out her transference to Bornsteinthrough her relationship with K. Also, Eva was trying to play her father off against her ther-apist, a maneuver Reich had fallen for. Bornstein, Annie, and Alfred believed that Reich’s let-ter illustrated once again how he foisted his own views on her, views Eva parroted in orderto keep his love. Indeed, in their view, her relationship with K. was an effort to impress herfather with her interest in sexuality14.Caught between the very different lifestyles and orientations of her quarreling par-ents, Eva suffered considerable anguish. At the end of her visit to Willy in August 1935, shevery much wanted to spend the following year with him in Oslo. She found the impendingseparation extremely hard to bear: it reminded her of the pain she had experienced after theprevious year’s summer visit with Reich.Initially, Reich agreed to Eva’s wish. However, he wanted to consult with Annie,since their divorce agreement specified that the children remain with their mother until theyreached the age of fourteen, at which time they could make their own decision. TogetherEva and Willy went to Grundlsee, in Austria, where Annie, her husband Thomas Rubinstein,and Bornstein were vacationing. Annie adamantly refused to agree to Eva’s wish. Bornsteinand she felt that Eva should complete her analysis, which would not need much more time.According to Reich, Berta Bornstein stated that in all likelihood Eva could move to Oslo inthe spring of 1936 if she still wished to do so. Mollified, still partly convinced of the impor-tance of Eva’s analysis, and uncertain of his legal status as a controversial refugee in Oslo,Reich persuaded a very unhappy Eva to remain in Vienna until the following spring. Later,Reich believed that the ensuing events were partly due to his not taking a stronger stand inEva’s behalfthat fall15.After Reich returned to Oslo, Eva grew more fearful with her mother andBornstein and became much more distant toward her father. Indeed, she entirely relin-quished the idea ofliving with him and became very ambivalent even about visits. She chosenot to see him at Christmas 1935 or during the summer of 1936.When Eva refused to come for the summer visit, Reich became thoroughly con-vinced that Annie and Bornstein had unfairly alienated his daughter from him. A very angryReich visited his former wife and children, quite uninvited, at Marienbad where they werevacationing during August 1936. There were furious arguments between Reich and Annie(aided and abetted by Thomas and Berta). Reich repeated a request he had made many timesto Eva:that she come and live with him as she had wished to do a year earlier. Eva quotedBornstein as saying Reich was financially unreliable. At one point Annie bitterly declared sheMyron SharafFury On Earth236éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"wanted full custody of the children. She would forbid Eva from living with Reich even ifshe wished to do so. Reich became more enraged than ever. Finally, Eva told Willy to leave—he was upsetting everyone.Once back in Oslo in September, Reich took retaliatory steps. According to Eva,Reich now took the position that he would no longer give child support to Annie but wouldinstead put the money in escrow until the children visited and maintained a decent relation-ship with him. Around this time, Reich also began preparing an eighty-page document enti-tled “How I Lost Eva,” in which he detailed his anguish and tumult in letters, reports ofphone calls, and other recollections (plus his own interpretations) of events.There was no further communication between Eva and Reich until August 1938.Hitler had annexed Austria that March, and Annie made plans to emigrate from endangeredPrague to America. Reich was angry that he wasnot consulted and that the children did notvisit him before leaving. The move itself he thoroughly approved, being convinced thatHitler intended to conquer Europe and that the democracies were ill-prepared to meet thisthreat.Annie and the children arrived in the United States on July 21, 1938. Working on afarm during her first American summer, Eva, now fourteen years old, wrote her father onAugust 28:“It is the first time that I do something [writing Reich] which perhaps is not goodfor Annie, but I had this feeling, now or never, that I simply write it, throw it in the mailbox, and then will be sorry afterward.”Eva went on to speak of her love for both her mother and her father. About herfather: “Be proud that your daughter tells you that you have such charm that if one comesinto your vicinity one simply must be fond of you.” However, Eva was worried that she had“lost” Reich because she had been unwilling to visit him before leaving Europe. She stillfound it difficult “for me to be quite honest with you.” Hoping he would reply, she conclud-ed her letter by imagining Reich’s reaction to it: “You are a little confused and read the let-ter again and again.”16According to Eva,Reich replied with a brief letter. He was concerned that whatev-er he said might only serve to drive Eva back into her fear of him. He was extremely touchedthat for the first time in three years she had reached out to him, but he was worried that inso doing she felt guilty toward Annie. In fact, she was not harming her mother by writing tohim.Some years later, Reich told Eva how hurt he was that she had been so concernedabout her mother’s feelings should Eva approach him and so little concerned about his feel-ings should she not. The whole conflict, Reich said, arose because he represented the greatforbidden.Today, Eva Reich, who is a physician, travels around the world lecturing on herfather’s work. In interviews with me in the early 19705, she saw Annie, and especially BertaBornstein, as essentially responsible for the almost four years of fear-filled separation fromher father.They “brainwashed” her into believing her father was seductive and sick, hisinfluence on her largely destructive. Eva’s view of what happened received corroboration19 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1934-1939237éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"from Edith Jacobson, no friend of Reich’s by 1935-36 and certainly not by 1971, when Iinterviewed her. Jacobson entirely agreed with Bornstein’s diagnosis of Reich as very sick,but felt that Berta’s insistence on convincing Eva of this truth boomeranged, eventuallydriving Eva closer to her father.For all her commitment to Reich’s work today and for all her indignation towardBornstein and Annie for their role during her early adolescence, Eva still harbors resentmentthat Reich left the family. She also feels she was always undertaking things before she was ready—a sentiment that surely includes her fol-lowing some of Reich’s passions that he endeavored so hard to get others to share. In lateryears, Reich recognized his contribution to Eva’s childhood tragedy. He said he would nottry to influence his son Peter, born in America in 1944, to enter his work the way he hadtried to influence Eva17.If the situation was never black and white, neither was there equal responsibility forthe events. Reich’s central commitments were at stake in the battle over Eva. He believed inthe affirmation of genitality in a world that condemned it, and he was not prepared to sur-render this affirmation toward Eva in order “to keep peace in the family.” Only when hisgentle, understanding approach, as in his letter to Eva about her relationship with K., metcondemnation from Annie and Bornstein did he become harsher, more insistent in his deal-ings with Eva and her Viennese world, thereby exacerbating the parental division rather thanattempting to heal it.Moreover, Reich was open about his convictions. When he had questions aboutEva’s analysis, particularly her inability to speak freely to her therapist, he wanted Bornsteinas well as Eva to be fully informed of his concern. For her part, Annie prior to 1936 andBornstein throughout never fully revealed the extent of their radical disagreement withReich and their intense dislike of Eva’s relationship with him. They only kept repeating thepartial truth that they wanted Eva “to make up her own mind.”Finally, whatever his mistakes (and he made many with Eva), in his affirmation ofEva’s childhood genitality Reich was on the side of the future, whereas Annie Reich andBerta Bornstein represented the past, even if they belonged to the most enlightened wingof a dying world.Hearing Eva discuss the extent ofReich’s concern about her between 1935 and thefall of 1936, it is easy to forget that at the same time he was doing an immense amount ofwork completing his bio-electrical experiments, discovering the bions, and developing hispsychiatric therapy.In his relations with Oslo colleagues, students, and assistants, Reich was becomingvery much the leader. His Journalprovided ready publication of his own papers and those ofhis colleagues on a wide variety of subjects—his theoretical and experimental papers andclinical articles, reports by colleagues on therapy, education, and political psychology. Reichretained a generally leftist orientation and still considered himself a dialectical materialist.Indeed,he used dialectical concepts in his research, stressing the role of antithetical forces,the emergence of living substances from “material” conditions, quantitative shifts yieldingMyron SharafFury On Earth238éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"qualitative differences.Reich’s movement away from the more political aspects of Marxism was heightenedby experiences with his colleagues during these years. Difficulties emerged especially aroundthe issues of publication. Several of his young socialist assistants wanted “equal” rights indetermining the content of the JournalReich felt that since he was primarily responsible formost of the ideas and for paying publication costs, he was “more equal” than the others18.This led to charges that he was “dictatorial,” a criticism not without some justification thenand one that was to be repeated throughout his life.Reich’s closest male friendship during this period seems to have been with SigurdHoel, the novelist. In 1957 1 met Hoel and found him to be an extremely engaging, witty,reflective person, still full of warm memories if also criticisms of Reich. He liked Reich asa therapist: “He was a very good therapist with me. I saw him four times a week. The onlything that interfered was the fact that I was also seeing him socially. I saw him almost everyday for five years.”As noted, Hoel for a period served as editor of Reich’s Journalso that he met Reichas patient, friend, and co-worker. Yet Hoel felt that Reich wanted even more from him:“There was nothing of the liberal man about Reich. ... He was a tyrant. ... He wanted yourwhole life. ... He knew he couldn’t have mine—I had my writing, my loves.”19It was a mark of the two men’s intimacy that Hoel felt comfortable going unan-nounced to Reich’s apartment on the night of Hitler’s invasion of Austria in March 1938.He thought Reich should not be alone. “I never saw Reich cry, but he was close to tears thatnight. He said he had wondered if any of his friends were thinking of him,”Hoel’s reference to Reich as a “tyrant” applied especially after the start of theNorwegian newspaper campaign in late 1937. Then Elsa Lindenberg and most of his col-leagues discerned a change in him. Hoel commented that after the campaign Reich ceasedto be such a good therapist: “He began to take out his anger on his patients. He never didthat with me,but he did it with others.I saw him crush several people. That was unforgiv-able because he was the strongest one in the group.Unforgivable!”Hoel also told me the one well-documented example of Reich’s sexual indiscretionwith a patient:“Shortly after the Norwegian campaign started, Reich took on a female patient, theex-wife of a close colleague. She was a very beautiful actress. She had gone into therapy withthe explicit purpose of seducing Reich. In the beginning Reich told her that that of coursewas out of the question. But in time she succeeded. The analysis stopped, the relationshipbegan:then the relationship would stop and the analysis resume. How long this went on Idon’t know, but at some point both the relationship and the analysis ended, the relationshipat least at Reich’s instigation. The patient was furious and was determined to tell the pressabout the incident. Reich suggested that I speak to her, which I did. She poured out herhatred. I confined myself to listening and to pointing out how much she would hurt her-self—not only Reich—through newspaper stories about the affair. She finally decided not togo to the newspapers.”20239éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"When Hoel asked Reich why he had behaved thus, his reply was succinct: “A manmust do foolish things sometimes.” The last thing Reich needed at the time was a well-doc-umented newspaper story concerning his seduction of a patient.Such sexual impulsiveness with a patient was one of the minor examples of hisneurotic behavior during this period when he was undoubtedly under stress. ElsaLindenberg told me that after Reich’s discovery of the bions, and especially after the start ofthe newspaper campaign, his behavior changed. He became more suspicious, defensive, andjealous. Before the bion research, she had felt familiar with the broad outlines of his work.She could raise questions, criticize in a way that Reich found helpful. But she had no back-ground at all in natural-scientific work nor any particular disposition to learn it. Nor didReich make it easy for her to familiarize herself with his research, being so defensive that heinterpreted all questions as criticism.As the press campaign intensified, Reich withdrew socially. He and Elsa saw muchless of friends like the Hoels. They, too, found him more domineering and suspicious. Hisenemies attacked him and his friends did not understand. He felt relatively alone in his bionwork. He was especially hurt when Schjelderup, as much as anyone his original sponsor inNorway, severed Reich’s connection with the Psychological Research Institute and dissociat-ed himselffrom Reich’s experimental work.Reich’s most striking symptom during this time was his jealousy toward Elsa. Until1937, he had been supportive of her career; now he wanted her closer to him, sharing hiswork and life entirely, without other distractions. Here he was behaving like his own author-itarian father, not the champion of women’s independence he was in his writings and, forthe most part, in his life.The quarrels about Elsa’s independence reached a high point at some time during1938 when Elsa was offered the opportunity to choreograph and dance in a work jointlyplanned with a composer. Elsa accepted the assignment in the face of Reich’s intense oppo-sition.Shortly before opening night, Elsa and the composer had to meet late in the eveningat the composer’s apartment to plan some last-minute production details. They were work-ing when they heard a knock at the door. It was Reich, He entered and sat silently for a while.Then he launched into a tirade: What Elsa was doing in the theater was trivial compared towhat she might be doing with him! Suddenly he started punching the composer. Elsa con-sidered calling the police but wanted to avoid a scandal in the papers. Fortunately, Reich’srage soon subsided. The composer agreed not to speak of the incident and he kept his word,even though questions were raised when he arrived at the theater the next day with a blackeye21.Following this outburst, Elsa refused to return home with Reich but went to staywith a friend, Reich followed her there and, at first, continued his jealous accusations.Somehow or other, they finally made up and went home together. But for Elsa the relation-ship was scarred. This kind of incident made Elsa less committed to Reich. Shortly after thetumultuous evening,Reich asked her if she would emigrate to America with him. Shereplied: “No,” although she admitted: “It was the hardest 4 no’ I ever had to say.” She feltMyron SharafFury On Earth240éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"she had to get back to herself, to protect herindependence against Reich’s demands, and toconsider calmly whether she really wanted to continue their relationship.Reich’s jealousy must have been all the more painful to Elsa because he himself hadbeen having an affair quite recently with a young Norwegian textile designer named GerdBergersen. This relationship, more serious than the one with the actress-patient, came tolight in the late 1970s, when Gerd sent tapes describing her involvement with Reich to ColinWilson, who was working on The Quest for Wilhelm Reich22.In Wilson’s account, the relationship appears to have lasted several years and tohave been of considerable significance to Reich. However, in one letter to me, Gerddescribed it as lasting a “short year,” and, in another, she mentions the “very short period”she was close to Reich. She adds: “Emotionally, I do not think I got under his skin.”23Briefly, summarizing Wilson’s account, Reich and Gerd met in 1936, when she wastwenty-five, he thirty-nine. Reich was taken by her from the moment he met her, saying:“You interest me. I want to know you.” Gerd had had some disappointing experiences withmen’ and was not eager to enter a new relationship, but Reich pursued her. His interest wasnot primarily sexual he was attracted to her vibrant spirit, her quest for a creative, independ-ent life. He wanted to be a mentor to her and he succeeded, for Gerd has described theirrelationship as “perhaps the most fruitful of her life.” A well-known, older, brilliant man wastaking her seriously even when she challenged his basic views. “Reich was unoffended,”Wilson writes, “when she told him that she rejected Freud’s view that sex was the most basichuman drive.” In Gerd’s words: “He accepted me as a rational human being.”24There is no suggestion that any effort was made to conceal their relationship fromElsa even when it became a sexual one. Reich and Gerd met with Oslo intellectuals whereGerd participated eagerly in discussions.At one point Elsa became hurt and disturbed bytheir growing intimacy. She was now in the same position—that of the injured wife—toGerd as Annie had once been to her.When the Norwegian newspaper campaign erupted in 1937, Gerd saw another sideofReich. It was not the ragefui side Elsa experienced; rather, it was a “hunted and torment-ed”Reich.After some particularly bitter attack had appeared, he would go to her apartmentwith the newspaper under his arm to talk until the early hours of the morning. He spoke ofthe coming Nazi invasion of Norway, something few people in Oslo envisioned at that time.At some point during the newspaper campaign Reich half-proposed marriage and Gerdrefused him.There is some question of just how deeply involved Reich was, how much he wasspinning out a fantasy to escape from reality, a fantasy he knew she would not accept. More,he may have wanted to end the relationship by getting her to reject him. At any rate, itappears to have ended soon after Gerd’s rejection. Gerd felt relief as well as pain at the ter-mination,for she had been startled by her physical responses “The passion of the body wastaking charge, and there was something frightening about this. It was destructive.”25On Reich’s side, the relationship with Gerd is revealing in that it shows once moreone of his patterns with women. When his work was under fire, he turned to his mate for19 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1934-1939241éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"support. He felt insufficiently understood first with Annie, now with Elsa. With Annie, Liafor a while proved a more sympathetically, then Elsa. In time Elsa, too, became embroiledin his demand for total understanding and support. He turned to Gerd, seeking a “safetyvalve,” respecting her independence more because she was not so close. And, with a blindself-righteousness, he justified these affairs on the basis of his mates’ shortcomings, where-as their affairs, even flirtations, were evidence of utter perfidy.In his commotion with women, Reich may well have been displacing the rage hefelt toward his real opponents. There was no way of getting at his critics or stopping themsave through continued work. He did not want to stoop to the level of the “Kreybergs andScharffenbergs”—the level of personal mudslinging. As Use Ollendorff has well noted, hisrage was lived out against his wife, his friends, his colleagues, even his patients. The fiercerthe hostility and lack of comprehension in the press, the more he wanted envelopingwarmth, understanding, and support from those around him, and the less he felt he got it.Most colleagues could not share Reich’s awareness of the significance of the bions.They were awed by his earlier discoveries, but that was not enough for Reich. It was alwaysthe latest “child” who was most beautiful, but who was somewhat alien to his followers sincethey had been drawn to the Reich of former findings. More and more he urged them tolook,to see,to appreciate. More and more, under his pressure, with their awareness of theirscientific inadequacies and in the face of frightening criticisms from noted specialists, theypleaded: “I am ignorant, I will defend you against unfair harassment, but I cannot give youthe intellectual support, the loving criticism, the shared collaboration in further research youask of me.” And, more and more, he felt alone and misunderstood by those closest to him.Even Odd Havrevold, who of all Reich’s associates (with the possible exception ofRoger du Teil) had the clearest idea of what Reich was doing, was full of uncertainties.According to Reich, it was Havrevold who had urged him to consult the noted bacteriolo-gist, Thjotta, about the identification of certain biological forms—a step that Reich feltturned out disastrously26.Havrevold’s concerns about winning others over in support of the work—always asign,according to Reich, of inner scepticism—is better revealed in one of FenicheFs“Rundbriefe” from Prague in March 1937. Havrevold had urged an analyst visiting Oslo tolook at Reich’s work. Later, the analyst reported to Fenichel how he went to the laboratory,where Reich was very amiable, and demonstrated a lot for two and a half hours. What Isaw: particles moved in soot which glowed and floated in bouillon. I asked how one distin-guished these movements from Brownian movement. Reich replied: “It is a question of thegrowth of these forms in a culture,” and he showed me colonies. I didn’t have the factualknowledge to evaluate what I was seeing. Schjelderup ... feared that if Reich’s work under-went a scientific critique and a mistake was found which overthrew the whole thing, thatwould be a catastrophe—not only for Reich personally, but the whole of Norwegian psy-choanalysis would be compromised publicly and scientifically27.Reich could appreciate, indeed at times he shared, the attitude of Havrevold, whoMyron SharafFury On Earth242éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"sought advice from others. He could also appreciate Schjelderup’s position that he could notevaluate the bion research. Yet he felt an intense aversion to hesitation, to standing aside. AsCharles Peguy has written: “Woe to the lukewarm. Shame on him who is ashamed. Woe toand shame on him who is ashamed. The question here is not so much to believe or not tobelieve. Shame on the man who would deny his faith to avoid ridicule, to avoid beinglaughed at, to avoid being branded a fool. The question here concerns the man who doesnot trouble to find out whether he believes or does not believe.”28The enduring problem for Reich’s students remained: how to take the trouble tofind out whether they believed or did not believe; it was no small task for persons not trainedin the natural sciences.A related problem between Reich and his colleagues was that he felt he had burnedhis bridges for the sake of his work. It was he, not most of his followers, who had left thePsychoanalytic Association; he, not his followers, who bore the full brunt of the accumulat-ing newspaper campaign. He resented the fact that someone like Schjelderup could have thebest of both worlds, learning from Reich, but not endangering his secure position within thepsychoanalytic movement or academia. Reich discerned a certain small-mindedness in hissupporters’notfinding out whether or not they believed, say, in the bions. If they found hisfindings convincing,as persons of integrity they would have to defend them and be subjectto similar hostility. So there was immediate safety in ignorance. And there was historical safe-ty. If Reich were later proved correct, they could say they had always been sympathetic tohis work; if proved wrong, they had always been skeptical and scientifically unable to judge.Confronted by the opposition of his enemies, the license requirement to practicetherapy, and the uneasiness of his friends, Reich no longer found Norway a viable home forhis work. A possible solution emerged when, late in 1938, a psychiatrist came from theUnited States to study with Reich. Theodore P. Wolfe, then thirty-seven years old, had beenborn in Switzerland, and had acquired most of his medical and psychiatric training in thatcountry before moving to America. At the time he met Reich, he was a member of theDepartment ofPsychiatry at Columbia Medical School, and had done research for the pio-neering psychosomatic text Emotions and Bodily Changes,written by his former wife, H.Flanders Dunbar. Reich’s writings and his whole approach deeply impressed Wolfe, so heresolved to visit Norway, to undergo therapy with Reich, and to study his work firsthand.For Wolfe, as for many others, meeting Reich and his work represented the turningpoint in his life.As Gladys Meyer, Wolfe’s last wife, wrote in an obituary:“Real” life began for Dr. Wolfe with his work with Dr, Reich. He woulddescribe how everything he read, saw, heard, and felt changed in quality; and thevague, impatient emptiness [he had previously experienced] began, with great anx-iety to be filled up. A bond of gratefulness to Reich stemmed from that deepestcore of himself which Reich had made accessible to him. And he loved Reich, asNeill and Raknes and other old associates loved him29.243éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"In the course of his visit, Wolfe suggested that Reich move to America, where hecould find a more congenial atmosphere. Exhausted by the Oslo situation, fearing the out-break of a disastrous war in Europe, attracted to settling in America ever since 1933, Reichleaped at the idea. Furthermore, Wolfe now offered to help facilitate the move.Like others who at least in the early stages of their relationship with Reich weregrateful for the contact with their “core,” Wolfe was prepared to expend endless energy toaid Reich and to further his own association with him. On Wolfe’s return to the UnitedStates, he managed to obtain an official request from an academic institution for Reich toteach in the States, an invitation that was necessary for a residence visa. The New School forSocial Research was prepared to make such an offer, after Wolfe and Walter Briehl, anotherAmerican and an old student of Reich’s, put up several thousand dollars guaranteeingReich’s salary30. However, the immigration question was so complicated at that time withthe influx of refugees from Nazi Germany that Wolfe had to pull strings through AdolphBerle, a high official in the U.S. State Department, for Reich actually to get the visa31.Reich meanwhile was waiting impatiently in Norway. He had sent his secretary andlaboratory assistant, Gertrad Gaasland, ahead to New York in May 1939 to find a new homeand to set up the laboratory. Reich expected to follow in a matter of weeks, but the bureau-cratic entanglements entailed a longer delay.The months of waiting proved difficult. In anticipation of an early departure, Reichhad stopped his research, teaching, and therapeutic activity. He had sold his car to OlaRaknes and dismantled his apartment, staying with friends. He and Elsa still saw each otherbut she had definitely decided not to accompany him to the States then, although she didnot exclude the possibility at a later time.His letters to Gertrud Gaasland during this time reflect his mood about the visa,the difficulties of waiting, almost elegiac thoughts about his Oslo life and friends, and—most ofall—hope for the future of his work in America. The relative isolation of this timeas well as the sense ofthe “end ofa period”contribute to the unusually introspective moodofthese letters.Reich generally revealed himself more in dealing with women than withmen.Above all,there was the steady drumbeat of his work. He could not wait until thebureaucracy decided to let him live. With his talent for finding the good news in the bad, hehad the feeling that the move to America, uprooting as it was, might help the work to goforward. He also told Raknes that without his work he simply could not live. The experienceof yet another exile reinforced Reich’s sense of his heroic mission32.Not even Reich with his occasional sense of doom could have predicted the near-total break with his Norwegian colleagues that was to ensue. Only Ola Raknes, by no meansthe person closest to Reich then, would maintain an intermittent relationship. Sigurd Hoelwas never to see Reich again, claiming that he felt Reich had abandoned him. Schjelderupwould bitterly complain that Reich abused the therapeutic relationship with him. Havrevolddenounced Raknes for his close ties with Reich, a man of questionable scientific practices.For most ofthem,it was a relief to see Reich leave.Myron SharafFury On Earth244éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"In August 1939, Reich finally received his visa. On August 19, he set sail on theStavenger Fjord, the last boat to leave Norway for the States before World War II broke outon September 3. While Reich was en route to America, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germanysigned a non-aggression pact, thoroughly revealing what Reich had been saying for someyears: the revolution’s promise for the Russians had been betrayed.Elsa Lindenberg received a letter from him, written in his cabin, saying that he hadcried a good deal on the trip, that he missed her, and wanted her to join him33.19 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1934-1939245éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"20 : Getting Settled in America: 1939-1941When Reich arrived in the United States in late August 1939, Theodore Wolfe wasat the dock to meet him. Wolfe’s arduous efforts had prevailed—for Reich had just made itout of Norway.Along with Wolfe on the dockside stood Walter Briehl, the American psychiatrist.Briehl had studied with Reich in Vienna in the 1920s and in the early 1930s in Berlin. Duringthe intervening years, he had established his American practice and had enrolled for furthertraining at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. Although greatly influenced by Reich,Briehl had not followed the later Norwegian developments. When Wolfe got in touch withhim about the visa problem, Briehl had lent part of the money needed to guarantee Reich’ssalary at the New School for Social Research in New York.Watching Reich as he descended the gangplank, Briehl felt immediately that histeacher had aged considerably. He also thought Reich looked depressed. Briehl made someeffort to entertain Reich during his first days in America, taking him to a Harlem nightclubto show him something of the city, and inviting him to a relative’s farm in New Jersey for aweekend1.It was undoubtedly not easy for Reich, a proud man, to accept the hospitality ofBriehl during this lonely and difficult period. Reich found it hard to spend time with peoplewith whom he could not share his deepest concerns, and with Briehl he did not have thiskind of intimate relationship.With Lillian Bye,he did.An attractive, very intelligent Norwegian, Bye later becamean outstanding social worker in this country and in Norway. She had met Reich in Norwayand moved to the United States about the same time Reich did. They had a brief sexual rela-tionship.During the fall of1939, he told Bye not only of his intense longing for Elsa andthe unresolved problems between them, but also of his first impressions of America2.Hetold her how very beautiful it was to see Broadway, the huge neon signs that almost turnednight into day, the many cinemas and theaters. Most of his contrasts with European citiesfavored New York, with its mix of ethnic groups and races. The supple Negroes (as theywere called in those days) appealed to him, but not the many white males who impressedhim as rather rough. American women were pretty—and not his type. He liked the fact thatso many Americans were childlike and not disillusioned. On the other hand, he noted thatstrikers picketed but their protest was not linked to larger social-political concerns.Reich recognized that it would not be easy to establish himself in America; onecould get lost in the millions of people. It would be years before he could achieve the sameMyron SharafFury On Earth246éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"kind of influence in America that he had had in Scandinavia. Still, once again he found thegood news in the bad: “I will have time to work in peace.”Seen through Bye’s remarks, Reich’s early American weeks convey a kind of “mora-torium,” some respite before his work momentum was reestablished, which allowed himtime to reflect upon his past, present, and future. The first weeks in America were similar tohis experience at Davos in the winter of 1927. Once again there were scars to heal, this timefrom his Norwegian scientific upheavals and his conflicts with Elsa. He took long walks inwhat was then the countryside around Forest Hills, where shortly after his arrival, with thehelp of Wolfe and the trusty Gertrud Gaasland, he rented a house on Kessel Street. Oncesettled in, Reich would be able to pursue his myriad activities within one setting.Ilse Ollendorff has described the house:It had a small basement which was used for animal experiments, and alarge room on the first floor which served mainly as Reich’s office but also had tofunction as dining room, living room and as accommodation for the seminar [withhis American students] every other week. The regular dining room adjoining thekitchen was made into a laboratory with microscopes, oscillograph, electroscopes,and other instruments.The maid’s room on the other side of the kitchen was usedboth as office and as preparation room for the laboratory cultures and media. Thetwo bedrooms on the top floor were shared by Gertrud and the maid, and of thethree small rooms on the second floor one was used as Reich’s bedroom and theothers for psychotherapy3.The setup of Reich’s home reflected his increasing commitment to laboratoryexperimental work. His natural-scientific research, begun in Norway, was to shape the basicdesign of his life in America. It also shaped his new relationship with Ilse Ollendorff. In thebeginning of October that year, Reich met Ilse through their mutual friend, GertrudGaasland.In Germany in the early 1930s Ilse had been involved in the small SocialistWorkers Party; then she had emigrated to Paris, where she met Gertrud and Gertrud’s loverofthat time,Willi Brandt.* All three were members of the leftist party in exile4.When Gertrud and Ilse renewed their friendship in the United States, their com-mon interest soon became Reich and his work. Gertrud in her enthusiasm about both urgedIlse to meet Reich. In Ilse’s words: “I met Reich briefly and was very impressed by him, evena bit awed. He was a striking figure with his grey hair, ruddy complexion, and white coat.”5At the time oftheir meeting, Ilse was divorced and not deeply involved with any20 : Getting Settled in America: 1939-1941247éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Brandt,whose major residence after Hitler’s coming to power was in Norway, had some contact with Reich inthe late 1930s, when he was a volunteer subject in one of Reich’s bio-electrical experiments. From Spain, Brandtwrote Reich a letter about the political situation, including some comments regarding the poor status of women inthe Loyalist Army, but their relationship was never a close one, personally or intellectually. Shortly before Reich leftNorway, he wrote Gertrud that he had recently seen Brandt. The two men had good contact. However, Reich feltthat Brandt did not grasp the biological essence of his work."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"man. In France she had held a position of considerable responsibility, working with a Jewishorganization helping refugees. However, in America the clerical work she was doing boredher. Clearly, she was ripe for a major experience, personal or professional. Reich, too, wasneedy. In a historical account written some years later, Reich described the state of affairswhen Ilse appeared on the scene—the tremendous amount of work that needed attention6.Ilse soon began her fourteen-year involvement in “attending” to that “tremendousamount of work.” In December 1939, he asked her if she would be interested in workingfor him, since Gertrud could no longer handle everything herself. The original plan was forIlse to take over the secretarial and bookkeeping tasks, while she learned laboratory tech-niques from Gertrud.When Reich first met Ilse, he told her of his strong attachment to Elsa but claimedthe relationship was over. As we shall see, this description was far from complete. However,Ilse had the great advantage of proximity. She was also extremely hardworking, intelligent,and resourceful. She was open to new ideas and a person of broad culture. An attractive,youthful woman, twenty-nine to Reich’s forty-two at the time they met, Reich was undoubt-edly drawn to her sexually. On Christmas Day, they started living together in Forest Hills,though they were not legally married until 1946. Ilse began working for him on January 2,1940.In one way, Reich was relieved to be with someone less passionate and emotionalthan Elsa. Joyous as that relationship had often been, it had also taxed Reich. Elsa hadrefused to stay in place. Elsa (like Annie before her) had not only a career but a vocationapart from Reich; neither Annie nor Elsa was willing to make Reich’s work the center oftheir professional lives. Ilse was. Moreover, Ilse was the only woman of Reich’s not at allinterested in therapy—either practicing or receiving it. Annie was an analyst and Elsa under-went psychotherapy several times, and, reflecting Reich’s influence, became a dance thera-pist who utilized many concepts pertaining to body armor. By the time Reich came toAmerica, therapy was less than ever at the center of his professional concern. Biology,physics,and education were what preoccupied him now. In Ilse he had found a woman whowould mold herselfto help him to the utmost in fulfilling his daily scientific routine.Whether it was setting up appointments with patients, preparing biological experiments,keeping the books,or carrying out household tasks in an efficient, economical way, Ilse didit all and did it well.With a mate in place by Christmas, Reich also had his chief co-worker at his sidefrom the first few weeks. Theodore Wolfe knew English and German well, was a clear writerand translator, and, in addition, had a remarkable aptitude for editing and publishing. In theearly years, he was full of enthusiasm for the work. He was able to follow Reich in his cur-rent research on orgone energy, unlike others who had joined Reich at an earlier phase.Moreover, he felt enormously grateful to Reich for his therapeutic help.How much therapy Wolfe had with Reich once he was in the United States is uncer-tain, but Wolfe would undoubtedly see him for sessions when difficulties arose7. Reichoften had this kind oftherapeutic relationship with American trainees: a period of intenseMyron SharafFury On Earth248éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"work, averaging around a year and a half, then more sporadic sessions as need dictated.However, when Reich had a close working relationship with someone—especially as close,extensive, and intensive a one as he had with Wolfe—he preferred to see the person, literal-ly and figuratively, as a co-worker rather than patient as soon as possible. The period ofintensive therapeutic work was often shortened.Wolfe worked like a demon. His advice to Reich on all kinds of matters was alwaysfrank and incisive; his attitude was as uncompromising as his mentor’s. But he was not afraidto disagree with Reich, as were so many of Reich’s students. All the people closest to himduring this period—Wolfe, Ilse, and A. S. Neill (through correspondence)—spoke theirminds. These were not yes-men or -women.A third essential ingredient for Reich in establishing his new life was to form a cir-cle of people around him. He needed patients, he needed assistants, he needed a responsefrom the world. One resource was his course at the New School for Social Research, whichwas entitled “Biological Aspects of Character Formation” and given in the spring of 1940and again in the spring of 1941. Of the several dozen persons who attended, about eight toten pursued a more serious interest in Reich’s work, seeking therapy with him and attendinga biweekly seminar in his home. Among them was Alexander Lowen, at that time a teacher.By 1944,he was practicing Reichian therapy with young people and would be very active inthe totality of Reich’s work.* More pertinent to establishing himself was Reich’s need to provide the Americanpublic with access to his publications. Here Wolfe as translator, editor, and publishing advis-er was crucial. Reich and Wolfe made the decision not to translate one of the earlier worksfor the initial American publication. Each of his earlier major books—Character Analysis,TheMass Psychology of Fascism,The Sexual Revolution,The Bion—dealt with one or another aspect ofhis work, but none showed clearly the development of his thought or the interlacing of thedifferent facets. In addition, all of these books were fast becoming out of date in one wayor another,lagging behind the surge of his current work.Reich solved this problem by writing a new book and giving it an old title,TheFunction ofthe Orgasm8.The choice of title reflected his commitment to that function, or towhat he called the “red thread” running through his protean labors. It was also confusingbecause in 1927 he had published a quite different book with the same title. But Reich rarelycared about such confusions. As he once put it: “We don’t write forpeople, we write aboutthings.”9Ifthe same title fitted a new work as well as an old one better than any other title,then use it and let the public wend its way through any subsequent confusion! There was a further source of confusion. Reich mixed a provocative but clear titlewith an unclear one. On the title page,The Function of the Orgasmis listed as Volume I of aseries named The Discovery of the Orgone. Nothing about this new term had been previously20 : Getting Settled in America: 1939-1941249éditionsles atomes de l’âme*In1948,partly due to Reich’s insistence that practitioners of his therapy be MDs, Lowen went to medical schoolin Switzerland.

Nomatter. If “the function of the orgasm” was the retroactive red thread running through hiswork,“orgone energy” was a prospective red thread, as we shall discover. What was new wasReich’s conviction that he now was able to study this energy practically and to measure itinside and outside the organism.These qualifications aside,The Function of the Orgasmis not a difficult book and itdoes keep the reader in mind. Stylistically, Reich was in a felicitous phase. He had brokenaway from his earlier, more academic, Germanic style without getting into the angry out-bursts that disfigure some of his later publications. The book presents a fine mixture of per-sonal and scientific work, beginning with Reich’s medical school days and his interests ofthat time; it follows him through the early devoted discipleship to Freud, the developmentof character analysis, the controversies with Freud and the other analysts over orgasticpotency, and his sex-political endeavors (he downplayed here his earlier commitment tocommunism). It finishes with his bio-electrical experiments, the development of vegetother-apy, and a few preliminary remarks about orgone energy.According to one source, the original German manuscript contained material aboutReich’s early life, including the childhood tragedy involving his mother and tutor. However,Wolfe persuaded him that so autobiographical a section would not be appropriate for Reich’sfirst American publication10. Perhaps Wolfe was right in his advice, but for biographers thedecision was unfortunate.Reich wrote most ofThe Function of the Orgasmin 1940, in his native German. It isremarkable that he could have written so clear, well-organized, and comprehensive a workunder the many stresses of his first year in America. Extremely disciplined about writing,Reich would work a few hours on writing every day save Sunday. (He practiced—and urgedothers to follow—the policy of taking one day a week completely off from work.) SigurdHoel once ruefully compared himself to Reich: “He was very disciplined, he wrote every day.I took the days as they came”.11The book was revised, translated into English, and sent to the printer in 1941. Itappeared early in 1942.To publish it, Reich and Wolfe had to set up their own publishinghouse, the Orgone Institute Press, for no existing publishing house would have accepted TheFunction of the Orgasmin those days.As director of the Press, Wolfe with an assistant supervised all technical aspects ofpublication and distribution. A meticulous man, Wolfe took considerable pride in the excel-lence ofhis work—not only the translations themselves but the format of the publications.Around the time The Functionwas published, Reich and Wolfe also established a quarterlyperiodical, the International Journal for Sex-Economy and Orgone-Research, with Wolfe as editorand Reich as director of the Institute for which the Journal was the official organ. The newJournal represented a continuation of Reich’s Norwegian periodical, the Journal for PoliticalPsychology and Sex-economy.Neither the Functionnor the Journalbecame best-sellers. Sales figures from the earlyMyron SharafFury On Earth250éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"years are not available; however, we know that in 1950 about 450 copies ofThe Functionweresold and the sales had been fairly steady12. Reich and Wolfe were not disposed toward anybig promotional efforts. As Reich put it in a tribute to Wolfe, published in 1950: “We did notwish to join those one-day celebrities who make up in publicity for what they lack in deep-going search.”13Reich has said of him that Wolfe respected Reich’s way of expressing him-self and Reich respected Wolfe’s way of rendering it in English14. In fact, matters weresomewhat more complicated. In later years, Reich complained that Wolfe smoothed out the“climaxes” that Reich liked in writing15. Early in his translation work, Wolfe once bristledwhen Reich tried to control his translation style. Reich backed off and from then on madeno complaints directly to Wolfe16. It was a considerable relief to him when around 1948his command of English was sufficient for him to write in that tongue, independently oftranslators.There were few reviews ofThe Function of the Orgasmwhen it first appeared. In 1942a lukewarm, anonymous review was published in the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation17.The reviewer’s main emphasis was on Reich’s “rehashing” his disappointmentwith Freud, the irrelevance of Reich’s political work, and his neglect of the contributions ofothers to psychoanalysis.The American Journal of Psychiatrypublished a review by AbrahamMyerson, an eclectic psychiatrist of some repute. Myerson was largely caustic, focusing onReich’s tone of “absolute certainty” and his “monoideology” (i.e., orgastic potency).18Writing in Psychosomatic Medicine, Martin Grotjahn was entirely hostile. The book was “nutti-er than a fruitcake ... a surrealistic creation,” yet it aroused “the same fascinating interest withwhich an analyst listens to the strange associations of a patient.”19It was not until 1945, after The Sexual Revolutionand Character Analysishad beentranslated and published by Wolfe, that more serious critical attention began to be paid. In1946, the most laudatory and insightful review was published by Paul Goodman in DwightMacDonald’s periodical Politics, which reached a small but very influential audience20.Goodman contrasted Reich’s radical approach to political issues, combined with his depth-psychological, sex-affirmative orientation to the individual, with Erich Fromm’s reformistand sexually diluted approach. A talented anarchist writer, Marie-Louise Berneri, wrote oneof the first appreciations of Reich in England in the same year21.As well as establishing new relationships that fitted his current interests, Reich wasconcerned to deal with past relationships that might or might not be compatible with hisnew work. One such relationship was with Walter Briehl, who, interested in further thera-peutic work with Reich,had some sessions with him.Reich charged him $20 an hour, a sumto be deducted from the money Reich owed Briehl for subsidizing Reich’s teaching contract.Briehl rather resented Reich’s fee: “It was a lot of money in those days.” Nor did he findReich’s new bodily techniques especially effective22.Briehl’s wife, Marie, a psychiatrist, and her sister, Rosetta Hurwitz, a psychologist,also knew Reich from the Vienna days when he had been one of their analytic teachers.They, too, resumed contact with Reich in New York. In his usual way, Reich was eager to20 : Getting Settled in America: 1939-1941251éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"show the Briehls and Rosetta Hurwitz the new orgone energy phenomena which so engagedhis interest and enthusiasm. Walter wasn’t able to see certain things (orgone energy in thedark room); Rosetta could, which convinced Reich of her greater aliveness and Briehl of hergreater suggestibility.There was still another issue between Briehl and Reich. Briehl had urged Reich totake the examinations for his medical license in New York. As he had recently taken themhimself, he offered to help Reich study for them. Reich was indignant at Briehl’s repeatedadmonitions, believing that on the basis of his contributions to psychiatry, he should begranted the license without taking exams. According to Briehl, Reich became “paranoid” andbegan telling Briehl that he didn’t appreciate who Reich was. Hearing Briehl’s account some thirty years later, it was easy to see how Reich had felt patronized and Briehl feltrejected for his concern.Whatever the motivations on Briehl’s—side Reich’s fee, Briehl’s dissatisfaction withtherapy, Reich’s headlong plunge into research on orgone energy, or his refusal to get alicense—Briehl decided to break off treatment. After his last session, he folded up his sheet(Reich would ask patients to bring their own sheet, which was kept in a separate bag), shookhands, and said goodbye, never to see Reich again. One final issue remained, a familiar onewhen people ended their relationship with Reich: money. Briehl wanted back the differencebetween the money he had advanced Reich and the cost of his sessions. Reich suggested thatthe New School pay the difference. Eventually, Briehl received the money but only afterAlvin Johnson, then director of the New School, put pressure on Reich.None of the efforts to resume earlier relationships resulted in much better out-comes than the one with Briehl. Characteristically, Reich himself took the initiative with awoman,Edith Jacobson, the German-born psychoanalyst whom he had deeply respectedduring the Berlin years. After fighting against Hitler in the underground, she had been arrest-ed and spent two years in prison, where she became sick with diabetes and a hormonal dis-turbance that had not been successfully diagnosed. Through the efforts of the InternationalPsychoanalytic Association she was released from prison, went to Prague, and then came tothe United States in 1938.Not long after Reich arrived in the States he heard of Edith’s continuing illness,which involved some difficulty in breathing. He visited her in her New York apartment and,after a talk,said that he believed his new therapeutic techniques might help her. So withoutreally getting her permission, he tried to mobilize her respiration by pressing on her chest.Edith didn’t want his therapeutic aid.She told him it was impossible for him to helpwithout her cooperation. Feeling hurt and offended, he left, though she thanked him for hisgood intentions23.There is real poignancy to this meeting. Reich thought he had a chance to helpEdith and to show her firsthand the efficacy of his therapeutic developments. She permit-ted neither.Indeed, for all her respect for Reich’s characteranalytic and mass-psychologicalwork, Edith thought he had gone too far in his research on the bions and orgone energy.She believed that Reich’s latest scientific work was delusional and that she should say soMyron SharafFury On Earth252éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"plainly.There was another factor at work in the tension between Reich and Edith. Edithremained close to Annie Reich, who had already emigrated to the United States with the chil-dren. The continuing strain, indeed enmity, between Reich and Annie affected his relation-ship in the new country with Edith and also with his sister-in-law Ottilie.The wave of immigration from Hitler’s Europe brought yet another old friend toAmerica, Lia Laszky, Reich’s lover from medical school and Vienna years. She had remar-ried, recently emigrated, and felt somewhat stranded in the United States without a job.When she visited Reich, he was delighted to see her and “took beautiful pictures” of her.Characteristically, he was not especially interested in her European ordeals since leavingGermany in 1933, but full of enthusiasm for his own work, which he wanted to share withher24.Reich told Lia about the bions and orgone energy. He had her put her hand overthe bions and asked her what she felt. She said she felt a hot, prickling reaction—“He couldhave kissed me.” In his enthusiasm over her response, Reich said she should come and workwith him. Lia asked about her husband, but Reich replied that he would not fit in. Reich andLia’s husband had known each other slightly in Vienna but had taken a mutual dislike to eachother then.Nothing came ofthe idea ofLia’s working with Reich, but they remained onfriendly terms and, indeed, were to have one more important meeting.Reich also had some social meetings with his old medical school friends Paul andGisela Stein. Paul was now an internist in Manhattan. Once again Reich wanted to focus thecontact around his recent discoveries, but Paul did not wish to get involved in Reich’s workand withdrew from the relationship25.If Reich could not have contacts with his old European friends on the basis of hiscurrent interests, he wanted no contact at all The same “all or nothing” aspect of his char-acter arose with Gertrud Gaasland. Here the major differences between them seem to havebeen political.Even before coming to the United States,Reich was moving away from hismore doctrinaire Socialist views. Shortly before leaving Norway, he had published an articleentitled “Die Natiirliche Organisation der Arbeit” (“The Natural Organization of Work inWork Democracy”);significantly, instead of signing it, he described the author as a “labora-tory worker.”26Perhaps he did so because the paper represented a sharp break with hismore traditional Marxist views,a break he was not yet prepared to identify with publicly.This paper also contained his growing disillusionment with all political parties,indeed, with politics itself. He had become more and more committed to the notion of workdetermining interpersonal relationships. Only those who had factual knowledge about a par-ticular work process should participate in making decisions about that work. Here he wasclearly influenced by his own experiences. Sometime after his discovery of the bions, hecalled in various associates to discuss with them its implications.He was dismayed to findmany of them giving opinions and advice beyond their knowledge of what the bions wereall about.20 : Getting Settled in America: 1939-1941253éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"From a short-term viewpoint, Reich had by no means abandoned his political con-cerns. Right at the start of his American experience he expressed great admiration forFranklin Delano Roosevelt. On November 7, 1940, in his still clumsy English, he wrote A.S. Neill the day after Roosevelt’s third-term election about his great pleasure in Roosevelt’svictory. He also expressed his disgust when he encountered Socialists and Communists whodenounced Roosevelt27.Gertrud was undoubtedly one of those European Socialists who dislikedRoosevelt. According to Ilse Ollendorff, Reich’s stress on work democracy rather than polit-ical parties led to a sudden break with his assistant, following a violent discussion oneevening early in 1941. Gertrud left his employ the next day and eventually returned toNorway. It was one of the less admirable sides of Reich’s personality that he forbade Ilse tokeep in touch with her old friend. The two women did not resume their friendship until theI960s28.But the most complex relationships of all were undoubtedly with his children.Reich resumed seeing them after his arrival in New York, under strained conditions. Evarecalls Reich’s visiting her mother’s apartment in New York sometime in 1941 on the occa-sion of her (Eva’s) graduation from high school at seventeen. There was a huge quarrelbetween Reich and Annie and Thomas29.Annie permitted the children to visit their father but remained uneasy about thecontact. Ilse did everything she could to facilitate such visits and to serve as an intermediarybetween Reich and the Rubinsteins. On one occasion, Annie was reluctant about Lore’s stay-ing overnight with Reich and Ilse. Ilse was conducting the negotiations when Reich took thephone and asked bitterly: “What’s the matter—are you afraid I’ll seduce her?” to whichAnnie replied with equal bitterness:“I wouldn’t put it past you”.30(The old accusation thatReich was seductive and “hypnotizing,” especially with Eva, continued to be made by Annieand her circle.) Despite reaching out warmly to her father by letter after her arrival in New York,Eva remained highly ambivalent toward him during her highschool and college years. Shewas no longer in analysis with Bornstein but continued to be divided by the conflict betweenher parents and her internalization of Annie’s judgments concerning Reich’s sanity.Reich connected Annie’s animosity toward him with a dangerous incident thatoccurred shortly after Pearl Harbor. On December 12, 1941, Reich was picked up at hishome at 2:00 A.M. by the FBI on the grounds that he was an “enemy alien” and taken toEllis Island,where he was detained for over three weeks. Since his credentials as an anti-Naziand anti-Stalinist were impeccable, it was hard to understand why he was being held. It mayhave had something to do with his earlier Communist Party affiliations, or with his views onsexuality (a factor that gains weight in the light of J. Edgar Hoover’s obsession with that sub-ject), or his generally “subversive” ideas31.In any case, for Reich to be arrested by agents of a country he was coming toadmire and love was intolerable. As always, he preferred to blame persons who were or hadbeen close to him. In the case of the FBI arrest, he blamed Annie and her friends. His evi-Myron SharafFury On Earth254éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"dence was extremely tenuous, based as it was on some ambiguous statements made by hischildren when they were angry at him. There is no solid evidence that Annie ever took anyspecific action against Reich, or that she reported him to the FBI or any other agency. Sheand her friends had little use for him. They badmouthed him among themselves; theythought his work delusional and his influence on the children destructive. But there wasnever a question of taking retaliatory action of the kind Reich suspected.The Ellis Island arrest left other scars on Reich. His skin condition erupted. Thedoctor agreed that he needed special care and had him transferred to the hospital ward,where Ilse was permitted to visit him twice a week. Wolfe and a lawyer tried their utmost tofind out what the charge was against Reich. Wolfe went to Washington several times and thelawyer insisted on an immediate hearing, but despite all efforts the hearing did not take placeuntil December 26. Eventually, after Reich had threatened to go on a hunger strike, he wasconditionally released on January 5, I94232.In the edgy atmosphere right after Pearl Harbor, the authorities may have been con-cerned about certain books the FBI seized when they searched Reich’s home a few days afterhis arrest: Hitler’s Mein Kampf, Trotsky’s My Life, and a Russian alphabet for children Reichhad bought in 1929. At the hearing, Reich was questioned about his possession of thesebooks.Once again he had to point out that in order to understand mass behavior, one hadto study such books—to understand Hitler was not the same as supporting him.The stress of being arrested not only aroused Reich’s suspicions about who hadinstigated it but also about what went on during his absence. Here again his suspicions fellon those closest to him. During his detention on Ellis Island, he nursed the idea that Wolfeand Ilse might be having an affair.33Not much was made of this suspicion at the time, buta great deal was to be made later when his relations with both had deteriorated markedly.Once again in this early American period it is important to stress the familiar mixwhenever Reich entered a new phase ofhis life and work: the break-up of old professionaland personal relationships;the establishment of new ones; changes in both his scientific andhis social outlook. However, there was a special quality to his American reorientation. Thechange ofcontinents was accompanied by a shift in his identity comparable only to that ofthe Davos period, when he had committed himself, with or without Freud’s approval, to thestudy of the function of the orgasm.We can see the background of this shift most clearly in the way he resolved his rela-tionship with Elsa Lindenberg. During the fall of 1939, he missed her intensely. Elsa toldme he wrote once that even though a particular day had brought him a scientific success, bynight the success meant nothing compared to his anguish over her absence; he had cried likea baby. For her part, Elsa missed him acutely and saw the relationship in a far more positivelight; the time for reflection had led her to realize her contribution to their problems. Stillshe feared submergence in his work and personality—“I did not want to be just a wife.”34And,to her dismay, he kept pounding at her to reveal fully “the secret” of her affair.When Elsa finally but vaguely acknowledged that some sort of liaison had20 : Getting Settled in America: 1939-1941255éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"occurred, she added that she had been secretive because she did not want to provoke hisjealous rage, intensified by his “childhood drama.” Reich replied that precisely the oppositewas true: secrecy reawakened childhood traumas much more powerfully than an acknowl-edged affair. The latter he could “forgive.” * In December, Elsa was prepared to join Reich. But by this time Reich was verymuch involved with Ilse. He did not love Ilse as he loved Elsa, but she was there, she waskind, helpful, loyal and he had learned to love her.In Oslo, Elsa had complained about their social isolation. Now Reich saw even lessof people. He was no longer prepared to give endlessly and to receive so little in return. Healso realized that precisely those he had been closest to—Fenichel, Annie, Berta—were theones he believed had slandered him the most. He would keep apart. He told Bye he wasgoing to follow the “remarkable law”: Be distant, even a little haughty, withhold love, andthen people will respect you. One can perceive how carefully thought through was his cre-ation of the “Dr. Reich” his American students would come to know: the man who veryrarely took part in social occasions and whom no colleague, not even Neill, called by his firstname.This stern persona was accompanied by an equally strict resolve to carry out hisown work. No longer would he speak in the name of Freud and Marx. He had to conquerin himself the feeling that he was a difficult, inaccessible, guilt-ridden person. He had to behimself35. It was not easy to become one’s own man, especially when the stakes were ashigh as they were for Reich†. Reich’s deep sense of guilt played a role in his various renun-ciations of these months, culminating in the ending of his relationship with Elsa. “Elsa mustbe sacrificed!”he told Bye around this time.Ifhe punished himself, if he proved himselfworthy, he could go on to make the large assertions he believed were implicit in his work.However,early in January 1940 his assertions were less on his mind than his pain.Elsa told me that he wrote her a letter around this time that revealed his sense of personaldespair and hopelessness more fully than she had ever seen before. He no longer blamedMyron SharafFury On Earth256éditionsles atomes de l’âme*It is of course risible for Reich to speak of “forgiving” Elsa for what was at most a brief liaison when he hadhad a more enduring affair with Gerd Bergersen, an affair for which, as far as the record shows, he never sought“forgiveness.” In view of his writings against the double standard, his male chauvinist behavior brings to mind W.H.Auden’s lines from “At the Grave of Henry James”:Master of scruple and nuance,Pray for me and for all writers living or dead,Because there are many whose works Are in better taste than their lives,because there is no end To the vanity of our calling...†In their important study of adult life development, The Seasons of a Man’s Life, Daniel J.

He wanted Elsa to be happy and hebelieved that he brought knowledge to the world but not happiness. He did not believe inhis personal future but in his downfall—he would die alone like a dog. He would not expe-rience any rest or peace. He did not want Elsa to share this fate. Elsa belonged to anotherworld of which Reich had dreamed all his life—a world of peace, joy, sunshine, and com-panionship. Reich could not give her this in return. It hurt him terribly, for Elsa was amongthe very few people who understood him36.Reich worried that his social reserve and his renunciation of Elsa would hinder hiscreativity even while they protected it. They did not hurt his productiveness, but they hurthim personally, and others. During the American years his anger at the cost of his decisionwould grow, erupting in furies even more incandescent and destructive than those reportedby the Europeans. His plight has been aptly described by Nietzsche:Such lonely men need love, and friends to whom they can be as open andsincere as to themselves and in whose presence the deadening silence and hypocrisymay cease. Take their friends away and there is left an increasing peril; Heinrich vonKleist was broken by the lack of love, and the most terrible weapon against unusu-al men is to drive them into themselves; and then their issuing forth again is a ter-rible eruption.Yet there are always some demi-gods who can bear life under thesefearful conditions and can be their conquerors and if you would hear their lonelychant,listen to the music of Beethoven37.During periods with Elsa, Reich was able to unite work and love in an integrateddesign for life. For a decade after this separation he put aside hopes for his own emotionaland sexual fulfillment. At the end of 1939, Reich saw “the clever hopes expire of a low dis-honest decade/’to quote W. H. Auden, recognizing that he was alone personally as well asscientifically. Whatever his despair, he would continue to show a “life-affirming flame,” butthe flame he affirmed was no longer to be found in adults, individually or collectively. Hewould find it instead in infants and in orgone energy.Elsa herself was hurt and angered when Reich wrote to her breaking off theirromantic relationship;she fought hard to win him back.His desire to reunite would well upfrom time to time and he would invite her to come to America to “see”in person how thingswere after all the inner changes that had occurred. Then, in April 1940, Hitler invadedNorway.Though Reich was prepared to do everything he could to get Elsa a visa, thechances were now very slim. Moreover, Elsa had little heart for coming to America not asReich’s mate. She preferred to stay in Oslo, despite the suffering she faced from the Germanoccupation. She was never arrested but on several occasions had to flee to Sweden; the waryears were also a time of severe financial and emotional stress for her38.When I interviewed Elsa Lindenberg in Oslo during the late 1970s, she was seven-ty years old, strikingly attractive and vivacious. She could still show great emotion when sherecalled Reich’s jealous rages, his affairs, and above all what she believed to be his abrupt ter-20 : Getting Settled in America: 1939-1941257éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"mination of their relationship after his passionate letters during the fall of 1939. She spokeof Reich with a mixture of tenderness, passion, humor, and criticalness that revealed a deep,genuine, and unsentimental love. No other woman whom I interviewed talked about Reichwith that same kind of love—not Lia with her affectionate sarcasm, Ottilie with her markedambivalence, or Ilse with her detachment. After Reich, Elsa never had another serious rela-tionship with a man, although she was only in her early thirties when they parted.Although Elsa truly loved Reich, she did not especially love his work and could notfollow the natural-scientific research. For a few years after World War II, she taught a formof dance therapy that was much influenced by his psychiatric concepts. Today, she is arespected teacher of the Gindler method in Oslo.* Yet another irony emerges in Reich’s life. For all his efforts to get his mates toappreciate and follow his work, none did so after he and they parted, not even the womanwho understood him best and loved him most.Myron SharafFury On Earth258éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Elsa Gindler was a German woman who taught body techniques similar to the Alexander method and radicallydifferent from Reich’s."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940It is difficult to pinpoint the exact date for Reich’s formulation of orgone energy, aterm that he was first to use in publications after his arrival in America. However, a gradualflow of observations and new concepts was emerging from his research during the last sixmonths in Norway and during the first year in the United States. In a letter written fromNorway to Gertrud Gaasland on June 12, 1939, Reich referred to “orgone radiation.” This,to my knowledge, is his first mention of the term “orgone.” * In order to clarify the processof Reich’s discovery, it is necessary to review briefly his experiences with the SAPA-bions inhis last months in Norway1.As noted in Chapter 17, bions developed from heating ocean sand (what Reichtermed SAPA-bions) were much more effective in killing bacteria and at a greater distancethan other bion forms. In addition, Reich had noted certain visual phenomena observablein the dark basement room where the SAPA-bions were kept, for example, bluish light ema-nating from the walls and from various objects. However, he was unable to exclude clearlysubjective impressions with regard to the light phenomena.Soon after he was established in Forest Hills, Reich addressed himself to furtherinvestigation of the hypothesized SAPA radiation. For our analytic purposes, his research onthis energy—which, with increasing conviction, he would assert was orgone energy—will bedivided into three sections: visual observations, thermal measurements, and the electroscop-ic effect. The medical studies of orgone energy will be discussed in the next chapter.Visual Observations of Orgone EnergyReich’s next step in the study of energy radiation from the SAPA-bions was toattempt to build an apparatus that would contain the radiation.To accomplish this,a closed space had to be constructed for the radiation to pre-vent its rapid diffusion into the surrounding air. According to Reich’s observations, metalreflected the energy whereas organic material absorbed it. However, metal alone woulddeflect the energy on all sides. In order to avoid or minimize this external loss of radiation,Reich designed a boxlike apparatus that had metal walls on the inside backed with organicmaterial on the outside. He reasoned that the radiation from the cultures would be reflect-ed back by the inner metal walls; the outer deflection would be reduced by the external layer259éditionsles atomes de l’âme*The neologism is derived from the words “orgasm” and “organism.”"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"of organic material. One panel of the apparatus had an opening with a lens through whichpossible manifestations of the presumed energy could be observed by the researcher fromthe outside2.In effect, Reich had designed the essential features of what he would later call anorgone energy accumulator. Few people realize that initially this apparatus was not devisedto treat illness but to study visually the SAPA-bion radiation. Reich often began, as his crit-ics alleged, with very strongly held hypotheses, indeed so strongly held that they soundedlike proven convictions. In the present instance, his conviction concerned the existence ofa radiation from SAPA-bions and a determination to study it. But his belief that he haddevised an apparatus that would isolate the radiation soon proved wrong.When Reich began to observe through the lens the enclosed dark space containingthe SAPA-bions, at first he noted what he expected: the same kind of visual phenomena butin an even more intense form than he had previously seen. Now it was possible to distin-guish two kinds of light phenomena: bluish, moving vapors, and sharper, yellowish pointsand lines that flickered. Reich expected that when he removed the SAPA-bions and ventilat-ed the apparatus, the light phenomena would disappear. However, he found exactly the samelight phenomena, though not as strong, in the empty box,in the absence of SAPA cultures.Hefirst assumed that the organic part of the enclosure had absorbed energy radiating from thecultures, and this was what showed. Then he took the box apart, dipped the metal plates intowater, put in new cotton, and ventilated everything for several days. But when he tried oncemore, he still found some visual phenomena. He also had another box built, with a glassfront wall but without organic material outside. This box he kept carefully away from roomsin which SAPA cultures were stored. However, no matter what he did, he could not elimi-nate the radiation from the empty box. The light phenomena were not as intense as whenthe box contained cultures, but they were undoubtedly present.Confronted with the ever present visual phenomena, Reich groped to the conclu-sion that the energy he was studying was “everywhere.” In his account, he did not arrive atthis beliefeasily:During the first two years ... I doubted every one of my observations. Suchimpressions as “the energy is present everywhere” ... carried little conviction; on thecontrary they were apt to raise serious doubts. In addition, the continuous doubts,objections and negative findings on the part of physicists and bacteriologists tend-ed to make me take my observations less seriously than they deserved to be taken.My self-confidence at that time was not particularly strong. Not strong enough towithstand the impact ofall the new insights which followed from the discovery ofthe orgone3.Reich often wrote—and acted—like a person with supreme self-confidence, evenarrogance. In this instance he was struggling with a continual problem: how to trust himselfin the face of great discoveries, and not yield to self-doubts accentuated by the external crit-Myron SharafFury On Earth260éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"icism of his method and his findings. Over and over again he was haunted by the question:If what I see exists, why wasn’t it discovered before? And the corollary: Am I badly offtrack? With the problem of a seemingly ubiquitous energy in mind, Reich, with Ilse, tookhis first American vacation in the summer of 1940 a camping trip through New England.After a week in New Hampshire, their tent leaked. They then drove into Maine, to the north-west part of the state, where they rented a cabin on Mooselookmeguntic Lake, near thesmall town of Rangeley. The lake was large, the cabin simple and quiet. The air was clear anddry, not hot and humid as summer was in Forest Hills. Reich loved the region immediately.It was to have a deep significance in his life. Here he would spend longer and longer sum-mer periods, then establish his main research center, which he called Orgonon; finally, after1950, he would live year round in the area.It may have been a “vacation,” but once located on Mooselookmeguntic, Reichwasted no time in getting down to work. Again, he proceeded in his naive way. One nighthe was watching the sky above the lake. He noted stars flickering, stronger in the east thanthe west, though the moon was low on the western horizon. Reich reasoned that if the the-ory that the flickering of the stars was due to diffuse light was correct, the flickering wouldhave to be the same everywhere or even more intense near the moonlight. But exactly theopposite was the case.Just as earlier Reich had looked at the emotional expression of the body in a newfashion, so now he began to watch the sky above the lake in a manner radically differentfrom that of current observation with its panoply of instruments. In relying initially on hisown organism as his main research tool, Reich returned to the earlier investigative emphasisof Goethe: “Man himself, inasmuch as he makes use of his healthy senses, is the greatestand most exact physical apparatus; and that is just the greatest evil of modern physics thatone has, as it were, detached the experiment from man and wishes to gain knowledge ofnature merely through that which artificial instruments show.”4In Reich’s view,to have limited his study of nature only to what he could measurethrough instruments would be equivalent to having studied the emotions of man only bymeans of quantitative indices. He would have had to rule out his subjectiveimpression thatthe patient had,for example, a soft or hard or “aristocratic” character armor. However,unlike the artist or the philosopher, Reich was as interested in arriving finally at objectivedata in his study as he was in obtaining the same kind ofevidence concerning the emotion-al life of man.In Maine, Reich began to look at individual stars through a wooden tube.Accidentally,he focused the tube on a dark blue patch between the stars. To his surprise, hesaw a vivid flickering, then flashes of fine rays of light. The more he turned in the directionof the moon, the less intense these phenomena appeared. They were most pronounced inthe darkest spots of the sky, between the stars. It was the same flickering and flashing he hadobserved so many times in his box.A magnifying glass used as an eyepiece in the tube mag-nified the rays. All of a sudden, Reich’s box with its flickering lost its mysterious quality. The21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940261éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"explanation was simple: the energy in the box, in the absence of cultures, came from theatmosphere. Hence the atmosphere contained an unknown energy.Reich went on to make a series of visual observations of this energy, includingmagnifying the phenomena in order to rule out the possibility of their being only subjectivesensations. However, these efforts were never decisive in the sense of permitting a criticaltest. David Boadella has summed up this controversial subject succinctly:If such phenomena as Reich described in the sky in fact exist, why is it,one may reasonably ask, that other people have not commented on them? Let usconsider a related phenomenon that can be observed in the daytime, which Reichalso described. If one looks into the daytime sky on a clear day, relaxes the eyes, andlooks into empty space, a number of brilliant points of light become visible. Theyappear to dance about in whirling motions.Anyone who looks at the sky in this way can observe these points of light,yet few people are in fact aware of them until their attention is specifically direct-ed. One does not find in the annals of science a description of these points of lightWhether they are phenomena associated with the human eye (endoptic) or phe-nomena that are properties ofthe atmosphere (exoptic) as Reich believed, one willfind an account of them neither in textbooks of vision, nor in textbooks of mete-orology or atmospherics. The phenomenon is one that was never studied becausescientists did not give up valuable time to looking at darkness, or into empty boxes,or at a blue sky5.It is characteristic of Reich’s method that in reporting his path to orgone energy, heinterrupted the account of various experiments to deal more broadly with “subjectiveimpressions of light.” He recalled children’s fascination in closing their eyes and playinggames with afterimages. Reich was doing something interesting in this little exegesis. Thevery process ofturning away from inner childhood sensations, including the delight in “see-ing things with our eyes closed,” contributed to the adult fear of direct observation. Reichalways kept central his awareness of how much our attitudes toward our own sensationscould affect reactions to his “orgonomic”* findings—from orgastic potency to the bions toorgone energy in the atmosphere. Afraid of the energy within us, we cannot see the sameenergy outside ourselves. As Goethe put it in a favorite quote of Reich’s: “Is it then so greata secret, what God and mankind and the world are? No! But none like to hear it, so it restsconcealed.”Initially,Reich was puzzled by the nature of the bion radiation, then further per-plexed by his inability to isolate the radiation. We leave him in the summer of 1940 findingvictory in his failure: he could not isolate the radiation because it was “everywhere.”Myron SharafFury On Earth262éditionsles atomes de l’âme*All phenomena pertaining to the spontaneous movement of orgone energy Reich came to subsume under thename he gave his science, orgonomy."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"As far as Reich’s formulation of orgone energy was concerned, in one sense he hadbeen working with it throughout his long focus on bodily energy. He was certainly workingon it more concretely in the bio-electrical experiments, the spontaneous motility of thebions, and the radiation from the SAP A cultures. But he himself dated the discovery to hisvisual observations over a lake in Maine.The observations at Mooselookmeguntic Lake represent a moment of epiphany forReich. For the first time he allowed himself fully to believe that he was observing a radia-tion apart from the SAPA cultures, and, although he could not prove it, distinct from sub-jective light phenomena. It was not until he felt he was dealing with an energy outside thebody, outside matter itself, that he could break away from more conventional terminology—libido, bioelectricity—for the energy within the body, and refer to his discovery as “orgoneenergy.”Over and beyond that, the Mooselookmeguntic experience represented thesharpest possible contrast with the science of Reich’s day. Just ten months earlier, onOctober 11, 1939, President Roosevelt had received Einstein’s letter urging the developmentof an atomic bomb in the face of Hitler’s likely push toward the same goal. That letter wasto inaugurate the Los Alamos project. Meantime, Reich was making his lonely foray with themost primitive equipment and “foolish”observations in dark basements and over a lake. Hewas often to contrast the technical magnificence devoted to the “death rays” with the sim-ple unsupported efforts that led to the discovery of the “life rays.”The contrast should not obscure the similarities between Reich’s approach and thatof traditional science, however. Reich yielded to no scientist in his concern for objectivemeasurement. Although his visual observations had not led to any “crucial experiment,” hewas soon to turn to verifiable hypotheses and replicable experiments.Thermal Measurements of Orgone EnergyThe device Reich had constructed to observe visual phenomena from SAPAbionsbecame the orgone energy accumulator. In other words, the apparatus for enclosing the radi-ation from the bions also attracted (and accumulated) the energy he saw “everywhere.” Hisreasons for this were several. For one thing, the visual phenomena of orgone energy werestronger within this kind of enclosure, in the absence of SAPA cultures, than they were inthe free air or in a simple Faraday cage (an enclosure with walls of copper wire mesh toblock electromagnetic radiation). For another, Reich noted a sensation of heat or a fineprickling, if the hand or skin surface was held at a short distance (about four inches) fromthe walls ofthe accumulator.These subjective sensations were the same as he had experi-enced when working with the SAPA-bions.Reich’s scientific explanation for the capacity of his apparatus to concentrateorgone energy from the atmosphere was as follows:Organic material attracts and absorbs orgone energy. When our hair or a nylon slipor a rug crackles with “static electricity,” this is a similar phenomenon. Such crackling is like-21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940263éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"ly to occur more vigorously on a dry, clear day than on a humid one. For Reich, static elec-tricity was one manifestation of orgone energy.Metallic material also attracts orgone energy but repels it again rapidly. The metalradiates energy to the outside into the organic material and to the inside into the space ofthe accumulator. The movement of energy inward is free, while toward the outside it isbeing stopped. Thus, it can oscillate freely on the inside, but not to the outside. In addition,part of the energy radiated outward is absorbed by the organic material and given back tothe metal.Reich cited an unexplained aspect about the accumulator: “In which manner theenergy penetrates the metal we do not know. All we know is that it doespenetrate it, for thesubjective and objective phenomena are far more intensive within the apparatus than on theoutside.”6Here Reich was stating a genuine puzzle. But the admission was seized upon by hiscritics to ridicule him. Reich said he didn’t know how the energy penetrates the metal, butsomehow it did; the critics acted as if the admission itself removed his work from seriousconsideration. Whatever his uncertainties, Reich then proceeded toward more objective cri-teria. He designed a small accumulator so that the scale of a decimal thermometer, onceinserted,could be read through a glass-covered aperture. An identical thermometer was sus-pended at the same height outside to measure the room temperature. Reich found a constanttemperature difference between the two thermometers, ranging between o.2°C and 1.8°Cwith a mean of 0.5°C. The accumulator was constantly warmer than the surrounding air. Asa control, Reich repeated the experiment, but this time using a box of the same size built ofwood or cardboard only. The temperature in both the room and in the wooden box equal-ized quickly. A temperature difference appeared only when the box was lined with metal onthe inside.During 1940 and 1941, Reich made observations of the temperature difference inthe accumulator and outside it—a difference that he labeled “To-T.” The “To” stood for thetemperature inside the accumulator,with “T” representing the temperature in the controlbox.On many days he measured the temperatures every two hours. In addition to indoormeasurements he also measured To-T outdoors, both above ground and with boxes buriedin the soil.The differences were more marked outdoors than indoors, and stronger in good,clear weather. During rainy weather, the temperature differences were minimal or altogeth-er absent.Reich also noted that visual observations of orgone energy were stronger in goodweather than in humid or rainy weather7.I shall postpone a more detailed critique ofthese temperature findings until later.But Reich believed he had taken an enormous step forward. He had gone beyond the trou-blesome issue of “subjective light” phenomena that had complicated the visual observa-tions. Moreover, he had found an experimental setup that did not depend on the “vegeta-tive liveliness” of the experimenter, for the recordings were entirely objective. Indeed, withmodern equipment,the measurements could be made without a human observer. Thehypothesis of a higher temperature in the accumulator could be readily replicated all overMyron SharafFury On Earth264éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"the world.The Orgone Accumulator and the Electroscopic EffectIn the growing fervor of his conviction that he was on the track of a universal ener-gy, Reich began to measure orgone energy by means of an electroscope about the same timeas he was recording To-T.The electroscope itself consisted of a vertical metal pole to which a fine gold oraluminum leaf was attached, the whole being enclosed in a glass and metal case. When asource of voltage or electrostatic charge (e.g., from rubbing one’s hair with a comb) wasbrought near to, or into contact with, the metal pole, a movement of the leaf away from thepole could be observed; this represented a “deflection” of the leaf measured in degrees ofangle. This device has been used since the eighteenth century to measure voltage and mon-itor “atmospheric electricity.8Several factors influence the rate of fall or discharge of the deflected leaf.According to electrostatic theory, essentially it discharges because of humidity in the air,since moisture acts as a conductor. Also, other things being equal, the greater the radiationfrom such sources as X-rays, ultraviolet rays, cosmic rays, the faster the discharge. Thus, elec-troscopes discharge more rapidly at higher altitudes due, presumably, to the stronger effectof cosmic rays.Reich reasoned that since other manifestations of orgone energy, such as the tem-perature difference and the visual phenomena, were stronger in less humid or more orgonot-ically charged weather, the electroscope should discharge more slowly in an accumulatorthan in free air. (Whereas classical electrostatic theory had no problem in explaining a morerapid discharge of the electroscopic leaf in humid or rainy weather, it would not predict anydifference in discharge rate within the kind of box Reich termed an accumulator.) Reich’s experiments confirmed in fact that the speed of discharge was slower onthe inside ofthe accumulator than on the outside.On the average, the electroscope dis-charged twice as slowly in the accumulator as in the free air. The difference between theinside rate and outside was less in humid and rainy weather, just as the visual phenomenaand To-T were less marked during those periods9.As a control against the objection that the difference might be due to better air cir-culation outside the electroscope, Reich introduced a fan into the accumulator to circulatethe enclosed air. This had no effect on the rate of natural leak.The electroscopic findings combined with the temperature difference gave Reichincreased confidence about the objective significance of his research on orgone energy.Initially, heat and a fine prickling were felt in the accumulator. The thermometer registereda higher temperature in the accumulator than outside it or in a control box. The electroscopehad a slower rate of discharge inside the accumulator. Moreover, all of these differenceswere more pronounced on drier days than on humid ones. Subjectively, as Reich said, we alsofeel better with low humidity, when there is more “orgone energy” in the atmosphere.21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940265éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Given the potential significance of these findings, why did Reich not immediatelyseek confirmation from the scientific community? In his own way Reich did just that. First,as noted, Wolfe and he were making every effort to publish a journal with the results ofReich’s experimental work. Second, and more immediately, on December 30, 1940, he wroteto Albert Einstein, requesting a meeting to discuss orgone energy research10. On January13, 1941, a five-hour meeting between Reich and Einstein took place in Princeton, NewJersey11.It was highly characteristic of Reich to go right to the top of the scientific commu-nity. As a young analyst he had wanted to deal directly with Freud as much as possible ratherthan Freud’s lieutenants. Later, as we shall see, when he believed his work had great signifi-cance for national public policy, he tried to deal directly with the White House and theAtomic Energy Commission.Why exactly did Reich seek a meeting with Einstein? After his experiences with theNorwegian scientific authorities, Reich was determined not to turn again to presumedexperts for support or validation of his work. He would quietly publish his findings and letthe world react as it would. Yet when A. S. Neill sent Reich’s books and journals during the1940s to people like H. G. Wells, Reich was at first appreciative. Then, when Wells and oth-ers dismissed the work as rubbish, Reich became angry at Neill’s seeking approval fromupholders of established modes of thought. As Reich once commented, Neill would havebeen indignant if his books on Summerhill were sent to the New York Department ofEducation for approval.Now Reich was turning to Einstein. As we have seen, Reich felt armed with theimportant objective evidence of the discovery of the temperature differential and the slow-er electroscopic discharge. Certain positive medical effects of the accumulator (to be dis-cussed in detail later) also made him hope that his work in general, and the accumulator inparticular,might play an important part in the war effort.Although he was quite aware of the revolutionary quality of his work and the con-sequent need to proceed slowly (or organically, as he would say), he continued paradoxical-ly to think that his work could be rapidly accepted in times of social crises. This led him tohope that the crisis of World War II, with America’s involvement imminent, might providethe stimulus, the emergency, to propel his work to its rightful place. In addition, Einsteinmight help supply the badly needed resources he lacked to push a concerted effort onorgone research.But probably the most important reason for going to Einstein was Reich’s profes-sional loneliness. In a letter to Neill around this period, he wrote that only Wolfe and Ilseunderstood what he was doing. Here he was being optimistic. Wolfe did not work in the lab-oratory, despite considerable pressure to do so. Ilse participated in laboratory work; withextraordinary conscientiousness, she shared an existence, as she later described it, dominat-ed by the stopwatch measuring the electroscopic discharge rate. However, she lacked the sci-entific training to understand truly the nature of Reich’s investigations. A. S. Neill, the per-Myron SharafFury On Earth266éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"son with whom Reich corresponded most during the early forties, was very supportive ofReich’s educational and psychiatric work but took the position that he knew nothing of sci-ence and hence had no opinion on “orgones” (as he and others were wont to call orgoneenergy, to Reich’s considerable irritation). It took Reich quite a while to persuade Neill tobuild and use an accumulator. Thus Reich had a strong desire for scientific “company.”Finally, there was Reich’s personal need for Einstein’s understanding and support.Since his break with Freud, Reich had not had a close relationship with an older man whocould be a source of strength and guidance. We know how difficult that rupture was. It wasnot until 1946 that Reich told Raknes he was at last free of his dependency on Freud.Reich had been defying authorities for some time—Freud, the Marxists, the elec-trophysiologists, the bacteriologists, and now the physicists. This willingness to see things forhimself, not to take the authorities’ word for it, had some roots in his early familial conflicts.He had disliked his father’s authoritarianism and he had also seen that the “old man” wasnot so powerful or right as he seemed to be. He—and other supposed “last words”—couldbe defeated where it counted, for all their seeming strength, power, even arrogance. Thetruth was not necessarily as it was perceived.In spite of his other responsibilities, Einstein must have been intrigued by the briefdescription Reich gave in his letter, for a few days later he replied, asking Reich to arrangean appointment.Ilse OllendorfF has described Reich’s mood:Reich was very excited and had his approach to Einstein carefully preparedwhen he left for Princeton on January 13 around noontime. He returned very latethat evening, close to midnight. I had waited up for him, and he was so full ofexcitement and impressions that we talked far into the early morning hours. He toldme that the conversation with Einstein had been extremely friendly and cordial, thatEinstein was easy to talk to,that their conversation lasted almost five hours.Einstein was willing to investigate the phenomena that Reich had described to him,and a special little accumulator had to be built and taken to him....Reich spoke ofhow exciting it was to talk to someone who knew the background of these physi-cal phenomena,who had an immediate grasp ofthe implications. He started to day-dream ofpossibilities for working with Einstein at the Institute for AdvancedStudies, where he would be in a community of scientists on a level where he, Reich,would not always be the giving one, with everybody else taking, as it was in his ownInstitute, but where he could find a give and take on his own level. He had wantedfor a long time to be done with the world ofthe neurotic, to devote himself sole-ly to the biophysical aspects of the discovery He spoke that night of such possibil-ities, and hung onto this daydream for the next few weeks12.In his own account,Reich stuck to the factual and scientific issues. In a conversa-tion that began at 3:30 and ended at 8:30 in the evening, he explained to Einstein about the21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940267éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"bionous disintegration of matter, the discovery of orgone energy in the SAPA-bions andthen in the atmosphere. Einstein became increasingly interested and excited. Reich hadbrought with him a device through which the flickering phenomena could be observed and,in a darkened room, they made their observations. Einstein was amazed at what he saw, butthen queried: “But I see the flickering all the time. Could it not be subjective?”13Reich then moved on to measurable findings. He told Einstein about the tempera-ture difference in the accumulator. Einstein replied that that was impossible, but if true itwould be a “great bombshell.”14He also promised to support Reich’s discovery if the find-ings were verified. Before leaving, Reich suggested that Einstein could now understand therumor that he was insane. Einstein replied that he certainly could.Reich built a small accumulator, which he took to Einstein about two weeks later.The accumulator was put on a small table with a thermometer above it and another suspend-ed a few feet away. Together, the two scientists observed that the temperature above theaccumulator was about one degree warmer than the temperature away from the accumula-tor. Einstein wanted to observe the phenomenon over a period of time.Subsequently, he wrote Reich that he had limited his efforts to the temperature dif-ference because of his inability to exclude subjective impressions regarding the light mani-festations of orgone energy. Initially, he found the accumulator temperature regularly high-er than that registered at the second thermometer. However, an assistant had offered theexplanation that this difference was due to convection currents between the air over thetable and the air of the room as a whole.Einstein then took the trouble to note a temperature difference of 0.68°C betweenthe air above the table top (with the accumulator removed) and the air below, due to warmair convection from the ceiling and cooler air currents below the table. He suggested thatthis process was entirely sufficient to explain the temperature difference that Reich hadobserved and that Einstein had confirmed15.Reich reacted strongly to Einstein’s letter16.First,he outlined several experimentswhich he had conducted to control the interpretation of Einstein’s assistant. Most decisive-ly,he stressed that the temperature difference was even stronger out of doors, removing theissue of “convection currents” from the ceiling.In his twenty-five-page response to Einstein, Reich did much more than describehis further experiments. He also expressed a deep concern, a poignant anxiety, that Einsteinmight withdraw from the whole affair. “Convection currents from the ceiling” would nowjoin “air germs”and “Brownian movement” as convenient explanations for new findings,without the critics’ having to take pains to deal with Reich’s answers to these explanations.The new findings could be neatly categorized. To Einstein’s credit, he thought seriously fora while and he experimented. But once satisfied with his own explanation, he believed thematter “completely solved,” and showed no wish to pursue Reich’s further experiments.In an effort to enlist Einstein’s sympathy, Reich made common cause with him—for the first time, to my knowledge. His letter noted that it was Einstein’s concepts about therelation ofenergy to matter that had led Reich to “smash matter” through heat and soak-Myron SharafFury On Earth268éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"ing, thereby releasing bionous particles. He tried to convince Einstein of the urgency of hisdiscoveries, which could help in the treatment of cancer and with the victims of war.Working alone, it would take Reich decades; with Einstein’s support, a major breakthroughcould occur much sooner to the benefit of mankind. He could understand if Einstein, pre-occupied with other matters, did not wish to invest time and energy in Reich’s work. Butthere was the added danger that word might get around that Einstein had “controlled”Reich’s work and come up with a negative conclusion. The world, scientific and lay, wouldaccept that as the final judgment. Reich still was very grateful to Einstein for taking the painsthat he had, no matter what his future decisions.Reich’s near-desperate efforts to keep Einstein’s support—his anxiety that Einsteinwould withdraw, or worse, that his negative interpretation would irreparably damage Reich’swork in the eyes of the world—all remind us of similar feelings when Freud refused to sup-port Reich’s orgasm theory long before. Freud’s course of support and rejection hadspanned fourteen years, Einstein’s a matter of months. Once again, Reich had turned to anolder man whose work had stimulated him, both as a student and teacher, turned with theidea of “continuing” Einstein’s work on energy and matter.Not exactly bashful, Reich now pressed Einstein as he had pressed Freud. If farmore had been at stake personally with Freud, far more was at stake scientifically withEinstein. It was a question of basic laws of nature, of a concrete energy concentrated in asimple device that had healing potential. Reich was prepared to appear “pushy,” for, in oneof his favorite phrases, “we are not playing for peanuts.” There was nothing apologetic inhis stance toward Einstein; Einstein shouldfollow through on his initial enthusiasm, at leastto the extent of replicating Reich’s additional experiments. Although he left Einstein theexcuse of pleading other preoccupations, Reich was determined that the famed scientist notbe quoted as “refuting” Reich’s work. For Einstein had everything in terms of credibility inthe scientific and popular community, while Reich had next to nothing.Einstein never answered Reich’s long letter or the several subsequent ones. Whenrumors began to circulate about Einstein’s refuting Reich’s work, Wolfe wrote Einsteindirectly,saying that it would be necessary to publish the full correspondence between thetwo scientists in order to set Einstein’s “negative finding” in proper context17. Einsteinresponded angrily about having his name used for advertising purposes18.Reich in turnreacted angrily,citing the damage done by incomplete stories about the encounter19.Einstein replied that he had not been the source of these stories, that he had treated withdiscretion their written and oral communications, and that he hoped Reich would do thesame20.Reich’s final reply, never mailed, stated that he had requested Wolfe not to publishanything on the subject21. He was still puzzled by Einstein’s silence in response to his ownlong letter about the additional experiments. Then Reich used a characteristic defense afterdisappointment. He maintained that he himself had no interest in official confirmation ofhis findings, but many of his colleagues wanted to have the discovery of orgone energy gen-erally accepted. It was they who were pressing for publication22.21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940269éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"The correspondence was published, but only in 1953 when Reich and his workwere in great peril. * I have described the encounter with Einstein from Reich’s viewpoint only. We donot have Einstein’s version. His sympathetic biographer, Ronald W. Clark, has written offthe matter as quite insignificant. In a few amused paragraphs, he describes how Einstein,“the most amiable of men,” kindly granted that “eccentric” figure Reich an audience, suc-cumbing to “the bait” of Reich’s suggestion that orgone energy might be useful in the fightagainst the Nazis. Einstein later found a “commonplace explanation” of the phenomenaReich had shown him. That was that23.Clark’s tone is remarkably similar to the one employed by Ernest Jones in his offi-cial description of the Reich-Freud conflict. In both instances, the Reich “affair” was treat-ed as quite inconsequential in the careers of two great men.There have been about twenty positive replications of varying quality of Reich’sthermal and electroscopic findings, starting in the 1950s and continuing into the 1980s. Thebest-controlled replication of the temperature difference was conducted by Dr. CourtneyBaker, son and student of Elsworth F. Baker, the man Reich subsequently placed in chargeoftraining orgonomic psychiatrists, as we shall see later.Courtney, a psychiatrist with graduate training in physics, added to Reich’s experi-mental design a very carefully constructed control box with precisely similar insulating prop-erties as the accumulator. This “balanced” control box then showed the same sensitivity tofluctuations in room temperature as did the accumulator. On the basis of 204 readings over15 days, he found a positive temperature difference 51 percent of the time, a negative tem-perature difference 25 percent of the time, and no temperature difference in 24 percent ofthe readings24. On only one occasion—just before a severe storm in 1950 had Reichobserved a negative temperature difference.Baker hypothesized that the considerable number of negative temperature differ-ences in his study was due to changes in the atmosphere, especially the effects of pollutionthat had occurred since Reich’s original work. What is significant in this context, however, isthe large number ofpositive temperature differences. Also significant is that from the van-tage point of traditional physics there should be notemperature difference, positive or neg-ative.The one available negative replication was conducted in the course of the Food andDrug Administration (FDA) investigation of the accumulator during the late 1940s and early1950s.This investigation belongs in detail to a later chapter, but one point deserves mentionhere. The FDA contracted with Dr. Kurt Lion of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyto replicate Reich’s findings. He found no positive temperature difference within the accu-Myron SharafFury On Earth270éditionsles atomes de l’âme*There is no evidence that Reich ever sought permission to publish these letters from Einstein who was stillalive in 1953, nor is there any evidence that Einstein ever commented on them. The Einstein pamphlet had, inany case, a very limited publication of about 1,000 copies."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"mulator, but he did find a number of negative temperature differences25. Although Dr.Lion did not balance the accumulator and the control box so that they fluctuated equallywith changes in room temperature, he did place the accumulator and the control in a fairlyconstant room temperature and took a great number of readings over a two-week period.However, Dr. Lion did not describe in his protocol how he achieved a fairly evenroom temperature. If this was done by air conditioning, particularly in a closed air system,it could affect the orgone energy properties of the atmosphere. * This is another exampleof the subtle problems involved in replication of orgonomic experiments. In a legitimateeffort to control an extraneous variable, such as fluctuations in room temperature, one mayobliterate the very thing under study. These issues place a responsibility on the experimenterto meet Reich’s conditions and at the same time achieve an objective test of the hypothesis.Before considering the significance of these temperature difference replications,positive and negative, let us look briefly at the control studies of the electroscopic findings.Here again the best positive replication was done by Dr. Courtney Baker. Like Reich, hefound a slower rate of discharge for the electroscope in the accumulator than in free air26.The main negative replication was contained in a brief report to the FDA by another physi-cist, Dr. Noel C. Little of Bowdoin College. His report states that “Identical quantitativemeasurements were obtained both inside and outside the accumulator... . Results were exact-ly what would have been expected.”27There is no supporting description of such factorsas atmospheric conditions in the experimental room or the weather.Dr. Lion also presented for the FDA a theoretical refutation of Reich’s electroscop-ic findings. Unlike Dr. Little, Dr. Lion believed that one would not expect identical readingson the electroscope inside and outside the accumulator. On the basis of electrostatic theo-ry,one would expect the results Reich obtained—a slower discharge in the accumulator—since metal acts as a shield against ionizing radiation in the air28.So Dr. Lion did not carryout any replication.For him,Reich’s findings were completely predictable—and banal. Thus,two reputable physicists derived from the same theory very different predictions concerningthe accumulator’s effect on the discharge rate of the electroscope.There are several further problems with the replications. First, all the positive stud-ies have been conducted by persons enthusiastic about much, if not all, of Reich’s work.Could not experimental bias have been the chief reason for the positive results? When askedto comment on this, Dr. Baker replied:It is true that I am “sympathetic” to Reich’s work in the sense that I believein its value and validity, and that it should be supported. Does this make me unre-21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940271éditionsles atomes de l’âme* In this connection, Ernest Hemingway has made an interesting comparison of several “bad” atmospheres simi-lar to Reich’s analysis: “I can be depressed by [the weather] when it is rainy, muggy, and with constant barometricchanges. ...

The implication from the state-ment “Baker wished a favorable outcome” is that my work and that of other sup-porters of Reich is biased and skewed. This is a subtle catch-22: those who take thetrouble to demonstrate the validity of his work become tainted as “sympathetic”and thus excluded. ... I would have been personally happier had [Reich’s] pendulumexperiment come out exactly as Reich states, but it did not and that is what I report-ed29.The negative replications of Drs. Lion and Little contain the possibility of a reversebias. The FDA chose both men as expert scientists in part because they indicated an eager-ness to be helpful in what they thought was a worthwhile effort to stop an obvious fraud.This kind of attitude does not suggest “objectivity” any more than the enthusiasm of thepositive replicators.A second, more important point concerns the paucity of these replications. It isnow over forty years since Reich asserted a temperature difference in the accumulator. Whyhas so little been done when so much is at stake? And, especially, why has so little been doneby highly qualified scientists? These questions presuppose a disinterested scientific community that will lookcalmly at any new concept or finding, if it has even a remote possibility of adding to ourknowledge. However, as the scientific historian Thomas Kuhn brilliantly argues, upholdersof an established conceptual scheme (or “paradigm,” in his language) are not likely to bekindly disposed toward any new paradigm or “revolutionary science.”30This resistance isnot due simply to prejudice or pigheadedness, though both may be factors in any giveninstance. Representatives of a particular scientific discipline may accomplish a great deal bypursuing an agreed-upon paradigm and applying it to an increasing number of problems—in short, to pursuing “normal science.” Scientists are reluctant to abandon their establishedconcepts unless through their investigations they uncover such significant “anomalies” ordivergent findings as to constitute a “crisis” in the field. “The reason is clear,” Kuhn states.“As in manufacture, so in science—retooling is an extravagance to be reserved for the occa-sion that demands it.”31It is much easier to try to find some means of explaining new findings through theold theory or adumbrations to it.An example of using the old theory to explain orgonomyis to posit that Reich’s bions developed not from disintegrating matter but from highly heat-resistant air germs. An example of adumbration is to explain the effect of the accumulatorin terms of negative ions, obviating any need for a new orgonomic paradigm.The proponents of the new paradigm have the responsibility to advance their casewith sufficient persuasiveness to win over a young generation of scientists not yet totallyimmersed in the existing conceptual scheme. In the grim words of the renowned Germanphysicist Max Planck: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponentsand making them see the light,but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a newgeneration grows up that is familiar with it.”32Myron SharafFury On Earth272éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"In this connection it is useful to recall that it was not until a hundred years afterCopernicus’s death that there was a sizable number of supporters of the heliocentric theo-ry. One might expect that so long a delay in the acceptance of a better scientific paradigmbelongs to the past, when religious dogma ruled more powerfully than today. However, thereis an analogous example from our own century which also makes the point.In 1912, a meteorologist named Alfred Wegener suggested that the continents hadmoved. To quote John McPhee: “He was making an assertion for which his name would livein mockery for about fifty years.”33Not until the 1960s did Wegener’s original theory of“continental drift,” now in the more sophisticated form of “plate tectonics,” win the para-digmatic debate in geology. The earth’s “plates” had more than moved, they were still mov-ing, albeit only a few inches a year.These two long-resisted new paradigms concern the movement of what establishedthought claimed to be immobile. All of Reich’s basic findings or his various new paradigmsconcerned spontaneous movement where it was not supposed to occur, for example, in thetotal bodily convulsions of the orgasm, the expansion and contraction of the bions, and thepulsation and movement of atmospheric orgone energy.That Reich could find an explanation for the world’s hostility to his findings in itsfear ofspontaneous movement; that there are many examples, long past and recent, ofeventually triumphant paradigms which have been ridiculed for generations—these argu-ments in themselves do not make his work convincing. Ultimately, the test of his work liesin replicating his experiments and developing new ones. Ultimately, a broad-based researchprogram must determine whether his paradigms fit the findings better than competing par-adigms.This kind of research is precisely what most orgonomic adherents have failed to doover the last forty years. Too often such adherents have been content to rail against theestablishment for not taking orgonomy seriously. Many enthusiasts have claimed lack of sci-entific training as their excuse for not repeating and developing orgonomic findings. Otherswith more solid scientific backgrounds (who have repeated some experiments) take refugefrom further inquiry in their lack of financial support, insufficient time, and the cloud ofscandal that has hung over orgonomy, especially since the FDA’s injunction in 1954.Granted that the social and scientific atmosphere has not been conducive to seri-ous orgonomic investigation, none of these arguments is sufficient to explain the neglect ofa potential scientific gold mine by persons who have good reason to believe a successfulstrike was possible. Reich explained this neglect as due to the deep fear of spontaneousmovement in orgonomic friend as well as foe. Again, such an explanation does not makeorgonomy any more “right.” However, it does help to make more comprehensible why fewhave tried to pursue the paradigm, so that we can see how fruitful or sterile it may be.I have underscored the vast silence surrounding the orgonomic findings outlined inthis chapter. There is another side. The steady trickle of experimental reports continues, justas there continues to be a steady sale ofReich’s books. Not surprisingly, many of thesereports come from people outside the scientific establishment. Kuhn has made an analogous21 : The Discovery of Orgone Energy: 1940273éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"point:Almost always the men who have achieved these fundamental inventionsof a new paradigm have been either very young or very new to the field whose par-adigm they change... .

We can expect that a serious debate over Reich’s revolutionary paradigms in biology andphysics will soon begin. Accompanying this ferment will be considerable controversy overhis medical concepts and findings.Myron SharafFury On Earth274éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948We have seen how Einstein’s rejection deeply disappointed Reich. However, he didnot dwell on his hurt and anger but reacted in his usual way to rebuff, by pursuing hisresearch all the more vigorously, as if to say, my work will yet prevail. And he gave specialattention to the medical effects of the accumulator, effects which, he had advised Einstein,could be useful in the war effort.To understand the use of the accumulator in the treatment of illness, we have toreturn first to the Oslo days. During 1937, Reich had observed that PA-bions immobilizedvarious kinds of bacilli. They also immobilized T-bacilli—one kind of bacteria resultingfrom the disintegration of animal tissue. The paralyzing effect of the PA-bions led Reich tohypothesize an antithetical relationship between these two organisms, with healthy proper-ties attributed to the PA-bions and noxious ones to the T-bacilli. Between 1937 and 1939,Reich ran a series of experiments injecting 178 healthy mice: some with T-bacilli alone, somewith PA-bions alone, some with PA-bions and then with T-bacilli, some with T-bacilli fol-lowed by PA-bions.The results largely supported his hypothesis. They showed that the Tbacilli inject-ed group had significantly more deaths within the experimental period than the PA-injectedgroup. The results also suggested that PA-bions had an inoculatory effect against T-bacilli,but could not reverse the damage done if T-bacilli were injected first1.When Reich investigated the cause of death in the thirty mice injected with T-bacil-li alone,he found that thirteen showed cancerous cell formations and another seven showedripe cancer cells in various tissues2.Reich thus came to America with the finding that T-bacilli apparently effected thedevelopment of cancer in mice and with preliminary evidence that PA-bions played somerole in combating this effect.Reich’s initial findings concerning the role of T-bacilli in the development of can-cer led to his spending much of the next four years, until about 1944, studying the etiologyand treatment ofcancer.Reich’s investigation of cancer represents one of the most lucid examples of theinterlacing of his psychiatric, sociological, biological, and physical research. It also becamethe most attacked part of his work. Because of his later assertion that the accumulator couldhelp(not cure) in the treatment of cancer, he was dismissed by practically everyone as a sin-cere but psychotic “former psychoanalyst” or as a swindler.In describing Reich’s work on cancer, I shall follow three main areas: his studies of275éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"the origin of the cancer cell; the clinical account of the cancer process, suggesting a bio-emotional disposition toward the illness; and his actual experimental treatment, first withmice and later with patients.The Origin of the Cancer CellThe first opinion Reich formed from his experimental production of cancertumors in mice was that the T-bacilli he injected were specific tumor agents. Thus, his initialthinking ran along traditional lines: a specific agent or virus for a specific illness. However,the T-bacilli did not prove to be specific for cancer. Reich examined samples of blood andof secretions, and found that T-bacilli could be obtained from persons who were perfectlyhealthy. For example, he found T-bacilli in a small erosion of his own tongue.This negative finding led him to shift the focus from the agent of the disease to thehost organism, in other words, to the question of “resistance to disease.” As Reich put it:“It is always reassuring to find the ‘specific cause’ of a disease. This enables us to delineatethe disease from healthy organisms in which this specific cause is absent. But this conceptis erroneous and blocks the approach to the nature ofimmunity, that is, the natural defensereactions ofthe organism... .”3It should be stressed that when in the early 19405 Reich asked these questions,“holistic medicine” and intensive immunological research had not yet become part of thecultural-scientific climate. Mann and Hoffmann have rightly asserted that Reich was one ofthe pioneers, if generally unacknowledged, in the shift from concern with the disease agentto the defenses of the host4.Reich had observed that while healthy blood and secretions also showed T-bacilli,in the case of cancer patients the T-bacilli developed easily and rapidly; the blood and excre-tions ofhealthy individuals, however, had to be subjected to a process ofdegeneration,sometimes lasting for weeks, in order toobtain T-bacilli.Reich reasoned that in a healthy organism the T-bacilli were destroyed bythe white blood cells. But if the organism was flooded by T-bacilli, then a secondary, patho-logical defense against the T-bacilli developed. The tissue and blood, weakened by the strug-gle against T-bacilli, began to decay prematurely into vesicles, both PA-bions and further T-bacilli.Very early in his American work, Reich’s concepts about the energetic processes inthe organism changed. After his discovery of atmospheric orgone energy, in 1940, he beganto think ofthe energetic charge of the tissues no longer as a “bio-electrical” but as an“orgonotic” charge. The energy he was observing in the atmosphere he believed to be thesame as the energy in the organism.Reich noted that in the blood of healthy individuals, one saw the PAbions sur-rounded by dead T-bacilli: the PA-bions had combated them successfully. He assumed thatthe struggle between PA-bions and T-bacilli took place all the time and everywhere in thehealthy organism. He further reasoned that the weaker the energetic charge of the PA-bions,Myron SharafFury On Earth276éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"the more would form in order to get rid of the T-bacilli present. So, as Reich put it, “Thecancer cell is in reality a product of the many PA-bions which were formed from blood ortissue cells, as a defense against the local auto-infection with T-bacilli.”5Reich was struck by a parallel here between the development of cancer cells in ani-mal tissue and the development of protozoa in disintegrating grass. He had already noticedthat it was extremely difficult or altogether impossible to obtain protozoa from infusions offresh spring grass, while autumnal grass gave an abundance of numerous protozoa. In thesame fashion, cancer cells developed in deader, less vital blood and tissue. The essentialpoint for Reich was that there was a functional identity between the development of proto-zoa in the grass infusion and of the cancer cells in the organism. Each developed from PA-bions in matter that had disintegrated. Neither developed in a young, flourishing organism,but both did so readily in a biologically damaged, “autumnal” host.Reich then followed the development of bions into bion heaps that aggregated intoclub-shaped cancer cells moving with a slow, jerky action, visible at a magnification ofsooox. He was able to distinguish five stages in the growth of cancer cells that eventuallyformed tumors. In the first stage, all that was apparent were changes in the shape of the nor-mal cells and the presence of T-bacilli within the cell and around its periphery in the adja-cent fluid.As a result of studying the blood in healthy and diseased mice, and later in healthyand sick people, Reich devised three tests for assessing the biological vitality of the blood.These tests have elsewhere been described in detail6; I shall limit myself here to a briefsummary of the main findings.Healthy red blood cells disintegrated much more slowly than blood from cancerouspatients or mice. When it did disintegrate, healthy blood broke up into large uniform gran-ules, whereas unhealthy blood disintegrated into shrunken granules. In another test proce-dure healthy blood, inoculated into a culture medium, left the culture clear after a day or twohad passed.Unhealthy blood yielded T-bacilli that caused the broth to turn putrid.The immediate significance ofthese tests was that they provided a crucial diagnos-tic tool. Unhealthy blood as defined by the above tests could be observed in stage one ofthe cancer process or well before the appearance of a tumor. A blood test showing abun-dant T-bacilli meant that the patient was a “high risk” candidate for tumor development.Preventive measures such as the regular use of the orgone accumulator were strongly indi-cated (see below).The blood tests illustrate well both the conceptual unity and the practicality ofReich’s work. Just as in psychiatry he had worked directly with the vitality or emotional-ener-getic flow of the organism, so in his biological work he focused on a similar kind of ener-getic expression. Biologically vigorous, strongly pulsating red blood cells show microscopi-cally a wide margin (or “energy field”) of an intense blue color, in contrast to sick cells,which show a reduced pulsation and a very narrow margin with a weak blue color. As withpatients,so in examining blood, Reich paid close attention to color, form, and movement.As with patients, he moved from broad theoretical formulations to concrete techniques and22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948277éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"findings, which in turn sharpened his conceptual lens.Reich also examined the sputum, excreta, and vaginal secretion of patients. Hisdescription both of what he saw and why others had not seen these relatively simple obser-vations in the past is worth quoting in some depth:Let us examine the sputum of a patient with lung cancer at magnificationsabove 2000x... . We find a wealth of very small lancet-shaped bodies which we didnot see below 2ooox. They have the same shape and motility as the T-bacilli whichwe can cultivate from degenerating tissue or blood, or from putrescent protein.Since T-bacilli are the result of tissue degeneration and putrid disintegra-tion, the conclusion is inevitable that a process of disintegration and putrefactionis taking place in the lung tissue... .In healthy living tissue and in healthy blood, examined at 2000x, we findexclusively such cells as are described in the literature as the normal constituents ofthe organism. Now let us examine blood, excreta, and tissues of a cancer patientwith carcinoma of the lung. We find formed cells and unformed shapes such as wenever see in healthy experimental animals or healthy humans. In particular, we findstriatedor vesicularstructures with a strong blue glimmerwhich look neither like cellsnor like bacteria... .In no comprehensive work on cancer is there as much as a mention of theexistence, let alone the form or variety ofliving, mobile cancer cells in living tissuesor in excretions. It is almost inconceivable that several generations of cancerresearchers can have so grievously erred7.On various occasions Reich would offer diverse explanations of why cancer cells inblood and excreta were overlooked. Traditional cancer researchers did not work withunstained specimens; they concerned themselves with substances and structures, but avoid-ed the primitive movements and energetic processes of the living. Indeed, the concern withstructure over movement also barred the use of higher-power magnification in cancerresearch, since at such magnification some details of structure are lost although finer move-ments can be observed.In addition, the high degree of specialization in modern scienceinhibited connections between different realms. Protozoa in grass were one thing, cancercells in the human organism quite another;neuroses were one thing, cancer quite another.Significantly, if orgonomic and traditional cancer research proceeded under quitedifferent assumptions and often used very different methods, some concordance in cancerfindings has emerged since the early 19405. Over the past two decades classical research hasbeen studying minute bodies called mycoplasmas, which have a number of properties incommon with Reich’s T-bacilli. Whether T-bacilli are identical with the mycoplasmas has notbeen established. But very similar forms, first obtained directly from cancer tumors in 1964,have been found to have a close association with cancer8.Reich’s ability to diagnose cancer by examination of cells in the body secretionsMyron SharafFury On Earth278éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"anticipated the PAP cervical smear test by at least fifteen years. The discovery that cancercells could be detected in the sputum of cancer patients before tumors developed was notmade by classical cancer pathology until 1955.Reich himself quoted the research of a number of cancer specialists who observedamoeboid forms in the tissues of cancer patients and paid no attention to them, believingthey were amoeboid parasites stemming from infection outside. Then in 1950, Enterline andComan published a paper in which they concluded that the amoeboid cells were not para-sites but were endogenous (arising from within) or derivatives of the cancer itself9.There is considerable conceptual overlap between Reich’s approach and currentimmunological research on cancer. Both focus on what goes wrong with the natural defens-es of the organism, or the individual’s “resistance to illness,” rather than on the toxic agent.The differences between the two approaches are also striking. Immunology stresses the fail-ure of the white blood cell system to combat “foreign bodies” properly; Reich emphasizedthe struggle between energetically weakened red blood cells and T-bacilli, with the resultingdisintegration of the cells into PA-bions and especially into further T-bacilli.The Bio-emotional Disposition to CancerBetween 1941 and 1943, Reich saw fifteen cases of cancer diagnosed at hospitalsand previously treated with X-rays. All were in advanced stages of the disease. Reich was notinitially drawn to the idea of seeing these patients psychiatrically. When he became immersedin the biology of the cancer cell, he confessed to a secret relief that he had gotten away fromthe “cursed sex problem” and could concentrate on organic pathology10. Yet when hecame to study the lifestyles of his patients, Reich found that he was again confronted, albeiton a much deeper level, with the problem of sexuality.In his cancer patients, Reich early noted that the cancer tumor was no more thanone symptom ofthe disease.Indeed,the Reich blood tests had indicated that a cancerprocess was at work well before the appearance of the tumor. Reich coined the term “can-cer biopathy” to convey the underlying process of cancer. And he used this term “biopathy”to cover a series ofillnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and schizophrenia. He felt that thebasic cause ofsuch degenerative diseases was a chronic malfunction of the organism’s bio-logical energy. These diseases were to be distinguished from infectious or bacterially causedillnesses, for the development of biopathies was largely dependent upon the patient’s emo-tional make-up. Whereas modern medicine has been extremely successful in comprehend-ing and preventing infectious disease, it has been unsuccessful in dealing with the biopathiesin any basic way.In Reich’s work with cancer patients we see once more his powers of acute obser-vation. He paid the same strict attention to the way their bodies and characters expressed orconcealed emotions as he had in his long study of neurotics. Here is Reich’s description ofone case that ofa woman whose hospital diagnosis was carcinoma of the left breast withbone metastases, pronounced hopeless:22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948279éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"The chin was immobile; the patient talked through her teeth, as if hissing.The jaw muscles were rigid... . The patient held her head somewhat pulled in andthrust forward, as if she were afraid that something would happen to her neck ifshe were to move her head. ...Respirationwas severely disturbed. The lips weredrawn in and the nostrils somewhat distended, as if she had to draw in air throughthe nose When asked to breathe out deeply, the patient was unable to do so; morethan that, she did not seem to understand what she was asked to do. The attemptto get the thorax into the expiratory position, that is, to push it down, met with avivid active muscular resistance. It was found that head, neck and shoulders formeda rigid unit, as if any movement in the respective joints was impossible. ...11Reichwas also concerned about her sexual life.She had been married unhappily for two years when her husband died. Sheinitially suffered from her sexual frustration caused by her husband’s impotence,but later “got used to it.” After her husband’s death, she refused any contact withmen. Gradually her sexual excitation subsided. In its place, she developed anxietystates; these she combated by way of various phobic mechanisms. At the time whenI first saw her, she no longer suffered from anxiety states; she appeared emotional-ly balanced and somehow reconciled to her sexual abstinence and her personal fatein general12.Far from abandoning his psychiatric lens, Reich was looking at his patients from agreat diversity of analytic viewpoints.Reich came to certain clinical generalizations about the “cancer biopathy” or theunderlying illness behind the tumor, which were later to be presented in The Cancer Biopathy(1948).Characterologically,cancer patients showed predominantly mild emotionsand resigna-tion.In this respect they could be distinguished from patients suffering from cardiovascularbiopathy, who were more emotionally labile, anxious, explosive. Both groups suffered fromsexual stasis,but in the cardiovascular cases the sexual excitation remained alive—biological-ly, physiologically, and psychologically. Cancer patients seemed to be affected in the core ofthe organism. “Chronic emotional calm ... must correspond to a depletion of energy in thecell and plasma system.”13Reich made the following comparison:In a running brook, the water changes constantly. This makes possible theso-called self-purification of the water. ... In stagnant water, on the other hand,processes ofputrefaction are not only not eliminated, but furthered. Amoebae andother protozoa grow poorly or not at all in running water but copiously in stagnantwater. We still do not know what this suffocation in stagnant water, or in the stag-nant energy ofthe organism, consists in; but we have every reason to assume theMyron SharafFury On Earth280éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"existence of such a process14.The characterological resignation led to a biopathic shrinking of cell functioning.Here Reich used a “core” model:Let us think of the biological, physiological and psychological functions interms of a wide circle with a center (core). The shrinking of the circle peripherywould then correspond to the characterological and emotional resignation. Thecenter, the core, is as yet untouched. But the process progresses toward the center,the biological core. This biological core is nothing but the sum total of all plasmat-ic cell functions. When the shrinking process reaches this core, then the plasmaitself begins to shrink15.He carefully noted that “these processes in cancer can only be deduced but notdirectly observed microscopically.” He could however observe the resignation of cancerpatients as well as the rapid disintegration of red blood cells or the presence of cancer cellsin sputum and excreta. And he postulated the intervening variable of a shrinking within theorganism’s core that led to the diminution of excitation and affect, to what he called “stag-nancy.”Muscularly, Reich found spasms in various body segments of cancer patients. Manyof these, especially in sexual areas such as the chest and pelvis, proved to be sites for tumordevelopment. The muscular rigidities were part and parcel of the deadening process con-ducive to tumors.Respiration in cancer patients proved chronically deficient. Here Reich connectedwith an earlier observation of Otto Warburg, who in 1924 had related oxygen deficiency tocancer.Recent research has noted several personality variables characteristic of cancer—resignation, loss of hope, an almost “painful acquiescence,” and emotional blockage. Thestudies have not yet conclusively demonstrated that these personality traits precededthe onsetofcancer.However, it has been found that cancer patients who can more freely express theiremotions have a better prognosis than those who do not16.Perhaps the most striking convergence between Reich’s approach and current psy-chosomatic research lies in the new field of psychoimmunology. This discipline has foundthat individuals who have undergone severe stress, such as loss of a loved one, are more like-ly than a control group to suffer disturbances in the immune system and reduced resistanceto diverse illnesses17.I cite these studies to suggest that Reich was years ahead of his time in connectingemotional states with the cancer process. His explanation provides physiological links (e.g.,reduced respiration) between the psychic attitude of resignation, on the one hand, and thecancerous tissue disintegration, on the other.Boadella has summarized this perceptively:Reich was far ahead of traditional cancer research, which only recently, in22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948281éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"a cautious and fragmentary way, has begun to understand some of the psychiatricimplications of cancer. ... It was almost uncanny the way each phase of his earlierwork had equipped him with the special skills needed to understand differentaspects of the cancer process. His work on the orgasm problem linked him withthose researchers who found aversion to sex linked with cancer; his studies of thecharacter-resistances linked him to those who found blocked emotions were typicalof cancer patients; his work on the ameboid movements in his bion cultures hadprepared him for the ameboid cancer cells that Enterline and Coman were to con-firm were derived from within and not from parasites. Similarly the studies of thebasic antithesis [expansion and contraction] had given Reich just that kind ofunderstanding of the contractionprocess as a total psychosomatic shrinking that wasnecessary if the cancer disease was to be comprehended18.Experimental Treatment with the Orgone Energy AccumulatorAs we noted, in Norway Reich had found that injections of T-bacilli led to cancerin many experimental mice. He had also found that SAPA-bions were the most effectivekind ofbions in killing T-bacilli. In America, these observations led him to conduct a seriesof experiments during 1940 involving the injection of cancer mice with SAPA-bions.Treated mice lived significantly longer than control cancer mice. “But finally all of themdied; in some the tumors had receded, in others it had first receded or disappeared and thengrown larger again.”19The Cancer Biopathyexplains in detail Reich’s partial success with SAPA-bion treat-ment. Suffice it here to note that blood tests showed that the red blood cells (erythrocytes)of the treated mice were taut and biologically vigorous, while the blood of the untreatedmice presented the typical picture of cancer: shrunken membranes of the erythrocytes, T-spikes,and abundant T-bacilli in the blood. Through these and other observations, Reichcame to the conclusion that the erythrocytes, charged with energy from the SAPA-bionswere the bearers of the therapeutic function, rather than the SAPA-bions themselves, as hehad originally thought.With the treated mice, Reich noted that many died not from tumors or from T-bacilli intoxication but from tumor remains clogging the kidneys. The larger the tumor, thegreater was this danger. In other words, they died from the results of the elimination of thecancer.During the extraordinarily productive year of 1940, Reich worked on a broad front:observing the visual effects of orgone energy, building an accumulator, and taking thermaland electroscopic measurements within it. In his work with the accumulator, he also experi-enced considerable prickling and heat sensations similar to those he had noted with SAPA-bions. Reich’s postulation of a common identity between the SAP A radiation and theatmospheric orgone energy led him to wonder whether the orgone accumulator itself mightnot be worth exploring as a treatment for cancer. If so, it would be much simpler to use thanMyron SharafFury On Earth282éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"SAPA injections. So, in 1940, he gave up the arduous and time-consuming injections andinstead kept cancer mice in the accumulator for one half hour each day. The results, inReich’s words, were startling:The very first tests revealed an astoundingly rapid effect; the mice recuper-ated rapidly, the fur became smooth and shiny, the eyes lost their dullness, thewhole organism became vigorous instead of contracted and bent, and the tumorsceased to grow or they even receded. At first, it seemed [unlikely] that a simple cab-inet, consisting of nothing but organic material outside and metal inside, shouldhave such a pronounced biological effect20.It is hard to imagine exactly how Reich felt when he first put cancer mice in a sim-ple wood and metal box. Certainly he must have doubted himself. The rationale for theSAPA-bion treatment at least had a history of several years; the accumulator had only beenstudied for six months when Reich started using it as a treatment agent. That he dared touse this laughably simple device to treat a terrible illness took rare courage and self-confi-dence. In retrospect, the most remarkable aspect of all was his resoluteness in the face ofridicule and attacks in pursuing so steadily his concepts, observations, and experiments.His daring paid off. The average life span of untreated cancer mice was four weeks,of SAPA-injected mice nine weeks, and of mice treated in the accumulator eleven weeks.Also, Reich, his colleagues, and his students began using the accumulator themselves andnoted a marked increase in their vitality.By early 1941, Reich felt prepared to start investigations of the accumulator withsick human beings. By this time his thinking about its therapeutic mechanism had alsoevolved. Initially, he thought that orgone energy in the accumulator simply penetrated theorganism like X-rays. However, this hypothesis did not explain why some persons who usedthe accumulator reacted to orgone energy immediately whereas others needed a number ofirradiations before they showed any reactions. Reich had also noted that the accumulatorfunctioned much better ifits walls were about four inches from the organism treated.Ignorance of this fact initially caused a series of failures. The effect of accumulators on micewas poor when they were treated in large accumulators built for humans. A third key obser-vation was that there was a slight rise in body temperature when persons used the accumu-lator21.These findings led Reich to change his hypothesis about the mechanism behind theaccumulator’s beneficial effect. He shifted from the more mechanical idea of orgone parti-cles hitting the organism within the accumulator to the notion of a mutual excitationbetween two energy fields—that of the organism and that of the accumulator. Here histhinking returned to earlier concepts: the attraction between two people with a “field ofexcitation” and the lumination he had observed between bions. This explanation fit the find-ing that energetically sluggish persons usually did not react to orgone energy in the accumu-lator until after a number of sessions.22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948283éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"In May 1941, Reich began using the accumulator in the treatment of cancerpatients.

They were about two feet six inches square in floor areaand about five feet high, so that when a person sat down inside he or she was surroundedclosely by the metal walls, without actually touching them. An aperture in the door, aboutone foot square, provided ventilation. According to the construction, the intensity of theenergy accumulation effect could be varied. Thus, walls made of alternating layers of celo-tex and sheet iron (later, layers of glass wool and steel wool were used for additional con-centration) increased the accumulation strength. The early accumulators were built of onlya few layers, up to five-fold. * When Reich’s first cancer patient sat inside for her thirty-minute treatments, sheexperienced the typical subjective reactions already described. She began to perspire, herskin reddened, and the blood pressure decreased. Cancer was a disease ofcontraction; theorgone accumulator provided an expansive therapy that stimulated parasympathetic inner-vation.However one seeks to explain the action of the accumulator, Reich found evidencefor its positive effect on the cancer patient. The hemoglobin content of her blood increasedmarkedly in three weeks. Her pains receded and she was able to sleep well without morphine.She was no longer bedridden and could resume her normal housework. Her breast tumorcould not now be palpated, after eight therapy sessions, although the entire treatment includ-ed many more irradiations.In spite of the patient’s vast symptomatic relief, the full danger of the cancer biopa-thy made its appearance only after elimination of the tumor. About four weeks after the startof orgone therapy, the patient became quite anxious and depressed. Though physically bet-ter, she now found herself in the tragic situation of waking up to new life, only tobe confronted by a nothingness. As long as she was ill, the tumor and resulting suf-fering had absorbed all interest.Indeed,her organism had used up great amountsofbiological energy in the fight against the cancer. These energies were now free,and in addition were amplified by the orgonotic charge. In a phase of particularlyintense depression the patient confessed that she felt herself ruined as a woman,that she felt herself to be ugly, and that she did not see how she could suffer thislife.She asked me whether the orgone energy could cure her neurosis also. This, ofMyron SharafFury On Earth284éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Not long after he designed these accumulators for total body irradiation, Reich devised two kinds of smaller,special purpose accumulators: the so-called shooter and the blanket. The “shooter” was a box about one cubic footin size, built with the same alternation of organic and metallic layers as the large accumulator. It was equipped witha hollow cable, one end of which was inserted through a hole into the box with the other end attached to a funnel.The funnel was then placed close to but not touching an injured part of the body for local irradiation. The flexibleblanket was constructed ofwire mesh with several layers of rock wool (organic) and steel wool (metallic) coveredon the outside with plastic. It was used for bedridden patients and for local application."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"course, I had to deny, and the patient understood the reason22.The patient’s subsequent complaints included pain but even more an intense fearof pain, strong fear of falling, and weakness to the extent of being bedridden for weeksagain. Reich offered to work with her in psychiatric orgone therapy and saw her for twohours every day. Now he noticed many of the usual reactions in character-analytic vege-totherapy, particularly the intense fear of falling and contractions in the face of pleasurableexpansion. Some improvement occurred, but it was followed by an unforeseeable catastro-phe: the patient fractured her left leg. In the next four weeks she declined rapidly, and final-ly died. Reich concluded: “The orgone therapy had prolonged her life for about ten months,and had kept her free of cancer tumors and cancer pains for months and had restored thefunction of her blood system to normal. The interruption of the orgone treatment ... inter-dicts any conjecture as to a possible favorable outcome.”23This case deserves further comment since it well illustrates Reich’s handling of can-cer cases, and, indeed, his overall approach. First, one cannot but be impressed by Reich’ssynthesis of various data—psychiatric, social, medical, biological—that were apparent in thecase history. As different aspects of the case emerged, he was ready with different weaponsfrom his own theoretical and technical arsenal. When the patient improved physically withaccumulator treatment, but then succumbed to depression and fear over the state of her life,Reich brought into play the psychiatric treatment he had evolved to deal with just such prob-lems. The oft-made criticism that he jumped from field to field does not so much miss asmake the point. It was the very multiplicity of his work that permitted his elucidation ofcomplex underlying aspects of the cancer process.It is also characteristic that Reich failed to report some of the elementary details ofthe case. Thus, we do not know the patient’s age. We know she had at least ten sessions inthe accumulator, followed by marked improvement, but there may have been more than ten,and we do not know ifthese sessions were daily.Reich speaks of the orgone accumulatoras the main treatment,with psychiatric therapy occurring only after her subsequent collapse.Still, he must have spent considerable time talking with her before more intensive psychiatrictreatment.As is often the case with his highly condensed writing, the specific sequence ofevents remains unclear.Third, in treating the patient described above, as well as other cancer patients whohad shown improvement, Reich noted that attending physicians and surgeons were singular-ly unimpressed by the results with the orgone accumulator. They simply ignored its help.One physician told the patient’s relatives that he was not interested in the accumulator untilit was “recognized by official medicine.”A frequent criticism of Reich’s treatment was that its real harm lay in deprivingpatients of genuine medical therapy. However, Reich was not opposed to the use of othertreatments for cancer in addition to the accumulator. In one particular case, he urged theexcision ofthe tumor even though it had decreased in size. On the other hand, he felt thatthe illness was being combated by the accumulator with sufficient efficacy to warrant a22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948285éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"delimited excision rather than a radical mastectomy. A surgeon at the Leahy Clinic in Boston,who was friendly to Reich’s work, agreed to this procedure and to the use of the accumula-tor post-operatively. The surgeon was later reproved by the hospital administration for coop-erating with a “Reichian” physician in pursuing this “unusual” treatment procedure.Fourth, Reich was often accused of promoting a “cancer cure.” Of the fifteen caseshe saw between 1941 and 1943, all were in advanced stages of cancer. Three patients diedas expected by their physicians’ estimates. Six patients lived five to twelve months longerthan expected before dying. In all cases, Reich reported that the pain was greatly alleviatedand the use of morphine reduced or eliminated. Six patients were still alive at the time Reichpublished his results (1943), but on none of these did he have a two-year follow-up24.Asin the case described, Reich was optimistic about the accumulator’s effect on the tumor butextremely guarded about its dealing with the underlying biopathy.When the Food and Drug Administration later attacked his cancer work, Reichdownplayed his optimism and highlighted his caution. Yet whatever the demurrals, hisreport in the above case that the tumor was no longer palpable after eight accumulator ses-sions can easily be read as an account of the miraculous. I do not know how justified Reichwas in stating a causal connection between tumor disappearance and accumulator use.Tumors sometimes—though rarely—disappear without any treatment. I am better able toassess his scientific style in sociology and psychiatry, with a suggested extrapolation to hismedical endeavors. In his enthusiasm for sex-politics, Reich was highly unrealistic about thepossibilities of rapid and positive social change; throughout his career he could overestimatethe effectiveness of his psychiatric therapy.In my view, his at times impaired scientific skepticism had at least three sources: anintense excitement about his findings, the desire to bury his enemies under a creative ava-lanche, and his intuition that only by going too far could he find out how far he could go.One has to be a great pioneer to be justified in employing such a risky approach. It remainsfor further investigation to determine the blend of pioneering discovery and unscientificerror in his medical work with the accumulator.Fifth,one ofthe constant rumors connected with the accumulator was that it wassome kind of “sex box” that promoted orgastic potency. Reich always vigorously denied thatthe accumulator had anything to do with “orgastic potency.” The increase in sexual excita-tion that this patient—and others—experienced through accumulator treatment occurrednaturally because, as they improved, less energy was needed to fight the illness. However, theaccumulator could not resolve the patients’fearof excitation nor their incapacity to dis-charge the excitation. Hence, it did not promote orgastic potency.Even though Reich did not claim a cure for the cancer biopathy, he did assert thathe had elucidated important avenues to the prevention of cancer. The route to such preven-tion was the same as the route to the prevention of neuroses. As he put it:These cancer patients brought again to my consciousness, in the sharpestfocus, what I had learned to see for the past twenty-eight years:the pestilence of theMyron SharafFury On Earth286éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"sexual disturbances. No matter how I tried to get away from it, the fact remained:Cancer is living putrefaction of the tissues due to the pleasure starvation of the organism.Thatthis extremely simple fact had hitherto been overlooked was not alone due to inad-equate research methods or the traditional errors of biology. I had hit upon it onlybecause I had to be consistent as a sex-economist and had to follow the results ofthe sexual disturbances no matter where the search was going to lead. What hasreally prevented this discovery from being made long ago is the prevailing conceptof life, the moralism, the sexual crippling of our children and adolescents, themoralistic prejudices in medicine and education... . We have outlawed the mostimportant life function, have given it the stamp of sin and crime and have deniedit any social protection... . We have lost confidence in the natural laws of life andnow we have to pay the price for it25.Reich saw the key to the prevention of cancer in mastering the sexual biopathies inchildren and adolescents, that is, in eliminating the unhealthy processes that lead not only tocancer but to any kind of biopathy. But in the case of cancer he had a more limited, simplerapprach: the widespread use of the accumulator as a preventive measure. “The orgone accu-mulator promises to become an important or even indispensable weapon in the fight forpublic health. It effects an orgonotic charging of the blood which increases the resistanceto disease The orgone accumulator thus will be an indispensable weapon in the fight againstdiseases which consist in decreased defense functions of the organism.”26It is a mark of Reich’s unbounded confidence that he could propose, for researchpurposes, a plan whereby ten thousand people would regularly use the accumulator. Theincidence of cancer in the “accumulator group” would then be compared with a matchedsample that had not used the accumulator. Within five years, such studies would yield defi-nite indications as to general cancer prevention.The plan was the more surprising at a time when,aside from a few score studentsand followers, Reich’s accumulator and his orgone energy aroused no interest whatsoever.But that did not stop him. On April 13, 1945, he founded the Orgone Institute ResearchLaboratories,which served as the distributing organization for accumulators. Until that time,Reich had refrained from letting patients have the devices in their homes, partly from med-ical considerations, since he wanted to keep a close watch in the initial period of experimen-tation.The one exception was Herman Templeton, the Maine guide who had sold Reichhis cabin near Rangeley back in 1940. Reich and Templeton became good friends. In late1941, Templeton contracted cancer and was given a year to live at most. During the summerof 1942, Reich saw his friend near death and persuaded the independent Templeton to buildhis own accumulator and use it in his home. Templeton did so and improved markedly; infact, he took on the job of constructing accumulators in Maine. From his workshop theywere then distributed to persons for whom Reich had prescribed them. When he died in1944, his daughter took over the enterprise.22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948287éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Templeton’s case clearly impressed Reich with the advantages of home usage:The patients who came to the laboratory for their orgone treatment were,every day, on their way “to the doctor.” Our friend was his own doctor. He coulduse the accumulator whenever he pleased. When he developed pain, he need notwait for the appointed hour with the physician, he could avail himself of theorgone immediately... . He had the leisure to become acquainted with the orgone,to make friends with it, as it were. ... He was not just the passive object of the treat-ment but he was active. He learned to think about the energy which so greatlyhelped him and to do something with it.27It is revealing to see this side of Reich’s personality. With the accumulator, he wasalways prepared to acknowledge his ignorance and to encourage the patient to find out forhimself or herself what was best: the amount of time for each sitting, the frequency of sit-tings, and the like. Once when a patient asked him how long to use the accumulator, hereplied: “We don’t know. We’re idiots about this energy. We know we have it but all the detailsremain to be discovered.Youfind out what’s best for you.“ And he replied in a similar fash-ion to a physician who inquired whether a twenty-fold accumulator should be used in a par-ticular case: “We don’t know the simplest things—whether to go fast or slow. We have tofind out.”28Whereas Reich’s physical findings concerning the accumulator had met largely withindifference from authoritative sources, his cancer research touched a raw nerve of mind-less opposition. In 1949, Austin Smythe, then secretary of the Council on Pharmacy andChemistry, published a scathing attack on the orgone accumulator in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association.His concluding paragraph read: “Inquiries received concerningthe ‘institute’publishing this nonsense indicate that the ‘theory’is promoted as a method ofcuring cancer.There is, of course, no evidence to indicate that this is anything more thananother fraud that has been foisted on the public and medical profession.”29Although Reich’s main medical efforts with the accumulator were directed towardcancer treatment, he also reported that accumulator treatment could dramatically reduce theincidence ofcolds and was extremely useful in promoting the healing of wounds and burns.Physicians working with Reich in the 19405 and early 19508 used the accumulatorto treat a variety of illnesses: angina, heart disease, hypertensive states, pulmonary tubercu-losis, and ichthyosis (a rare disease involving scaly, itching skin)30. Their case histories sug-gest positive results from accumulator treatment, but the number of cases seen was too fewto permit any conclusive judgment.In the late 19505,Dr. Bernard Grad, a biologist at McGill University who hadworked with Reich, conducted research on the accumulator treatment of leukemic mice.Treated mice lived no longer than untreated ones but autopsies disclosed that a significant-ly smaller number died of leukemia31.In 1975,Richard Blasband reported that accumula-Myron SharafFury On Earth288éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"tor-treated mice lived significantly longer than nontreated ones32.Then, in the mid-1960s, Dr. Bruno Bizzi, the vice-director of an Italian hospital,introduced orgone accumulators for the treatment of diverse human illnesses, including afew cases diagnosed as cancerous32. He also obtained positive confirmations in the reduc-tion of tumors and succeeded in interesting Professor Chiurco, the director of theInternational Research Center on PreCancer Conditions at Rome University. ProfessorChiurco in turn sponsored an international seminar on cancer prevention in Rome inOctober 1968, at which Dr. Walter Hoppe, an old colleague of Reich’s, presented a paper ona successful case with the orgone accumulator33.What can we say in 1982 about the use of the accumulator for the treatment andprevention of cancer and other illnesses? Very little that could not have been said in the early19508. There is an even greater paucity of medical replications than physical ones. Animportant factor here is the force of the injunction decree obtained by the FDA in 1954against the interstate shipment of the accumulator (to be described in Chapter 29). Thatinjunction, as we shall see, was legally binding only on Reich and the Wilhelm ReichFoundation. But the fact remains that as late as 1963 at least—six years after Reich’s death—FDA investigators were making inquiries to see if any physicians were prescribing the accu-mulator. In 1981 the FDA still displayed the accumulator in the media as one of the moreludicrous examples ofmedical quackery stopped by the agency’s assiduous efforts34,andthe Administration continues to exert its “chilling effect” on the medical use of the accu-mulator.The Journal of Orgonomy, edited by Elsworth F. Baker, M.D., has since 1967 publishednumerous articles on psychiatric and scientific orgonomy but none on the use of the accu-mulator with human beings. One reason for this omission is fear of disciplinary action bystate or professional organizations. Yet the fallout from the FDA injunction fails to explainthe paucity of studies in other countries.The growing shift in medicine from an agent- to a host-oriented perspective isbeginning to facilitate a reevaluation of Reich’s contribution to the origins of cancer. Let ushope that these changes in the intellectual climate will also encourage serious inquiry regard-ing Reich’s prodigious efforts to develop and utilize the orgone accumulator in the treatmentand prevention of cancer and other illnesses. Let us hope that the accumulator will be lib-erated from the shroud of stale clichés—such as Time’s obituary for Reich in 1957, describ-ing a “box”that “could cure common colds,.. . cancer and impotence”—under which itstill lies buried.22 : The Medical Effects of the Accumulator: 1940-1948289éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950After his arrival in America, all of Reich’s work with human beings was influencedby his discovery of orgone energy. Since he had already utilized energy concepts (callingthem libido and bio-electricity), his orgone energy findings represented no sharp break withhis previous clinical and social endeavors. However, in the 1940s he would make less use ofpsychoanalysis or Marxism in explaining man’s dilemmas; instead, his own views on humanhealth were to be featured more prominently.Psychiatric DevelopmentsReich’s psychiatric work in the United States, as earlier in Europe, provided themain source of financial support for his research as well as an opportunity for contact withpeople. Almost all of those who were in close touch with him during the 1940s were initial-ly interested in receiving therapy from him or learning his techniques. Usually both goalswere combined, especially after 1945, when Reich started to devote himself entirely to“training therapy,” as we shall see later.It is significant that amid all his activities, Reich was able to maintain a psychiatricpractice four to six hours a day. The financial needs of his research dictated this. In the early19405, he commanded a fee of $20 per session; by 1948, he was charging $50. Between 1936and 1950, Reich spent around $350,000 to support his own research1.Initially,Reich’s technique was very similar to the treatment he utilized in Norway.Indeed,his description ofthis therapy published in his first American book,The Function ofthe Orgasm(1942),was translated directly from a 1937 German monograph2.Then duringthe 19405,some important therapeutic developments took place, although Reich neverwrote them up in the detail with which he presented his natural-scientific findings.In this period,Reich’s major new therapeutic concept concerned the “segmentalarrangement of the armor.” The 1937 publication had shown him groping for a “law” cen-tral to the dissolution ofthe muscular armor. In America, he now conceived of the armoras consisting of various “segments” or “rings” that were at right angles to the spine. Thestreamings and bodily excitations—what Reich now perceived as a current of orgone ener-gy—flowed vertically along the body axis. The therapeutic battle lay between the armorrings, on the one hand, and the streamings of energy, on the other. As Reich put it, since“the armorings are in segments at right angles to the movement of the currents, it is clearthat the orgasm reflex cannot establish itself until after the dissolution of all the segmentalMyron SharafFury On Earth290éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"armor rings.”3What were the particular segments or armor rings? Reich discussed these in rough-ly the order he would deal with them in therapy. He started at the top of the body, or the“ocular” ring:In the ocular armor segment we find a contraction and immobilization ofall or most muscles of the eyeball, the lids, the forehead. ... This is expressed inimmobility of the forehead and eyelids, empty expression of the eyes or protrud-ing eyeballs, a masklike expression or immobility on both sides of the nose. Theeyes look out as from behind a rigid mask. The patient is unable to open his eyeswide, as if imitating fright Many patients have been unable to cry for many years.In others the eyes represent a narrow slit4.To illustrate more precisely how Reich worked with a particular segment, when Iwas in therapy with him, he would have me follow his finger with my eyes as he moved hisfinger sideways and up and down, now slowly, now rapidly. At the same time he would notewhether I was breathing naturally, as well as other aspects of my emotional expression.Sometimes he would make direct eye contact, asking me to open my eyes wide in fright ashe made a threatening look or gesture. On a few occasions the wide-eyed, frightened expres-sion brought up childhood memories of my fear of being kidnapped as I lay in bed lookinganxiously around me. We then discussed this fear and some of its psychological as well asbodily connections.It is worth noting once again the continuity in Reich’s therapeutic work, in spite ofsome real differences to be described later. His goals remained the same: the establishmentof the orgasm reflex in therapy and of orgastic potency in sexual life. The underlying con-ceptualization was also similar. We recall that in character analysis he worked from the sur-face to the depths,from the more superficial character traits (e.g., politeness) through todeeper emotions (rage, love). Now in psychiatric orgone therapy—as he began to call histherapy—he also worked from the top down, but with a difference. He started literally fromthe top ofthe body to loosen the horizontal armor rings in the way of the vertical flow ofenergy. Yet he was never mechanical in therapy.He worked on the totalbodily expression, emphasizing different segments at differ-ent times.The second armor segment, which Reich termed the “oral,” included the muscula-ture ofthe chin,the throat, and the back of the skull. Once one advanced to the secondring, the functional interplay of the segments became more apparent. Reich stressed that aparticular emotional expression, such as crying, would not fully emerge unless several armorrings were released. Working with the armoring of the chin might release the impulse to cry;but if armoring in the ocular segment had not previously been loosened, it would be diffi-cult fully to liberate the crying impulse.Reich retained an earlier interest from character analysis in the tone of voice. He23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950291éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"noted that with armor in the throat, the voice is “usually low, monotonous, ‘thin’ ... In thiscondition, one will try in vain to talk with a loud and resonant voice. Children acquire suchconditions at a very early age, when they are forced to suppress violent emotions to cry.”5The third segment centered on the deep neck musculature and the upper back. Inworking with the second and third segments, Reich was confronted with a problem: the ther-apist cannot put his or her hands on the larynx as he can on the superficial neck muscles.Here Reich used a very simple technique but one that carried great force. He simply askedthe patient to put his finger down his throat and gag. This technique was used to combat thepatient’s tendency, learned in childhood, to “swallow down” feelings of anger and sorrow.With successful gagging, or what Reich called “eliciting the gag reflex,” the swallowed emo-tions were “thrown up,” often with literal vomiting. (A bucket became part of Reich’s ther-apeutic equipment.) Reich was a superb teacher, a kind of conductor, of gagging. He taught his patientsnot to force the gagging by rapidly sticking their fingers down their throats, all the whileholding their breath and bracing against the gag reflex. Rather, he would have them do itslowly, gently tickling the back of the throat; he would urge them not to swallow, to keepbreathing, to make a wha-a-asound as they gagged. At such moments he became a kind ofexorcist fighting the devil of swallowing and blocking the gag reflex.The fourth segment is the chest; the fifth comprises essentially the diaphragm, thestomach, the solar plexus, pancreas, liver, and two always plainly evident muscle bundlesalongside the lower thoracic vertebrae; the sixth segment includes the spasm of the largeabdominal muscles, a specific contraction of the lateral muscles that run from the lower ribsto the upper margin of the pelvis, and, in the back, armoring of the lower sections of themuscles; and the seventh segment is the pelvic segment.The reader is referred to Chapter XV ofCharacter Analysisfor a more completedescription of the armor segments. Here I shall limit myself to some general comments.In his discussion of the armor rings, Reich was not concerned with a mechanicalsoftening ofthe musculature.He constantly sought to correct the false impression that psy-chiatric orgone therapy consisted of some kind of massage because it involved the “layingon of hands/’ Again and again he would say that “therapy does not consist of working on‘tensions’or ‘muscles’ as such, but of working on emotions—on the expressionofemo-tions.”6In working with each segment, Reich studied the extent to which a patient couldexperience an emotion throughout his or her body. Thus, working on the throat block mightelicit crying.Reich would then be concerned with the depth and extent of the crying. Hewould pay careful attention to whatever part of the body was not entering the total emo-tional experience. If the patient was angry, were the eyes, the voice, the arms, the legsexpressing anger? If one part held back, Reich would then focus his attention on the non-participating segment.Reich’s interest in the function of respiration, sharply evident in Norway, becameeven stronger in America. His eye was especially tuned to seeing subtle manifestations ofMyron SharafFury On Earth292éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"blocked respiration. Much of his therapeutic work now centered upon dealing with suchblocks. Forced breathing (“No Yoga exercises, please!”), shallow breathing, closing thethroat against the breath all—such expressions of inhibited respiration drew his lightning-like attention.Just as Reich organized the therapeutic process around the orderly dissolution ofsegments, so he also organized therapy toward the orderly expression of emotions. One ofhis crucial diagnostic questions was: Which emotion is closest to the surface? Is the patientmore afraid of crying than of being angry, or vice versa? It was a cardinal mistake for thetherapist to press for crying if anger was in fact closer to the surface. Thus Reich’s concernfor an orderly therapeutic process sharply distinguishes his work from some of theneoReichian, encounter-type methods, which press for “letting feelings out” in a chaotic way.Some syntactical confusion arose around 1945, when Reich changed the name ofhis psychiatric treatment from “character-analytic vegetotherapy” to “psychiatric orgonetherapy.” In the public’s mind the latter term became confused with accumulator treatment,which Reich termed “physical orgone therapy,” It was extremely characteristic of Reich tomake this change in terminology even though he thereby contributed to the common mis-conception that the accumulator could, like psychiatric orgone therapy, promote “orgasticpotency”and the associated misconception that the use ofthe accumulator was part of“psychiatric orgone therapy.” Although Reich had become convinced that he was dealingwith one and the same energy whether he was releasingorganismic orgone energy fromarmor segments in psychiatric treatment or confiningatmospheric orgone energy within theaccumulator, the commonality and differences between the two treatments were not alwaysclear to the reader. As always, the clarity of concepts and terminology in his rapidly integrat-ing mind meant more to him than carefully fostering clarity in everyone else’s mind.By the mid-1940s, then, we see Reich studying the psychiatric interplay between twoforces: streamings of energy, on the one hand, and segmental amor rings, on the other. Reichnever failed to pay considerable attention to character traits, but the linking of these withearly family history and unconscious memories was often done in a cursory fashion. He wastired ofpsychoanalysis, even though he once said to me after making a fewinterpretations:“You see, this work involves more than ‘squeezing the muscles/ We are not against goodpsychoanalysis.”7In my view, Reich’s impatience with verbal techniques hurt his efficacy as a practic-ing therapist.Patients need to talk a good deal about their past and present lives as well aswork through armor segments. The most harmful aspect of his movement away from analy-sis was his tendency, at times, to veer too far from the wise aspects of the analytic principleof“neutrality “:for example, the therapist should not meet the patient’s hate with hate, butrather should help the patient to understand the infantile sources of his or her transferredrage. Reich could a time be blind to the shortcomings of patients who stirred his own infan-tile positive feelings and he could be unduly angry at others who evoked his old insecuritiesand rages.This weakness of Reich’s was very apparent in Norway (as we saw in Chapter 18),but it was more pronounced than ever in America and it provided ammunition for his oppo-23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950293éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"nents, especially psychoanalysts.However, I would also argue that his downplaying of psychoanalysis facilitated thedevelopment of his energy-block paradigm. Reich opened up a new domain through hisalmost exclusive emphasis on the emotional, the energetic, the wordless. Today, it is time forthe “mopping up” phase of “normal science,” in Kuhn’s words, to make room withinReich’s revolutionary paradigm for a more extensive and judicious use of verbal techniquesthan he was able to employ in his late years.One of Reich’s most substantial contributions to psychiatry occurred in 1941-42,when he had a schizophrenic patient in psychiatric orgone therapy for the first and onlytime. This young woman, previously hospitalized for many years, came to Reich on the rec-ommendation of her brother, a student of Reich’s. The psychiatrist at the state hospitalwhere she had been treated and where she still went on an outpatient basis agreed to herentering therapy with Reich. The encounter between Reich and his schizophrenic patientwas extraordinary, as revealed in the case history that was written six years later, in 1948, andpublished in 19498. (Indeed, it is the only detailed case history Reich ever published.) There is great gentleness in the way in which Reich treated this patient. With psy-chotic patients, as with impulsive characters, it was not a question of breaking throughdefenses to get to deeper feelings. Feelings were out in the open, if distorted—the impul-sive character through his acting out, the schizophrenic through his delusions and projec-tions. While he never romanticized the schizophrenic in the fashion of R. D. Laing and oth-ers, Reich did appreciate the candor with which the schizophrenic spoke of his or her innerprocesses:Every good psychiatrist knows that the schizophrenic is embarrassinglyhonest. He is also what is commonly called “deep,” i.e., in contact with happenings.When we wish to learn something about human emotions and deep human expe-riences,we resort as biopsychiatrists to the schizophrenic and not to homo normalis[Reich’s term for the average character neurotic]. This is so because the schizo-phrenic tells us frankly what he thinks and how he feels, whereas homo normalistellsus nothing at all and keeps us digging for years before he feels ready to show hisinner structure9.Reich’s new comprehension of orgonotic energy functions was immensely helpfulin understanding the patient’s symptoms. She felt both protected and persecuted by “forces,”the nature of which she did not understand. Reich began to view her “forces” as a projec-tion of her body sensations. In therapy, he did not argue as to whether the forces were realor not. Rather, he kept coming back to her fear of her bodily streamings, especially her gen-ital sensations. In an extremely vivid and dramatic account, the case history described thestruggle between Reich and the patient, and within the patient herself, to permit her toaccept her body feelings. Nowhere else in Reich’s writings does the fear of the streamings,Myron SharafFury On Earth294éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"of strong genital sensations, emerge more graphically. He also stressed more carefully thanever the importance of the gradualrelease of emotion and energy flow so that the patientwas not overwhelmed.The most notable advance, however, was the attention Reich paid to the eyes, forhe viewed schizophrenia as involving a split between sensation and perception. Whereas theneurotic person shut off his or her deeper sensations completely by means of heavy armor,the less armored schizophrenic was in touch with these sensations but distorted them. Theschizophrenic suffered from a specific disturbance in eye contact—contact with his or herown inner processes and with the external world. One expression of this eye block was thetypical “far-away” look of schizophrenic patients. As he worked with his patient, Reichfound that the eye block intensified whenever she experienced an increase in pleasurablestreamings in her body. “I ventured the preliminary assumption,” Reich wrote, “that the‘going off in the eyes was due to a local contraction of the nerve system at the base of thebrain. According to this assumption this contraction had the same function as all other bio-pathic contractions: to prevent too strong bodily streamings and sensations.”10The patient made considerable gains during the three months of orgone therapy.However, the treatment was broken off at one phase when her anxiety mounted with theincrease in pleasurable feelings and her self-destructive acts reached dangerous proportions.Reich, the patient, and the patient’s family believed treatment could continue on an outpa-tient basis in spite of the dangers involved. The hospital psychiatrist felt differently. Aftersome months in the hospital, the patient was discharged and subsequently maintained theimprovement she had achieved with Reich. She was able to work and function, althoughproblems remained in her love life. Her clinical picture was much more neurotic than psy-chotic at this point. The essential experiment over, Reich referred the patient for continuingtreatment to an orgone therapist he himself had trained.Our immediate concern is not really with the improvement of this patient—formany schizophrenics do improve from diverse treatments and with no treatment at all—butrather with Reich’s conceptualization of schizophrenia and with the techniques he formulat-ed for treating it. Let us look at the scientific issues and also what it meant for Reich person-ally.First,significantly, he spoke of schizophrenia as a disease of the brain. As a psy-choanalyst he had long opposed traditional organic explanations of mental illness, as beingdue to some genetic defect,for example. Reich opposed such physical explanations partlybecause schizophrenics had been stored away for so many years in mental hospitals in thebelief that they suffered from “brain damage,” and no brain pathology was ever found.However, now that an emotionalfactor in the form of armoring emerged as a “local contrac-tion of the brain due to severe anxiety,” he was much more disposed to consider schizophre-nia a “brain disease.”The significance of this formulation lies in what Reich did with it. The task was notto operate on the brain (or give electric shock treatment, both treatments Reich opposed)but to help the patient tolerate intense sensations without “going off” in the eyes—rolling295éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"the eyeballs upward. It also influenced Reich’s formulations on early infancy, especially theimportance of eye contact between mother and infant, a subject to be discussed in the lastsection of this chapter. Equally significant was Reich’s openness to ideas that permitted old,previously rejected concepts to be reinterpreted. As he once put it: “Everybody is right insome way; it is a question of finding out in what way.”11The very severity of the schizophrenic illness permitted Reich to be more daring inhis therapeutic concepts than hitherto. (The same quantum leap in therapy, we recall,occurred when Reich treated a difficult case of masochism in the late 1920s.) For example,the patient suffered a severe throat block, a block Reich related to her fear of being stran-gled and her fear of strangling. As Reich put it:Our patient had suffered several decades of cruel monstrosities on the part of hernagging mother. She had developed the impulse to choke her mother in order to defend her-self. Such impulses are very strong and cannot be fought off in any other way than by armoring against thewelling up of the murderous hate in the throat.Quite spontaneously, the patient asked me whether I would permit her to choke mythroat. I confess that I felt, not embarrassed, but a bit frightened; however, I told her to goahead and do it.The patient put her hands very cautiouslyaround my throat and exerted aslight pressure; then her face cleared up and she sank back exhausted. Her respiration wasfull now12.Another important aspect was the human situation between the patient and Reich.In the early 1940s, as we have seen, Reich experienced little empathy not only from the worldbut also from many of his colleagues. On the other hand, his schizophrenic patient had con-siderable contact, albeit in a distorted fashion, with energetic processes within her organism.At times she perceived her “forces” as being on the walls of the room; at other times, shefelt outside herself. Reich saw these distortions as projections of her own energy, not sim-ply as projections ofideas and feelings.At various points the patient made references to thesun as containing the same kind ofenergy as the forces. Reich was staggered to see how thepatient, even if in a confused way, could link up her own energy (the “forces”) with exter-nal energies (the sun,the aurora borealis).The poignancy of the encounter is enhanced if we keep in mind that during theperiod Reich was treating the patient, he himself was frequently being described as schizo-phrenic. Like his patient, Reich was seeing energy everywhere and describing “currents” inhis body. Characteristically, he turned around the whole accusation of being crazy by exam-ining more closely what craziness was, and finding it in many ways superior to so-called nor-mality.Reich’s work on schizophrenia illustrates once again how the different aspects ofhis research mutually enriched each other. His intensive investigations of physical orgoneenergy alerted him more than ever to the disturbance in energy flow in patients, to the pro-jections ofenergy in the schizophrenic, to the concrete reality his patient was referring to—albeit in a distorted way—when she spoke of her “forces.”Myron SharafFury On Earth296éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Reich’s energy-block paradigm yielded great therapeutic hope, at least in the casehistory described above. If the patient had not yet become “orgastically potent,” Reichimplied that with further therapeutic work she would eventually do so. Yet at the same time,the more Reich was in touch with the power of streamings, of organismic orgone energy,the more he also appredated the “obstacles in the way”—the armor segments, the intensefear, indeed terror—in the face of surrender to the flow of orgastic excitation. However,Reich was so committed to the principle of orgastic potency that he never made clear pub-licly, though he sometimes did privately, that very few patients actually achieved orgasticpotency. In his own way he contributed to the “cult” of the orgasm through his rather opti-mistic case history vignettes and this detailed case history of the schizophrenic patient.Apart from the question of results, Reich continued to deplore the social inadequa-cy of therapy. Indeed, he resented the fact that the therapists he had trained were, largely,interested only in private practice and devoted little effort to education or to research. Oncewhen an educator contemplated becoming a therapist, Reich said sharply: “No, if you dothat, you will just make a lot of money and do no work.”13An intensely social animal, Reich never wanted to limit himself to the treatment ofa relatively few privileged people. He was genuinely concerned with social and educationalchange, and with public policy.Sociological DevelopmentsThis same period marked a turning point in Reich’s social thought, a period inwhich we see the idiosyncratic quality of his thought emerge. It was as though his ownthinking itself had to emerge from a kind of armor—the armor of wrong, culturally inher-ited ideas or the armor that reflected his own problems.Here, too, the social environment played its role. Just as Marxism and apparentprogress in the Soviet Union had spurred on his sex-political concepts in the 1920s, so thefailure ofthe Russian Revolution in the 1930s, culminating in the Nazi-Soviet pact ofAugust 1939,led him to revise many of his ideas, such as the readiness of people for a rev-olution and the capacity of leaders to help them. As with his move away from classical psy-choanalysis,the movement of his social thought was gradual. Although he left theCommunist Party in 1933, it took the rest of the 1930s before he broke clearly with Marxistpolitical theory.Reich’s movement away from radical politics and Marxism was also encouraged byhis American experience. He found in the United States a greater openness compared toEurope,less concern with hierarchy, and more willingness to experiment. The trend towarda more permissive upbringing of children, which Spock both reflected and promoted in his1946 publication Baby and Child Care, was already manifest in the early 1940s. It deeplyimpressed Reich, especially in its contrast to what was occurring in the Soviet Union. There,even co-education had been abolished.Nothing in Marxist theory could explain the progres-sive, evolutionary movement toward freedom within capitalist America, while “socialist”23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950297éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Russia witnessed reactionary, antisexual developments.His disappointments in America were not of the kind to lead him back to hisMarxist political orientation. Thus, he found the American trade union movement very mid-dle class. He never expressed the fondness for the industrial worker of America that he hadfelt for the European proletariat. He did have a positive regard for the rural Maine crafts-men, but such workers were not radical or even politically active.Most important to the evolution of his social concepts was the totality of his work.His investigations of orgone energy permitted him to see more vividly than ever howblocked the flow of this energy was in human beings. His research on cancer and schizo-phrenia in the 19405 pointed to an early development of such blocks and highlighted howdifficult they were to remove once they became chronic. His optimism about the averagehuman being, badly damaged by his disillusionment with the Russian experiment, dimin-ished still further. Political appeals, right or left, seemed ever more like a pandering to thepublic. The government in power, the Jews, the bosses, the Bolsheviks were all to blame, butnever the average citizen with his armoring and his resulting fear of freedom and responsi-bility. For Reich in the 1940s it was precisely the masses themselves who had become thechief obstacle to human freedom: “As a result of thousands of years of social and educa-tional warping,the masses ofthe people have become biologically rigid and incapable offreedom. They are no longer capable of organizing a peaceful living-together.”14The changes in his social thinking led Reich to ponder a good deal before hebrought out The Mass Psychology of Fascismin an American edition in 1946. The original text,published in German in 1933, brimmed with Socialist fervor. In going over it in 1943, Reichnoted that most of the book had stood the test of time: “I ... found that every word per-taining to sex-economy was as valid as years previously while every party slogan which hadfound its way into the book had become meaningless.”15What Reich did was to make rel-atively minor but significant changes in the text to reflect his current position, which wasbecoming evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The words “Communist” and “Socialist”were replaced by “progressive.” “Class consciousness” became “work consciousness” or“social responsibility.”The change in Reich’s social thought represented more than just a shift from a rev-olutionary outlook. At one level, he had come to despair of politics itself. As he expressedit: “Put an end to all politics! Turn to the practical tasks of real life!” To replace politics,Reich introduced the concept of “work democracy” (1946). By work democracy he meantthe “natural process of love, work, and knowledge which has always governed economy andthe social and cultural life ofman and always will, as long as there is a human society. Workdemocracy is the sum total of all naturally developed and developing life functions whichorganically govern rational human relationships.”16As Paul Goodman noted,Reich’s formulation of work democracy had much incommon with anarchism17. The difference between Reich’s approach and those of anar-chist groups was that Reich did not advance work democracy as a new political goal ororganize a new political movement around it. He regarded it as the natural form of socialMyron SharafFury On Earth298éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"organization that existed whenever people cooperated harmoniously in the service of com-mon needs and mutual interests. Just as in individual therapy one did not “acquire” orgasticpotency, one removed the obstacles in the way of a naturally given function; so one did notorganize or “get “ work democracy. Rather, one removed the obstacles in the way of the nat-urally given work-democratic functions. But this was no easy task. Reich therefore formulat-ed certain maxims:(a) The masses of people are incapable of freedom;(b) The general capacity for freedom can be acquired only in the dailystruggle for a free life;(c) It follows that the masses, who are incapable of freedom, must havesocial power if they are to become capable of freedom and capable of creating andmaintaining freedom.Reich never resolved the dilemma of how sick individuals could take social powerand become capable of freedom. At various points in his writing he suggested certain direc-tions, but these indications never amounted to a clear program. For example, in the 1930she emphasized a long-standing concern for the industrial worker’s alienation from the totalwork product plus the monotony of labor in a highly rationalized, modern industrial socie-ty. He saw one of the major tasks of progressive social development as finding ways to per-mit workers an involvement with the work product and with decisionmaking about work; atthe same time, ways had to be found to accomplish these goals without losing the benefitsof rationalization and division of labor. In these hopes Reich anticipated certain industrialexperiments such as those in various Japanese industries and the work at the Volvo compa-ny in Sweden, where teams of workers participate in different aspects of the total produc-tion process as well as in decisions concerning work conditions.Reich was quite aware that work democracy could not replace political struggle inthe near future. When he said, “Put an end to all politics!” he was expressing a long-rangegoal.In the meantime he was all too aware that political forces would contend with oneanother and that there were “lesser evils.” He never took the position, like the anarchists, ofsaying:a plague on all your parties and governments. He made choices in the real world: forthe United States and the Allies over Germany, for the United States over the Soviet Union,for Roosevelt over his Republican opponents, and in the 1950s, as we shall see—forEisenhower over his Democratic rival.From the 1940s on, Reich never lost sight of the fact that there could be no polit-ical organization oforgonomic findings. His basic position was that his work would have topenetrate quietly and organically, the way a tree grows, in one of his favorite analogies. It didnot need—indeed, it would be killed by—an organization made up of “believers” whowould “vote” for orgonomy. Reich was impressed with the failure not only of Marxism butofother revolutionary ideas such as Christianity. He felt the discrepancy between truth andpower. He would have agreed heartily with Thoreau’s statement: “Just as when there is a lull23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950299éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"in the wind a snowdrift piles up, so when there is a lull in truth an organization springs up.”What orgonomy needed, he felt, was not a political party but people with skills—physicians, nurses, scientist—who could root orgonomic findings in practical endeavors andwho would win the respect of people through concrete accomplishments. It could not forceits way.Yet Reich always had problems distinguishing between short-term and long-termrealities. At times he wrote as though there could be protection now for the truth in gener-al and for his work in particular, even though the masses were armored. Indeed, sometimeshe asked not just for freedom for his work but for the suppression of “irrational” opinion:“General formulations such as the ‘freedom of the press, of expression, of assembly,’ etc.,are a matter of course, but far from sufficient. For under these laws, the irrational individ-ual has the same rights as the rational one. As weeds always grow more easily and rampant-ly than other plants, the Hitlerite will inevitably win out.”18There were other signs of Reich’s desire for immediate control over “irrationality.”For example, he pointed out that one needed a license for such mundane activities as bar-bering, “but there is still no law for the protection of newborn infants against the parents’inability to bring up children or against the parents’ neurotic influences.”19Reich alsobelieved that “every physician, teacher or social worker who will have to deal with childrenmust show proof that he or she ... is sex-economically healthy and that he has acquired anexact knowledge of infantile and adolescent sexuality. That is, training in sexeconomy mustbe obligatory for physicians and teachers.”20It is so characteristic of Reich that he called for the requirement of sex-economiceducation at a time when such education was quite taboo. There is the typical defiant asser-tion that the rightful place ofhis work in a decent society should be granted right now.ButReich never solved the question ofwho decideswhich potential parents are neurotic; whichteachers are sexually healthy; whose speech is irrational. Reich never intended there to besome kind ofvote on these matters. He believed that healthy people should decide—peo-ple like himself. They would fail, not least because the masses would never select people whotold them what was wrong with them.In the meantime,in spite of his awareness of the extreme difficulty of real socialchange, Reich’s bitterness and impatience with the masses grew. By the time he wrote Listen,Little Man!in 1945 (published in 1948),it was the “average man” who received his thunderand condemnation21.Listen, Little Man!is about the “average person,” but it is also writtenfor him or her as the “ideal reader.” The prose is clear and simple. Whereas in his psychi-atric writings Reich speaks of “chronic muscular spasms” and the like, now he says the samething in basic English,Addressing the “Little Man”: “You can only ladle in and only take,and cannot create and cannot give, because your basic bodily attitude is that ofholding backand ofspite.”Reich used the term “little man” in various senses. One meaning was the “commonman”the “man in the street.” At other times, Reich had in mind the “average man” who hasgained power—Stalin or Truman (whose use of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima andMyron SharafFury On Earth300éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Nagasaki Reich always excoriated). In the largest sense,Listen, Little Man!was addressed toall men and women, for we are all little in some ways and at some times. Reich meant by “lit-tle man” something akin to what Flaubert meant by “bourgeois”: “I call ‘bourgeois’ whoev-er thinks meanly.” The great man, Reich writes, was also once a little man, but “he learnedto see where he was small in his thinking and action.”Listen, Little Man!served a further function for Reich: he used it to settle old scores.The reader familiar with Reich’s life can recognize, though they remain unnamed, old ene-mies and “betrayers”—Paul Federn, Otto Fenichel, party hacks from his Communist days inBerlin, Leiv Kreyberg and Johann Scharffenberg from the Oslo campaign, Berta Bornsteinand Albert Einstein, to name but a few who make cameo appearances in the book.Still, the main target is the “common man.” Reich was like an Old Testamentpreacher denouncing the stiff-necked, the hard of heart, the withholding, but a preacherinformed by knowledge of the armor and of orgastic impotence:Your taking, basically, has only onemeaning: You are forced continuouslyto gorge yourself with money, with happiness, with knowledge, because you feelyourself to be empty, starved, unhappy, not genuinely knowing nor desirous ofknowledge.For the same reason you keep running away from the truth, Little Man:it might release the love reflex in you. It would inevitably show you what I, inade-quately, am trying to show you here.Reich had said the same things in Character Analysisand elsewhere, but with detach-ment and empathy for the neurotic condition. Now he was writing with tremendous forceand eloquence, but also with a note of harsh blame, as though the “little man” had chosento be the way he was, Reich never wrote about cancer patients as though their cancer cellswere ugly. But he wrote about the little man’s character traits, fully as determined as cancer,as though they were despicable. I once told Reich that I preferred the quiet tone of many ofhis other publications to Listen, Little Man! He agreed but said: “Everybody else has achance to wipe offtheir mouth, so why shouldn’t I?”22The tone ofListen, Little Man!wassomewhat softened by the illustrations of William Steig, the noted cartoonist and a close fol-lower ofReich’s during the 1940s, as we shall see. His illustrations were sharply satiric butetched with a wit and empathy Reich often lacked.Let us look more closely at these outbursts of rage, which so resembled those ofReich’s father. Freud once said of himself that he needed two people in his life, one to love,one to hate. Reich also needed someone to hate. However, in addition to the vengeful qual-ity ofhis rage, there was another side. It is a side well captured by Alfred Kazin in hisdescription of Flaubert’s anger:Anger is a great quality, a classic quality, and one rarely evident today, forwhat most people feel just now is usually resentment and bitterness, the telltale feel-ings of people who consider themselves imposed on, who know that they are not23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950301éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"getting their due, who feel small Flaubert’s anger, on the contrary, is that of a pow-erfully caged beast ... of a man who, feeling his strength to the uttermost, is con-tinually outraged by the meanness, the self-seeking, the lowness, the vulgarityaround him. It is because he feels his strength unlike most of us today who feel onlyour weakness that he is so magnificently angry...23.Still, Reich was saddened that the little man could not stay with his moments ofdepth and intensity. As Saul Bellow has Augie March say: “Intensity is what the feeblehumanity of us can’t take for very long.” Nothing hurt Reich more than the failure of peo-ple to take for long his intensity and the intensity of orgonomy.While Reich’s anger was directed at the little man, his even greater fury was direct-ed toward a particular kind of little man whom he termed the “emotional plague charac-ter.”24By “the emotional plague,” Reich meant the destructive acting out of neuroticimpulses. Whereas the ordinary “little man” limited himself or herself to taking and notgiving, to being spiteful, to avoiding conflict, the little man with the emotional plague wasactively destructive toward expressions of life. To give Reich’s favorite example distin-guishing the two types: People who sit quietly on their porch, minding their own businessbut giving little to others, are character neurotics. People who maliciously gossip abouttheir neighbors, who organize with others to persecute one or another “immoral” person,suffer from the emotional plague.By the late 1940s, Reich was becoming increasingly concerned with the way cer-tain individuals who suffered severely from the plague interacted with the average individ-ual or the character neurotic. In his own experiences as well as in the case of other inno-vators, he found very often one or two people (people with the emotional plague) whoactively stirred up the average person’s hatred. In his own case, he found the average per-son indifferent,ifnot initially friendly, toward his work. (As we know, Reich could at timesexaggerate the degree of people’s receptivity to orgonomy.) Then one or two would begingossiping viciously about Reichian “orgies” and the like. The average person would notstand up to the rumormongers for a variety of reasons, not least because he feareddefamation himself for whatever “indiscretions” he had committed.No example more beautifully illustrates this process than the late J. EdgarHoover, who tried to destroy Martin Luther King, Jr., with the threat of publicizing infor-mation about King’s sex life obtained by concealed tape recorders. Hoover could get awaywith these tactics because others refrained from opposing him, partly out of fear of whathis files may have had on them.Reich was not only condemnatory of the emotional plague. He believed that peo-ple thus afflicted were richly endowed with energy and had the potential for considerableemotional and intellectual achievement. However, because their armor was also strong,they were incapable of developing their positive impulses. The resulting severe tensionmade them especially envious and destructive toward others who could flow more freely.Myron SharafFury On Earth302éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"The envy in turn was highly rationalized. Coleridge spoke of the “motiveless malignity”of Iago toward Othello because none of his stated reasons for persecuting Othello heldwater when examined closely. In Reich’s description of the plague’s hatred of life, hefound a motive for such malignity.Nor is the emotional plague confined to one special character type, even thoughsome are more inclined to it than others. We all have our emotional plague impulses, as weall have our T-bacilli. There was no point Reich emphasized more adamantly than people’sresponsibility to recognize these impulses and to take measures to limit their destructivefallout.Much can be said in criticism of Reich’s writings on the little man and on theemotional plague. He was often self-justifying and punitively blamed others. He often usedthe term “emotional plague” to dismiss behavior he himself did not like, even though hewarned against the danger of the term’s becoming a cliché or curse word.However, in my view these writings are among Reich’s most profound statementson the human condition. He has moved—as he always wished to do—from diagnosingpatients to diagnosing humanity. As I have suggested, his diagnoses of the little man andof the emotional plague are free of his earlier romanticization of “the masses” or his con-finement ofdestructiveness to the capitalist class, the Church, or a given political party.The very sweep of the illness made “treatment” difficult. Reich had hit upon somethinglike “original sin,” except that although the sin went deep it was still not original. He lostfaith in everything but the eventual triumph of unarmored life. In his descriptions of thelittle man, the emotional plague, and bio-energetic health, as well as the embryonic delin-eation of their interactions, Reich left a social legacy we shall be developing for a longtime.Stylistically, even though Reich was at times self-indulgent and given to repeti-tious verbal tantrums, he was taking an enormous step forward here and in many of hisother writings during this late phase.His prose had become very direct, hard-hitting, andclear. He had come to feel as Thoreau did about much scientific writing:“I look over the reports of the doings of a scientific associa-tion and am surprised that there is so little life to be reported: I am put off with a parcelofdry technical terms.Anything living is easily and naturally expressed in popular lan-guage... . These learned professors communicate no fact which rises to the temperature ofblood heat. It doesn’t all amount to one rhyme.”From about the mid-forties on, Reich was writing at “the temperature of bloodheat” or higher. This was no accident, but—again—one of his carefully thought-throughdecisions.So much writing seemed to him more than ever an evasion of the essential.“Always use the sharper phrase!” he would exhort, when I was translating some of his ear-lier articles. “Don’t remove my climaxes!” was another refrain. His determination “to behimselfwas now more manifest than ever, in his work, in his personal relations, and in hisprose.23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950303éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Educational DevelopmentsIn addition to the connection between Reich’s psychiatric and social thinking, therewas a close linkage between his psychiatric and educational work. In his preventive effortsduring the late 1920s and early 1930s, Reich had tried to find ways to affirm genitality in chil-dren and adolescents, thereby helping to prevent neuroses. As his psychiatric work focusedon pregenital issues, so his educational interest was drawn to problems of infancy and earlychildhood. Just as in therapy Reich was now concentrating on release of emotions and noton ideas, fantasies, or the content of experiences, so in education his attention now becameriveted by how the flow of feeling had come to be blocked in the first place and how thisblockage might be prevented.Reich’s observations and concepts regarding the infant’s emotional life can best beseen through his experiences with his own son, Peter, who was born in 1944. Reich wroteup his observations of Peter’s infancy in an article stimulated by an attack of “falling anxi-ety” Peter experienced at three weeks of age. Before dealing with the specific symptom offalling anxiety, Reich discussed some general characteristics of neonatal life. During Peter’sfirst days, Reich was impressed by how baffling the infant’s emotional expression was: “[Theinfant] possesses only one form ofexpressing needs, that is, crying. This one form coversinnumerable small and great needs, from the pressure of a diaper crease to colic.”25He noted that in the infant, “the pre-eminent place of contact is the bio-energeti-cally highly charged mouth and throat. If, now, the mother’s nipple reacts to the suckingmovements in the proper biophysical manner with pleasurable sensations, it becomes vigor-ously erect, and the orgonotic excitation of the nipple combines into a unit with that of theinfant’s mouth.”26One of the most striking early observations Reich made of Peter was that of his“oral orgasm”: “At the age of two weeks, the infant had his first orgastic excitation of themouth region.This occurred while he was nursing; the eyeballs turned upwards and side-ways,the mouth began to tremble as did the tongue; the contractions spread over the wholeface;they took about ten seconds,after which the musculature of the face relaxed,”27Reich’s attention was drawn precisely to the energetic features of infancy. Thefusion or energetic contact he detected between the erect nipple of the healthy mother andthe bio-energetically,highly charged mouth of the infant was the same kind effusion he hadalready noted in the adult heterosexual act and in the lumination of two bions betweenwhich a “radiating bridge” is formed.Reich noticed no particular disturbance in Peter until his first oral orgasm. Then theinfant began to cry a great deal, and the people around him were unable to understand thecrying. “I often had the impression that the child wanted something definitebut I did not knowwhat.Only two weeks later did I understand that what he wanted was bodily contact”28The increased crying of the second week foreshadowed a more specific symptom:an acute “falling anxiety” at the end of the third week. It occurred when the baby was takenout ofthe bath and put on his back on the table. It was not immediately clear whether theMyron SharafFury On Earth304éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"motion of laying him down had been too fast, or whether the cooling of the skin had pre-cipitated the falling anxiety. At any rate, the child began to cry violently, pulled back his armsas if to gain support, tried to bring his head forward, showed intense anxiety in his eyes, andcould not be calmed down.Reich was puzzled as to the source of the falling anxiety in an infant. He had longnoted the fear of falling that occurred in adult patients when orgasm anxiety appeared; how-ever, an infant could not be experiencing orgasm anxiety. Nor would it be a rational fear offalling, for an infant lacked any concept of “high” or “low.” Nor in the absence of wordsand ideas could there be a phobia.Reich reasoned that Peter’s falling anxiety represented a “sudden withdrawal of thebiological energy to the biophysical center.”29The withdrawal of energy to the center lefta depletion at the extremities; hence the loss of the feeling of equilibrium.Reich traced the falling anxiety attack to the fact that for a period of about twoweeks the orgonotic contact between mother and baby was poor; apparently the baby hadstrong impulses toward contact which remained ungratified. “Then occurred the orgasm ofthe mouth region, in other words, a perfectly natural discharge took place of the high-pitched excitation of the head and throat region. This increased the need for contact evenfurther.The lack of contact led to a contraction, to a withdrawal of biological energy as aresult of unsuccessful attempts to establish contact.”30Reich utilized his skills as a therapist in dealing with Peter’s falling anxiety. He notedthat the infant’s right shoulderblade and the right arm were pulled back and less mobile thanthe left arm. There was a definite contraction in the musculature of the right shoulder. Theconnection between this contraction and the falling anxiety was clear: during the anxietyattack, the child had pulled back both shoulders, as if to gain a hold. This muscular attitudepersisted even in periods free of anxiety.The therapeutic steps he took with Peter provided the essential principles uponwhich his later work with other infants was based.These steps can be briefly summarized:First,the child was picked up and held when he cried.Second, the shoulders were brought gently forward out of their backward fixationin order to eliminate the incipient armoring ofthe shoulders. Playfully, with laughter andsounds which the baby loved, Reich moved both shoulders forward. This was done daily forabout two months, always in a playful manner.And third, Reich had the child “fall” in order to accustom him to the sensation offalling. Reich would lift him by the armpits and then lower him, slowly at first, then increas-ingly quickly. At first, the child reacted with crying, but soon he began to enjoy it; he wouldlean against Reich’s chest and seemed to want to crawl up on him. On top of Reich’s head,he would squeal with pleasure. In the ensuing weeks, the “climbing up” and “falling” becamea favorite game.The falling anxiety disappeared three weeks after Reich began his treatment. Nordid it appear over the next six months, at which time Reich wrote up his experiences withPeter.23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950305éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Reich noted other aspects of infancy. He began to see that the aliveness of the new-born requires aliveness of the environment:I mean aliveness not only in the expressive language of the adult, butmovement in the strict sense of the word. The infant prefers alive colors to dullones, and moving objects to stationary ones. If the infant is placed in a higher posi-tion so that the walls of the carriage do not obstruct the view and if one removesthe roof, the infant can observe his environment; he will show glowing interest inpeople who pass by, in trees, shrubs, posts, walls, etc.31Several years later, Reich would also emphasize the importance of the infant’s eyecontact with its mother. “The eyes, those silent tongues of love (Cervantes) played as impor-tant a role between mother and infant as between lovers.” However, whereas one couldarrange vivid colors for the infant to see, in spite of one’s own emotional state, one cannot“arrange” a lively visual contact between mother and child. If the mother has a hostile ordull look, the infant will fail to respond with full contact. It may “turn away” figurativelyfrom such contact altogether, “blanking out” with its eyes, for example. Here was rooted thearmoring ofthe eyes Reich had noted so vividly in the case history of schizophrenia.Reich’s experience with Peter led him to opposite concept of a “withdrawn” autis-tic infant, although he emphasized that infants would withdraw if they met false “baby talk”or strict, distant expressions. “It is possible to evoke in an infant of a few weeks vivid pleas-ure and lively response if one talks to him in his guttural sounds, if one makes hismotions,if one has, above all, a lively contact oneself.”32I have summarized Reich’s paper on infancy in some detail not only because ofwhat he discovered about infancy per se, but also because it illustrates with unusual clarityhis capacity to integrate the strands of his work. Some of his concepts were:The conceptualization ofPeter’s falling anxiety was informed by, and in turnenriched,Reich’s experiences with adult patients. Both neurotic and cancer patients experi-enced falling anxiety, accompanied by such symptoms as pallor and shocklike states, follow-ing a sharp increase in their capacity for pleasurable excitement. After his experiences withPeter, Reich more fully understood this process from an energetic viewpoint. Falling anxi-ety resulted from a suddencontraction of energy after a strong expansion. The process wassufficiently distinct from the chronic contractions of a rigid armor and sufficiently impor-tant to warrant its own name—anorgonia—which clearly expressed Reich’s evolvingorgonomic framework of thought.Secondly, the absence of pleasurable excitement in the mother had an impact onthe infant. The energetically charged lips that moved out for contact as well as milk oftengot, at best, only the latter. The infant’s pleasurable impulse diminished, the energetic “juici-ness” and suppleness of the oral segment was replaced by “deadness,” dryness, contrac-tion—in short,the armor. Prior to the study of Peter, Reich had to rely on analytic recon-struction in tracing adult oral symptoms such as “speech disturbances, emptiness of emo-Myron SharafFury On Earth306éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"tional expression, eating disturbances, and fear of kissing” to the infant’s experiences withhis mother. Now he was able to begin to connect these adult phenomena with the in vivostudy of the mother-infant relationship, even though he had but one example.Third, on the negative side, Reich’s emphasis on the importance of orgonotic con-tact between mother and infant contributed to guilt feelings on the part of mothers whosubscribed to his concepts but who had difficulties establishing this kind of contact. Thereis no easy answer to this dilemma. What Reich stressed about the mother-infant relationshipis of great significance even if the optimal experience is—like orgastic potency betweenlovers—quite rare. At the same time, Reich can be faulted for his tendency to picture“orgonotic contact” as an all-or-nothing phenomenon rather than one of degree, and forinsufficiently emphasizing that parental guilt feelings often make matters worse.Fourth, in the oral orgasm Reich delineated once again the orgasm formula: ten-sion-charge-discharge-relaxation. When we combine this observation with Reich’s noting, tobe described soon, the “orgasm reflex” in children starting with the genital phase, then wecan see how he connected one or another form of the orgasm with the entire life cycle. Itwas Reich’s energetic-emotional paradigm which permitted him to assert that the phenom-ena he observed, such as the turning upward and sideways of the eyes and the trembling ofthe mouth,did indeed constitute a kind oforgasm.He could so easily have interpreted it asan attack of gas, if not a minor epileptic seizure. * Fifth, in the handling of Peter’s falling anxiety, Reich innovated a kind of “play ther-apy,” one derived from his long work with the bodily and emotional expression of adultsand closely related to the energy functions he was studying in many different realms.Moreover, the kind of therapy he evolved was ideally suited for working with infants. Unlikethe usual play therapy, it did not even require that the “patient” act out his fantasies in playand activities. It did not require any understanding of interpretations. All that Reich did waswork directly with the emotional expression and the flow of energy through contact, body“games,” and muscle movement.The Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC)Apart from his experiences with Peter, Reich did not work directly with infants andchildren during most of the 1940s. However, he remained deeply concerned with education23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950307éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Indeed, in 1981 a mother who was interested in Reich’s work wrote an article on the upbringing of her childrenand commented:“I believe both children had oral orgasms. ... At first, it was startling and we were afraid our sonmight be ill,but otherwise he didn’t seem sick at all.After it had happened a few times, we thought it was proba-bly nothing to worry about” Mary Vahkup, “Raising Two Children,”Offshoots ofOrgonomy,2,1981, 23.Two mothers interested in Reich’s work told me of very similar reactions to oral orgasms in their infants. However,apart from these three communications, I have read or heard nothing about the oral orgasm since Reich’s publica-tion in 1945. If this relatively common phenomenon, however interpreted, has been so ignored, and, when noticed,so disquieting even to those familiar with Reich’s work, his explanation of the fear-filled avoidance ofallmanifes-tations of orgonotic pulsation becomes more plausible."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"and trained many teachers. One of his students, Lucille Denison, ran a nursery school basedon Reich’s principles for about a year. Various controversies with educational officials andinternal difficulties led to its demise. It was the kind of undertaking Reich yearned for, butfew of his students were able to carry through on their own as Neill had done. It was notuntil December 1949 that Reich developed an organizational plan for studying infants andchildren. At the time, he was deeply immersed in studying orgone energy in the atmosphere.As he wrote to Neill in January 1950:As I pondered over the problem whether to stay in Maine or return toNew York, I felt that I would not be able to produce a single orgonometric thought[mathematics of orgone energy] if I were to discontinue my work on the humanstructure. And I returned to New York at the end of November and swiftly chosefrom a list of about 120 physicians, educators, nurses, social workers, psychologists, etc., about40 people of the best suited and began to establish an Orgonomic Infant ResearchCenter for the study of health and not of sickness. We must finally get away frompathology and start our work with the healthy child33.Much as Reich often deplored the distraction from natural-scientific work whichtherapy represented, he also felt a strong need to continue therapy to maintain his scientif-ic zest. The plan to work with infants and children kept the human connection at the sametime that it allowed him to focus on the study of energy in its natural state.Most of the observations sketched in Reich’s brief but packed comments on Peter’sinfancy were contained in the design for the new Orgonomic Infant Research Center, orOIRC. Special focus was to be put on the prenatal care of mothers; supervision of the deliv-ery and the first few days of the newborn’s life; and prevention of armoring during the firstfive or six years oflife34.Reich’s way of studying infants more systematically was characteristic of his entireapproach to research. He started with very strongly held hypotheses, hypotheses that werein fact stated as findings.For example, he believed, on the basis of little evidence, thatinfants of emotionally healthy mothers had a better intrauterine environment than infantsof less healthy mothers.When it came to a more detailed study of prenatal and postnatal development,Reich allowed for the possibility that he might be wrong. Thus, he included in his researchdesign children from two groups of mothers: relatively healthy mothers (group A) and basi-cally sound but somewhat more problematic mothers (group B). He was interested in not-ing the differences, if any, in the children from the two groups.This scientific procedure created certain unanticipated problems. Some group Amothers went around boasting that they were “healthy”; some group B mothers felt thatthey had been labeled defective. Reich blamed others for these misperceptions, for makingan ideal of the “perfect” mother. But his own writings, as mentioned earlier, contributed toMyron SharafFury On Earth308éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"the very situation he deplored.With the assistance of a social worker, Grethe Hoff, and several orgonomic physi-cians, Reich proceeded in a very careful way. The plan was to follow the research subjectsfrom early in pregnancy and the infants from their very first moments of life into adoles-cence. In selecting mothers for the OIRC, Reich examined them psychiatrically to assess thedegree and kind of armoring. He also interviewed the husbands. In the initial discussionswith the prospective parents, he was particularly interested in exploring their ability to resistfamilial pressure for circumcision or other destructive practices in child raising. I would alsonote that Reich was always very careful to deal with the issue of what is now called“informed consent” from research subjects. In general, he would let everyone—frompatients undergoing therapy, to assistants in scientific experiments, to parents in the OIRCknow as fully and honestly as the could about the possible risks as well as benefits (both per-sonally and in terms of scientific knowledge) involved in their participation.Reich also informed the parents about various alternatives for delivery and elicitedtheir own views on these. For physical reasons, he stressed, hospitals were safer than homedelivery, but emotionally it was of great importance for the baby to be with the mother rightafter birth, something most hospitals did not permit at that time. Most parents elected tohave the delivery in hospitals where they could sometimes with great difficulty modify rou-tine procedures.Reich was ahead of his time in urging extreme caution about the use of medica-tions during pregnancy since he was concerned about their possible effect on the embryo.The times have caught up with him in this respect, but not with regard to his advice thatpregnant mothers use the orgone accumulator.Reich hypothesized that the very act of carrying the embryo had an energetic effecton the mother. As he once put it: “The fetus acts like a stove; it is another energy system inthe mother and it energizes the mother’s whole being.”35In one case, it could enhance themother’s genitality; in another, it could decrease it out of anxiety from the rise in the bio-energetic level.Reich was extremely critical of various obstetrical practices at the time of birth thatwere considered routine during the 19405 though many are now being opposed. Some ofthese practices were drugs to induce birth, particularly when such induction was based onthe doctor’s convenience; heavy sedation for the mother during labor when the need for itwas not clearly indicated; unnecessary use of forceps; and routine episiotomies.To assist mothers in not requiring heavy medication, the OIRC tried to have anorgone therapist in attendance at birth in order to help the mother breathe and relax.Chester M.Raphael, a physician who worked with Reich, has well described how useful atherapist can be in the delivery room.The first mother he attended had been in labor for more than forty hours:Her condition seemed desperate.I found her sitting up supporting herselfwith her arms held rigidly against the sides of the bed, her face ashen, her lips cyan-23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950309éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"otic, her pulse thready, her hands cold and clammy, her shoulders hunched upacutely Between contractions, her eyes rolled up into her head and her distress wasextreme with each contraction... .It took considerable effort to make her lower her shoulders.

The severity of the pain of uterine con-tractions began to subside... . Despite more than forty hours in labor, a good partof it agonizingly painful, she began to look comfortable and pleased. An importantquality of her reaction to pain was a distinct withdrawal in her eyes. When she didthis, she appeared to lose all contact. She did not hear me, seemed confused, and itwas difficult to bring her back.The mother herself reported later: “Only when you called me back would I, with avery definite effort, bring my gaze back. It was so easy to go off that I believe you had tocall me back quite often. By this time I was tingling all over. I began to feel warm andrelaxed,whereas previously I was chilled and tense. ... I can’t quite understand it myself. Ionly know that it helped me tremendously.”36Beyond the elimination of harmful neonatal procedures, Reich very early practicedcertain kinds of intervention, or what he came to call “emotional first aid,” with infants andchildren. Thus, one infant, the son of an orgone therapist and a mother very interested inReich’s work, developed an illness soon after birth. For reasons not too clear the infant boyhad been circumcised. Reich, who saw the infant soon after birth, described him as round-ed like a “bluish balloon.” His chest was high and respiration was disturbed. An angry crybroke out as though the organism wanted to get out of itself. The penis was cyanotic. Thebaby had been crying almost constantly and jumped at the slightest touch. It was like a chainofevents where one link pulled the other.Reich advised stopping all enemas and all chemical treatments. The baby had to begiven considerable warmth. Finally, the blown-up chest had to be eliminated. How does onework with a baby’s chest? One can’t go in with the knuckles or tell the baby to breathe. Reichtried to help him breathe by gently tickling and swinging him. Gentle massage was also used.Reich helped the mother to learn the same techniques; she also proceeded to stroke the restof the child’s body. And the parents tried to help the infant gag.Some months later, the child was much improved and his movements were moregentle.37Reich’s intervention here clearly illustrated several of his principles. First, he mod-ified techniques derived from the study of heavily armored adults to handle more acute con-tractions and armorings in an infant, contractions that in an adult would take longer torelease.Second,he brought the mother into the treatment. Once again he was searching forways to make his endeavors more practical socially. Much as he believed that only a physi-Myron SharafFury On Earth310éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"cian should treat severe emotional disorders, he also believed that others could apply “emo-tional first aid” in less severe disorders. As Reich put it: “Only healthy and right structurescan do the right thing. What made it here was the ability of the mother to give love. Themother must have contact with the child before anything else can happen.”Reich distinguished between three kinds of mothers in terms of emotional inter-ventions: those who easily learned first-aid techniques; those who could but who were afraidand who needed support; and those who were too sick to learn them.Here again we perceive the continuity in all Reich’s social efforts. He was most con-cerned about the second kind of persons—adolescents, mothers, or whoever—who couldreach out and function in a much healthier way ifthey received support. This was the swinggroup, so to speak. There were relatively few in the first or healthy group, and the thirdrequired lengthy therapy before they could be useful.Although Reich’s primary aim for the OIRC was the study of health in the prena-tal, postnatal, childhood, and adolescent periods, and active intervention, not long-termtreatment, in any acute difficulties, he also had a secondary broad social aim. He assessed thepotential contributions of persons connected with the OIRC. A sociologist could make astudy of legal difficulties and implications regarding the newborn. An orgone therapist whohad formerly been an obstetrician could locate hospitals receptive to more flexible proce-dures and might also be willing to do home deliveries. An orgonomically oriented internistcould study the existing hospital conditions as they pertained to the newborn. A mothercould observe the oral orgasm in infants and a nursery-school teacher the orgasm reflex inchildren.Reich believed that when children entered the genital phase, they were capable notonly of genital excitation but also of a convulsive discharge of excitation. The excitation didnot reach a sharp peak, followed by a rapid discharge of excitation, as it did in adults; therewas no climax. The rise and fall of excitation was more gradual.It is interesting—and sad—to note that after some thirty-five years we know littlemore about the orgasm reflex in children than what Reich described.The OIRC functioned actively for only a few years. All in all, Reich studied closelyabout twelve mothers and their offspring;in addition, he consulted on about a dozen casesofolder children with various problems. At its height an OIRC social worker, Grethe Hoff,worked half-time for Reich, following the mothers during pregnancy and the mothers andinfants during the first weeks and months of their lives. In addition, several therapists werevery active in consultation.After early 1952,under the pressure ofother events we shall soon discuss, Reichspent little time with the OIRC. Like so many of his undertakings, it had a short, vivid life.Out of it he culled not only important concepts but a number of very specific techniques.When one reads of Reich’s achievements in summary form, much of what he says seems sosimple and obvious.It is easy to overlook the fact that no one in his time was seeing anddoing what he was seeing and doing.23 : Psychiatric, Sociological, and Educational Developments: 1940-1950311éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Today, Reich’s work with infants and children is not so much represented by anyorganization that bears his name as it is by a myriad of workers, some of whom are famil-iar with his research, many of whom are not.

Other of hisemphases, for example that on natural childbirth, were and are advanced by many others.However, he provides a unified theoretical framework not available in the work of thosewho may advance particular approaches identical with or similar to him. It is important thatthe distinctive quality of his research should be constantly noted, as the Journal of Orgonomydoes so well. It is equally important that his work should be connected with the broad sweepof our century’s progressive educational development, a development he both influencedand reflected.Myron SharafFury On Earth312éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950Once established in America, Reich entered a period of quiet work and living dom-inated by scientific research. He was able to find and purchase his own home in late 1941,for Ilse and he had had trouble with the house they rented in Forest Hills. To quote Ilse:They [the neighbors] objected to our letting the hedge around the housegrow high; they objected to our having a Negro assistant, a young biology studentwho studied for a while with Reich and, of course, shared our meals; they object-ed to the “rats” in our basement and they transmitted these complaints to our land-lord. He sent an investigator who could find no reason for the complaints and wasvery much surprised to find our mice confined to securely closed boxes neatlyarranged on shelves However, we felt our privacy invaded by our particular neigh-bor who continued to observe our every move, and we did not want to live at themercy of a landlord’s whim1.In the fall of 1941, Reich bought a home at 99-06 69th Avenue, a block from theForest Hills Tennis Stadium. Here he was to spend eight to ten months a year, the summerperiod in Maine being expanded as the years progressed. The basic pattern of his life wasestablished, not to be altered until his full-time move to Rangeley in 1950.Ilse provides a picture of how thoroughly their home life was dominated by work:“The large basement with a separate laundry room was ideal for laboratory purposes andhad a separate entrance. The rooms in the house were larger than in the old one. Reich couldhave his library in his study, out of the way of the laboratory and the various householdactivities.As before, the dining room was used for electroscopy, and later on for X-ray work.The living room became a combination waiting room, office, and dining room.”2The Forest Hills home was the center of Reich’s therapeutic and organizationalactivities from 1942 until 1950, just as the Maine home was the center for his scientificresearch.However, considerable research also went on at Forest Hills. Here Reich was con-stantly bothered by having to switch from writing and research to seeing patients. It was notuntil he moved to Maine year round that this particular problem was resolved.The period in his life between 1942 and 1945 was outwardly quiet. Many personscame for therapy, including a number of teachers and social workers. But he had few col-leagues,Wolfe continuing to be his chief co-worker. His relationship with Ilse centeredheavily upon work.313éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"The emotional connection between them during this period is more obscure. In herthirties now, Ilse was eager to have a child. Initially, Reich was not. When Ilse did becomepregnant, Reich insisted on an abortion3. (We recall that in the mid-1930s he had insistedthat Elsa Lindenberg have an abortion.) Much as Reich loved children, he was not one to letaccident, or his mate’s wishes, dictate his destiny. With Ilse he may have felt continuinguncertainties about the relationship itself. Also, the heavy pressure of his work may havemade him feel the time was not ripe for a child.It is hard to overestimate Reich’s commitment to work during these years. With thediscovery of orgone energy, a long-held sense of mission was intensified. Even inScandinavia, there had still been time for fun—skiing, tennis, and parties. In America therewas no skiing, no tennis, no parties. Diversions were limited to such activities as a Sundaytrip—with Ilse and his daughters—to Jones Beach, or to dinner and a movie with Ilse.The closest thing Reich had to a friendship during those years was his relationshipby mail with A. S. Neill in England4. Neill’s independence, strong sense of personal iden-tity, and achievements, combined with his deep respect for Reich, permitted the two men arelationship nearer to equality than Reich was to have with anyone else. But even with Neill,Reich’s letters are almost totally devoted to work. The frequent references to social problemswere part of Reich’s work, since he never lost the sense of himself as a socially engagedresearcher, with the deep conviction that his ideas had many answers to the turmoil then rag-ing. Reich hardly ever wrote to Neill about his personal life—his relationship with Ilse or hisfeelings toward co-workers and students other than his evaluation of them as workers.Personal joys and complaints rarely entered the correspondence.Yet the letters convey more of a sense of the man than some of his communica-tions. And one feels his love for Neill, just as Neill’s letters convey his love for Reich.Typically with Reich, his letters are especially directed to themes of concern to the recipientas well as himself. With Neill, the shared concerns were education and social-political devel-opments.Occasionally,he confided in Neill about something quite beyond Neill’s ken, suchas the encounter with Einstein,simply because there were so few people with whom hecould discuss such events.Despite the relative absence of attacks on his work, memories of old ones couldstill stir in Reich the kind of rage that provoked his own authoritarian tendencies. This ten-dency was to reach a crescendo in the 19508, but it could clearly be seen in a relatively minorincident from the early 1940s.In 1942 Gunnar Leistikow, a Norwegian journalist, had written an article on theNorwegian newspaper campaign for the International Journal for SexEconomy and Orgone-Research5. Leistikow protested certain editorial changes made in his article without his per-mission,the most important of which was the title Wolfe chose, “The Fascist NewspaperCampaign in Norway.”Leistikow’s original article did not contain the word “Fascist.” Afterthe article appeared, he wrote Wolfe that it was highly misleading to label the campaign“Fascist”when in fact a Socialist newspaper had been in the forefront of the attack. Inresponse,Wolfe wrote that the sex-economic definition of fascism had nothing to do withMyron SharafFury On Earth314éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"party membership, nationality, or class. But an author’s title had been changed in a drasticway without his permission. It would seem clear that Wolfe made this change at Reich’s insti-gation. Reich, usually so scrupulous in respecting an author’s intention, in this instance fla-grantly violated his own policy. The trigger was evident: his rage at the newspapers that hadslandered his work in Norway.If particular interactions could stir old resentments, they could also stir old hopes.Alexander Lowen has told me that around 1943 he knew staff members of the SettlementHouse connected with the Union Theological Seminary in New York City6. He arranged for Reich, who he then thought “couldchange the world,” to speak before the staff of the House. Reich proposed a plan wherebyhe would give talks at the House for the staff and youth on sexual problems and their socialconnections—in short, an effort along earlier sex-political lines but without the Marxist, rev-olutionary perspective. As at the earlier sex-counseling centers, Reich, Wolfe, and a few oth-ers would also offer sex counseling free of charge for adolescents connected with the Housewho wished this opportunity.According to Lowen, Reich spoke superbly and the staff greeted the plan enthusi-astically. However, the board of the House vetoed the proposal. Like his scientific overturesto Einstein,Reich’s social initiative was dashed after what looked like a promising beginning.Never again would he make this kind of social effort.By 1943, Reich had changed his mind, and was eager to become a father again. Thebirth of his son Peter on April 4, 1944, was a tremendously joyful event, which he sharedwith Neill. Reich’s personal delight in having a baby boy blended inextricably with his scien-tific sense of wonder. For, as noted earlier, the birth of Peter gave a tremendous spur toReich’s long-standing interest in the newborn.Peter added a new and stabilizing dimension to Reich and Ilse’s relationship. For allhis dislike of compulsive monogamy and whatever his problems with Ilse, part of Reich wasdefinitely a family man. He enjoyed doing things with his family. And he loved his son. Hewas undoubtedly eager not to make some ofthe same mistakes with Peter he had made withEva and Lore, They had been put on a rigid feeding schedule; with Peter, everything wasdone in accordance with the principles ofself-regulation and of orgonomy7.Reich’s interest in Peter does not imply that he was the kind of husband who“shared” child-caring responsibilities with his wife. As Reich once wrote to Neill, he was agreat child lover but a poor child caretaker. Ilse has related the anecdote of how Reich verygenerously told her to take some time off and go fishing, only to call her in a panic whenPeter needed to have his diapers changed.For all Reich’s emphasis on the importance of the mother-infant relationship, hewas keen for Ilse to have considerable time to work for him. At some point in Peter’s firstyear the Reichs employed a full-time maid, which relieved Ilse of many daily chores withboth the home and the child, but enabled her still to have time with Peter. In my dealingswith the Reichs I was always impressed by how Peter was fitted into the daily schedule sothat he received considerable attention as work continued.24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950315éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Peter’s integration into the busy home life reflected Ilse’s ability to handle a greatvariety of tasks with remarkable “grace under pressure.” She exuded a calm, unpretentiousserenity that provided a fine grounding for Reich’s volatility. At a deeper level, the relation-ship remained more problematic. As noted, Ilse was never in therapy, although almost every-one else involved in Reich’s work had been or was in treatment. Partly, Reich was relievedthat Ilse was not preoccupied by her own emotional problems. When students raised thequestion of why she had not been in therapy—the kind of personal question one could raisewith Reich in the context of the relative safety of a treatment session—he would reply impa-tiently that she did not need it. But Ilse had trouble getting close to people. This kind of psy-chological distance bothered Reich, and he would frequently erupt over one or another ofits manifestations. Reich also continued his practice of acting out on those around him thefrustrations he felt from other sources.Reich and Ilse did not marry legally until April 17, 1945, when Peter was a little overa year old. Reich retained his animus against legal marriage; he decided to take this step onthe advice of their lawyer, Arthur Garfield Hays, who warned that they would not be ableto pass the naturalization hearings as they planned unless they were married8. It was a civilceremony with strangers as witnesses. The wedding was unadorned because Reich and Ilseinitially intended to get a legal divorce as soon as they both became U.S. citizens. Ilse sailedthrough her naturalization hearings in November 1945. After a much longer but friendlyhearing, Reich became an American citizen on May 28, 1946. For reasons not entirely clear,they relinquished the initial plan to get an immediate divorce.While Ilse was visiting her mother and brother in England during April-May 1947,Reich had a brief affair9. (He may well have had other affairs during the 1940s but there isno record of them, and, indeed, no gossip about this one. Reich successfully kept a very tightlid on his personal life.) Characteristically, he went into a jealous rage when Ilse returnedfrom England, interrogating her mercilessly about her fidelity to him during her vacation.Reich had shown such pathological jealousy once before when he was detained on EllisIsland.Typically, this second outburst occurred after a vicious article against his work—thefirst of its kind in America—was published in May 1947 in The New Republic(to be describedin Chapter 25).Reich’s relationship with Eva and Lore remained problematical. While she was acollege student in the early 1940s, Eva visited fairly often. At one point, Reich had hopedshe might come and live with him; he kept a room available for her, but she was still toomuch torn between her parents to accept this offer. She moved closer to her father in thesecond halfofthe 19405,when she was attending medical school. Her interest in his workgrew steadily but was accompanied by considerable anxiety. Eva recalls being surprised tohear a student of Reich’s talk very glowingly about him—she was not used to hearing herfather referred to in this way10.Reich remained eager to win her over completely as adaughter and a student. When she visited in Maine, I noted with some surprise his beingupset that she “did not spend more time with him,” a common parental complaint one didnot expect from Reich.Reich contributed to Eva’s medical education, but only very modest-Myron SharafFury On Earth316éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"ly; there were further scenes between Annie and him on this account.Lore’s visits became rarer as the forties progressed. The long-standing alliance ofLore with her mother deepened. In 1948, Lore paid a surprise visit to Reich in Forest Hillsafter years of separation. According to Ilse, Reich had just had a series of painful toothextractions and her visit occurred when his jaw was so swollen he was unable to talk to any-one. He refused to see her, a rejection so total one cannot attribute it solely to his pain,silence, and facial disfigurement. In addition, he had grown to feel that Lore did not belongto his way of life, and once such a decision was made he could be ruthless. Understandably,Lore was deeply hurt and there was practically no further contact between them.Wolfe was the first co-worker to join Reich in spending summers in Maine. Hebought a cabin very near Reich’s so they could have easy access to each other and the oppor-tunity to discuss translations and other matters in a far less hectic atmosphere than NewYork City. At the time Wolfe was living with Jo Jenks, a sensitive, spirited sculptress whosework Reich very much admired. Jo was also a patient of Reich’s—and much in awe of him.Reich’s attitude toward the relationship between Theo, as Wolfe was called by thoseclose to him, and Jo vividly illustrates how important Wolfe was to him. In 1942, Wolfe hada recurrence of his tuberculosis and was invalided for some months. After his recovery,Reich told Jo in a therapeutic session that Wolfe was so valuable to orgonomy he must askher to end the relationship. Jo had three children from a previous marriage, and Wolfe wasnot prepared for that kind of familial burden, Reich maintained; it would interfere with hiswork. Jo, stunned, took up the matter with Theo that night over dinner at a restaurant. Hissilence led her to believe that he concurred with Reich. She left the restaurant abruptly andthe relationship broke off. She maintained her contact with Reich, however, and laterbecame friendly again with Theo11.I have heard this incident only from Jo herself; there may have been mitigating cir-cumstances. On the face of it, Reich’s self-serving directive violated the true therapeuticspirit. It is another frightening example of the lengths he would go to protect his vital inter-ests or,as he would put it,the vital interests oforgonomy.In the summer of1942,it was Jo who discovered the abandoned farm that Reichwould later buy and name “Orgonon” and that would become his scientific base. Located afew miles west ofRangeley village and a few miles east of Mooselookmeguntic Lake, thefarm was part woodland and part meadow. The hill, which Reich thought would be the idealsite for a future observatory, had a beautiful view of the mountains and lakes. There were awell and a spring on the land, and about half a mile of shoreline on Dodge Pond. In 1942,when Reich bought the land, the 280 acres cost about $4,000.Orgonon grew over the years. In 1943, Reich built his first cabin on the land, a one-room structure that provided some isolation for his writing while the family remained at thesmall Mooselookmeguntic cabin. In 1945, he had a laboratory constructed, which couldaccommodate a large number of students who wished to observe the energy phenomena,to learn the Reich Blood Tests, to study the effects of orgone energy application on cancerin mice, and to study protozoa and bions under the microscope. The Students’ Laboratory24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950317éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"had a very large main hall for microscopic work, facilities for biological preparations, amouse room, and a room completely encased with sheet iron, lightproof, and equipped withmany special instruments for the observation of orgone energy. It was a very beautiful placeto work, with large windows overlooking the mountains and lakes, and it was to be the cen-ter of orgonomic conferences, lectures, and courses for many years.In 1946, Reich developed his world at Orgonon still further by building a winter-ized family cabin on the property. This enabled him to stay on in Maine well into the fall inthe atmosphere he loved so dearly.Reich’s most elaborate structure was built in 1948-49: the Observatory. This wasconstructed on top of a high hill, with marvelous views. The Observatory reflected Reich’sgrowing interest in astrophysical studies. Since it was intended to carry a heavy telescope, thefoundation was laid on solid rock. In Listen, Little Man!Reich had used the line: “Build yourlife on rock!” I recall Reich watching the masons laying rocks for the Observatory buildingand saying, “You see, I mean what I wrote: Build your life on rock.”Reich was deeply involved in the actual building process. He watched the progressdaily and admired the workers’ skill. He was especially fascinated by the work of the stone-masons—their almost intuitive knowledge of which stone to place where. The workmen inturn responded to Reich’s keen interest. He treated them as equals, without pretense, andthey appreciated it. He talked with them about their families and children, and to this daysome of them have retained their warmth and loyalty toward him.A few further words should be said about Reich’s relations with the Rangeley work-men. The first important relationship was with Herman Templeton, who had sold him thecabin at Mooselookmeguntic and built the first accumulator. Over and beyond their workrelationship, Reich found in the Maine guide a sympathetic and understanding audience:We had come close to each other when I told him about the nature of thebions.This simple man disclosed a spontaneously acquired knowledge of the liv-ing with which no academic biology or physics can compete. I asked him whetherhe wanted to see the life energy under the microscope. I was flabbergasted whenmy friend,even before looking into the microscope, gave me a correct descriptionofthe bions.For decades,he had been observing the growth of seeds and the char-acter ofthe humus with the unerring instinct of somebody who has always livedclose to nature. There are, he said, very small vesicles (“bubbles”) everywhere.From these, everything develops that is “life.” They were so small, he said, that theycould not be seen with the naked eye. Yet, the moss on the rocks developed fromthem:the rock,always exposed to the weather, “softens up” on the surface andforms these life bubbles. He said he had often tried to talk about this with academ-ic tourists, but had only met with a peculiar smile. Nevertheless, he said, he was surethat he was right. I had to admit that he was right, for how could moss “germs”“strike root”in the rock?12Myron SharafFury On Earth318éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Reich later developed a similar kind of relationship, combining the roles of employ-er, friend, and colleague, with another Rangeley man, Tom Ross. Forty at the time, Rossbecame caretaker of the Orgonon property in 1948. But the word “caretaker” does scantjustice to Ross’s role there. Not only did he keep up the property; he also helped Reich in avariety of ways from constructing different kinds of equipment to participating in experi-ments, and he became a trusted friend. Unlike so many of Reich’s students, who brought totheir relationship with him all kinds of therapeutic expectations, a thirst for knowledge orlove from the marvelous leader, Tom made no such demands. He was doing a job, he likedReich, he was prepared to learn from him; but if things did not work out, he could go else-where without too much sadness, guilt, or anger. Tom was able to perceive many orgonom-ic phenomena, such as the tingling heat of the accumulator when he put his hand close toit. However, when he did not feel or understand something, “I told the doctor that—I did-n’t have much education, I only finished the eighth grade.”Just as in the late 1920s and early 1930s Reich had found that his industrial workerfriends were more in touch with basic social truths than his sophisticated psychoanalytic col-leagues, so in the 19405 he felt that many of his Maine country friends were in touch withnatural-scientific truths that eluded the Einsteins and Oppenheimers. Reich spoke often ofthe need for a response from the environment.He had his own talent for finding it.Such was Rangeley’s charm: the climate, dry and clear; the geography of mountainsand lakes; friends like Templeton and Ross who could to some extent follow Reich’s work;the relatively simple human work relationships that existed in a small rural town and thatclosely fitted Reich’s model of a work democracy; the opportunity for sustained research,uninterrupted by patients and other involvements of his New York existence—all thesemade the Maine summers vastly appealing to Reich. He did everything he could to extendthe length of the Rangeley phase of his yearly schedule, starting with a month in 1940 andbuilding up to about four months by 1949. In May 1950, he began to live at Orgonon on ayear-round basis.Reich had elaborate plans as to how Orgonon would become a center fororgonomic research and education. Few of his hopes came to pass. Over the years, severalcourses and conferences were held at Orgonon for physicians and other students. A hand-ful ofserious researchers spent considerable time there. But as with so many of Reich’splans for group development of his work, his dreams for Orgonon were barely fulfilled.The end ofWorld War II marked the end of Reich’s relative isolation from the psy-chiatric world. Prior to 1946, he had only two therapists working with him, Wolfe andWilliam Thorburn.The latter was an osteopath. Reich had a good opinion of this quiet, gen-tle man’s therapeutic skill, but Thorburn was never close or particularly active in the organi-zational development of orgonomy. Some of the physicians associated with Reich after thewar were to be important.The first was James A.Willie. Willie owned a private psychiatric hospital inOklahoma at the time he read The Function of the Orgasm.13He was suffering a depression in24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950319éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"late 1945, and after reading the book, he decided to seek treatment from Reich. He movedto New York, initially with the idea of staying only as long as his treatment required. Asoften happened in people’s relationships with Reich, Willie got more than he intended: hebecame so involved with orgonomy that he never returned to Oklahoma.A few months after Willie began his treatment, Reich urged him to start seeingpatients. Willie did not feel ready to begin, but Reich prevailed upon him. It was character-istic of Reich that he tended to take it as a sign that someone was ready to start if the per-son felt he was not. Such an attitude indicated a sensitive awareness of the difficulties ratherthan the cocksureness Reich detested.Willie was an independent person, never to be Reich’s yes-man. Difficulties devel-oped in the early 19505, but in the first years Reich had a high opinion of him. One sawReich at his least dictatorial and most accepting in many of his interactions with Willie. Togive a single example: Not long after Willie started psychiatric treatment, Reich urged himto use the accumulator. After Willie had used it a few times, Reich asked him what hethought of it. Willie responded that he had felt nothing in it and that he thought the accu-mulator was “a lot of bullshit.” Reich simply laughed and told him to go on using it. LaterWillie, a red-faced, hypertensive individual, became so charged by the accumulator that hecould not tolerate using it even for a short time.Another physician to study with Reich, starting in 1946, and one who was to be themost important to him in subsequent years, was Elsworth F. Baker. A quiet, modest man,Baker was chief of the Female Service at Marlboro State Hospital in New Jersey at the timehe met Reich. He was also secretary of the New Jersey Medical Society. Like Willie, Bakerwas depressed at the start of treatment, and he began therapy simply with the idea of beinga patient and working on his problems14. Again like Willie, Reich urged him to begin see-ing patients and cautiously to use Reich’s techniques soon after he started treatment. Bakeralso made a considerable effort to become familiar with the totality of Reich’s work, spend-ing time in the laboratory doing microscopic work under the direction of Ilse, and, occa-sionally,Reich himself.By 1948 or so, Baker was part of the informal inner circle that includ-ed Wolfe, Ilse, and Willie.Initially, Baker saw Reich for six months, three times a week. Reich felt Baker couldstop at that point,but the latter insisted on another six months of treatment. At that timeReich wanted to make therapy as short as possible, urging his students to go out on theirown,coming back for additional treatment if necessary. In this respect, his treatment phi-losophy had become similar to Freud’s, who also tended to give relatively brief treatment tomany analystsin-training. Freud considered analysis a lifelong process, a process the treat-ment per se only initiated.Things had come full circle. Now with his concentration onarmoring and energy flow, on prevention rather than treatment, on orgone physics and bio-physics, Reich was impatient with long-term treatment and used a highly modified form ofcharacter analysis in addition to his body techniques.Since Baker was held in high regard by his colleagues at Marlboro State Hospital,his interest in orgonomy stimulated several other staff members. Drs. A. Allan Cott, ChesterMyron SharafFury On Earth320éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"Raphael, and Sidney Handelman each entered treatment with Reich not long after Bakerstarted. Of these new recruits Raphael was to become the most important, participatingactively in cancer studies, the OIRC, and administrative matters. Boyish in appearance,Raphael was very intelligent and often a man of independent judgment but not inclined tocontradict Reich openly.The Reichian Marlboro cohort (which also came to include some nonmedical staff)began to alarm the hospital’s medical director, J. B. Gordon. Gordon spread rumors thatBaker was schizophrenic and that he masturbated his patients. Such was the noxious effectof Reich, for previously Gordon had considered Baker an outstanding psychiatrist. In 1948,Baker, Raphael, a social worker, and a psychologist were personally reprimanded by HenryGotten, Deputy Commissioner of Mental Health for the state of New Jersey15.Cotten’s interview with Baker, et al., covered such topics as whether Reich was in amental hospital, whether Baker masturbated patients, whether patients undergoing orgonetherapy screamed with pain, and what the “orgone box” was.Four weeks later, Gotten committed suicide. The reasons for this act or even its con-nection with Reich are open to doubt. At the time, Reich commented vengefully: “That’s agood way to get rid of the emotional plague.” Suicide, by friend or foe, always had a partic-ular fascination for him, a reaction undoubtedly connected with the suicide of his mother.The war against the Reichians at Marlboro State Hospital continued. Several youngphysicians who had started therapy with Reich were fired. Baker himself had too secure aposition to be dismissed, but the unpleasantness generated by the attacks led him to resignin October 1948. By this time his private practice in orgone therapy had grown to a pointwhere he no longer needed or desired a state position.Another newcomer in 1946 who was to become important to Reich was Simeon J.Tropp. Tropp was a surgeon in New York City at the time he met Reich. During hisAmerican years Reich held the policy, one that Wolfe opposed, of accepting physicians fortraining who had not had prior psychiatric experience. Tropp was among this small group.Reich had hoped that Tropp would be especially active in developing medical orgonomy, forexample,the use of the accumulator in the treatment of various physical illnesses and theshort-term use of psychiatric techniques for certain acute somatic disturbances that had anemotional component.For a few years Tropp did pursue these interests, but eventually hismain concern became the psychiatric treatment of neuroses.Tropp’s special contribution for Reich lay not in any intellectual achievement but inthe personal friendship,approbation, and support he gave him. Tropp had a warm, whimsi-cal personality and was financially more affluent and personally freer than many of the othertherapists. He made many generous contributions to Reich’s work. He was the only thera-pist who moved with Reich to Rangeley in 1950 and had frequent contact with him in theremaining years. But much as Reich liked him, Tropp’s lack of intellectual discipline ledReich to hold him in distrust as well as affection.Other therapists to join Reich in the late 1940s were Oscar Tropp (Simeon’s broth-er), Victor Sobey from the Veterans’ Hospital, Philip Gold, Charles Oiler, Morton24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950321éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Herskowitz (like Thorburn, an osteopath), Emanuel Levine (later killed in an auto accident),and Michael Silvert, a psychiatrist-intraining at the Menninger Clinic in Kansas. All of thesephysicians would remain committed to orgonomy and helpful to Reich until the end of hislife, but only Silvert was to play an important role in later years.With some exceptions, the American therapists were less outstanding and accom-plished far less than his Viennese, Berlin, or Oslo students. Reich’s work had grown morecontroversial; few physicians were prepared to take the ridicule and ostracism that accom-panied allegiance to orgonomy. Of those who did, Helena Deutsch’s description of Freud’searly students is pertinent:One might ... expect these first pupils to have been revolutionaries of thespirit ... a select and courageous advance guard. Such an expectation could be real-ized only in individual instances... . Many were impelled by their own neuroses ... orby identification of their lack of recognition with Freud’s lot... . The objective truthof Freud’s researches was of less importance than the gratification of the emotion-al need to be esteemed and appreciated by him...16.It says something about the lack of creativity or the blocks to independent produc-tivity among the physicians who studied with Reich that only a few of them were able towrite about and teach orgonomy after Reich’s death.Physicians attracted to orgonomy may not have been especially creative, but at leastthey could earn a good living. Many people seeking therapy from Reich were referred to hisstudents—another aspect of his power. However, researchers interested in the field oforgonomy lacked any practical means of supporting themselves, for Reich, generally, couldnot find the funds to pay salaries. Nor was there any hope of grants from the governmentor support from universities. Three of these researchers had to pursue orgonomy in theirspare time: Bernard Grad, Ph.D., a biologist from McGill University; Sol Kramer, Ph.D., anentomologist from the University ofWisconsin; and Helen MacDonald, Ph.D., a biologistfrom the University of California. These talented and devoted people became acquaintedwith Reich’s work in the late 1940s and studied with him during summers at Orgonon. Otherresearchers, more tentatively interested, did not follow through, usually because of sharp dif-ferences between their traditional outlook and Reich’s approach.For his part,Reich was glad to have well-trained physicians and scientists join hiswork. He yearned for the scientific and social acceptance of orgonomy; he also wanted morecontact with people who understood what he was doing. However, he would sometimesbehave as ifsuch acceptance were of little moment to him. Baker has reported the follow-ing exchange during his therapy:Reich asked me if I thought he was glad that I had come to him. ... I said yes, Ithought he was, because I was a classical physician, a Freudian analyst, and secretary of amedical society I mentioned also that I was responsible for five other physicians becominginterested in his work. Reich let go with a full salvo and gave me to understand that it wasMyron SharafFury On Earth322éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"unimportant to him whether I had coine or not. He said he didn’t need me or anyone else17.The Reich who “didn’t need me or anyone else” was part of the stern personaadopted soon after arrival in America. However, it was not simply a mask. Reich was con-vinced that he was orgonomy’s main asset and that no one was going to hinder his progress.He was a more overwhelming leader than he had been in Europe. Although he remained agenerous and stimulating teacher to the end, his chief interest now lay in a relentless pursuitof his own destiny. Others were secondary, to be sacrificed when they interfered with hiscreativity. It was no facile warning he gave one student: “Keep away from me. I am over-whelming. I burn through people.”18In America, Reich was able to attract a number of intellectuals who did not actual-ly work with him, but who were much influenced by his teachings. The artist closest to himwas William Steig, who illustrated Listen, Little Man!Steig was one of the few persons whocame to Reich with an independent, successful career. His contributions to The New Yorkerand his books had already made him one of America’s most innovative cartoonists. He wasalso a charming, witty person with a feeling for the nuances of life. A patient of Reich’s inthe mid-i94os, he was deeply grateful for the help he received, and believed the accumulatorhad saved his mother’s life. He was totally committed to Reich, and in the 19508 he wouldwork hard on Reich’s behalf.Paul Goodman, poet, essayist, philosopher, psychologist, and man of letters, was intherapy with Alexander Lowen around I94519. After Goodman wrote the first positivereview of Reich’s work to appear in America, Reich telephoned him and asked Goodman tocome and speak with him20.Excited at the prospect of working with Reich, Goodman wasdisappointed when at the meeting Reich expressed displeasure over Goodman’s linkage oforgonomy with anarchism.He asked Goodman to cease making this connection. In his turn,Goodman pointed out similarities between the concept of work democracy and the ideas ofPeter Kropotkin,a noted Russian philosopher ofanarchism. Goodman was touched byReich’s frank, embarrassed acknowledgment that he was not familiar with Kropotkin. But hewas chagrined by Reich’s authoritarianism. His annoyance did not prevent him from contin-uing to be a persuasive advocate of many of Reich’s psychological and social concepts, how-ever, although he was never involved in the natural-scientific side of orgonomy.Saul Bellow, the distinguished novelist, was in therapy with one of Reich’s studentsin the 1940s and for a period was so devoted to Reich’s work that he quarreled bitterly withAlfred Kazin,who was considerably less enthusiastic21.Bellow’s The Adventures ofAngleMarchand Henderson the Rain Kingwere especially influenced by Reich. Norman Mailer nevermet Reich, nor was he ever in Reichian therapy, but he absorbed and utilized many of Reich’sconcepts22.During the same period,the talented short-story writer and critic Isaac Rosenfeldwas deeply involved in Reich’s ideas. In a vivid if often acidulous diary, parts of which werepublished posthumously in The Partisan Review, Rosenfeld mockingly commented onIrving Kristol, Nathan Glazer, and Robert Warshaw, all of whom then wrote forCommentary; among the things Rosenfeld disliked about them were their put-downs of24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950323éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"Reich. Rosenfeld also aimed some of his shafts at “Reichians”:The form in which orgone theory is handed around is often very funny.Thus, I was talking to Bill Steig, who said: “A new Bulletin [Reich’s Orgone EnergyBulletin, which began appearing in 1949] has just come out. Very exciting. Reichsays that light doesn’t come from the sun.It turns out that this is merely an account of the diffusion of light throughthe atmosphere, by the excitation of the orgone through solar energy. But the formin which this news comes—“Stop the Press. Light doesn’t come from the sun!”—is undeniably fun.Or must I suppose that to the degree I find such things funny, to thatdegree I am still resisting and looking for a way out?23The diffusion of Reich’s concepts by these and other writers remains a largelyuntold story. With the exception of Steig, Reich devoted little attention to such persons.Caught up in his scientific and practical tasks, he concentrated his energies on relationshipsthat could be of more immediate help to him. Reich often utilized his physicians to defendhimselfagainst attacks. On one occasion in 1948, New York State medical officials wereinvestigating Reich for practicing medicine without an American medical license. Willie,Cott, and Ilse went to see the appropriate officials, stating that Reich was not engaged in thepractice of medicine but in research and the teaching of a new discipline. They succeededin quieting the officials. Some of Reich’s supporters, however, shared this official concern.Willie, for example, clearly felt Reich should have gotten a license and that he was invitingtrouble by not doing so24. He himself went to considerable pains to acquire a Maine licenseso that he could practice in that state when he spent summers in Rangeley. At the same time,he was eager to help Reich against harassment.The continuing attacks against orgonomy, especially as reflected in the hospital inci-dent,further reports of an investigation by the American Psychiatric Association, constantrumors about Reich’s insanity and malpractice with patients, all were beginning to form aclear and present danger to orgonomy. The danger became more acute when in 1947, as weshall see, the FDA launched its investigation of the accumulator. These various threats, andespecially the FDA investigation, led Reich to feel the need to establish a medical organiza-tion that could represent his viewpoint accurately, fight the attacks, and spare his energiesfor research tasks.Hence,in 1948,Reich encouraged the development of the American Associationfor Medical Orgonomy (AAMO), and by the end of that year such an organization wasformed. The board of directors appointed by Reich consisted of Baker, Cott, and Willie.Twenty-one physicians became members of AAMO, as well as Ola Raknes, the Norwegianpsychologist. Nic Hoel (now Waal) of Norway, who had resumed contact with Reich, andWalter Hoppe from Israel were members of the original group.Willie was elected the first president of the Association. In his own remarks aboutMyron SharafFury On Earth324éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"its founding, Reich struck a chord almost in anticipation of later difficulties:We rely on knowledgeand not on form; on learningand not on empty law;on facts and not on titles; on the deep-rooted knowledge about the laws of lifewhich are in man, and not on the politician; on loveand not on the marriage license;on work well done and not on opinions about workdone by others...25.It was not long before controversies erupted between Reich and Willie. A majorissue centered on rules and regulations. Willie and some of the other physicians wantedhighly formal requirements for admission to AAMO: medical school plus internship plus afew years of psychiatric training. Wolfe remarked that with these requirements he himselfwould not be acceptable since he went directly from medical school into psychiatric train-ing, skipping an internship. Reich had argued strongly that the chief requirement should bea medical degree or its equivalent; in the end, his opinion prevailed. Despite his clear com-mitment to medical training as an essential prerequisite for the practice of psychiatricorgone therapy, Reich always wanted to leave the door open for persons with “specialgifts”—the phrase is Willie’s—to be able to practice orgone therapy without medical train-ing.Raknes fell into this category, and Reich maintained this option even though he had hadsome bad experiences with nonmedical people already.Willie served as president for one year and was scheduled to serve a second whenReich intervened. According to Willie, “Reich felt that I was trying to take the doctors awayfrom him.” I asked Willie if this was true. Willie smiled and said, “Competitiveness is woveninto the very warp and woof of my personality.” In any case, Willie was removed as presi-dent and Baker replaced him, in accordance with Reich’s wishes.A welcome respite from external and internal crises was provided by visits fromEuropean colleagues during the postwar period. In September 1946, Ola Raknes came for afour-month visit,the first European co-worker to meet Reich again after the war. He spentSeptember working with Reich in the laboratory at Orgonon. At the end of the month, heand Reich returned to New York, and he continued his studies in Forest Hills.Raknes was the kind ofstudent Reich liked. Many of Reich’s former Scandinavianassociates came to the conclusion that he had gone astray in America, basing their judgmenton a cursory perusal ofhis U.S. publications. Raknes took the trouble to devote severalmonths to careful study of the new orgonomic phenomena directly under Reich’s and Ilse’ssupervision. Reich greatly appreciated Raknes’ seriousness, independence of mind, andreceptivity to new ideas, combined with his determination to test them for himself. Raknesdiffered with Reich on many matters, but this did not spoil their good friendship. Indeed,the differences enhanced the relationship, since they shared a devotion to the central con-cepts of orgonomy.I have already mentioned the importance of Reich’s correspondence with A. S.Neill. The first opportunity they had to meet after World War II occurred in the summer of24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950325éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"1947. Neill arranged a visit to America that included a lecture tour and a stay with Reich atOrgonon. Ilse’s description of Neill’s visit at Orgonon is worth quoting:Neill and Reich talked deep into the night over a glass of whiskey andinnumerable cigarettes. All their favorite topics were taken up: criticism, recogni-tion, socialism, communism, sex-economy in pedagogy, and especially the newbornchild, as Neill had recently become a father of a little girl and found this experience,as did Reich, a marvelous field of study... . Neill saw some of the experimental workthat was going on at Orgonon but he maintained that he did not fully understandit One incident that Neill remembers very clearly is that one afternoon, duringwhich we all sat together talking about cars and other mundane matters, Reich toldNeill that such drawingroom conversations about nothing were sheer agony forhim, they took him out of his sphere of thinking and he could not participate. Thiswas always true for Reich, and was mentioned as a part of his character by manyothers to whom I talked. He could not and would not participate in chitchat andsmall talk26.Then Reich planned the First International Orgonomic Conference for late August1948 to give all the co-workers, American and European, an opportunity to meet with oneanother, hear papers, and exchange views for a few days. Undoubtedly, Reich had in mindsome of the International Psychoanalytic Congresses he had attended in the 1920s and early1930s. Like them, there was to be a social reception to precede the conference. Neill arrivedfrom England, Raknes from Norway, and Dr. Ferrari Hardoy, a psychiatrist who had earlierstudied with Reich, from Argentina.Walter Hoppe was also scheduled to attend. Hoppe, a German psychiatrist, hademigrated in the thirties to Palestine; had made contact with Reich’s writings in the early19405. Subsequently, Reich and he corresponded frequently and Hoppe had his first orgoneaccumulator built while the war was still on.Hoppe experimented with the medical use ofthe accumulator more extensively than any other physician with the exception of Reich.Reich greatly appreciated his independence, daring, and quick grasp of functional principles.He looked forward to meeting Hoppe in person.Inexplicably, Hoppe was detained at Ellis Island upon arrival in New York onAugust 28.Reich was furious at this capricious action by the immigration officials. The angerand hurt from the FDA investigation, the hospital incident, and accusations of insanity thathad overwhelmed him during the past year were now unleashed on behalf of Hoppe. In atorrent ofactivity he sent telegrams to the State Department, the Justice Department, EllisIsland, and his lawyer Arthur Garfield Hays. “This too is research,” he commented. “Hecures their cancers and theythrow him in jail.*’ He attributed Hoppe’s detention to bureau-cratic stupidity rather than any animus against his work from the federal government. Thereasons for Hoppe’s detention never did become clear.On August 30, Reich succeeded in obtaining Hoppe’s release. Wolfe accompaniedMyron SharafFury On Earth326éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"him from New York in a chartered plane that landed dramatically on Dodge Pond on theevening of August 31, where many of the conference participants were already on the smallwharf. I recall Reich rather peremptorily waved the rest of us back as he stood alone to wel-come Hoppe.Hoppe proved to be a delightful, witty man. Short and wiry, his low-keyed ironicapproach offered an interesting contrast to Reich’s. He had taken his detention philosophi-cally, with much less upset than Reich. Yet his talk showed the same kind of appreciation fororgone energy, and the same awareness of man’s tendency in general and of scientificauthorities in particular to explain away the results of the accumulator.A full report on the conference has been presented elsewhere27. Here I will limitmyself to some highlights, with particular emphasis on the ways the conference illuminatedReich’s interactions with his colleagues and his mood and thinking at that time.On August 31, in a meeting limited to physicians, Simeon Tropp spoke on theshort-term, experimental use of psychiatric orgone therapy in the ordinary medical office.Here he was dealing with a wide variety of so-called psychosomatic complaints that mightwell lend themselves to orgone therapy. Reich was intensely interested in this particular kindof application of orgone therapy. However, he worried about the incautious use of thesemethods by insufficiently trained physicians.Hoppe, speaking in German as Wolfe translated, related how he had used a twen-ty-fold accumulator (as well as regular accumulators) in order to establish the work by show-ing the rapid and intensive effects of orgone treatment. He also spoke of the ridicule he wasreceiving from physicians; as with Reich, his positive results were dismissed as “miraclecures,” faulty original diagnoses, and the like.In the discussion period, Reich noted that Hoppe had gone further than Americanorgone therapists, including himself, in the extent of his use of the twenty-fold accumula-tor. Here the fear existed that there might be danger in such an intense application of orgoneenergy, but Hoppe reported no injurious effects. Nevertheless, Reich advised the greatestcaution in using the accumulator.Hoppe’s experience with mocking physicians was instructive, Reich stated, in that itshowed that the hostile reaction to orgone energy was not caused by Reich’s aggressive per-sonality.The mildest ofmen, Hoppe could not be accused of belligerence. Yet he had metwith the same skepticism and ridicule Reich had.Beside the formal papers given at the conference, there were opportunities in themornings for demonstrations of orgonomic phenomena such as the bions in the orgoneenergy dark room.During these demonstrations Reich moved around, pointing out certain things andanswering questions. He gave several informal talks in which he stressed the technique oforgonomic functionalism underlying all experimental results—a technique that was neithermechanical nor mystical, that moved from the complicated to the simple, and that was basedon a thorough study ofemotional functioning.Reich emphasized that orgone energy couldnot be understood without a knowledge of the emotions, nor could the energy behind the24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950327éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"emotions be fully understood without some knowledge of how the same energy functionedoutside the organism.Ilse OllendorfF showed a film Reich had made in Norway on the bions and thedevelopment of protozoa (it is now in the sealed Reich Archives). Another film shown hadbeen made by Reich that summer, with Kari Berggrav serving as photographer under hisdirection. This film included more of his recent discoveries as well as footage on theRangeley lakes and mountains. Berggrav, whom Reich had known in Norway, had filmed forhim there, too; a spirited woman, she sometimes quarreled with Reich about procedure.Once she remarked that he had given her more latitude in the filming in Norway. Reichresponded sharply, “This isn’t Norway. I’m the boss here,” contrasting his authoritarian lead-ership with the more egalitarian arrangements earlier.In making this film, Reich featured his own name in big letters as the discoverer oforgone energy, commenting: “I used to hide under the table. But that didn’t do any good.”Just as the American Reich was more distant from his students and more evidently the“boss,” so he also was more intent on clearly identifying his name with his accomplishment.“I took the beating—now I want the credit.” At other times he explained the emphasis onhis name in a different way: it was identified with the most uncompromising expression ofhis concepts and he wanted that quality to come through.For all the stress on his name, Reich was curiously reluctant to have his face appearin the film. Kari wanted to take some footage of him, so he agreed to walk up and down infront of some instruments. Later, when he looked at the resulting footage, he told Kari totake it out—it looked phony28. In the finished film the most one sees of Reich are hishands. For a large man he had surprisingly small hands, thin, quick, and somehow more del-icate than one would have expected.Reich was at his best during the conference. One could see him then as one rarelysaw him—thoroughly relaxed, enjoying the companionship and success of his work that thisgathering in part reflected, eager to share knowledge, Reich the man who enjoyed people.Yet he kept apart in a definite though not easily definable way. One example was that he didnot participate in any of the parties given by the people, like Willie and Wolfe, with summerhomes in the Rangeley region. While Reich was warm and expansive at the conference, therewas very little small talk from him.On August 30, Ola Raknes had reported on sex-economy and orgone research inNorway.After his visit to the United States in 1946, Raknes had built an accumulator in hisown home, with much opposition from everyone, including Nic Waal and Odd Havrevold.Then, on September i, Reich spoke of the “Consequences of Orgone in Vacuum.”The preceding winter he had made the discovery that orgone energy existed in the so-calledvacuum, and that a vacuum tube, if sufficiently charged with orgone energy in an accumu-lator for several months, luminated blue when excited by another orgone field or a smallelectrical charge29. Reich demonstrated this phenomenon during his talk. However, on thisoccasion he was not so much concerned with technical orgonomic problems as he was withthe question that had preoccupied him that summer while writing Ether, God and Devilname-Myron SharafFury On Earth328éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"ly, Why had not orgone energy been discovered long before? This question linked the phys-ical and the psychiatric aspects of his work: the same fear that prevented the discovery oforgone energy blocked the discovery of the child’s true nature.Unable to penetrate to the primordial, cosmic energy, man—according to Reich—erected two systems of thought, mysticism and mechanism, which were essentially builtaround the concepts of “God” and “ether,” respectively. God was behind all subjective, spir-itual, qualitative phenomena; the ether behind all material, physical processes. Withoutintending to, Reich said, he had hit upon both the God and ether problem when he discov-ered the cosmic orgone energy. Orgone energy, like God and ether, was everywhere and per-meated everything. It was behind both the physical processes in nature and the perceptualprocesses in the human organism. But whereas hitherto man had mechanically split up thecosmic energy into spiritual “God” and physical “ether” and then was unable to reach either,functional thinking discovered the cosmic orgone energy and was able to understand andhandle the concepts practically. And the same factor that throughout the centuries had pre-vented the discovery of orgone energy, of orgastic potency, of “what it is like to be achild”—man’s armouring—now was at the basis of the tremendous fear and hatred oforgonomy.With great intensity Reich spoke of the painful experience of hearing repeatedlyfrom people to whom he showed orgone experimentation, “Very Interesting,” and then nomore. This armoring against real-life problems, this constant, impotent “Very interesting,”had to be overcome before any genuine progress could be made. Reich concluded by sayingthat there were no authorities in the field of orgonomy. If orgonomy represented a new wayof thinking and a new science, then to ask the authorities of the old science to confirm itwas—to say the least—naive.I never heard Reich speak so eloquently. It was as though on that night everythingcame together. In his scientific thought he had advanced far enough to know exactly whathe had discovered. He had attracted a number of colleagues who, with varying degrees ofcommitment and intelligence, listened attentively, giving him at least some of the responsehe wanted,even though there were still far too many reactions of “Very interesting.” He wassurrounded by very good friends that evening: Neill, Raknes, Wolfe, Hoppe, and others.There was no visible attack on the horizon to harass, distract, or infuriate him. It was one ofthose precious lulls between storms.There was extraordinarily little bitterness from Reich during the conference. It wasas ifhe were beyond bitterness. He held his own ground adamantly against the attributionof authority to persons who had not earned it, an attribution rampant even among some ofhis closest co-workers who wondered, covertly if not overtly, what “real” scientists thoughtofhis work. But there was no rancor.In subsequent years Reich was to go on making discoveries, discoveries that wereperhaps even more important than those he demonstrated at the 1948 conference. However,his rage was also to grow as the harassment intensified. Never again was there to be quitethe same golden sense of harmony, insight, and understanding. Never again was Reich to24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950329éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"seem so receptive, so accepting yet firm where the central themes of his work were in jeop-ardy. Recalling Reich in the summer of 1948, one cannot help but wish that his environmenthad provided more of the support and peace that was in evidence during the FirstInternational Orgonomic Conference. Although he often said he could work alone, that heneeded no recognition, it was equally true that people were important in his lifetime and thattheir responses buoyed his spirit.I have commented at some length on Reich’s excellent contributions and demeanorduring the conference. However, he can be faulted quite severely in one respect: he did notreally facilitate a similar quality from others. He invited good questions and comments, andwas always generous with praise for contributions. Yet he reacted so sharply to what he con-sidered to be poor questions or comments that participants often censored their valuable aswell as their hostile or banal reactions. A discussion led by Reich might consist of a few com-ments from others, to which Reich would then respond with mini-lectures. He rarely invit-ed a more general discussion. For all his emphasis in therapy on expressing negative feelings,there was little room for doing so in conferences. Reich could not, or perhaps would not,expose himself to the same material outside therapy.Inevitably, no strong group could be sustained in this atmosphere. And howeverunderstandable Reich’s position, it also reflected his own need to control events around him.The group atmosphere was authoritarian, in Kurt Lewin’s sense of the term. Most of thelines of communication were between Reich and students, little between student and stu-dent. Reich further contributed to the intensity by insisting on a high degree of profession-al secrecy among co-workers. Reich once commented on his failure to build up a viableorganization along work-democratic lines, adding: “If that should continue, it would reflecta problem in me.”30It did continue and it did indeed reflect his own problem.One of Reich’s chief preoccupations during the summer of 1948 was the orgoneenergy motor. * During the following summer, these fears were heightened when an assis-tant,William Washington,who had been working on the motor, did not appear at Orgononas scheduled.I had met Bill, who was black, in the fall of 1944 at the University of Chicago,where we were both freshmen. He was especially interested in mathematics and physics, buthad a wide-ranging knowledge in many realms. Although he talked extremely little, he alwaysMyron SharafFury On Earth330éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Reich never published the design for the orgone energy motor and I no longer remember the details of theexperimental set-up or its operation. I do recall that it involved the use of an accumulator attached to a wheel; con-centrated orgone energy was triggered by a small amount of electricity, an amount insufficient to rotate the wheelwithout the accumulator. I also recall that when the wheel was rotated entirely by electricity, it had a steady grind-ing motion.When powered by the combination of orgonotic and electrical energy, it ran smoothly and quietly; butits speed varied depending upon the weather more rapidly on dry, clear days, more slowly when the humidity washigh. During this summer, Reich was extremely excited about the motor and envisioned its industrial applications.He also expressed considerable concern that the “secret” of the motor might be stolen, which may have con-tributed to his reluctance to publish the details."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"followed with slight nonverbal motions very carefully what others said. He seemed to meextremely intelligent and I attributed his taciturnity to his being very short. He appeared tobe enthusiastic about Reich’s work when I introduced him to it.In 1947, Reich was looking for an assistant to help him in mathematical and exper-imental work. Bill started working with him in the summer of that year, concentrating onmathematics. The following summer Bill did more laboratory work and had the particularresponsibility of helping Reich develop the orgone energy motor. When he left Orgonon inthe fall of 1948, he took the motor set-up with him in order to work on further refinements.He was supposed to return to Orgonon in early summer 1949, but he did not appear, norwas there any word from him. By August, Reich was extremely concerned about Bill and themotor.During this time we checked out various stories Bill had told us about his previousemployment, for example, that he had once worked at the National Argonne Laboratories(a division of the Atomic Energy Commission). None of these stories proved true. Nobodyever discovered what happened to Washington or the motor, but Reich was able to speakwith him on the telephone late in the summer of 1949. He sounded quite hesitant in hisspeech a hesitation Reich construed to mean that he was not free to speak. At one point,Reich asked ifhe was being coerced. Washington answered, “In a way,” but did not elabo-rate. It was my impression that Washington was happy to grab at any straw to get him offthe hook of being, for whatever personal reasons, unable to finish the assigned job.However, Reich did not choose that mundane explanation. He provided Washington withthe suggestion that he was being externally coerced—by the Atomic Energy Commission,the Communists, or someone. Washington’s answer was just enough to keep Reich’s ideaalive, although he also entertained the possibility that Bill was simply sick or sociopathic.Washington was never heard from again. I have lingered on the incident becausesuch episodes made one wonder about Reich and his work. If he could dredge up a possi-ble kidnapping or espionage plot on such slim evidence as existed about Washington, whena simpler explanation was readily available, of what other inventions might he be capable?In retrospect,I see the Washington story as another example of how wrong Reich could beabout people and social events when his own wishes and fears were strongly involved. Atsuch times his marvelous capacity for seeing the underlying, objectively fruitful patterns inman and nature degenerated into the wildly oversimplified symbolism of the western movieshe so loved, with their good guys, bad guys, and dramatic denouements. As Lavater once putit:“A daring eye tells downright truths and downright lies.”In short, the Washington incident provides a nice example of the paranoid aspectofReich’s psychic functioning. He had always been capable of such erroneous pattern-find-ing, but this tendency increased sharply in his last years. His critics use examples like theWashington case to seal their diagnosis of his entire later work as a grandiose paranoid sys-tem.Many of his supporters in their turn go to tortuous lengths to find justifications for hisview ofWashington and for other instances ofhis bizarre thinking.In my view, the truth is not so neat. During the same period Reich was capable of24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950331éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"the most profound, objective thought and experimentation and of the most extreme, para-noid ideas. How do these pieces fit together? In part, there is the aforementioned disposi-tion toward pattern-making which, as Ernest Hartmann has suggested31, is common toboth creativity and paranoia. But one cannot explain everything. In Donald Hall’s wordsabout the dual Ezra Pound—the great poet and most generous mentor to other poets, andthe dispenser of the crudest anti-Semitic, pro-Fascist propaganda: “I do not fit these piecestogether; they are together in the mystery of a man’s character and life.”32During the fall of 1949, Reich seriously considered staying year round at Orgonon.He was tired of dividing his time between New York and Maine. In late 1949, he made oneof his few references to his age (he was fifty-two at the time): “I have only a few productiveyears left and I must safeguard every moment.”33He was also eager for the physicians toparticipate more in the scientific aspects of orgonomy. And most of them were prepared toparticipate, but only up to a point.Although not ready to make the move that fall, Reich came to the decision in thespring of 1950. For a period during that winter Reich was very happy. He had returned toNew York, and was delighted to start the Orgonomic Infant Research Center. However, inthe end he decided that the gains of Orgonon outweighed the losses of leaving the city. Aswe have seen, for years he had resented the interruptions to his research and writing causedby seeing patients. Now he was extremely tired of clinical work, of becoming “entangled”in people’s problems. Reich also recognized that he was no longer such a good clinician inthe sense of being accepting and patient.Some half dozen co-workers made the move to Orgonon with Reich in 1950: IlseOllendorff; Eva Reich, who by this time had completed her medical training and whoseinterest in her father’s work had grown considerably; H. Lee Wylie, a young physician whoalso had some background in physics;Lois Wy veil, the managing director of the OrgoneInstitute Press; Simeon Tropp, his wife Helen, and his three-year-old son Jimmy; and I. (Aswe shall discover,Wolfe had largely withdrawn as an active co-worker, though his advice wasstill valued by Reich.) In late May 1950,after six months ofnot working with Reich, I returned toOrgonon, now simply to work with Reich with no thought of being in therapy with him.That summer I remember as golden. There was a glamour surrounding his activities. Reichwas in a very good mood—active, expansive, human. I was franker with him than I had everbeen and he appreciated it. Among other tasks, I was responsible for the editorial prepara-tion of the Orgone Energy Bulletin, a quarterly Reich had begun publishing in 1949 to replacethe International Journal for Sex-Economy and Orgone-Research.There were other incidents that suggested some darker currents beneath the appar-ently smooth surface of Orgonon’ s relationship with the community. Helen Tropp appliedfor a teaching position at the local public school (which Peter Reich now attended) and theprincipal informed her that no one connected with Orgonon could be employed there. * Myron SharafFury On Earth332éditionsles atomes de l’âme*It is an ironic historical footnote that on July 15, 1981, a symposium was held at Orgonon on “Self-regulation"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Another, more dangerous, incident concerned the investigation of Orgonon by arepresentative of the state police. The investigator went to a children’s camp nearby, whichhad no connection with the Orgone Institute. There a counselor was interrogated aboutwhere the children canie from, whether the camp “fed” children for the Orgone Institute,whether it was a nudist camp, and so forth. Another investigated rumor involved my allegedchasing girls at night.Reich took various actions against these rumors. He continued the policy estab-lished earlier of confronting very directly the originators of the rumors, going to somelengths to determine who they were. One particular example was telling. We suspected alocal citizen, seemingly friendly toward Orgonon, of saying that Reich and his associateswere Communists. At Reich’s direction, I wrote the person asking if he had in fact circulat-ed the rumor. There was no reply, but others confirmed his identity as the rumor-spreader.Reich prepared a letter, signed by the Orgonon staff”, which was sent to a number ofRangeley citizens. In it, he described the danger of slander and gossip, and the way that slan-derers, or people with emotional plague, rely on other people’s fear of being slandered them-selves. Here Reich was applying concretely—and I think with some success, in thisinstance—his sociological emphasis on the interaction between emotional plague citizensand the average neurotic.During this period, however, a far more ominous, if subterranean attack was con-tinuing. I am referring to the Food and Drug Administration’s investigation of the orgoneenergy accumulator.24 : Personal Life and Relations with Colleagues: 1941-1950333éditionsles atomes de l’âmeand Learning in Children,” honoring the publication ofRecord of a Friendship: The Correspondence Between Wilhelm Reichand A.

The operativeword is “relatively.” For only in contrast with the Norwegian press campaign of the late1930s and what was to come afterward can the period between 1940 and 1947 be viewed aspeaceful. It included Reich’s detention at Ellis Island in 1941, various snide articles, and,above all, constant rumors concerning Reich’s alleged insanity and malpractice with patients.But there were no organized or sustained attacks, jeopardizing his capacity to function.All this was to change shortly after an article appeared in the May 26, 1947, issueofThe New Republic. The article, under the byline of Mildred Edie Brady, a free-lance writer,was entitled “The Strange Case of Wilhelm Reich.” The subheading, in large type, ran: ‘Theman who blames both neuroses and cancer on unsatisfactory sexual activities has been repu-diated by only one scientific journal.”Other attacks had appeared in the American press. However, no one combinedtruths, half-truths, and lies as skillfully as Ms. Brady. Many future writers on Reich were to relyalmost solely on her for their information. One key passage that was picked up by many writ-ers ran as follows: “Orgone, named after the sexual orgasm, is, according to Reich, a cosmicenergy. It is, in fact, the cosmic energy. Reich has not only discovered it; he has seen it,demonstrated it and named a town—Orgonon, Maine—after it. Here he builds accumulatorsof it which are rented out to patients, who presumably derive ‘orgastic potency’ from it.”Ifone combines the subheading with the quoted passage, Brady’s message is clear.The accumulator gives “orgastic potency,” the lack of which is responsible for everythingfrom neuroses to cancer.Ergo, the accumulator will cure neuroses and cancer. Moreover,Reich makes a profit by renting cure-all accumulators to the public.Brady had taken the trouble to read—or misread—Reich’s writing, something manyofhis critics had not done. In addition, although Reich made a practice of refusing pressinterviews, Brady was able to talk with him by posing as an enthusiast of his work with newsfrom friends on the West Coast. Having bearded the lion in his den, she was able to createa kind of chatty intimacy with the reader about the strange Reich:...Reich runs a considerable establishment ... , and he has more patientsthan he can take care of. As you climb the stairs to his second-floor office, you findpictures ofstellar nebullae along the way. You find Reich to be a heavy-set, ruddy,brown-haired man of50,wearing a long white coat and sitting at a huge desk.Between periods of training students in his theories and putting patients into335éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"orgone accumulators, he will tell you how unutterably rotten is the underlying char-acter of the average individual.In this passage Brady correctly plays Reich’s individual notes, but she totally distortshis melody. Her deft insinuation that Reich was a swindler and a megalomaniac would per-meate many subsequent articles on orgonomy as well as the FDA investigation.Brady’s main point could be discerned from the insinuations: the psychoanalyticorganization should discipline itself, in other words, do something about “the growing Reichcult,” or else it will “be disciplined by the state.”The political context of the article is important, not only in itself but for whatReich made of it. At the time of the Brady article, The New Republic was under the editor-ship of Henry A. Wallace. Wallace had resigned from the Truman administration in 1946 inprotest of its cold-war policies. In 1948, he was to run for President on the Progressive Partyticket. By even the most charitable accounts he was much influenced by AmericanCommunists during this period1.As a sign ofThe New Republic’s Stalinist line under Wallace, the magazine onDecember 2, 1946, had published a review by Frederic Wertham of Reich’s The MassPsychology of Fascism.Wertham accused Reich of “utter contempt for the masses” because hestressed their mysticism and incapacity for freedom. Reich, Wertham said, represented athreat to the left because he confused liberals by leading them away from the political strug-gle. Reich advocated “psycho-fascism.”Given the all but universal fear of orgonomy, Reich had long worried that a cam-paign of the magnitude of the Norwegian one would break out in America. The AmericanPsychiatric Association, the American Medical Association, the psychoanalysts, the pharma-ceutical industry, one or another political party—all were possible candidates to mobilize theopposition. The appearance of Wertham’s and Brady’s articles in short succession in a fel-low-traveling journal convinced Reich that the Stalinists had won this dubious honor.IfReich was right in stressing Wertham’s and especially Brady’s role in spearhead-ing the American campaign,he was wrong in ignoring the contribution of the political rightto his difficulties. In the late 19405, many Americans were shocked to discover both the bar-barity ofSoviet totalitarianism and the extent ofStalinist penetration of various domesticorganizations. These genuine fears merged with an irrational anxiety about “un-American”radicals.Right-wing demagogues such as Joseph McCarthy were quick to exploit and esca-late this amalgam of concern over “subversive” individuals.Brady’s article was extremely successful in drawing positive attention to itself andnegative attention to Reich. A condensation of it was published in Everybody’s Digest,a nowdefunct popular magazine that then had a circulation in the millions2.Collier’s borrowedfrom it heavily in an article which stated that the “orgone and the accumulator can lickeverything from the common cold to cancer, according to Dr. Reich.”3Excerpts appearedin Scandinavian,French, and Swiss papers. As late as 1954, when Irwin Ross published along article on Reich in the New York Post,he took over Brady’s title and much of her con-Myron SharafFury On Earth336éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"tent4. But the most outrageous use of the article was by a well-regarded psychiatric journal,the Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic5, which simply reprinted Brady’s piece in its entirety as theBulletin’s official position on Reich, about whom the editors had had inquiries. This intellec-tual laziness on the part of a professional journal is a good example of how contemptuous-ly Reich was regarded by the establishment: one did not have to study his writings, one needonly republish a hatchet job by a free-lance writer. Brady wove the slander together; otherskept repeating it.The most dangerous result of the article was that it alerted the Food and DrugAdministration to the “Reich problem.” About two months after the article appeared, onJuly 23, Dr. J. J. Durrett, director of the Medical Advisory Division of the Federal TradeCommission, sent the following letter to the FDA:Attached is a photostatic copy of an article by Mildred Edie Brady whichdeals with Wilhelm Reich... . We have not investigated Reich and his activities. Fromthe article it appears that he has set himself up as a local practitioner of psychia-try... . The reason I am sending this to you is that he appears to be supplying hispatients with a gadget which will capture the seemingly fantastic substance“orgone” and accumulate it for the benefit of the person who occupies the spacewithin this device. I thought you might want to look into this6.“Wharton* has been variously described by FDA people who worked with him as‘ruthless’ and ‘dictatorial’ as well as one of the five most powerful men in the agency at thattime.’‡When Wharton eventually obtained an accumulator for study, he kept it in his officeand “joked about it as a means ofgaining sexual prowess, a la Brady. This is a box,’ Whartonwrote on August 26,‘in which a man is placed and thereby becomes permeated with orgone,which is a progenitor of orgasm ...’ Charles A. Wood, resident FDA inspector for the stateofMaine and the first FDA agent to ‘investigate’ Reich and his work, said of Wharton manyyears later: ‘He was crazy about that Reich case and didn’t think of anything else during thewhole time.He built it way out of proportion.’”8Wharton directed Wood to launch a preliminary investigation of Reich and hisMaine headquarters. On August 27, Wood went to Orgonon to meet Reich. “Dr. Reich isfifty years old, speaks with a German accent, and was dressed in blue dungarees and a workshirt at the time of the visit,” Wood later reported. He added an editorial comment: “Helooked anything but professional.”9Greenfield has described how Wood “was greeted cordially by Reich, to whom heexplained that he had come to find out whether the accumulator might be classified as adevice according to FDA law.” Reich asked Wood how he had found out about the accumu-25 : The American Campaign Against Orgonomy The Beginnings: 1947-1948337éditionsles atomes de l’âme*R.M.Wharton was chief of the Eastern Division of the FDA.‡For this and other material about the investigation in general, I am indebted to Jerome Greenfield’s fine study,Wilhelm Reich Vs. the U.S.A.(New York: W.W. Norton, 1974).7"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"lator. He was angered by Wood’s mention of the Brady article as his source. “He admittedthat the accumulator was indeed a device, though in an experimental state. ...”Reich then arranged for Wood to visit the site where the accumulators were con-structed. This visit led to a novelistic twist in the story. At the workshop, Wood met ClistaTempleton. Clista had taken over the construction of the accumulators after the death ofher father, Herman, in 1944. Some three months after Wood met Clista, they married. Clistawas the main informant to Wood about the accumulators. This was a particularly dramaticexample of how personal and scientific issues often became enmeshed where Reich wasinvolved.Wood learned from Clista Templeton that to date some 250 accumulators of vary-ing sizes had been built. Most important, Clista supplied names and addresses of accumula-tor users to Wood. Her guilt or fear about her role as informer was expressed in her reluc-tance to become a witness in any trial against Reich; she did not want Reich to know thatshe had “doublecrossed him,” to use Wood’s phrase10.Following Wood’s report, Wharton replied in September in a letter to the Bostonoffice out of which Wood worked: “From our review of this material it appears that we havehere a fraud of the first magnitude being perpetrated by a very able individual fortified to aconsiderable degree by men of science. In order to invoke appropriate ... action, we must layour foundation well and secure in the beginning considerable data and information.”11On September 24, Wood returned to visit Reich at Orgonon. He continued hisquestions about Reich’s teachings, whereupon Reich referred him to his books. Reichbecame angry when Wood asked about his expulsion from the International PsychoanalyticAssociation. It must have seemed demeaning to Reich to discuss his important and painfulconflict with Freud in answer to a routine question from an FDA agent who knew absolute-ly nothing about these matters except Brady’s statement that “Freud saw fit to take issue withhim.”During the course ofhis visit with Wood (who on both occasions had come toOrgonon without prior notice),Reich was interrupted by someone from Rangeley who hadcome to discuss his accumulator treatment. (Reich did not usually see patients at Orgononbut made an exception for local citizens, whom he treated free of charge.) To quote Woodin his report:According to Dr. Reich, Mr. Brackett was confined to his bed with arthri-tis three years ago and could not walk or use his hands. Brackett is an old man withhands stiffand out ofshape, but he could move his fingers and walked fairly well.He was the real “testimonial” type and Dr. Reich took great delight in bringing outMr. Brackett’s miraculous story of recovery by use of the accumulator. (His casecan be investigated ifdesired.)12For a period,Reich continued to cooperate with the FDA. He told physicians work-ing with him to answer questions about the accumulator but not to supply the names ofMyron SharafFury On Earth338éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"patients. Patients who had been contacted by the FDA—through Clista’s list of users—wereadvised by Reich to answer questions about their use of the accumulator,but not about theirpersonal or sexual lives.However, it became clear during the fall of 1947 that the FDA agents were suspi-cious of, among other things, a sexual racket of some kind. Dr. Simeon Tropp, for example,reported being questioned about women associated with orgonomy and “what was donewith them.”13When Reich became aware of these questions, he was enraged. Nothingangered him more than the accusation that he ran some kind of “sex racket.” He had notyet reached the point of breaking off all contact with the FDA but he was close to it.The evidence also continued to support the idea that the FDA had prejudged thecase. Thus, Wood visited Tom Ross at Orgonon later that fall. Tom reported: “Mr. Wood ...came in while I was working in my workshop and told me spontaneously ... that the accu-mulator was a fake ... and that Dr. Reich was fooling the public with it. He said the casewould break soon and hinted that Dr. Reich would go to jail.”14The combination of the pornography accusation and the FDA’s blatant prejudg-ment persuaded Reich to limit his cooperation forthwith. Thus, when the FDA asked for anaccumulator for the purpose of testing it, Reich refused to comply unless the FDA permit-ted an orgonomist to take part in the testing and unless the agency made clear what it wasinvestigating. “I would ... rejoice ... if the testing by the administration would be made ina rational manner,” Reich wrote. “[But] the one who in the name of the government willundertake the testing will have to prove that he believes in our honesty.”15On November 19, Reich’s lawyer, Julian Culver from the Hays law office, tele-phoned Wharton.In a memorandum ofthe conversation, Wharton denied any preconcep-tions on the FDA’s part. They were still investigating and had not reached any conclusions.Wharton insisted that there could be no cooperative testing, although “we would be perfect-ly willing to listen to Dr.Reich and let him make any demonstration he cared to make withthe device.”16Wharton made a favorable impression on Culver. The latter advised Reich to givethe FDA an accumulator since they would get one anyway17. Reich did not follow hislawyer’s advice. He believed it was a mistake to cooperate in the testing of the accumulatorunder conditions that made a fair test remote. One of his chief concerns was a circumstancehe had encountered often in the past: the idea of a box accumulating energy from the airwas so ridiculous that the control experiments would be sloppily executed. The insinuationofpornography and the evidence of prejudgment boded ill for a bona fide test.Reich was also keenly aware, as his lawyer was not, of the depth of hatred againstorgonomy. Lawyers, as well as many of Reich’s colleagues, were often inclined to discountthe emotional significance ofirrational statements or actions by the FDA and to overem-phasize what appeared to be reasonable behavior, as in Wharton’s phone conversation withCulver. Reich took the opposite tack, highlighting the irrational and perceiving a conspirato-rial explanation for the FDA’s action (the influence of the political left on the investigation).The two orientations were bound to clash.25 : The American Campaign Against Orgonomy The Beginnings: 1947-1948339éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Reich also refused the FDA’s request for the names and addresses of patients onthe grounds that this was privileged information. Here he was supported by his lawyer, whostated that since the privilege belonged to the patient alone, it could not be waived by Reich.Unbeknown to Reich or his lawyer, the FDA had its own source of information for thenames and addresses of accumulator users.By the winter of 1947-48, Reich was reaching the end of his tether. A statement hewrote in December and mailed to accumulator users and colleagues conveyed his state ofmind. His first written protest was formally entitled “Statement Regarding Competence inMatters of Orgone Energy”:I would like to plead for my right to investigate natural phenomena with-out having any guns pointed at me. I also ask for the right to be wrong withoutbeing hanged for it.I am angry:I am angry because there is so much talk of free speech and fair play. True,there is much freedom and fair play in regard to everyday matters. But, to my greatsurprise, I found that newspapers and magazines were open to smearing attacks onmy work and my name;that one writer after another copied Brady’s slanderousstatements, without first trying to find out the truth in our literature, and that thesame newspapers and periodicals seemed unwilling to publish a simple correctionof misstatements.I am angry because a Government agency which is supposed to safeguardhuman health didtake affidavits from people who professed not to have beenhelped by the accumulator but did nottake affidavits from others who told themthey had beenhelped.I am angry because smearing can do anything and truth can do so little toprevail, as it seems at the moment.I am angry because once again the political plague knifed hardworkingpeople in the back18.Reich was wrong in one regard: the FDA files do not contain any affidavit from anyaccumulator use indicating dissatisfaction. From time to time the FDA would lament itsinability to obtain such affidavits.The statement also contained a line of attack which, unfortunately, Reich was toelaborate in increasing detail, namely, the idea that he had been knifed by the “politicalplague.” Here Reich was referring only in part to the FDA. More importantly, he meantMildred Edie Brady. The idea was growing in his mind that Brady was more than a fellowtraveler; she was a Stalinist, and may well have been acting on direct instructions from theCommunist Party. Brady’s Stalinism became a firm conviction. The evidence about Bradywas scant—the tone ofher article, its appearance in The New Republicunder Wallace’s editor-ship, and some hearsay about her politics. A friend of Reich’s wrote him that in 1936 BradyMyron SharafFury On Earth340éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"was “in sympathy” with the Communist Party, but later information was not available19.Regrettably I, too, contributed to the loose political characterization of Brady by repeatingto Reich a statement heard from Dwight Macdonald. Macdonald had casually mentionedsomething about the fellow-traveling or Stalinist sympathies of Mildred and her husband,and Reich exaggerated the significance of this vague remark.His time eaten up by the FDA investigation, Reich was strongly tempted to turn thewhole matter over to the physicians working with him. On December 20, he informedCulver that he was transferring all rights to the medical use of the accumulator to theOrgone Institute Research Laboratories, the nonprofit corporation he had formed on April30, 1945, to further his research.Dr. Willie, Dr. Tropp, and Ilse Ollendorff would deal with the FDA and relatedmatters in the future. “I have done my part in discovering orgone energy, in elaboratingsome of its qualities, and in constructing a device to accumulate it which, to my experience,has shown great possibilities in being useful as a medical device,” he concluded20.Whenever one reads of Reich’s intention to divest himself of responsibility for theaccumulator, one can only fervently wish that he had executed this plan. Accumulator rentalswere helpful in supporting his research, as we know; yet he could have made more moneyfrom his teaching and clinical activities in less time and with less aggravation than from theaccumulator and its administrative concerns. But the Reich who discovered orgone energycould not abandon his “device,” as the FDA was forever describing the accumulator; hecould not abandon its practical implementation or function through others. Nor did he trusthis associates to fight for the accumulator in the proper way. They would follow legal adviceand give the accumulator to the FDA, which for Reich was tantamount to the Jews diggingtheir own graves in concentration camps. They would answer—they had answered—FDAquestions that had nothing to do with the accumulator in order to be “good guys” or out offear of having their medical licenses revoked. They would muddy up his clean discovery.By the same token, in my view, they would not have made some of his mistakes.They would not have referred to Brady as a “communist sniper,” as Reich did in a 1947 com-munication.* Indeed,Reich could not get Wolfe—to Wolfe’s credit—to attack Brady forbeing a Communist, when in 1948 Wolfe wrote a brilliant polemic,Emotional Plague versusOrgone Biophysics21,in response to her New Republicarticle and its aftermath. Nor would theyhave become enmeshed in such issues as whether or not the FDA had jurisdiction over theaccumulator, In short, they would have been more likely to avoid Reich’s characteristic errorswhen confronted with irrational, unacknowledged rage and contempt—his denial of any25 : The American Campaign Against Orgonomy The Beginnings: 1947-1948341éditionsles atomes de l’âme*In fairness to Reich,it should be noted that in recent years at least one astute observer of left-wing politics hassaid that in 1947 Brady, whom he had met, parroted the Stalinist line of that time (cf. letter of August 12, 1982from Jerome Greenfield to the author about this observer). This evidence is far from ironclad and it does not provethat Brady was a member of the Communist Party, but it gives a sounder basis to some of Reich’s views that theyhad in the late 19405. It should also be noted that we cannot peruse the files of communist parties to see what theymay have been planning against Reich and what persons they may have enlisted as hatchet men in the same waythat we can study the FDA’s file on Reich since the Freedom of Information Act was passed in 1971."},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"common humanity between his opponents and himself, his refusal to try persistently toengage in rational discourse with the opposition, and his belligerent ascription of only theworst motives to his challengers.These important caveats aside, as one reviews the documents from the fall.of 1947one sees that Reich was right in many of his key assessments the FDA’s prejudice, the porno-graphic misrepresentation of his work, the linkages between the Brady article, psychoana-lytic-psychiatric attacks on his work, and the FDA investigation. Above all, he was right inrecognizing the scope of his work, the magnitude of the hatred against it, and the necessi-ty for developing and following clean, direct ways of responding to the attacks, for not feel-ing guilty in dealing with the energy of sexuality.Reich knew well the temptations of compromise and how simple it was for his stu-dents to succumb to those temptations. He might well have stated with Nietzsche: “Nowwhy will [the great man] ... try to feel life? Because he sees that men will prompt him tobetray himself, and there is a kind of agreement to draw him from his den. He will prick uphis ears and gather himself together, and say: ‘I will remain my own.’ He gradually comes tounderstand what a fearful decision it is.”22Under the impact ofa persistent attack from the FDA, Reich’s coworkers feltfrightened and were strongly tempted to go the “pleasant conventional way.” His lawyerassured people that Wharton was a very reasonable man, he just wanted an independent testof the accumulator. How easy to succumb, especially if one wonders: Maybe the accumula-tor is not all that Reich claims for it. One’s inner self-doubts are triggered and amplified bythese attacks.By contrast, Reich characteristically fought off his own guilt feelings by attackinghis enemies even more than they deserved. Excessive blame of others often masks self-recrimination, and so it was for Reich in many of his personal and professional relationships.But it also served an adaptive function here: it helped to protect him from the enervatingeffects ofguilt and self-doubt at times when almost everyone, through threats or blandish-ments,was urging him to violate his principles.There was a lull in the investigation during the spring of 1948. Wharton had sentthe information gathered so far to Washington for a decision as to whether a full-scale test-ing effort should be undertaken in order to secure an injunction against the accumulator.Keen as he was on obtaining such an injunction,Wharton was also aware of certain prob-lems. As he reported on May 18, 1948: “No dissatisfied users were located and all personsinterviewed were extremely satisfied with the results which they attributed to the device.”23The FDA was also interested in linking Reich’s literature with the accumulator, claiming theformer was promotional material for the latter. However, as the FDA noted, users had oftenobtained Reich’s books and journals long before they ordered the accumulator, so that thewritten works were not in fact “accompanying literature.”Reich misinterpreted the pause in the investigation, believing it had permanentlystopped.Moreover, he also believed that the FDA had been impressed by his frank policyMyron SharafFury On Earth342éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"of noncooperation and his refusal to surrender. This kind of misreading of events furtheredthe tragic and irrational aspect of Reich’s handling of the case. He wantedhis policy to stopthe investigation. He came to believe, quite erroneously, that it hadstopped it. As we know,Reich was prone to dramatize events, especially under stress. He took the real hatred oforgonomy on the part of many groups, political and scientific, but then gave that hatred aconspiratorial twist it did not possess. Similarly, he overestimated the effects of his ownactions in stopping the FDA. He could never fully accept the “banality of evil”—that thebureaucratic action against him, however much inspired by the special venom of a Brady ora Wharton, also proceeded on its own momentum, quite impervious to Reich’s blasts orproud refusals to cooperate.Reich’s undue optimism about the course of events was to lead to some majorerrors. However, it helped him rechannel his energies back to his work. The investigationwas finished, he had won, he did not have to worry about the FDA. At the same time, a morerealistic side of him did continue to worry even if in a less direct form than previously. Oneway he expressed this concern was to search urgently for still more dramatic, socially need-ed applications of orgone energy.25 : The American Campaign Against Orgonomy The Beginnings: 1947-1948343éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"26 : The Oranur Experiment: 1950-1953With the permanent move to Orgonon in 1950, Reich became preoccupied withthe relationship between orgone energy and nuclear energy. He had been concerned sincethe first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945. In November 1945 hehad published the following remarks: “We shall have to learn to counteract the murderousform of the atomic energy with the life-furthering function of the orgone energy and thusrender it harmless.”1The Korean War, which broke out on June 25, 1950, added to Reich’s sense ofurgency. He had never ceased to be an intensely political animal in the etymological sense ofthat word, concerning the citizenry. He believed the accumulator could help in the wareffort, especially in the treatment of wounds and burns. There was also a general fear thatthe Korean War could lead to a global nuclear conflict; Reich had hopes that orgone energymight be helpful as an antidote to nuclear radiation.These hopes were based on several earlier findings. The most relevant observationwas that accumulator treatment increased the bio-energetic vigor of the blood. Hence, itmight alleviate the blood system disturbances (e.g., anemia, leukemia) associated with radia-tion sickness. More specifically, Reich had noted that burns due to X-rays could be healedby orgone treatment. In December 1950, he published a brief report in which he cited hisfindings and outlined a research project to investigate whether concentrated orgone energycould diminish the harmful effects ofnuclear radiation2.He named this study Oranur,anabbreviation for Orgone Energy (OR) versus Nuclear Energy (NR). It stated clearly whathe wanted to prove: First, a degree of immunity against nuclear radiation could be achievedthrough prior exposure to concentrated orgone energy. To this end, a group of healthy micewould be charged with orgone energy for several weeks. Then one half of this group wouldbe injected with a half-lethal dose of radioactive material, the other half with a lethal dose.These two groups would be compared against each other and against control groups ofhealthy mice untreated by the accumulator that received half-lethal and lethal doses ofradioactive material. The results would help to establish if and to what extent preventiveorgone treatment was useful.The second proposed experiment involved treatment. A group of healthy micewould be injected with a half-lethal dose of nuclear radiation prior to any exposure oforgone energy. Then one half of the injected mice would be treated with orgone energy, theother injected but untreated halfserving as a control. This experiment was designed to rep-resent two groups of people some distance from a nuclear explosion, with both groups suf-Myron SharafFury On Earth344éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"fering a half-lethal dose of nuclear radiation but only one receiving post-injury orgone treat-ment.Before proceeding with these experiments, Reich made what was to prove a fatefuldecision: he decided to run a preliminary experiment to explore the effects of orgone ener-gy on radioactive material itself. So he ordered two one-milligram units of pure radium, oneto be exposed to concentrated orgone energy, the other to serve as a control.Let me comment here on the background of Reich’s use of radium in this experi-ment. First, it is an interesting historical footnote that this step took Reich back very closeto the beginning of the atomic age. In 1895, Wilhelm Rontgen discovered artificially inducedX-rays, a form of radioactivity. In 1896, Henri Becquerel set out to determine whether aradiation like X-rays was emitted by “fluorescent” bodies through the action of light. To hissurprise, he found that uranium salts, without the presence of light, emitted a spontaneousradiation that penetrated photographic plates.In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie discovered radium, which emitted a much morepowerful radioactivity than uranium. Only a few years later, Pierre Curie became the first vic-tim of “radiation sickness” when he deliberately exposed his arm to radium and a burnappeared along with more diffuse symptoms such as fatigue and body aches. The long-termharmful effects ofradioactivity were still to be discovered. Indeed, both Marie Curie and herdaughter Irene, who later worked with radium, died of leukemia, the cause of their illnessbeing attributed to their lengthy exposure to radium. But if radium could harm, it could alsotreat. It destroyed not only healthy but diseased tissue, thereby removing tumors. Moreimportant than its immediate uses, the discovery of radioactivity—or more precisely, the factthat matter could disintegrate into radiation—led eventually to atomic physics as we knowit today.Reich’s first studies were built on a series of discoveries also made in the nineteenthcentury. During the same years that Rontgen, Becquerel, and the Curies were launching theatomic age, Freud was inaugurating the psychological revolution. There are striking parallelsbetween the two sets of discoveries. Psychoanalysis could look beneath the surface of themind just as X-rays could penetrate the surface ofthe body. The energy of libido could bebound in symptoms and character traits analogous to the binding of energy in matter. Therelease ofinstinctual energy from its defense mechanisms or armorings could take destruc-tive forms, like radioactive decay from matter. Indeed, for Freud, though not for Reich, itwas impossible to conceive of a free flow of energy in civilized man without some anti-instinctual structures (repressions, defense mechanisms). All of Reich’s differences withFreud turned on the nature of free-flowing libido, the desirability or undesirability of itsblockages,and the proper way to dissolve rigid structures.Now, in 1950-51, Reich was confronting modern atomic theory. Once again, theissues turned on the relationship between energy and structure, or mass. In the atomicmodel,mass could be transformed into energy, but the released radiation was destructive toliving tissue.Even the electron contained a small amount ofmass embodying its charge ofnegative electricity. Yet orgone energy was life-furthering and mass-free. Whereas in his26 : The Oranur Experiment: 1950-1953345éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"debates with psychoanalysts Reich was thoroughly conversant with the concepts and clini-cal data on both sides, he frankly acknowledged his deficiency in physics. In 1945, he wrote:“I have not mastered mechanisticphysics as well as I might or should.”3However, his oppo-nents would also have to accept the possibility “that the discovery of cosmic energy mayshake the foundations of their special picture of the physical world.” Both sides, then, hadto risk defeat in an open, honest, paradigmatic debate.To return to the Oranur experiment: Although the one-milligram units ordered byReich may seem a small amount, radium emits so powerful a radiation that extreme caremust be exercised in its use. Reich kept the radium in a thick shield and his assistants usedlead gloves and lead aprons in handling the material.Before starting the experiment proper, Reich established the “normal radiation” or“background count.” According to classical science, normal radiation is present constantlyfrom radioactive materials in rocks and, especially, from cosmic radiation. At Orgonon inDecember 1950 the background count was approximately 35 counts per minute (CPM), asmeasured by a Geiger-Miiller (GM) counter4.On January 5, 1951, Reich placed one milligram of radium in its lead shielding in agarage outside the laboratory as a control. It was not exposed to any special orgone accu-mulations. The other, experimental milligram was placed in a small, one-fold orgone charg-er, which in turn was placed in a twenty-fold accumulator. The radium within the accumu-lators was then placed in a large room, built of accumulator materials, which served as a“dark room” for the visual observation of orgone energy (hereafter referred to as the ORroom). In this way Reich intended to see if the accumulator could neutralize the effects ofthe treated radium compared to the control.Five hours after the radium was put in the accumulator, Reich checked the labora-tory and found the air charged and oppressive. Objectively, the GM counter “jammed,” thatis, the impulses were faster than the GM could measure when it was brought near the accu-mulator in the OR room.That it was not a failure in the battery of the meter which causedthe “jamming”became apparent when Reich removed the meter to the fresh air, whereuponit once again gave the normal background count of about 35 CPM.Reich was not prepared to relinquish the experiment, but he did want to reduce theominous charge inside the laboratory. The experimental radium, still in its small orgonecharger, was removed from the OR room and taken to a shed some 150 feet away from thelaboratory. The laboratory was aired with the hope that the high charge would dissipatequickly. But ventilation did not seem to help. Nor was the radium per se causing the heavi-ness,for one could get very close to the removed radium without feeling any of the illeffects—heaviness in the air, a sense of oppression, headaches, nausea—that one felt in thelaboratory.After ventilating the laboratory, the background count diminished. It is interestingthat the GM count was only one index Reich used in determining a new, puzzling, and pos-sibly dangerous development in his experiment. The quantitativecount was not sufficient toestablish the qualitativemeaning of the phenomenon. Earlier, in 1948, Reich had found thatMyron SharafFury On Earth346éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"a GM counter allowed to soak for several months in an orgone-charged atmosphere couldregister very high counts when in or near orgone accumulators with no subjective illeffects5. In this instance, however, the background count diminished but the subjective sen-sations continued, even growing more intense as the days passed. Reich paid close attentionto the sensations he and many of his co-workers experienced, such as a salty taste on thetongue; a severe pressure in the depth of the cheekbone; nausea; loss of appetite; sensationsof weakness; a ringlike pressure around the forehead; sensitivity in the diaphragmatic seg-ment; pallor; and feelings of cold shivers alternating with hot flashes.I was assisting Reich in various tasks connected with the Oranur experiment. Hewas tremendously excited as the Geiger-Miiller count increased after the radium was put inthe laboratory. I remember his excitement, concern, and curiosity about the subjective reac-tions. He would ask his assistants repeatedly: “What do you feel now?”Reich rapidly conceptualized the first surprising results of the Oranur experiment:Contrary to expectations, orgone energy had not counteracted nuclear energy but rathernuclear energy had altered orgone energy. The signs of this transformation were the highbackground count even after the radium had been removed and the unpleasant subjectivesensations. The first day’s effects were so great that all but the most necessary work in thebuilding was stopped immediately.Not long after January 5, Reich gave two names to orgone energy that had beenaltered by nuclear radiation. One was DOR (Deadly ORgone); the other was simply“Oranur,” derived from the experiment itself but now emphasizing the effects of nuclearenergy on orgone energy rather than the other way around as expected. Reich would useboth terms interchangeably.Despite the various subjective reactions of his assistants, Reich with his usual dar-ing continued the experiment. For the next six days he placed the experimental radium inthe twenty-fold accumulator for an hour each day. On January 12, it remained there for onlyhalf an hour. Soon after the radium was deposited, Reich and several persons with himnoted that the atmosphere in the laboratory had become clouded. It showed a blue to pur-plish color through the glass windows. Reich felt sick to his stomach and dizzy. Dr. Tropphad similar reactions.At this point the experiment was interrupted although, as we shall see, many aspectsReich was to note about the interaction between orgone energy and nuclear energy contin-ue today in the interaction between orgone energy and diverse forms of pollution. Theorgone-treated radium was placed a half mile away from the laboratory, buried in the groundof an unused field.After describing his own and Tropp’s intense reactions, Reich’s main report touchedon a variety of reactions and interpretations of events that occurred in the aftermath of theexperiment. Unlike many of his writings, it was completed swiftly, most of it by the end ofApril 1951, and published that October. The points made below are drawn largely from thisreport:Workers who were in contact with Oranur reacted in a highly specific manner, each26 : The Oranur Experiment: 1950-1953347éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"being attacked at his or her weakest point physically. All had recurrent attacks of their symp-toms during the Oranur experiment.The most dramatic example of the Oranur effect exacerbating a specific, existingsymptom involved Eva Reich. She had long suffered from bradycardia, or a slow heartbeat.In February after the experiment she was cleaning out a metal-lined cabinet in the laborato-ry; she “smelled” something like Oranur and in order to make sure, put her head into thecabinet. Thereupon it “hit her like a wall” She lost her balance and was brought up to theObservatory. Reich saw her and found her pulse rate to be very slow, about 46 per minute.He was also alarmed because her heartbeat continued to weaken and she had difficultybreathing. He gave her some cognac and urged her to keep talking, all the while proddingher to stay in contact with him6.After two hours she began to recover. However, for some months she continued tosuffer Oranur effects in milder form.In May of that year Ilse, who had previously suffered from uterine symptoms, hadan operation because tests indicated uterine cancer. Afterward her surgeon informed herthat she was indeed fortunate to have had the operation since the pathological process wasquite advanced7. Connections between this illness and her relationship with Reich will bediscussed in the next chapter, but here it is important to stress that she attributed her illnessthen, as she attributes it now, to Oranur. Her judgment carries ail the more weight becauseof her skepticism vis-à-vis certain aspects of the Oranur experiment.I myself experienced fatigue, pressure around the eyes, and headaches—symptomsI had also experienced previously under stress. Indeed, that Oranur brought out or exacer-bated what was already present meant that there was no specific Oranur illness. As discussedin Chapter 2, my relationship with Reich was worsening at this time and I was inclined toattribute my symptoms to my emotional upset with him rather than to Oranur. In retrospect,I believe both factors were operative.Some further findings:Periods of unusual well-being seemed to alternate with periods of Oranur or DOR-sickness.Persons who had been in the Oranur experiment from the beginning reacted lessseverely to its effects than visitors to Orgonon.These two factors led Reich to hypothesize an immunization effect from exposureto Oranur. He thought the original goal of immunization might still be achievable. However,on February n, thirty experimental mice died suddenly with symptoms of radiation sickness(e.g., disturbances in the blood system). This finding, combined with Eva’s severe reaction afew days later, persuaded Reich to give up the idea temporarily of seeing if Oranur had anyimmunization effect. He was more concerned with stopping the reaction, which he now per-ceived as dangerous. So he took the following steps:(1) All accumulators at Orgonon were dismantled. This posed problemsMyron SharafFury On Earth348éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"since in certain instances of DOR-sickness the accumulator usage had been help-ful. But, again, stopping the reaction took priority.(2) Reich banned any radioactivity whatsoever, however slight, in his envi-ronment. Peter Reich has narrated a poignant incident here. By sending in cerealboxtops, Peter had obtained a Lone Ranger glow-in-the-dark ring and was veryproud of it. When Reich found out about the ring, he insisted it be removed: “Theglow in the dark substance may harm you. It may be very dangerous. Right now weare [conducting] an experiment to help us understand it. I’m sorry. I know you likeit as a toy, but we must get rid of it.”Peter’s response was: “I tried to look angry at him, but I couldn’t even seehim because my eyes were so blurry and mad. He didn’t even want me to play withit a little bit. All he thought about was his energy.”8“All he thought about was his energy”—and now especially its reaction toradioactive substances. Eva, too, was very sensitive to the emanations from radium-dial watches, fluorescent lights, and even TV. It is important to emphasize that forReich the danger lay not in the radiation effects per se but in their action uponorgone energy.(3) Other health measures Reich advocated strongly were frequent airingof rooms, the use of fans to keep the air moving, daily baths with prolonged soak-ing, and intake of fluids. Reich had long emphasized that water absorbed orgoneenergy, but now he noted that it absorbed DOR at an even faster rate.What was and remains most impressive is the rapid and profound way Reich con-ceptualized the many observations he made, starting on January 5. He had begun with thehypothesis that orgone energy would neutralize nuclear energy. Given the high backgroundcount and the sensations that persisted after the removal of the radium, he quickly movedto hypothesizing the trigger effect of nuclear energy on atmospheric and organismic orgoneenergy.As far as the human organism is concerned, he had begun with the conventional ideaofspecific radiation symptoms, such as nausea, fatigue, and diseases of the blood system,although all of these dysfunctions can be found without overirradiation as the cause. He hadalso begun with the idea ofa high orgone energy charge serving as resistance to radiationsickness. However, he was surprised by the way people reacted to Oranur through their ownspecific vulnerabilities.Again, he conceptualized radiation sickness in a new way: not, basi-cally, as due to the effects of nuclear energy, but to the effects of nuclear energy actinguponorganismic orgone energy. In short, nuclear energy caused both atmospheric and organis-mic energy “to run amok,” with the latter “running amok” specifically in ways it had react-ed under stress in the past.Reich also posited a three-phase reaction of orgone energy to nuclear energy. Thefirst reaction to sudden, unexpected radiation was prostration, shock, helplessness, as itwere.The second phase involved orgone energy fighting back, becoming “angry, a killeritself, attempting to kill the irritating nuclear radiation. In this struggle it deteriorates into a26 : The Oranur Experiment: 1950-1953349éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"killer of the organism which it governs.” Then he postulated a third phase in which orgoneenergy, if available in sufficient fresh supply, overcame nuclear radiation and the triggeringof an Oranur chain reaction. Reich based his assumption of OR energy triumphant on hisobservations of periods of very good health enjoyed by some Oranur workers. It was alsobased on the fact that some small samples of nuclear radiation which Reich had had foryears seemed to be rendered innocuous by prolonged exposure to orgone energy; they had,for example, lost their ionizing capacity to conduct electricity. However, during the Oranurexperiment itself, Reich was far more impressed by the reality of the first and second phas-es than by any real hope for the third.These positive results paled in comparison to his surprise at finding a deadly qual-ity in orgone energy, hitherto seen as entirely benign. However, Reich recalled other phe-nomena where healthy organisms turned malignant. For example, in fighting sick T-bacilli,healthy PA bions can themselves be transformed into destructive T-bacilli. Most striking ofall for Reich was the fact that a healthy person, when fighting evil, might himself change anddevelop the same characteristics he was fighting against.Indeed, as I shall discuss in the next chapter, under the twin pressures of Oranurand the worsening FDA situation, Reich himself became more destructive than ever in hispersonal relationships.During the Oranur experiment, I had the opportunity to observehow badgering he could be when embarking on new terrain. (In my view, this tendency washeightened by the effect of Oranur upon him.) He wanted everybody to respond stronglyto his newest, beloved child—now Oranur. In the face of the avalanche of new observa-tions, Reich was undoubtedly not as secure in his convictions as he appeared. His need fora confirmatory response from others was akin to Oliver Cromwell’s plea: “Believe and helpme in my unbelief!” After a research advance had been consolidated, he could be morerelaxed (within limits!) toward skepticism and criticism.As always, Reich’s natural-scientific work interacted strongly with his social con-cepts.He began to see the “emotional plague chain reaction” as analogous to Oranur. Theemotional plague reaction was comparable to nuclear radiation. It infected others, and theweaker the energy system,the more easily it was paralyzed by the noxious poison. Evenhealthy persons were often first paralyzed by the shock of their encounter with the plaguebefore they fought back.Finally, in retrospect one is struck by how prescient Reich was. Today, atomic tests,nuclear wastes, and harmful X-rays can produce public outrage. But such was not the casein 1951.Within weeks of the Oranur experiment, Reich was concerned about the effects ofall kinds of toxic influences (chemical offal, electromagnetic pollution) on atmospheric andorganismic orgone energy. I recall thinking, back in 1951, that his concern with minutetraces of radium on watch dials and TV emissions was excessive, if not insane. Today, theuse of radium in watches is rapidly declining9, effects of fluorescent lights have beennoted10, and people are advised not to sit too close to TV sets11.With the surge ofecological interest in the late 1960s and 1970s, we are more awarethat there is a limit to the “insults” our planet—this “fragile blue biosphere”—can surviveMyron SharafFury On Earth350éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"and that we are fast approaching it. Reich had his ecological consciousness raised during theOranur experiment. He became concerned not only with the dangers of nuclear radiationbut also with chemical pollution and the danger from nonnuclear forms of electromagnet-ic emissions. The latter too, he noted, could in sufficient dosage “irritate” orgone energy ina noxious way. Since the 1960s, the classical theory of radiation sickness has grown moresimilar to Reich’s in its recognition that relatively low levels of nuclear radiation and nonnu-clear emissions (e.g., from microwaves) can have harmful cumulative results12. However,there remains little awareness of Reich’s basic conceptual thrust: that it is not pollution perse—chemical or energetic—that is the main menace, but rather its effect on atmosphericand organismic orgone energy. Classical theory, moreover, focuses entirely on mechanicalfactors, the amount of radiation one is exposed to in a given period, or the part of the bodyaffected by the radiation, in assessing the risk factor. Characteristically, as we have seen in hiswork on cancer, Reich focused on both the specific toxic agent and the individual’s particu-lar energetic vulnerability. Thus the debate between Reich’s Oranur concepts and classicaltheories of radiation sickness has yet to occur.By March 1952, Orgonon was evacuated; the high Geiger-Muller counts persisted,as did the subjective malaise. Reich’s assistants worked out of their apartments or homes andhad only brief meetings at the Observatory with him. Ilse and Peter went to an apartmentin Rangeley. Reich moved around a great deal (as we shall see in Chapter 27), occasionallystaying at the Observatory but never for very long.By this time, he was concerned with a new development. He noted a quality of“stillness” and “bleakness” over the landscape13. Reich’s description of this “bleakness”closely resembles Rachel Carson’s in Silent Spring, written some ten years after the Oranurexperiment.Reich was especially impressed by what he called “DOR-clouds.” These bore aremarkable similarity to what would later be called air pollution or smog. DOR-clouds, blackand bleak,could be present even in the midst of sunshine. When they were, the motility ofanimals was diminished, the atmosphere felt “suffocating,” and the sky seemed to lose itssparkle.* 26 : The Oranur Experiment: 1950-1953351éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Reich describes the “emotional flavor” (his words) of DOR-clouds in a manner reminiscent of the nineteenth-century art critic John Ruskin.Indeed,the comparison goes further since Ruskin was, to my knowledge, the firstwriter to comment on the atmospheric effects ofintensive coal usage in England in the 1880s. Ruskin noted withhorror a new kind of cloud, which he termed the “plague cloud.”(!) The “plague cloud” was in sharp contrast togood weather clouds, which were “either white or golden, adding to, not abating, the lustre of the sky.” It also con-trasted with the clouds ofwet weather, which were of two types: “Those of beneficent rain ... and, those of storm,usually charged highly with electricity. The beneficent rain cloud was indeed often extremely dull and grey for daystogether, but gracious nevertheless, felt to be doing good, and ... capable also of the most exquisite colouring... .The storm cloud [was] always majestic ... and felt also to be beneficent in its own way, affecting the mass of the airwith vital agitation, and purging it from the impurity of all morbific elements.” The plague cloud, on the other hand,was “grey ... not rain-cloud but a dry, black veil which no ray of sunshine can pierce... . That thin, scraggy, filthy,mangy miserable cloud can’t turn the sun red, as a good, business-like fog does with a hundred feet or so of (....)"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"In an effort to do something about these debilitating clouds, Reich hit upon the ideaof trying to “draw off” energy from the clouds by means of long metal pipes, directedtoward the DOR-clouds and connected through cables to a deep well. Here Reich was mak-ing use of an observation common to orgone energy and DOR: both were attracted towater. And, indeed, when he aimed the pipes toward the clouds, they began to dissipate andthe oppressive atmosphere was alleviated.Out of this initial work grew what Reich later called “cloud-busting,” an operationnot limited to DOR-clouds. (The interested reader can turn to the literature for more detailon the subject.) Briefly, Reich became concerned with influencing the dispersal of orgoneenergy in the atmosphere. By varying his method of drawing, he claimed to be able to influ-ence the atmospheric potential either in the direction of concentration of energy (cloud for-mation) or in the direction of dispersal of energy (cloud dissipation).Reich likened the action of the “cloud-buster” (as he came to call his pipes ground-ed in water) to the lightning rod. For Reich, the lightning rod, too, functioned according toorgone energy principles, since “lightning” is a concentrated atmospheric energy dischargein a very narrow space. The pointed rod, reaching into the atmosphere, attracted the light-ning discharge and conducted it through heavy wires into the ground.Let us jump ahead a little to see why this work may be ofreal significance. By July6, 1953, or just over a year after his first experiments with weather modification, Reich feltsufficiently confident to test his work outside the Orgonon area. At the invitation of twoMaine blueberry growers who wanted rain to save their crops from persistent drought, Reichconducted an operation with his draw tubes, by now a rather elaborate device mounted ona truck. The results were reported in the Bangor Daily Newsof July 24:Dr. Reich and three assistants set up their “rain-making” device off theshore of Grand Lake, near the Bangor hydro-electric dam, at 10:30 on Mondaymorning 6 July. The device, a set of hollow tubes, suspended over a small cylinder,connected by a cable, conducted a “drawing” operation for about an hour and tenminutes.The scientist and a small group of spectators then left the lake to awaitresults.According to a reliable source in Ellsworth the following climactic changestook place in that city on the night of 6 July and the early morning of 7 July: “Rainbegan to fall shortly after ten o’clock Monday evening, first as a drizzle and then bymidnight as a gentle, steady rain. Rain continued throughout the night, and a rain-fall of0.24 inches was recorded in Ellsworth following morning.”Myron SharafFury On Earth352éditionsles atomes de l’âme(...) itself.” Ruskin’s description of various kinds of clouds, including pollution clouds, merits attention because, inmy view, painters and art critics anticipated many of Reich’s descriptions of the atmosphere just as novelists andpoets anticipated his psychological findings.

They paid the agreed-upon fee for the operation *.Reich conducted other weather modification efforts over a broad area. By 1954 hehad several cloud-busters, and at least one functioning in the New York City area. In July ofthat year there had been a severe drought in the Northeast. Notifying the Weather Bureauof his intentions, Reich began the first of a series of drought-breaking operations. He wassuccessful in New York and also in several other operations.In assessing Reich’s work in this field, there is always the problem of chance. AsJames McDonald, a professor at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University ofArizona, commented: “The presence of natural variability in atmospheric events, which can-not be controlled or suppressed, may lead to effects twice as great as the one [the researcher]sought to induce experimentally.”14However much the need for caution in evaluating Reich’s weather work, the initialresults still remain impressive. He announced when he would engage in weather modifica-tion and I know of no instance where he failed. Weather modification following Reich’sprinciples and techniques has subsequently been carried out by several investigators withpositive results15. Indeed, one of the first replications of Reich’s experimental work underuniversity auspices dealt with cloud-busting. In his master’s thesis on cloud-busting for theDepartment of Geography/Meteorology, University of Kansas, James DeMeo noted thathis efforts were successful in decreasing clouds when the cloudbuster was used for that goal,and in enhancing clouds when that was his intent.He concluded:“While a high degree ofstatistical significance was not achieved in this preliminary study, the data and phenomenaobserved do fit comfortably with a positive interpretation of the device’s efficacy.”16Despite these promising replications, with cloud-busting as with all of Reich’s nat-26 : The Oranur Experiment: 1950-1953353éditionsles atomes de l’âme*The blueberry cloud-busting was Reich’s first effort motivated in part by a desire for publicity; it was also thefirst “contingency fee” he ever received. He thereby gave the appearance of joining an unsavory tradition of nine-teenth- and early twentieth-century Americans who promised rain for drought-stricken farmers with a similar “cashon delivery” agreement. None of these rainmaking forays was based on solid concepts or was replicable beforecloudseeding with dry ice was introduced in 1946. See Clark C. Spencer,The Rainmakers: America’s “Pluviculture” toWorld War II(Lincoln, Nebr.: University of Nebraska Press, 1980).Other aspects ofReich’s work lent themselves to association with scandalous traditions, e.g., his “body therapy”with the sexually arousing massages of some nineteenth-century hypnotists, his accumulator with quack cancercures. Throughout his scientific career, Reich took great pains to separate not only the content but also the tone ofhis work from such misalliances; he scrupulously avoided advertising or any other kind of promotional activity.However, by 1953, desperate in the face of growing opposition from the FDA and various professional organiza-tions, he wanted to go straight to the public through dramatic, well-publicized achievements."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"ural-scientific work we lack the broad-based research that could validate or disprove hishypotheses and shed light on the theoretical constructs underlying those hypotheses.During March 1952, while Reich was concerned with “DOR-clouds,” he noticedchanges taking place in the rocks at the fireplace of the Observatory. They appeared to beblackening and undergoing a process of progressive crumbling and disintegration. “In manyrocks the surfaces have lost their smoothness; the rock surface looks ‘spongy’ as if the rockhas been drilled and innumerable holes of about 1/16th or 1/8th of an inch in diameter anddepth had been hewn into the surface.”17One particular rock developed small holes with a powder-like substance that couldbe removed by wiping off the surface with a finger. Observing this rock carefully, Reich sawthe steady increase in the number of holes on its surface. He also noted that the white pow-dery substance became streaked with blackish particles *.Of this blackening, Reich wrote that he severely doubted himself when he first sawthe phenomenon. He went so far as to deny the observation. This was the kind of skepti-cism Reich could permit himself but not his assistants18.The DOR process and the cloud-busting together led Reich to believe that he hadfound important leads to the comprehension of desert development and desert fructifica-tion. (Four years after the start of Oranur and two and a half years after observing the black-ening rocks, Reich would test these hypotheses when he made an expedition to Arizona inthe late fall of 1954.) Almost concurrently with the discovery of orgone energy in 1940, Reich had begunto formulate armor blocks as consisting of immobilized orgone energy. Again aroundMarch 1952, he started thinking of the frozen energy in the armor as DOR, which was anew insight stimulated by his observation of atmospheric DOR. When the armor prevent-ed the unimpeded flow of energy, a person’s healthy energy was blocked. Orgone energy,trapped within the armor or muscular spasms, became transformed into DOR, quite apartfrom any atmospheric influence. Here again Reich was establishing one of his sweeping con-nections an identity between the black DOR-clouds and the “black” DOR in the humanorganism19.Black was more than a metaphor for Reich, even though the color neatly fitted themetaphysical concept ofevil or the Devil.His hypothesis of DORclouds and their removalwas tested through the use of the cloud-buster. So also was his notion or armor containingDOR. About a year after the development of the cloud-buster, Reich had the idea of usingMyron SharafFury On Earth354éditionsles atomes de l’âme*“The same kind of phenomena Reich noted in his fireplace was to become of intense concern in the art worlda few years later. Although the effects of pollution on stone art works had been noticed from the beginning of theindustrial age, this problem did not become a menace until the late 1950s, Then it was noted in Italy, for example,that the fourteenth-century frescos of Giotto were being lost to posterity as the walls on which the murals werepainted crumbled away. A specialist on the restoration of American stone buildings declared in 1965 that century-old structures had suffered more decay in the last twenty or so years than in the previous eighty.” Howard Lewis,With Every Breath You Take(New York: Crown, 1965), 119."},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"the same principle, indeed the same device but on a smaller scale, in the treatment of humanbeings. Pipes connected with water were applied to the human body. Once again, it soundsutterly improbable that such a device should have any therapeutic efficacy. However, aboutfifteen psychiatrists trained in orgonomic therapy have used the device, along with more tra-ditional Reichian methods, in the treatment of patients. There has been only one good con-trolled study of the DOR-buster, in the treatment of cancer mice; positive results wereobtained20.When Reich discovered orgone energy, he made it the basis for a synthesis of cre-ative forces in the organism and the atmosphere. Between 1940 and 1950 he had the oppor-tunity to explore this synthesis in physics, biology, psychiatry, medicine, education, and soci-ology.In 1951, he started with a “simple” experiment—to see whether orgone energycould reduce harmful nuclear radiation. In the ensuing process he believed he had discov-ered a sweeping view of the destructive forces in man and in the environment. In Reich’sview, atmospheric and organismic orgone energy had to be irritated or blockedbefore DORemerged in virulent pathological form. Still, in a “normal” state, DOR was part of life. In away that Reich was just beginning to conceptualize, DOR was part of the process of death.In Reich’s view, the common functioning principle of diverse kinds of death was blockedlife energy.The most practical implications of the whole Oranur experiment, incomplete as itmay have been, concern its relevance for understanding and mastering the growing pollu-tion of the environment. Reich only began a few empirical investigations, as with the cloud-buster. It is worth repeating that for Reich what ultimately mattered was not a new abstractsynthesis but concepts that generated testable hypotheses. He could not continue his DORinvestigations for long because a different “investigation,” the FDA’s, was yielding its ownfruit—a kind Reich would perceive as yet another manifestation of DOR in the form of theemotional plague.26 : The Oranur Experiment: 1950-1953355éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954The Oranur years marked a huge upheaval in Reich’s personal life. From 1940 to1950, his existence had been much as he had described Freud’s: “He lived a very calm quiet,decent family life.”1In her biography of Reich, Ilse Ollendorff was reluctant to describethe more intimate aspects of her marriage. The outward impression remained one of a cou-ple united by work rather than intense love. Peter was an important bond between them.However, Reich’s main energies were clearly devoted to his work. It is my belief that someofhis pessimism about adults and his devotion to infants and children, to the unarmored,reflected not only his accurate appraisal of adult humanity but also a dissatisfaction with hisown life.In any case,during the Oranur experiment Reich erupted. In part this eruption wasstimulated by Oranur itself. During the spring of 1951, he was unable to stay at theObservatory for any prolonged periods due to the effects of Oranur. He began to movearound, sometimes staying at the lower family cabin; however, even there the atmospherewas affected by Oranur. Reich would occasionally take overnight trips to Farrnington,Maine, about forty miles from Rangeley, to escape the Orgonon atmosphere. And he tookmany more drives than he had previously, partly again for relief from the atmosphere, part-ly to observe the nature and extent of Oranur effects.Oranur contributed in other ways to the spirit of change and dislocation. As notedin Chapter 26, Reich emphasized that Oranur brought out not only latent physical vulnera-bilities in people but also hidden emotional problems.And what Oranur started, Reich triedto complete.When he felt that people were not straightforward with him or were ambiva-lent, his response was to be more badgering.An especially dramatic interaction of this kind occurred with his daughter Evaabout a month after her severe Oranur reaction. On March 24 (Reich’s fifty-fourth birthday),he gave Eva the present of a fine, expensive microscope. Eva was ambivalent about the gift,saying that she was uncertain where she would be living and that it might be difficult for herto care properly for the instrument. That he gave her this present on hisbirthday may havemade her feel,with some resentment, that he wanted her to be exactly like him—to sharehis devotion to orgonomy and to orgonomic microscopy in particular. Reich became enor-mously enraged, inferring in her hesitation hostility toward him and his work2.Both Eva’s and Reich’s behavior may have been amplified by Oranur effects, trig-gering her old fear ofcloseness to Reich and his tendency, when disappointed, to outburstsof excessive rage. In any case, Reich told her to leave Orgonon, which she did for about aMyron SharafFury On Earth356éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"year, taking a residency in pediatrics in New York City. She also had some therapeutic ses-sions with Baker.The Oranur period coincided with a major reorganization of Reich’s life, as sooften happened after a new scientific development. The discovery of orgone energy in 1940had launched a period of quiet scientific work, undistracted by the intense emotionalinvolvements with people that had characterized the Oslo stay. But in the process, Reich hadmade certain renunciations he was no longer prepared to endure. The high-pitched excite-ment of the Oranur experiment escalated his own emotional needs for a more intense per-sonal life.Ilse’s uterine operation took place in early May 1951. She was away from Orgononfor about six weeks. Reich used her absence from work to insist that she initiate divorce pro-ceedings3. He wanted to try to maintain their relationship, but believed it had a betterchance of surviving without a marriage license. He had never felt happy with the legaliza-tion of their relationship, which had been dictated by outside factors.Upset by her illness and her conflicts with Reich, Ilse had some therapeutic sessionswith Baker, who was becoming the family physician; she also stayed at Baker’s home duringthe convalescent period in May. In early June, she submitted to Reich’s plan and went toArkansas to initiate the proceedings. The divorce became final on September 13, 1951. WithReich’s consent, Baker as a witness submitted an affidavit, testifying to Reich’s neglect ofIlse, and citing his unwillingness to go out socially to parties or to entertain Ilse’s relativesand friends in the Reich home. These complaints are a good example of how Reich foundbehaviors acceptable to the court as grounds for divorce that did not impugn his character.Indeed, he took pride in his commitment to basic natural-scientific research, which prevent-ed his participation in normal social life.Ilse, who had submitted to the divorce in the hope of saving the relationship,deeply resented its timing in connection with an operation that had left her feeling vulnera-ble and depressed. It was one of the major grievances that, along with Reich’s insistence onher abortion in the early 1940s and his sexual double standard, she continued to hold againsthim long after their separation4.In the spring of1951,Reich began a sexual relationship with Lois Wyvell, then incharge of the business aspects of the Orgone Institute Press. Wyvell had worked for thePress for five years and was one of Reich’s most devoted assistants. Thirty-eight anddivorced, she had moved to Orgonon in 1950 when the work became concentrated there,even though it presented a lonely life for a single person.For many years Reich had been a lonely man, but he was especially so after theOranur experiment. Ilse’s emotional inaccessibility was particularly painful to him now. Andwith Oranur he felt intellectually isolated as well, since Ilse did not bring the same enthusi-asm to this phase that she had brought to earlier research. On her part, she felt badgered byhis insistence that she respond to this or that phenomenon and withdrew even more, there-by closing the vicious circle. With Lois Wyvell, as with Lia Laszky in the late 1920s and GerdBergersen in the late 1930s, Reich found a port in the storm, a haven from the domestic war-27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954357éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"fare that had become enmeshed with his battles with the world. Moreover, Lois, unlike Gerd,was keenly interested in and supportive of Reich’s work, even if she lacked the scientificbackground to follow it fully. And she could respond to Reich’s human predicament.Reich was drawn to her honesty, her vivacity, and her commitment to orgonomy.Wyvell loved Reich’s warmth, excitement, and genius. She learned and grew through him—intellectually, emotionally, sexually. However, according to Wyvell, Reich was not in love withher nor she with him. He would sometimes say, “At this moment I love you,” with someemphasis on the first phrase, so there would be no misunderstanding5. Wyvell had similarsentiments. Only on rare occasions would she feel Reich’s full contact with her, an experi-ence of incredible warmth as she described it. In his words to her: “Usually my mind is part-ly with my work.”As with everyone else, Reich carried out a kind of informal character analysis withWyvell. He would tease her about her mystical attitude toward him and orgonomy. At times,he would liken her persistent attitude to a bumblebee buzzing around him. Still, they had afree and comradely exchange of views and feelings.Upon her return to Orgonon on June 9, Ilse was hurt and angry about Reich’s rela-tionship with Lois Wyvell. He justified it on the grounds of various dissatisfactions with Ilse,but he was not prepared to end his relationship with Ilse nor she with him. For some threeyears they continued a very difficult life together, sometimes far apart, sometimes closer toone another.Whatever Ilse’s unhappiness, Reich’s own conflicts about the situation, or theinevitable gossip and local scandal, Reich was determined not to relinquish the relationshipwith Lois Wyvell for the wrong reasons. Right around the time of this affair, Reich wrote TheMurder of Christ, which we will later discuss in detail Here it is pertinent to note the work’semphasis on people’s need to foist an ascetic image on their leader and then compel him tolive up to that image. According to Reich, the “new leader,” the leader who refuses to be mys-tified, will insist upon his right to lead a healthy sexual life. In 1951, Reich insisted.But the freedom Reich took for himselfwas not granted to others. On the contrary,his sexual double standard, his jealous rages became worse than ever after the Oranur exper-iment, perhaps because it exacerbated his conflicts. A particularly malignant episode was theresurgence ofhis old suspicions about Ilse and Theo Wolfe having had an affair while Reichwas detained at Ellis Island in 1941 (see Chapter 20). Just as Reich’s jealousy toward Ilse canbe viewed as one symptom oftheir deteriorating marriage, so his suspicions of Wolfe wererooted in the increasing distance between the two men.Wolfe’s assiduous efforts on behalf of orgonomy during the war years began todecline around 1947.He had become tired of his tedious tasks of translating, editing, andpublishing orgonomic literature, tasks he had carried out superbly for seven hard years.Moreover, by that time Reich was writing in English, so the more creative side of Wolfe’sfunction was no longer needed. Reich repeatedly urged him to do some scientific work, forexample,to conduct research on cancer. But Wolfe was not willing or able to undertake sucha task; besides, his chief interest lay in the therapy of neuroses. Yet Wolfe, who was a shy,Myron SharafFury On Earth358éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"distant man, had difficulties tolerating the expansion and excitement connected with orgon-omy and with Reich. He made a valiant effort for many years because the emotional andintellectual depth of the work meant so much to him. But it was at considerable cost; forexample, Wolfe experienced a psychotic episode during his treatment with Reich in Oslo inthe late 1930s6.To all these factors Reich added another hypothesis: Wolfe’s orgonomic zeal wasbeing undermined by his wife, Gladys Meyer. Reich’s relationship with Meyer and his con-cern about her influence on Wolfe were of sufficient importance that I must backtrack a fewyears to give a fuller picture here.Not long after his relationship with Jo Jenks ended, Theo met Gladys Meyer, onNew Year’s Eve, 1943. Gladys was thirty-four at the time, Wolfe forty-one. They quicklybecame involved with each other, but Reich was not interested in meeting her until the rela-tionship was a serious one. He did not want to see Theo’s casual women friends.A few years later Gladys Meyer became a member of the sociology department atBarnard College (where she would remain a beloved teacher until she retired in 1976). A tall,empathic, and immensely thoughtful (in both senses of the word) person, Meyer could alsobe bitingly critical and had a slight air ofhauteur. During the summer of 1944, she spent timeat Theo’s cabin on Mooselookmeguntic Lake; by that point their relationship was serious.Meyer’s first sight of Reich was in front of the Rangeley Post Office. Reich was in his carwith Ilse and their infant son Peter. Ilse and Reich were quarreling slightly as to whetherthere was too much sun on the baby. They seemed a very European family to Meyer.In other ways, too, Reich, as she got to know him, was quite European in Meyer’seyes. At times he reminded her of a “great vigorous Austrian peasant.” In his domineeringmoods, he evoked memories of professors from the Frankfurt school in Germany whereshe had studied in the early 1930s.During those summers of the 19405, Reich and Wolfe consulted with each otheroften. More occasionally, the Wolfes and the Reichs would visit socially, although no meet-ing with Reich was “social”in the usual sense.Meyer recalls sitting on the porch with Reichand discussing the youth movement he had known in Germany and Austria. Reich had won-dered if there would ever be a similar kind of movement in America. Meyer had not thoughtthere would be,but she was impressed by his searching questions.In 1945, Meyer went into treatment with Reich, partly at Wolfe’s urging since he feltthat ifshe experienced therapy, she would better understand why he was so absorbed inorgonomy. She found therapy “only rewarding.” Reich was a disciplined therapist, though attimes he could provoke her very directly. In one session she had remembered her childhooddistress when a boy threatened to attack her with a knife. Reich took some deer antlers hehad in his office and moved toward her, simulating the original incident to elicit her emo-tions. Meyer jumped off the couch.The therapy only lasted a few months. As with so many people, Gladys Meyer’stime in treatment coincided with her most intense interest in orgonomy. She contributedseveral excellent book reviews to the International Journal for Sex-Economy and Orgone-Research.27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954359éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Whatever her later difficulties with Reich, she never wavered in her conviction that he hadbeen a great innovator in the human disciplines. She took a more neutral position toward hisnatural-scientific research since she lacked the training and experience to evaluate theseinvestigations.For his part, Reich valued highly Meyer’s use of orgonomic findings in her ownwork, but was suspicious of her lack of a deeper commitment. An advantage of Meyer’sposition was that she was more disinterested—in the good sense of the word—than manyof his followers. She never gave off the odor of belonging to a “smelly little orthodoxy” (touse George Orwell’s phrase) as do so many “Reichians.” With her warm, judicious interestin the lives of others, she had a profound influence on hundreds of students, and she intro-duced some of them to the psychological and sociological aspects of orgonomy.Her position on the periphery of the orgonomic movements had its disadvantages,too. When Reich entered new domains, she could be more aware of his excesses than hiscontributions. Critical-minded intellectuals like Gladys Meyer often viewed Reich as anextremely creative but erratic person (child-peasant). With his keen emotional antennae,Reich would pick up the slightest hint of such an attitude and reject it. I recall once goingover some documents with Reich when I was in a critical mood toward him. He wrote a noteand passed it to me.The note read:“What is disturbing now? Yourfantasy ofmanagingme”—a comment that caught the exact quality of my critical attitude.But the main issue of controversy between Meyer and Reich concerned Wolfe.Around 1948, Reich began to feel that Meyer was undermining Theo’s relationship withReich and orgonomy. Wolfe had some of the same feeling. Meyer vigorously denied this.Wolfe suggested that she see Reich for further therapy to determine the truth, and Meyeragreed. During a number of sessions Reich and Meyer “waged a battle,” in her words. Meyerkept insisting she only wanted Theo to do what he wanted to do. In the end, Reich partlyaccepted Meyer’s explanation, but kept to himself his own interpretation7. Thereafter hewas much more distant toward her.Gladys Meyer may well have resented the extent of Theo’s involvement withorgonomy, although this feeling never went so far as Reich surmised. When I interviewedher, I said that Wolfe must have given a great deal of money to the Orgone Institute Press.Meyer said bitterly: “He [Reich] took every cent Wolfe had.” She then altered this statementto express the same idea but emphasizing that Wolfe wanted to help orgonomy whereverpossible.Still the resentment was there, all the more when Wolfe died in 1954, leaving herwith no sources of money other than her own income to support their young daughter. Norwas her bitterness mitigated by Reich’s total lack of concern for her financial plight. Evenafter Reich’s death he gave her cause for anger, since his will made no provision for theWolfe family to share in the royalties from Reich’s publications. According to Meyer, Reichand Wolfe had had an understanding that should orgonomic literature ever make money,they would share the proceeds.The seeds ofher later resentments may have been sown long before Wolfe’s death,in the years when she saw Wolfe so zealously devoting his energy and money to support theMyron SharafFury On Earth360éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"development of orgonomy. In many instances, the less involved mate resented the extent ofReich’s significance to a more involved partner. As Sigurd Hoel commented: “Reich wantedyour whole soul.”For his part, Wolfe’s withdrawal from orgonomy continued as his zeal faded. LoisWyvell took over the business aspects of the Press entirely. During the same year I wasresponsible for much of the editorial work Wolfe had previously done. So Reich had lessinterest in him as a colleague and adviser, although on important issues he still sought outWolfe’s counsel.In the summer of 1949, Wolfe was so depressed about his growing distance fromReich that he rarely left the cabin. Gladys worried, went to see Reich at the Students’Laboratory where he was working. At first, Reich was angry at the unexpected interruption.Gladys said firmly: “I’m sorry, but this is important.” So Reich sat down and talked with her.She expressed her concern about Wolfe. In one of his sudden moments of self-criticism,Reich said, “I worked with him too fast in therapy. I needed him as a worker so badly.” Andhe added: “Don’t undermine his critical ability. It is his best characteristic.”In these few sentences Reich delivered several messages to Wolfe and to GladysMeyer: How much Wolfe had meant to him as a colleague and how valuable his criticismwas (including,by implication, his criticism of Reich). He took some responsibility forTheo’s continuing personal problems. He also let Gladys Meyer know in a gentle way thathe still believed she had a capacity to undermine.Matters worsened when Wolfe, Baker, and Raphael visited Orgonon on February15, 1951, at the height of Oranur. According to Reich, Wolfe was “out of contact” with theexperiment; I do not know exactly what he meant by this description. But, as suggested ear-lier, one effect of Oranur may have been to exacerbate Reich’s jealousy. In any case, by earlyJune, when Ilse was recovering from her operation at the Baker home and Reich had begunhis affair with Lois Wyvell, his old suspicions about Ilse and Theo were rekindled. At Reich’sinstigation, part of Ilse’s therapy with Baker dealt with her feelings toward Wolfe8. Reichbegan badgering Wolfe about the matter, and Wolfe took up the issue with Baker9.Bakerand Wolfe had considerable respect for each other.Wolfe was understandably incensed that Reich would not accept his word that noaffair had taken place. And on June 7, he wrote Reich: “I gathered from your telephone call... that you still believe I did not tell the truth in January 1942 or that I am telling the truthnow ... I resent being called a liar ... and I am not going to be a scapegoat. Last but not least,I hate to see a fine woman driven toward her death because a man will not rid himself of agroundless,foolish idea. ...”Reich described Wolfe’s letter as “ugly and impertinent.” However, the missive,combined with Baker’s insistence that no affair had taken place, led Reich to retreat to alle-gations of Ilse’s “fantasies” about Wolfe. (Be this as it may, Baker’s defense of Reich’s out-rageous jealousy on the grounds that Ilse had “fantasies” toward this one or that one10would place us but a step from the “thought crimes” of1984.) Wolfe was to celebrate his forty-ninth birthday on September 2, and Gladys361éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"planned a party for him. Reich told workers at Orgonon not to attend. (This was the onlyinstance I know of where he issued an edict to his employees not to attend a social func-tion.) I no longer recall his reasons, but I remember—with shame—that I for one did notsay I would attend no matter what Reich’s feelings. In any case, we were spared a final testbecause Theo was so depressed by Reich’s attitude that Gladys called off the party11.The relationship between the two men must have improved somewhat becauseWolfe attended a business meeting at Orgonon in the late fall of 1951. On this occasion,Wolfe and Reich disagreed about a minor issue; to make matters worse, Ilse sided with Theo.The next day Reich called Wolfe in, bringing up the old allegations of an affair. That provedthe final straw. Wolfe resigned from the work on the spot, returning to Reich all the papershe still had in his possession12.In April 1952, Wolfe’s doctors discovered he had an advanced tuberculosis. He gaveup his practice and, without Gladys, went to New Mexico in an effort to recover. Bakerarranged for Wolfe’s patients to be transferred to other therapists and some of the fees tobe sent to Wolfe, who by this point had practically no financial resources.There is no evidence that Reich moved substantially to help Wolfe at any time afterthe latter finally left. When Wolfe wrote Reich from New Mexico asking if he, Theo, couldbe helpful in making atmospheric observations, Reich replied brusquely: Wolfe should dowhat he wanted to do and not be dependent upon him. A few weeks before Wolfe’s death,knowing that his illness was terminal and the end could come at any time, Theo again wroteReich and this time received a warm reply.About this time, too, an important relationship between Theo and a woman in NewMexico came to an end. In late July 1954 Wolfe was found dead by his friends, some pillsand a half-finished drink near him and a phonograph still playing. One speculation—certain-ly believed by Reich—was that Wolfe had committed suicide.Reich had endeavored to keep Wolfe actively engaged in the work; but once he sawthat Wolfe was no longer able to be fully involved, he, in effect, cut the strings. How can weunderstand such ruthless behavior toward a man who had done so much for orgonomy? Werecall that Reich had failed to visit his younger brother Robert when the latter was terminal-ly ill with tuberculosis (see Chapter 8).In Theo’s as well as in Robert’s case, Reich may wellhave felt guilty toward a person who had done so much to help him. Once again Reich han-dled guilt as he so often did, by throwing himself into his work and suppressing or repress-ing personal considerations. He had always been a man in a hurry, and now—hounded,ignored, but knowing that great discoveries still beckoned—he was in a relentless hurry.Furthermore, Reich was now suffering from a heart condition. He had no time for personswho withdrew from orgonomy.Wolfe had not only withdrawn. He had got caught up in Reich’s fantasies about ausurping man (tutor) and an unfaithful woman (mother). In Wolfe’s case, Reich’s competi-tiveness with male colleagues is revealed with special vividness. He could relate to men wellonly when they were clearly subordinate or when they were at a distance (Neill in Englandand Raknes in Norway). With more independent, nearby men, Reich’s fears of beingMyron SharafFury On Earth362éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"usurped got in the way.Put differently, the macho side of Reich led to an exaggerated and persistent stresson his preeminence in work and sex. In my view, this problem was connected with his unre-solved homoerotic feelings. I do not mean this only in the narrowly sexual sense, but in thelarger context of close, tender, at times dependent feelings toward men. Reich’s failure todeal with these themes led to their reemergence in distorted and destructive form. For exam-ple, jealous, groundless preoccupations often indicate a wish for the apparently feared event.The targets of Reich’s jealousy were frequently like Wolfe—handsome, clean-cut, non-Jewish—men different from Reich in ways that he with his acne had always envied. To sharea woman with such a man is to be closer to him, in a sense to be more like him.My interpretation is supported by the moralistic distaste Reich could express abouthomosexuality. Once in therapy I recall telling him about how an overture from a homosex-ual made me feel very uncomfortable. Reich replied proudly: “No homosexual has everapproached me. They don’t sense it in my structure.”At the time, I thought there was something wrong with me. Today, I am struck notonly by how untherapeutic Reich’s remark was, blocking as it did my further thoughts andfeelings on the subject, but even more by the reflection: Methinks he did protest too much! Reich’s behavior toward Wolfe can be understood, but it certainly cannot be con-doned. In a set of photos now displayed at the Orgonon Observatory, there is a picture ofWolfe with a caption supplied by Reich: “Victim of the emotional plague.” Reich undoubt-edly meant the emotional plague of others, not his own. But Wolfe was also the victim ofReich’s emotional plague.Concomitant with the Oranur experiment, Reich developed an interest in paintingduring the late spring of 1951. He painted very quickly, ten canvasses in his first two weeksof painting. Like the rest of his work, his artistic themes dealt with life, death, and nature.Ilse Ollendorffhas written:“His pictures have a very definite character, use brilliant colors,and I find them very fascinating not as great art but as a characteristic expression of the manReich.... There was much influence of Munch in color and choice of subjects.”13In a letter to Neill, Reich half-facetiously related his interest in painting to Oranur:“Ifart is a disease,Oranur has brought out the artist in me ... I just enjoy painting tremen-dously.”14It is noteworthy that Reich could allow himself so seemingly tangential a pastimeas painting under the tremendous stress of Oranur. But his “play” was closely related to thedevelopment of his work: Oranur required a careful eye for the details of the natural world,for the “sparkle”or “bleakness” of the atmosphere.Through his painting, Reich became more acutely aware of a unity between art andscience—in general and in himself in particular. The artist in him was evident at the begin-ning of a research enterprise, when he would permit the aesthetic, qualitative aspects ofwhat he dealt with (a patient, a bion, dots in the sky) to impress him. The scientist was man-ifest when he went on to conceptualize his observations and find ways to test his hypothe-ses. As he expressed it around the time he began to paint:27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954363éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Newton and Goethe are, with their respective world pictures, no longer asmuch antipodes as they used to be. Their points of view can and will be reconciled.The scientistand the artistare no longer keepers of two disparate, unmixable worlds,as they still seem to be. Intellect and intuition are no longer irreconcilable oppositesin scientific work. As a matter of fact, they have never been so in basic natural-sci-entific research15.In August 1951, the FDA renewed its investigation. A patient reported that an offi-cial had come to his home, taken a picture of the accumulator, and asked various questionsabout it16. Reich reacted sharply. He told accumulator users they were not legally obligatedto give the FDA any information. They should refer inspectors directly to his Foundation.(Irritated by its high legal fees, Reich had dropped the legal services of the Hays office inNew York.) Reich took the position that since orgone energy was neither a food, a drug, nora cosmetic, it lay beyond the FDA’s jurisdiction. On the other hand, he still offered to coop-erate with the FDA if it would proceed seriously, by studying the literature first, then seek-ing more information directly from the Foundation rather than from patients.In the battle between Reich and forces inimical to him, the accumulator was hismost vulnerable point. He had stated that the accumulator had certain preventive and cura-tive properties, however qualified his assertions. The FDA was mandated to protect the pub-lic against false medical claims. The Reich Foundation was renting accumulators to the pub-lic. With Reich having largely given up his private practice at the time of his move toOrgonon, the accumulator income became an important source of financial independence.The FDA flurry in 1951 was soon over, at least in manifestations Reich could dis-cern; however, the agency did confirm that it was continuing the investigation. Reich chosenot to regard this information seriously. As in 1948, he preferred to believe that the waningofsuch activity as visits to patients meant that the investigation itself was finished. Thisstrategy permitted him to turn his attention to other matters and lessened his anxiety.Unfortunately, it also prevented him from formulating a clear line of action in anticipationofa more formidable offensive.In October 1951,Reich suffered a major heart attack. At one point he experiencedtachycardia with a pulse rate of 150-16017.Reich himselfbelieved that Oranur had broughtout his specific physical vulnerability since he had previously suffered some tachycardia.He also attributed the attack to his use of an orgone energy funnel over his heartjust after he had experienced some mild discomfort. That he used the funnel at all reflectsthe ambiguity of his thinking. Reich posited that the radium had irritated orgone energy intoDOR,a reaction especially strong near orgone accumulators. He still maintained that theaccumulator could be helpful,though he did warn people against having any radioactive sub-stances, however minute, near the accumulator. Even at Orgonon he held open the possibil-ity the accumulator might help (although he was not certain of this) in the treatment of ill-ness when Oranur effects were not strong.Myron SharafFury On Earth364éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Reich was bedridden for four weeks. The heart attack exacerbated his depressionand anxiety over the disruption of his work, his upheavals with Ilse, and his general senseof things coming apart. Ilse Ollendorff has described the problems:... Although it was suggested by those physicians who were at Orgonon atthat time that he might be better taken care of in a hospital or that he should atleast have an oxygen tent at his disposal or that he should see a heart specialist heabsolutely refused, and insisted on curing himself with orgone therapy; but he gaveup smoking for good. I took care of him in the beginning, but he became increas-ingly suspicious of my good will and during the last two weeks of his convalescencehad his daughter Eva come back to take care of him18.On November 12, Ilse wrote Dr. Baker:He [Reich] is so terrifically sensitive to the least irrationality that it seemsalmost unavoidable that one of us here gets him upset. If it is not me, it is Tropp,or Mickey [Sharaf ], or Grethe or Lois or Tom or Eva, or Peter or the radio, andyou cannot keep him completely isolated. ... He fluctuates very much betweenwanting to die, not wanting to die and being afraid of dying, and it is impossible topretend anything to him or to have “bedside manners.” I think that he and Dr.Tropp have decided that his sickness could be diagnosed in classical terms asmyocarditis which, according to Tropp, has a very hopeful prognosis, if we can justmanage to keep him quiet and resting.Reich’s refusal to see a heart specialist reflected his long-held suspicion of classicalmedicine. But his giving up cigarettes was a big step. He had smoked all his adult life, at leastsince the Army period. His cigarettes were as dear to him as cigars were to Freud, but clear-ly his heavy smoking had taken its toll.During the period I knew him,he suffered from aracking cough that at times was like a seizure; one became afraid he would pass out. In thedays following his decision to quit, someone asked him if it was hard to stop. He simplyreplied: “I have considerable self-discipline when I want to exert it.”19The growing tension between Reich and Ilse was reflected in his decision to haveEva visit Orgonon and care for him during the last weeks or so of his illness. In the springof 1951 she returned to Maine along with her lover, William Moise, a painter, teacher, andstudent oforgonomy. Sometimes living in Rangeley, sometimes in Hancock, Maine (somefour hours from Orgonon), Eva and Bill were both to participate in diverse aspects ofReich’s work and remain close to him until the end of his life.The friction between Reich and Eva continued. Eva had many qualities in commonwith her father—she was lively, open, domineering, and brilliant, with an intuitive as well asscientific flair for orgonomy. Unlike her father, she could also be scattered, confused, andprovocative. She knew exactly how to irritate him, for example, by indulging her penchant27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954365éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"for certain mystical notions. As his daughter, she had more leeway from Reich than others,but sometimes he would be mercilessly hard on her. They engaged in frequent battles, trig-gered at times by his heavy hand. For example, at one point she strongly resented his for-bidding her to see her mother. He believed this was a necessary antidote to the years whenshe had been pressured by her mother’s circle not to see Reich. She felt that Reich’s step wasdictatorial Later, she very much regretted that she had yielded to his influence, just as sheregretted submitting earlier to the influence against him. In one sense, she never entirely losther feeling of being torn apart by these opposing forces20.By mid-November, Reich was on his feet and back at work. I saw no sign of anyreduced work schedule once he recovered. Indeed, his heart attack seemed to add to hisurgency about eliminating the Oranur reaction at Orgonon and bringing his affairs in order.He also mentioned at the time that he thought many heart attacks stemmed from heart-break.Throughout the winter of 1951-52, the effects of Oranur persisted. TheObservatory was only usable for brief periods of time and the Students’ Laboratory wasclosed. I worked in my apartment in Rangeley. By March of 1952, Peter and Ilse had movedto a small apartment in Rangeley. Reich stayed sometimes at the Observatory, sometimes ata motel or with Ilse.For several weeks the three lived together again in Dr. Tropp’s home inRangeley when Tropp and his family left for a vacation.There was a grimness and restlessness about Reich in those days. I recall his com-ing into my apartment and being annoyed that the windows weren’t open. His commentswere often uncommonly curt; he appeared more easily angered than ever.Yet, however embroiled Reich was with Oranur and its unsettling effects on hisexistence, his work proceeded. Several major publications were prepared in 1951, the con-tents of which will be discussed shortly. The Orgone Energy Bulletincontinued to appear.Although Reich had transferred considerable responsibility for the training of physicians toBaker, he never lost his zealous concern for what was happening to his work, the possibleruination ofwhich by followers as well as enemies was a constant fear. For instance, in 1951certain examples of“cocktail orgone therapy” occurred, in which some therapists at socialgatherings made inappropriate interpretations to strangers about, say, their orgastic potencyor their body armor.Reich was furious and said that such behavior betrayed a complete lackof contact with the spirit of orgonomy.While Reich was plunging forward into new domains through the Oranur experi-ment, he was also moving backward to survey the body of his work in its entirety. He con-ceived of publishing a series of volumes to present the essential documentary material onall phases ofhis life and work. Reich had a deep and abiding fear of distortion of the his-torical record, a fear that his work and name would somehow be slandered and defamed, notjust currently but into posterity. Also, he was increasingly impressed by the unity of his workand he wanted to have its different phases ordered in such a way as to reveal this unity andto reflect the historical perspective. And, as he commented at the time, he did not quite trusthimself to make the right interpretations because of his emotional involvement in every-Myron SharafFury On Earth366éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"thing that had occurred. For all these reasons, he wanted to have complete, accurate docu-ments for later historians to study—historians he fervently hoped would be objective in theiranalysis.During late 1951 and early 1952, I spent considerable time helping Reich to orderhis material. He was a very careful archivist and did a great deal of painstaking work in set-ting up the cataloguing system for his papers. Sometimes when he was carefully pressing outa crumpled newspaper article from the 1930s or pasting up material, he would say with atouch of irony: “When I retire, I can at least get a job at the Library of Congress.” Historicalwork often brought out a mellow, musing side in him. His references to Freud were frequent,especially when he went over the documents from the psychoanalytic years. He was still verypleased by the warmth of some of Freud’s letters to him.Some documents from Reich’s Marxist period made him wince, as he reread radi-cal political utterances in his letters and publications with which he now violently disagreed.But he insisted that however much he would love to tear some of them up, all must remainunchanged as part of the historical record. If his emotions grew too strong, he would dic-tate a note under the heading, “Silent Observer,” which recorded his present-day observa-tions about the material.From the historical material Reich published only one volume,People in Trouble(1953). This work, which was mainly written in the 1930s and deals largely with Reich’s socialconcepts, was described in Chapter n. During 1950 and 1951, I translated the manuscriptfrom the German and Reich added to it in English many of his “Silent Observer” com-ments. I can thus vouch for the fact that he did not delete a line or change a phrase fromthe German material, much as he may have liked to downplay his participation in theCommunist Party.Oranur and the revived FDA investigation soon overwhelmed Reich’s time andenergies, but he did have the chance to put in order most of his archival material. I remem-ber his wanting to get in touch with Harvard University with an eye to their storing his doc-uments. I thought there was little likelihood of Harvard’s being interested. Perhaps my judg-ment was correct at the time.Today, his papers are in the Countway Library of HarvardMedical School,Although The Murder ofChristwas not published until 1953,it was written duringthe summer of1951 at the height of the Oranur reaction. Reich had long been interested inthe Christ story, noting in 1948 when he wrote Ether, God and Devil: “It remains to be inves-tigated from where the Christ legend draws its greatness, its emotional force, and itsendurance.”21Oranur jolted Reich into giving his version of this “legend” one he had beenpreparing over the years by reading all the major books on Christ and his times that he couldfind.The Murder of Christwas a long time in gestation, but Reich actually wrote it in a fewmonths. Oranur had impressed him as never before with the power of evil: evil in man andevil in nature.Now he felt a special urgency to tell the quintessential story of human eviland tell it quickly.27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954367éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"The Murder of Christwas not primarily a historical study. In his characteristic way,Reich utilizes the Jesus story—the parables, the gospel narratives, the historical informa-tion—to make his own points. At the same time, he writes with the conviction that much ofwhat he describes was actually experienced by the historical Christ, his followers, and hisenemies. Reich does not utilize the kind of ironic, distancing device Freud employed whenhe introduced as a “Just So” story his seriously held hypothesis that a patricide and its seque-lae formed the origin of civilization. Reich was writing chiefly in a prophetic vein. Read oneway, the combination of historical and prophetic modes of discourse weaken each other: thereader wonders how true the history is and receives no careful answers; he also wonderswhat the allegorical digressions have to do with the history of Jesus. Read another way, thecombination enhances both elements: the Christ story is illuminated by Reich’s concepts,while the latter was vivified by their embodiment in the life and death of Jesus. Reich’s proseis concordant with his aims. It is forceful, incantatory, alive, and simple. As in Listen, LittleMan!, he was also at times repetitious, frenzied, and self-pitying. Withal, it stands as a fineexample of the best of his late writings, wherein he dropped his academic garb and showed,in Yeats’s phrase, “there’s more enterprise in walking naked.”Reich took Christ as the supreme example of unarmored life. His is a Christ wholoves children,forgives sinners, and has healing powers. Christ can heal because he has astrong energy field capable of exciting the sluggish, “dead” energy systems of the wretched.Most controversially, Reich’s Christ is a lover of women, as evinced by their devotion to himand by such remarks as: “Let him who is free of sin cast the first stone.” The sex-repressiveside of Christianity Reich ascribed to Jesus’ rational dislike of pornography and to a rigidi-fication of this notion by Saint Paul. For Reich, Saint Paul, the organizer, was to Christ whatStalin was to Marx—the distorter of the original truth.Reich dealt with the diverse roles and motivations played by Judas, Pontius Pilate,and the Pharisees in the murder of Christ. But, basically, he indicted armored man. Averagemen and women flock to Christ in expectation of a miraculous deliverance from theirarmor. When he cannot rescue them in the way they expect, they turn against him. If theydo not lead the crucifixion,they do not stop it—indeed,they support it. In turn, Christ isdisappointed in the people, even his closest disciples. Reich quotes Christ citing Isaiah inwhat amounts to a description ofthe armor:You shall indeed hear but never understand,and you shall indeed see but never perceive.For this people’s heart has grown dull,and their ears are heavy ofhearing,and their eyes have been closed.For Reich, the murder of Christ goes on continually. Every child is Christ, its spon-taneity and genuine curiosity deadened by destructive familial and social practices. Everyadult who somehow manages to preserve his or her liveliness and who has also the talent toMyron SharafFury On Earth368éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"produce works that challenge man’s immobility risks sharing Christ’s fate. In ErnestHemingways’s words: “If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to killthem to break them, so of course it kills them. ... It kills the very good and the very gentleand the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you toobut there will be no special hurry.”22Thus, Christ is the most vivid example of the murder of the living. Moving freelythrough history, Reich cites instances everywhere. Giordano Bruno, burned at the stake bythe Inquisition, becomes a poignant example. Reich sees himself as another, and reviews thepersecution he has suffered from “the people” as well as from various “orthodoxies.” At thetime of writing The Murder of Christ, Reich felt hunted by the Food and Drug Administration,increasingly misunderstood by and isolated from even his closest followers. In my view, heknew somehow that he was facing his own awareness saturates the book, giving it a haunt-ing power.Reich’s bold self-references together with discussions of the historical Christ haveled to the mistaken conclusion that Reich identified with him in a literal, psychotic fashion.Such a diagnosis does not so much miss the point as collide with it, to use a phrase the crit-ic John Leonard employed in another context. Of course, Reich “identified” with Christ ifChrist represented the unimpeded flow of life—precisely the point Reich was trying tomake.Reich’s most tragic conclusion is that the killing of Christ and of orgonomy, if notby literal murder then by silence, made sense from the viewpoint of armored man. He can-not live in the way that Christ and orgonomy represent. More, the existence of such a liferepresents the unbearable provocation of being desirable but unattainable. If armored peo-ple try to make contact with the teachings of Christ or orgonomy, there is the danger thatthey will act out secondary, destructive impulses. Conservatives in whatever guise have apoint when they call for ‘law and order” against the messianic message. As Reich put it:The human race would meet with the worst,the most devastating disasterifit obtained full knowledge of the life function, of the orgasm function or of thesecret of the murder of Christ with one stroke as a whole. There is very good rea-son and sound rationality in the fact that the human race has refused to acknowl-edge the depth and the true dynamics of its chronic misery. Such a sudden break-ing in ofknowledge would incapacitate and destroy everything that still somehowkeeps society going23.Reich’s grim realism here is akin to that of Dostoevski’s Grand Inquisitor in TheBrothers Karamazov. The Inquisitor tells the reincarnated Christ that he erred in offering mantruth and freedom. “By showing him so much respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to feelfor him, for Thou didst ask too much from him. ... Respecting him less Thou wouldst haveasked less ofhim.That would have been more like love, for his burden would have beenlighter, He is weak and vile.” In seeking freedom, men are like “little children rioting. ...27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954369éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"Though they are rebels, they are impotent rebels unable to keep up their own rebellion.”24They will gratefully submit to the authoritarian Church, which understands their need fordomination. So the living Christ must die again to protect the people from those aspects ofhis teachings they cannot live.Reich mainly differs from the Inquisitor in that he sees man’s “vileness” as mutable,even if the change requires centuries.I have one major objection to The Murder of Christ. Reich does justice to himself asan example of how life is murdered, but he gives insufficient due to the ways he himselfcould murder life. In some of his earlier publications, usually written during periods of rel-ative peace and success, he frankly acknowledged his own emotional plague, making it clearthat he, too, was a child of this authoritarian civilization, that he could be as destructive asthe next person. Now, under attack, he defensively omits such references, though in privateconversation he occasionally revealed this aspect of his self-awareness.My other criticism concerns not the book per se but Reich’s failure to apply in hislife the very lesson that saturates the book, namely, the deep rationale for the world’s avoid-ance of orgonomy. Right around the time Reich was writing The Murder of Christ, he was alsovery intent on arousing the government’s interest in the Oranur experiment. Reich sentcopies ofhis Oranur Report,which appeared in October 1951, to many governmental agen-cies. Naively he interpreted their polite thank-you notes as genuine interest. After his detaileddescription of the fear of the living, how could he conceivably imagine that governmentofficials would look objectively at Oranur, a comprehension of which was exactly what offi-cials and the average citizen feared with a terror no one described better than Reich? Thereinlies the enduring paradox: Reich keeps describing why everyone must fear his work, all thewhile believing that somecircle—the Communists in the 1930s or parts of the American gov-ernment in the 1950s—will appreciate his discoveries.Reich blamed Christ’s followers for seducing him into the ride into Jerusalem on anass. No one but he himself seduced Reich into seeking Washington’s support. Indeed, hehoped,figuratively, to march on Washington with Oranur in his fist, confounding his ene-mies at last in one dramatic showdown. Reich rationalized the urgency with which heapproached the government on the basis of the threat of a nuclear war as well as the pos-sible wide-ranging effects of Oranur itself. However, he was untrue to his basic principle ofletting the world come to him. With the exception of his approach to Einstein, Reich hadwaited patiently during the 1940s. In 1951, time was running out. Driven into a corner bymounting opposition, he wanted to strike back with everything at hand. He deluded himselfthat one of his assets was possible support in high places if he could just get the “truth” tothe right people.The year 1951 also saw the publication ofCosmic Superimposition.People in Trouble,TheOranur Report, and The Murder of Christwere all loaded with emotion, and often angry emo-tion. Cosmic Superimposition, on the other hand, was a very quiet book, reflecting a lovingattentiveness to natural phenomena. Here Reich was primarily concerned with the complexrelationship between energy and mass. Starting with the Superimposition of two organismsMyron SharafFury On Earth370éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"(or energy systems) in the sexual embrace, he moved to the Superimposition of two orgoneenergy particles in the formation of matter. The work included theoretical formulations onthe development of galaxies, hurricanes, and the aurora borealis.Although the bulk of the book dealt with very technical material, Reich finishedwith a more accessible chapter on “The Rooting of Reason in Nature.” Among other things,he dealt with a problem of long-standing concern: the question of the origin of man’sarmoring. Reich did not attempt to solve the problem of how the armor developed. Rather,he recast the problem. Earlier, consistent with a Marxist interpretation of human history, hehad seen the armoring as secondary to socioeconomic influences, especially the hypothe-sized shift in early human history from matriarchal to patriarchal forms of social existence.Now he changed the sequence: “The process of armoring, most likely, was there first, andthe socio-economic processes which today and throughout written history have reproducedarmored man, were already the first important results of the biological aberration ofman.”25Reich went on to speculate that man’s reasoning, especially in the form of self-awareness, triggered the development of this armor:In thinking about his own being and functioning, man turned involuntarily against him-self; not in a destructive fashion, but in a manner which may well have been thepoint of origin of his armoring. ...Man somehow became frightened and for the first timein the history of his species began to armor against the inner fright and amazement. Just as inthe well-known fable, the milliped could not move a leg and became paralyzedwhen he ... started thinking about which leg he put first and which second, it is quitepossible that the turning of reasoning toward itself induced the first emotionalblocking in man. It is impossible to say what perpetuated this blocking of emotionsand with it the loss oforganismic unity and “paradise.”26It is fascinating here to see Reich come close to the Freudian thinking that postu-lated a “mute hostility” between ego and id. The ego feared being overwhelmed by the idand must needs defend against it in order to carry out the tasks of reasoning and self-aware-ness. But and the “but” is importantReich never saw the split between ego and id asinevitable. The few people who were able to maintain the unity of sensation and reason (forReich, they were the great artists and scientists) provided examples of a way out of thedilemma: “It would become possible, by the most strenuous effort ever made in the historyofman,to adjust the majority to the flow of natural processes. Then if our exposition ofthe armoring blocking is correct, man could return home to nature; and what appears todayas exceptional in a very few could become the rule for all.”27Supported by the knowledge of orgone energy, man could use his reason to makebetter contact with his depths, his deep emotions, his currents of pleasure. The split Reichhypothesized as occurring when man began to be aware of himself could be overcome.27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954371éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Toward the end of 1951, as Reich was preparing source material for the history oforgonomy, he read a notice that the Freud Archives were gathering all available material per-tinent to Freud’s life and work. Reich wrote offering his cooperation. In his reply, KurtEissler, then secretary of the archives, either suggested or agreed to an interview with Reichat Orgonon about Freud and psychoanalysis.The interview occurred in two sessions, each lasting several hours, on October 18and 19, 1952. Everything about it was extraordinary: what Reich said, the context withinwhich it was held (the Oranur emergency), Eissler’s responses, and the way it was subse-quently published.For Reich, the interview served several purposes. It was an opportunity to set downfor the historical record—for the Freud Archives, for his own archives, and for possible pub-lication—his convictions about Freud’s contributions, errors, and personal qualities. Moreimportant, it gave him a chance to delineate once more one of his constant preoccupations,the relationship between psychoanalysis and orgonomy. Underlying Reich’s preparations forthe whole interview was a deep concern that rumors and slander in psychoanalytic circlesabout his work and person would enter the historical record uncorrected.In the course of the interview, Reich paid eloquent tribute to what he consideredthe essential tenets ofpsychoanalysis:the unconscious, infantile sexuality, resistance, actualneurosis, libido theory. He also discussed at some length the possible personal and social rea-sons for Freud’s rejection of Reich’s basic concepts, especially the orgasm theory. He offereda variety of explanations, including the efforts of Federn and Jones to influence Freudagainst Reich. He also stressed Freud’s marital unhappiness as a factor: “There is very littledoubt that he was very much dissatisfied genitally. ... He had to give up his personal pleas-ures, his personal delights in his middle years.”28Reich was, I believe, the first person to focus on the influence of Freud’s own mar-riage on the development of his work. Since the interview, much material has appeared,especially the Freud- Jung correspondence, highlighting Freud’s marital unhappiness. In hismassive biography, the discreet Ernest Jones barely hints at this.However, it was not with Freud that Reich was primarily concerned. Rather, it waswith the way he, Reich, had developed certain aspects of Freudian thought. Again and againduring the interview he explained his own ideas about the nature of streamings, and the wayhis concepts continued but differed from Freud’s, as well as the reception they received fromFreud and other analysts. Ranging even more widely, Reich talked about the fate of bio-ener-gy in infants when contact with the mother was disturbed. Eissler patiently waited out hissubject’s excursions, trying to lead Reich back to Freud. Reich wove in and out of Freud,psychoanalysis during the 1920s, and his own particular themes. Always he emphasized thecrucial significance of his own work, no matter what the analysts thought of it this at a timewhen the psychoanalytic establishment was more powerful than it had ever been or wouldbe in subsequent decades.Part ofReich was concerned with the analysts’ reactions to his work and naivelyyearned for their goodwill, in spite of all the prevailing evidence. Old feelings of cama-Myron SharafFury On Earth372éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"raderie still existed, old wounds still hurt him. When Eissler mentioned that he had discussedhis interviewing Reich with Heinz Hartmann and Arthur Kronold (a student of Reich’s inVienna), both of whom Reich had known quite well, Reich was clearly disappointed to learnthat their interest in the interview was peripheral29.Reich was misled by Eissler’s interviewing technique, his “fascinatings,” and “goons.” He believed Eissler was far more receptive to his work than in fact was the case.Indeed, Eissler was secretly laughing at Reich a good deal of the time. When I interviewedEissler about the Freud interview, he assumed I was most interested in what diagnosis ofmental illness should be ascribed to Reich. He did not think Reich was schizophrenic, butpsychopathic with underlying paranoid trends. He added that his colleagues believed thatEissler himself tended to underestimate pathology30.Eissler had not meant the interview to be published soon since it was intended forthe Freud Archives, which were to be sealed for many years. Nor did he want it to be pub-lished, fearing embarrassment when some analysts read Reich’s astringent comments aboutthem, with Eissler’s ambiguous asides of “fascinating.” However, in 1967, Mary Higginspublished this interview, a transcript of which was in the Reich Archives. In so doing shewas following Reich’s own wishes, or at least one expression of them, for in 1954 he wrote:“It is of crucial importance ... that the major, factual parts of the Wilhelm Reich interviewon Freud be published now.”31Eissler’s interview was not in fact Reich’s last word about Freud. In 1956, on theanniversary of Freud’s one hundredth birthday, Baker requested an article from Reich for hisjournal,Orgonomic Medicine. Reich’s response was a paper relating his DOR research toFreud’s concept of the death instinct. Although Reich firmly believed that his work onorgone energy was quite distinct from psychoanalysis, and although he had always been andstill was in strong opposition to death instinct theory, Reich saw certain connections betweenFreud’s ideas and what he conceptualized as DOR32.I find it extremely moving and poignant that in what would prove to be his last the-oretical paper, Reich should make connections between his work and that of Freud. Reichhad been deeply hurt by Freud, and the death instinct controversy had led ultimately toReich’s expulsion from the International Psychoanalytic Association. In early 1956, Reichwas facing a trial for contempt of an FDA injunction. Psychoanalytic organizations, alongwith other groups, had encouraged the FDA to get rid of Reich’s work. Nonetheless, Reichcould see where Freud was right in his thinking about a death instinct, although Reich neveragreed with the concept itself.In his last years, the superficial, irrational Reich was separating himself from moreand more people. However, during the same years the deep, rational Reich was making moreprofound connections with the concepts of others than he ever had in the past. Reich wasnot only putting his papers in order, he was putting his thoughts in order. The symphonicstructure of his work had as its basic themes the liberation of life energy in man and theharnessing of atmospheric orgone energy to help man. Now he was adding more fully thanever the counter-themes, or what he called “the obstacles in the way” to the unfolding of27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954373éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"life. While continuing with the Oranur experiment, he was using the fruits of that researchas well as other findings to appreciate more fully the partial truths in conservative views hehad long opposed: Freud’s death instinct theory; Freud’s emphasis on the difficulties in inte-grating self-awareness and self-control with full emotional experiencing of the self; the reli-gious emphasis on the tenacity of man’s evil; the political conservative’s stress on the dan-gers of too rapid social change; and the rationality in avoidance of orgonomy.At the same time, Reich never lost sight of the radical aspects of his own work. Hedid not mechanically add old insights, but rather reinterpreted them. The new connectionsfound their orderly passages within his scientific music. In the sharpness and originality withwhich he formulated questions about man’s present illness and potential health, in the passionand courage with which he sought answers to these questions, in the combination of his atten-tion to detail and his power of comprehensive generalization, his final work stands unsur-passed. Reich’s ultimate legacies to those who followed were the most careful guideposts notonly to the potentials but also to the perils of the orgonomic journey. It was an awesomeachievement, especially from a man so severely beset from without and from within.Oranur certainly marked a new beginning, and with it a burst of destructive rage inReich’s personal life. For Reich, new beginnings usually entailed new co-workers and oftena new geographical location. Surrounded by disapproving Viennese colleagues in the late1920s, he moved to Berlin, where he found more receptive associates. His relationship withElsa Lindenberg speeded the end of his increasingly unhappy marriage to Annie. When thesituation became strained in Berlin, Hitler’s advent to power in 1933 forced his departure forScandinavia, where again he could match his developing interests in muscular armor and inthe bions with a supportive, if not always fully comprehending, network of colleagues. Hiswork continued to advance in Oslo; when the attacks developed against him and his rela-tionship with Elsa had deteriorated, he could emigrate to the United States to begin a newsocial and scientific existence.And when life in New York with its responsibilities for ther-apy and training distracted him from natural-scientific research, he could move to Orgonon,which permitted an almost exclusive devotion to basic investigations.But when upheavals started at Orgonon, there was nowhere to turn. He often saidto me and to others,“You can go back”—meaning we could pursue other ways of life—“Ihave burned my bridges.” There was no going back for him. More, the very few people atOrgonon provided little opportunity for human warmth and companionship when his rela-tionship with Ilse deteriorated so markedly. Where he did reach out, as with Lois Wyvell, thesmalltown gossip in Rangeley added to his sense of strain and bondage.During these years his relationship with Ilse continued,though with greater emo-tional distance between them. In the fall of 1952, Ilse and Peter moved into a small housein Rangeley, while Reich tried to live at Orgonon when the atmosphere permitted him to doso.But a final separation was not easy. The ties between them were strong, they had a childin common to whom Reich was devoted, they had work in common. Again rather typically,Reich made the focal issue Ilse’s difficulty in following Oranur developments, especially theMyron SharafFury On Earth374éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"cloud-busting operations. As with Annie, he could not simply end a relationship he nolonger wanted.Thus, almost from the start of Oranur in January 1951 through the time when shefinally left Orgonon in the summer of 1954, Reich waged his battle with Ilse, interspersedwith periods of peace. In her biography, Ms. Ollendorff has rendered well the negative sidesof Reich during that period—his jealous rages, his insistence on people following his ideas,his taking it out on those near him when the outside attacks mounted. She has also accurate-ly portrayed the positive aspects of her own behavior at the time: her admirable refusal notto agree about matters she sincerely could not understand, her efforts to work things out,her concern for their son, Peter, and above all her sheer endurance under the most difficultof circumstances.But what is missing from her account is any really deep appreciation of what Reichwas going through, his positive qualities during this period and her negative ones. She argues,for example, that one of the reasons she eventually left Reich was that she could not followsuch convictions as that “Red Fascists” were behind this or that attack, or that he had pow-erful friends in high governmental places. Although retrospectively she acknowledges thathe may have been on to something with his cloud-busting work, she attributes any failure onher part to grasp this or other valid aspects ofhis later work to her limited scientific knowl-edge or talent. Nowhere does she acknowledge irrational emotional factors within herselfthat inevitably aroused Reich’s wrath.Given Ilse’s blind spots, why, then, did Reich fight so hard and often so unfairly toforce her into awareness? Why did he extract written, Stalinist-like confessions of her fearand hatred of him? Why on the day of their final separation in August 1954 did he stillaccuse her of protecting the now dead Wolfe instead of admitting to an affair? Why at thistime did he hit her in front of their ten-year-old son Peter? And why did he strike her onseveral other occasions, once with such force that he punctured her eardrum?33In his jealous rages, his violence, his bullying, his demand for confessions, Reichwas under the spell of,and identified with,his introjected father. Leon had behaved exactlythe same way toward Cecilia as Reich was now treating Ilse. The young Willy had been pres-ent at some of these scenes between Leon and Cecilia, just as Peter was witness to some ofReich’s more outrageous explosions against Ilse. And, given Reich’s own guilt over his moth-er’s suicide, one can understand how hard it was for Reich to separate from a woman towhom he had been deeply attached and to whom he owed so much. He had a way of forc-ing the issues—and making a principle out of the separation in the name of his work—sothat the woman ultimately left him. At least in her version of events, Annie decided that shecould no longer remain married to Reich. Gerd decided she could not retreat to theNorwegian mountains. Elsa decided she could not go to America. Ilse decided to leaveOrgonon. But in another sense, Reich forced each of these separations through his ownbehavior.Reich was also behaving as the boy Willy had done, eager to win the mother, feel-ing betrayed and put down by her when she took the tutor (as earlier she had taken the hus-27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954375éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"band). He would prove that he could win her. In many of Reich’s relationships with womenthere was a tremendous battle quality. He just had to make them see he was on the righttrack, had to win their total admiration. And this urgency grew virulently compulsive whenhe had taken a new, insecure step in his life’s work.I find it significant that all the women I interviewed or corresponded with who hadrelationships with Reich attributed their difficulties with him to his problems, social difficul-ties, or their lack of scientific knowledge and skill. None focussed on their emotional prob-lems with him. One can speculate that this denial was also shared by his mother with regardto Leon; all the difficulties were his fault, just as he entirely blamed her until her suicide. Inthis respect at least, Reich chose women like his mother in an effort to make it come outright this time. It never did.Thus, Reich remained locked in repetitions of his past, even as he transcendedthem in his ever grander work. Or transmuted them is perhaps the better term. For the“excess” from his personal problems and compulsions undoubtedly contributed to the pas-sion of his scientific comprehension.The obverse is also true. By channeling so much irrational rage and groundless sus-picion into his personal relations and into some distorted, paranoid explanations of animos-ity against his work,Reich was free to direct an almost unblemished magnaminity toward hisgreat scientific and human themes. As petty as his grudges against Ilse and Theo, as largewas his generosity toward Freud, who in fact had “betrayed” him far more than Ilse or Wolfeever did.How much was Reich aware of his past as an irrational influence on his actions andbeliefs during his last years? I do not know. Once he said to Lois Wyvell: “I fear your moth-er in you just as I fear my father in me,” but he did not expand on that awareness, nor in hislater years did he ever criticize his mother, to my knowledge. During this period the only per-son who suggested the possible role of his family dynamics was Ola Raknes in a letter toReich.In reply, Reich quickly and without getting angry dismissed Raknes’s tentative andsensitively worded interpretation.One old friend suggested he needed help.Lia Laszky visited Orgonon in 1953 or1954.Reading some of his publications in the 1950s, she had become worried about hisemotional state.With some psychoanalytic colleagues from New York she went up toOrgonon. Reich would not see them, but he did agree to see Lia, who went up to the Observatory by herself She said to him: “Willy, inthe name ofour old friendship and love, get help for yourself!” At first Reich was angry, butthen he said: “Whom could I go to?” as if he were just barely considering the idea. Liareplied:“I wouldn’t even have mentioned it if I hadn’t someone in mind who I think isgood.” She suggested Harry Guntrip, a teacher of hers and a highly respected therapist34.Nothing came of her suggestion. Reich could not see anyone unless he felt that per-son knew where he was right as well as wrong. There was no such person, though Reich didyearn for someone to whom he could speak with full candor. He once said: “People cancome to me with their problems but I have no one to talk to.”Myron SharafFury On Earth376éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"In May 1952, 1 left Orgonon. My explanation at the time for leaving was that Iwanted to continue my academic education, and my lack of scientific training hindered myusefulness now that Oranur was so much at the center of the work. These reasons obtained,but of equal importance was the fact that my own relationship with Reich had deteriorated.I was not so open with him as earlier and his behavior toward fearfulness was not helpful,resulting in the destructive interaction described in Chapter 2.Reich and I parted amicably. I remember waving good-bye to him from my car ashe was working—I undoubtedly thought “fiddling”—with his cloudbuster pipes outside theStudents’ Laboratory. He gave me a hard look, hurt, angry, yet not unfriendly, as if to say:What about all those fine words and ideals of yours now? Did you really mean them? It is fashionable to describe Reich as a difficult, even impossible man in his lastyears. That is Ilse OllendorfFs point in her biography, and in one sense it was true. For partof Reich was a bully and he reacted in the same way as he once described the police: Lookthem in the eye and they leave you alone; hide and they club you. Once one hid, Reich wasmerciless in his accusations, his rages, his demands for various acknowledgments that wentfar beyond actual deeds.However, I like to think that if I had dealt with Reich more openly and courageous-ly,with a deeper awareness of what he was about, he would have taken criticism with muchbetter grace. In my experience, no one did what I have in mind. Basically, people either wentalong or they left.Helen MacDonald and Lee Wylie had already left Orgonon. Lois Wyvell stayed onanother year after me, but her intimate relationship with Reich was increasingly difficult. Hewas still devoting considerable energy to resolving his relationship with Ilse and had becomemore despairing about his loneliness. The winter of 1952-53 was particularly painful. TheTropps took a long vacation; Eva spent considerable time in Hancock. Of the original groupthat had moved to Rangeley with such bright hopes in 1950, only Lois and Ilse remained.Ilse was out ofcontact with Oranur and Lois was professionally engaged only with mattersconcerning the Press. On occasion, Reich would say: “I have no one.” Lois would reply:“You have Dr.Baker,” and Reich would very tentatively say: “Yes.” Baker and other physi-cians gave what support they could, but none of them was actively engaged in scientificwork in general or Oranur in particular. At a more personal level, Reich felt really close onlyto Peter. On some occasions, Reich would cry and indicate his need to be held and comfort-ed. Thus by late winter, the combination of Reich’s involvement with Ilse and his generaldespair corroded whatever satisfaction there had been between Lois and him, and the rela-tionship ended.During the spring of1953,Lois Wyvell became involved with another man, a per-son who spent some time in Rangeley. Reich, jealous, felt that the man was using his con-nection with Lois to try to obtain work at Orgonon or otherwise involve himself in orgon-omy. (Reich frequently felt, sometimes correctly, sometimes incorrectly, that people woulduse his assistants to inveigle something from him.) However, he also acknowledged his ownirrational destructive emotions. With some astonishment about his own jealous feelings, he27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954377éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"said: “I, too, am sometimes capable of the murder of Christ.”35Since her friend could not find work in Rangeley, Lois decided to move toFarmington, a larger city forty miles away. She planned to continue working for Reich, butReich decided to terminate her employment. Speechless with disappointment and rage, heexperienced the throat block he had described in his very first clinical paper—his disguisedautobiography. He wrote a note: “You are fired!” Soon after Lois Wyvell left Rangeley in thebeginning of July, Reich’s stand toward both her and her friend softened. At a later time thequestion of her working for him again was considered, but this plan never materialized.Simeon Tropp had been mainly a consultant and friend to Reich in Rangeley. Hewas one of the few colleagues with whom Reich would share leisure time—have meals andgo to the movies. Reich always appreciated Simeon’s warmth, his mischievous humor, andhelpfulness. He was also fond of Tropp’s wife, Helen, who worked for Reich as a secretaryfor a period. However, Reich became more and more irritated by Tropp’s impulsive think-ing and his inability to do consistent work. Moreover, he felt that both Helen and Simeonwere adversely affected by Oranur. Helen showed certain precancerous symptoms, symp-toms Reich believed Tropp did not take with sufficient seriousness. Simeon himself experi-enced a recurrence of an old liver ailment. Tired of the stress at Orgonon, the long winters,and the Oranur effects, the Tropps left. They settled on Long Island, New York, in the earlyfall of 1954.*In August 1954, Ilse Ollendorff left Orgonon to work at the Hamilton School inSheffield, Massachusetts. The school was run by two students of Reich, Alexander andEleanor Hamilton.By 1954, Tom Ross had moved closer to Reich than ever. For Reich, Tom repre-sented an oasis of simple trust in a desert of loneliness. Reich’s deep respect for him, togeth-er with his independent status as a workman rather than a disciple, spared him Reich’s ragesand spared Reich any exalted expectations from Tom.A new assistant had joined Reich in the spring of 1953. Robert McCullough, a biol-ogist,originally from Utah,had long been interested in Reich’s work, especially in its biolog-ical and physical aspects.Bob was a very serious, modest person, devoted to science. He hadalready worked for a year in the biology department of the University of New Hampshire,with periodic visits to Reich in Orgonon. Then Reich offered him a full-time position at abetter salary than the university provided, an offer McCullough happily accepted36.In an article entitled “The Rocky Road to Functionalism,” McCullough gave a vividdescription of Reich at his best—Reich the careful teacher who was still very much in evi-dence during the last hectic years37.Reich and McCullough’s joint research concerned (inaddition to cloud-busting) certain chemical developments connected with the blackeningrocks and the DOR atmosphere. Reich believed that he had identified a number of newMyron SharafFury On Earth378éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Helen Tropp died of cancer in 1959 at the age of forty-two. Simeon maintained his commitment to Reich andorgonomy, practicing as a psychiatric orgone therapist with many devoted patients. He also became interested inmacrobiotics and exploring lysergic acid (LSD) treatment, pursuits to which he brought the same scattered inten-sity he gave to orgonomy. In 1968 he died in his mid-seventies of a heart attack."},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"chemical substances in the rocks.My concern here is less with the findings than with the method used. We can seeclearly the continuity in Reich from earlier years. For example, when McCullough beganworking with him, Reich did not assign him a specific research project. Rather, he gave hima broad mandate to work on any interesting problem within the general field of chemicaland biological phenomena associated with the Oranur experiment.Reich would occasionally make suggestions: “What would happen if you just putsome earth on a porous plate, added water, and then observed what occurred in this atmos-phere?” This kind of approach, so characteristic of his research method, reminds one ofReich’s “brew” of vegetables as an initial playful step on the road to the bions.At the same time that Reich taught an openness in experimental approaches, he alsocautioned strongly against random experimentation, especially actions that did not respectthe phenomena. McCullough described well his skepticism about the Oranur effects, whichagain and again led him to overexpose himself in the laboratory atmosphere in spite ofReich’s cautions to the contrary. (By 1953, the Students’ Laboratory was in use for researchagain but only for short periods of time.) These overexposures were followed by distressreactions such as swelling of the cervical glands and severe anxiety. Bob commented abouthis own behavior perceptively, stating that part of him did not believe orgone energy exist-ed and that he would take all kinds of steps to prove that it did. Such a course was futilesince the doubting part of him would not accept any proof; he would have done better tobring out his doubts openly and look at them frankly.On one occasion, McCullough ashed several decigrams of one of the chemical sub-stances he and Reich were studying, just “to see what the ash looked like!Before the furnace hadeven reached full operating temperature, I was forced to turn it off due to a severe organis-mic reaction.”38Reich went to McCullough’s home soon after the ashing, to determine whyMcCullough had done it. His assistant said he did it just to see what would happen. Reichreplied that you don’t kill living things that way, and you don’t fool around with high tem-peratures in an Oranur atmosphere.Whatever Reich’s annoyance with McCullough for such impulsive actions, he rarelyexpressed the kind ofanger he could to most of the people around. Ilse or I would perceiveOranur as an enormous jump beyond what we knew and were relatively comfortable with.However, McCullough, whatever his doubts about orgone energy or Oranur (and we all hadour doubts), entered the work with some knowledge of Oranur and enthusiasm for it. Hisattitude was different from the start, and Reich responded accordingly.McCullough also gave me a picture of Reich’s daily interactions during this lonelyperiod. Reich would usually come down to the Students’ Lab around 10:00 A.M., for he con-tinued his habit of writing during the first few hours of the day. He would ask McCulloughwhat was new. “I felt badly that only occasionally would be there something up, somethingnew.”Reich also wanted word of world news, which McCullough listened to each morningon the radio. Reich was especially concerned about hurricanes, earthquakes, atomic tests, and27 : Personal Life and Other Developments: 1950-1954379éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"the like.Reich used to enjoy a kind of Socratic argument with McCullough, as indeed withothers. Reich once asked him if he thought that Red China should be admitted to the UnitedNations, a hotly debated topic in the 1950s. McCullough said no. Reich, who was adamant-ly opposed to the admission of Red China, took another tack for the moment: “Well, thegovernment represents 700 million people.”This, then, was one Reich—a kind and helpful teacher, a thoughtful man turningideas around in his head, a lonely man. The New York physicians had given him a completeset of Beethoven’s recordings for his fifty-fifth birthday in 1952, knowing that Reich listenedto music a good deal in those years. He continued painting.The other Reich was also in evidence—quick to reach conclusions on slim evidence,prone to wishful thinking. McCullough saw this side, too. Sometime in 1953 or 1954,McCullough was invited to become a member of the New York Academy of Sciences.McCullough attributed this invitation to a recruitment drive, of no particular significance.Reich, for whom in times of stress little happened by chance either to himself or to those asso-ciated with him, thought it might be connected with the Academy’s interest in orgonomy.Reich needed to grab desperately at such straws for he was aware that the FDAinvestigation,still continuing, posed a dangerous threat to his very existence.Myron SharafFury On Earth380éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 None of Reich’s work after the Oranur experiment, nor his personal life, can beunderstood without considering the impact of the FDA investigation as it reemerged around1951, culminating in the injunction brought against him in February 1954. In August 1951,Reich had learned that the FDA was visiting accumulator users again. But when nothing fur-ther was heard about the FDA for the remainder of the year, he once more hoped that theinvestigation had ceased.It had not. On July 29, 1952, three men—one regular FDA inspector, one FDAmedical director, and one FDA physicist—came unannounced to the Observatory atOrgonon to “inspect the premises.” In order to drive to the Observatory, which was at thetop ofthe hill,one had to take down two chains barring vehicular access. The FDA repre-sentatives moved the chains and appeared at the Observatory entrance without any priornotification.In writing and speaking about this encounter, Reich was to refer to it constantly asa prime example of the contemptuous actions against him. He hated to be interrupted bytelephone or unannounced visits; he liked written appointments and screened telephonecalls. Those working for him had to make very sure that they were confronted with an emer-gency before they put through a call to him when he was writing or working in theObservatory. During the Oranur period and the accelerated FDA pressure, his rage overinterruptions and violations of his space and time increased greatly. One reason for this wasthat often there was no one on the property except him. Nathan C. Hale, a sculptor, writer,and supporter ofReich’s, remembers calling once to see if there were any orgone therapistsin California. He expected a secretary to answer but got Reich, who proceeded to shout athim in a way that left Hale shaking1.Trespassers on the property were frequent. People would just drive on up to see the“orgies”or whatever. Reich was apoplectic about such curiosity and sometimes innocentpersons were caught in his rage. Once, some Rangeley citizens were looking over a proper-ty for sale adjacent to Orgonon. In the belief that they were on his property, Reich camerunning out with gun in hand to chase them away. Reports of such incidents, probably madeeven more eccentric and dangerous in the retelling, did not help his image in Rangeley.On the afternoon of July 29, Ilse met the FDA representatives on the first floor ofthe Observatory, saying that Reich did not see people without an appointment. They per-suaded her to let Reich know that two of the men had made a special trip from Washingtonto see him. Hearing this, Reich changed his mind and came down, probably motivated more381éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"by his wrath than any desire to accommodate unwelcome visitors. The FDA men laterreportedhis bellowing: “What right do you people have to come here and ask me whethermy secretary has a lover? What do you think we are up here, bums?”2To my knowledge, this was the only time Reich met face to face with an FDA physi-cian and physicist. However, little of substance seems to have been said at this tense meet-ing. Reich made it a precondition of any interaction that they first read his writings. Finallyhe told the men to leave.Reich’s point about the accumulator not being a “device” represented a shift in histhinking. A year earlier he had acknowledged the FDA’s right, if it acted in good faith, to“investigate all devices at the manufacturing plant” to make sure they were correctly labeled.A week after the visit of the FDA men, Reich wrote: “I am contemplating to sug-gest that orgone accumulators be built within the respective states and not be shipped ininterstate commerce.”3Reich’s idea not to ship accumulators in interstate commerce wouldhave helped to protect him legally, but it would have meant acknowledging some validity tothe FDA’s position. He never pursued it.The recurrence of the FDA investigation, added to Reich’s other strains, led him toreturn slander with slander. When the FDA accused him of fraud, of racketeering, Reichbegan to call the FDA agents Higs (an acronym for “Hoodlums in government”). He alsocalled them Modjus, a term he had begun using in The Murder of Christto describe especial-ly virulent emotional plague characters *. Even worse, he accused FDA agents of being theconscious or unconscious tools of Red Fascists.Ironically, Reich made his wild accusations at the very time Senator JosephMcCarthy was riding high on similar accusations. McCarthy and his mentality of course con-tributed to the atmosphere of fear and suspicion that made the attack on Reich possible inthe America of the early 1950s, and McCarthy used the very tactics Reich was analyzing ascharacteristic of the emotional plague. McCarthy relied on the ordinary citizen’s fear ofbeing attacked to ensure that no one would stand up against him in his wild assaults. At notime did Reich support McCarthy; but at times he engaged in McCarthyism.It is a great tragedy that with all the facts in hand, Reich began to emphasize theleast factual part ofhis entire case, and that he stooped to such name-calling. In Reich’semphasis on the “Red Fascists” as instigators of the campaign against his work, we see onceagain a desperate effort on his part to make contact with a hostile world. At times heMyron SharafFury On Earth382éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Reich devised the term by combining the first letters of the name Mocenigo, the man who betrayed GiordanoBruno to the Inquisition, and the first letters of Stalin’s original name,Djugashvili. Reich always had a penchant foracronyms, but his coinage of them grew in the last desperate years. In part, their usage reflected his desire to over-whelm his opponents with a verbal barrage and to rally his supporters to blind allegiance. George Orwell has per-ceptively commented on the use of similar abbreviations in the “Newspeak” of1984:“In abbreviating a word onenarrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it....Cominternis a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas Communist Internationalis a phraseover which one is obliged to linger at least temporarily” George Orwell, 1984 (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1949),310."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"believed that “the enemies of my enemies are my friends.” However, at no time did Reichparticipate in what was quite common in the early 1950s—informing on persons he hadknown as Communists during the 1920s and 1930s. When an FBI agent visited Orgononand asked Reich for such names, he refused to give them, although he was quite willing totalk about his own past and present political positions4.No one was able to challenge Reich successfully on the Red Fascist question. Wolfe,who would have been best suited to do so, was no longer close to him. In my view, few ofhis associates entirely shared his conviction, though a larger number tried to convince them-selves that Reich was right. Some, including myself, argued with him about it but with littlesuccess. Reich was at his most authoritarian on this particular matter, just as decades earlierhe had insisted that a true psychoanalyst had to be in the camp of the political left. In the19508, Reich would allude to his earlier political experiences with the Communists, whichnone of us shared—he knew what they were like firsthand, we didn’t. There could be noreal discussion in such an atmosphere.Reich’s faith in the American government remained strong despite the FDA actionand was reinforced by the election of General Dwight Eisenhower as President inNovember 1952. Like millions of other Americans, Reich found Eisenhower’s warm, engag-ing personality very attractive. But his hope of help from somewhere led him into a highlyidealized view of what Eisenhower was like. On the night of Eisenhower’s election, Reichtaped a conversation he had at Orgonon with Drs. Baker, Raphael, Tropp, and IlseOllendorff. He was thrilled by the landslide vote given Eisenhower: “Eisenhower has thesimplicity, the closeness and contactfulness of genital characters. I do not know him, really,personally; but that is what I feel about him, also his wife. Now that is a sexual revolution.”5Reich began to develop the fantasy that Eisenhower was a secret friend, along withother friends in high places. These allies would help him against the Food and DrugAdministration, the pharmaceutical industry, the American Medical Association, theAmerican Psychiatric and Psychoanalytic associations, and his political enemies. However,,there is not a scintilla ofevidence that his notion of powerful friends had any reality. Thedelusion that such friends existed would cost him dearly in the years to come.Reich’s assumption ofpowerful governmental friends led him to believe, sometimearound 1953, that U.S. Air Force planes were making occasional flights over Orgonon to seewhat he was doing and to protect him. Ilse could not understand this at all and it exacerbat-ed the tension between them.Then, in November 1953, Reich read a book on flying saucers by Donald Keyhoe6.He was primed to respond, for he had long believed that life had developed in the universeand was not confined to our planet7.Not long after reading the report, Reich did more thantake flying saucers as fact. He began to use them, sometimes definitely, sometimes tentative-ly,as a major cause of the DOR emergency. He became convinced that the UFOs were“space ships” powered by orgone energy. He based this interpretation on certain observa-tions that had been made of flying saucers: the bluish light shimmering through the open-ings ofthe machines,their comparatively silent motion, and the unusual maneuvers they28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 383éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"were capable of making. And he devised an acronym to refer to the drivers of thesemachines: CORE (Cosmic Orgone Engineering) men.In April 1952, the time when the most frequent sightings of flying saucers weremade, Reich found a reason for the increase in DOR effects. If the saucers used orgoneenergy, they would give off waste material or exhaust; such “slag” might be DOR. The DORcould be coming into the earth’s atmosphere accidentally or as a deliberate action on the partof the navigators. Alternately, the deliberate path of DOR might have malignant or benignintentions behind it. If malignant, we were at war with invaders participating in the creationof deserts. If benign, the navigators might be giving us a cosmic lesson concerning the“immunization” benefits of DOR sickness8.One should bear in mind the growing belief among serious students of UFOs thatsome sightings have never been satisfactorily explained and that the government has notbeen frank about the matter9. Still, Reich seriously erred in building so elaborate a super-structure on the basis of such scant evidence, exactly the kind of relationship between the-ory and fact he normally deplored. In my view, Reich speculated far beyond the verifiablefacts for the same reason that he idealized Eisenhower: he was desperately looking for sup-port. CORE men who used orgone-fueled ships could be powerful allies who thought asReich did. (Indeed, in 1954 Reich changed the name of his periodical,Orgone Energy Bulletin,to CORE, denoting his cloud-busting concern with cosmic orgone engineering.) However,it might take more time than the crisis with the FDA permitted for friendly space travelersto make contact with him. If, on the other hand, these visitors were deliberately poisoningearth’s atmosphere, the world would soon need Reich’s concepts and techniques in order towage effective cosmic war. Reich’s imagery concerning the CORE men—their orgonomiccreativity and destructivity—represents a vivid externalization of the high-pitched fermentwithin himself at this time.Although Reich held some very irrational ideas during this period, most of the timehe was functioning on quite a different level.Writing Neill in 1954, he responded to Neill’squery as to whether orgonomy would penetrate socially before mechanistic scientists blewup the world. Reich said he did not know but he did believe that our mechanistic-mysticalcivilization had already died.He remained outside this world and took pride in his separate-ness from it10.He repeatedly and rightly criticized Neill for looking to various authorities to“accept” orgonomy. As Reich pointed out, it was an honor not to be accepted by a destruc-tive status quo. All the sadder, then, was his own seeking of acceptance from the Americangovernment.One can understand Reich’s desperate hope for some kind of support when onerealizes the ferocity and the range of the attacks against him. Hardly a month went by whenthere was not some new incident.Thus, in the winter of 1953, Bernard Grad was detainedat the Canadian border on his journey from Montreal to visit Orgonon and was interrogat-ed about his association with Reich. In February, several medical orgonomists were asked toappear before professional boards to defend their adherence to orgonomy11.Myron SharafFury On Earth384éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"Today, when there is widespread public as well as professional interest in Reich’spsychiatric treatment but not the accumulator, many people believe that the attacks in the1950s completely centered on the “box.” This was not the case. Reich’s entire later work wasunder a cloud of obloquy. To give one example: in the spring of 1953, Dr. D. EwenCameron, then president of the American Psychiatric Association, told a patient who wasconsidering psychiatricorgone therapy that such therapy was “pure fake and that theAmerican Psychiatric Association was going to bring charges of fraud against Dr. Reich.”12Reich always wished to be informed about such incidents, much as they hurt andenraged him. Yet the most serious threat to orgonomy came not from visible manifestations,but from actions Reich was unaware of: the accumulator tests the FDA was conducting dur-ing 1952 and 1953. Since the FDA had not been able to find any dissatisfied users, medicaltests conducted under its auspices were to be crucial for evidence.The FDA never took its task lightly, even though some of the tests were grosslyinadequate. It did not have the resources to run its own tests on the validity of the accumu-lator. Tests were therefore carried out by a variety of hospitals and clinics, including suchprestigious institutions as the Mayo and Lahey clinics. Here we will concentrate on the heartof the FDA’s evidence—the biomedical tests. (The FDA’s replications of the temperaturedifference and the electroscopic measure—its physical tests—were described in Chapter 21.) Reich was quite correct in fearing that he would be at a serious disadvantage in anycourtroom procedure where scientists with all the right credentials presented inadequatelyconducted control studies of his findings. Carried out by reputable people, the FDA’s testswere just good enough not to be transparently unscientific, but still palpably inadequate asany genuine assessment. Most of the outside replicators of orgonomy were as convinced ofits falsity as the FDA was even before embarking on the testing.Dr. Frank H. Krusen of the Mayo Clinic wrote on August 24, 1953, to the FDA:“It was very difficult for me to bring myself to take the time to prepare this report becauseof the fact that this quackery is of such a fantastic nature that it hardly seems worthwhile torefute the ridiculous claims ofits proponents.”13Other investigators also indicated theircontempt priorto any investigation.Most ofthe FDA tests bore out Reich’s long-standing criticism of controlled repli-cations of orgonomic findings: they violated essential conditions of the original experi-ments. For this reason, Reich had urged that he or another medical orgonomist participate in the FDA tests. The FDA never acceded to thiscondition, insisting on the necessity for entirely independent verification. They too had apoint;still,for a completely fair assessment, their researchers would have to follow meticu-lously all conditions of the original experiments. Not only did they not meet these condi-tions, they often failed to mention their existence.One striking way the tests failed is that they generally consisted of having patientssit in the accumulator only a few times. At Johns Hopkins Hospital, for example, a sixty-four-year-old woman with cancer of the large intestine and of the pelvis was treated fourtimes with the accumulator for twenty minutes each on June 9, 10, 11, and 12, 1952. She died28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 385éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":387,"pageContent":"on June 12. This was no test at all, since Reich never claimed that accumulator usage for soshort a time in such a severe illness would have an effect.* Nor was this an exception. AtJohns Hopkins the average duration of accumulator treatment for nineteen women withmalignant tumors was four or five days, with several being treated for only two or threedays14.None of the tests showed a proper regard for Reich’s emphasis on the fact that var-ious forms of radiation from X-rays to radium dial watches negatively influenced orgoneenergy. Such forms of radiation were likely to be abundantly present in the medical settingswhere the FDA conducted their tests.Here as elsewhere there was room for discussions between Reich and the experi-menters making control studies. But such discussions never took place; and there is no evi-dence that the medical testers were at all familiar with Reich’s writings. They lacked anyawareness of the clinical signs one might find from even brief accumulator usage. That theFDA cancer patients died says nothing at all about the validity of Reich’s findings. Most ofhis own patients died.Even the best FDA tests done for the FDA failed badly on the above criteria.George B. Smith, M.D., of the Holy Ghost Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, treated quitesick cancer patients with the accumulator blanket. Some cases were treated daily for twomonths. Smith includes in his report one rather mysterious sentence that the patient wastreated from “10 to 30 minutes depending on the patient’s tolerance.”15Why a patientshould become “intolerant” of a blanket was never explained. Nor does Smith indicate whatsymptoms the patient manifested to indicate that his or her degree of tolerance had beenpassed. Yet it is precisely in such reports that one can find some of the subjective evidencefor orgone effects, for example, the patient’s reporting sensations of heat, prickling, or itch-ing.Some positive effects, in terms of Reich’s criteria, were noted when illnesses of lessseverity than cancer were treated. William F. Taylor, M.D., of Maine General Hospital,admitted a patient to the accident ward with burns on her face, ears, nose, neck, dorsum offingers and hands, and volar surface of the wrists, following a stove explosion. The six-inchfunnel from the accumulator was placed about four or five inches from the right side of herneck for twenty minutes. Within five minutes of beginning treatment, the patient said thather neck felt better and that it was less painful than her face and hands. The next day therewas no evidence ofblistering of the neck, but still some blistering in other burned areas.The neck continued to heal nicely, while the other burned areas had further crusting andblistering.16This case has particular significance because the accumulator treatment of burnsand wounds was one of the few instances where Reich maintained that rapid and strikingMyron SharafFury On Earth386éditionsles atomes de l’âme*It is true, as noted in Chapter 22, that Reich reported one case where a tumor was no longer palpable after eighttreatment sessions. However, his cancer cases generally required a much longer course of treatment and even inthis instance the schedule was twice as long as most of the Johns Hopkins treatments."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"results could be obtained. Not surprisingly, the FDA was in doubt whether this particularphysician should be called as an expert witness because portions of his testimony would befavorable to the accumulator.Two cancer studies using mice were conducted by the Jackson Laboratory in BarHarbor, Maine. The results showed no significant differences between the control groupsand the groups treated with the orgone accumulator in rate of death, final age at death,weight gain, or malignancy of the autopsied tissue17.The medical orgonomist Richard Blasband commented on this particular study:This test is so different from Reich’s mouse experiments that it cannot beconsidered a valid test of his claims. The Jackson Laboratory used transplantedtumor cells instead of letting the tumors develop spontaneously. Spontaneoustumors grow more slowly and permit a natural development of defensive reac-tions... .Of greatest importance is the fact that the treatment rooms at the JacksonLaboratory were located only 100 feet away from two X-ray machines which wereused at least several times a week... . When the investigator in charge of the exper-iment was informed of this fact, he admitted not having read any of the literaturewhere the Oranur problem was discussed. He said he wished to remain “complete-ly objective.”18The FDA carried out a careful replication of the Reich Blood Test. As we haveseen, Reich had found that the rate and form of disintegration of red blood cells into bio-nous vesicles was one indication of the orgonotic vitality of an organism. The FDA testconsisted of examining the rate of disintegration of red blood cells from two groups ofsubjects, those believed to be healthy (all employees of the Nassau Hospital in Mineola, NewYork) and those with a known diagnosis ofmalignance ofvarious organs. There were fif-teen subjects in each control group19.The FDA made no statistical analysis ofthe differences found. The researchersattributed their differences to extraneous factors such as problems in covering the prepara-tion between observations and the inconstancy of red blood cell disintegration from day today.In his subsequent analysis ofFDA data, Richard Blasband in fact found the results animpressive confirmation of Reich’s findings: two and a half times as many cancer patientsas “normals”showed a 50 percent blood cell disintegration within five minutes20.Whether we are dealing with positive or negative replications, the FDA tests openedthe way to all kinds of exchanges of views that might have led to further fruitful experimen-tation. But they were not conducted with this aim in mind. By and large, the FDA’s investi-gators eagerly set about proving the FDA right and were uninterested in any findings thatmight shake their preconceived judgment. However, these researchers and investigators, usu-ally ineptly and riddled with bias but on occasion more objectively, were attempting to reachthe core ofthe issue—the efficacy of the accumulator. It is by such tests, properly conduct-28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 387éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"ed, that Reich’s work stands or falls, and he always said as much. It was never, basically, aquestion of a medical license, whether he carried a gun, or whether the Red Fascists wereafter him. At issue essentially was whether the accumulator could help heal burns or wounds,and whether or not sick blood disintegrated faster than healthy blood.A further irony is that for the wrong reasons and usually in the wrong way theinvestigators (Reich’s enemies) were doing what only a few of his friends did: they were mak-ing clinical runs, they were measuring the temperature differences, and the like. Reich want-ed people to make the tests, not admire or hate him. He might well, like Montessori, havelikened his disciples to dogs who look at their trainer rather than at what he is pointing to.His friends were enchanted with him. His enemies hated him and the very idea of what hewas talking about. Hardly anyone looked seriously at his work.Finally, the FDA came up with some very mixed and suggestive findings. At leastsome of the FDA tests showed some suggestive positive result not cure-alls, but indices thatperhaps something important was at hand here.David Blasband, a lawyer sympathetic to orgonomy, assessed the approaching legalconfrontation, although he was not aware at the time of the FDA test results:IfReich had entered a defense ...I am convinced that the underlying issuewould have been the existence and function of orgone energy. The governmentwould have introduced the results of its tests to show the accumulator has no ther-apeutic effect on mice. Undoubtedly, classical scientists would also have been calledby the government as expert witnesses. Reich could then have introduced his owntest results as well as evidence of therapeutic experiences. In view of the conflict-ing testimony, the trier of facts would have been required to determine if a box-shaped structure built only of simple organic and inorganic materials could do whatReich said it could. ... I think it most unlikely that a judge or jury would have foundfor Reich. The concept of orgone energy was too new and too simple21.The blow fell on February 10, 1954, when at the FDA’s request the U.S. Attorneyfor the state of Maine filed a complaint for injunction against Wilhelm Reich, IlseOllendorff,and the Wilhelm Reich Foundation. On the same day, the federal AttorneyGeneral’s Office also announced the complaint action for an injunction against interstateshipment ofaccumulators. It mentioned extensive investigations that proved the nonexis-tence of orgone energy, and concluded with the charge that the accumulators were “mis-branded under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because of false and misleading claims.”The complaint was a twenty-seven-page document containing information aboutthe accumulator and insinuating that Reich was a profiteer on human misery22. Orgoneenergy was declared nonexistent; the accumulator was declared worthless. All Reich’sAmerican publications were regarded as promotional material for the accumulator. This wasmaintained even for works originally published in German prior to the discovery of orgoneenergy such as Character Analysis, The Sexual Revolution, and The Mass Psychology ofMyron SharafFury On Earth388éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Fascism, since Reich, either in a foreword or in added material, mentioned orgone energy inthe English editions of these works.The complaint argued that although Reich made a disclaimer of a cure from the useof the accumulator, he published case reports where great benefits were reported. However,in many instances the complaint distorted what Reich or others had written. For example, itquoted one of Reich’s case histories which stated that a brain tumor was destroyed “as earlyas two weeks after the beginning of treatment.” It omitted the conclusion to the case givenin the same paragraph: “But the detritus from the tumor filled and clogged the lymph glandsand the patient died.”23The complaint concluded with a “prayer for relief,” asking that the defendants and“all persons in active concert or participation with any of them, be perpetually enjoined”from shipping accumulators in interstate commerce.The FDA was entirely within its mandate in this first plea. It was up to Reich in hisdefense to demonstrate that the FDA’s investigation was biased and its tests unscientific. Itrested upon him to bring forth his own positive evidence for the accumulator. However, theplaintiff further “prayed” that the defendants and “all persons in active concert or in partic-ipation with any of them, be perpetually enjoined from directly or indirectly doing or caus-ing to be done any act,whether oral, written or otherwise in the manner aforesaid or in anyother manner, with respect to any orgone energy accumulator device.” In this request theFDA demonstrated that it was out to stop not just the accumulator but orgonomic research.For, as Reich later correctly reasoned, almost anything he wrote or said about orgone ener-gy could be construed as being connected, directly or indirectly, with the accumulator. Herethe FDA was directly attacking freedom of speech and freedom of the press.It should be emphasized that the complaint did not in fact seek the destruction oremendation of any of Reich’s publications. This goal was revealed, as we shall see, in theinjunction decree itself; it was merely inferred by the second part of the complaint’s“prayer.”The complaint was signed by Peter Mills,U.S. Attorney for the state of Maine. Herewe discern another ofthe squalid subplots that flicker through Reich’s story. For severalyears, in the late 1940s and early 19508, Peter Mills had acted as the lawyer for the WilhelmReich Foundation. He had even discussed the FDA investigation with Reich. Conceivably,Reich could have made a considerable legal issue of his former lawyer’s becoming his pros-ecutor.But he never chose to do so.Reich was stunned to receive the complaint from a federal marshal, WilliamDoherty. For three days he could not act. When he recovered from this state of shock, hisfirst response was to consider complying in the eventuality that the Portland court mightenjoin the accumulator alone or all of his activities. Initially, Reich was also favorable to theidea of the New York orgonomists, taking over responsibility for the defense of the accu-mulator in court. According to Baker, “he felt that his responsibility was that of a scientist,making discoveries but not having to defend them in court. However, if the physicianswished to take any action they could.” Baker and other orgonomic physicians based in New28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 389éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"York obtained an attorney and prepared to enter the case as “friends of the court.” Then,says Baker, Reich changed his mind: “I received another call from Reich stating that he haddecided to assume charge of the defense himself, and that the accumulators were, after all,his responsibility. He requested that we drop our action, which we did.”24Before the injunction hearing, which was scheduled for March 19, Reich soughtlegal advice from a Maine lawyer. The lawyer said that if he were to represent Reich in court,he would try to have the complaint reduced so that the injunction applied only to the accu-mulator and not, as it did by implication, to orgonomic literature as well. Reich made it clearimmediately that he had no intention of “bargaining” the accumulator for the literature. Todo so would be to acknowledge that the FDA was right, even partially.Thus very early in the actual legal process we see attitudes highly characteristic ofReich. One reaction was to withdraw from the whole matter. In 1935, when Annie was mak-ing it difficult for Reich to see his children, he responded with a similar desire to withdraw.Another tendency was to hit wildly at people closest to him. This, too, he showed after thecomplaint, especially vis-à-vis Ilse, who was still working with him and trying to maintaintheir relationship. His resolve not to bargain with the FDA or to try to win on technicalitieswas also evident early on. This position was to make his relations with lawyers, for whombargaining and technicalities comprised the name of the game, extremely difficult.Another decision—and a fateful one—was how precisely to meet the complaint,and, in particular, whether to appear in court to oppose the injunction directly. Initially,Reich was leaning toward a court appearance. Here he would have a chance to show thefaults in the logic, the methods, the biases of the FDA. Here was his chance to bring forthhis own evidence and the evidence of co-workers who had confirmed his findings. Sinceboth the traditionalists, who labeled his device a “fraud,” and the innovators could be blind-ed by self-interest, where else but in a courtroom could a sound judgment be reached? Whoelse could decide when the new is the future, when it is truly revolutionary science that over-turns old paradigms, and when it is a fraud or a delusion? These were some ofthe advantages to Reich’s appearing in court. Yet from hisviewpoint there was one principal reason for not appearing. It involved granting the right ofa judge or jury to decide matters of scientific fact. This prospect made Reich exceedinglyuncomfortable. However, he was prepared to consider it quiteseriously when another factorarose.Sometime between February 10 and February 24, a meeting took place attended by,among others, Reich, Baker, Chester Raphael, and Michael Silvert. I must here “declare aninterest” and comment that I never liked Silvert’s fanatical, humorless temperament; heechoed and amplified Reich’s belligerent dogmatism but with few of Reich’s redeemingvirtues. Still, his role in Reich’s last years was an important one and I shall try to describehim objectively. Formerly a staff physician at the Menninger Clinic, Silvert had, according toGreenfield, the reputation there of being a talented if somewhat erratic psychiatrist. In hislate thirties he left the clinic to undergo training with Reich, but for six years or until around1954 Reich kept him out of his inner circle. Reich recognized Silvert’s destructive character-Myron SharafFury On Earth390éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"istics. For example, Silvert commuted frequently between New York and Rangeley, not onlybecause he was still in treatment with Reich but because he wanted to be as close to Reichas possible. He would carry tales of “bad” doings by other orgonomic workers, deeds oftendistorted or exaggerated in Silvert’s retelling. At the same time, Reich was attracted toSilvert’s energy, technical intelligence, and dedication. Unlike most orgonomic physicians,Silvert was as interested in Reich’s scientific work as he was in his therapy. Also, unlike mostof the physicians, who were family men, Silvert lived alone, devoting most of his spare timeto orgonomy, and to helping Reich wherever and whenever the latter would permit him todo so. (In turn, some of Silvert’s patients, particularly males, were devoted to him and speakwell of him to this day.) Where Reich’s medical associates were threatened by the possibili-ty of an injunction, Silvert seemed to court such dangers, almost as a kind of exaggerationof Reich’s intransigence.Lois Wyvell, who knew both men well, believes—and I concur—that Reich was fas-cinated by the challenge of understanding and treating Silvert’s destructiveness precisely ata time when the problem of the emotional plague concerned Reich more than any other. Ifhe could help Silvert, Silvert could be a valuable colleague in fighting the plague—Reichalways liked (in his image) to put a reformed fox in charge of the chicken coop. If not, Reichhoped he could channel Silvert’s gifts and recklessness toward ends of Reich’s choosing.However, as we shall see, Silvert’s hostile “orgonomic” fanaticism may well have enhancedReich’s irrationality.Returning to the February meeting, Reich participated in the discussion of alterna-tive ways of dealing with the complaint, and began to lean toward appearing in court. AsBaker was later to write,the discussion was going smoothly until Dr. Silvert, who was ... opposedto Reich’s appearance in court, asked defiantly: “And what happens to the truth inall this?”The lawyer replied: “It comes out of the embarrassment each side inflictson the other.” Reich became very angry, stopped the discussion, paced the floorand accused those present oftrying to entangle him in court action.His appear-ance in court was no longer considered25.The operative word in this exchange was “embarrassment.” Clearly Reich, a proudman,would not like to have mud thrown in his face. And at a trial there would be plenty ofit. “Have you a license to practice medicine? Yes or no, Doctor.” Like Freud before him,Reich liked to give, but he deeply resented being “ordered” or “expected” to give. The factthat after doing all that he had done, giving unstintingly of his gifts to science, he shouldnow be called into court and required to face “the embarrassment each side inflicts on theother” was, in his view, unmitigated indecency.Infuriated, Reich swung hard to the other side: he would not go to court. He thendecided on an unusual course ofaction,and one that was to prove very costly. Instead ofappearing in court, Reich opted for a written document entitled “Response.” This Response28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 391éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"was sent on February 25, 1954, along with a short cover letter, to Judge John D. Clifford, Jr.,of the U.S. District Court for the district of Maine, where the complaint had been issued.Reich also sent the court copies of his publications.The essential position of the Response was that basic natural-scientific researchcould not be decided in a courtroom. However, Reich was aware of the complications ofthis position, for his Response stated: “There are conspirators around whose aim is todestroy human happiness and self-government. Is ... the right of the conspirator to ravagehumanity the same as my right to free, unimpeded inquiry? It obviously is not the samething.”26Reich could not resolve the question: Who decides what is basic natural researchand what is destructive? His attempt at a solution was unconvincing. To quote in part fromhis Response:It is not permissible, either morally, legally, or factually to force a naturalscientist to expose his scientific results and methods of basic research in court... .To appear in court as a defendantin matters of basic natural research wouldin itself appear, to say the least, extraordinary. It would require disclosure of evi-dence in support ofthe position ofthe discovery of the Life Energy. Such disclo-sure, however, would involve untold complications and possibly national disaster27.Reich’s threats about disclosure leading to a “national disaster” were irrelevant andhistrionic. He could present a substantial defense against the FDA’s complaint on the basisof his findings and witnesses and through cross-examination of the government’s experts.Nowhere in his Response did Reich deal with the specific FDA complaint, namely, that hemade claims regarding the accumulator that were not true. He simply said that the plaintiff“by his mere Complaint already has shown his ignorance in matters of natural science.”Since the FDA was saying the same thing about him,who was to decide? Somehow Reich believed, or at least he hoped, that the judge would be able to tellfrom his Response and from his literature that Reich was a bona fide scientist, not a quack.Such an unrealistic hope,and such a misunderstanding of the American legal system revealReich at his most childishly naive and self-deluding. Had he sent his Response simply as amatter of record, one could respect his principled position even if one sharply disagreedwith it.But the combination in Reich of principle plus hope for the principle being under-stood was as self-deceiving as it was self-destructive.A third alternative was for Reich to have appeared in court but limited his defenseto the constitutional issues. At least he would have had a far greater standing in court thanhe gained through the written Response. Reich may have thought that his Response wasequivalent to this position. It was not taken that way by the court. The judge did give somedeliberation to the Response, but then, according to an FDA memo dated March 9, “itappears that the decision has been reached to characterize this document as a ‘crank letter.’It will not be construed as an appearance on the part of any one or all the defendants, sinceMyron SharafFury On Earth392éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"... there is a waiver to that effect in the document.” The waiver referred to is Reich’s state-ment that “I therefore submit, in the name of truth and justice, that I shall not appear inCourt as the defendant... .”Judge Clifford, who later proved to be a kindly man in his dealings with Reich, maywell have considered informing Reich that his Response had no legal standing prior to thescheduled hearing on the injunction. However, just as Reich was operating in a very ambigu-ous situation with regard to his own fate, so the judge must have been at a loss to compre-hend Reich’s Response. Very likely, the FDA representatives painted a picture of Reich as adangerous manipulator or fanatic who was defying the court. Obviously, their task would bemuch easier without opposition in the courtroom.And so it was. When Reich failed to appear, the FDA had a feast of a victory. Theresulting injunction itself went further than the complaint in that it specifically included theliterature as well as the accumulator28. All accumulators leased to patients were to berecalled and destroyed. The FDA seemed to regard the accumulator as simultaneouslyworthless (accumulating nothing) and dangerous (to be destroyed). The injunction orderedthat all in-stock copies of Reich’s soft-cover publications, including the International Journalfor Sex-Economy and Orgone-Research, the Orgone Energy Bulletin, and The Oranur Experimentshould be destroyed. All of Reich’s hard-cover books, many of which included only periph-eral references to orgone energy, were ordered withheld from further distribution. Theycould be sold only if Reich deleted “statements and representations pertaining to the exis-tence of orgone energy ... and allied material.” This of course was impossible. As Reich onceasked, how would one define “allied material”? Were references to “libido,” “bio-electricity,”or “streamings” allied material, since in Reich’s system all three terms referred to orgoneenergy? It is clear that the destruction and withholding of Reich’s publications were actionsindependent of the accumulator. Even after the accumulators were demolished, some liter-ature still had to be destroyed and the rest censored. The rationale for this legalized destruc-tive rage was that the accumulator, though harmless itself, was dangerous because its advo-cacy could prevent sick people from obtaining effective help. Similarly, Reich’s soft-coverpublications were treated entirely as instructions for building worthless accumulators, or aspromotional material for a fraud. In order to avoid the accusation of book burning, theFDA was glaringly inconsistent. It ordered, for example, the destruction of journals that didnot contain as much information about the accumulator as did The Cancer Biopathy,a hard-cover book. The latter could still be distributed if Reich deleted references to orgone ener-gy and allied material, albeit an impossible task.The injunction decree also went slightly further than even the outrageous secondpart of the complaint’s prayer. I shall italicize the significant addition:It is ordered...That the defendants refrain from, either directly or indirectly, in violationof said Act, disseminating information pertaining to the assembly, construction, or28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 393éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"composition of orgone energy accumulator devices to be employed for therapeutic or pro-phylactic uses by man or for other animals[italics mine M.R.S.].Protecting other species as well as man from the accumulator, the FDA struck apioneering blow for animal liberation.In The Oranur ExperimentReich wrote that, using the language of emotions, orgoneenergy responds to nuclear radiation at first with paralysis and later with fury. When hereceived the complaint, Reich was paralyzed for three days. When he received the injunction,Reich responded with rage.The particular path of discharge for Reich’s rage was a rain-making operation. Thisplan seems to have been set in motion only hours after he received the injunction decree29.He fired off a telegram to Ivan Tannehill of the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C.,with a copy to Don Kent, weather reporter for WBZ in Boston, announcing his intention:According to the Federal Food and Drug Administration, Orgone Energydoes not exist. We are drawing east to west from Hancock, Maine, and Orgonon,Rangeley, Maine, to cause storm to prove that orgone energy does exist.Consequences of this action are all your responsibility and that of Federal JudgeClifford of Portland, Maine. We are flooding the East as you are drying out theSouthwest, You do not play with serious natural-scientific research30.Snow in Rangeley and rain along the New England coast came after Reich’s weath-er operations; it had not been predicted. As with all of Reich’s weather operations, it couldbe argued that the rain would have come without his intervention. The forecasts may sim-ply have been wrong, as they so often are. In any case, Reich believed he had caused the pre-cipitation.He sent offanother telegram declaring this conviction—with copies to thePresident,J.Edgar Hoover, and the United and Associated presses in Portland, Maine.Reich’s reactions are quite understandable: he wished to demonstrate his power andthe reality oforgone energy in as dramatic a way as he could. What is less comprehensibleis how he convinced himself that such efforts would have the slightest impact on the author-ities. No one knew better than he their capacity to explain away events of this kind.After Reich calmed down from his initial reaction, he went through a phase of plan-ning to comply with the injunction. On March 30, Ilse Ollendorff, as clerk of theFoundation and one ofthe defendants, sent a telegram to Mills, advising him that “theWilhelm Reich Foundation is far advanced in preparing full compliance with injunction.”For a period after the injunction, the Foundation did not send out further accumu-lators or literature. However, accumulators previously rented were not recalled. The renterswere informed of the decree and the decision to keep or return them was left to them. Forthe most part,the users decided to keep the accumulators.Reich could have instituted appeal procedures on limited grounds. There was a clearMyron SharafFury On Earth394éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"constitutional issue regarding the literature. But he would have none of this. In his eyes, anysuch appeal would have meant granting the constitutionality of the ban on the accumulator.Reich’s tight linkage of his literature and the accumulator was understandable butill-advised. It was understandable because Reich had always stressed the unity of thoughtand action. If birth control was desirable, for example, a true physician did not limit himselfto talking or writing about it; he did what Reich did in the 1920s and 1930s—he distributeddevices to those, unmarried or married, fourteen or forty, who sought them, whether suchdistribution was legal or not. Similarly, one not only wrote about or experimented withorgone energy; one made available a device that accumulated the energy’s healing propertiesto those who wished to use it. Paraphrasing Marx, Reich wanted not only to understand theworld but to change it. As he wrote in 1942 in an issue of a journal destroyed by the FDAand today a collector’s item:... We cannot find consolation in the expectation that our work will“somehow and some day” find general recognition. Our work is neither of theother world, like that of the church, nor of some distant future, as people wouldlike to see it; no, it has its roots in contemporary life, here, today, and in a practicalway.We do not intend to wait until, fifty or a hundred years from now, the existenceof the orgone may finally be conceded. It is up to us, and not to any so-called“authority,” to see that the existence of the biological energy is recognized31.At the same time, Reich’s all-or-nothing approach was misconceived. The device forwhich he claimed certain curative and preventive properties required a legal defense. He hadhad his opportunity for a “day in court” and he had not taken it. There was no way for thedefendants to reopen the injunction decree banning the accumulator. Nevertheless, freedomof speech and freedom of the press are constitutionally guaranteed save under the mostexceptional circumstances, such as disclosure of military secrets. Those aspects of theinjunction that called for the destruction or censorship oforgonomic literature were uncon-stitutional and could have been fought on that ground. But Reich chose not to see it thatway.Reich shifted his stance on one issue.Before that injunction he alone took respon-sibility for the handling of the case; now he adopted the position that the accumulators werethe responsibility ofthe physicians who prescribed them. This led to a new development.On May 15, 1954, fifteen orgonomic physicians moved to intervene in the govern-ment’s case against Reich. They argued that their right to practice medicine as they deemedwise was violated by the injunction since they could not prescribe the accumulator topatients. The government had mailed copies of the injunction to them, thereby bindingthem to its conditions.“The Court held that the orgonomists did not have the absolute right to intervenesince the injunction was in personamagainst Reich, the foundation, and Isle Ollendorff.”32An extraordinary inconsistency had now crept into the government’s position—28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 395éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"and into that of the court. Presumably, their intent was to protect the public from a “mis-branded” article, the accumulator. However, the new ruling made it legal for the orgono-mists to use the accumulator so long as they did not act “in concert” with Reich or theFoundation. Clearly, the government was less interested in stopping the accumulator than instopping Reich personally.The orgonomists’ case was appealed through higher courts, including the U.S.Supreme Court. It lost in every hearing. While the first appeal was being heard, JudgeClifford ruled that the part of the injunction ordering the destruction of publications andaccumulators be delayed until “final determination of the ... appeal ... or ... further orderfrom this Court.” Reich took heart from this ruling. He notified the court that he intendedto resume all activities. As Baker commented: “A lack of protest from the court he interpret-ed as consent and, with the passage of time, acquired a false sense of security, even believ-ing that the case had been won. When reminded that he was only temporarily protected bythe orgonomists’ action, he could not believe it.”33How did the world in general react? The response was an intellectual disgrace. First,there was very little publicity about the injunction itself—brief newspaper or magazine arti-cles stating that the decree had been passed. There was no outrage about the book-burningor book-banning provisions ofthe injunction. And from professional organizations camemore than neglect; they rendered the FDA effusive thanks. To give but a few examples:Dr. Daniel Blain, medical director of the American Psychiatric Association, wrotethe FDA: “We are delighted to hear of the successful prosecution of your action against theWilhelm Reich Foundation, and I know that I speak for the profession at large in express-ing our deep appreciation of the good work of the Food and Drug Administration.”34Dr. Richard L. Frank, secretary of the American Psychoanalytic Association,expressed his appreciation as follows:...The American Psychoanalytic Association wishes to commend theFood and Drug Administration for their effective action in this situation.Dr. Reich and his associates are not members of the AmericanPsychoanalytic Association and their theories and activities are completely foreignto all ofour theories and practices... . Unfortunately, we were never in a position toexercise any control over or to influence his activities in any way35.Mildred Brady, whose article had triggered the FDA investigation in the first place,waited until Reich’s trial before she wrote to the FDA: “There is a kind of journalistic excite-ment in learning that an article you wrote years ago has been instrumental in bearing suchfruit.”36Some institutions responded to the iajuction more in relief than in gladness.Charles L. Dunham of the Atomic Energy Commission wrote in part: “I appreciate verymuch your making this [news of the injunction decree] available to me, as you know onlytoo well what a thorn in the side he [Reich] has been to many of us.”37Myron SharafFury On Earth396éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"It is sad and ironic to hear Dunham dismiss Reich as some kind of crank. Reich haddiligently sent copies of his publications to the AEC. While he maintained orgone energydid not lie within the jurisdiction of the FDA, if it belonged under the jurisdiction of anyagency, it was the AEC. Little did he know that he was simply a “thorn in the side” to them.Reich should have known. Yet typically he had to go on believing. In order to pre-serve his own sanity, he had to believe something that appeared insane—he had to hope thatsomewhere, somehow, somebody was out there who would comprehend the truth.The reader may ask: What about professional people who were not part of theestablishment, and what about the general public? Did they not react strongly to the ordereddestruction and censorship of literature, to what amounted to book burning? And if not,why not? With a few exceptions they did not, for a variety of reasons. There was relatively lit-tle publicity about the injunction. Nor did Reich’s refusal to appear in court win him sym-pathizers, as would have been the case had he put up a spirited, well-publicized defense.Moreover, only a few thousand people at most had any idea of the rich scientific, medical,educational, and sociological material contained in the journals and pamphlets the FDAordered destroyed. The professional world and the public took the FDA’s word for it: thesecontained instructions for the construction and use of,or advertisements for, worthlessaccumulators. True, many found it inconvenient to have Character Analysistemporarilyunavailable while, presumably, Reich deleted references to orgone energy. But well beforethe injunction, psychiatric teachers had strongly advised young psychiatrists not to read thelast, added chapters in the third edition of this book—sections which, as in the case ofschizophrenia, made many references to orgone energy. The “silent generation” of thefifties followed this advice. There was no widespread dissatisfaction with the medical andpsychiatric establishments, no “holistic medicine,” no—or little—questioning of receivedopinion. And with Joseph McCarthy riding high, civil libertarians had more comprehensibleproblems on their hands than the eccentric Reich and his ludicrous “box.”However, the atmosphere of the 1950s and Reich’s quixotic defense are insufficientexplanations for the lack ofoutrage over the burning of his publications. In the subsequentthirty years, long after the departure of McCarthy and of Reich, few expressions of indig-nation have been heard.Jerome Greenfield’s detailed study of the FDA investigation wasgreeted in 1972 with few reviews and a small sale. In a study sponsored by Ralph Nader in1970, James S. Turner gave some details on the FDA’s “vicious campaign” to discredit Reichand his ideas 38, but that is the only substantial reference to the injunction and its aftermathbeyond the circle of Reichian adherents.In short,the Reich case has not entered public consciousness as a civil libertiesscandal of the first magnitude. Yet there have been few other instances of the American fed-eral government’s instigating, ordering, and, as we shall see, executing the conflagration ofserious scientific literature. It can be argued that only a scientist can pass judgment on theefficacy ofthe accumulator. But one does not need to be a scientist to be outraged by theburning of books. Why the strange apathy? I must conclude once again with Reich’s expla-28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 397éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"nation: People’s fear of spontaneous movement not only prevents the serious study of hisnew paradigms; it also blocks anger toward those who take steps to destroy the evidence forthe concepts.The Arizona Desert Expedition: October 1954-April 1955Reich’s successful cloud-busting efforts to modify mild droughts in the Northeastled him to believe he might be able to do something to reverse the more severe drought anddesert development in the Southwest. Consequently, during the summer of 1954 he madeplans for a trip to explore the Arizona area, including sending McCullough there in advance.As with so many activities during this period, there was a double motivation for Reich’sArizona mission. On the one hand, he was pursuing an investigation stimulated by earlierfindings. On the other hand, desperate for a way out of the FDA dilemma, he was proddedby the wish to achieve something dramatic. He became more interested in publicity than hehad ever been in the past. If his work could become widely known, the chances for over-coming the injunction would increase.The planned trip added to Reich’s financial burdens. The estimated costs wereabout $2,000 per month to cover research expenses as well as the living needs of Reich, Eva,William Moise, Robert McCullough, and eleven-year-old Peter, all of whom were making thetrip. In addition, there were maintenance costs at Orgonon, where Tom Ross was to remainas caretaker. In the face of a dwindling income from accumulator rentals, Reich organized afinancial committee consisting of Elsworth F. Baker, Michael Silvert, and William Steig.Baker, as we have seen, always played a quiet, supportive role. He was highly trust-ed by Reich, even with the most confidential private matters concerning Ilse and Eva. Inturn, Baker always treated Reich with great respect. He offered independent views, and,unlike Silvert, was very much in favor of fighting the injunction in court. However, he didnot flatly disagree with Reich very often as Wolfe, Reich’s most outspoken colleague, haddone; nor was he prepared to do anything in opposition to Reich. Ilse Ollendorff has arguedthat the New York physicians, led by Baker, should have intervened, even without Reich’sapproval, at the time of the initial complaint to represent their interests as members of theWilhelm Reich Foundation.However, such an action would have left Reich feeling totallybetrayed.Silvert’s role at Orgonon increased with the expedition. His talents at this time weremuch in need.He was prepared to give considerable time to administrative matters and hewas ready to visit in Arizona if necessary. His intense interest in the cloud-busting work alsodrew him closer to Reich.William Steig had become a key person in raising funds for orgonomy during thepost-injunction period and, especially, for the Arizona expedition. He continued his inde-pendent artistic career and remained in New York City, but he had grown closer to Reichafter the Oranur experiment,in which he took a great interest. He kept reports on DOReffects or rough approximations of what today would be called pollution levels in NewMyron SharafFury On Earth398éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"York, which he sent regularly to Reich.I have not yet described Bill Moise. His quiet, steady, warm temperament, com-bined with his loyalty and diligence, made him a valuable aide-de-camp to Reich. As apainter, he was sensitive to the atmospheric nuances Reich emphasized during this period.Bill tended to absorb equally Reich’s sound and bizarre ideas; in his case, this seemed to bedue more to naivete than a desire to curry favor. Bill provided a fine balance to his morevolatile wife, and a solid, playful source of support for young Peter, who loved him dearly.There was some tension between those who worked closely with Reich in Maine,such as Eva and Bill, or who followed him absolutely, such as Silvert and Steig, and the NewYork physicians, led by Baker, who were often uncomfortable with certain of Reich’s posi-tions, especially his dealings with the FDA. However, when Reich issued orders everybodyfell into line, with greater or lesser importance. Increasingly, Reich saw himself as a generalwith lieutenants, sergeants, and privates in his small army. At the very least they were lockedin a life-and-death struggle against the emotional plague on earth; possibly they were at warwith space men. Like a general, Reich demanded and usually obtained total obedience fromthose around him *.A very proud member of this stalwart group was Reich’s son, Peter, eleven yearsold at the time ofthe injunction.Peter has so well described his relationship with his fatherin A Book of Dreamsthat to go into it here would only dilute it. Suffice it to say, they werevery close. Reich always or almost always seems to have treated Peter with great tenderness. Peter was the only personwho could cajole Reich out of his angry moods. Peter has related the story of coming homewith his mother after a movie during the post-injunction period. While they were away, thewater pipes had burst. Reich was furious, blaming Ilse for the trouble. Peter quickly said:“Let me take a picture of you while you are angry. You look good”—a move that defusedReich’s rage39.Reich burdened Peter with his plight just as he shared his joys with his son. Peterhas recalled Reich’s showing him a 45-automatic kept in the lower cabin and saying that hemight have to use it on himselfshould he be unable to face imprisonment. Reich cried atthe time, and Peter was one of the few people who saw Reich cry in those last years. For allhis emphasis on Peter’s having his own career, freely chosen, his father undoubtedly encour-aged Peter’s vision of himself as a member of Reich’s army, and a future worker in the field.Just as he saw Eva at ten years old as a Communist youth leader, so he saw Peter as a cos-mic engineer in apprenticeship. And Peter relished the role. Moreover, Reich, especially inthe last years with Ilse and after the separation, tended to treat Peter in a fashion similar tothe way the young Willy had been treated by his father after the mother’s death as his best28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 399éditionsles atomes de l’âme*The associations of his name to Kaiser Wilhelm and the German nation itself were —never more embodied inhis behavior than during this time. The Yugoslav film director Dusan Makaveyev, who made a film about Reich in1971,has remarked that for a German-speaking boy to have a name like “Wilhelm Reich” at the turn of the cen-tury is comparable to a French child of the same period bearing the name “Napoleon France.”"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"friend and “closest confidant.”On his side, Peter generally relished the closeness with his father. However, hehated the fights between his mother and father. At Christmas 1952 he was so upset by theirquarrels that he gave neither of them a present. Decades after these events he felt the emo-tional burden of his father’s plight: he could cry more easily for Reich’s loneliness during theearly 19505 than he could for his own childhood pain40. It is also sad that for all Reich’semphasis on the “children of the future,” two of his own children, Eva and Peter, were tobe troubled into adulthood by their divided loyalties to and their contrary identificationswith very disparate parents.There was one other person who was very important to Reich during the period ofthe Arizona trip. That was my wife at the time, Grethe Hoff. As mentioned in Chapter 2,Reich and she had started a relationship during the fall of 1954 which left me feeling upsetand doubly betrayed. Much of Reich’s situation during that period was reflected in his movetoward Grethe Hoff. He was a very lonely man. His social circle was restricted to co-work-ers and students. (The women around him were likely to have been ex-patients or marriedto associates; although Lois Wyvell had been in neither category, Grethe Hoff was in both.)Characteristically, Reich was prepared to take the consequences of his actions. He was seri-ous in his commitment to Grethe and had no intention ofconducting a casual or illicit affair.At a later time, he wanted to marry her.Still, Reich’s step was a reckless and impulsive one. I describe it thus not simplybecause he disrupted people’s lives, including the life of our one-yearold son. Such a disrup-tion would have been justified had Grethe Hoff truly loved him and vice versa. However, aslater became clear, Hoff was more in awe of Reich the teacher and former therapist than inlove with Reich the man. It takes no great analytic insight to perceive that the thirty-year-oldGrethe saw in the fifty-seven-year-old Reich a substitute for her own powerful, magneticfather, to whom she had always remained inordinately attached. Reich knew all this and didnot know it. If love is blind, so also was Reich’s need. Deprived of any consideration fromthe larger world in his last years, Reich in turn could often show a ruthless inconsideratenessand sense ofentitlement toward his colleagues and students.There was another curious aspect to Reich’s love life at the time. When Hoff wasdebating whether to join him in the late fall of 1954, Reich mentioned to her that he wasdebating whether to ask Marguerite Baker, Elsworth’s wife, to accompany him on the trip toArizona.Perhaps he expressed this wish in order to make Grethe jealous *. However, hehad earlier indicated a romantic interest in Mrs. Baker. (I have no evidence that she recipro-cated these feelings, though she held and holds Reich in high esteem as a scientist.) Understress,his infantile Oedipal wishes were reignited, with the triangle now consisting of the“father” taking the “sons’” wives.After an intense emotional upheaval lasting several months, Grethe Hoff decidedMyron SharafFury On Earth400éditionsles atomes de l’âme*Baker only learned ofReich’s thoughts about Marguerite when, to compound an already entangled situation,Grethe Hoff consulted with Baker in December as to whether she should join Reich."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"to live with Reich shortly before Christmas 1954. Reich had already left for Tucson onOctober 18. He drove west with Eva, while Peter went with Bill Moise in one of the cloud-buster trucks.The preparations for the trip, the trip itself, and events in Arizona were written upby Reich in 1955 in an unusual document entitled Contact with Space (published in 1957). Isay “unusual” because the book was submitted as part of Reich’s court appeals of his later“Contempt of Injunction” verdict. Only a very limited number of copies of this work wereavailable. The book was also extraordinary because of its content. Written under great pres-sure and disorganized in structure, it blended wild speculation about space ships and blastsat the FDA as well as other enemies with remarkably sensitive observations and acute con-ceptualizations of the relationship between orgone energy and DOR41.In his description of the trip west, Reich is at his very best. He carefully noted theenvironment—weather, landscape, pollution en route. Reich had learned to bring to thelandscape the same observational acuity which he had long brought to the observation ofpatients. He could let the expression of the landscape impress him and then render it inwords. As he put it: “A landscape has an expression and an emotional flavor like a humanbeing or an animal. To learn to know this flavor and to live with itin good comfort takes time,patience,absence of prejudice and arrogant know-it-allness, or similar attitudes adverse tolearning.”42Thus he described traveling down through Virginia:From the mountain ridge at the “Skyline Drive” we saw for the first timethe “Desert Armor. “... On the ridge, vegetation and trees looked sparkling, healthi-er, greener than down in the valley... Below the ridge, one could see the DOR-layerall formed, covering the earth to the distant horizon like a blanket, with a sharplydelineated upper edge; beneath it the details of distant views were hidden in anopaque veil,as it were...As the ridge road rose over peaks and dipped down intopasses,one could subjectively feel the abrupt descent into the DOR layer: as a sud-den pressure in head or chest, a sour taste in the mouth... . One could also observethat while the trees sparkled and stood erect above the DOR ceiling, they drooped,were withered, and looked dark below it...43.When Reich arrived in Arizona at the end of October, he rented a house in Tucsonwith a large amount of land, calling this base of operations “little Orgonon.” There he con-tinued with the development of cloud-busting, augmenting it with material called “Orur.”Orur was a milligram of radium from the original Oranur experiment contained in a leadcasing. Its long soaking in an orgone energy atmosphere had given it particular propertiesthat,in Reich’s opinion, vastly augmented the efficiency of the cloud-buster.Even before the Orur arrived, flown behind a specially chartered plane with Silvertcoordinating the shipment, Reich had been busy for some weeks with the cloud-buster. Heclaimed to have increased the natural humidity considerably. But he found it much harder to28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 401éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"make rain in Arizona than in New England. He described himself at one point as being“angry” that he was not more successful. Again, there was the dual urgency for scientificachievement and for dispelling the injunction some way, somehow.By January 1955, there was considerable rain in the Southwest, which Reich attrib-uted to his operations. One day the humidity at Tucson Airport rose to 96 percent. Most ofthe evidence Reich presented for the increase in rainfall is anecdotal. There is no careful eval-uation of the amount of precipitation during the period of his efforts compared to theamount of precipitation in previous years.January 1955 was also the month of a fateful decision taken in the Northeast.Silvert had a large truckload of accumulators and literature shipped from Orgonon to hisown address in New York City. From there, he was later to distribute both accumulators andliterature. The rationale for Silvert’s action was that the previous November Judge Cliffordhad declared that the injunction pertained only to Reich, Ilse Ollendorff, and theFoundation, not to the orgonomic physicians unless they acted in concert with Reich. Yetthese actions made Silvert along with Reich a defendant in the later trial for contempt of theinjunction.Silvert and Reich argued subsequently that Silvert acted on his own and that Reichknew nothing about his decision prior to the shipment ofthe materials.I find it hard toaccept such a version. It seems incredible to me that Reich knew nothing about the plan.That would be inconsistent with the Reich I knew, for whom no event connected withorgonomy could be viewed with anything less than close attention. Had Silvert genuinelytaken it upon his own to act as he did without prior consultation with Reich, Reich wouldprobably have had nothing to do with him thereafter.Bill Moise never knew exactly what went on between Reich and Silvert, but his bestreconstruction of events was that Silvert did discuss the transfer in advance with Reich.Moise believed Reich took the position that if Silvert carried out his plan, he was acting onhis own responsibility44. In short, Reich gave a qualified green light. I also would speculatewith some confidence that Silvert pushed hard for the particular course of action he fol-lowed.Later, Reich was to say privately that Silvert wanted to kill him. But it was unfair ofReich to blame Silvert then and unfair of Reich’s followers now to blame Silvert for the dis-astrous legal course Reich pursued. If Silvert’s “hard-line” policy prevailed over more mod-erate advice, it was ultimately Reich who chose which advice to follow.Shortly before Silvert’s action, an FDA agent, along with a federal marshal, visited“little Orgonon” on December 30, ostensibly to see if Reich was manufacturing accumula-tors on the property.Reich refused to see the inspector, telling the marshal that he wantednothing to do with the FDA,though he had nothing against the marshal or the marshal’soffice. Reich erroneously attributed the FDA’s visit to its desire to gather information aboutthe Orur, which had arrived a few weeks earlier45.During this period, Reich was making many assumptions about his work and aboutpeople,some ofwhich would prove realistic while others were the irrational products of oldpsychic conflicts exacerbated by current emotional stress. Unfortunately, Reich never hadMyron SharafFury On Earth402éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"the opportunity to correct his illusions of the 1950s in the way he had corrected earlier oneswhen there was more time for peaceful reflection.At the end of April 1955 Reich left Tucson, arriving back at Orgonon in early May.The expedition suffered one casualty. Robert McCullough had a stroke in Arizona attributedby both Reich and McCullough himself to his cloud-busting work so he withdrew and wenthome to Utah to recover. His relationship with Reich remained amicable.Not long after Reich’s return to Orgonon a new blow struck, one that he had court-ed. On June 16, Peter Mills, at the request of the FDA, instituted contempt of injunctioncharges against Reich in the U.S. District Court for the state of Maine. On the same day,Judge Clifford issued an order to the defendants—now Reich, Silvert, and the Foundation—to appear in court on July 26, 1955, to show cause why legal proceedings should not be ini-tiated against them.28 : The FDA Injunction and Reich’s Responses: 1951-1955 403éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"29 : Background to the Trial for Contempt of Injunction: 1955-1956 The summer of 1955 at Orgonon was lonely and harassing for Reich. Eva and BillMoise were living in Hancock, Maine. Peter had returned to Sheffield, Massachusetts, wherehis mother now lived. The only associate Reich saw regularly was his devoted caretaker, TomRoss.Grethe Hoff left Reich late in June. He had been very loving to her, yet there wereepisodes of unfounded jealous rage. At times he was furious at her for what he alleged tobe her contempt toward various aspects of his work. Like Ilse, Grethe could not under-stand—nor would she parrot—Reich’s mistaken ideas, such as that Air Force planes wereprotecting him. Indeed, she was so upset by his blatantly erroneous notions that she won-dered whether he was equally mistaken in his cloud-busting work, or even in those aspectsof his work such as orgone energy itself that she had previously thought sound. Once againReich reacted negatively to all criticism from someone close, and once again that person wasnot prepared to work arduously at distinguishing between her rational or irrational reactions(or so he concluded). Hoff was also disturbed by his isolated, endangered situation and bythe discrepancy in their ages. She wanted a more normal existence, a desire Reich ascribedto her “will to smallness.” Finally, she decided to return to Norway that summer.For some weeks Reich wrote to her imploring her to return. He apologized for hisearlier angry outbursts. Still, he believed her main reason for leaving was that she was “run-ning away,” not from him but from herself. When she remained firm in her decision to stayin Oslo, his depression did not last long. Soon enough his energies refocused on his workand legal battles.First,he had to prepare for the July 26 hearing to show cause why legal proceed-ings against him for contempt ofthe injunction should not be initiated.During this periodhis main legal adviser was Charles Hay don, the one lawyer among several Reich consultedwho managed to maintain a relation of some solidity and duration with Reich, a very unusu-al client.Haydon had first met Reich in the spring of 1954, when he was being consideredby the New York physicians to represent them. On this first visit to Orgonon, he made afavorable impression on Reich by noticing a smell. Reich asked him what he smelled.Haydon described an acrid odor. Since Reich believed this was a characteristic smell ofOranur, he was pleased with Haydon’s response. As he said, he could tell that Haydon wasquite “open and unarmored.”1Thereupon began a long and from Haydon’s viewpoint very valuable relationship.Myron SharafFury On Earth404éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"The two men argued frequently about how the case should be conducted, but Haydonrespected the way Reich pursued the argument even if he didn’t always agree with it.One of the points of contention was Reich’s basic tenet that the courts lacked juris-diction over science. Haydon told Reich that he agreed with the position, but legally it didnot work that way and Reich could not change it. Also, there was the problem that some-body had to protect the public against real fraud. Reich’s position was that while the courtsdid not have jurisdiction over “legitimate science,” they didhave jurisdiction over “illegiti-mate science.” In an interview with me, Haydon made the point that Reich never reallyunderstood the democratic process; he had an elitist notion of how things should be, with“rational” people like himself determining what was legitimate and illegitimate science.Given Reich’s viewpoint that the courts lacked jurisdiction, he would not acceptHaydon’s proposal to appeal the original injunction since this would be acknowledging thecourt’s authority. Haydon had wanted Reich to appeal on some kind of “special basis,” butfor Reich that was just a “technicality.” Again and again the issue of technicalities came upbetween Reich and Haydon. Reich kept saying he wasn’t going to play the “game of techni-calities,” while Haydon maintained it was the only game in town.What did Haydon learn for his own professional life from Reich? One lesson wasthat,in Reich’s words, “people cannot lie”; one way or another, through grimace, bodymovement, or whatever, the truth emerges. Reich attributed such revelation to “the energyof truth.” Apparently, this affected Haydon’s life and his practice of law. For example, incross-examinations, he found that while witnesses were well prepared to defend themselveson central issues, they would reveal the truth, if questioned cleverly, on peripheral matters.Reich’ appreciated this technique.Haydon was also impressed by Reich’s critique of the criminal justice system. Reichwas against labeling people criminals; that was dealing with symptoms rather than causes. Hewanted to see boards of social psychiatry established to get to the root causes.As for his own case, Reich experienced some dissatisfaction with Haydon’s viewand attempted to engage another lawyer to represent him at the July 26 hearing, withHaydon representing Silvert and the Foundation. Reich was especially interested in obtain-ing a lawyer more supportive of his basic position in matters of natural science and moreprepared to raise the issue ofwhat Reich regarded as the conspiratorial aspects of the FDA.I am not sure who recommended James St. Clair of the law firm of Hale and Dorr, Boston.In any case, St. Clair decided not to take the case. He believed that Reich had had the oppor-tunity to raise the kinds ofissues that concerned him but had not taken it.St. Clair in turn suggested Frederick Fisher of the same law firm. (A year earlier, atthe time ofthe Army-McCarthy Hearings, Fisher had been viciously attacked by JosephMcCarthy for some youthful left-wing activities, a fact that did not disturb Reich for all hisRed Fascist emphasis of those days.) Initially, Fisher was as reluctant to take on the case asSt.Clair had been.He believed Reich had defied the injunction and was guilty of contempt.However,after a subsequent telephone conversation with Haydon, Fisher, now intrigued,agreed to appear at the hearing.29 : Background to the Trial for Contempt of Injunction: 1955-1956405éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"The hearing was scheduled for the afternoon, in Portland, Maine. During the morn-ing, Reich met for a conference with a small group of associates Drs. Baker, Raphael, Duvall,Handelman, Sobey, and Anderson; Michael Silvert, James Willie, Eva, William Steig, thelawyers Haydon and Fisher, and me. I was present because in the late spring of 1955 I hadbegun working for Reich again, now on a part-time basis from Boston. My main task con-sisted of preparing material for publication and keeping historical records.Using notes I made at the time, let me summarize some of the points Reich made.He wanted his lawyers to help him get through to the factualissues: the fact of the conspir-acy behind the injunction, the fact of orgone energy, the fact that the emotional plagueenmeshed everyone. He said that as long as they stuck to legal, procedural issues, they wouldnever get through. Furthermore, the emotional plague was infinitely better at this kind ofmaneuvering.Reich emphasized several times that the doctors should be aware that they were thefirst physiciansof the emotional plague, that this was an awesome responsibility, that theplague was an epidemic and more devastating than any disease in the history of mankind.What they would have to learn was to bring the plague out into the open, to bring charac-ter analysis from “the little therapy office” onto the public scene, and to practice “social psy-chiatry.”He was grateful for the rich experiences he had had in fighting the plague, gratefulthat decades ago he had broken away from a narrow private practice. Now he felt that hewas returning actively to the public fight for these issues, as he had done during his sex-eco-nomic period.One physician raised the question: Given the fact that his opponents were in des-perate need of social psychiatry, but were “reluctant patients,” how did one get through tothem? Reich saw it as a question of hitting through their armor, of “drawing out the humanbeing in them.” Whether to do this all at once, or slowly, depended on what transpired. Itwas a question of knowing how to operate, like a skilled surgeon, and for this operation “noknife has been invented yet.”I am impressed still by Reich’s lucidity and depth. With the major exception of hiscontinued assertion ofa Red Fascist conspiracy, his remarks and under this kind of pressurestand the test oftime. Unfortunately, there was no way these particular insights could beraised in court or be effective there.At the hearing,Reich, Silvert, and Moise (representing the Wilhelm ReichFoundation) were the defendants. About twenty of Reich’s supporters were present in thecourtroom.Joseph Maguire and Peter Mills represented the government. Maguire was a tall,pale, dour man, though not the vicious-looking creature one might have expected fromReich’s delineation ofthe FDA. It was strange to see Mills—short, bland, and smiling—rep-resenting the government after his participation as lawyer for the Foundation in many can-did discussions with Reich. Judge Clifford was white-haired, gaunt but kindly-looking.Haydon presented his arguments first. He also opposed, on constitutional grounds,the FDA’s right to subpoena Reich’s files. Maguire spoke next simply and fairly factually. Hewanted to get rid of the accumulators, as the injunction had decreed. Reich wouldn’t let him,Myron SharafFury On Earth406éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"Silvert wouldn’t let him; they refused entry to FDA agents who had the job of carrying outthe injunction. The FDA wanted to eliminate the “worthless” accumulators. (Reich shot astern look at Maguire in response to the pejorative adjective.) Reich and Silvert were asked to stand and plead “guilty” or “not guilty.” Reich start-ed to say a few words at this point, but was told by Fisher that his statement should be madeafter the plea. Reich had an aversion to the legalistic form of the plea, as he was to explainlater. He finally said “not guilty,” as did Silvert. Then Reich asked to say a few words. Thejudge nodded.Reich went to the front of the courtroom and, standing, spoke briefly but forceful-ly. He began by explaining that it was impossible factually to plead either guilty or not guilty.What the injunction demanded was impossible to fulfill. He could not get the accumulatorsback even if he asked for them. He could not get the literature back—it was in the hands ofpublishers all over the world. The accumulators, the books, his discoveries were on their way,far into the world, and it was impossible to fulfill an injunction that ordered him to do any-thing about it.Reich also explained why he had not appeared in court originally. Among his rea-sons was that basic science must remain outside the jurisdiction of the courts, and it was forthat principle that he was fighting.At one point Reich turned directly to Maguire and said: “You are not honest!”Maguire had cited one letter from Reich to Baker, a letter published in a limited edition ofConspiracy2. He asked Maguire why he had not cited other material, such as the Brady arti-cle, from the same volume. He also accused him of deliberately and maliciously using as acourtroom exhibit an old, dilapidated accumulator rather than a new one, in order to makeReich look like a fraud.Reich’s voice shook with emotion when he confronted Maguire directly. As hisemotions mounted, Fisher anxiously got up in order to warn Reich not to go too far.However, the judge, who was kindly to Reich throughout, gently beckoned him and Reichquickly restrained himself.He told the judge that he had gone too far and would retract whathe had said.Reich went on to tell Maguire that he no longer thought he was the main forcebehind the injunction and that the FDA was behaving better these days, they were no longerbadgering patients.Reich became very strong and vehement again when, directing his words toMaguire,he said that no matter what they did to him—jail, chains, fine—he would neverpermit Maguire to say anything about orgone energy and the accumulator. Matters of sci-ence were not to be decided in court; the court could not say whether the universe wasempty or full oforgone energy. When thathappened,there was no longer any freedom inthe United States—this was the way it was behind the Iron Curtain. Reich spoke movinglyof Giordano Bruno’s fate, Bruno who had been hunted down for seven years by a mannamed Mocenigo and who finally died at the hands of the Inquisition. Centuries later, aPope apologized at Bruno’s grave. Amid such courageous sentences Reich also spoke non-sense, with references to his support in high government circles.29 : Background to the Trial for Contempt of Injunction: 1955-1956407éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"There was one very human moment when Reich, talking about the Foundation,turned to Peter Mills and said, smiling: “Do you remember when we formed the Foundationtogether, Mr. Mills?” After Reich’s statement, the judge said he would examine the lawyers’briefs.I rode back to Boston with Fisher, who remarked that he had never seen a day incourt like it. Still, his main objective was to find a way to “settle the case.” He thought hecould get an agreement with the court permitting Reich to do anything except send accumu-lators into interstate commerce. Reich would never have agreed to such a plan, but Fisher’sstand was: “I’m an expert in law and it is on those grounds that Reich must swim or sink.”Fisher’s insistence on legally sound procedures soon led to his leaving the case.A further pre-trial hearing took place on November 4, which I also attended. Thesame people appeared, with two exceptions: neither Haydon nor Fisher was present, thoughHaydon continued to serve as a consultant. Reich had decided to be his own counsel.At this hearing, Reich presented a motion to establish a “Board of SocialPathology” to examine the whole case on an educational and medical level. The chemically-minded, the orgonomically-minded could sit down together peacefully and assess the facts.In a switch of emphasis, Reich said that this proposal assumed the FDA had acted out ofignorance rather than malice.The judge asked Maguire if he had anything to say. Maguire said he had not beenlistening. The judge ruled that he lacked the authority to establish such a board.Reich’s next motion concerned various misrepresentations by the FDA. The judgeruled that all such issues belonged in the original hearing when Reich had not appeared;there was no further recourse.Reich had taken various other rulings with equanimity. However, this new rulingclearly hurt. He asked, almost pleadingly, if there was no opportunity now to go into theseissues. There was not, repeated the judge. Reich said he could not appear at the originalinjunction hearing without “being smothered,”that he had to prepare his evidence. Reichkept changing his reasons for his original nonappearance, an indication to me that he wasnot presenting his essential motives,namely, his pride and his fear of being humiliated.The judge also ruled favorably on FDA subpoena requests for various Foundationrecords.When Reich heard this ruling, he said he did not know whether to obey; issues ofconscience were involved. The judge firmly asserted that this was a court order. Reich hadalways acted with the utmost sincerity, so he did not believe Reich would ever consciouslydisobey an order ofthe court. Reich replied: “I understand. I know what the word ‘obey’means.” He went on to say that if he gave any information to the FDA, he could not takeresponsibility for what might happen.The judge said he understood and the responsibilitywould be the FDA’s and the court’s. He seemed quite relieved that Reich would comply withhis ruling on the subpoenas.In spite ofthe legal defeats, Reich left the courtroom in surprisingly good spirits.He looked forward to more ofthe issues coming out in the trial for contempt of injunction,a trial scheduled to come before a full jury because Reich was charged with criminal con-Myron SharafFury On Earth408éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"tempt.During the summer and fall of 1955, consumed as he was by legal matters, Reichalso continued his scientific work, devoting considerable time to the DOR-buster. In lateAugust that year he held a seminar on the subject, at which I was present.Reich’s mood was serious, but I recall being impressed by how little the injunctionitself was discussed. He was concerned with DOR and its relationship to unimpeded natu-ral orgone energy, and conducted clinical demonstrations that involved a combination ofpsychiatric techniques with the use of the medical DOR-buster (see Chapter 26). In thosedays he was especially alert to gray or “dark” coloring in a person’s face or body—for himan indication of the accumulation of DOR. “You look black,” was one of the descriptionshe would apply to people. There were fewer smiles and jokes than there had been at pastconferences; the mood was grim at times. Reich had some kind of throat problem, so hewore a scarf at his neck. The scarf, along with his wool shirt and khaki pants, highlighted hisresemblance to a guerrilla chief.It was at this time that I resigned my part-time position with the Foundation. Onefactor was my disagreement with Reich over his emphasis on the Red Fascist role in obtain-ing the injunction;there were also the personal reasons discussed earlier.I was never aware of Reich’s loneliness during the summer of 1955, but others sawit. Gladys Meyer met him inadvertently in the main Rangeley shopping area. When she askedhim how he was, he answered with uncharacteristic self-pity that he was eating out of cans.(Reich did not like to cook for himself, nor did he particularly enjoy eating out. He felt staredat in Rangeley restaurants.) Meyer offered to bring dinner to Orgonon. Reich accepted.When she arrived with a picnic-style meal, she found him dressed rather formally in a suitand tie, which was not his usual style. By that time the large first-floor room of theObservatory had been redecorated and included fine furniture and rugs. Reich talked ofhow high government officials might visit him. He played the organ and spoke of rereadingThe New Testamentand Rousseau’s Confessions. For Meyer, the evening had an elegiac, disturb-ing quality.She was touched by Reich’s reaching out for contact but worried by his illusionsconcerning prominent visitors.Gladys Meyer saw not only Reich’s loneliness but also his rage. On one occasionthey again met accidentally in Rangeley and Reich asked her to go for a drive with him. Inthe course of the conversation, she mentioned a loan Wolfe had made to Reich. AfterWolfe’s death, Gladys Meyer had told Reich to forget about it, but upon further reflectionshe now felt that her daughter (ten at the time) might later need the money. Erupting in rage,Reich took Gladys back to her car. Two hours later he went to her cabin and apologized3.Gladys Meyer’s request for the return of her husband’s loan joined other indica-tions that many of his students were no longer prepared to give him the degree of supportthey had once extended. The educator Alexander (“Tajar”) Hamilton, who for years hadstudied with Reich and corresponded warmly and admiringly with him, began to rebel in thepost-Oranur period. On June 23, with the trial in the offing, Hamilton wrote Reich that he29 : Background to the Trial for Contempt of Injunction: 1955-1956409éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"found “everything that has come out of Orgonon since Oranur... rationalized defensesagainst untenable positions.”This kind of indiscriminate criticism was no more helpful than the attitude of othercolleagues who always found Reich right no matter what he did. But responses likeHamilton’s indicated to Reich that many were abandoning him.Ilse Ollendorff has written of Reich’s mood that summer:With the loneliness and frustration ... his basic optimism must have fal-tered. Reich must often have sensed that the final outcome might be rather grim.His health was not good; his heart was bothering him ... He had always been con-cerned about what would happen to his remains if he should die, and he now beganto prepare in earnest for a tomb—or mausoleum—at Orgonon ... [There was] onespot on the hill where the observatory was built, where often before he had said hewould like to be buried. He now had Tom Ross, the caretaker, begin digging out aplace for a tomb4.Reich was not totally without consolation during the summer. At the seminar onthe DOR-buster,he met Aurora Karrer, a woman of thirty-one at the time. As a biologistwho was employed by the National Institute of Health in Washington, Karrer had long beenan admirer of Reich’s. I met her only twice briefly and spoke just a few words with her5. Shewas very attractive, dark-haired, resembling the Tahitian women in Gauguin’s paintings,which Reich greatly admired.An intense relationship developed. Aurora Karrer seems to have rekindled a depthof romantic feeling Reich had not experienced for many years, an intensity heightened byhis perilous legal predicament. However, there were difficulties, the precise nature of whichI do not know save that they included Reich’s old problem of jealousy. His angry outburstswere frequent and Karrer would sometimes leave him unpredictably6.In spite ofall Reich’s legal strains and personal upheavals in the post-injunctionperiod, his flow of scientific publications did not cease. As mentioned in Chapter 28, Reichin 1955 changed the name ofthe Orgone Energy Bulletinto CORE(standing for cosmicorgone engineering) to reflect his continuing work. In 1954, he published one large issuedevoted to problems of weather modification and drought, with a report on his experiencesup to the Arizona expedition; in 1955, two more issues ofCOREappeared. The first con-tained a description of his trip to Arizona. It also included a preliminary paper by Reich onsome ofhis chemical investigations concerning DOR.The same issue contained a summary by Chester Raphael of a small seminar onDOR-sickness that Reich had held at Orgonon on August 26 and 27, 1953- Reich made sev-eral important distinctions at this conference that merit a brief description.He distinguished between Oranur sickness and DOR-sickness. “Oranur sickness”referred to the organismic response to the experimental use of radium in an atmosphere(Orgonon) highly charged with orgone energy. The Oranur experiment provided a way ofMyron SharafFury On Earth410éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"understanding the global “DOR-sickness.” The latter stemmed from a variety of irritants orpollution, which changed orgone energy into a malignant force.The effect of pollutants on orgone energy, transforming it into DOR, in turn ledto DOR-sickness in man. Reich also stressed that DOR-sickness brought out latent and spe-cific emotional vulnerabilities within individuals.In the second issue ofCORE, published in December 1955, Reich continned hiselaboration of themes presented in Raphael’s summary. Reich’s emphasis here was on thebuild-up of DOR through the armor. Orgone energy that could not circulate freely withinthe organism was transformed into DOR, just as atmospheric orgone energy was when irri-tated by pollutants. During his Arizona trip, Reich was struck by parallels between the phys-ical desert there and the emotional desert in man. The bristles of desert plants, the pricklyouter behavior of armored human beings—this is the kind of analogy Reich was drawn toin his last years.In Arizona, Reich had seen the desert fight hard, so to speak, against his cloud-busting activities. The removal of DOR, the bringing in of fresh orgone energy meant anend of existing secondary desert vegetation. Similarly, the discovery of orgone energy, aswell as of the armor, meant eventually an end to the complex, armored, “secondary” formsofliving in man.Reich used his understanding of DOR to comprehend in greater depth oneof his earliest clinical concerns, latent negative transference and negative therapeutic reac-tion. His latest formulation posited that armored people dimly knew the “dirty feelings”their armor contained. The negative transference could be viewed as a heightening of aware-ness in the face of the threatened therapeutic exposure of the dirtiness. Nonetheless, theroad to health required a revelation of this “sequestered realm of the self.”7Reich’s various selves were functioning to the end, and in his best moments, as inthis paper, he could stand aside from pettiness and rage; he could, despite gross harassment,clearly strive for that sober pursuit of truth that characterized all phases of his life in spiteof recurrent “little man” outbursts. He could put aside extravagant claims in order to pres-ent a lucid argument in a tone that was deep and quiet.Reich may have been quite wrong about the role of DOR in the atmosphere andthe organism. However, I must repeat my conviction: his paradigm, with its unification ofman and nature and its energetic model of life and death, holds such possibilities that itbehooves us to find out how right or wrong it is. To paraphrase Pascal’s wager, we lose moreby failing to pursue orgonomic hypotheses with all due speed should they eventually proveto be correct than we do by testing them thoroughly only to find they are worthless.Another issue ofCOREcontained a compilation by Eva Reich of clinical materialfor a uterine case Reich had followed since 1942. This was the only medical report on accu-mulator usage published by Reich after the injunction. He gave the FDA nothing, for thearticle, in defiance of the injunction, showed positive results from the use of the accumula-tor. After two months of treatment, the patient felt considerably stronger8.Most significant was Reich’s recommendation back in 1943 that the patient’s uterusbe removed. He had recommended this step on the basis of various orgonomic tests. The29 : Background to the Trial for Contempt of Injunction: 1955-1956411éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"patient’s gynecologist, who used classical criteria of cancer diagnosis, had been against a hys-terectomy. In 1947, an emergency operation was performed on the patient, but the uteruscould not be extirpated because by then the tissue had become too brittle for suture. Thepatient died that same year. Reich believed the outcome confirmed his original diagnosis, butone could not say whether the removal of the uterus in 1943 would have prevented death9.At the same time, the outcome was far from optimistic. Perhaps she died because the rec-ommended classical technique (surgery) was notused on the advice of a classical physician.Thus, Reich hit the FDA twice: the accumulator worked andhe was not against other treat-ments for patients, notwithstanding the FDA’s repeated assertion that his patients weredeprived of legitimate treatment.During 1955, at Reich’s suggestion, Elsworth Baker began to edit and publish thejournal entitled Orgonomic Medicine. It was devoted to clinical, social, and educational subjects,leaving COREas the publication for natural-scientific research. Two issues ofOrgonomicMedicinewere published in 1955, one in 1956. Determined to keep track of developments inall his work, Reich remained in close contact with Baker about the journal. The FDA mustnot stop orgonomy.In November 1955,Reich took up winter residence in Washington, D.C., living atAlban Towers, 3706 Massachusetts Avenue. Probably the most important reason was to benear Aurora Karrer. Other factors were undoubtedly his absorption with legal issues, hisdesire to be close to the center of American government, and the fearsome isolation ofRangeley winters. Aurora spent considerable time with him. Eva and Bill Moise often cameto Washington to be near Reich, while Peter visited during his school vacations. Reich andIlse had maintained a friendly relationship after their separation and both participated in anydecisions concerning Peter’s welfare.To protect his privacy, Reich lived under the assumed name of Walter Roner10.(The court, as well as all his associates, knew his whereabouts.) Living in a large city againgave him an anonymity he enjoyed.Unlike Rangeley, he could now go places without beingnoticed.And even though the forthcoming contempt trial was imminent, he appears to havesought out relaxation more than at any other time in the American period. He sent Peter acopy ofthe program for a performance at Constitution Hall of the Westminster Choir onFebruary 25, 1956, which he probably attended with Aurora. Pieces by Mozart, RandallThompson,and Tom Scott were circled with the notation “very good.”Reich loved the city of Washington. Its classical architecture and total design great-ly appealed to him. On Peter’s vacations they both enjoyed exploring the city and its sub-urbs.Reich thought he might one day acquire a home in Maryland or Virginia; Peter evenhas a photograph of one particular house Reich wanted to buy.Reich lived quite comfortably in the Alban Towers and ate in good restaurants.Indeed, after the injunction, he permitted himself more creature comforts than he had donefor decades.He had already refurnished the first floor of the Observatory, and for Ms tripto Arizona he bought an expensive white Chrysler convertible.Myron SharafFury On Earth412éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"It was characteristic of Reich to expand his scale of living only after he had beenaccused of swindling by the FDA. It was as though he were saying: For years I sacrificedeverything for my work and now you accuse me of running a moneymaking fraud. So Iintend to live well It was as though the sentence confronting him released personal desireshe had long restrained. He embarked on relationships with women (Grethe, Aurora) thatwere not centered upon work and a quiet routine as his marriage to Ilse had been.There is also evidence that Karrer was less submissive than most of his Americanassociates. In a letter from Washington to Peter, he commented that “people” now treatedhim more as they used to treat him in the 1920s. 1 take that reference to mean that people,especially Aurora Karrer, were less afraid of him.He was concerned about Aurora’s well-being, for example, urging Peter to try to befriendly to her. (Not surprisingly, Peter did not especially take to this woman who hadusurped his mother’s role.) And he did other things that differed from his usual pattern, let-ting Aurora drive his car while he was in it, for instance. Usually in the past, with his needfor control, he had always insisted on driving.Reich’s attentiveness to Karrer should not be taken to mean that he was about toalter any basic tenets in order to please her. At some point in their relationship, Karrer madeclear that she wished to be legally married. But after his various experiences, Reich was waryof legal marriage and the claims partners can exert upon one another, although perhaps withjail as a distinct possibility he now desired this step.However, he held to his principles about the conditions of any marriage. In January1957 he had his lawyer draw up an agreement between Aurora Karrer and himself, an agree-ment covering in detail the financial responsibilities of the two partners. It is illuminating tosee Reich, given all his legal burdens, carefully working out a marriage contract with AuroraKarrer, more in the fashion of the 1970s than the 1950s. I do not know if this contract wasever signed; but it never became operative as they never legally married.Whatever peace Reich found for himself in Washington did not last for long.Toward the end of April 1956 he received news of his forthcoming trial, to be held inPortland,Maine.29 : Background to the Trial for Contempt of Injunction: 1955-1956413éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"30 : The Trial: 1956 The trial date, originally scheduled for December 1, 1955, was postponed untilMarch 6, 1956. It was changed once more and a definite date set for April 30. Clifford, whosewife was very ill, asked to be excused from serving as judge; he was replaced by Judge GeorgeC. Sweeney1.When Reich received notification of the trial, he was upset that the notification wassigned by the clerk of the court rather than by the judge himself. Throughout the legal pro-ceedings Reich became very perturbed by such minor points, to the distress of his lawyers.In this instance, Reich wrote to Judge Sweeney on April 24, stating that if he did not receivea properly signed notification for the new trial date, he would assume he did not have toappear in court.Once again Reich took a judge’s failure to respond as a sign of agreementand thought he did not have to appear.He did have to. Reich was arrested in Washington; Silvert, who complied withReich’s interpretation, in New York on May 1. Reich spent the night of May 1 in aWashington jail. On May 2, both were brought in handcuffs to Portland, where they spentanother night in jail Reich had often said that even if “they” put him in “chains,” he wouldnot relinquish his position. Now he had brought this to pass but over a quibble. The judgelater found Reich and Silvert in contempt for not appearing on time. He fined Reich $500 andSilvert $300.The trial itself started at ten o’clock on May 3. Reich served as lawyer for Silvert, theFoundation,and himself.He had always wanted to examine his witnesses and cross-examinethe government’s should a trial occur, so there was little place for Haydon in the courtroom,though the relationship between the two men remained cordial.About forty ofReich’s friends (including Aurora Karrer) and followers were presentin the courtroom. I attended the first, third, and fourth days. Much of the following descrip-tion is based on my notes made at the time.The jury was speedily seated, with only one juror challenged. It looked like a moviejury—extremely typical of the American populace down to one black person. There wereseveral middle-aged women.Maguire made his opening address to the jury, stating that he was going to prove thatReich and Silvert had committed contempt. Reich, who along with Silvert pleaded “notguilty,” began his opening statement, attempting to convey some of the broader issues hewanted to go into,but the judge soon cut him off, telling him to limit himself to the issue ofproving he had not committed contempt. The confusion of the whole trial became manifestMyron SharafFury On Earth414éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"here since Reich was clearly not out to deny that he had violated aspects of the injunctionand that he felt he had to violate them. He was pleading innocent on deeper grounds—thatthe injunction was unconstitutional and unfairly brought in the first place.Judge Sweeney was a round-faced man who resembled Winston Churchill. He waspink, debonair, quick-minded, and there was often a slight irony to his remarks. He seemed aless kindly man than Clifford, yet much stronger and more independent. He struck me as veryfair. As impatient as he became with Maguire’s long-drawn-out proving of the obvious, hewas equally impatient when Reich tried to bring in issues Sweeney thought irrelevant, but hesoftened toward Reich during the course of the trial.The first witness called by the government was Ilse Ollendorff. She was a fine wit-ness, perhaps the clearest and most secure of any that took the stand during the trial. Shetripped up Maguire on several points: at one time when he tried to link all the literature withthe accumulator, she made it clear that only a very few pieces, such as the catalogue of typesof accumulators and the instruction sheet, went out to those who ordered the accumulator.Perhaps the weakest part of her testimony in terms of logic was her statement that Reich andshe had not complied with the injunction in the immediate months after the decree becausethe FDA had not sent anyone around to supervise its execution; it later became clear thatReich had no intention ofcooperating with any FDA agents. Still, Ms. Ollendorff was testi-fying to events that took place while she was at Orgonon.In his cross-examination, Maguire constantly tried to create a picture of a “business”activity with a sinister, racketeering connotation. He used such terms as a “drop in NewYork” and “big boss” (to describe Reich). In his cross-examination of Ilse Ollendorff, Reichset the style for most of his later cross-examinations: he would ask one or two questions forthe purpose of eliciting a factual answer. He asked her, for example, what the money fromaccumulator rentals was used for and she replied, for research, salary of employees, and soon. The question was objected to and the objection sustained, but the jury heard her answer.The next witness was an accumulator user from New York. He shuffled to the standlooking like the epitome of a deeply sick neurotic. Maguire spent a very long time (clearly irri-tating the judge) with this witness in order to elicit the simple point that he had continuedpaying accumulator rentals after the injunction had been issued. In his cross-examination,Reich asked the witness ifthe accumulator had helped or hindered him. The witness said ithad helped.Maguire objected to the question and the judge ordered it and the answer strick-en from the record.Tom Ross then testified that Silvert had taken books and accumulators fromOrgonon, evidence the government needed to establish its case that Silvert had acted “in con-cert”with Reich in violating the injunction.A man who built accumulators at the Rangeleyworkshop testified that either Silvert or Ross had taken accumulators out of the workshopafter the injunction. In his cross-examination, Reich asked the worker how he tested the accu-mulators he built. The witness mentioned holding his hand close to the walls and was goingto continue when the judge,after an objection from Maguire, ruled the question out of ordersince it bore on the efficacy of the accumulator rather than on the narrow question: contempt30 : The Trial: 1956415éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"or not contempt. After his testimony, the Maine workman made a point of going over toshake hands warmly with Reich.A federal marshal from Tucson, Arizona, then testified that he had been permittedentrance to Reich’s home in Tucson but the accompanying FDA agent had been barred. Themarshal also mentioned looking through a telescope at Reich’s property a glimmer of scien-tific instruments and events constantly flickered through the morass of technical administra-tive details (payment of checks, delivery of accumulators, etc.).On Friday, May 4, I was not present. The day was devoted to government witness-es and to proving the obvious and undisputed. May 5 continued with the government’s case.Maguire examined William Moise to show that accumulator rentals, gathered by Silvert afterthe injunction, were sent to help support Reich’s research in Arizona. Silvert was also ques-tioned about his taking books and accumulators from Orgonon, renting accumulators in NewYork, and the like. In his cross-examination, Reich wanted to have the point brought out thatSilvert had been declared exempt from the injunction during the intervention case, in otherwords, when the injunction applied only to Reich, Ollendorff, and the Foundation. BothMoise and Silvert wished to establish that Reich had notknown about Silvert’s removal ofbooks and accumulators from Orgonon, although this was, as we have seen, a somewhatambiguous point.Before the noon recess, Reich began calling his witnesses. There was a brief discus-sion between Reich and the judge as to what defense material Reich could admit. The judgeruled against Reich’s arguing the validity of the original injunction or of anything not perti-nent to the fact of obedience or disobedience of the injunction. Reich was allowed a widerrange in his summation to the jury but nowhere else.Reich’s total time for questioning defense witnesses was not more than an hour anda half. The essential point he wished to establish was that the injunction had been resisted tothe utmost, or, more precisely, that FDA agents were barred from Orgonon. McCullough tes-tified to carrying a gun and being under instructions to keep the FDA agents away. The judgeinterrogated McCullough as to whether he was actually prepared to use the gun. McCulloughemphasized its warning function,but did not preclude the possibility that certain circum-stances might have compelled its use. Ross testified along similar lines. Under questioning byReich,he also told ofbeing asked to dig a grave during the summer of 1955 and said thatReich was prepared to die resisting the injunction.Albert Duvall, M.D., testified that he would not have requested his patients to returntheir accumulators even if Reich had asked him to do so, and that Reich had an affidavit fromhim to this effect.Perhaps the most interesting examinations occurred when Reich called first Maguireand then Mills to the stand.Reich tried to establish the point that Maguire had in fact readthe Conspiracyvolume. Maguire denied that he had. With Mills, Reich had the followingexchanges:REICH: The fact that I want to establish here is only one. You were forMyron SharafFury On Earth416éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"three years—for more than three years—a good friend of ours and a counsellor? MILLS: That’s correct. I was professionally, but not intimately.REICH: There was some private contact? MILLS: Yes, a cup of coffee.THE COURT: With cream and sugar in it? REICH: That’s right!2And a few minutes later, during the same examination:REICH: My question is, under the circumstances, what reasons, or whatfacts induced Mr. Mills after being our counsel for three years, and I regarded himas a good friend, to be our opponent’s counsel, and the one to prosecute me and Dr.Silvert as criminals? THE COURT: That is a fair question if there is anything.MR. MILLS: The question is, what prompted me? REICH: What made you change your mind? MR. MILLS: I have never changed my mind. I am not conscious of chang-ing my mind.THE COURT: Wait a minute. The original question was, what promptedyou to change sides.MR. MILLS: I never changed sides ... I never advised you on matters con-cerning the Pure Food and Drug Administration3.Later that day, Reich produced minutes of a meeting of the Wilhelm ReichFoundation held in 1952 which Mills attended and at which the FDA investigation was dis-cussed.Maguire tried to make the case that once Mills was district attorney and the Reich mat-ter was referred to him by the Department of Justice, he had no choice but to direct the legalaction.The judge curtly commented: “We all know he may have assigned it to someone elseifhe did not care to sit on it.”4Undoubtedly, Mills’s role could have been exploited by Reich far more than it was,not only in the trial but in subsequent appeals. It was the one action on the government’s sidethat clearly angered Judge Sweeney. But Reich remained adamant: it was a “technicality.”During a recess on May 5, Ilse Ollendorff asked to speak with the judge5. She wasmuch incensed that Maguire had denied seeing the Conspiracyvolume.While she had beenwaiting in Portland for the trial to begin, Mills and Maguire had asked her if she would initialsome Foundation documents in order to speed up proceedings. She agreed, and in the courseofcarrying out this request, noticed with surprise that Maguire had a copy of the Conspiracyvolume.The judge then advised Ms. Ollendorff to tell Reich about the incident with Maguire,and to have Reich examine her again. Reich did so, and Maguire cross-examined her. Oncemore Maguire tried to make the point that since the material was contained in a looseleaf30 : The Trial: 1956417éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"binder, he might not have seen an identical volume when Reich showed him one. It was asmall matter but it conveyed some of Maguire’s evasion of a simple point.Judge Sweeney also asked Ms. Ollendorff whether he should request a psychiatricexamination of Reich. This might provide a way out for Reich; undoubtedly, the judge alsothought Reich genuinely disturbed. Judge Sweeney went on to say that in the face of therepeated admission of both defendants that they had violated the injunction, there was noother escape than for them to be found guilty. Sweeney added that he was sorry he had comeinto the picture so late.Ilse’s response to the idea of a psychiatric examination was strong:I very vigorously advised against a psychiatric examination. First, because itwould have infuriated Reich and all his friends to a great extent, and second, becausewhatever Reich’s delusions may have been in regard to the conspiracy or to the secretnature of his work, I felt that he was absolutely rational in the conduct of the trialso far as his basic premises were concerned, namely that scientific research shouldbe free of political interference, that he had a duty to expose the biased and malev-olent intentions of the FDA investigation which he felt to be against the publicinterest6.The final session on Monday, May 7, was brief. Maguire made a short statement tothe effect that if he had known what the defense was to be, his presentation might have beenmuch briefer. However, he had not known and he had prepared himself for any eventuality.For the defense, Silvert read an abbreviated (by the judge) version of Reich’s “Atoms forPeace versus the Hig [Hoodlums in Government]” address, which had been printed in AprilI9567. The statement repeated the arguments about the unconstitutionality of the injunc-tion.Reich himselfconcluded with a very few words to the jury. Among other things, hepointed out that he had given $350,000 from his earnings as a psychiatrist to orgone energyresearch, which made ridiculous Maguire’s efforts to prove that a $21.50 bill had been paid byaccumulator rentals.He told of his difficulties in fighting this case, how one had the feelingthat whatever one did was wrong wherever one turned there was a closed door. He told ofhis own experimental nature, how he wanted to see the way this case would develop, how heeven went to jail briefly to see what jail was like though he could have been released on bailearlier. Jail was barbarous and the people should do something about it. He thought it wouldbe a good idea ifevery member of a jury, every member of the bar, including Maguire andMills, spent a little time in jail to see what it was like. He had found out because it was hismethod to study firsthand what he dealt with. He wished his opponents had also found outwhat they were dealing with, had read the orgonomic literature and sat in the accumulator.Maguire gave a short rebuttal, concentrating on material presented in the “Atoms forPeace”address. To Reich’s statement that orgonomy was in the realm of basic research andthat the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had agreed with this statement, Maguire claimedMyron SharafFury On Earth418éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"to have a letter from the AEC indicating otherwise. To Reich’s charge that the FDA agentswere “hoodlums,” he countered citing the years of government service of these agents andaccused his opponents of being “hoodlums” for keeping the agents away at gun point.However, the most searing, stunning moment of the whole trial the moment when the fun-damental issues were joined, though they were not issues to be settled in any courtroom—came when Maguire scoffingly said: “They talk about pre-atomic, orgone energy! What’s that?We’ve moved way beyond that—we’ve got atomic energy and now we are getting the H-bomb!”In his charge to the jury, the judge spoke very briefly. He again confined the issuessuccinctly to the question of whether or not Reich, the Foundation, and Silvert had commit-ted contempt by violating the injunction. He described it as a “very simple” case; in the sensethat he defined it and as the law defined it at this point, it was indeed “very simple.” Yet ifthe entire case were considered in all its ramifications, it was about as complicated as any casecould be.Given the judge’s charge, the jury’s verdict was predictable. They returned after onlyten or fifteen minutes’ deliberation with three verdicts of guilty. Reich looked deadly seriousas the jury filed in and his seriousness persisted after the foreman announced the jury’s deci-sions.Reich patted Aurora’s arm with great tenderness.I would like to quote here the last paragraphs of my report on the trial:It was not simple, it was not totally a scientific situation, admixtures ofmany things were involved. There was something of the atmosphere of Calvaryabout the whole business and Reich may have been provoked into doing somethingparallel to what Christ had done when in desperation he asserted: “I can destroy yourtemple in three days!” and then all his enemies could gloat and say: Did you hearhim? Now we have him! He was surely wrong there. And he was wrong on one level,but not on another, the “followers” huddled around then and they huddle now. Canhe really destroy the temple? Is there really espionage? Do they want all the topsecret information? Will he be able to show them the importance of it all? And theMaguires smirk and win for the moment,the jury goes home and lives as it lived, theJudge feels concerned and worried, but what can you do? And everybody is as theywere, or are they? And here is the actual lunchtime conversation I overheard of threeMaine lawyers who followed the trial:“Say,didn’t he let the government get away with murder! Why, Charlie, ifyou or I were in there as his lawyer, the trial would have lasted at least three weeks.He would have lost anyway but it would have been a lot tougher for the government,you bet it would.”“Yeah. Say what is this ‘argonne accumulator’ [sic] anyway? Does it have30 : The Trial: 1956419éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"something to do with sex?”“I think so ... something about free love. It must be helping him. Did yousee that lovely girl with him?”“Yeah ... Well, what he should have done is fight it in the beginning. Hecould have called on all these people to say they believed in it and that it helpedthem. Oh, he could have done a lot. After all, they called the Wright brothers crazyand Ben Franklin.” ... I hope he doesn’t become another martyr for people to enjoyin the mirror. I hope Reich will live out his days. He has done and suffered enoughand it is time others took up the brunt of that burden. The work stands, they canburn the books, but the books are out, the accumulators are out in the world, theycan’t touch them. Reich found the truths he was looking for when he went into thisproblem the emotional desert, the connections involving hiding and spying andmanipulating and conniving. The problem may be scientifically exhausted just as theproblem of human misery is basically exhausted from a scientific viewpoint, thoughmany details remain to be filled in. To get this across in a big way is, one would guess,just as hopeless as was the attempt to get sex-economy across through mass meet-ings, and when one tries to get it across with a bang, one gets into things unworthyof its essential grandeur.Schiller wrote: “The strong man is at his most powerful alone.” Reich wasbasically alone during this whole injunction nightmare because he was willing to risk“contempt” of the law not only in the name of scientific freedom (on that levelalone he could have gotten more support), but because he wanted to put the emo-tional plague’s “contempt” for life in the prisoner’s dock. He tried many ways andways not always to his credit to give that bottomless contempt a communicable formand shape, to make it into a “case.”Now whatever happens he will be basically alone. If he dies, he will diealone....And ifhe goes on,somehow, somewhere, elaborating the laws of orgoneenergy and deadly orgone, with that infinite sweetness, depth and harmony, he willagain be alone, waiting for structures to grow that are capable of joining him in thatsoaring but realistic, sweeping but disciplined search. Out of a quite great ignoranceI can only say I hope he does the last, rather than dying or pouring out his strengthin an attempt to reach a jury or a judge who will not, who cannot perhaps, reach outofthemselves.The judge set sentencing for May 25, 1956. Reich and Silvert were released on bail.Reich left the courtroom in a very active, somber mood. He said that a “legal scandal” hadbeen committed, that this was just the beginning, and that he was glad at least certain issuesMyron SharafFury On Earth420éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":422,"pageContent":"had been raised in the courtroom.As he greeted colleagues, students, and followers in the courthouse corridors, heappeared very much the leader still. He said something reassuring to McCullough, wholooked very depressed after the verdict. During the trial, Reich had awarded McCullough a$250 “Oranur prize” for the best orgonomic paper of the year by a student (“The RockyRoad to Functionalism”). He was quick to show his opinion of those around him. He criti-cized one colleague for a recent book review: “You were too nice to the enemy.” Anotherauthor received warm praise. And the obnoxious, bullying side of his personality was still inevidence. When approached by one follower with a pale gray complexion, Reich commentedangrily, “You look DOR-ish,” as though the person had committed a crime.After the verdict, Reich did something unusual for him: he approached persons hethought were friends but whom he didn’t know. In one instance, he went up to a followerfrom New York, shook hands with him, and asked him if he were “one of ...” and made acircle with his hand, as if there were no quite appropriate word (“group,” “circle,” both wereinadequate and carried connotations Reich detested). The person, rather shy, said “sort of,”and Reich answered, “I know ... sort of ... kind of ...” with a mixture of sweetness and irony.My last image of Reich on the day of the verdict was of him packing his papers intoseveral briefcases,looking determined and much less depressed and helpless than most of hisfollowers.The day of Reich’s sentencing broke fair, cold and dry. The Boston Weather Bureaureported that the night before was the coldest on record for that date. But only the weatherwas unusual. Few persons noted or even knew that this was the day of sentencing. The news-papers had nothing about it, hardly anyone outside the little circle of followers talked aboutit.One entered the Portland courtroom at 10:00 A.M. to see the characters seated intheir usual places.Everyone looked almost the same as when the curtain rang down on thetrial itself. Only Peter Mills was different, paler, more fatigued. The judge, pink and unsmil-ing,entered as usual a little later than everyone else. He asked the government for its recom-mendations. Maguire rose and declared: Three years sentence for each of the two defendants,a fine of$50,000 for the Wilhelm Reich Foundation (equal to the amount of income fromthe accumulators since the injunction in March 1954), and legal costs.Before one knew what had happened, the judge in an unusually low voice for himhad passed sentence:two years prison for Reich, one year for Silvert, $10,000 fine for theFoundation. Everyone was stunned: such severity had never been foreseen. A few in the audi-ence cried,but most looked impassive with God knows what inward feelings. Reich’s expres-sion hardly flickered. Only afterward could one perceive reflected in his face some bottom-lessly deep hurt, but this was not revealed through any of the usual emotional signs. Therewere no tears, no signs of depression, fear, or guilt.Reich did not say anything then or at any point during the session. Prior to sentenc-ing, he handed Judge Sweeney a statement which the judge read aloud afterward:30 : The Trial: 1956421éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":423,"pageContent":"Your Honor:We have lost,technically only, to an incomprehensible procedure treadmill. Iand my fellow workers have, however, won our case in the true, historical sense.

I have won the battle against evil.One day the motives and legalistic maneuvers of the technical winners oftoday, the drug and cosmetic Hig, will emerge from the archives and see the cleanlight of day. I certainly prefer to be in the place where I am instead of being in theshoes of the Hig. I may suffer physical disaster, but shame and dishonor are not onmy face. It is on the face of the XXth Century Judas Iscariot, Peter Mills, whobetrayed his former friends and clients when the Oranur experiment struck us in1952, and when the Red Fascist Hig, under Moskau [sic] order, was out to get ourexperimental secrets while, at the same time, they spread poison and slander in ourpeaceful village about us.Judas hurriedly left the apparently sinking ship; in additionhe covered up his tracks by accepting the role of prosecutor for the Moskau inspireddrug Hig against his former friends and clients.In a deep sense, too, we are all guilty, bar none. We were and still are on trial,without exception, in one of the most crucial test crises in the history of man.This important subject has been presented by me in 1953, during the graveplanetary DOR emergency, as if in anticipation of the HIG assault. Here, theMurder of Christ 2000 years ago has been taken as an historical example of themethod used by the Emotional Plague of Man to kill Life and Truth.This time,however, Judas has betrayed and the Hig is killing the scientifichope to cope with the planetary disaster that is upon us. I wish to thank you, JudgeSweeney,for the fairness shown us, within the given bounds. May your knowledgehelp to improve the American judicial system to secure factual truth8.Silvert requested continuance of bail pending appeal. The judge granted this request,with the proviso that Reich and Silvert not resume the activities for which they had beenbrought to trial.Then, suddenly, incongruously, it was all over. Out of the blue, as in a dream, some-one spoke in French, representing I believe some immigrants who had not obeyed the con-ditions of their stay in the United States. The sudden shift from the most transcendent issuesto the most mundane was breathtaking: Reich’s case had ended with the same confusion withwhich it had begun.Reich talked to a few associates while still in the courtroom. He mentioned gettinga lawyer. His voice was soft. Then he and the others left the courtroom.Myron SharafFury On Earth422éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"Someone wanted to speak with Mm in the hallway and Reich replied sharply: “Yes,but the truth,please!” They talked together while the rest of us, about twenty-five people,walked out and stood in front of the building.Outside, there was a desultory, helpless quality to the conversations, as was often thecase when Reich was not present. Willie was clearly dissatisfied with certain aspects of theway the case had been handled, Tropp complimented him on always having spoken his mindto Reich whereas many others—including himself—had not. Eva Reich talked excitedly aboutgiving talks in the community, which would describe her father’s work and the factual histo-ry of the FDA case without trying to prove anything. Her points were good ones, but it allsounded too easy, William Steig and his wife, Kari Homestead, who was also very devoted toorgonomy, tried to be helpful. Soon most of Reich’s followers, feeling helpless and depressed,dispersed.At two o’clock in the afternoon I was invited to a discussion held in a conferenceroom at the Lafayette Hotel where Reich was staying. Reich, Raphael, Silvert, Steig, AuroraKarrer, Eva and Bill Moise were sitting around a table. Reich began by stressing how theorganized Red Fascist plague played upon the fears and conflicts of the average person toachieve its ends. He could not understand why I did not perceive the connection between RedFascism and the attacks against orgonomy. My position was that the FDA injunction andother assaults had in common the general fear and hatred of orgonomy, but that I could seeno clear evidence of any organized conspiracy. This statement elicited expressions of shockand dismay from some of those present, but Reich quickly silenced them: “He may be right.”I cite this exchange because it so vividly illustrates how Reich could allow a note ofdissent from someone like me, who was now not working with him, that was not permittedto those closer to him. It is also an example of how Reich could at times put rein to his moreaberrant notions. Finally, I mention it because on this occasion I spoke not only frankly butwarmly and Reich could often take that kind of disagreement.Reich was concerned about whether the sentence would mean “the end.” He said atone point: “I know what they will do to me in prison,” implying that they would make it intol-erable for him.The seriousness combined with the sense of humanity, the concern butabsence ofself-pity with which Reich discussed this possibility were impressive. I never sawhim more human than on that day.Reich asked whether there was anything irrational in his thinking about the case. Histhoughts were focused on the Red Fascist conspiracy, on the one hand, and support in highplaces,on the other. I said that I thought the irrational element was Reich’s deep but unreal-istic desire to make contact with present-day social organizations. Reich quietly replied thathe had always hoped—“I hoped for the psychoanalysts, I hoped for the communists. I hopefor you. Have I been a fool?” The question was addressed more to himself than to anyoneelse.May 26 was the last time I saw Reich.30 : The Trial: 1956423éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"31 : The Destruction of Orgone Energy Accumulatorsand the Burning of Reich’s Publications: 1956-1957 Any hopes that Reich would revise his legal strategy after the trial were soondashed. He continued with the same kind of arguments he had used in the pre-trial hearingsand at the trial itself. He did re-engage Charles Haydon as lawyer, although only to preparea brief for the Foundation. Silvert was to submit his own brief.The brief that Reich submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals in October 1956 con-tained his old assertions about a conscious, organized conspiracy against his work, althoughon this occasion he granted a larger role to pharmaceutical and other commercial intereststhan he did to the Red Fascists. For the first time in a legal paper, he introduced the erro-neous notion that the U.S.Air Force was fully aware of a motor power in orgone energy.Even while Reich was making extremely irrational statements, he was also assertingwho he was more plainly than ever: “The injunction did not concern a routine case of fraudulent pro-duction to deceive the public. It was, on the contrary, the most crucial discovery ever made in nat-ural science by an acknowledged, widely-known scientist and physician, arbitrarily misrepre-sented to the court as a quack and fraudulent crook.”1The briefs by Haydon and Silvert essentially followed Reich’s position. In addition,Silvert emphasized that he had not acted “in concert with” Reich in shipping accumulatorsand orgonomic literature, and that the literature did not constitute “promotional” materialfor the accumulator.On December n,1956,the Court ofAppeals issued a four-page decision affirmingthe view ofthe District Court. In answer to the argument of FDA fraud, the decision stat-ed that even a fraudulent injunction had to be obeyed until it was legally overturned.The rejection by the Court of Appeals hurt and angered Reich, but he soonbounced back with renewed hope for a final appeal to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court briefs submitted by Reich, Silvert, and Haydon containedexpansions on previously presented arguments with one major addition: Reich submitted hisvolume Contact with Space, as an appendix to the briefs. It is rather extraordinary that heshould have done so since Contact with Spacedoes not deal at all with the specifics ofthe FDAcase. In his last appeal, Reich maintained his course: the FDA became just one theme in hiscontrapuntal melody of life against death (or pollution, armored human beings, and emo-tional plague attacks like the injunction).Even while the appeals were in process, the destruction of accumulators andReich’s literature began. There was little Reich or Silvert could do to prevent this measureMyron SharafFury On Earth424éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"since the stay of execution of their sentences depended upon their compliance with theinjunction.On June 5, 1956, two FDA agents accompanied by a federal marshal arrived atOrgonon to supervise the destruction of accumulators. They were met by Reich, Silvert, andtwo Maine attorneys who were helping Reich to deal with the immediate problem of exe-cuting the destruction.Reich and Silvert informed the agents that most of the accumulators out on rentalhad been sold to the users. Ten accumulators plus panels in need of repair for about twen-ty-five more were in Sil vert’s possession in New York. There were only three accumulatorsat Orgonon.A contretemps then ensued as to who would destroy the three accumulators. Reichand Silvert wanted the agents to take the ax themselves. The agents claimed the injunctionrequired the defendants to carry out the destruction. Reich and Silvert yielded on this point.The agents then wanted the accumulators and panels in Silvert’s control in New Yorkreturned to Rangeley and destroyed. They also asked that the sold accumulators be recalled.One of Reich’s lawyers maintained that this did not have to be done since Reich and Silverthad already been penalized by their sentence for these sales.Jerome Greenfield has described Reich’s attitude during this discussion:No doubt from Reich’s point of view all this discussion must have seemedlike a negotiation of surrender terms between two warring countries. Though hemade an effort to remain calm and reasonable, occasionally he broke out into bit-ter accusations, got up, paced about, went out of the room briefly and returned.“Their attitude,” the FDA memo of this operation stated, “seemed to be that ofmartyrs. The Food and Drug Administration could take and destroy everything theyhad.”2Moise and Tom Ross carried out the actual destruction.At first they tried to burnthe accumulators, but this proved impossible. Then, joined by Peter Reich, now twelve, theytook axes and began chopping up the accumulators and panels. In his book, Peter has givena harrowing description ofReich’s emotions during the destruction and afterward. When theaccumulators had been axed, Reich said: “Well, gentlemen, are you satisfied now?” and Petercontinues:He waited for a moment. It was perfectly quiet except for some crows onthe maple next to the barn.“Would you like to burn it now?”The marshall took his hands out of his pockets.“No, Doctor, I think that will be sufficient.”“Are you sure?”His cheeks were red and his eyes burned.“Yes, Doctor, I think that is plenty.”31 : The Destruction of Orgone Energy Accumulators and the Burning of Reich’s Publications425éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"“We have gasoline!

Why not?”“No, Doctor, please.” The three men tried to walk away from him but theywould have walked right into the woods so they kind of walked sideways to theircar. One of them took a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his forehead.He looked at the sky. The other man licked his lips. The marshall kept trying to lookat Daddy but his eyes kept dropping.“I have more instruments!” Daddy’s voice was sharper and made themwince. “Yes, gentlemen. Instruments. Scientific equipment. Would you like to seethat on the pile too? No?”The marshall and one of the men walked around the far side of the blackcar and got in quickly. The other man, the driver, tried to walk around to the doorbut Daddy was in front ofhim. He stood in front of Daddy with his head lowered.Daddy just looked at him. After a long time, the driver raised his head and lookedat Daddy and then he dropped his head again.“Excuse me, Doctor. Please.”“Yes, I’ll excuse you. Of course.” He stepped aside and the man twistedpast him and got into the car.Daddy turned around and looked at him in the window.The driver leaned out. His face was white.“Doctor. I ... I’m sorry.”“Yes.You’re sorry. Of course. Aren’t we all? Goodbye, gentlemen.Someday you will understand.”3The next destruction occurred on June 26. The FDA’s records list 251 pieces of lit-erature burned on that day. A memo by an FDA agent states: “We went into the students’laboratory and Reich said, There they are, burn them.’ “ The actual burning was carried outby a workman from the company of S. A. Collins and Sons, the firm that had originally builtthe accumulators.The items burned included copies of the Orgone Energy Bulletin,The Orgone EnergyAccumulator,the International Journal of Sex-economy and Orgone Research,Emotional Plague versusOrgone Biophysics,Annals of the Orgone Institute,The Oranur Experiment, and Ether, God and Devil.The FDA agent’s report commented: “During the burning, Dr. Reich found him-self just about to throw some of the literature on the fire. He stopped short and remarked,T promised myselfthat I would have nothing to do with the burning of this literature.’”4Reich told the agent that his books had been burned in Germany but he never expected itMyron SharafFury On Earth426éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"to happen again.On July 9, the first non-Reichian organization attempted to stop the destruction ofthe literature. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) protested this particular part ofthe injunction in a letter to the FDA. Later, in December 1956, the ACLU issued a pressrelease criticizing the burning of Reich’s books. The release was never published by anymajor U.S. newspaper. (The same “death by silence” occurred in England, where a letter ofprotest signed by A. S. Neill, Sir Herbert Read, and others was not published in any news-paper.) Reich himself stopped further intervention by the ACLU. That organization hadapproached Reich and Hay don to be of help during the period of the Supreme Courtappeal, but Reich told Haydon to have nothing to do with it5. He refused help for severalreasons. In his mind, the ACLU was connected with suspect leftist causes. Furthermore,Reich was irritated by persons who became upset by the destruction of literature but whoaccepted the destruction of accumulators. Finally, Reich never fully agreed with—or he hadserious reservations about—a basic tenet of the ACLU, free speech for allideas, right orwrong, rational or irrational. As ever, Reich stressed the protection of the rational in humandiscourse.About fifty accumulators, those that Silvert had in New York and had shipped toRangeley, were destroyed by the S. A. Collins and Sons on July 23. The next destruction oforgonomic materials occurred on August 23 in New York City, when six tons of literature,valued at around $15,000, were burned. The materials included many of Reich’s hard-coverbooks (e.g.,The Sexual Revolution,The Mass Psychology of Fascism), which the injunction hadonly ordered withheld until references to orgone energy were “deleted.” Now, on thegrounds that the books had been “shipped in interstate commerce” when Silvert originallymoved them from Rangeley to New York, the FDA also ordered these books consigned tothe flames. Greenfield has commented: “In making this decision, apparently at his own dis-cretion, Maguire illegally abrogated to himself the function of interpretation that properlybelonged to the court that had issued the injunction.”6Silvert and some others actually did the book burning since again the FDA agentswere only supposed to supervise the operation. Victor Sobey, a medical orgonomist whoparticipated, described the scene in a letter on September 24, partly as follows: “I arrived atthe stockroom at 7:30 A.M. on August 23. ... All the expenses and labor had to be providedby the [Orgone Institute] Press. A huge truck with three to help was hired. I felt like peoplewho, when they are to be executed, are made to dig their own graves first and are then shotand thrown in. We carried box after box of the literature.”7Like Freud, Reich always perceived the depth of the hatred toward his work as asign that it touched vital nerves. In the summer of 1956 that hatred raged in very visible,concrete acts ofdestruction.Reich was in direct regular contact with only a few people after his sentencing onMay 26.He kept up his correspondence with Baker, Raknes, Hoppe, and Neill, but his let-31 : The Destruction of Orgone Energy Accumulators and the Burning of Reich’s Publications427éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"ters were few. His withdrawal from people was increasing.Tom Ross was with him for only part of the summer; there were no longer fundsto pay for a caretaker. In addition, with the general decline of research activity there was lessneed for his services. Reich had to scrape up money to pay legal costs, although the NewYork physicians continued to help out. On June 21, Baker made a note: “Reich today calledto say he is selling WRF [Wilhelm Reich Foundation] assets to place in a legal fund ... to paycounsel and fine.” Reich sold at least one fine Reichert microscope, as well as other piecesof scientific equipment.During the summer of 1956, Aurora Karrer was with Reich a good deal of thetime. However, there continued to be severe quarrels when she would leave unexpectedlyand stay away from him for several days. Reich experienced considerable anguish as a resultof these separations8.There were tense moments with others close to him, such as A. S. Neill. During thesummer of 1956, Ilse and Peter visited England, where they saw Neill often. At the time,the twelve-year-old Peter was very much under the influence of his father’s beliefs in poten-tial danger from Red Fascists and space ships. The boy also shared his father’s convictionabout the benevolent protection of the U.S. Air Force. Neill and Ilse’s brother RobertOllendorff(a physician deeply interested in orgonomy) were especially concerned whenPeter would say on sighting some U.S.A.F. planes above: “They are there to protect me; theyare looking after me.”9Neill wrote Reich that he found Peter too serious, too far removed from boyishpleasures. At first Reich seemed to have taken this letter in stride, simply counseling Peterlater that the two of them were aware of things Neill was not. However, Neill’s reaction toPeter—probably combined with other differences of opinion between the two friends—ateinto him. That October, Neill was visiting Norway where he saw Grethe Hoff. Reich wiredHoff that Neill was no longer to be trusted.With his usual integrity Neill wrote Reich on October i,saying how much it sad-dened him that Reich no longer found him trustworthy. He went on to add that he was nota disciple or an enemy but one of Reich’s few real friends. And he spoke his mind frankly inexpressing his concern about Peter10.It was not the end of their friendship. On October 15, Reich replied to Neill’s let-ter:“Can you be patient for a while until I am free to talk to you? Do not worry.” It is unfor-tunate that Reich did not get more letters like the one from Neill; he needed them.There was only one close colleague, Ola Raknes, who suggested seriously to Reichthat his personal conflicts might be affecting his legal position. But Raknes’ advice came late,after Baker had telegrammed him the news of Reich’s sentence. On May 29, Raknes wroteReich a letter, parts of which went as follows:... I have on a couple of points had the feeling that your estimates werenot rationally founded. The documents published ... have not convinced me thatthere is a “conspiracy”in the literal sense of that word (a “breathing together”).Myron SharafFury On Earth428éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"Your enemies and persecutors no doubt have several sources of inspiration in com-mon ... but I do not think they have concerted their action so as to make it a con-spiracy.

If and how such alatent conflict has influenced your attitude in later conflictual situations in life, Ithink you will know better than I if you just try to find out... .On June 22, Reich replied that Raknes was wrong in denying a conspiracy betweenthe pharmaceutical companies in the United States and Red Fascism. Early in January 1957(when Reich’s appeal was before the Supreme Court), Raknes commented that “every hon-est means is permissible if you can thereby free yourself from the dirty tricks of the FDA.”Reich replied on January 14 that he refused to employ “legal tricks.”On January 17, Reich wrote his last letter to Raknes. Its main point concerned a ref-erence in a paper by Raknes to the fact that Reich’s father was “Jewish-born.”11Reichacknowledged this but described at length how his father had moved away from “Jewishchauvinism” and reared his children in a progressive, international way. Reich himself didnot follow Jewish customs or beliefs and he did not wish to be categorized as a Jew despitethe conventional practice in this matter.It is interesting that Reich, facing an imminent jail sentence, should have devotedsuch attention to the question ofbeing “Jewish-born.” In part, it belongs to his final effortto clarify the historical record; it is also another manifestation of his angry reaction againstbeing forced into any position not ofhis own choosing. However, in addition, it seems toreflect some unresolved feelings about being Jewish, particularly when he was under severeattack. Part of Reich never really wanted to be an “outsider,” the quintessential Jewish role,as he had been from his medical school days on as an eastern European immigrant inVienna. He was never more an outsider than during his last years even while he yearned foracceptance by “high government officials.” And he never wanted more not to be a “Jew.”In November 1956, Reich left Orgonon, never to see it again. He settled in AlbanTowers for another winter. Eva and Bill also lived in Washington for the winter, and Petervisited Reich during the Christmas vacation.31 : The Destruction of Orgone Energy Accumulators and the Burning of Reich’s Publications429éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"Most of Reich’s efforts went into preparing briefs for the Supreme Court after thenegative decision of the Court of Appeals on December n. It was a grim and lonely period.Peter has mentioned the quality of “waiting” that suffused their mood—waiting for somekind of intervention that would dispel the nightmare of Reich’s imminent prison sen-tence12. Reich often said that if he went to jail, he would die there. He was preparing his lastwill during late 1956 and early 1957.There were moments of relaxation. Peter recalls seeing two western movies withhis father in one day. Ilse and Reich continued to talk on the telephone and correspond.Reich wanted Peter to carry on in public school. Ilse agreed in principle but thought thatunder the circumstances a private Quaker school in Poughkeepsie, New York, would be bet-ter. Ilse’s wish prevailed.Reich always liked to celebrate Christmas, but the celebration of 1956 was a sadone. Reich, Aurora Karrer, Bill, Eva, and Peter spent at least part of Christmas Eve inReich’s suite. There is a snapshot of Reich during that evening, dressed in a tuxedo. He hasa highball in his hand and a bottle of liquor on the desk in front of him; the desk is coveredwith books and papers and a tall plant stands in front of it. Reich’s look in the photo is inde-scribable. There is just a trace of a smile, but it is a very tentative one. His eyes are brightyet questioning and plaintive. Their expression reminds one of the last scene in City Lights:Chaplin has helped a blind girl obtain an operation through which she has recovered hersight. Now for the first time she sees her tramp-benefactor. Chaplin watches. What will herreaction be? He hopes for the best, but fears the worst. So it is in this photo of Reich. Yethe would remain his own man to the end.The sense of abiding by his principles and winding up his aifairs in as clean a wayas possible was apparent from Reich’s dealings with the orgonomic physicians in his lastmeetings with them. In January 1957, Reich arranged to see about twelve doctors (in somecases singly, in others two at a time) to discuss their future role in orgonomy and any prob-lems.Morton Herskowitz,who saw Reich with Dr. Charles Oiler, told me about his lastvisit with his teacher13. One of the issues Reich emphasized was the length of patient treat-ment.He asked the two men how many patients they had had in treatment longer than threeyears. Each gave his answer. Reich then asked them to consider terminating those cases. Heimplied that to keep patients in treatment more than three years without significant changewas a mistake. Herskowitz was amazed that Reich could be concerned about this on theverge of going to jail.He wanted to know what problems both had. They mentioned one physician whothey felt was destructive. Reich said: “Why don’t you get rid of him?” According toHerskowitz, this question was consistent with Reich’s general attitude toward the doctors;they should make their own decisions and govern themselves.Baker, who saw Reich alone toward the end of January, put a different constructionon Reich’s handling ofthe particular interpersonal problem Herskowitz and Oiler hadraised. According to Baker, Reich himself told this physician and one other that they did notMyron SharafFury On Earth430éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"“belong in orgonomy.”14Both Herskowitz and Baker found him quite calm in their last meetings together.Baker felt that for Reich his organizational involvement in orgonomy had come to an end,regardless of whether he went to jail or not. Reich had in mind taking a long vacation, per-haps in the American West, perhaps in Switzerland. He would continue to think and writebut he would not lead an organization.Most of the physicians Reich had trained remained loyal, helping with the heavyfinancial legal costs even though many of them felt his particular way of fighting the casewas doomed to failure. Reich expressed little personal bitterness toward them, but general-ly he felt that most of them did not really have contact either with his essential orgonomicthemes or with him. At bottom, despite all his resilience, he was very tired of people andwanted peace for his own thoughts.Given the situation, Reich conveyed a sense of “the end” to Baker in their lastmeeting. With Wolfe gone, Baker was the orgonomic therapist destined to carry on the tra-ditions of Reich’s treatment. According to Baker, Reich asked him at that meeting if Bakerwould assume responsibility “for the future of orgonomy.” Baker said he would. Reich askedhim whom he would like to help him. Baker proposed one physician. Reich vetoed thischoice and instead proposed Albert Duvall and Eva. Baker accepted. That was the last timeBaker was to see Reich.Reich left considerable ambiguity about his official intentions as to which peoplewere to carry on leadership in orgonomy and the extent of their responsibilities. Thus, in hislast written will, signed February 10, 1957, Reich designated Eva as the executrix of hisarchives, a powerful position since the executrix controlled the republication of Reich’sbooks as well as the unpublished papers. In prison, Reich appears to have reconsidered Evaas executrix15.Reich could not entirely envision orgonomy without him; he often said he wantedno successor.This aversion stemmed in part from his fear that anyone with power in orgon-omy might build up an organization inconsistent with the truths of orgonomy, as hebelieved the Church to have done to Christ’s principles, the Communist parties to Marx’s,and the psychoanalytic organizations to Freud’s.More was involved, for Reich could not let go of the work. Although he often saidhe would die in jail, he was optimistic for the future, as we shall see. And in the early monthsof1957, part of him refused to believe he was going to prison.That part of Reich was wrong. On February 25, 1957, the Supreme Court decidedagainst reviewing the decision of the lower courts. Reich and Silvert sought for suspensionor reduction of their sentences. Judge Sweeney ordered a hearing for March n, with jail tofollow if suspension was rejected.Even before the Supreme Court decision, Reich seems to have become more des-perate than ever to strike back at his opponents, especially Maguire and Mills. Eva, BillMoise,Silvert, and Reich himself phoned and appeared at FBI offices to convince theagency that espionage was involved in this case and that Maguire and Mills had committed31 : The Destruction of Orgone Energy Accumulators and the Burning of Reich’s Publications431éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"perjury. Reich sought a personal meeting with J. Edgar Hoover. None was forthcoming. TheFBI simply informed Mills and Maguire of each move16.On March 10, Reich and his associates took rooms at the Lafayette Hotel inPortland, where the hearing was to be held the next day. William Steig and Moise asked thelocal police if a cell was available to make a citizen’s arrest. They undoubtedly had Mills andMaguire in mind. The officials tried to get Steig and Moise to back off from this plan, whichonly reinforced the government’s conviction that extra security precautions should be takenfor the hearing itself. According to Greenfield: “A federal marshall and his three deputies, adeputy and guard from Bangor, Maine, two FBI agents, a number of employees in theFederal Building and men from the Immigration Division were consequently interspersedamong the people in the spectator seats. Besides this precaution, Maguire, after the hearing,was escorted by two FBI agents to the Maine Turnpike for his trip back to Washington.”17At the hearing, each side was given fifteen minutes to present its argument.ThePortland Evening Expressof March n reported Reich’s words as follows:He pleaded against being imprisoned, saying that if the sentence were car-ried out, it inevitably would deprive the U.S. and the world at large of his equationson space and negative gravity.These equations, he said more specifically in his written motion, are car-ried only in my head, known to no one on this planet. This knowledge will go downwith me, maybe for millennia, should mankind survive the present planetary DORemergency.It would mean certain death in prison of a scientific pioneer at the handsof psychopathic persons who acted in the service of treason against mankind in asevere planetary emergency.It would amount to gross neglect of duty of the court with regard to alllegal facts on official record in this case.Reich also asserted that he and Silvert were devoted to the promotion of newknowledge,not a cancer cure. “We are not crooks, not criminals,” he concluded, “but coura-geous people.”Judge Sweeney ordered that Reich and Silvert undergo psychiatric examinationswithin sixty days, after which the motion for reduction of sentence would be considered.We know that Judge Sweeney had been considering such a psychiatric examinationfor Reich during the trial.The psychoanalyst John Murray, an admiring student of Reich’s inthe 1920s (see Chapter 6), has also told me that Sweeney, who was his neighbor and golfingcompanion, devoted considerable thought to what he should do about Reich’s sentence. Thejudge liked Reich, but he was deeply committed to the American system of justice, and Reichhad flagrantly and knowingly violated the law. Sweeney sought Murray’s advice about Reich’smental status.From what Sweeney said, and from seeing some of Reich’s recent writings,Murray concluded that Reich was paranoid and an “adamant crusader.”18Myron SharafFury On Earth432éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"Judge Sweeney later wrote to the U.S. Board of Parole that he had been stronglyinclined to suspend or reduce the sentence but the government (Maguire and Mills) con-vinced him that Reich and Silvert would continue the “orgone business” if not sent to jail19.There is one further bit of information bearing on Judge Sweeney’s thinking about Reich’sfuture intentions for the accumulator. According to Moise, Reich signed a statement priorto being transferred to a federal prison20. The statement was to the effect that orgone accu-mulators would not be distributed ifhis sentence was suspended or reduced. (Moise’s mem-ory is not exact as to what this statement said.) I have not been able to confirm whether or not Judge Sweeney ever received any-thing from Reich about accumulators prior to the imprisonment. Indeed, it is impossible toconfirm absolutely that there was such a document. We do know that Maguire and Mills keptpushing their view of the future—“they will continue the orgone business”—on JudgeSweeney and that he bowed to it.After a night in the Portland jail, Reich and Silvert were driven on March 12 to thefederal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, by two deputy marshals. Greenfield has comment-ed on the trip to the federal prison: “In the car, Reich and Silvert sat handcuffed in the back,discussing weather conditions and observing the state of vegetation they passed.”2131 : The Destruction of Orgone Energy Accumulators and the Burning of Reich’s Publications433éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"32 : Prison and Death: 1957 Reich stayed at Danbury Federal Prison for ten days. On March 22, he was movedto the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, while Silvert remained at Danbury.At Danbury, Reich had had his first psychiatric examination, carried out by RichardC. Hubbard, M.D., a psychiatrist who was a consultant to the prison staff1. According toGreenfield, “the examination consisted of an interview lasting about an hour.” A young psy-chiatrist at the time, Hubbard was an admirer of Reich’s. It must have been a strange expe-rience for him to “evaluate” so renowned a psychiatric teacher.They spoke about orgonomy and about the conspiracy against it. At one point inthe conversation, Reich heard the sound of an airplane. He rose and went to the window.Then,turning to Hubbard, he “informed him that the plane was flying overhead because ofhis presence in the prison, as a sign that he was being protected. Hubbard did not know whatto make of this. He had had prisoners deliberately say outlandish things to be thought unbal-anced so as to invalidate a sentence, but he did not believe Reich would try such a trick.” Atthe same time Hubbard felt that Reich must surely have realized that any psychiatrist, any-body in fact, would interpret what he had just said as a delusion. Hubbard finally conclud-ed that Reich really believed what he had said about the Air Force plane.Toward the end of Hubbard’ s interview, Reich asked him what the diagnosis wasgoing to be. Hubbard apologetically explained that, “given Hubbard’s background, he couldonly conclude that there was a definite disturbance.” Reich’s response was a thoughtful nod,as ifin agreement with Hubbard that within traditional realms (psychoanalysis, classicalphysics),many of his concepts and findings would have to be considered insane. Reich stillcould not grasp that some of his ideas could not be construed as rational at all Hubbard’sbriefreport on Reich went as follows:Diagnosis:Paranoia manifested by delusions of grandiosity and persecution and ideasof reference.The patient feels that he has made outstanding discoveries. Gradually overa period of many years he has explained the failure of his ideas in becoming uni-versally accepted by the elaboration of psychotic thinking. “The Rockerfellows (sic)are against me.” (Delusion of grandiosity.) “The airplanes flying over prison aresent by Air Force to encourage me.” (Ideas of reference and grandiosity.) The patient is relatively intact in the greater part of his personality thoughMyron SharafFury On Earth434éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"there is enough frank psychotic thinking to raise the question as to whether thediagnostic label might more appropriately be Schizophrenic Paranoid type. In gen-eral his emotional responses and behavior are consistent with his ideas. No halluci-nations were elicited.Discussion:In my opinion the patient is mentally ill both from a legal and psychiatricviewpoint, hence should not stand convicted of criminal charge.Treatment:Observation in a mental hospital.So at Hubbard’s recommendation Reich was moved to the federal penitentiary inLewisburg, where there were better psychiatric facilities, and where he was examined oncemore. The Lewisburg Board of Examiners stated:During the interview, Reich’s emotional responses and general demeanorwere consistent with his expressed ideation. On occasions he elaborated upon cer-tain theories which are not accepted generally by scientific circles but are adheredto by certain groups which appear to be in the minority... .The following represents the consensus of the Board of Examiners...1. During the interrogation, Reich gave no concrete evidence of beingmentally incompetent. He is capable of adhering to the right and refraining fromthe wrong.2. Although he expressed some bizarre ideation, his personality appears tobe essentially intact.3. In our opinion, it is felt that Reich could easily have a frank break withreality, and become psychotic, particularly if the stresses and environmental pres-sures become overwhelming2.Ilse Ollendorffoffered a charitable interpretation of the conclusion made by theBoard of Examiners:The psychiatrists did not feel that much could be gained by re-opening theentire case for reasons oflegal insanity, and second, they felt that a man of Reich’sstanding should not be made to suffer from the label of legal insanity. I think thislatter decision was an honorable one, and I am convinced that Reich himself wouldhave fought very hard against re-opening the case with a plea of legal insanity3.Reich was not alone in opposing the idea of insanity; Maguire and Mills also wereagainst it. On this one point the three stood in total accord. For the prosecution it wouldhave been very embarrassing to find they had convicted a mentally ill person. Indeed,Maguire went to great lengths to prove Reich’s behavior sane.32 : Prison and Death: 1957 435éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"Greenfield believes the Lewisburg Board of Examiners was more concerned withprotecting the FDA than it was with protecting Reich’s feelings. Greenfield is probably right.If one believed, as the Board of Examiners did,that there was nothing valid in Reich’s scientific discoveries—orgone energy andthe orgone accumulator—then their diagnosis was easy. Reich had a major psychosis, withdelusions such as protective air planes only the peaks on a mountain chain of gross emo-tional disturbance. It speaks for the depth of the hatred not only of the FDA but of theBoard of Examiners that they could come up with any other assessment.The same vindictive spirit was evident in the Classification Study made of Reichupon his arrival in Lewisburg Prison. The social worker’s report stressed that Reich, a “60-year-old divorced white offender, does not embrace any religion nor is he a member of anychurch.” The case worker also emphasized that “family ties are almost nonexistent,” a state-ment that required a peculiar definition of “family ties” since the report also stated that twoof the three most important people to Reich were his daughter Eva and his son Peter (thethird person being Aurora). The case worker must have based this judgment on Reich’s state-ment that “he does not believe in the marriage laws of the U.S.A. and that they should notapply to him. He should be free to live with whomever he pleases.”4The chiefprobation officer for Maine had conducted an inquiry on Reich prior tohis imprisonment. In his report, the officer warned: “It is noted that while operating in othercountries the defendant always had contacts which would allow him to move to new terri-tory. It is understood that he has developed contacts in Canada and South America, possi-bly in anticipation of exhausting all means of carrying on further in this country.”5This misreading of Reich’s motivations by the probation officer continued theMaguire tradition of viewing Reich as a kind of Mafia chief looking for “new turf.”The probation officer concluded his report:He [Reich] is a man ofgreat ego and vanity. He cannot submit to seeinghis little kingdom destroyed. The only means he seems to find of perpetuating him-selfat this point is to present himselfto his followers as a martyr to the theory oforgone energy. The defendant has openly defied the court. In the course of thisinvestigation it was learned that there are many accumulators in different placeswhich the defendant has made no attempt to destroy, dismantle, or recall.There are no attenuating circumstances and the defendant states openlythat he will continue to violate the order of the court6.The FDA continued to hound and defame Reich even after he was imprisoned. Thewarden ofthe Lewisburg prison, J. C. Taylor, requested a report on Reich from the FDA toassist in determining how Reich should be treated in prison. The FDA report, which wouldbe used when Reich came up for parole, consisted of an eight-page letter written by G. S.Goldhammer,an assistant director.Myron SharafFury On Earth436éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"In an intentional effort to influence the prison officials to take a tough line withReich, Goldhammer thoroughly distorted the information his own agency, the FDA, hadcollected in cooperation with the U.S. Department of State about Reich’s Norwegian trou-bles. In 1952, a member of the U.S. Embassy in Oslo had conducted quite careful and objec-tive interviews with Reich’s friends and foes in that country7. He came to the conclusionthat much of Reich’s work was held in high professional esteem, although his bion researchwas generally considered invalid. Yet all the complexity of the embassy officer’s report wasdropped by Goldhammer.Reich’s day-to-day relations in the prison community were far less tempestuousthan any of these reports would indicate. For example, the social worker said Reich was“contemptuous of authority.” However, the prison record cited no evidence of his disobey-ing prison rules or failing to meet any of the requirements of prison life. Nor was there anyevidence that he made a habit of asking for “special treatment,” as the Classification Studyhad predicted. All he asked for was Vaseline for his skin condition, which had erupted again,and the opportunity to take baths several times a week during a period when he was both-ered by the heavy DOR atmosphere. Both of these requests were granted. The prison per-sonnel seem to have treated Reich quite decently. He was given a work assignment in theprison library, a fitting task8.The one member of the staff Reich talked with at some length was the Protestantchaplain, Frederick Silber, who later became Chief Chaplain for the Federal Bureau ofPrisons. In 1972, 1 interviewed Reverend Silber after he had retired9.Silber saw Reich frequently, as the latter often sought him out. The chaplain’s officewas on a main pathway and the prisoners would go by it several times a day. The men coulddrop in freely.Silber did not know much about Reich’s concepts and the little he did know,he “didn’t buy.” However, he enjoyed his talks with him. Reich did not discuss his “sexualtheories,” and Silber indicated he would not have agreed with them anyway. Nor did Reichtalk much about orgone energy. He talked about human nature. Reich occasionally referredto a“conspiracy” against him, but did not belabor this theme. For Silber, it was no differentfrom what many prisoners said about being “railroaded” into jail. Except for the conspira-cy theme, Silber found Reich quite rational in their discussions.Reich was generally quiet and apart from others. “Not many people knew him orwhat his theories were. He obeyed the rules and went about his business quietly. He gotalong with the guards.” Silber does not remember Reich being openly angry, though at timeshis withdrawal and preoccupation could be interpreted as reflecting anger.Emotionally, Silber said, Reich was most preoccupied with Aurora Karrer and vis-iting and writing privileges, especially as they related to her. Reich and Karrer very muchwanted to marry, but this was not possible according to the prison rules of that time.Silber had not noted any signs ofphysical deterioration in Reich save for a “shuf-fling” when he walked down the corridor.At the end ofthe interview, I asked Silber if there was any final comment he wouldlike to make.He replied:32 : Prison and Death: 1957 437éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"“In retrospect what most impresses me was the loneliness of the man. And hisdependency on the young lady. He could be vibrant when he talked about her. We didn’tappreciate him sufficiently how much he needed us. Of course, all prisoners needed moreof us, there wasn’t enough time to go around. But it was harder for Reich than for manyothers who were used to prison as a way of life.” (Reich’s co-prisoners had also committedfederal crimes, ranging from income tax evasion to kidnapping, but unlike him, many wereserving long sentences or were repeat offenders.) Silber’s information bears on two cloudy points. According to Ilse Ollendorff,Reich’s letters from prison to Peter “showed a kind of religious fervor somewhat difficult tounderstand in the man who for so many decades of his life had fought very articulately anykind of organized religion. He spoke about the need for ‘Harbors for Life,’ ‘Churches forLife,’ ‘Sanctuaries for Life.’”10Reading the same letters, I find no evidence of any majordifference in Reich’s attitude toward religion in prison than before prison, nor any change inhis opposition to “organized religion.” Essentially, in his last months Reich repeated what hehad been saying for years that what was called “God” and what he had formulated as“orgone energy” were identical We should revere “God” or “orgone energy,” and allow ourlives to be governed by its laws. In the stress and bleakness of prison life, the prison chapeland religious metaphors no doubt had a special appeal for Reich. Silber did not discuss spe-cific theological issues with him. It seems clear that Reich was not planning any conversionto a religious creed.The second hazy point concerns Reich’s writings in prison. Various persons havecommented that in prison Reich was working on a book entitled Creation.This manuscriptwas never found after his death. Given Reich’s fear that his work might be stolen, one mustquestion how much he would commit to paper, especially mathematical equations. Duringthe prison period,as before, he said that valuable equations were “in his head,” to be sharedwith the world only after the FDA ceased persecuting him.Silber remembers Reich writing a good deal of the time. He showed the chaplainsome pages which Silber believed were more of an “unburdening himself of his thoughts,”especially about the legal situation, than a scientific manuscript. At that time, all Reich’s let-ters and any other writings had to go through the educational office.The Lewisburg prison files yield considerable evidence of Reich’s writings. In June1957,he was preparing an appeal for a presidential pardon; he had engaged a new lawyer,Roy St. Lewis, to help him with his legal efforts. (I believe he had heard about St. Lewisthrough Eva Reich.) On June 5, he wrote this lawyer stating that he was consideringrenouncing his U.S. citizenship if “crimes by the FDA were not fully undone.”In August, when the chairman of Silverfs parole board wrote Reich for informa-tion about Silvert, Reich replied: “I cannot speak for Dr. Silvert ... He has no connectionwith my basic position in functional logic and basic research. My case should be consideredentirely separate from his.” The board denied Silverfs application. (Earlier, Dr. Hubbard haddeclared Silvert legally sane, but under Reich’s spell, in a kind of “folie a deux.”11Hubbardrecommended that Silvert should be kept in a different institution.) Silvert was a difficultMyron SharafFury On Earth438éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"prisoner, strongly protesting, for example, the lack of conjugal rights at Danbury and JudgeSweeney’s reference to the “orgone business.” He was not released until December 12, 1957,after having served three quarters of his one-year sentence12.Nothing came of Reich’s presidential appeal, so he turned his energies to preparingfor the parole hearing. He wrote a document entitled “My Unlawful Imprisonment,” whichhe sent to various prison officials and to the parole board. This document maintained exact-ly the same principles he had enunciated prior to prison, and is entirely consistent with muchthat he had been saying throughout his career. However, his dominant tone was that of theintrepid discoverer who will not recant or limit himself to Galileo’s whisper: “The earth doesmove.” Thus, his 1957 eccentricities were basically no different from his errors of the late1920s. To concentrate on his minor errors, to laugh at them or to defend them is entirely tomiss the point and to demonstrate again the “little man’s” attitude toward greatness Reichso well described.A few key passages from this prison document show both Reich’s continuinggrandeur and his pettiness:I. Cosmic aspect of my discovery.I have “done wrong” to have disclosed to mankind the cosmic primordialmass-free energy which fills the universe. This energy rules all living processes andthe lawful behavior of celestial functions. It determines our emotions, our firstsense of orientation, judgment and balance. I have “done wrong” in having discov-ered and made accessible the basic force in nature which for millennia was called“God” in many tongues...The scope of the discovery of this primal cosmic energy is of course notmy fault. I was imprisoned because my work has given the impression that either Iwas a dangerous lunatic or a criminal faker to my foes; a genius and a founder of anew hope for this world to my friends. I am neither a lunatic nor a faker. My dis-covery obeys simple natural laws. It was anticipated by many scientists, philoso-phers and writers...These paragraphs show Reich proud but clear. The following quotation reveals thedelusional, childish Reich:My technological achievements in the global atmosphere have already beenadapted by special departments of the U.S. Air Force and were developed further.I have heretofore hesitated for reasons of planetary security to call upon thesefriends in the U.S. Government to clarify for the world and confirm my cosmicenergy research. ... I am certain my implicit trust in “my friends in the U.S.Government” will never be disappointed. Working as I am at the outer frontierstoward space they are doubtless in agreement with me that trust must be main-tained among free men or be restored where shaken by the enemies of mankind.32 : Prison and Death: 1957 439éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"Reich continued to maintain that there was a conspiracy to destroy him and thensteal his discoveries for commercial and political interests.Reich was eligible for parole on November 10, 1957, at which time he would haveserved a third of his sentence. In answer to questions in his parole application, Reich statedthat upon release he intended to spend the summers at Orgonon and winters in Washington.His wife (as he now referred to Aurora Karrer, although they were not legally married) waslooking for a home in the Washington area. He would earn money through teaching (at therate of $200 per two-hour course). In addition, he would receive $3,000 yearly from a fundadministered by William Steig for Reich’s work on the DOR emergency13. (To his final daysReich kept the distinction of charging a high fee for the dissemination of established knowl-edge and a low salary for himself for new research.) Reich made his position clear as to whether he would obey or disobey the injunc-tion after his release from prison. This issue was decisive since the FDA’s and the probationofficer’s construction of his position had determined to a significant degree Judge Sweeney’searlier refusal to suspend or reduce Reich’s sentence, as we have seen.Reich now made plain that he would not—he twice underlined the word in his appli-cation—rebuild the organizations which distributed the accumulators and which he had dis-solved. He steadfastly maintained that he, personally, had never distributed accumulators. Hemade the distinction here between a research activity and a moneymaking fraud with “sexboxes,” the latter being the FDA’s misrepresentation of what was going on. Since his incomewould be derived from teaching and research, since he would not rebuild his organization,he had no intention after his release of involving himself with the distribution of accumu-lators.Thus, Reich was prepared to obey the injunction’s legal sense, that is, to stop thedistribution of accumulators. However, as we know, the injunction contained much more:the defendants (Reich, Ollendorff, and the Foundation) were ordered to “refrain from, eitherdirectly or indirectly ...disseminating information pertaining to the assembly, construction,or composition oforgone energy accumulator devices.” And in another part of the injunc-tion, Reich was supposed to delete from his publications “statements and representationspertaining to the existence oforgone energy.”Reich made it clear that he would continue to teach and do research and that hissubject matter would deal with orgone energy. The reference to DOR research, financed inpart by Steig’s fund, was evidence of his courageous, unyielding devotion to truth-seeking.He did not say that he would only teach “philosophy” or “character analysis.” He did notsay he would not mention orgone energy. On the contrary, he continued proudly to assertthe scientific and moral Tightness of his stance. Reich went on: “I have no attitude ofrevenge, only pity—the hurt that hurts so very much. The heartbreak caused by raw injus-tice can never be erased, of course. The assailants have suffered their well-deserved moraldefeat.I have won my case.”Implicit in Reich’s stance was his inability to stop others from doing what theyMyron SharafFury On Earth440éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"wished. In Reich’s view, orgone energy and the orgone accumulator were nothing to beashamed of—on the contrary. Yet his parole statement made it clear that he would not act“in concert” with anyone or any organization distributing accumulators. Still, from his pridein his discovery, from his insistence that he would go on thinking and talking about anddoing research on orgone energy, one can understand, not condone, what Maguire, Mills,and the probation officer may well have earlier told the judge and now the parole board. Myown construction of then- thinking goes: “This tricky customer is unrepentant. He says heis going to teach and in the process he’ll talk about the worthless orgone energy. Then hisdoctors, for whom he is the big boss, will go ahead and rent the boxes and then give himthe money. He says he can get $100 an hour. Keep him in jail.”From the prison material, the deepest part of Reich emerged in extremely touch-ing letters to his son. On March 24, 1957, shortly after his arrival at Lewisburg, Reich wrotePeter:... I am in Lewisburg. I am calm, certain in my thoughts, and doing math-ematics most of the time. I am kind of “above things,” fully aware of what is up.Do not worry too much about me, though anything might happen. I know, Pete,that you are strong and decent.At first I thought you should not visit me here. I donot know. With the world in turmoil I now feel that a boy your age should experi-ence what is coming his way—fully digest it without getting a “belly ache,” so tospeak, nor getting off the right track of truth, fact, honesty, fair play, and beingabove board—never a sneak...Reich wrote this on his sixtieth birthday. We know how much he liked to note thedecades. He had parties a rare event for him on the occasion of his fortieth and fiftiethbirthdays. He had looked forward to publishing the documentary material on his life andwork by his sixtieth birthday. Now he was experiencing that birthday alone in jail.On several occasions Peter visited Reich in prison. One of Peter’s most hauntingmemories is ofReich waving from the distance as he walked down the prison corridor awayfrom the visitor’s room. He also recalls Reich’s telling him that when he was Peter’s age (thir-teen),he had lost his mother;his father was about to die from grief over his mother’s deathand he himselfwas about to move into the turmoil of war. Still, he had accomplished much.Even his jail sentence was, in a way, an honor since he was held on the basis of an uncon-stitutional court order.He also told Peter that he cried a good deal and he wanted Peter to let himself cryfully,too.So Reich, who for decades had said that “crying is the great softener,” was practic-ing the same faith to the end. It says a great deal for Reich’s integrity that, true to himself,his comments to Peter emphasize crying not in a self-pitying way, but in terms of its deepemotional value.Where Reich found the solitude within prison to cry “with sound,” as heused to say in therapy—for sound was important if the sobbing was to be healing—I do not32 : Prison and Death: 1957 441éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"know. Outside prison only a few very trusted people ever saw him cry.In one of Peter’s conversations with his father, he made a positive reference toJoseph McCarthy, linking McCarthy and his father because of their common anti-Communist zeal. Reich replied that Peter should not compare his fate with McCarthy’s.McCarthy had no solutions. But Reich had made a discovery with which to fight evil.Eva visited Reich while he was in prison. There was generally a good relationshipbetween the two, although at one point Reich became quite upset because Eva had report-ed to Aurora (who lived in Lewisburg during part of Reich’s confinement) some local gos-sip about them as a couple. Aurora in turn was annoyed and Reich angry at Eva for report-ing such gossip14.Eva believes that during his prison stay, Reich wanted to name Aurora Karrer asexecutrix of his estate rather than herself. The reasons for this were never made clear. In anycase, no will later than the one Reich had signed on March 8, 1957, before going to jail, wasever found.On October 22, 1957, in good spirits Reich wrote in his last letter to Peter that thedate of his possible release was November 10, with a parole hearing scheduled for a few daysbefore. Reich concluded by requesting his son to find a good hotel in Poughkeepsie to stayin on visits.He asked Peter to find a place without chlorinated water. And he agreed thatthey had a “date” for a meal at the Howard Johnson’s restaurant near Peter’s school.They were never able to keep it. Around October 22, Reich felt ill but he would notreveal it to the prison authorities for fear his sickness might delay the parole15. Undoubtedlyhis distrust of physicians was even higher within prison. He intended to recuperate in asanatarium after his release.To the end, Reich was hoping and planning for the future. But that part of him thathad believed he would die in prison prevailed. When he failed to appear for the roll call onNovember 3, the prison staff found him at 7:00 A.M. He had died in his sleep. His shoeswere off,but otherwise he was fully clothed and lying on top of the bed.Upon examination,a physician placed the time of death several hours earlier. Hisdeath was attributed to heart complications “myocardial insufficiency with sudden heart fail-ure associated with generalized arteriosclerosis and sclerosis of the coronary vessels.”16Sometime during the early morning of November 3, Reich’s vital spark, his orgone energy,could no longer bounce back.He had been pushed beyond the limits of his endurance. Hedied of heartbreak.Myron SharafFury On Earth442éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"Epilogue When Reich died, the future of his work was in peril. His books were banned, theaccumulator outlawed. Most of his students felt disheartened and were leaderless. Few hadthe training or the motivation to continue his scientific momentum.This bleak state of affairs was not reflected in Reich’s will. Looking into the future,he had envisioned royalties from his books and inventions, royalties sufficient to pay for theexpense of maintaining Orgonon. All of Orgonon, but particularly the Observatory, shouldconstitute the Wilhelm Reich Museum, which would preserve for visitors “some of theatmosphere in which the Discovery of Life Energy has taken place over the decades.”1Moreover, Reich envisioned that maintaining Orgonon would only require a smallpart of the royalty income. The bulk, he directed, should go to the Wilhelm Reich InfantTrust Fund,to be established for “the care of infants everywhere” but not specifically forresearch on infants and children. Reich added that part of the income could also be used forbasic orgonomic investigations. It is interesting that Reich gave such priority to the care ofinfants. Undoubtedly, this decision reflected his love of children. Yet his relegating basicorgonomic research to a secondary place reflects, in my view, his distrust of the capacity ofhis students to carry on such research and his difficulty envisioning such an enterprise with-out him.When Eva Reich assumed the trusteeship in late 1957, there were no royalties foranything. Moreover, she was depressed about her father’s death and uncertain about her ownlegitimacy as executrix. In prison Reich had expressed some distrust of her and seemedinclined to want Aurora Karrer to be the trustee. Although Eva made some efforts toinvolve Karrer in the trusteeship, the latter proved unable or unwilling to fulfill this func-tion. Eva continued to want someone else to assume the role. In 1959 she heard from Dr.Raphael about a former patient of his, Mary Higgins, who had never met Reich but who wasintensely interested in his work and, it turned out, in the trusteeship. After speaking withHiggins,Eva offered her the role. She accepted and since 1959 has fulfilled the responsibil-ities involved2.A woman ofindependent means, Higgins was able to devote herself fully to thetrusteeship and to make a loan to the trust fund to start bringing Orgonon, which had dete-riorated after Reich’s death, into better shape. In 1960, she arranged for publication ofReich’s books by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, the small but distinguished New York pub-lisher. As of this date (1982) some sixteen works have appeared, covering almost the fullscope ofhis investigations. They enjoy the kind of steady sale Reich always wished for hispublications.443éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"The injunction decree against Reich’s books applied only to Reich, the WilhelmReich Foundation, Use Ollendorff, Silvert, and persons “acting in concert” with them. TheFoundation was dissolved prior to Reich’s death. In May 1958, five months after his releasefrom prison, Silvert committed suicide. He was sick, his license to practice medicine hadbeen revoked, he was working as a bellhop captain3. I would speculate that guilt over hisrole in Reich’s last years may have been an additional motive for his action. In any case, by1959 all the defendants in the FDA case had passed from the scene.The Higgins trusteeship has not been without dissension. Her most controversialdecision concerns the accessibility to scholars of Reich’s unpublished papers. Higgins hasinterpreted Reich’s statement in his will that his papers should be “stored” for fifty yearsafter his death (i.e., until 2007) to mean that no one should see them except her. This inter-pretation has been legally opposed by Eva Reich, but so far the courts have upheld Higgins.I, too, disagree with Higgins’ interpretation and with another manifestation of herpossessive tendency towardReich’s work her reluctance to give permission to authors toquote extensively from Reich’s publications. A final disagreement is that I believe Reich’slater unavailable articles deserve publishing priority over early analytic papers that have beenreissued. Yet on balance I believe that she has done a good job as trustee. Of particular valuehas been her insistence on publishing Reich’s important books, regardless of the questionof their salability. Her orderly procedures are also manifest when one visits Orgonon; thesetting closely resembles that of Reich’s days.Following Reich’s death, Elsworth Baker continued the training of physicians inorgonomic therapy, a role he performed several years prior to Reich’s demise. Today thereare about twenty psychiatrists working with him. In 1967 the semi-annual Journal ofOrgonomy, which deals with all aspects of orgonomy, began appearing under Baker’s editor-ship. In 1968 Baker and his associates founded the College of Orgonomy as an umbrellaorganization for orgonomic research as well as educational activities. In 1981 the collegestarted a fund-raising campaign with a goal of $2 million to finance a building in Princeton,New Jersey,where all the functions of the college can be centralized. As of 1982 the cam-paign has raised $1 million,a far cry from the financial plight of orgonomy immediately afterReich’s death.Another activity related to the College has been a course on Reich’s work given byPaul Mathews and John Bell since 1968 through the Division of Continuing Study at NewYork University. It is the longest-running course in this particular Division. A differentapproach to a wider public was started by Lois Wyvell in 1980 when she published the firstissue of Offshoots of Orgonomy. The articles are written in clear popular language and areaddressed to the interested layman, The first three issues have included valuable material onchild upbringing and two outstanding studies of the use of orgone energy to stimulate plantgrowth4.It is true that Baker and his students have tended to devalue much of Reich’s earli-er sociological work whenever it conflicts or appears to conflict with his later, more conser-vative emphases. They have also angrily dismissed any contributions from Neo-ReichiansMyron SharafFury On Earth444éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":446,"pageContent":"and others. However, the cause of orgonomy has been handsomely served by Baker and thecollege. They have kept Reich’s central concepts clearly in focus and have developed manyof them. Some orgonomists have done important original research which expands Reich’sideas.Reich’s impact on the professional and intellectual community beyond his closeadherents can be clearly seen in a number of fields. The growth of psychoanalytic ego psy-chology since the 1950s owes much to Character Analysis. Reich’s advice to proceed alwaysfrom the most superficial layer of the personality and to penetrate gradually to the uncon-scious, his urgings not to overlook a latent negative transference that is masked by a super-ficial positive transference—these and other aspects of his early contributions are an inte-gral part of the present-day theory of analytically oriented treatment.Reich’s later work on the muscular armor has been developed by two Neo-Reichians in particular—Alexander Lowen and John Pierrakos. Both studied with Reichbefore collaboration, under Lowen’s leadership in the late 1950s, in the development of“bio-energetics,” or their amplifications of Reichian techniques. Pierrakos later made inde-pendent modifications and started his own school of “core-energetics.” They have bothmade many pioneering contributions, for example, Lowen’s use of the standing position(“grounding”) in therapy, self-help techniques, and Pierrakos’ development of a communi-ty setting to facilitate the liberation of the “core” self. Unlike the Baker group, however,Lowen and Pierrakos have altered Reich’s therapeutic paradigm by de-emphasizing the con-cept of orgastic potency and omitting the connections between Reich’s therapy and his stud-ies of orgone energy.Other popular, body-oriented approaches such as primal therapy and Gestalt ther-apy borrow considerably from Reich with little acknowledgment of his contribution. Wehave, then, the phenomenon of Reich’s therapeutic work spreading ever more widely but inhighly diluted forms and with its source unacknowledged.The particular conceptual thrust of Reich’s research on infants and children has notentered the social scene. Yet some aspects of his emphases can be found in many medicaland educational developments we see today:the Leboyer method of delivery, the growingopposition to circumcision,the stress on mother-infant “bonding,” and increased affirma-tion ofchildhood and adolescent genitality.There remains a profound silence about Reich’s experimental work, broken everynow and then by a call for serious appraisal of scientific orgonomy. Thus, Philip Rieff wrotein 1960:“Competent scientific opinion has yet seriously to confront [Reich’s] work... . Thebrilliance of his vision is such that he can no longer be dismissed as a figure of fun... .Leaving Freud at the edge ofthe last desert, littered, as [Reich] saw it, with dying gods andmurder machines, Reich stepped across, as few men do, into the very heaven of an idea.”5In a review ofThe Mass Psychology of Fascism, the critic Christopher Lehmann-Hauptwrote in The New York Timesfor January 4, 1971: “Perhaps it is time to reconsider all ofWilhelm Reich...and to reopen the question of cosmic orgone energy, its effect on cancer,and the other theories Reich died in Lewisburg Penitentiary defending.”6Epilogue 445éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"In an address given at the Boston Museum of Science in May 1977, William Tiller,chairman of the Department of Material Physics at Stanford University, argued for the exis-tence of an as yet unknown energy, which he asserted “may be the same as, for example,what Reich called orgone.”7However, a few swallows do not a summer make. The weight of scientific opinionstill considers Reich’s experimental work unworthy of serious investigation. The FDA stillcites the banning of the accumulator as one of the prize feathers in its enforcement cap.Persons studying or working in academic institutions who do orgonomic research on theirown often feel they must use a pseudonym when they publish their findings in the Journal ofOrgonomy; they fear their interest in Reich will be held against them by their superiors.Needless to say, such an atmosphere has a chilling effect on orgonomic inquiry. It also servesas a self-fulfilling prophecy, for a long-held argument against the validity of orgonomy is thatso little research has been conducted since Reich’s death twenty-five years ago.Many of the people who knew Reich well and who have figured prominently inthese pages are now dead; for example, Ottilie Reich Heifetz, Annie Reich, Grete Bibring,Lia Laszky, Otto Fenichel, Berta Bornstein, A. S. Neill, Ola Raknes, Theodore Wolfe, andWalter Hoppe. Some, like Arthur Koestler, are still alive but have never, to my knowledge,been closely interviewed about their relationship with and opinion of Reich. Many of thesepersons are quite aged and an important part of history may slip past us unless their recol-lections are soon recorded.Others who were significant moved on to nonorgonomic undertakings. IlseOllendorff taught high-school French and German until her retirement in the late 1970s.Peter Reich works as a public health professional, influenced by but by no means highlycommitted to his father’s investigations. (Of the family members, only Eva Reich activelyworks in orgonomy, reaching a large number of people through her worldwide lectures andworkshops.) Dr. James Willie and Dr. A. Allan Cott (who worked closely with Reich in thelate 1940s) have left the field of orgonomy entirely. Dr. Cott is now prominent in nutrition-al therapy.This biography began by raising such questions as how Reich became what he wasand how much of what he did was true. Although I may not have answered these questionsfully,my work will hopefully serve as one of the beginnings. In pursuing Reich and his work,I have tried to keep in mind George Steiner’s words quoted in the Introduction: “The innerlives ofShakespeare and Michelangelo are our heritage; we feed our smaller sensibilities ontheir donations and excess. There can be no other thanks than extreme precision, than thepatient, provisional, always inadequate attempt to get each case right, to map its command-ing wealth.”Let me conclude by repeating Reich’s conviction, and my own, that the main prob-lem in evaluating Reich’s work and person lies not with him but with ourselves—above all,in our tendency to “run” from what he studied.Myron SharafFury On Earth446éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"NOTES It would require a separate volume to give a full history of the various editions of Reich’spublications. Suffice it here to say that it is extremely difficult to obtain many of his workswith their original content. Reich was himself partly responsible for this deplorable state of affairs. Although he sometimes insisted on Englishtranslations of earlier German publications or manuscripts that adhered to the original text,he would on other occasions make changes without clarifying what the alterations were.Mary Higgins and Chester M. Raphael are serving as editors for what appears to be a stan-dard edition of all of Reich’s writings, published through Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. In myview, it is fortunate that they did not follow Reich’s wish to change the term “dialectical mate-rialism”to “energetic functionalism” when they supervised the preparation of The BionExperiments (1979) from the German monograph Die Bione (1938). It is unfortunate thattheir English edition (1981) ofDie Funktion des Orgasmus (1927) adheres to Reich’s emen-dations, made in the 19405, without explaining how the original text was changed. Nor canone obtain the original publications: they are out of print and very few libraries have them.We sorely need an accurate and available record of the development of Reich’s thought andwork.However, these textual problems are a small matter compared to the fact that many of Reich’slate publications went “out of print” when unsold copies were burned by the Food and DrugAdministration in the 19508. The holder of the copyright, Mary Higgins, can now reissuethem,but she and the publisher have apparently decided to publish earlier works first. In theinterim we are deprived of some of Reich’s most important contributions, especially a num-ber of articles on his method of thought (“orgonomic functionalism”), on Oranur and itsaftermath, and on infants and children. These and other articles are unavailable save formicrofilm copies that were generously donated by Eva Reich to some libraries in this coun-try and abroad.In citing Reich’s publications, I have used the translations by Theodore P. Wolfe, althoughonly one of these is in print. I do so because their literary verve is superior to the translationsdone for the available Higgins edition. Moreover, Wolfe’s work had the benefit of Reich’scareful review.In my citations of Wolfe’s translations, I have used chapter rather than pagereferences so that the interested reader may more readily find them in the available edition.Abbreviations Interviews AI: Author’s Interview AC:Author’s Conversation Tel.Int.:Telephone Interview 447éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Names WR: Wilhelm Reich ER: Eva Reich IOR: Ilse Ollendorff Reich EL: Elsa Lindenberg LL: Lia Laszky OH: Ottilie Heifetz Publications JO: Journal of Orgonomy JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association IZP: Internationale Zeitschrift fur Psychoanalyse ZPS: Zeitschrift fur Politische Psychologie und Sexualokonomie OEB: Orgone Energy Bulletin IJSO: International Journal of Sex-Economy and Orgone-Research FO: The Function of the Orgasm SR: The Sexual Revolution MPF: The Mass Psychology of Fascism CB:The Cancer Biopathy PIT: People in Trouble RSF:Reich Speaks of Freud CHAR.

Elsa Lindenberg and UseOllendorffboth recount that Reich told the father of the affair, but do not mention thefather’s “forcing” the truth from anyone.14. Interview with OH, Aug. 21, 1971. 1 would stress again that we do not know the timeMyron SharafFury On Earth450éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"interval between the father’s detection of the affair and the mother’s suicide. In his “case his-tory,” Reich appears to make himself about a year younger than he was when he discoveredthe liaison, for we now know with some certainty that Reich was thirteen at the time of hismother’s suicide. This is the age given by Beverly R. Placzek, the editor of the Reich-Neillcorrespondence (New York:FSG, 1981). Since Mary Higgins, the executrix of the Reichestate, cooperated with this venture and searched out “relevant material” for the editor, wecan assume that Ms. Higgins drew on Reich’s personal papers to authenticate his age.In describing himself as around eleven and a half or twelve at the time of the affair, Reichmay well have been making himself over a year younger than he actually was. He also dateshis first sexual intercourse as taking place earlier than it did. However, again I must cautionthat we do not know the length of the interval between the father’s awareness of the affairand the mother’s suicide. I have lingered on these details because of the overwhelming sig-nificance Reich attaches as I do to this childhood tragedy for his later work and develop-ment.15. AI with OH, Aug. 21, 1971.16.

However, some of her ambivalence about Reich and his work was reflected in herdesire for me to use her maiden name when referring to her in this book rather than hermarried name, which she employed professionally as an analyst. Her wish for some anonymity was further revealed when I asked her if I had spelled her maiden name correct-ly. She said I had it slightly wrong but she preferred it that way.16. In my July 15 interview with LL, she told me that she and Reich had had an affair dur-ing their medical school days and that he had been a clumsy lover. When I wrote a first draftof this chapter, which included the story of their relationship, I sent it to her. On furtherreflection, she gave me by telephone the revised version of their relationship included here.17.AI with Grete Bibring,May 30,1971,and LL,Aug. 2, 1971.

AC with WR, Summer 1948.9.I am considerably indebted to Douglas Levinson, psychiatrist and researcher in electro-physiology, for his help with technical aspects of this chapter and its rewriting.10. Some readers may appreciate a review of the basic concepts in this area. Electric cur-rents consist of electrons flowing along any available conductive path from an area of morenegative charge to an area of less negative charge. The “pressure” for electron flow is theamount of the difference in charge between the two areas, measured as voltage. For anyamount ofvoltage, the actual current flow in a given time depends on the conducting path-way’s resistance to current flow (measured in ohms, while current is measured in amperes).If a gradient exists between two areas, one can speak of a potential voltage, even if there isno conductive pathway and thus no flow of current.In electrodermal research, skin resistance can be measured by passing a controlled, imper-ceptible current through the skin via two electrodes placed a short distance apart. Anychange in the current from moment to moment can then be attributed to variation in theskin resistance. Early researchers found that stimuli, particularly frightening or surprisingones, produced discrete, brief (seconds) wavelike reductions in skin resistance, known as the“psychogalvanic response” or “galvanic skin response,” or today simply as the “skin resist-ance response”or its inverse,“skin conductance response.”It was also found that even without externally applied current, the skin would often gener-ate a small current between two electrodes placed on the skin because of unequal charge,i.e.,a skin potential. While skin resistance responses are unidirectional, toward lower resist-ance,skin potential can show either brief(wavelike) or prolonged changes because of thedemonstration of spontaneous change in the skin and the two opposite directions ofchange.11.For a fuller account of WR’s concepts as well as his experimental results, cf.

Reich was inclined to blame others when a contact endedbadly.I remember around 1950 Reich conceived the idea of donating some of his books tothe Rangeley Public Library. He asked me what I thought of the plan. In the face of hisenthusiasm I was not inclined to express my doubts about the degree to which the librarianwould welcome the gift ofThe Function of the Orgasm. Later, when she returned thebooks as unacceptable, a very hurt Reich fiercely blamed me for proposing the idea of send-ing the books.27.This letter ofMarch 17, 1937, was translated by the author.28.

Einstein was engaged in planning for the development of the atomic bomb. It isquite possible, but by no means verifiable at this time, that the FBI warned Einstein againstfurther contact with Reich.

How I came upon the FDA file back in the 19605 and prior to theFreedom of Information Act that makes it available to the public says something about theFDA’s view of the case. At the time, Nathan C. Hale was planning a study of Reich. He knewthe FDA had refused to permit indignant followers of Reich to see the material. Hence hepresented himself quite differently, simply asking to see their “six most famous cases” forpurposes of an article he was writing, with the correct conviction that they would so definethe Reich affair. He was also permitted to Xerox the records on the “six most famous cases,”including the material on Reich. When Hale gave up the idea of doing the study, he gener-ously permitted me to use the material.7. Jerome Greenfield,Wilhelm Reich Vs. the U.S.A.(New York: W. W. Norton, 1974), 61-62.8. Ibid., 62.9.

I have listed several, with an asterisk, which are not available: they were burned by the Food and Drug Administration. Ibriefly describe them here to encourage public pressure for their reissue. Unless otherwise indicated, all the books were edited by Mary Higgins and Chester M. Raphael; theywere published by Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux of New York City. The first date given refers to the Farrar publication, the second to the earliest publication of the work in whole or in part.Early Writings, Vol. I, 1975, 1920s. This collection contains two papers of special interest:Reich’s monograph on the impulsive character and his disguised autobiographical account,“The Pubertal Breaching of the Incest Taboo”, which I have used as a main key to under-standing Reich.Genitality, 1981, 1927. This book is, essentially, a translation of Reich’s German study,DieFunktion des Orgasmus(not to be confused with the almost totally different later English vol-ume with the same title). It is of great historical importance because it contains Reich’s firstdetailed description oforgastic potency. However, its most important findings are present-ed more succintly in the later English volume.The Invasion of Compulsory Morality, 1974, 1932. This represents Reich’s attempt to understandthe origin ofsick attitudes toward sexuality through the use of findings by Malinowski, theMarxist tradition, and his own investigations. It is less clearly written than many of his otherbooks.The Mass Psychology of Fascism, 1969, 1933. This classic work on the relationship between per-sonality and receptivity to fascism antedates and strikes more deeply than the later, better-known work ofErich Fromm and the authors of The Authoritarian Personality.Character Analysis, 1972, 1933. This book surveys Reich’s psychiatric work from the 1920sthrough the 19405.Although the first sections are considered classic contributions to psy-choanalytic theory and technique,the last parts dealing with the muscular armor and bio-energetic streamings have been shockingly neglected.The Sexual Revolution,1974,1936.This book still represents the most slashing critique of tra-ditional sexuality and the clearest affirmation of the healthy genital impulses of children,adolescents, and adults.The Biological Foundations ofPleasure and Anxiety,1982,1937.This work describes a key tran-sition in Reich’s development,his first laboratory studies. It also contains two fine papersthat show the theoretical path to these experiments.Myron SharafFury On Earth490éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":492,"pageContent":"The Bion Experiments, 1979, 1938. Although the findings of this book are more conciselysummarized in The Cancer Biopathy, the first work contains more experimental detail.The Cancer Biopathy, 1973, 1948. This work is a marvel of concise, clear presentation ofReich’s laboratory work from 1938 to the mid-i94os. It shows the path to the discovery oforgone energy and also depicts Reich’s many-sided approach to the etiology, treatment, andprevention of cancer.Ether, God, and Deviland Cosmic Superimposition, 1972, 1950 and 1951. The first work in thistwo-book volume gives the most complete picture available of Reich’s functional method ofthought. It is as important as it is neglected, even by students of orgonomy. The secondwork is less accessible to the layman save for the last and important chapter on “the rootingof reason in nature.”Listen, Little Man!, 1975, 1948. This is a forceful, vivid critique of the armor of the averageperson, written in a way that is accessible to anyone willing to bear the discomfort of itstruths, which are often stated belligerently.People in Trouble, 1976, 1953. This book contains Reich’s most personal, vivid account of hisparticipation in the Marxist movement during the late 1920s and early 1930s.The Murder of Christ, 1979, 1953. In simple, blazing prose, Reich relates the attacks on Christto those on other pioneers, including himself.Reich Speaks ofFreud,1967.This is Reich’s most vivid statement of the relationship betweenhis work and himself to psychoanalysis and Freud.Record of a Friendship: The Correspondence between Wilhelm Reich and A. S. Neill, 1982 (Ed. byBeverly R. Placzeck). NeilFs light touch and varied interests stand in sharp contrast toReich’s inexorable scientific march. Withal, a fascinating exchange.Wilhelm Reich,Sexpol Essays, 1929-1934 (Ed. by Lee Baxandall, New York: Random House,1972). This is the only available collection of some of Reich’s sex-political papers that werewritten during his Marxist phase. The book is well translated and a superb contribution.Reich, “Biophysical Functionalism and Mechanistic Natural Science,”JO, 8, 1974, 4-18. Thisis one of Reich’s most profound theoretical statements. Reich, “Character and Society,”JO,8,1974,116-129. This contains one of Reich’s finest sociopsychological papers, written withmasterful clarity.* Reich’s unavailable articles on his method of thought: Orgonomic Functionalism.OrgoneEnergy Bulletin,II,1950,1-16;49-62; 99-123.OEB,IV,1952,1-12; 186-196. In these papersReich presents his work from the viewpoint of his method of thought. These are sharp, pro-foundly original, and badly needed today.* Reich’s unavailable articles on children: “Children of the Future: I,”OEB,II,1950,194-206.“Armoring in a Newborn Infant,”OEB,III,1951,121-138.BIBLIOGRAPHIE491éditionsles atomes de l’âme"},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"*Reich’s unavailable articles on Oranur and its aftermath: “The Oranur Experiment,”EOB,III, 1951, 267-344; “DOR Removal and Cloud-Busting,”OEB, IV, 1952, 171-182; “CROPDesert: Space Ships, DOR, and Drought,” CORE, VI, 1954, 1-149.BOOKS ABOUT REICH Baker, Elsworth F.,Man in the Trap, New York: Avon Books, 1967.

This is a fine study of the totality of Reich’s work.Cattier, Michael,The Life and Work of Wilhelm Reich, New York: Avon Books, 1971. Cattierdeals accurately with Reich’s work until about the year 1935, but dismisses it after that.Greenfield,Jerome,Wilhelm Reich Vs. the U.S.A.,New York: W. W. Norton, 1974. This fine-ly researched work studies the investigation of the Food and Drug Administration that ulti-mately led to the destruction of Reich’s accumulators and the burning of his books.Mann, W.

This slim poeticbook about children contains an absolutely first-rate bibliography of orgonomic literatureon infants and children.Raknes, Ola,Wilhelm Reich and Orgonomy, New York: Penguin Books, 1970.
