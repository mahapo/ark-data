It was not initially intended for publication. Thus, I had no hesitation in expressing what I might otherwise have left out owing to material considerations, good reputation in the general sense of the word, and some still unresolved trains of thought. To most people, it is a riddle that I can be active simul­taneously in disciplines as different as depth psychology, sociology, physiology, and now even biology. Some psycho­analysts wish that I would return to psychoanalysis; the soci­ologists relegate me to natural science and the biologists to psychology. The subject of \"sexuality\" virtually cuts through all scien­tific fields of research. In the central phenomenon, the sexual orgasm, we meet with questions deriving from the field of psychology as well as from that of physiology, from the field of biology no less than from that of sociology. Natural sci­ence offers hardly another field of research that is so well equipped to exhibit the fundamental unity of everything that lives and to guard against narrow, fragmentizing specializa­tion. Sex-economy became an independent discipline, having its own methods of research and its own body of knowledge.

Now it has become essential to describe its develop­ment. In doing so, I am very happy to be able to take the opportunity to clear up what I can claim as my own contribu­tion, how my work is related to other fields of research, and what is concealed behind the hollow rumors about my activ­ity. Sex-economy grew in the womb of Freud's psychoanalysis between 1919 and 1923. The material separation from this matrix took place around 1928, but it was not until 1934 that it was severed from the International Psychoanalytic Association. The present volume is more a relation of facts and events than it is a textbook. A systematic presentation of the ma­terial could not have shown the reader how, in the course of these twenty years, problems and solutions followed one upon the other. Nothing could have been contrived; every­thing owes its existence to the remarkable course of scientific logic. It is not false modesty when I say that I feel myself to be merely the instrument of this logic. The functional method of research acts like a compass in an unfamiliar region. I do not know of any finer proof of the validity of the sex-economic theory than the circumstance that the \"orgastic potency\" discovered in 1922, the most important element of sex-economy, led to and found its natural-scientific substantiation in the discovery of the or­gasm reflex (1935) and orgone radiation (1939). This inherent logic in the development of sex-economy is its ful. crum in a welter of opinions. It is its citadel in the struggle against misunderstandings and in the overcoming of grave doubts at a time when confusion threatens to stifle clear thinking. There are certain advantages in writing scientific biogra­phies in one's younger years. Some of the illusions one still has during that period, namely that people will be prepared to accept revolutionary insights, enable one to stick to the • / ..

The temptation to deny the sexual etiol­ogy of so many illnesses is far greater in the case of sex­economy than it was in psychoanalysis. It was only with great effort that I succeeded in establishing the term \"sex­economy.\" This concept is intended to cover a new scientific field: the investigation of biopsychic energy. According to the prevailing view of life, \"sexuality\" is an offensive term. It is very tempting to wipe out its importance for human life altogether. It will no doubt require the work of many gen­erations before sexuality is taken seriously by official science and the laity, probably not until the social questions of life and death bear in upon us the absolute necessity of compre­hending and mastering the sexual process, free of social con­straints. One such question is cancer; another is the psychic plague which gave rise to dictatorships. Sex-economy is a natural-scientific discipline. It is not ashamed of the subject of sexuality, and it rejects as its rep­resentative everyone who has not overcome the inculcated social fear of sexual defamation. The term \"vegetotherapy,\" used to describe the sex-economic therapeutic technique, is actually a concession to the squeamishness of the world in sexual matters. \"Orgasmotherapy\" would have been a much better, indeed more correct term, for this medical technique: that is precisely what vegetotherapy basically is. It had to be taken into consideration, however, that this term would have entailed too great a strain on the young sex-economists in their practice. Well, it can't be helped. Speak of the core of their natural longings and religious feelings and people will either laugh derisively or snicker sordidly.

One group will claim that the sexual function is sub­ordinate to the general functions of life, and hence of no real account. The other group of sex-economists will raise a strong, radical protest and attempt to save the honor of research on sexuality. In this controversy, the fundamental identity between sexual process and life process could become totally obscured. I, too, could give in and deny what was an honest scientific conviction in my younger years of struggle. For there is no reason to suppose that the fascist world will cease to threaten our difficult work with annihilation through moralistic, hereditary-oriented psychiatrists and party bu­reaucrats, as it has done and continues to do. Those friends who are familiar with the Norwegian scandal created by the fascist press campaign against sex-economy know what I mean. Without delay, therefore, it is imperative to establish what is meant by sex-economy, before I myself begin to think otherwise under the pressure of obsolete social conditions and obstruct with my authority the search for truth of future young scientists. The theory of sex-economy and its investigation of living phenomena can be stated in a few sentences. Psychic health depends upon orgastic potency, i.e., upon the degree to which one can surrender to and experience the climax of excitation in the natural sexual act. It is founded upon the healthy character attitude of the individual's capac­ity for love. Psychic illnesses are the result of a disturbance of the natural ability to love. In the case of orgastic impo­tence, from which the overwhelming majority of people suffer, damming-up of biological energy occurs and becomes the source of irrational actions. The essential requirement to cure psychic disturbances is the re-establishment of the natu­ral capacity for love. It is dependent upon social as well as psychic conditions. Psychic illnesses are the consequences of the sexual chaos of society.

It has served to bring about the psychic anchor­ing of a mechanized and authoritarian civilization by making man incapable of functioning independently. The vital energies regulate themselves naturally, without compulsive duty or compulsive morality-both of which are sure signs of existing antisocial impulses. Antisocial actions are the expression of secondary drives. These drives are produced by the suppression of natural life, and they are at variance with natural sexuality. People who are brought up with a negative attitude to­ward life and sex acquire a pleasure anxiety, which is physio­logically anchored in chronic muscular spasms. This neurotic pleasure anxiety is the basis on which life-negating, dictator­producing views' of life are reproduced by the people them­selves. It is the core of the fear of an independent, freedom­oriented way of life. This fear becomes the most significant source of strength for every form of political reaction, and for the domination of the majority of working men and women by individual persons or groups. It is a biophysiolog­ical fear, and it constitutes the central problem of the psy­chosomatic field of investigation. It has been until now the greatest obstruction to the investigation of the involuntary functions of life, which the neurotic person can experience only in a mysterious and fear-ridden way. The character structure of modern man, who reproduces a six-thousand-year-old patriarchal authoritarian culture, is typified by characterological armoring against his inner na­ture and against the social misery which surrounds him. This characterological armoring is the basis of isolation, in­digence, craving for authority, fear of responsibility, mystic longing, sexual misery, and neurotically impotent rebellious­ness, as well as pathological tolerance.

It is not found in the stages of human history prior to the de­velopment of patriarchy. Since the emergence of patriarchy, the natural pleasure of work and activity has been replaced by compulsive duty. The average structure of masses of people has been transformed into a distorted structure marked by impotence and fear of life. This distorted structure not only forms the psychologi­cal basis of authoritarian dictatorship, it enables these dicta­torships to justify themselves by pointing to human attitudes such as irresponsibility and childishness. The international catastrophe through which we are living is the ultimate con­sequence of this alienation from life. The structuring of masses of people to be blindly obedient to authority is brought about not by natural parental love, but by the authoritarian family. The suppression of the sex­uality of small children and adolescents is the chief means of producing this obedience. Nature and culture, instinct and morality, sexuality and achievement become incompatible as a result of the split in the human structure. The unity and congruity of culture and nature, work and love, morality and sexuality, longed for from time immemorial, will remain a dream as long as man continues to condemn the biological demand for natural (or­gastic) sexual gratification. Genuine democracy and freedom founded on consciousness and responsibility are also doomed to remain an illusion until this demand is fulfilled. Helpless subjugation to chaotic social conditions will continue to typify human existence. The destruction of life by means of coercive education and war will prevail. In the field of psychotherapy, I worked out the technique of character-analytic vegetotherapy. Its basic principle is the re-establishment of biopsychic motility through the dissolu­tion of the character and muscular rigidifications (\"armor­ings\").

Sexuality and anxiety are functions of the living organism operating in opposite directions: pleasurable expansion and anxious contraction. The orgasm formula which directs sex-economic research is as follows: MECHANICAL TENSION -+ BIOELECTRIC CHARGE -+ BIOELECTRIC DISCHARGE -+ MECHANICAL RELAXATION. It proved to be the formula of living functioning as such. It led to the experimental investigation of the organization of liv­ing from non-living matter, to experimental bion research, and, more recently, to the discovery of orgone radiation. Re­search in the field of sexuality and bions opened a new ap­proach to the problem of cancer and a number of other dis­turbances of vegetative life. The immediate cause of many devastating diseases can be traced to the fact that man is the sole species which does not fulfill the natural law of sexuality. The death of millions of people in war is the result of the overt, social negation of life. This negation, in turn, is the expression and consequence of psychic and somatic disturbances of the life function. The sexual process, i.e., the expansive process of biologi­cal pleasure, is the productive life process per se. This is saying a lot all at once, and it sounds almost too simple. This \"simplicity\" constitutes the secret which some people sense in my work. I want to try to describe how the difficulties were solved which have blocked human insight into these problems until now. I very much hope to persuade the reader that there was no magic involved. On the con­trary, my theory is general but unadmitted human knowl­edge about the functioning of life. It is to be ascribed to the universal alienation from life that the facts and relationships which I discovered have been overlooked or consistently con­cealed.

They will understand why, in the scope of the present volume, I have to refrain from paying due respect to their accomplishments. I can assure everyone who fought and often suffered for sex-economy that, without their ef­forts, the entire development would not have been possible. This presentation of sex-economy proceeds exclusively from the perspective of the European conditions which led to catastrophe. The victory of the dictatorships is ascribable to the psychic illness of the European masses who were not capable of mastering any of the various forms of democracy, economically, socially, or psychologically. I have not been in the United States long enough to judge to what extent my presentation does or does not apply to American conditions. The conditions which I have in mind are not solely external human relationships and social circumstances; what I have in mind is the deep psychic structure of American men and women and their society. It requires time to gain an under­standing of this structure. I can foresee that the English-language edition of this book will be objected to on various grounds. The many years of experience I had in Europe enabled me to use certain indi­cations to assess the importance of an attack, a critique, or an expression of praise. Since there is no reason to assume that the reactions of certain circles in this country will be fundamentally different from those of certain circles in Eu­rope, I should like to answer possible objections in advance. Sex-economy has nothing to do with anyone of the exist­ing political organizations or ideologies. The political con­cepts which separate the various strata and classes of society are not applicable to sex-economy. The social distortion of natural sexuality and its suppression in children and adoles­cents are universal human conditions, transcending all state and group boundaries.

On the other hand, they have met with recognition and respect in al1 strata and circles of the population. The elucidation of the function of the orgasm, particularly, was well received by professional-scientific and cultural-political groups of all kinds. Sexual suppression, biological rigidity, moralism, and as­ceticism are not confined to certain classes or strata of the population. They are found everywhere. I know of clergymen who willingly accept the distinction between natural and un­natural sexuality, and who acknowledge the scientific view that there is a parallel between the concept of God and the law of nature; I know of other clergymen who look upon the elucidation and concrete realization of child and adolescent sexuality as a threat to the existence of the Church and hence take strong measures to combat it. Praise and hatred quoted the same ideology in thei r defense. Liberalism and democ­racy felt as threatened as the dictatorship of the proletariat, the honor of socialism as much as the honor of the German woman. In reality, only one attitude and only one kind of social and moral arrangement is threatened by the elucida­tion of the function of life, namely the authoritarian dicta­torial regime of every kind which seeks through compulsive morality and compulsive work to destroy the spontaneous decency and natural self-regulation of the vital energies. However-and let us put the matter straight this time-it is not solely in totalitarian states that we find authoritarian dictatorship. It is found in the Church as well as in aca­demic organizations, among the communists as well as in parliamentary governments.

Its basic elements arc mystification of the life process, concrete helplessness of a material and social na­ture, fear of assuming the responsibility for determining one's own life, and, therefore, craving for illusionary secu­rity and authority, whether actively or passively. The genu­ine, age-old striving for the democratization of social life is based on self-determination, on natural sociality and moral. ity, on pleasurable work and on earthly happiness in love. It regardc every illusion as a danger. Hence, it will not only not fear the natural-scientific comprehension of life, it will make use of it to master decisive problems of the development of human structure in a scientific and practical and not in an illusionary way. Efforts are being made everywhere to trans­form formal democracy into a genuine democracy of all working men and women, into a work democracy, in keeping with the natural organization of the work process. In the field of mental hygiene, the first and foremost task is to replace sexual chaos, prostitution, pornographic litera­ture, and sexual trafficking, with natural happiness in love secured by society. This implies neither the intent \"to de­stroy the family\" nor \"to undermine morality.\" Family and morality are already undermined by the compulsive family and compulsive morality. Professionally, we are faced with the task of mastering the infirmities, in the form of psychic illnesses, caused by sexual and familial chaos. To master the psychic plague, it is necessary to draw a clear-cut distinction between the natural love which exists between parents and children and every form of familial compulsion. The en­demic illness, \"familitis,\" destroys everything which honest human strivings are attempting to achieve.

The social organization of man has the natural func­~ tion of protecting work and the natural fulfillment of love. From ancient times, these two biological activities of man ha ve been dependent upon scientific research and thought. Knowledge, work, and natural love are the sources of our life. They should also govern it, and the full responsibility should be borne by working men and women everywhere. Mental hygiene on a mass scale requires the power of knowledge against the power of ignorance; the power of vitally necessary work against every form of parasitism, whether of an economic, intellectual, or philosophic nature. Taking itself seriously, natural science can become a citadel against those forces which destroy life, no matter who per­petuates this destruction or where. Quite obviously, there is no one person who possesses the knowledge necessary to safeguard the natural function of life. The scientifically ra­tional view of life excludes dictatorship and demands work democracy. Social power, exercised by the people, through the people, and for the people, borne by the natural feeling for life and respect for the performance of work, would be invincible. However, this power presupposes that the working masses of people will become psychically independent and capable of bearing full responsibility for social existence and of ration­ally determining their own lives. What prevents this from happening is the psychic mass neurosis which is ma terialized in all forms of dictatorship and in all forms of political hullabaloo.

This social framework can only be genuine democracy. However, genuine democracy is not a condition of \"free­dom\" which can be given, granted, or guaranteed to a group of people by an elected or totalitarian government. Genuine democracy is a difficult, lengthy process in which the people, socially and legally protected, have (i.e., do not \"receive\") every possibility of schooling themselves in the administra­tion of vital individual and social life and of advancing to ever better forms of living. In short, genuine democracy is not a finished development which, like some old man, now enjoys its glorious, militant past. It is, rather, a process of unceasing wrestling with the problems of the unbroken devel­opment of new ideas, new discoveries, and new forms of liv­ing. The development will be continuous and incapable of be­ing disrupted only when the antiquated and senescent, which fulfilled its role at an earlier stage of democratic develop­ment, becomes sagacious enough to make room for the young and the new and does not stifle them by appealing to dignity or formal authority. Tradition is important. It is democratic when it fulfills its natural function of providing the new generation with a knowledge of the good and bad experiences of the past, i.e., of enabling it to learn from old errors and not repeat them. Tradition becomes the bane of democracy when it denies the rising generation the possibility of choice, when it at­tempts to dictate what is to be regarded as \"good\" and what as \"bad\" under new conditions of life. Traditionalists easily and readily forget that they have lost the ability to decide what is not tradition. For instance, the imp~ovement of the microscope was not brought about by destroying the first model: the improvement was achieved by preserving and developing the first model in keeping with a more ad­vanced stage of human knowledge.

Now suppose the Pasteur microscope had the power and the impudence to prohibit the electron microscope. The young would not feel any hostility toward tradition, would indeed have nothing but respect for it if, without jeopardizing themselves, they could say, UThis we will take over from you because it is strong, honest, still relative to our times and capable of development. That, however, we cannot take over. It was useful and true for your time-it would be useless to us.\" These young people will have to be prepared to hear the same thing from their children. The development of prewar democracy into complete and genuine work democracy means that the general public must acquire concrete determination of its existence in place of the formal, fragmentary, and defective sort of determination it has at present. It means that the irrational political molding of the will of the people has to be replaced by rational mas­tery of the social process. This requires the progressive self­education of the people toward responsible freedom, instead of the childish expectation that freedom can be received as a gift or can be guaranteed by someone else. If democracy wants to eradicate the tendency to dictatorship in the masses of the people, it will have to prove that it is capable of eliminating poverty and of bringing about the rational inde­, ,f pendence of people. This and only this can be called organic social development. It is my opinion that the European democracies were de­feated in the fight against dictatorship because the demo­cratic systems were far too laden with formal elements and much too deficient in objective and practical democracy. Fear of vital living determined every educational measure. De­mocracy was looked upon as a condition of guaranteed \"freedom\" and not as the development of responsibility in the masses.

If my scientific obser­vations have the capacity to be conducive to a better organi­zation of human conditions, the purpose of my work shall have been fulfilled. When the dictatorships have come to naught, human society will have need of truths, and precisely unpopular truths. Those truths which have to do with the unadmitted reasons of the present social chaos will eventu­ally prevail, whether people want this to happen or not. One such truth is that dictatorship is rooted in the irrational fear of life in the masses. He who expounds such truths is very much endangered-but he can wait. He does not feel compelled to fight for power for the purpose of enforcing truth. His power is his knowledge of facts which pertain to mankind as a whole. No matter how distasteful such facts may be, in times of extreme social exigency, the society's will to life will force it to acknowledge them, in spite of every­thing else. The scientist is duty-bound to insist on the right of free speech under all conditions; this right must not be left to those whose intent is to suppress life. We hear so much about the duty of a soldier to be willing to sacrifice his life for his country; we hear too little about the duty of a scien­tist to expound a truth once it has been recognized, cost what it may.

Without firmness and se­riousness in vital questions, the fight against the plague of dictatorship is hopeless, for dictatorship thrives-and can only thrive-in the obscurity of unrecognized issues of life and death. Man is helpless when he lacks knowledge; help­lessness due to ignorance is the fertilizer of dictatorship. A social system cannot be called democratic if it is afraid of posing decisive questions, finding unaccustomed answers, and engaging in a discussion about such questions and an­swers. In such a case, it is defeated by the slightest attack on its institutions by would-be dictators. This is what happened in Europe. \"Freedom of religion\" is dictatorship when it does not go hand in hand with freedom of science; for, when this is not the case, there is no free competition in the interpretation of the life process. It must be decided once and for all whether \"God\" is a bearded, all-powerful, divine figure, or whether he represents the cosmic law of nature which governs us. Only if God and the law of nature are identical is an under­standing possible between science and religion. It is but one step from the dictatorship of an earthly representative of God to the dictatorship of a divinely ordained savior of peoples. \"Morality\" is dictatorial when it lumps natural feelings of life together with pornography. In doing so, it per­petuates sexual smut and blights natural happiness in love, whether this is what it intends or not. It is necessary to raise a strong protest when those who determine their social behavior on the basis of inner laws instead of external com­pulsive codes are labeled immoral.

Moralistic bigotry cannot be fought with another form of compulsive morality, but only with knowl­edge of the natural law of the sexual process. Natural moral behavior presupposes that the natural life process can de­velop freely. On the other hand, compulsive morality and pathological sexuality go hand in hand. The line of compulsion is the line of least resistance. It is easier to demand discipline and to enforce it authoritatively than it is to bring up children to take pleasure in doing inde­pendent work and to have a natural attitudG. toward sexual­ity. It is easier to declare oneself to be an omniscient Fuhrer ordained by God, and to decree what millions of people are to think and do, than it is to expose oneself to the struggle between rationality and irrationality in the clash of opinions. It is easier to insist on legal fulfillment of respect and love than it is to win friendship through humane behavior. It is easier to sell one's independence for material security than it is to lead a responsible, independent existence and to be mas­ter of oneself. It is more convenient to dictate the behavior of subordinates than it is to guide this behavior, while pre­serving what is singular in it. This is also why dictatorship is always easier than genuine democracy. This is why the complacent democratic leader envies the dictator and incom­petently seeks to imitate him.

Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact is that a youth filled with activity and experience enabled me to perceive and represent data, peculiarities of research, and results which remained closed to others.

During a lecture on anatomy in January 1919, a handbill was passed around from desk to desk. It called upon interested students to set up a seminar on sexology. I went to the initial meeting. There were some eight young medical students present. It was said that a seminar on sex­ology was necessary for medical students because the U ni­versity of Vienna was neglecting this important question. I regularly attended the seminar, but I did not take part in the discussion. The manner in which this subject was treated in the first sessions sounded strange to me; it lacked the tone of naturalness. There was something in me that rejected it. One of my notes of March 1919 runs as follows: \"Perhaps it is the morality with which the subject is treated that dis­turbs me. From my own experience, from observations made on myself and others, I have reached the conclusion that sex­uality is the center around which the life of society as a whole as well as the inner intellectual world of the individual ... revolves.\" Why did I object? It was not until some ten years later that I found out the reason. I had experienced sexuality differently from the way it was dealt with in that course. There was something bizarre and strange about the sexual­ity of those first lectures. A natural sexuality did not appear to exist at all; the unconscious was full of perverse instincts only. For instance, the psychoanalytic theory denied the ex­istence of a primary vaginal eroticism in young girls and ascribed female sexuality to a complicated combination of other instincts. The suggestion was made to invi te an older psychoanalyst to deliver a series of lectures on sexuality. He spoke well and what he said was interesting, but I had an instinctive dislike for the manner in which he treated the subject. I heard a great deal that was new, and I was very much interested, but somehow the lecturer was not worthy of the subject. I would not have been able to say why this was so. .. h Full text available from the Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 THE FUNCTION OF THE ORGASM I procured a number of works on sexology: Bloch's Sex­ualleben unserer Zeit, Forel's Die sexuelle Frage, Back's Sexuelle Verirrungen, Taruffi's H ermaphroditismus und Zeugungsunfiihigkeit. Then I read Jung's Libido, and finally I read Freud. I read voluminously, quickly, and thoroughly -some works I read two and three times. Freud's Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex and Introductory Lec­tures to Psychoanalysis decided my choice of profession. I immediately separated sexologic literature into two groups: one serious and the other \"moralistic and lascivious.\" I was enthusiastic about Bloch, Forel, and Freud. Freud was a tre­mendous intellectual experience. I did not immediately become a devoted disciple of Freud. I assimilated his discoveries gradually, at the same time studying the ideas and discoveries of other great men. Be­fore I committed myself completely to psychoan~lysis and threw myself into it totally, I acquired a general grounding in natural science and natural philosophy. It was the basic theme of sexuality which compelled me to undertake these studies. I studied Moll's H andbuch der Sexualwissenschaft very thoroughly. I wanted to know what others had to say about the instincts. This led me to Semon. His theory of \"mnemonic sensations\" gave me food for thought on the problems of memory and instinct. Semon contended that the involuntary acts of all living creatures consist in \"engrams,\" i.e., in historical impressions of experiences. The eternally self-perpetuating protoplasm is continually absorbing im­pressions which, responding to corresponding stimuli, are \"ecphorized.\" This biological theory fit in very well with Freud's concept of unconscious remembrances, the \"memory traces.\" The question \"What is life?\" prompted each new acquisition of knowledge.

Between 1919 and 1921, I became familiar with Driesch's Philo sophie des Organischen and his Ordnungslehre. I understood the first book but not the second. It was clear that the mechanistic conception of life, which also dominated our medical studies, could not provide a satisfactory explanation. Driesch's con­tention seemed incontestable to me. He argued that, in the sphere of the life function, the whole could be developed from a part, whereas a machine could not be made from a screw. On the other hand, his use of the concept of \"en­telechy\" to explain living functioning was unconvincing. I had the feeling that an enormous problem was evaded with a word. Thus, in a very primitive way, I learned to draw a clear distinction between facts and theories about facts. I gave considerable thought to Driesch's three proofs of the specific totally different characteristic of living matter as op­posed to inorganic matter. They were well-grounded proofs. However, I couldn't quite accept the transcendentalism of the life principle. Seventeen years later I was able to resolve the contradiction on the basis of a formula pertaining to the function of energy. Driesch's theory was always present in my mind when I thought about vitalism. The vague feeling I had about the irrational nature of his assumption turned out to be justified in the end. He landed among the spiritualists. I had more success with Bergson. I made an exceedingly careful study of his Malter and Memory, Time and Free­dom, and Creative Evolution. Instinctively, I sensed the cor­rectness of his efforts to refute mechanistic materialism as well as finalism. Bergson's elucidation of the perception of time duration in psychic experience and of the unity of the ego confirmed my own inner perceptions of the non­mechanistic nature of the organism. All of this was very ob­scure and vague-more feeling than knowledge.

For a time I was looked upon as a \"crazy Berg­sonian.\" While I agreed with Bergson in principle, I was not able to point out the hiatus in his theory. His ''t~lan vital\" very much reminded me of Driesch's \"entelechy.\" The prin­ciple of a creative force which governed life could not be gainsaid. Yet, it was not satisfactory as long as it could not be made tangible, described and dealt with concretely. Prac­tical applicability was justifiably looked upon as the supreme goal of natural science. The vitalists always seemed to me to be closer to an understanding of the life principle than the mechanists, who cut life to pieces before endeavoring to comprehend it. On the other hand, the idea that the organ­ism operated like a machine was intellectually more acces­sible. One could draw parallels to known material in the field of physics. I was a mechanist in my medical work, and my thinking tended to be oversystematic. Of my preclinical subjects, I was most interested in systematic and topographic anatomy. I mastered the anatomy of the brain and all of the nervous system. I was fascinated by the complexity of the nerve tracts and by the ingenious arrangement of the ganglia. I learned far more than was required for the medical degree. At the same time, however, I was drawn to metaphysics. I liked Lange's Geschichte des M aterialismus because it clearly showed the indispensability of the idealistic philosophy of life. Some of my colleagues were annoyed by my \"errati­cism\" and \"inconsistency of thinking.\" It was not until seven­teen years later, when I succeeded in experimentally resolving the contradiction between mechanism and vitalism, that I myself understood this seemingly confused attitude.

The versatility of my intellectual interests made me real­ize that \"everyone is right in some way\"-it is merely a matter of knowing \"how.\" I studied two or three books on the history of philosophy, which acquainted me with the im­memorial controversy over whether the body or the mind is primary. These early stages of my scientific development were important, for they prepared me for the correct com­prehension of Freud's theory.

Later, my own problems forced me to make more clear-cut distinctions between fact and hypothesis. Hertwig's Allgemeine Biologie and Das Werden der Organismen provided well-grounded knowledge, but they failed to show the interrelation between the various branches of natural science. I could not have put it into these words at that time, but I was not satisfied. I was disturbed by the application of the \"teleological principle\" in the field of biology. According to this principle, the cell had a membrane in order to better protect itself against external stimuli. The male sperm cell was so agile in order to have greater facility in getting to the female egg. The male ani­mals were bigger and stronger than the female animals and were often more colorful in order to be more attractive to the female, or they had horns in order to be more adept at dealing with their rivals.

In short, a mixture of vitalistic finalism and causal materialism also reigned in the field of biology. I attended Kammerer's very interesting lectures on his theory of the heredity of acquired characteristics. Kammerer was very much influenced by Steinach, who gained prominence at that time with his great works on the hormonal intersti tial tissues of the genital apparatus. 'The influencing of sexual and sec­ondary sexual characteristics by means of the implantation experiment and Kammerer's modification of the mechanistic theory of heredity made a strong impression on me. Kam­merer was a convinced champion of the natural organization of life from inorganic matter and of the existence of a spe­cific biological energy. Naturally, I was not able to make any concrete judgments. It was merely that I was attracted by these scientific views. They brought life into the material which was dryly dished out to us at the university. Both Steinach and Kammerer were sharply opposed. I once made an appointment to see Steinach. When I saw him, I had the impression that he was tired and worn. Later I had a better understanding of how one is wantonly maltreated because of good scientific work. Kammerer later committed suicide. It is so easy to mount the high horse of criticism when one lacks objective arguments. I again ran across the \"in order to\" of biology in various doctrines of salvation. I read Grimm's Buddha and was stunned by the inner logic of the theory of Nirvana, which also rejected joy because it inevitably entailed suffering. I found the theory of the transmutation of souls ridiculous, but I was at a loss to explain why millions of people adhered to such a belief. Fear of death could not be the full explana­tion. I never read Rudolf Steiner, but I knew many theoso­phists and anthroposophists.

I had examined the various conceptions of sexuality as expounded by Forel, Moll, Bloch, Freud, and Jung. It was striking just how differently these scientists regarded sexuality. With the ex­ception of Freud, they all believed that sexuality seized man at the age of puberty from out of a clear blue sky. It was said that \"sexuality awakened.\" Noone was able to say where it had been before this time. Sexuality and procreation were regarded as one and the same thing. Behind this one erroneous conception lay concealed a mountain of psycholog­ical and sociological errors. Moll spoke of a \"tumescence\" and a \"detumescence,\" but no one was quite able to say what their origin was, nor what function they had. Sexual tension and relaxation were ascribed to various special instincts. In the sexology and psychiatric psychology of that time, there were as many, or almost as many, instincts as there were hu­man actions. There was a hunger instinct, a propagation in­stinct, an exhibition instinct, an instinct for power, an instinct for self-assertion, a survival instinct, a maternal instinct, an evolutionary instinct, a cultural and a herd instinct, naturally also a social instinct, an egoistic and an altruistic instinct, a separate instinct for algolagnia (instinct to suffer pain) and one for masochism, a sadistic instinct, and a transvest­ism instinct. In short, it was very simple and yet terribly complicated. There was no making heads or tails of it. Worst of all was the \"moral instinct.\" Today very few people know that morality was once regarded as a phyloge­netically, indeed supernaturally, determined instinct. This was said in complete seriousness and with great dignity. It was altogether a terribly ethical period. Sexual perver­sions were matters of pure diabolism, moral \"degeneracy.\" The same was true of psychic illnesses.

ORGASM L from mental depression or neurasthenia had a \"hereditary taint,\" that is to say, he or she was \"bad.\" Mental patients and criminals were looked upon as biologically tainted, se­verely deformed creatures, for whom there was no help and no excuse. The man of \"genius\" was looked upon as some­thing akin to an abortive criminal, at best a caprice of nature -and not as a person who had shunned the cultural sterility of the world around him and had preserved a contact with nature. Listening to Beethoven's symphonies, the rich, i.e., the good and the just, would like to obliterate the ignominy of Beethoven's death in wretched isolation and poverty. It is merely necessary to read Wulffen's book on criminal­ity or the psychiatry of Pilcz, Kraepelin, or anyone else of that time. One does not quite know whether one is dealing with moral theology or science. Nothing was known about psychic and sexual illnesses; their existence merely aroused indignation, and the gaps in knowledge were filled in with an utterly contemptible morality. Everything was hereditary, i.e., biologically determined, and that was the end of it. The fact that such a hopeless and intellectually cowardly atti­tude was able to conquer the German empire fourteen years later, in spite of all the scientific efforts which were made in the interim, is to be ascribed in part to the social indifference of the pioneers of science. I intuitively rejected this meta­physics, moral philosophy, and \"ethicizing.\" I looked in vain for facts in substantiation of these doctrines. In the biological works of a man such as Mendel, who had studied the laws of heredity, I found far greater confirmation of the variabil­ity of hereditary succession than I did of its proclaimed rigid uniformity. It did not dawn upon me that 99 percent of the theory of heredity is one stupendous subterfuge. On the other hand, I was very much taken by de Vries's mutation theory, Steinach's and Kammerer's experiments, Fliess's and Swoboda's theory of frequency. Darwin's theory of natural selection fulfilled the reasonable expectation that, while basic .. h Full text available from the Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"BIOLOGY AND SEXOLOGY BEFORE FREUD 29 /natural laws govern life, circumstantial influences must be allowed the greatest possible latitude. There was nothing eternally immutable here; nothing was traced back to unseen hereditary factors. Everything was capable of development. It never entered my mind to relate the sexual instinct to these biological theories. I had no inclination for specula. tions. The sexual instinct eked out a meager existence in the field of science. One has to be familiar with this atmosphere in the fields of sexology and psychiatry before Freud to understand the enthusiasm and relief which I felt when I encountered him. Freud had paved a road to a clinical understanding of sex­uality. He showed that adult sexuality proceeds from stages of sexual development in childhood. It was immediately clear: sexuality and procreation are not the same. The words \"sexual\" and \"genital\" could not be used interchangeably, The sexual experience comprises a far greater realm than the genital experience, otherwise perversions such as pleas­ure in coprophagy, in filth, or in sadism could not be called sexual. Freud exposed contradictions in thinking and brought in logic and order. The pre-Freudian writers used the concept of \"libido\" to denote simply the conscious appetite for sexual activity. It was not known what \"libido\" was or should be. Freud said, We cannot concretely grasp what instinct is. What we expe­rience are merely derivatives of instinct: sexual ideas and affects. Instinct itself lies deep in the biological core of the organism; it becomes manifest as an affective urge for gratifi­cation. We sense the urge for relaxation but not the instinct itself. This was a profound thought; it was understood nei­ther by those sympathetic to nor those inimical toward psy­choanalysis. It constituted a foundation of natural-scientific thinking upon which one could build with confidence.

Take electricity, for example. We do not know what it is or how it originates. We recognize it only through its manifestations, such as in light and in elec~ trical shock. True, an electrical wave can be measured, but it too is only a characteristic of what we call electricity. Just as electricity is capable of being measured through its manifes­tations of energy, the instincts are capable of being recog­nized only through the manifestation of their affects. Freud's \"libido,\" I concluded, is not the same as the \"libido\" of pre-Freudians. The latter denotes the conscious sexual longings. Freud's \"libido\" is and can be nothing other than the energy of the sexual instinct. It is possible that someday we shall be capable of measuring it. It was entirely without conscious premeditation that I used the simile of electricity and its energy. I had no idea that sixteen years later I would have the good fortune of demonstrating the identity be­tween bioelectric and sexual energy. Freud's consistent, nat­ural-scientific thinking in terms of energy captivated me. It was objective and lucid. The seminar on sexology enthusiastically accepted my elu­cidation. They had heard that Freud interpreted symbols and dreams and did other curious things. I had succeeded in establishing a connection between Freud and known theories of sex. In the fall of 1919, I was elected to the chairmanship of the seminar. In this position, I learned to bring order into scientific work. Groups were formed to study the various branches of sexology: endocrinology and the general theory of hormones, the biology of sex-above all, psychoanalysis. In the beginning, we studied the sociology of sex from the books of Miiller-Lyer. One medical student delivered lec­tures on Tandler's ideas on social hygiene, another taught us embryology. Of the original thirty participants, only some eight remained, but they did serious work. We moved into the basement of the Hayek Clinic.

We were already well acquainted with the attitude of the university professors to­ward sexuality. It no longer bothered us. We looked upon the omission of sexology in our studies as a severe disadvan­tage, and we sought to inform ourselves as best we could. I learned a great deal in preparing a course on the anatomy and physiology of the sexual organs. I had gathered my ma­terial from various textbooks in which the sexual organs were represented solely as serving the purpose of reproduc­tion. This did not even seem strange. Nothing was said about how the sexual organs were related to the autonomic nervous system; what was said about their relation to the sexual hormones was vague and unsatisfactory. We learned that \"substances\" were produced in the interstitial glands of the testicle and of the ovary and that these \"substances\" de­termined secondary sexual characteristics and brought about sexual maturity in puberty. They were also represented as the cause of sexual excitation. These researchers did not no­tice the contradiction that men castrated before puberty have a reduced sexuality, while men castrated after puberty do not lose their sexuaJ excitability and are capable of the sexual act. The fact that eunuchs develop a singular sadism was not regarded as a problem. It was not until many years later, when I was afforded an insight into the mechanisms of sexual energy, that I understood these phenomena. After puberty, sexuality is fully developed, and castration cannot affect it. Sexual energy operates in the whole body and not solely in the interstitial tissues of the gonads. The sadism which eunuchs develop is nothing other than the sexual energy which, deprived of its normal genital function, seizes the musculature of the whole body. In the physiology of that time, the concept of sexuality did not extend beyond the com­prehension of the individual points of attachment of the sex­ual mechanism, e.g., the interstitial tissues of the testicles and/or ovaries; it described nothing more than the second. .. b Full text available from the Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"I 32 THE FUNCTION OF THE ORGASM ary sexual characteristics. It was for this reason that Freud's explanation of the sexual function had a liberating effect. True, in Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex, he still assumed the existence of \"chemical substances,\" which were said to be the cause of sexual excitation. He investigated the phenomena of sexual excitation, spoke of an \"organ libido,\" and ascribed to each cell that strange \"something\" which in­fluences our life to such a large extent. I was later able to experimentally confirm these intimations on Freud's part. Psychoanalysis gradually gained supremacy over all other disciplines. My first analysis was of a young man whose chief symptom was the compulsion to walk fast. He was not able to walk slowly. The symbolism which he offered in his dreams did not appear very unusual to me. Indeed, its logic very often surprised me. Most people found Freud's inter­pretation of symbols rather fantastic. I was familiar with symbolism not only from Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, but also from my own dreams, which I had often unraveled. I have a series of my own dream analyses. The work on my first patient went very well-too well, as is usually the case with beginners. The beginner has a way of being insensitive to the inscrutable depth of the unconscious and of overlooking the complexity of the problems. I was very proud when I succeeded in analyzing the meaning of the .1 compulsive action. As a small boy, the patient had once stolen something from a store and had run off in fear of be­ing pursued. He had repressed this incident. It reappeared in his \"having to walk fast.\" In connection with this, it was easy to demonstrate his childhood fear of being caught in the act of clandestine masturbation. There was even an im­provement in his condition. I also discovered a number of indications of the patient's deep sexual attachment to his mother. On the point of technique, I proceeded exactly in accord­ance with the instructions set forth in Freud's works. This is ~ Full text available from the Wilhelm Reich Infant Trust http://www.wilhelmreichtrust.org"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"BIOLOGY AND SEXOLOGY BEFORE FREUD 33 how the analysis took place: the patient lay flat on the couch, the analyst sitting behind him. If possible, the patient was to avoid turning around. Looking back at the analyst was re­garded as \"resistance.\" The patient was urged to \"free asso­ciate.\" He was not supposed to suppress anything that came to mind. He was supposed to say everything-but do noth­ing. The main task was to lead him \"from acting to remem­bering.\" Dreams were analyzed fragment by fragment, one after the other in succession. The patient was supposed to produce associations to every fragment. There was a logical conception behind this procedure. The neurotic symptom is the manifestation of a repressed instinctual impulse which has broken through the repression in a disguised form. It followed from this that, if the analyst proceeded in a techni­cally correct way, the unconscious sexual desire and the mor­alistic defense against it would have to be discovered in the symptom. For instance, a hysterical girl's anxiety about be­ing attacked by men armed with knives is a disguised rep­resentation of the desire for sexual intercourse inhibited by morality and thrust into the unconscious through repression. The symptom results from the unconsciousness of the pro­hibited instinctual impulse, e.g., to masturbate or to engage in sexual intercourse. In the above case, the pursuer repre­sents the girl's own qualms of conscience which preclude di­rect expression of the instinctual desire. Barred from direct manifestation, the impulse seeks disguised possibilities of ex­pression, e.g., stealing or fear of being attacked. The cure, according to Freud, is brought about by making the re­pressed drive conscious and thus accessible to the condemna­tion of the mature ego. Since the unconsciousness of a desire is the condition of the symptom, making it conscious must produce a cure. Some years later, Freud himself questioned this formulation. Initially, however, cure was said to be de­pendent upon the making conscious of the repressed instinct­ual impulse and on its condemnation or sublimation. ..

When I began to develop my genital theory of therapy, people ascribed it to Freud or rejected it totally. To comprehend my later disagreement with Freud, it is important to note its roots in these early stages of my work. In the first years of my psychoanalytic work, I partially cured and even com­pletely eliminated many symptoms. I did this by adhering to the principle of making unconscious impulses conscious. In 1920, there was no hint of \"character\" and \"character neu­rosis.\" Quite the contrary: the individual neurotic symptom was explicitly regarded as an alien element in an otherwise healthy psychic organism. This is a decisive point. It was said that a part of the personality had failed to go along with the total development toward adulthood, thus remain­ing behind at an earlier stage of sexual development. This resulted in a \"fixation.\" What happened then was that this isolated part came into conflict with the remainder of the ego, by which it was held in repression. My later theory of character, on the other hand, maintained that there cannot be a neurotic symptom without a disturbance of the char­acter as a whole. Symptoms are merely peaks on the mountain ridge which the neurotic character represents. I developed this conception wholly in accord with the psycho­analytic theory of neurosis. It made definite demands upon technique and led finally to formulations which were at vari­ance with psychoanalysis. As chairman of the student seminar on sexology, it was my job to procure literature. I paid visits to Kammerer, Steinach, Stekel, Bucura (a professor of biology), Alfred Adler, and Freud. Freud's personality made the greatest, strongest, and most lasting impression. Kammerer was dis­cerning and kind, but was not especially interested. Steinach complained about his own difficulties. Stekel sought to be impressive. Adler was disappointing. He railed against Freud. He, not Freud, was the one who had the real insight. ..

At some other time, I shall have to describe the areas in which he was right, the injus­tices he suffered, and the reasons why his theory did not hold up. Freud was different. Whereas the others all played some kind of role, whether that of the professor, the great dis­cerner of human character, or the distinguished scientist, Freud did not put on any airs. He spoke with me like a com­pletely ordinary person. He had bright, intelligent eyes, which did not seek to penetrate another person's eyes in some sort of mantic pose, but simply looked at the world in an honest and truthful way. He inquired about our work in the seminar and found it very sensible. We were right, he said. It was regrettable that people demonstrated no interest or only a sham interest in sexuality. He would be only too happy to provide us with literature. He knelt down in front of his bookcase and eagerly picked out a number of books and pamphlets. They were special editions of The J7i­cissitudes of Instincts, The Unconscious, a copy of The In­terpretation of Dreams, a copy of The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, etc. Freud spoke rapidly, objectively, and animatedly.

From that day on, I spent fourteen years of intensive work in and for psychoanalysis. In the end, I was severely disappointed in Freud.

Like comets, some of them rose to the top-promising much, accomplishing nothing. Others were like moles, laboriously working them­selves through difficult problems of the unconscious without ever once savoring the comprehensive view which Freud offered. Then there were others who sought to compete with Freud, without having grasped the fact that Freud was set apart from conventional academic science by his adherence to the subject of \"sexuality.\" And finally there were those who quickly seized a fragment of the theory and translated it into a profession. Objectively seen, however, it was not a matter of competing with Freud or of establishing a profes­sion, but of advancing an enormous discovery. At issue was more than the elaboration of known material; essentially, it was a matter of discovering the biological basis of the libido theory through experimentation.
