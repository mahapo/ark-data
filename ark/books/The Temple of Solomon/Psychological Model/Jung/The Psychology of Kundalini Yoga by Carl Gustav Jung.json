Throughout India gatherings took a pledge that began:We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as ofany other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of theirtoil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full oppor-tunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprivesa people of these rights and oppresses them, the people have thefurther right to alter it or to abolish it. The British Government inIndia has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom buthas based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruinedIndia economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually. We be-lieve that India must sever the British connection and attain PurnaSwaraj or complete independence.1Civil disobedience was proclaimed, Gandhi commenced his salt march,and Nehru was imprisoned.*Munich,30May. At a memorial for his deceased colleague, the sinologistRichard Wilhelm, Jung echoed these dramatic events:If we look to the East: an overwhelming destiny is fulfilling itself. . . .We have conquered the East politically. Do you know what hap-pened, when Rome subjugated the near East politically? The spiritof the East entered Rome. Mithras became the Roman militarygod. . . . Would it be unthinkable that the same thing happenedtoday and we would be just as blind as the cultured Romans, whomarvelled at the superstitions of the Christians? . . . I know thatour unconscious is crammed with Eastern symbolism. The spiritof the East is reallyante portas. . . . I consider the fact that Wilhelmand the Indologist Hauer were invited to lecture on yoga at thisyear’s congress of German psychotherapists, as an extremely sig-nificant sign of the times.2Consider what it means, when the1In Jawaharlal Nehru,An Autobiography(London,1989),612.2Hauer spoke on “Der Yoga im Lichte der Psychotherapie” (Yoga in the light of psycho-therapy), inBericht über den V.

For journeyers to the East, he was adopted as aforefather. At the same time, these interests of Jung together with theirappropriation by the counterculture were seen by many as confirmationof the mystical obscurantism of his psychology.YOGA AND THE NEW PSYCHOLOGYThe emergence of depth psychology was historically paralleled by thetranslation and widespread dissemination of the texts of yoga.4Bothwere topical, exotic novelties. Newly arrived gurus and yogins vied withpsychotherapists over a similar clientele who sought other counsel thanwas provided by Western philosophy, religion, and medicine. Hence thecomparison between the two was not to be unexpected (not least by thepotential customers). While a great deal had already been written com-paring Eastern and Western thought,5the advent of the new depth psy-3“Richard Wilhelm: In Memoriam,” inCW, vol.15, §90; translation modified.

Further, the initiatory structure adoptedby institutions of psychotherapy brought its social organization intoproximity with that of yoga. Hence an opportunity for a new form ofcomparative psychology opened up.As early as1912,inTransformation and Symbols of the Libido, Jung pro-vided psychological interpretations of passages in theUpanishadsand theRig Veda.6While this opened the possibility of a comparison between thepractice of analysis and that of yoga, possibly the first explicit compari-son was made by F. I. Winter in “The Yoga System and Psychoanalysis.”7He contrasted psychoanalysis, as depicted in the work of Freud andJung, with Patanjali’sYoga Sutras. Before Jung himself took up the sub-ject, his work was already being compared to yoga—and the “new pathsin psychology” that he sought to open up since leaving the auspices ofthe International Psychoanalytical Association promised to be the mostfertile crossroads between Eastern and Western approaches.An account of Jung’s encounter with Eastern thought would be in-complete without mention of Count Hermann Keyserling and hisSchool of Wisdom at Darmstadt, which provided a collegiate environ-ment for Jung’s explorations. Keyserling dealt with yoga in hisThe TravelDiar y of a Philosopher, which was a much-acclaimed work. He contendedthat the new psychology actually represented a rediscovery of what wasalready known by the ancient Indians: “Indian wisdom is the profound-est which exists....Thefurtherweget,themoreclosely do we approachthe views of the Indians. Psychological research confirms, step by step,the assertions contained . . . within the old Indian science of the soul.”86Gopi Krishna later criticized Jung’s interpretation of a Vedic hymn concerning the pro-ducion of fire through the rubbing of sticks in which Jung saw ‘unequivocal coitus symbol-ism’ (SeePsychology of the Unconscious, translated by Beatrice Hinkle,CW, supplement B,§§243–45), stating that “the terms used clearly point to the fire produced by Kundalini.”Kundalini for the New Age: Selected Writings of Gopi Krishna, edited by Gene Kieffer (New York,1988),67.7F.

Jung (who did not know Sanskrit) subsequently had similar collab-orations with figures such as Heinrich Zimmer, Walter Evans-Wentz,Daisetz Suzuki, and in this instance Wilhelm Hauer, who representedthe leading commentators on Eastern thought in Jung’s day.12The comparison between yoga and psychoanalysis was further ex-plored by Keyserling’s associate Oskar Schmitz inPsychoanalyse undYoga,13which Schmitz dedicated to Keyserling. Schmitz claimed that ofthe schools of psychoanalysis it was Jung’s rather than Freud’s or Adler’sthat lay closest to yoga: “With the Jungian system for the first time thepossibility enters that psychoanalysis can contribute to human higher de-9Keyserling,The Travel Diary of a Philosopher,124–25.10Ibid.,95.

Jung: “The East bases itself upon psychic reality, that is, upon the psycheas the main and unique condition of existence.” “Psychological Commentary on ‘The Ti-betan Book of the Great Liberation,’ ” inCW, vol.11, §770. ( Jung’s commentary was writtenin1939and first published in1954). Such characterizations follow a long line of orientalistspeculations in which Indian thought was characterized as dreamlike (Hegel) or as beingdominated by imagination (Schlegel). See Ronald Inden,Imagining India(London,1990),93–97.11Jung,CW, vol.13.12This period of scholarship is increasingly coming in for reappraisal. SeeHeinrichZimmer: Coming into His Own, edited by Margaret Case (Princeton,1994), andA Zen Life:D. T. Suzuki Remembered, edited by Masao Abe (New York,1986). Expressions of recipro-cal admiration between Jung and his colleagues were frequent. For example, on receiv-ing his commentary to theThe Tibetan Book of the Great Liberation, Evans-Wentz wroteto Jung that it was anhonor to beable to include a contribution from “the foremostauthority in the West on the Science of the Mind” (Evans-Wentz to Jung,13July1939,ETH).13Oskar Schmitz,Psychoanalyse und Yoga(Darmstadt,1923).xx"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONvelopment....Itisnotamethodofyoga, and does not even want to beone, but possibly Jung’s system is such.”14Jung’s response to Schmitz’swork was equivocal:Inasmuch as I regard the psychoanalytical and psychosyntheticmethods likewise as means of self-improvement, your comparisonwith the yoga method seems thoroughly plausible to me. It appearsto me, however, as one must emphasize, that it is merely an analogywhich is involved, since nowadays far too many Europeans are in-clined to carry Eastern ideas and methods over unexamined intoour occidental mentality. This happens, in my opinion, neither toour advantage nor to the advantage of those ideas. For what hasemerged from the Eastern spirit is based upon the peculiar historyof that mentality, which is most fundamentally different fromours.15TANTRISM AND KUNDALINI YOGAThe omnipresence of yoga classes alongside aerobics, weight training,massage, and other sects of the contemporary body cults at sports andfitness centers makes it easy to forget that yoga is an ancient spiritualdiscipline.Yoga partakes of two notions generally held in common in Indian phi-losophy and religion—reincarnation, and the quest for emancipationfrom the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Mircea Eliade stated that foryoga and Svôkhya philosophy to which it is related, in contrast to otherIndian schools of thought, “the world isreal(not illusory—as it is, forexample, for Vedvnta). Nevertheless, if the worldexistsandendures,itisbecause of the ‘ignorance’ of spirit.”16What distinguishes yoga is its es-sentially practical cast. Surendranath Dasgupta noted: “The yoga philos-ophy has essentially a practical tone and its object consists mainly indemonstrating the means of attaining salvation, oneness, the liberationof purusha.”17Many different definitions and accounts of yoga have14Ibid.,65, translated by Eric Donner.15Jung to Schmitz,26May1923, “C.

Eliade stated: “Etymologically,yogaderives from the rootyuj,‘to bind together,’ ‘hold fast,’ ‘yoke.’... The wordyogaserves, in gen-eral, to designate anyascetic techniqueand anymethod of meditation.”18ForFeuerstein, “Yoga is a specifically Indian tradition consisting of sets ofvaryingly codified and/or systematized ideas, attitudes, methods andtechniques primarily intended to induce a transformation in the practi-tioner (yogin) and transmitted from one teacher to one or more disciplesin a more or less formal setting.”19The earliest traces of yoga have beentraced to the third millenniumB.C.20There are several main schools ofyoga: Raja yoga, Hatha yoga, Jnana yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga, Man-tra yoga, Laya yoga, and Kundalini yoga. To characterize the latter, it isuseful to consider several general features of the tantric movement.Tantrism was a religious and philosophical movement that becamepopular from the fourth century onward and influenced Indian philoso-phy, mysticism, ethics, art, and literature. Agehananda Bharati stated,“What distinguishes tantric from other Hindu and Buddhist teaching isits systematic emphasis on the identity of the absolute [paramvrtha]andthe phenomenal [vyavahvra] world when filtered through the experi-ence of worship [svdhanv].”21Tantrism was anti-ascetic and anti-specu-lative, and represented a transgressive countercurrent to mainstreamHinduism. It rejected the prevalent caste system and represented atransvaluation of values. In tantrism there was a celebration of the body,which was seen as the microcosm of the universe. In contrast to the mas-culinist cast of traditional Hinduism, Eliade noted that in tantrism, “forthe first time in the spiritual history of Aryan India, the Great Goddessacquires a predominant position.... Wealso recognize a sort of reli-ETH). The following year Jung invited Dasgupta to lecture in Zurich: “We should be muchobliged if you would give us a talk about the relation of mind and body according to yogain your Saturday lecture at the Psychol. Club. As a theme for the lecture at the Polytechni-cum I would propose Psychology or Philosophy of Yoga (specially Patanjali Yoga Sutra).”( Jung to Dasgupta,17April1939,ETH). Dasgupta lectured to the Psychological Club inMay.18Eliade,Yoga: Immortality and Freedom,4.19Feuerstein,The Yoga-Sutra of Patanjali: An Exercise in the Methodology of Textual Analysis(London,1979),1.20Vivian Worthington,A History of Yoga(London,1989),11.21Agehananda Bharati,The Tantric Tradition(London,1992),18.

Zimmer stated that tantrism “in-sists on the holiness and purity of all things; hence, the ‘five forbiddenthings’ . . . constitute the substance of the sacramental fare in certaintantric rites: wine, meat, fish, parched grain, and sexual intercourse.”23In what are known as the “right-handed” schools these are used in ritualssymbolically, whereas in the “left-handed” schools they are used literally.Apropos the contemporary perception of tantrism Jacob Needlemanaptly noted that “the moment one hears the word ‘tantrism,’ various wildand lurid associations spring forth in the Western mind which add up toapasticheof psychospiritual science fiction and sexual acrobatics thatwould put to shame even the most imaginative of our contemporary por-nographers and quite eclipse the achievements of our hardiest eroticwarriors.”24The intersection of the new age movement and the sexualrevolution in the sixties led to increasing interest in tantrism in the Westaccompanied by numerous “how to do it” manuals that focused on itsritualized sexual practices—often glossed in the process was that in tan-trism, such practices were directed not toward the liberation of sexualityper se but toward liberation from the cycle of rebirth.Jung specified his psychological understanding of tantric yoga asfollows:Indian philosophy is namely the interpretation given to the precisecondition of the non-ego, which affects our personal psychology,however independent from us it remains. It sees the aim of humandevelopment as bringing about an approach to and connection be-tween the specific nature of the non-ego and the conscious ego.Tantra yoga then gives a representation of the condition and thedevelopmental phases of this impersonality, as it itself in its own wayproduces the light of a higher suprapersonal consciousness.25At a time when psychology was characterized by the reign of behavior-22Eliade,Yoga: Immortality and Freedom,202.

These are located in different parts of the body andlinked by channels (nvìzs), the most important of which are theiìv,piõgalv,andsuüumõv. Most commentators concur that the cakras andthenvìzsare not intended as physiological depictions of the body in thecontemporary Western sense but represent a subtle or mystical body.Feuerstein described them as “idealized version of the structure of thesubtle body, which are meant to guide the yogin’s visualisation andcontemplation.”26Jung’s lectures are principally taken up with providing a modern psy-chological interpretation of the cakras. Narendra Nath Bhattacharyyastated that the cakras are best understood through seeing their differentcomponents as constituted by a process of historical layering:From a historical point of view it may be suggested that thepadmasorcakraswere originally conceived of in terms of human anatomyfor the purpose of physiological study. . . . At a subsequent stage, inconformity with the tantric idea that the human body is the micro-cosm of the universe, worldly objects such as the sun, moon, moun-tains, rivers, etc., were connected with thesecakras. Eachcakrawasagain thought to represent the gross and the subtle elements . . .quite in accordance with the tantric idea that the deities residewithin the human body and that the aspirant has to feel the deitywithin the body itself. Thesecakrascame to be conceived of as theseat of the male and female principles, symbolized by the male andfemale organs. . . .

Feuerstein de-fined the Kundalini as “a microcosmic manifestation of the primordialEnergy, or Shakti. It is the Universal Power as it is connected with thefinite body-mind.”28The object is to awaken Kundalini through ritualpractices and to enable her ascent up thesuüumõvnvìzthrough thecakra system. When it reaches the topmost cakra the blissful union ofåiva andåakti occurs. This leads to a far-reaching transformation of thepersonality.29JUNG’S ENCOUNTER WITH YOGAInMemories, Dreams, Reflections, Jung recounted how during his “confron-tation with the unconscious” around the time of the First World War, “Iwas frequently so wrought up that I had to eliminate the emotionsthrough yoga practices. But since it was my purpose to learn what wasgoing on within myself, I would do them only until I had calmed myselfand could take up again the work with the unconscious.”30In Hauer’s last English lecture (see appendix3), Jung gave an accountof how his interest in Kundalini was awakened through an encounterwith a European woman brought up in the East who presented dreamsand fantasies that he could not understand until he came across Sir John27Bhattacharyya,History of the Tantric Religion,324–25.28Feuerstein,Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy,264.29For a fascinating firsthand account of the awakening of the Kundalini accompanied bya lucid psychological commentary, see Gopi Krishna,Kundalini: The Evolutionary Energy inMan, with a psychological commentary by James Hillman (London,1970).

He described his intention as follows: “We, who are for-eigners, must place ourselves in the skin of the Hindu, and must look attheir doctrine and ritual through their eyes and not our own.”35Jung claimed that the symbolism of Kundalini yoga suggested that thebizarre symptomatology that patients at times presented actually re-sulted from the awakening of the Kundalini. He argued that knowledgeof such symbolism enabled much that would otherwise be seen as themeaningless by-products of a disease process to be understood as mean-ingful symbolic processes, and explicated the often peculiar physicallocalizations of symptoms.36With the hegemony of the biochemical ap-31Arthur Avalon (pseud.

Itwasn’t long before dysentery overcame Dr. Jung and I had to takehim to the English hospital at Calcutta. . . . A more lasting effectof this impression of the destructiveness of Kali was the emotionalfoundation it gave him for the conviction that evil was not a nega-tive thing but a positive thing. . . . The influence of that experi-ence in India, to my mind, was very great on Jung in his lateryears.42In “Yoga and the West” Jung delimited his brief as follows:I will be silent on the meaning of yoga for India, because I can-not presume to pass judgment on something I do not know frompersonal experience. I can, however, say something about whatit means for the West. Our lack of direction borders on psychicanarchy. Therefore any religious or philosophical practice amountsto apsychological discipline, and thereforea method of psychic hygiene.43cutta wrote to Ellenberger on10May1967that “the degree of Doctor of Law (HonorisCausa) was conferred upon Dr. Charles Gustave Jung in absentia by this University ata special Convocation held on7th January,1938. . . .

After his trip toIndia, however, Jung became less circumspect in this regard: “Tantric yoga is in rather badrepute in India; it is criticised because it is connected with the body, particularly with sex,”Modern Psychology3,42; and “Yoga is mainly found in India now as a business propositionand woe to us when it reaches Europe,” ibid.,69.xxviii"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThus Jung’s interest, in contrast with Dasgupta’s, were with yoga not as“philosophy and religion” but as psychology. Hence his definition ofyoga was a psychological one: “Yoga was originally a natural process ofintroversion.... Such introversions lead to characteristic inner pro-cesses of personality changes. In the course of several thousand yearsthese introversions became gradually organized as methods, and alongwidely differing ways.”44Jung’s concern was not primarily with the ca-nonical and organized methods and teachings of yoga but with the puta-tive natural processes of introversion that originally underlay them. Thisperspective legitimized the liberties that he took with the former in theseminar that follows. Jung saw the inner processes to which yoga gaverise as universal, and the particular methods employed to achieve themas culturally specific.45For Jung, yoga represented a rich storehouse ofsymbolic depictions of inner experience and of the individuation pro-cess in particular. He claimed that “important parallels with yoga [andanalytical psychology] have come to light, especially with Kundalini yogaand the symbolism of tantric yoga, Lamaism, and Taoistic yoga in China.These forms of yoga with their rich symbolism afford me invaluable com-parative material for the interpretation of the collective unconscious.”46Jung’s aim was to develop a cross-cultural comparative psychology ofinner experience. Hence he was concerned to differentiate his approachfrom indigenous Eastern understandings, as represented in the mis-sionary efforts of the Ramakrishna movement and such advocates as Ro-main Rolland,47the Western appropriation of Eastern teachings, such asby the theosophists, Hauer’s historico-existential approach, and thespiritual valorization of Eastern thought by Keyserling’s School of Wis-dom, and contrastingly to demonstrate the specificity of a psychologicalviewpoint.Throughout his writings on Eastern thought, while Jung promoted44Jung, “Yoga and the West,” §873; translation modified.45On reading Gopi Krishna’s account of his experiences, the Jungian analyst JohnLayard noted that his descriptions of the awakening of the Kundalini “correspond soclosely to what I have referred to as my ‘feinting experiences,’ with similar noises & sensa-tions, which were truly terrifying, & mixed up also with highly mystical ones, also of coursePsychosexual, that I’m wondering whether something of the same kind may have beenhappening to me—The devilish outcome of an almost divine experience. We in the Westare so lacking in the true religiosity that we have lost the threads, & get good things somuddled up with bad, that we have lost the purity of divine dirt!” ( John Layard to AnthonyStadlen,17October1968; personal possession of Anthony Stadlen.)46Jung, “Yoga and the West,” §875; translation modified.47Romain Rolland,Prophets of the New India, translated by Malcolm Smith (London,1930).xxix"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONand endorsed their study he cautioned against their practice by Western-ers: “There are many different kinds of yoga and Europeans often be-come hypnotized by it, but it is essentially Eastern, no European has thenecessary patience and it is not right for him.... The more westudyyoga, the more we realize how far it is from us; a European can onlyimitate it and what he acquires by this is of no real interest.”48For Jungthe danger was one of mimetic madness: “The European who practicesyoga does not know what he is doing. It has a bad effect upon him,sooner or later he gets afraid and sometimes it even leads him over theedge of madness.”49This led him to conclude that “in the course of thecenturies the West will produce its own yoga, and it will be on the basislaid down by Christianity.”50With the mushrooming of yoga and meditational practices in theWest, such statements have come in for a great deal of criticism. How-ever, such cautions are frequently found in the works of writers on yogacontemporary to Jung both in the East and in the West. Thus Dasguptawrote:If anyone wishes methodically to pursue a course which may leadhim ultimately to the goal aimed at by yoga, he must devote hisentire life to it under the strict practical guidance of an advancedteacher. The present work can in no sense be considered as a prac-tical guide for such purposes....Thephilosophical, psychological,cosmological, ethical, and religious doctrines . . . are extremely in-teresting in themselves, and have a definitely assured place in thehistory of the progress of human thought.51Likewise, Eliade wrote:We have no intention of inviting Western scholars to practice yoga(which, by the way, is not so easy as some amateurs are wont tosuggest) or of proposing that the various Western disciplines prac-tice yogic methods or adopt the yogic ideology. Another pointof view seems to us far more fertile—to study, as attentively aspossible, the results obtained by such means of exploring thepsyche.5248Jung,Modern Psychology3,17.49Ibid.,71.50Jung, “Yoga and the West,” inCW, vol.11, §876.51Dasgupta,Yoga as Philosophy and Religion,vii.52Eliade,Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, xvii.xxx"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONKeyserling was also critical of the adoption of yoga practices in the West:It is very significant that the Indian breathing exercises, which havebeen popularized by Swami Vivekananda through his lectures inAmerica, have not helped a single American to a higher condition,but, on the other hand, are reported to have brought all the moreinto hospitals and lunatic asylums....Ithasnotbeen proved, evenof the most harmless exercises,...thattheyareappropriate to theorganism of the European.53Jung’s conclusion that something analogous to yoga would arise on thebasis of Christianity was also close to Keyserling’s view on the Christianbasis of Western psychology:The Indian concepts are alien to us Westerners; most people areincapable—it is just the theosophists who prove this—of acquiringan inner relation to them. Moreover, physiologically we are allChristians, whether our consciousness recognizes this or not. Thusevery doctrine which continues in the Christian spirit has a betterchance of taking hold of our innermost being than the profoundestdoctrine of foreign origin.54WILHELM HAUER55Wilhelm Hauer was born in Württemberg in1881, six years after Jung.He had a Protestant theological education and was sent in1906by theBasel Mission to India. Like Richard Wilhelm, Hauer was more im-pressed by the spirituality he met than by that which he brought withhim. He later recalled:53Keyserling,The Travel Diary of a Philosopher,276.

I went to India as amissionary in the ordinary sense, but I came back from India amissionary in a different sense. I learned that we have only theright to state, to testify to what is in us, and not expect others tobe converted to our point of view, much less to try to convertthem.56Together with his pastorate, Hauer undertook studies in comparativereligion. This included a spell at the University of Oxford. In1921heabandoned the former and took up a post as a university lecturer atTübingen. In1927he became a professor of Indian studies and com-parative religion and published widely on these topics. It was Hauer’stalk “Der Yoga im Lichte der Psychotherapie” (Yoga in the light of psy-chotherapy) that drew the attention of Jung. Hauer commenced bystating:I know possibly enough about it to recognize that yoga, seen as awhole, is a striking parallel to Western psychotherapy (althoughfundamental differences lie there) but—this I noticed soon—I lackthe detailed knowledge and, above all, the crucial experiment tocompare the individual parts of yoga with the different orientationsof Western psychotherapy with its special methods.57In the remainder of his talk he gave a factual account of yoga and left thecomparison between the two to his audience. Hauer presented himselfas an Indologist seeking psychotherapists with whom he could have adialogue concerning the similarities and differences between yoga andpsychotherapy. It was Jung who took up the invitation.Opinions concerning Hauer vary considerably among scholars. Zim-mer recalled:My personal contact with Jung started in1932. At that time, anotherIndic scholar, most unreliable as a scholar and as a character as well,but endowed with a demoniac, erratic vitality made up of primitiveresistances and ambitions, drew the attention of doctor-psychiatrist-psychologists to the subject of yoga. Now, after his long collabora-tion with Richard Wilhelm on Chinese wisdom, Jung was ready to56The World’s Religions against War.

Hauer had a seminary[sic] on Kundaliniyoga at Zuerich, and I introduced myself at thisforum with a lecture on the types of yoga in Indian tradition, in thespring of1932.58By contrast, Feuerstein stated that “J. W. Hauer . . . to whom we owe agreat deal in the study of yoga and Samkhya . . . not only possessed a richknowledge of Indian thought, but was also well acquainted with Westernculture. . . The central theme of all his works is man as a religious being,and Hauer himself was a sincere god-seeker and mystic.”59C. A. Meierdescribed Hauer as a “typically dry German scientist,” “an excellent San-skritist,” and a “very nice chap.”60THE GENESIS OF THE KUNDALINI SEMINARSAccording to Barbara Hannah,It was in the autumn of1932that the Indologue, J. W. Hauer, at thattime a professor of his subject in Tübingen, came to Zurich to giveus a seminar on Kundalini yoga. This was a thrillingly interestingparallel to the process of individuation, but, as always happens whena perfected Indian philosophy is placed before a European audi-ence, we all got terribly out of ourselves and confused. We wereused to the unconscious taking us into this process very gradually,every dream revealing a little more of the process, but the East hasbeen working at such meditation techniques for many centuries andhas therefore collected far more symbols than we were able to di-gest. Moreover, the East is too far above everyday reality for us, aim-ing at Nirvana instead of at our present, three-dimensional life. Jungwas confronted with a very disorientated group who had greatly ap-preciated but been unable to digest Hauer’s brilliant exposition ofKundalini yoga. When this was over, therefore, Jung devoted thefirst three lectures of his English seminar to a psychological com-58Zimmer, “Some Biographical Remarks about Henry R.

This ac-count has been uncritically followed by subsequent commentators.62Bycontrast, Meier, who was also present, stated that while Hannah mighthave found Hauer’s seminars confusing he found them perfectly clear,and added that there was no general confusion.63He also stated thatJung’s psychological commentary was from the outset part of a plannedcollaboration. Hauer, as the specialist, was to present a scholarly philo-logical and historical account to provide the root support for Jung’s psy-chological interpretation.64Further evidence that Jung’s seminar was by no means simply a spon-taneous improvisation is given by the fact that in both1930and1931hepresented lectures on Kundalini yoga and the symbolism of the cakras.65The first of these appears to be Jung’s first public presentation of thesubject (see appendix1).

It also indicates that the attendance at Jung’s English-lan-guage seminars had fallen off because of the American economic crisisand that the dual-language format was used to maximize the fee. Duringthe summer Jung wrote to Hauer:The rumour about your seminar is already creating a stir. Zimmer,in Heidelberg, has asked me if he could come. Since I know himpersonally, I have agreed. However, Spiegelberg of Hellerau, hasalso asked me and has used your name as a reference.

In1930Jung had presented a Germanseminar on6–11October and similarly in1931he presented a Germanseminar on5–10October. Hence Hauer’s lectures followed these in for-mat and timing.Following Emma Jung’s invitation, Hauer stayed at Jung’s house dur-ing the lectures.79Meier stated that Hauer’s German seminar took placefrom10:00 A.M. to noon with a tea break. Reichstein stated that betweenthirty and forty people attended Hauer’s lectures and that between fortyand eighty attended Jung’s seminar, and that it was often difficult to geta seat for the latter. He recalled that it was difficult to attend Jung’s sem-inars for many of those present wanted to preserve an exclusive atmo-sphere and prevent others from attending. Consequently, Reichstein(who won the Nobel prize for chemistry) went directly to Jung, who gavehim permission to attend.80After each lecture, Jung, Hauer, and ToniWolff had lunch together.81Mrs. Hauer had painted enlarged copies ofthe illustrations of the cakras fromThe Serpent Power, which were used forthe lectures.82Hauer’s German and English lectures covered the same ground. Thelatter were shortened versions of the former. In his English lectures heomitted his own German translation of theûa°-cakra-nirÖpaõa, which hepresented in his German lectures.While the lectures were in progress Jung’s ongoing seminar on visionswas suspended. Jung also presented a synoptic illustrated lecture entitled“Western Parallels to Tantric Symbols” on the evening of7October.83HAUER’S LECTURESHauer commenced with a historical overview of yoga and an explanationof his overall approach. He defined yoga as follows: “Yoga means to graspthe real essence, the inner structure of a matter, in its living reality as a79Letters of Emma Jung to Hauer, cited in Dierks,Jakob Wilhelm Hauer,1881–1962,283.80Reichstein, interview with the editor.81Meier, interview with the editor.82Meier donated these to the Jung Institute when it was founded, and they remain there(interview with the editor).

The danger to people who deal with the cakras fromwithout is that they remain in the region of these psychic processes. . . and the real change in the inmost structure of their being wouldnot take place.88For Hauer this presented the main difficulty lying in the way of gainingan understanding of Kundalini yoga. He argued that the way to over-come this was through grasping it on the basis of one’s own inner experi-ence: “I understand an inner reality only in so far as I have it within my-self and am able to look at this reality that has come up into my consciousfrom the depth of my subconscious; or if it has come from without, itmust have become absolutely living in my own conscious.”89Hence hestated: “I freed myself to a great extent in the beginning from the Indianway of looking at things. I find that I do not reach the inner meaning ifI do not look at them in my own way, from my own point of view.”90Therest of Hauer’s lectures were taken up with an explication of the meta-physics that underlay Kundalini yoga and the symbolism of the cakras.Meier recalled that the tone of Hauer’s German lectures was dry andthere was little time for dialogue except in the tea breaks. By contrast,Jung’s seminars came alive.91Reichstein stated that Hauer was a fanaticand that there was no real discussion, for he was “so persuaded of his86Ibid.,14.85Ibid.,8.84Hauer,HS,1.87Ibid.,13.

I think this seminar is still the last word that has ever been saidabout the deeper psychological meanings of yoga practice.”93News ofthe lectures spread far. Shortly afterward, Hans Trüb wrote to MartinBuber that “I would like to speak to you of Hauer’s seminar. Overall itwas for me inspiring as anticipated. The ‘purusa’-atman was for me acomplete new revelation—above all, the very foreign way (Kundaliniyoga) to it for us.”94Hauer’s method seemed to have influenced Jung’s. In his seminarsJung attempted to lead the participants to an understanding of Kunda-lini yoga on the basis of their own inner experience, namely, the processof individuation. Consequently the account of Kundalini yoga withwhich they were presented was triply filtered—first through Woodroffe’stranslations and commentaries, then through Hauer’s, and finallythrough Jung’s. Not surprisingly, the three were often at variance, bothin their terminology and in their understanding of the processes in-volved. Hence a good deal of the questions from the floor queried thesedifferences.It is important to note that for those who attended Jung’s seminars,they were not simply a course in hermeneutics but engendered particu-lar experiences. Thus Reichstein recalled having dreams that depictedthe movement of the Kundalini serpent during and after the seminars,and that “at least a few” others had similar experiences.95PSYCHOLOGY AND YOGA:PROBLEMS OFCOMPARISON AND COLLABORATIONShortly after his lectures, Hauer wrote to Jung: “The week in Zurich hasprovided me with much stimulation and perhaps I may entertain thehope that the threads of our co-operation have been tightened a little as92Reichstein, interview with the editor.93Frederic Spiegelberg interview, Jung Oral History Archive, Countway Library of Medi-cine, Harvard Medical School, Boston,1–2.94Hans Trüb to Martin Buber,27November1932, Buber Archive, Hebrew University ofJerusalem; my translation.95Reichstein, interview with the editor.xl"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONwell.”96The feeling seems to have been reciprocal, for Jung replied, “Iwould like to extend our collaboration in a special way,” and invited himto participate in an interdisciplinary journal that Daniel Brody of RheinVerlag had proposed to him.97The following year Hauer founded the German Faith Movement. In hisworkGermanic Vision of God, Hauer proclaimed the advent of a specificallyGerman (or Indo-Germanic) religion that would provide a liberationfrom the “alien” Semitic spirit of Christianity. Hauer stated: “The newphase of the German Faith Movement which began with the meeting inEisenach in July1933, must be understood in close relation with the na-tional movement which led to the foundation of the Third Reich. Like thelatter, the German Faith Movement is an eruption from the biological andspiritual depths of the German nation.”98He unsuccessfully attemptedto have it recognized as the official religion of National Socialism.In1935Hauer contributed an essay entitled “Die indo-arische Lehrevom Selbste im Vergleich mit Kants Lehre vom intelligiblen Subject”(The Indo-Aryan teaching on the self in comparison with Kant’s teach-ing on the intelligible subject) to the Festschrift volume for Jung’s sixtiethbirthday.99In his1936essay “Wotan” Jung took Hauer and the German FaithMovement as exemplars of his thesis that the political events in Germanycould be psychologically explained as stemming from the renewed activ-ity of the old Germanic god Wotan.100In1938Hauer again presented a series of lectures at the Psychologi-cal Club in Zurich between7and12March, on “Der Quellgrund desGlaubens und die religiöse Gestaltwerdung” (The basic source of faithand the development of religious forms). Meier recalled that Hauer lec-tured on “the symbolic meaning of the flag (svastika), which met withextremely severe criticism and opposition.”101Their divergent views of96Hauer to Jung,11November1932,inETH; translated by Katherina Rowold.97Jung to Hauer,14November1932,Jung: Letters, vol.1,103.

He said Hauer was one of thevery few scholars in Germany sympathetic with the Nazi regime whichScholem said, ‘I don’t have anything against.’ ”103Hauer carried on his half of his dialogue with Jung on the comparisonbetween yoga and psychotherapy in his subsequent publications. InDerYoga: Ein Indischer Weg zum Selbst104(Yoga: an Indian way to the self) hecommenced by posing questions that have subsequently increased inpertinence with the advent of the new age movement and the popularityof alternative religions:This problem, whether and to what extent this Eastern “way to salva-tion” is also of value for Western people, remains in a state of flux,and has engaged me very seriously. Was it not a mistake or even adanger when for one’s own “way of salvation” men of the West strug-gled with yoga? Why did these men not adhere to scientific re-search, philosophical reflections in the Western manner, life anddeed, as the only ways to “salvation”? Did the West itself not alsohave in its mysticism a way to the inner, that was of better use to itthan yoga? Why were the developing depth psychology and psycho-therapy not enough for it? Did we actually need a new impulse fromthe East? These problems stem from the lectures and study seminarsin C. G. Jung’s “Psychological Club.”105In his view Jung’s analytical psychology had become a method and hencehad succumbed to the dangers of the psychotechnical externalizationthat had been a danger for yoga.106InDer Yogahe devoted a chapter toa critique of Jung’s work. He wrote: “I myself stand critically opposed tothe hypothesis of native and inherited ‘Archetypes.’ To say above all thatthe historico-religious empirical basis for the thesis of the ‘archetypes’ isextremely weak.”107He had also come to a negative judgment on Jung’s102In his diary entry for8March Hauer wrote: “I am too ‘German’ for these people.”Cited in Dierks,Jakob Wilhelm Hauer,1881–1962,297; my translation.103Mircea Eliade interview, Jung Oral History Archive,11.104Hauer,Der Yoga: Ein Indischer Weg zum Selbst(Leipzig,1958).105Ibid.,5; my translation.

Eliade notedthat “tantric texts are often composed in an ‘intentional language’(sandhv-bhvüv), a secret, dark and ambiguous language in which a stateof consciousness is expressed by an erotic term and the vocabulary ofmythology or cosmology is charged with Hatha-yogic or sexual mean-ings.”109This leads to the situation thata tantric text can be read with a number of keys: liturgical, yogic,tantric, etc....Toreadatext with the “yogic key” is to decipher thevarious stages of meditation to which it refers. The tantric meaningis usually erotic, but it is difficult to decide whether the reference isto a concrete act or to a sexual symbolism. More precisely, it is adelicate problem to distinguish between the “concrete” and the“symbolic,” tantricsvdhanahaving as its goal precisely the transub-stantiation of every “concrete” experience, the transformation ofphysiology into liturgy.110Subsequent evaluations of Jung’s psychological interpretations haveturned upon whether one can regard it as a valid additional “key.” Theyhave been criticized by both scholars and adepts of Kundalini yoga. Ha-rold Coward concluded:With today’s much better knowledge of Eastern thought, it is doubt-ful that Jung’s “rope trick” of standing Kundalini yoga on its headand then lopping off the last two cakras as “superfluous speculationswith no practical value” would be accepted. What Jung’s “Commen-tary” accomplished then, and still does today, is to provide addedinsight intohisunderstanding of theprocess of Individuation,notanaccurate description of Kundalini.111108Ibid.,421; my translation.109Eliade,Yoga: Immortality and Freedom,249.110Ibid.,252.

However, within the context of Jung’s collaboration withHauer, this was the task of the latter; Jung’s aim was to elucidate thepsychological meaning of spontaneous symbolism that resembled that ofKundalini yoga. In this respect, Jung stated in a letter that “the entry ofthe East [into the West] is rather a psychological fact with a long historybehind it. The first signs are found in Meister Eckhart, Leibniz, Kant,Hegel, Schopenhauer, and E. von Hartmann. But it is not at all the ac-tual East we are dealing with but the fact of the collective unconscious,which is omnipresent.”112Thus for Jung, the Western “discovery” of theEast constituted a critical chapter in the “discovery” of the collective un-conscious. Jung’s psychological interpretation is predicated on the as-sumption that Kundalini yoga represented a systemization of inner expe-rience that spontaneously presented itself in the West in a mode thatresembled but was not necessarily identical with the way it did so in theEast. This is borne out by an interchange shortly after the Kundalini sem-inars in the resumption of the seminar on visions:Mrs. Sawyer:But in the cakras we always had the Kundaliniseparate.Dr. Jung:Quite, and in this case they are apparently not separate,but that makes no difference. We must never forget that the Kundal-ini system is a specific Indian production, and we have to deal herewith Western material; so we are probably wise to assume this is forus the real stuff, and not Indian material which has been differenti-ated and made abstract since thousands of years.113rubric of Gadamerian hermeneutics.

By contrast, the clinical picture is thatthe Kundalini energy travels up the legs and the back to the top of the head, then down theface, through the throat, to a terminal point in the abdominal area.”The Kundalini Experi-ence: Psychosis or Transcendence?106.xliv"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONIt would also be a mistake to view Jung’s commentary as consisting in thetranslation of the terms of Kundalini yoga into psychological conceptswhose meaning had already been delimited in advance: for in the courseof translating the terms of Kundalini yoga into those of analytical psy-chology, the latter became altered and extended. At base, the symbolismof the cakras enabled Jung to develop an archetypal regional topographyof the psyche and to provide a narration of the process of individuationin terms of the imaginal transit between these regions.114It also led himto argue that for individual transformation to be possible, it required aconcomitant transformation of ontology, to which his work was oriented.In his major works on Western religious traditions subsequent to his en-counter with Kundalini yoga Jung presented his psychological interpre-tations of alchemy and Christianity.115In these his studies on yoga servedas a vital orientation, both in his mode of understanding the practices ofthe alchemists—as evidenced by his stating that “every profound studentof alchemy knows that the making of gold was not the real purpose andthat the process was a Western form of yoga”116—and in his view of al-chemy with its valuation of the body and the feminine—concerns thatare preeminent in tantrism as representing the countercurrent to ortho-dox Christianity.From the experiential viewpoint Gopi Krishna criticized Jung’s exposi-tion:C. G. Jung, in his commentary on the book [The Secret of the GoldenFlower], entirely preoccupied with his own theories about the un-conscious, despite the unambiguous nature of the statements in thework, finds in it only material for the corroboration of his own ideas,and nothing beyond that. The same thing happened in a seminarheld by him on Kundalini, of which a written summary is availablein the Jung Institute. None of the scholars present, as evident fromthe views expressed by them, displayed the least knowledge aboutthe real significance of the ancient document they were discussingat the time.117114On the issue of archetypal topography, see Edward Casey, “Toward an ArchetypalImagination,”Spring: An Annual for Archetypal Psychology and Jungian Thought(1974):1–33;and Peter Bishop, “Archetypal Topography: The Karma-Kargyuda Lineage Tree,” ibid.(1981):67–76.115Jung,CW, vols.11–14.116Jung,Modern Psychology3,107.117Gopi Krishna,Kundalini for the New Age,43.

However, the problems that confront Jung’s interpretations at amore general level apply to other attempts to translate the terms of Kun-dalini yoga into modern concepts.118In the course of such attempts theterms became hybridized, and the resultant blend is no longer distinctly“Eastern” or “Western.”119Ultimately, Jung’s seminars should be as-sessed in terms of the goal he set forward in the following statements:Western consciousness is by no means consciousness in general. Itis rather a historically conditioned and geographically confined di-mension, which represents only a part of mankind.120The knowledge of Eastern psychology namely forms the indispens-able basis for a critique and an objective consideration of Westernpsychology.121Thus in Jung’s view the outcome of Western psychology’s encounterwith Eastern thought was by no means a small matter, for on this the verypossibility of a psychology worthy of the name rested.122The continuedrelevance of this seminar today—in a vastly transformed historicalclime—principally lies in the mode in which it highlights this capitalquestion and attempts to establish it at the forefront of the psychologicalagenda, whether or not one accepts Jung’s provisional solutions to it.S.S.118Such as Gopi Krishna’s own theoretical attempts to transcribe it in contemporarypost-Darwinian categories, as in the following statement: “In the language of science, Kun-dalini represents the mechanism of evolution in human beings.” Gopi Krishna,Kundalinifor the New Age,87.119On the contemporary significance of the notion of hybridity within the postcolonialcontext, see Homi Bhabha,The Location of Culture(London,1993).120Jung, “Commentary on the ‘Secret of the Golden Flower’ ,” inCW, vol.13, §84; trans-lation modified.121Jung, “Foreword to Abegg: ‘Ostasien Denkt Anders’ ” (East Asia thinks otherwise), inCW, vol.18, §1483; translation modified.122On the encounter of Western psychology and Eastern thought, see Eugene Taylor,“Contemporary Interest in Classical Eastern Psychology,” inAsian Contributions to Psychology,edited by A.

One ring wassmaller and was encircled by the larger ring. Within the small ring lay a male child asthough in the womb.’ (That is, in the centre.) ‘It was surrounded by amniotic fluid.

So thekleçathat contains the germ of personality canbe called just as well thekleçaof individuation, because what we call per-sonality is an aspect of individuation. Even if you don’t become a com-plete realization of yourself, you become at least a person; you have acertain conscious form. Of course, it is not a totality; it is only a part,perhaps, and your true individuality is still behind the screen—yet whatis manifested on the surface is surely a unit. One is not necessarily con-scious of the totality, and perhaps other people see more clearly who youare than you do yourself. So individuality is always. It is everywhere. Ev-erything that has life is individual—a dog, a plant, everything living—butof course it is far from being conscious of its individuality. A dog hasprobably an exceedingly limited idea of himself as compared with thesum total of his individuality. As most people, no matter how much theythink of themselves, are egos, yet at the same time they are individuals,almost as if they were individuated. For they are in a way individuatedfrom the very beginning of their lives, yet they are not conscious of it.Individuation only takes place when you are conscious of it, but individu-ality is always there from the beginning of your existence.Mrs. Baynes:I did not get where the hate,dveüa, came in.Dr. Jung:Hatred is the thing that divides, the force which discrimi-nates. It is so when two people fall in love; they are at first almost identi-cal. There is a great deal ofparticipation mystique, so they need hatred inorder to separate themselves. After a while the whole thing turns into awild hatred; they get resistances against one another in order to forceeach other off—otherwise they remain in a common unconsciousnesswhich they simply cannot stand. One sees that also in analysis. In the caseof an exaggerated transference, after a while there are correspondingresistances. This too is a certain hatred.The old Greek putphobos, fear, instead of hatred. They said that thefirstborn thing was either Eros orphobos; some say Eros and othersphobos,according to their temperaments. There are optimists who say the realthing is love, and pessimists who say the real thing isphobos.Phobossepa-rates more than hatred, because fear causes one to run away, to removeoneself from the place of danger.I was once asked a philosophical question by a Hindu: “Does a manwho loves God need more or fewer incarnations to reach his final salva-tion than a man who hates God?” Now, what would you answer? I gave itup naturally. And he said: “A man who loves God will need seven incar-nations to become perfect, and a man who hates God only three, be-cause he certainly will think of him and cling to him very much more5"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"LECTURE 1than the man who loves God.” That, in a way, is true; hatred is a tremen-dous cement. So for us the Greek formulationphobosis perhaps betterthan hatred as the principle of separation. There has been, and is still,moreparticipation mystiquein India than in Greece, and the West has cer-tainly a more discriminating mind than the East. Therefore, as our civili-zation largely depends upon the Greek genius, with us it would be fearand not hatred.Mrs. Crowley:Yet in the cakras apparently the most important gestureis that of dispelling fear.Dr. Jung:Yes, but the gods are always carrying weapons also, and weap-ons are not an expression of any particular love.Miss Wolff:I have my notes here, and I think I see what caused Mrs.Bailward’s confusion. Professor Hauer said in GermanhasserfüllteZweiung, but it does not mean to become two, exactly; it means to be-come a subject against an object—there are two things.6The Englishtranslation is not so clear.Dr. Jung: Entzweiungmeans separation. Now the rest of the question?Mrs. Bailward:I mean, would the yogi consider the state of hatred anecessary condition in building up individuality?Dr. Jung:Yes, he cannot help considering it so, for the whole yoga pro-cess, whether classical or Kundalini yoga, naturally has a tendency tomake the individual one, even as the god is one, like brahman, an exist-ing nonexisting oneness.The question continues: “And when it had built up the individuality,how would hatred be torn out by the roots?”Miss Wolff:Professor Hauer spoke of the two aspects of thekleça.7Inthe imperfect condition—thesthÖlaaspect—the urge to be a subjectover against an object is mingled with hatred. But in thesÖkümaaspectthe same urge is the power to become a personality.Dr. Jung:Yes, it is an important and very bewildering thing in thiswhole terminology that one always must make the distinction betweenthesthÖlaandsÖkümaaspects.8I do not speak of theparvaspect because6See n.4.7Hauer stated: “Thekleçaare incittain two forms or aspects, thesthÖla, meaning therough coarse aspect . . . and thesÖküma, or subtle aspect” (HS,37), and “the subtle orsÖkümaaspect ofdveüais the power to be a separate personality; that is the metapsychicforce that creates or makes possible the personality. But thesthÖlaaspect is the one weexperience in ordinary life, that is mixed with hatred” (ibid.,38).8Hauer stated that according to tantric yoga, there were three aspects of reality—sthÖla,sÖküma,andparv: “ThesthÖlaaspect means reality as it appears to our senses. . . . Behindthis, or working as the dynamic force within thissthÖlaaspect, we have thesÖkümaaspect,which, literally translated, means the subtle, fine aspect” (ibid.,26). He defined theparv6"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"12 OCTOBER 1932that is what Professor Hauer calls the metaphysical. I must confess thatthere the mist begins for me—I do not risk myself there. ThesthÖlaas-pect is simply things as we see them. ThesÖkümaaspect is what we guessabout them, or the abstractions or philosophical conclusions we drawfrom observed facts. When we see people who make efforts to consoli-date themselves, to be egos, and therefore resist and hate one another,we see thesthÖlaaspect, and we are only aware of thekleçaof hatred,calleddveüa. But if we go a step higher, we suddenly understand that thisfoolish kind of hatred, all these personal resistances, are merely externalaspects of very important and profound things.To quote a practical case: when a person complains that he is alwayson bad terms with his wife or the people whom he loves, and that thereare terrible scenes or resistances between them, you will see when youanalyze this person that he has an attack of hatred. He has been living inparticipation mystiquewith those he loves. He has spread himself overother people until he has become identical with them, which is a viola-tion of the principle of individuality. Then they have resistances natu-rally, in order to keep themselves apart. I say:Of course, it is most regrettable that you always get into trouble, butdon’t you see what you are doing? You love somebody, you identifywith them, and of course you prevail against the objects of your loveand repress them by your very self-evident identity. You handlethem as if they were yourself, and naturally there will be resistances.It is a violation of the individuality of those people, and it is a sinagainst your own individuality. Those resistances are a most usefuland important instinct: you have resistances, scenes, and disap-pointments so that you may become finally conscious of yourself,andthenhatredisnomore.ThatisthesÖkümaaspect.If a person thoroughly understands this, he will agree and not worry.In other words, he knows when he loves that soon he will hate. Thereforehe will laugh when he is going uphill and weep when he is going down-hill, like Till Eulenspiegel.9He will realize the paradox of life—that heaspect as “the causes and the real character of those centres of energy. For beyond thosedynamic forces of the subtle kind . . . there is a power which can no longer be conceived inmere terms of cosmic energies. . . . There we get into the religious sphere, which is con-nected with the godhead as it is in its inner nature” (ibid.,26–27).9This was an analogy that Jung used on several occasions; cf.CW, vol.7, §47; andNietz-sche’s “Zarathustra”: Notes of the Seminar Given in1934–1939, edited by James Jarrett (Prince-ton, Bollingen Series XCIX, and London,1988), vol.1,226. The editors of Jung’s letters7"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"LECTURE 1cannot be perfect, and he cannot always be one with himself. It is ouridea to be one, to have absolutely clear situations in life. But it is all im-possible—it is all too one-sided, and we are not one-sided. You see, theanalytical process tears up hatred by the roots by explaining thesÖkümaaspect, namely, the aspect on the level of understanding, of abstraction,theory, wisdom. And so we learn that what is a regrettable habit, for in-stance, or impossible moods or inexplicable disagreements in thesthÖlaaspect, is something quite different in thesÖkümaaspect.Then a second question: “Is there a psychological equivalent to thetattva,10and thesaôskvra?”11Well, thetattva, being the essence ofthings, is psychologically again asÖkümaaspect of things. The termlibido,or energy, is a good example of atattva. It is not a substance but an ab-straction. Energy is not to be observed in nature; it does not exist. Whatexists in nature is natural force, like a waterfall, or a light, or a fire, or achemical process. There we apply the termenergy, but energy in itselfdoes not exist, despite the fact that you can buy it at the electrical works.But that is merely a metaphorical energy. Energy proper is an abstrac-tion of a physical force, a certain amount of intensity. It is a concept ofthe natural forces in theirsÖkümaaspect, where they are no longer man-ifestations buttattva, essence, abstraction. You see the Eastern mind isconcretistic—when it arrives at a conclusion or builds up an abstraction,the latter is already a substance; it is almost visible or audible—one canalmost touch it. Whereas with us this process is rather spurious, as whena concept like energy becomes fairly well known, so that any workmanspeaks of it. Then naturally people assume that this energy must besomething one can put into a bottle—one can buy it and sell it, so it mustbe something tangible. There that concretistic quality of the Easternmind comes in with us. For in reality energy is not substantial: it is aconformity of things, say, or the intensity of various physical or materialprocesses. In the East, when anybody speaks oftattva, they conceive of itprovide the following note: “A popular figure in German folklore, representing the superi-ority of the wily peasant over the town dwellers and tradesmen. The first collection ofhis jests and practical jokes was published in1515. In one story Till Eulenspiegel, unlikehis companions, rejoices when walking uphill in anticipation of the coming descent.”C. G. Jung: Letters, vol.2,603.10Hauer translatedtattva“literally as thatness, or in GermanDasheit. Thatness meansthat hidden power in the whole universe which has a certain tendency to create and movein a specific way—that and that” (HS,31).11Hauer translatedsaôskvraas “the maker who makes things so that they are really aworking compound, a working whole” (HS,41). He commented: “At this moment, what wethink, how we sit, how we talk, is all caused bysaôskvra. If we think we are now talkingfreely, if we experience it as that in our consciousness . . . that is illusion” (ibid.,42).8"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"12 OCTOBER 1932as already in existence, and, mind you, a complete existence—as if atattvareally could become visible to them. I don’t know whether anybodyhas had a vision oftattva, but that might be, for they can visualize anyconcept, no matter how abstract. So thetattva, which is a concrete thingin the East, has with us asÖkümaaspect—it is an abstraction, an idea. Theconcept of energy is a very suitable example, but there are of courseother ideas of the sort, such as the principles of gravity, or the idea of anatom, or of electrons—these are the equivalents oftattvas. In psychology,as I say, it would be libido, which is also a concept.Then thesaôskvra, if understood as something concrete, has really noanalogy with us. We are unable to concretize these things. That is anentirely philosophical teaching, which for us has only a certain validityinasmuch as we believe in the migration of souls, reincarnation, or anypre-existing conditions. Our idea of heredity would be similar to the ideaofsaôskvra, as well as our hypothesis of the collective unconscious. Forthe mind in a child is by no meanstabula rasa. The unconscious mind isfull of a rich world of archetypal images. The archetypes are conditions,laws or categories of creative fantasy, and therefore the psychologicalequivalent of thesaôskvra. But mind you, in the Eastern mind the doc-trine of thesaôskvrais so different from that definition that perhaps aHindu would object to my attempt at a comparison. But the archetypalimages are really the nearest thing we can see.Dr. Reichstein:I want to ask about thesthÖlaaspect. I thoughtsthÖlawasthe more physical aspect, andsÖkümamore the psychological, not onlythe abstract, aspect. For it cannot be perceived by intellect only; it is apeculiar kind of being connected with things.Dr. Jung:You are quite right, but the psychological aspect of thingsimplies also a philosophy about them. For instance, take the psychologi-cal aspect of a chair: it has both asthÖlaand asÖkümaaspect. It is a phys-ical phenomenon and as such it is obvious in itssthÖlaaspect. But in itssÖkümaaspect it is not so obvious—thesÖkümaaspect is the idea. As in thePlatonic teaching of theeidolon,theeidosofathingisthesÖkümaaspect.But in Plato we can still see concretizations: he says that all things arederivatives, or incomplete imitations of theeidolathat are conserved in asort of heavenly storehouse, in which are the models of every existingthing. So all the forms of our empirical world would derive from theseeidola. This idea is thesÖkümaaspect, or you can say the psychology ofthings. But for us, the Platonic ideas, which Plato understood to be reallyexisting, are psychological concepts, or even mere illusions or assump-tions. For even if we assume that there is such a heavenly storehousewhere models of things really do exist, we are not a bit sure of it; thinking9"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"LECTURE 1like that does not produce the thing. If the primitive mind thinks a thing,itis. A dream, for instance, is to them as real as this chair. They must bevery careful not to think certain things, as the thought easily might be-come reality. We are still like that—we say a mouthful, and at the sametime we touch wood.Mrs. Diebold:Would thesÖkümaaspect correspond to Kant’s thing initself [das Ding an sich]?Dr. Jung:Yes, as would also his use of the termnoumenon.Thenou-menonis the idea, the spiritual essence of a thing. You see, Kant wasalready a very critical man, and in hisCritique of Pure Reason12he says thatthe thing in itself,das Ding an sich, is a purely negative borderline con-cept, which does not guarantee that such a thing exists at all. He simplymakes such a concept to express the fact that behind the world of phe-nomena, there is something about which we can say nothing. Yet in hispsychological lectures he spoke of a plurality ofnoumena—that there aremany things in themselves—which is a contradiction of hisCritique ofPure Reason.13Mrs. Crowley:Is that not really an archetype?Dr. Jung:Yes, theeidosin Plato is of course the archetype. The termarchetype comes from St. Augustine, who used it in that Platonic sense.He was in that respect a neoplatonist, like so many other philosophers inthose days. But with them it was not a psychological concept; the ideaswere concretized—that means hypostatized, which is a very good word.You see, hypostasis is not a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an assumption Imake, an idea I have formed, in order to attempt an explanation of facts.But I know all the time that I have only assumed it, and that my idea stillneeds proof. Hypothesis means to put something which isn’t thereunder something;Unterstellungis the German term for it. There is noEnglish term, as far as I am aware, with exactly that sense. It might be anassumption, or it could also have an unfavorable nuance of insinuation.Now, hypostasis means that there is something below whichissubstan-tial, upon which something else rests.Mr. Dell:From what root does hypostasis come?12Immanuel Kant,Critique of Pure Reason,2d ed., translated by Norman Kemp Smith(London,1929), 266ff.13In his1898lecture before the Zofingia Society, “Thoughts on Speculative Inquiry,”Jung critiqued Kant’s concept of theDing an sich, arguing against Kant’s rigid distinctionbetween the knowable, phenomenal realm and the unknowable noumenal realm, argu-ing that science progressively made the noumenal known.Zofingia Lectures,inCWA,§§195–99. He also commented on Kant’s lectures on psychology (Vorlesungen über Psycholo-gie[Leipzig,1889]) in “The Relations between the Ego and the Unconscious,” inCW7,§260,note7.10"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"12 OCTOBER 1932Dr. Jung: Histemiis the Greek verb, to be standing, andhypomeansbelow. The same root is in the Greek wordikonostasis, which, in theGreek Orthodox church, is the background behind the altar where thestatues of the saints stand. The image or picture of a saint is called anikon,andikonostasisis the place upon which it stands, usually a pedestal,or a wall upon which are placed such images or pictures. To make ahypostasis means to invent a subject which is hanging in the air. It has nobasis, but you assume that it has, and say it is a real thing. For instance,you invent the idea of atattvaand say it is by no means a mere word, abreath of air with nothing underneath it. You saytattvais an essence; itis something substantial—something is standing underneath that holdsit up. A hypostasis contains always the assumption that a thing really is,and the natural primitive mind is always hypostatizing. In our better mo-ments, when we are a bit superstitious, we also have hypostases.Mr. Dell:The hypostasis of gravity makes the apple fall.Dr. Jung:Yes, you assume the thing is, and that makes the apple fall.Or, for instance, Kant says, in his famous discussion of the assumption ofGod, that “God is, God is not”—that when anybody says God is, he justsays so, but his saying so does not mean that he is. He can say God is, butperhaps he is not. But when you hypostatize, then by saying God is, youassume that God really exists. You have made God, so that he is in reality.One can bring about most unfortunate situations by simply declaringthat a thing is so. That is what the animus does and what one alwaysobjects to in the animus. “Oh, I thought . . .”—and then the house burnsdown because you thought you had put the fire out. But unfortunatelythe house has burned down.Mrs. Baynes:Don’t all heuristic principles tend to run into hypostases?Dr. Jung:They run a risk, sure enough. As soon as a hypothesis hasgiven evidence of its applicability, it tends to become a truth, to becomea hypostasis—and we forget entirely that it is only a hypothesis, an inten-tional, arbitrary theory on our part.Dr. Kranefeldt:The sexual theory of Freud could be called a hypothesis,which then became a hypostasis.Dr. Jung:Exactly: it proves its evidence by a certain amount of facts,and then one assumes it must be a truth. Well now, this is merely aboutconcepts, and in tantric yoga there were things which needed furtherexplanation from the psychological side.Mrs. Sawyer:When Professor Hauer spoke of the cakras, he called onlythe picture inside each a mandala. Could we not call the total cakra amandala?Dr. Jung:Yes, the cakras are also occasionally called mandalas. Naturally11"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"LECTURE 1Professor Hauer does not attach such a technical meaning to the man-dala as we do. He called the total picturepadma, the lotus, or cakra.14Mandala means ring, or circle. It can be a magic circle, for example, or itcan be a cycle. There are Vedicsutrasin which the series of chaptersmakes a cycle that is called a mandala; for instance, the third mandala,chapter10, verse15—the mandala is simply the name of the cycle.Mrs. Sawyer:But he called a square a mandala.15Dr. Jung:Yes, he calls that a mandala, and naturally anything within isa mandala too, and this is exactly what you see in the Lamaistic pic-tures:16the mandala, the lotus, is inside, as well as the temple, and thecloister with the square walls, the whole surrounded by the magic circle;then above are the gods, and mountains below. The term mandala withus has taken on an importance which it does not possess in India, whereit is merely one of the Yantras,17an instrument of worship in the Lamais-tic cult and in tantric yoga. And mind you, the tantric school is littleknown in India—you could ask millions of Hindus, and they would nothave the faintest idea of what it was. It would be as if you asked the hon-orable citizens of Zurich what they had to tell you of scholasticism; theywould know about as much as the Hindu knows about tantric yoga. Andif you asked a Hindu what a mandala was, he would say that a roundtable, or anything circular, was a mandala. But to us it is a specific term.Even within the frame of the tantric school the mandala has not the im-portance that it has with us. Our idea of it would come nearest to La-maism, the Tibetan religion, but this is hardly known, and its textbookshave been translated only very recently, hardly ten years ago. One of thefundamental sources is theShrichakrasambhara, a tantric text translatedby Sir John Woodroffe.1814Hauer stated: “Cakra means circle, but it is also calledpadma, meaning lotus-flower”(HS,61).15In his description of themÖlvdhvracakra, Hauer referred to the “square or mandalaof the earth” (HS,71).16[Note to the1932edition: See the frontispiece of theGolden Flower.] Jung and Wil-helm,The Secret of the Golden Flower(London and New York,1931).

Here you touch upon something really most bewilder-ing, for when you try to translate that material into psychological lan-guage, you reach amazing conclusions. Take themÖlvdhvracakra,21which seems very simple. Its psychological location is in the perineum.You assume you know all about it, but psychologically what ismÖlvdhvra?You think of it as that region down below in the abdomen, having to dowith sexuality and all sorts of unsavory things. But that is notmÖlvdhvra;mÖlvdhvrais something quite different. Perhaps we should look at thesecond cakra22first.The ocean with the sea monster is above in the system of the cakras,but in reality we find always that it is below in our psychology—we alwaysdescend into the unconscious. ThereforemÖlvdhvramust be somethingquite different from what we would conclude. Have you ever been inmÖlvdhvra? Some of you could say you have been in the unconscious, inthe ocean, and there you had seen the leviathan. Let us assume that youhave really done the night sea journey, have wrestled with the great mon-ster. That would mean you had been insvadhiü°hana, the second center,the water region. But then, have you been inmÖlvdhvra, too? Here is agreat difficulty. You will probably be puzzled when I tell you my concep-tion ofmÖlvdhvra. You see,mÖlvdhvrais a whole world; each cakra23is awhole world. Perhaps you remember the picture which I showed of apatient, where she was entangled in the roots of a tree, and then abovevolumes from this series, published between1914and1924. Jung provided an extendedcommentary on this text in his Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule lectures in1938–39,inModern Psychology3,42–120.19Hauer described the second cakra,svvdhiü°hvna, as “the life we live freely and thought-lessly, just throwing ourselves into the stream of life and letting ourselves be carried, float-ing on to all that comes to us” (HS,75).20A term by which the Kundalini is described in theûa°-cakra-nirÖpaõa; see appendix4,112.21Hauer describedMul dh raas “the cakra that holds the root of things. It is the regionof the earth, of the creative man and woman power . . . the foundation of the world” (HS,p.68).22The representation of thesvvdhiü°hana cakrashows amakara, a mythological sea mon-ster, on water.

And in which stage is theself asleep and the ego conscious?Here, of course, in this conscious worldwhere we are all reasonable and respectable people, adapted individualsas one says. Everything runs smoothly; we are going to have lunch, wehave appointments, we are perfectly normal citizens of certain states. Weare under certain obligations and cannot run away easily without gettingneurotic; we have to look after our duties. So we are all in the roots, weare upon our root support. (“Root support” is the literal translation ofmÖlvdhvra.) We are in our roots right in this world—when you buy yourticket from the streetcar conductor, for instance, or for the theater, orpay the waiter—that is reality as you touch it. And then the self is asleep,which means that all things concerning the gods are asleep.Now, after this startling statement we have to find out whether such aninterpretation is really justifiable. I am by no means sure. I am even con-vinced that Professor Hauer would not agree with me right on the spot.In these matters one needs a great deal of psychology in order to makeit palatable to the Western mind. If we do not try hard and dare to com-mit many errors in assimilating it to our Western mentality, we simply getpoisoned. For these symbols have a terribly clinging tendency. Theycatch the unconscious somehow and cling to us. But they are a foreignbody in our system—corpus alienum—and they inhibit the natural growthand development of our own psychology. It is like a secondary growth ora poison. Therefore one has to make almost heroic attempts to masterthese things, to do something against those symbols in order to deprivethem of their influence. Perhaps you cannot fully realize what I say, buttake it as a hypothesis. It is more than a hypothesis, it is even a truth. Ihave seen too often how dangerous their influence may be.If we assume thatmÖlvdhvra, being the roots, is the earth upon whichwe stand, it necessarily must be our conscious world, because here weare, standing upon this earth, and here are the four corners of this earth.We are in the earth mandala.

It is a place where mankind is a victim of impulses, in-stincts, unconsciousness, ofparticipation mystique, where we are in a darkand unconscious place. We are hapless victims of circumstances, our rea-son practically can do very little. Yes, when times are quiet, if there is noimportant psychological storm, we can do something with the help oftechnique. But then comes a storm, say, a war or a revolution, and thewhole thing is destroyed and we are nowhere.Moreover, when we are in this three-dimensional space, talking senseand doing apparently meaningful things, we are nonindividual—we arejust fish in the sea. Only at times have we an inkling of the next cakra.Something works in certain people on Sunday mornings, or perhaps oneday in the year, say Good Friday—they feel a gentle urge to go to church.Many people instead have an urge to go to the mountains, into nature,where they have another sort of emotion. Now, that is a faint stirring ofthe sleeping beauty; something which is not to be accounted for starts inthe unconscious. Some strange urge underneath forces them to dosomething which is not just the ordinary thing. So we may assume thatthe place where the self, the psychological non-ego, is asleep is the mostbanal place in the world—a railway station, a theater, the family, the pro-fessional situation—there the gods are sleeping; there we are just reason-able, or as unreasonable, as unconscious animals. And this ismÖlvdhvra.If that is so, then the next cakra,svvdhiü°hvna, must be the uncon-scious, symbolized by the sea, and in the sea is a huge leviathan whichthreatens one with annihilation. Moreover, we must remember that menhave made these symbols. Tantric yoga in its old form is surely the workof men, so we can expect a good deal of masculine psychology. There-fore no wonder that in the second cakra is the great half-moon, which isof course a female symbol. Also, the whole thing is in the form of thepadmaor lotus, and the lotus is theyoni.25(Padmais simply the hieraticname, the metaphor for theyoni, the female organ.)Mrs. Sawyer:Professor Hauer said that the crescent was not a femalesymbol; it belonged toåiva.26Dr. Jung:That is so for the East, and if you ask a Hindu about thesethings he would never admit that you could putmÖlvdhvraabovesvvdhiü°hvna.

You see, a Hindu is normal when he is not in thisworld. Therefore if you assimilate these symbols, if you get into theHindu mentality, you are just upside-down, you are all wrong. They havethe unconscious above, we have it below. Everything is just the opposite.The south on all our maps is below, but in the East the south is above andthe north below, and east and west are exchanged. It is quite the otherway around.Now, the second center has all the attributes that characterize the un-conscious. Therefore we may assume that the way out of ourmÖlvdhvraexistence leads into the water. A man I know who is not in analysis hashad interesting dreams representing this quite frequently, and they wereall identical. He found himself moving along a certain road, or a littlestreet or path, either in a vehicle or on foot—the dream always beganwith such a movement—and then, to his great amazement, all theseroads inevitably led into water, the second cakra.Therefore, the very first demand of a mystery cult always has been togo into water, into the baptismal fount. The way into any higher develop-ment leads through water, with the danger of being swallowed by themonster. We would say today that is not the case with the Christian bap-tism—there is no danger in being baptized. But if you study the beautifulmosaic pictures in the Baptistry of the Orthodox in Ravenna (whichdates from the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century, when thebaptism was still a mystery cult), you see four scenes depicted on the wall:two describe the baptism of Christ in the Jordan; and the fourth isSt. Peter drowning in a lake during a storm, and the Saviour is rescuinghim.27Baptism is a symbolical drowning. There are certain sects in Rus-sia that, in order to make it real, put people under the water until theyoccasionally do get drowned. It is a symbolic death out of which newlife comes, a newborn babe. The initiates are often fed with milk after-27Jung provides an account of this experience inMDR,314–18. There he stated thathe had asked an acquaintance who was going to Ravenna to obtain pictures for him, andhis acquaintance learned that the mosaics did not exist (ibid.,315). Aniela Jaffé notedthat Jung explained this as a “momentary new creation by the unconscious, arising out ofhis thoughts about archetypal initiation. The immediate cause of the concretisation lay, inhis opinion, in a projection of his anima upon Galla Placida” (ibid.,316). Jung’s recol-lections inMDRof the mosaics differ somewhat from that given here; these differences arenoted in Dan Noel’s “A Viewpoint on Jung’s Ravenna Vision,”Harvest: Journal for JungianStudies39(1993):159–63, which forms a reappraisal of this whole episode.16"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"12 OCTOBER 1932ward, as in the cult of Attis, where after the baptism people were fed withmilk for eight days as if they were little babies, and they got a newname.28So the symbolism in thesvvdhiü°hvnacakra is the worldwide idea of thebaptism by water with all its dangers of being drowned or devoured bythe makara. Today, instead of the sea or leviathan we say analysis, whichis equally dangerous. One goes under the water, makes the acquaintanceof the leviathan there, and that is either the source of regeneration ordestruction. And if that analogy holds true, then the analogy of the sunmyth must hold true too, for the whole baptismal story is in the sun myth.You see that the sun in the afternoon is getting old and weak, and there-fore he is drowned; he goes down into the Western sea, travels under-neath the waters (the night sea journey), and comes up in the morningreborn in the East. So one would call the second cakra the cakra or man-dala of baptism, or of rebirth, or of destruction—whatever the conse-quence of the baptism may be.We also can say something about the details of this cakra. The fiery redis understandable.mÖlvdhvrais darker, the color of blood, of dark pas-sion. But this vermilion ofsvvdhiü°hvnacontains far more light, and ifyou assume that this has really also something to do with the sun’scourse, it might be the sun’s rays while setting or rising—the color of thedawn or the last rays of the sun are a rather humid kind of red. Thenafter the second center we could expect the manifestation of newbornlife, a manifestation of light, intensity, of high activity, and that would bemaõipÖra.29But before we speak of that center we should exhaust thissecond cakra. It is a peculiar fact that in the East they put these cakrasnot below our feet but above. We would putmÖlvdhvraabove becausethis is our conscious world, and the next cakra would be underneath—that is our feeling, because we really begin above. It is all exchanged; webegin in our conscious world, so we can say ourmÖlvdhvramight be notdown below in the belly but up in the head. You see, that puts everythingupside-down.Mrs. Sawyer:But in the unconscious it is the same.Dr. Jung:Ah, now comes the unconscious whereles extrêmes se touchent.There everything is yea and nay, and theremÖlvdhvrais above as wellas below. We have an analogy in the tantric system of cakras. What is28Jung provided an interpretation of the Attis myth inSymbols of Transformation,inCW,vol.5, §§659–62.29Hauer defined themaõipÖracakra as follows: “Maõimeans the pearl or the jewel, andthepÖrameaning fullness or richness, one might call it the treasure of the pearl, or thetreasure of the jewels” (HS,68).17"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"LECTURE 1the analogy betweenvjñv,30the highest center, andmÖlvdhvra?

Again they are in the creative condition, but in an entirely differ-ent form. As they are united below so they are united above. So the twocenters can be exchanged.You see, in adapting that system to ourselves, we must realize where westand before we can assimilate such a thing. With us it is apparently theother way around; we do not go up to the unconscious, we go down—itis akatabasis. This was always so. The old mystery cults often took placeunderground. One sees that in old Christian churches in the cryptbelow the altar—the underchurch. It is the same idea as the Mithraicspelaeum, which was the cave or the room where the cult of Mithras tookplace. It was always a place under the earth, or it was a real grotto. Thecult of Attis also took place in grottos. The grotto in which Christ wasborn in Bethlehem is said to have been aspelaeum.33Then you remem-ber that St. Peter’s in Rome now stands where thetaurobolia, the bloodbaptisms in the cult of Attis, had taken place before. Also, the highpriests of the cult of Attis had the title Papas, and the pope, who beforewas simply a bishop of Rome, took on that title. Attis himself is a dyingand resurrecting god—showing the continuity of true history.Mr. Baumann:Professor Hauer mentioned that man can go two waysto the unconscious—either to the left or to the right. In one way he facesthe monster and is swallowed by it, and in the other way he comes frombehind and can attack the sea monster.3430Hauer defined thevjñvcakra as meaning “ ‘command’; it is something that one knowsone ought to do, it has to do withErkenntnis, knowledge. . . . You might call it, in English,acknowledgement. It is a command, or an acknowledgement to oneself, as if told thatsomething was one’s duty” (HS,69).31Hauer described thevjñvcakra as follows: “Theyoniand theli ́ga, woman power andman power, are united, they are not apart” (HS,90).32Hauer described themulvdhvracakra as follows: “Here are again theyoniand theli ́ga,and here Kundalini sleeps.

It is quite a different red from that in the heart [vjñv] centrewhere it is the erotic life in the higher sense, where whilst here it is in the real earthly sense”(HS,92).33In “Visions of Zosimos” (1937), Jung noted: “Attis has close affinities with Christ.

So we can reverse the whole thing, asif we were coming down frommÖlvdhvra, as if that were the highest cen-ter. Of course, we can put it like that. But then, we can also say we aregoing up.Mrs. Sawyer:In all the visions we have been dealing with in the Englishseminar, first one goes down and then up.

This is afaçon de parler. We are on the earth or in the earth. That woman entan-gled in the roots is just entangled in her personal life. As a matter of fact,she happens to have been particularly so, and therefore she representedherself as entangled in the duties of life, in her relations with her family,and so on. For her, going to analysis was surely going up. And goingthrough the Christian baptism is going up, but that does not hinder itsbeing represented by going down into the water. Christ doesn’t climb upinto the Jordan.Mrs. Crowley:Don’t you think the Eastern idea of the unconscious isdifferent from ours? It is a different kind of unconscious.Dr. Jung:Yes, they have an entirely different idea, but it is no use dis-cussing what their idea is because we don’t know it.Mrs. Crowley:But you can get it from reading the Sanskrit things—theVedic things.Dr. Jung:I have read a good deal but it is not clear. I know only thatthey see these things very differently. For instance, I had some corre-spondence with a Hindu pundit about the mandala cakras. He informedme that they had to do with medicine, that they were anatomical and hadnothing like a philosophical meaning. Such an idea did not enter hishorizon. He was a man who had read the Sanskrit texts. I don’t know himpersonally; he is a university professor at Dacca.Mrs. Crowley:They are just as divided in their types over there as here.Dr. Jung:Naturally—they have many different views, and the wholeEast has very different views from ours about these matters. They don’trecognize the unconscious, and just as little do they know what we meanby consciousness. Their picture of the world is entirely different fromours, so we can understand it only inasmuch as we try to understand it in19"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"LECTURE 1our own terms. Therefore, I make the attempt to approach the thingfrom the psychological point of view. I am sorry to have bewildered you,but you will be more bewildered if you take these things literally. (Youhad better not.) If you think in those terms, you build up an apparentHindu system with the psychology of the Western mind, and you cannotdo that—you simply poison yourself. So if we deal with it all—and I amafraid we have to because of similar structures in our own unconscious—we must do it in this way. We must realize, or take into consideration atleast, thatmÖlvdhvrais here, the life of this earth, and here the god isasleep. And then you go to thekrater35—to use that old quotation fromZosimos—or to the unconscious, and that is understood to be a highercondition than before, because there you approach another kind of life.And you move there only through the Kundalini that has beenaroused.36Now, here we have to speak of Kundalini and what she is, or how shecan be awakened.37You remember that Professor Hauer said that someinstigation from above arouses Kundalini, and he also said one musthave a purifiedbuddhi,38or a purified spirit, in order to arouse her. Sothe progress into the second cakra is possible only if you have arousedthe serpent, and the serpent can only be aroused by the right attitude.Expressed in psychological terms, that would mean that you can ap-proach the unconscious in only one way, namely, by a purified mind, bya right attitude, and by the grace of heaven, which is the Kundalini.Something in you, an urge in you, must lead you to it. If that does not35In “Visions of Zosimos” Jung wrote of thekrater: “Thekrateris obviously a wonder-working vessel, a font or piscina, in which the immersion takes place and transformationinto a spiritual being is effected.”CW, vol.13, §97.36In the manuscript “Die Beschreibung der beiden Centren Shat-chakra Nirupana,”Jung wrote: “In Mula dhara Kundalini sleeps. It is latent activity, which shows outside.Through it man is bound to the world of appearance and believes that his ego is identicalwith his self. Kundalini is concealed cit (consciousness), and when it awakes it turns backto its master. It is ‘world-consciousness,’ in contrast to civ-atma = individual consciousness”(2; my translation).37Hauer defined the Kundalini as follows: “Kundalini as understood here is not in anyway an erotic power of man, but a form of woman power which is nothing but pure knowl-edge; there is in woman power a certain power of knowledge, a force, which has nothingto do with the erotic, and this has to be set free and united with the knowledge force of manpower at its highest point of development” (HS,97).38Hauer describedbuddhias follows: “Buddhimeans the organ of intuition that is com-posed of puresattva, that light-world-substance which is at the base of cognition or knowl-edge, insight” (HS,96).

So there must be something peculiar inyou, a leading spark, some incentive, that forces you on through thewater and toward the next center. And that is the Kundalini, somethingabsolutely unrecognizable, which can show, say, as fear, as a neurosis, orapparently also as vivid interest; but it must be something which is supe-rior to your will. Otherwise you don’t go through it. You will turn backwhen you meet the first obstacle; as soon as you see the leviathan you willrun away. But if that living spark, that urge, that need, gets you by theneck, then you cannot turn back; you have to face the music.I will give you an example from a medieval book, that famousHypnerotomachia,orLe Songe de Poliphile,39which I have quoted here be-fore. It was written in the fifteenth century by a Christian monk of a fa-mous Roman family. He got into the unconscious, as we say. It is like thebeginning of Dante’sInfernobut expressed in entirely different terms.He depicts himself as traveling in the Black Forest, which in those days,especially to Italians, was still theultima Thulewhere the unicorn stilllived, as wild and unknown as the forests of central Africa to us. Andthere he loses his way, and then a wolf appears. At first he is afraid, butafterward he follows the wolf to a spring where he drinks of the water—an allusion to baptism. Then he comes to the ruins of an ancient Romantown, and he goes in through the gate and sees statues and peculiar sym-bolic inscriptions, which he quotes, and which are most interesting froma psychological point of view. Then suddenly he is afraid; it becomesuncanny. He wants to go back, and he turns to go out through the gateagain, but now there is a dragon sitting behind him that bars the way,and he cannot go back; he simply must go forward. The dragon is Kun-dalini. You see, the Kundalini in psychological terms is that which makesyou go on the greatest adventures. I say, “Oh, damn, why did I ever trysuch a thing?” But if I turn back, then the whole adventure goes out ofmy life, and my life is nothing any longer; it has lost its flavor. It is thisquest that makes life livable, and this is Kundalini; this is the divine urge.For instance, when a knight in the Middle Ages did marvelous works, likethe great labors of Hercules, when he fought dragons and liberated vir-gins, it was all for his Lady—she was Kundalini. And when Leo and Hollygo to Africa to seek She,40and She urges them on to the most incredibleadventures, that is Kundalini.39The Dream of Poliphio, related and interpreted by Linda Fierz-David, translated by MaryHottinger (Bollingen Series XXV; reprint, Dallas,1987). Jung wrote an introduction tothis volume, which is also reproduced inCW, vol.18,§§1749–52.40For Jung’s discussion of Rider Haggard’sShe(London,1887), see hisAnalytical Psychol-ogy,136–44.21"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"LECTURE 1Mrs. Crowley:The anima?Dr. Jung:Yes, the anima is the Kundalini.41That is the very reason whyI hold that this second center, despite the Hindu interpretation of thecrescent being male, is intensely female, for the water is the womb ofrebirth, the baptismal fount. The moon is of course a female symbol;and, moreover, I have a Tibetan picture at home in whichåiva is de-picted in the female form, dancing on the corpses in the burial ground.At all events, the moon is always understood as the receptacle of the soulsof the dead. They migrate to the moon after death, and the moon givesbirth to the souls in the sun. She first gets quite full of dead souls—thatis the pregnant full moon—and then she gives them to the sun, wherethe souls attain new life (a Manichean myth). So the moon is a symbol ofrebirth. Then the moon in this cakra is not above—it is below, like a cupfrom which flows the offering of souls to the cakras above,maõipuraandanvhata. You see, there is the sun myth again.41Jung’s interpretation of the Kundalini as the anima may in part have been suggestedby the following description of her cited inThe Serpent Power: “She . . . is the ‘Inner Woman’to whom reference was made when it was said, ‘What need have I of outer women? I havean Inner Woman within myself’ ” (1st ed.,272). This sentence is heavily marked in Jung’scopy of the book; the whole phrase is cited in his “Die Beschreibung der beiden CentrenShat-chakra Nirupana” (2), and the last phrase, “I have an Inner Woman within myself,” iscited again in his “Avalon Serpent” manuscript (1). In “Concerning Mandala Symbolism”(1950), while commenting on a mandala painted by a young woman in which a coiledsnake appeared, Jung said of the snake: “It is trying to get out: it is the awakening of Kundal-ini, meaning that the patient’s chthonic nature is becoming active. . . . In practice it meansbecoming conscious of one’s instinctual nature.”CW, vol.9, part1,§667.22"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"LECTURE 219October1932Dr. Jung:We will go on with further information about the cakras. Youremember, I told you last time that I would analyze the meaning of thesymbolic attributes of themÖlvdhvra. You probably have noticed that inanalyzing these symbols we have followed very much the same methodthat we use in dream analysis: we look at all the symbols and try to con-struct the meaning which seems to be indicated by the totality of theattributes. In that way we reached the conclusion thatmÖlvdhvrawas asymbol of our conscious earthly personal existence.To repeat in a few words the argument:mÖlvdhvrais characterized asbeing the sign of the earth; the square in the center is the earth, theelephant being the carrying power, the psychical energy or the libido.Then the namemÖlvdhvra, meaning the root support, also shows that weare in the region of the roots of our existence, which would be our per-sonal bodily existence on this earth. Another very important attribute isthat the gods are asleep; theli ́gais a mere germ, and the Kundalini, thesleeping beauty, is the possibility of a world which has not yet come off.So that indicates a condition in which man seems to be the only activepower, and the gods, or the impersonal, non-ego powers, are ineffi-cient—they are doing practically nothing. And that is very much the situ-ation of our modern European consciousness. Then we have still an-other attribute which is not shown in that symbol itself but which is givenin the Hindu commentaries—namely, that this cakra is located, as itwere, in the lower basin, which at once gives an entirely different mean-ing to the thing. For it is then something that is within our body, whereaswe had reached the conclusion that it was without—that is, our con-scious world. That the Hindu commentaries put the conscious world in-side the body is to us a very astonishing fact.We can take this commentary exactly like a patient’s association in adream or vision, and according to his idea, the association would be: itwas something in his belly. Now, why does he say so? Perhaps our exis-tence here in the flesh, in the three-dimensional space, really has some-23"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2thing to do with the symbol in question. Perhaps it is a condition thatcould be expressed by the allegory of an abdomen—as if we were in anabdomen. And to be in an abdomen would mean most probably that wewere in the mother, in a condition of development or beginning. Thatpoint of view would throw a peculiar light on our symbolism. It wouldconvey the idea that our actual existence, this world, is a sort of womb;we are mere beginnings, less than embryos; we are just germs that havestill to become, like an egg in the womb. Of course, this is simply a com-mentary, showing how the Hindu would look upon our world as it is—heperhaps understands his conscious world as being merely a nursery.Now, that is a piece of philosophy. As you see, it is an analogy withChristian philosophy according to which this actual personal existence isonly transitory. We are not meant to stay in this condition; we areplanted on this earth for the purpose of becoming better and better, andwhen we die we shall become angels. In the Islamic world there is verymuch the same idea. I remember talking to an Arab in the tombs of theCaliphs in Cairo. I was admiring a tomb that was made in a wonderfulstyle, really a very beautiful thing. He noticed my admiration and said:You Europeans are funny people. To admire this house is whatwedo, that is what we believe. You believe in dollars and automobilesand railways. But which is wiser, to build a house for a short timeor for a long time? If you know that you will be in a place only fora few years, and that you will later stay in another place for fiftyyears, will you build your house for those few years, or for the fiftyyears?I said, sure enough, “For the fifty years.” And he said: “That is what wedo—we build our houses for eternity, where we shall stay the longest.”1That is the point of view of many peoples, whether they are Hindus orChristians or Mohammedans. According to their ideamÖlvdhvrais atransitory thing, the sprouting condition in which things begin. Ofcourse, that is very much in opposition to what people of today believe.We read our papers, we look into the political and economic world, be-lieving this to be the definite thing, as if all depended on what we weregoing to do about the currency, the general economic conditions, andso on. We are all quite crazy about it, as if it were particularly right to beconcerned with it. But those other people are countless; we are few innumber compared with the people who have an entirely different point1Jung was in Cairo in1926, and his account of his trip is found inMDR,282–304,where this anecdote doesn’t appear.24"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932of view as to the meaning of the world. To them, we are just ridiculous;we are living in a sort of illusion about our world. So this standpoint ofthe yoga philosophy is thus far a part of the general tendency of thephilosophic and religious world. It is very general to look at themÖlvdhvraas a transitory phenomenon.For our purpose we can leave aside this particular philosophic com-ment. It is quite interesting, yet it should not disturb us. For we have totake for granted that this is the world where the real things happen, thatit is the only world, and perhaps there is nothing beyond—at least, wehave no experiences that would prove it to us. We have to be concernedwith the immediate reality, and we must say, as it is shown in themÖlvdhvrasymbol, that the gods which would stand for that other eternalorder of things are asleep. They are inefficient, they mean nothing. Yetwe are allowed to admit that in the very center of this field of conscious-ness are germs of something that point to a different kind of conscious-ness, though for the time being they are inactive. So, to put it on a psy-chological level, it seems evident that even in our consciousness, ofwhich we believe that it is “nothing but,” and perfectly clear and self-evident and banal—even in that field there is the spark of somethingthat points to another conception of life.This is merely a statement about a generally prevailing condition,namely, through theconsensus gentium, the harmony of opinion in thewhole world, among men, it is understood that somewhere in the inte-rior of our normal consciousness, there is such a thing. There are sleep-ing gods, or a germ, that might enable us, as it has enabled people at alltimes, to look at themÖlvdhvraworld from an entirely different point ofview, that allows them even to putmÖlvdhvraright down into the bottomof the trunk where things start—meaning that in the great body of thecosmic world, this world holds the lowest place, the place of the begin-ning. So what we take to be the culmination of a long history and a longevolution would be really a nursery, and the great, important things arehigh above it and are still to come—exactly as the unconscious contentswhich we feel down below in our abdomen are slowly rising to the sur-face and becoming conscious, so that we begin to have the conviction:this is definite, this is clear, this is really what we are after. As long as it wasdown below in the abdomen it simplydisturbed our functions; it was asmall germ. But now it is an embryo, or as it reaches the conscious, it isslowly seen as a full-grown tree.If you look at the symbol of themÖlvdhvrain such a way, you under-stand the purpose of the yoga in the awakening of Kundalini. It means toseparate the gods from the world so that they become active, and with25"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2that one starts the other order of things. From the standpoint of the godsthis world is less than child’s play; it is a seed in the earth, a mere poten-tiality. Our whole world of consciousness is only a seed of the future. Andwhen you succeed in the awakening of Kundalini, so that she begins tomove out of her mere potentiality, you necessarily start a world which isa world of eternity, totally different from our world.Here it will become clear why I speak at length about this wholeproblem.You remember that in our former seminars I always tried to point outto you that the series of visions was an experience of a nonpersonal orimpersonal kind, and to explain to you why I was so particularly reticentin speaking about the personal side of our patient; the personal side isreally perfectly negligible in comparison with her visions. Her visionscould be the visions of anybody, because they are impersonal, they corre-spond to the world of Kundalini and not to the world ofmÖlvdhvra.Theyare experiences which really mean the development of Kundalini andnot of Mrs. So-and-So. Sure enough, a very clever analyst would be ableto analyze out of that material a series of personal incidents in her life,but it would be from only themÖlvdhvrapoint of view, that is, our ra-tional point of view of this world as the definite world. But from thestandpoint of the Kundalini yoga, that aspect is not interesting, becauseit is merely accidental.2mÖlvdhvrais the world of illusion from that otherpoint of view—as the world of the gods, the impersonal experience, isnaturally an illusion from themÖlvdhvrapsychology, the rational view-point of our world.I insist upon this particular symbolism because it really can give you anincomparable opportunity to understand what is meant by the imper-sonal experience, and by the peculiar duality, even duplicity, of thehuman psychology, where two aspects form a bewildering crisscross. Onthe one side the personal aspect, in which all the personal things are theonly meaningful things; and another psychology in which the personalthings are utterly uninteresting and valueless, futile, illusory. You owe itto the existence of these two aspects that you have fundamental conflictsat all, that you have the possibility of another point of view, so that you2When the seminar on visions resumed on2November, Jung reiterated this statement:“You know I must refrain entirely from speaking of the personal life of our patient becauseit leads nowhere; if you begin to think of her as a personal being it will lead you astray.These visions are not to be understood in a personal way, for then it would be nothing butthe subjective foolishness of one person.”The Visions Seminar, vol.7,7. Clearly, the ex-cursus on the psychology of Kundalini yoga was pedagogically intended to drive home thispoint.26"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932can criticize and judge, recognize and understand. For when you are justone with a thing you are completely identical—you cannot compare it,you cannot discriminate, you cannot recognize it. You must always havea point outside if you want to understand. So people who have problem-atic natures with many conflicts are the people who can produce thegreatest understanding, because from their own problematical naturesthey are enabled to see other sides and to judge by comparison. Wecould not possibly judge this world if we had not also a standpoint out-side, and that is given by the symbolism of religious experiences.Now, if the yogin or the Western person succeeds in awakening Kun-dalini, what starts is not in any way a personal development, though ofcourse an impersonal development can influence the personal status, asit does very often and very favorably. But it is not always so. What startsare the impersonal happenings with which you should not identify. Ifyou do, you will soon feel obnoxious consequences—you will get aninflation, you will get all wrong. That is one of the great difficulties inexperiencing the unconscious—that one identifies with it and becomesa fool. You must not identify with the unconscious; you must keep out-side, detached, and observe objectively what happens. But you then seethat all the events that happen in the impersonal, nonhuman order ofthings have the very disagreeable quality that they cling to us, or we clingto them. It is as if the Kundalini in its movement upward were pullingus up with it, as if we were part of that movement, particularly in thebeginning.It is true that wearea part, because we are then that which contains thegods; they are germs in us, germs in themÖlvdhvra, and when they beginto move they have the effect of an earthquake which naturally shakes us,and even shakes our houses down. When that upheaval comes, we arecarried with it, and naturally we might think we were moving upward.But it makes, of course, a tremendous difference whether one flies, orwhether it is a wave or a great wind that lifts one. For to fly is one’s ownactivity, and one can safely come down again, but when one is carriedupward, it is not under one’s control, and one will be put down after awhile in a most disagreeable way—then it means a catastrophe. So, yousee, it is wise not to identify with these experiences but to handle themas if they were outside the human realm. That is the safest thing to do—and really absolutely necessary. Otherwise you get an inflation, and infla-tion is just a minor form of lunacy, a mitigated term for it. And if you getso absolutely inflated that you burst, it is schizophrenia.Of course the idea of an impersonal, psychical experience is verystrange to us, and it is exceedingly difficult to accept such a thing, be-27"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2cause we are so imbued with the fact that our unconscious is our own—my unconscious, his unconscious, her unconscious—and our prejudiceis so strong that we have the greatest trouble disidentifying. Even if wemust recognize that there is a non-ego experience, it is a long way untilwe realize what it might be. That is the reason why these experiences aresecret; they are called mystical because the ordinary world cannot under-stand them, and what they cannot understand they call mystical—thatcovers everything. But the point is that what they call mystical is simplynot the obvious. Therefore the yoga way or the yoga philosophy has al-ways been a secret, but not because people havekeptit secret. For as soonas youkeepa secret it is already an open secret; you know about it andother people know about it, and then it is no longer a secret. The realsecrets are secrets because nobody understands them. One cannoteven talk about them, and of such a kind are the experiences of theKundalini yoga. That tendency to keep things secret is merely a naturalconsequence when the experience is of such a peculiar kind that youhad better not talk about it, for you expose yourself to the greatest mis-understanding and misinterpretation. Even if it is a matter of dogma-tized experience of things that already have a certain form, you still feel,as long as the original fresh impression of such an experience is alive,that you had better continue to cover it up. You feel that these things willnot fit in, that they may have an almost destructive influence upon theconvictions of themÖlvdhvraworld.For the convictions of themÖlvdhvraworld are very necessary. It is ex-ceedingly important that you are rational, that you believe in the defin-iteness of our world, that this world is the culmination of history, themost desirable thing. Such a conviction is absolutely vital. Otherwise youremain detached from themÖlvdhvra—you never get there, you arenever born, even. There are plenty of people who are not yet born. Theyseem to be all here, they walk about—but as a matter of fact, they are notyet born, because they are behind a glass wall, they are in the womb.They are in the world only on parole and are soon to be returned to thepleroma where they started originally. They have not formed a connec-tion with this world; they are suspended in the air; they are neurotic,living the provisional life. They say: “I am now living on such-and-such acondition. If my parents behave according to my wishes, I stay. But if itshould happen that they do something I don’t like, I pop off.” You see,that is the provisional life, a conditioned life, the life of somebody whois still connected by an umbilical cord as thick as a ship’s rope to thepleroma, the archetypal world of splendor. Now, it is most importantthat you should be born; you ought to come into this world—otherwise28"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932you cannot realize the self, and the purpose of this world has beenmissed. Then you must simply be thrown back into the melting pot andbe born again.The Hindus have an extremely interesting theory about that. I am notstrong on metaphysics, but I must admit that in metaphysics there is agreat deal of psychology. You see, it is utterly important that one shouldbe in this world, that one really fulfills one’sentelechia, the germ of lifewhich one is. Otherwise you can never start Kundalini; you can neverdetach. You simply are thrown back, and nothing has happened; it is anabsolutely valueless experience. You must believe in this world, makeroots, do the best you can, even if you have to believe in the most absurdthings—to believe, for instance, that this world is very definite, that itmatters absolutely whether such-and-such a treaty is made or not. It maybe completely futile, but you have to believe in it, have to make it almosta religious conviction, merely for the purpose of putting your signatureunder the treaty, so that trace is left of you. For you should leave sometrace in this world which notifies that you have been here, that some-thing has happened. If nothing happens of this kind you have not real-ized yourself; the germ of life has fallen, say, into a thick layer of air thatkept it suspended. It never touched the ground, and so never could pro-duce the plant. But if you touch the reality in which you live, and stay forseveral decades if you leave your trace, then the impersonal process canbegin. You see, the shoot must come out of the ground, and if the per-sonal spark has never gotten into the ground, nothing will come out ofit; noli ́gaor Kundalini will be there, because you are still staying in theinfinity that was before.Now if, as I say, you succeed in completing yourentelechia,thatshootwill come up from the ground; namely, that possibility of a detachmentfrom this world—from the world ofMvyv, as the Hindu would say—which is a sort of depersonalization. For inmÖlvdhvrawe are just identi-cal. We are entangled in the roots, and we ourselves are the roots. Wemake roots, we cause roots to be, we are rooted in the soil, and there isno getting away for us, because we must be there as long as we live. Thatidea, that we can sublimate ourselves and become entirely spiritual andno hair left, is an inflation. I am sorry, that is impossible; it makes nosense. Therefore we must invent a new scheme, and we speak of the im-personal. Other times may invent other terms for the same thing.You know, in India they do not say “personal” and “impersonal,” “sub-jective” and “objective,” “ego” and “non-ego.” They speak ofbuddhi, per-sonal consciousness, and Kundalini, which is the other thing; and theynever dream of identifying the two. They never think, “I myself am Kun-29"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2dalini.” Quite the contrary, they can experience the divine because theyare so deeply conscious of the utter difference of God and man. We areidentical with it from the beginning because our gods, inasmuch as theyare not just conscious abstractions, are mere germs, or functions, let ussay. The divine thing in us functions as neuroses of the stomach, or of thecolon, or bladder—simply disturbances of the underworld. Our godshave gone to sleep, and they stir only in the bowels of the earth.3For ourconscious idea of God is abstract and remote. One hardly dares to speakof it. It has become taboo, or it is such a worn-out coin that one canhardly exchange it.Well now, Kundalini yoga in its system of cakras symbolizes the devel-opment of that impersonal life. Therefore it is at the same time an initia-tion symbolism, and it is the cosmogonic myth. I will tell you one exam-ple. There is a Pueblo myth according to which man was generated fardown in the earth in a pitch-black cave. Then, after untold time of adormant and absolutely dark wormlike existence, two heavenly messen-gers came down and planted all the plants. Finally they found a canewhich was long enough to go through the opening in the roof and wasjointed like a ladder, so mankind could climb up and reach the floor ofthe next cave; but it was still dark. Then, after a long time, they againplaced the cane under the roof and again climbed up and reached thethird cave. And so again, until finally they came to the fourth cave wherethere was light, but an incomplete and ghostly light. That cave openedout upon the surface of the earth, and for the first time they reached thesurface; but it was still dark. Then they learned to make a brilliant light,out of which finally the sun and the moon were made.You see, this myth depicts very beautifully how consciousness came topass, how it rises from level to level. Those were cakras, new worlds ofconsciousness of natural growths, one above the other. And this is thesymbolism of all initiation cults: the awakening out ofmÖlvdhvra,andthegoing into the water, the baptismal fount with the danger of the makara,the devouring quality or attribute of the sea.Then, if you pass through that danger you reach the next center,maõipÖra, which means the fullness of jewels. It is the fire center, reallythe place where the sun rises. The sun now appears; the first light comesafter the baptism. This is like the initiation rites in the Isis mysteries,3In his “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower’ ” (1929) Jung wrote: “Thegods have become diseases; Zeus no longer rules Olympus but rather the solar plexus andproduces curious specimens for the doctor’s consulting room” (CW, vol.13, §54). For areevaluation of this often-cited notion, see Wolfgang Giegerich, “Killings,”Spring: A Journalof Archetype and Culture54(1993):9–18.30"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932according to Apuleius, where the initiate at the end of the ceremony wasput upon the pedestal and worshiped as the god Helios, the deificationthat always follows the baptismal rite.4You are born into a new existence;you are a very different being and have a different name.One sees all that very beautifully in the Catholic rite of baptism whenthe godfather holds the child and the priest approaches with the burn-ing candle and says:Dono tibi lucem eternam” (I give thee the eternallight)—which means, I give you relatedness to the sun, to the God. Youreceive the immortal soul, which you did not possess before; you arethen a “twice-born.” Christ receives his mission and the spirit of God inhis baptism in the Jordan. He is only a Christus after baptism becauseChristus meant the anointed one. He too is “twice-born.” He is nowabove the ordinary mortal that he was as Jesus, the son of the carpenter.He is now a Christus, a nonpersonal or symbolic personality, no longera mere person belonging to this or that family. He belongs to the wholeworld, and in his life it becomes evident that this is a very much moreimportant role than if he were the son of Joseph and Mary.SomaõipÖrais the center of the identification with the god, where onebecomes part of the divine substance, having an immortal soul. You arealready part of that which is no longer in time, in three-dimensionalspace; you belong now to a fourth-dimensional order of things wheretime is an extension, where space does not exist and time is not, wherethere is only infinite duration—eternity.This is a worldwide and ancient symbolism, not only in the Christianbaptism and the initiation in the Isis mysteries. For instance, in the reli-gious symbolism of ancient Egypt, the dead Pharaoh goes to the under-world and embarks in the ship of the sun. You see, to approach divinitymeans the escape from the futility of the personal existence and theachieving of the eternal existence, the escape to a nontemporal form ofexistence. The Pharaoh climbs into the sun bark and travels through thenight and conquers the serpent, and then rises again with the god, andis riding over the heavens for all eternity. That idea spread in the latercenturies, so that even the nobles who were particularly friendly with thePharaoh succeeded in climbing into the ship of Ra. Therefore one findsso many mummies buried in the tomb of the Pharaohs, the hope beingthat all the bodies in the tombs would rise with him. I saw something verytouching in a newly excavated tomb in Egypt. Just before they hadlocked up the tomb of this particular noble, one of the workmen had puta little baby that had recently died, in a miserable little basket of reeds4Lucius Apuleius,The Golden Ass, translated by Robert Graves (London,1950),286.31"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2with a few poor little pieces of cloth, right inside the door, so that thebaby—who was probably his child—would rise with the noble on thegreat day of judgment. He was quite satisfied with his own futility, but hisbaby, at least, should reach the sun. So this third center is rightly calledthe fullness of jewels. It is the great wealth of the sun, the never-endingabundance of divine power to which man attains through baptism.But of course, that is all symbolism. We come now to the psychologicalinterpretation, which is not as easy as the symbolic or comparativemethod.5It is far less easy to understandmaõipÖrafrom a psychologicalpoint of view. If one dreams of baptism, of going into the bath or into thewater, you know what it means when people are in actual analysis: thatthey are being pushed into the unconscious to be cleansed; they mustget into the water for the sake of renewal. But it remains dark what fol-lows after the bath. It is very difficult to explain in psychological termswhat will follow when you have made your acquaintance with the uncon-scious. Have you an idea? Mind you, this question is not easy to answer,because you will be inclined to give an abstract answer, for a psychologi-cal reason.Dr. Reichstein:You could say that the old world is burning down.Dr. Jung:That is not just abstract, but it is very universal and at a safedistance.Dr. Reichstein:The old conventional forms and ideas are breakingdown.Dr. Jung:Oh yes, our philosophy of the world may be changed tre-mendously, but that is no proof that you have reachedmaõipÖra.Dr. Reichstein:But is notmaõipÖraa symbol of fire, of things burned?Dr. Jung:Well, it is not just a destructive symbol; it means more asource of energy. But you are quite right—there is always a note of de-struction when one speaks of fire; the mere mention of fire is enough torouse the idea of destruction. And there you touch upon that fear thatcauses abstraction; we easily get abstract when we do not want to toucha thing that is too hot.Miss Hannah:Is one not able, then, to see the opposites at the sametime?Dr. Jung:Yes, that is nicely put, very abstract, but you could designateit more completely.Mrs. Sawyer:In the visions, the patient came to the place where she hadto stand the fire, and then the stars fell down.6So the impersonal thingsbegan.5The contrast is to Hauer’s method of interpretation.6SeeThe Visions Seminar, vol.5,9March1932,114.32"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932Dr. Jung:Quite so—there we have a connection.Dr. Bertine:Is it not a capacity for living more fully? A greater intensityof conscious living?Dr. Jung:We think we are living quite consciously and with great inten-sity. What is the next effect when you become acquainted with the un-conscious and take it seriously? You see you are inclined not to take itseriously and to invent an apotropaic theory that is “nothing but”—noth-ing but infantile memories or inhibited wishes, for instance. Why do youaccept such a theory? In reality it is something quite different.Mrs. Crowley:It is becoming acquainted with the shadow part.Dr. Jung:That is also conveniently put, but what does it mean?Mrs. Sigg:Isolation.Dr. Jung:That might be the consequence of it, but first of all it is justthe horrible thing that leads into isolation, just the opposite.Mrs. Crowley:Desirousness, all that shadow part of yourself.Dr. Jung:Yes, desire, passions, the whole emotional world breaks loose.Sex, power, and every devil in our nature gets loose when we becomeacquainted with the unconscious. Then you will suddenly see a new pic-ture of yourself. That is why people are afraid and say there is no uncon-scious, like children playing hide-and-seek. A child goes behind a doorand says, “Nobody is behind this door; don’t look here!” And so we havetwo marvelous psychological theories that nothing is behind this door,don’t look here, this is nothing important.7Those are apotropaic theo-ries. But you will see that there is something, you must admit that thereare such powers. Then you make an abstraction, you make marvelousabstract signs of it, and talk of it with only a sort of shy hinting. You speakeuphemistically. As sailors never dared to say, “This damned hell of a sea,this black sea that is always so stormy and smashes our ships!” They said,“The welcoming benevolent sea . . .”—in order not to arouse thosealarming impressions, or to irritate those dark wind demons. Instead ofsaying the archbishop of Canterbury, you say His Grace. You don’t saythe pope has issued a very foolish encyclica, you say the Vatican. Or in-stead of speaking of those hellish liars, you say Wilhelmstraße, or Down-ing Street, or the Quai d’Orsay. That is the euphemistic abstract way ofputting things. Our science has the same purpose in using Latin orGreek words. It is a marvelous shield against the demons—the demonsare afraid of Greek because they do not understand it. And therefore wetalk, as you have just demonstrated, in such an abstract way.So it is just that—you get into the world of fire, where things becomered-hot. After baptism you get right into hell—that is the enantiodromia.7The reference is to Freud’s psychoanalysis and Adler’s individual psychology.33"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2And now comes the paradox of the East: it is also the fullness of jewels.But what is passion, what are emotions? There is the source of fire, thereis the fullness of energy. A man who is not on fire is nothing: he is ridic-ulous, he is two-dimensional. He must be on fire even if he does make afool of himself. A flame must burn somewhere, otherwise no light shines;there is no warmth, nothing. It is terribly awkward, sure enough; it ispainful, full of conflict, apparently a mere waste of time—at all events, itis against reason. But that accursed Kundalini says, “It is the fullness ofjewels; there is the source of energy.” As Heraclitus aptly said: war is thefather of all things.Now this third center, the center of emotions, is localized in theplexussolaris, or the center of the abdomen. I have told you that my first discov-ery about the Kundalini yoga was that these cakras really are concernedwith what are called psychical localizations. This center then would bethe first psychical localization that is within our conscious psychical expe-rience. I must refer again to the story of my friend, the Pueblo chief, whothought that all Americans were crazy because they were convinced thatthey thought in the head. He said: “But we think in the heart.” That isanvhata.8Then there are primitive tribes who have their psychical local-ization in the abdomen. And that is true of us as well; there is a certaincategory of psychical events that take place in the stomach. Thereforeone says, “Something weighs on my stomach.” And if one is very angry,one gets jaundice; if one is afraid, one has diarrhea; or if in a particularlyobstinate mood, one is constipated. You see, that shows what psychicallocalization means.Thinking in the abdomen means that there was once a time when con-sciousness was so dim that people noticed only the things that disturbedtheir intestinal functions, and everything else simply passed by theboard; it did not exist because it had no effect upon them. There are stilltraces of that among the central Australian aborigines, who have the fun-niest ceremonies in order to make them realize a thing. I told you aboutthe ceremony of making a man angry; and one sees other forms of thesame thing in all primitive tribes. Before they can make up their mindsto go hunting, for instance, there must be a whole ceremonial by whichthey are put into the mood of hunting; otherwise they don’t do it. Theymust be excited by something. It has to do not only with the intestines,then, but with the whole body.Therefore that primitive method of the schoolmasters fifty years ago,8Hauer described theanvhatacakra as “the heart lotus, which means the one that hasnot or cannot be hurt” (HS,69).34"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932which I myself have experienced. We were taught the ABCs with a whip.We were eight boys sitting on one bench, and the schoolmaster had awhip of three willow wands, just long enough to touch all the backs atonce. He said, “This is A” (bang), “This is B” (bang). You see, causing aphysical sensation was the old method of teaching. It was not very pain-ful, because when he beat on eight backs at the same time you justcringed and didn’t feel it very much. But it makes an impression; theboys were actually sitting up and listening. That was instead of “Will yoube kind enough to pay attention, please?” Then nobody listens; theythink he is a damned fool. But when he cracks the whip over them andsays, “Thatis A,” then they get it.It is for the same reason that primitives inflict wounds in initiationswhen they hand over the secrets, the mystical teaching of the tribe. Atthe same time they cause intense pain: they make cuts and rub ashes intothem, or they starve the initiants, they don’t let them sleep, or frightenthem out of their wits. Then they give the teaching, and it catches holdof them because it has gone in with physical discomfort or pain.Now, as I said, the first psychical localization that is conscious to us isthe abdomen; we are not conscious of anything deeper. I don’t know ofa trace in primitive psychology where people would locate their psychein their bladder. Then the next is the heart, which is a very definite cen-ter that still functions with us. For instance we say, “You know it in thehead, but you don’t know it in the heart.” There is an extraordinary dis-tance from the head to the heart, a distance of ten, twenty, thirty years,or a whole lifetime. For you can know something in the head for fortyyears and it may never have touched the heart. But only when you haverealized it in the heart do you begin to take notice of it. And from theheart it is an equally long distance down to theplexus solaris,andthenyou are caught. For there you have no freedom at all. There is no airsubstance: you are just bones and blood and muscles; you are in the in-testines; you are functioning there like a worm with no head. But in theheart you are on the surface. The diaphragm would be about the surfaceoftheearth.AslongasyouareinmaõipÖrayou are in the terrible heatof the center of the earth, as it were. There is only the fire of passion, ofwishes, of illusions. It is the fire of which Buddha speaks in his sermon inBenares where he says, The whole world is in flames, your ears, your eyes,everywhere you pour out the fire of desire, and that is the fire of illusionbecause you desire things which are futile. Yet there is the great treasureof the released emotional energy.So when people become acquainted with the unconscious they oftenget into an extraordinary state—they flare up, they explode, old buried35"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2emotions come up, they begin to weep about things which happenedforty years ago. That simply means that they were prematurely detachedfrom that stage of life; they have forgotten that there are buried fires stillburning. Then they were unconscious, but when they touch the lowercenters, they get back into that world and become aware that it is stillhot, like a fire that has been left forgotten under the ashes. But take awaythe ashes and there are still the glowing embers underneath, as it is saidof pilgrims going to Mecca: they leave their fires buried under the ashes,and when they return the following year the embers are still glowing.Now, inmaõipÖrayou have reached an upper layer where there comesa definite change.9The bodily localization of this cakra under the dia-phragm is the symbol for the peculiar change that now takes place.Above the diaphragm you come intoanvhata, the heart or air center,because the heart is embedded in the lungs and the whole activity of theheart is closely associated with the lungs. One must be naive to under-stand these things. In primitive experience, it is the same thing. In fact,it is a physiological truth. We understand more or less whatmaõipÖrameans psychologically, but now we come to the great leap,anvhata.What follows psychologically after you have fallen into hell? When youhave come into the whirlpool of passions, of instincts, of desires and soon, what follows after?Mrs. Crowley:Usually an enantiodromia; some opposite will now beconstellated. Some vision perhaps, or something more impersonal willfollow.Dr. Jung:An enantiodromia, which would be the discovery of some-thing impersonal? In other words, that one no longer identifies withone’s desires. Now, one must consider the fact that it is hard to talk ofthese things, because most people are still identical withmaõipÖra.Itisexceedingly difficult to find out what is beyond. Therefore we must re-main a bit in the symbolism first. The next center, as I told you, has to dowith the air. The diaphragm would correspond to the surface of theearth, and apparently in getting intoanvhatawe reach the conditionwhere we are lifted up from the earth. What has happened? How do weget there at all? You see inmaõipÖrawe still don’t know where we are; weare inmÖlvdhvrajust as well, at least our feet are still standing inmÖlvdhvra: but inanvhatathey are lifted up above the surface of theearth. Now, what could literally lift one above the earth?Dr. Meier:The wind.9In the manuscript “Die Beschreibung der beidem Centrem Shat-chakra Nirupana”Jung describedmaõipÖraas “center of corporeal men, carnivores” (2; my translation).36"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932Dr. Jung:Yes, that would be within the symbolism, but there is anotherthing that would make it a bit plainer.Dr. Bertine:A sort of distillation?Dr. Jung:That is a good idea, which leads us right away into alchemisticsymbolism. The alchemist calls this process sublimation. But to remainin the symbolism of which we were speaking today?Mr. Allemann:The sun rises above the horizon.Dr. Jung:Yes, you rise above the horizon according to the Egyptiansymbolism. If you are identical with the sun, you rise above the horizonwith the sun ship and travel over the heavens. The sun is a superiorpower. If you are an appendix of the Pharaoh, the sun can lift you up toalmost a divine position. And the contact with the sun inmaõipÖraliftsyou up off your feet into the sphere above the earth. The wind also cando it, because in primitive beliefs the spirit is a kind of wind.Therefore in many languages there is the same word for wind andspirit,spiritusfor instance, andspiraremeanstobloworbreathe.Animus,spirit, comes from the Greekanemos, wind; andpneuma, spirit, is also aGreek word for wind. In Arabicruchis the wind or soul of the spirit; andin Hebrewruachmeans spirit and wind. The connection between windand spirit is due to the fact that the spirit was thought originally to be thebreath, the air one breathes out or expires. With a person’s last breathhis spirit leaves the body. So it would be either a magic wind or the sunthat lifts you up. And where do we find the two things coming together?Perhaps you still remember in analytical literature that very interestingcase.Mrs. Sawyer:Is it the primitives blowing on their hands and worshipingthe sunrise?Dr. Jung:That is identification with the sun. It is not the same, you see,but I have published an example of the wind and the sun being the same.Mr. Baumann:The sun is sometimes the origin of the wind.Dr. Jung:Yes. You remember the case of the insane man who saw a sortof tube hanging down from the sun. He called it the “sun phallus,” andit caused the wind. That shows that the sun and the wind are the same.1010InTransformations and Symbols of the Libido(1912), Jung cited his pupil Johann Ho-negger’s discovery of a patient’s hallucination: “The patient sees in the sun a so-called ‘up-right tail’ (i.e., much like an erect penis). When the patient moves his head back and forth,the sun’s penis also moves back and forth, and from this the wind arises. This strange delu-sionary idea remained unintelligible to us for a long time, until I became acquainted withthe visions of the Mithraic liturgy.”Psychology of the Unconscious,inCWB, §173; translationmodified. In1927Jung stated that he made this observation in1906and came acrossAlbrecht Dietrich’sEine Mithrasliturgie(A Mithras liturgy) (Leipzig,1903)in1910,whichruled out the possibility of cryptomnesia (the revival of forgotten memories) or telepathy37"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2Mr. Baumann:I think there is a Greek myth, where you hear voicesbefore the sun has risen.Dr. Jung:That is the figure of Memnon in Egypt, which was said toproduce a peculiar sound when the sun rises, because according to theGreek legend Memnon is the son of Aurora, the dawn, so when dawnappears he greets his mother. But that is not exactly the wind and thesun. You see, the symbolism tells us what happens inanvhata. But that isnot psychological; we are really in mythology so far, and we ought toknow what it means psychologically. How do you get lifted up above themaõipÖracenter, above the world of your mere emotions?Miss Hannah:You get an inflation, and you identify with the god.Dr. Jung:That might be, it is very inflating, but we are speaking here ofthe normal case. We are supposing that sequence of the Kundalini is anormal sequence, because it is the condensation of the experiences ofperhaps thousands of years.Mr. Baumann:When you are very emotional you try to express your-self, for instance, by music or poetry.Dr. Jung:You mean it produces a certain utterance. But emotions al-ways produce utterances. You can manifest all sorts of things when youare still caught in your emotions. It must be something above the emo-tions.Mrs. Mehlich:Is it that one begins to think?Dr. Jung:Exactly.Dr. Reichstein:It is said that here thepuruüa11is born, so it would behere that the first idea of the self is seen more completely.Dr. Jung:Yes, but how would that show in psychology? We must try nowto bring the thing down to psychological facts.Dr. Reichstein:That we become conscious of something which is notpersonal at this point.Dr. Jung:Yes, you begin to reason, to think, to reflect about things, andso it is the beginning of a sort of contraction or withdrawal from themere emotional function. Instead of following your impulses wildly, youand hence provided evidence for the collective unconscious. The editors noted that Jungsubsequently learned that the1910edition was the second edition, and that the originalhad actually been published in1903. They added that the patient had been committedprior to1903.CW, vol.8, §§319–21.11Woodroffe definedpuruüaas “a center of limited consciousness—limited by the associ-ated Prakùti and its products of Mind and Matter.

You stopyourself in your wild mood and suddenly ask, “Why am I behaving likethis?”We find the symbolism for that in this center. Inanvhatayou beholdthepuruüa, a small figure that is the divine self, namely, that which is notidentical with mere causality, mere nature, a mere release of energy thatruns down blindly with no purpose.12People lose themselves completelyin their emotions and deplete themselves, and finally they are burned tobits and nothing remains—just a heap of ashes, that is all. The samething occurs in lunacy: people get into a certain state and cannot get outof it. They burn up in their emotions and explode. There is a possibilitythat one detaches from it, however, and when a man discovers this, hereally becomes a man. ThroughmaõipÖrahe is in the womb of nature,extraordinarily automatic; it is merely a process. But inanvhataanewthing comes up, the possibility of lifting himself above the emotionalhappenings and beholding them.

It is the withdrawal from the emotions; you are no longeridentical with them. If you succeed in remembering yourself, if you suc-ceed in making a difference between yourself and that outburst of pas-sion, then you discover the self; you begin to individuate. So inanvhataindividuation begins. But here again you are likely to get an inflation.Individuation is not that you become an ego—you would then becomean individualist. You know, an individualist is a man who did not succeedin individuating; he is a philosophically distilled egotist. Individuation isbecoming that thing which is not the ego, and that is very strange. There-fore nobody understands what the self is, because the self is just the thingwhich you are not, which is not the ego. The ego discovers itself as beinga mere appendix of the self in a sort of loose connection. For the ego is12In his commentary on Patanjali’sYoga Sutras, Jung stated, concerning the translationof the termpuruüa, “Deussen designates [it] as ‘das von allem Objectiven freie Subject desErkennens’ [the subject of knowledge freed from everything objective]. I doubt this defini-tion—it is too logical, and the East is not logical; it is observant and intuitive. So it is betterto describe thepuruüaas primeval man or as the luminous man.”Modern Psychology3,121.13Katha Upanisad2.20–21; cited also inCW, vol.6, §329, wherepuruüais rendered as“Self.”39"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"LECTURE 2always far down inmÖlvdhvraand suddenly becomes aware of somethingup above in the fourth story, inanvhata, and that is the self.Now, if anybody makes the mistake of thinking that he lives at thesame time in the basement and on the fourth story, that he is thepuruüahimself, he is crazy. He is what the German very aptly callverrückt, carriedoff his feet up to somewhere else. He just sits up there and spins. We areallowed to behold only thepuruüa, to behold his feet up there. But we arenot thepuruüa; that is a symbol that expresses the impersonal process.The self is something exceedingly impersonal, exceedingly objective. Ifyou function in your self you are not yourself—that is what you feel. Youhave to do it as if you were a stranger: you will buy as if you did not buy;you will sell as if you did not sell. Or, as St. Paul expresses it, “But it is notI that lives, it is Christ that liveth in me,” meaning that his life had be-come an objective life, not his own life but the life of a greater one, thepuruüa.All the primitive tribes that are on a somewhat higher level of civiliza-tion usually have discoveredanvhata. That is, they begin to reason, andto judge; they are no longer quite wild. They have elaborate ceremo-nies—the more primitive they are the more elaborate are the ceremo-nies. They need them in order to preventmaõipÖrapsychology. Theyhave invented all sorts of things, magic circles, forms for the palavers, forthe intercourse of people; all those peculiar ceremonials are special psy-chological techniques to prevent an explosion ofmaõipÖra. In a palaverwith primitives it is simplyde rigueurthat you do certain things—to us,perfectly superfluous things—but you can do nothing with the primitivesunless you observe the rules.For instance, there must be an unmistakable hierarchy; therefore theman who calls the palaver must be a man of power. If I call a palaver, Imust have a stool, and the other people are on the ground; they must sitdown immediately. The chief has men with whips who whip everybodydown if they don’t sit down at once. And then one does not begin to talk.One first hands around presents—matches, cigarettes—and the chiefnecessarily must have many more cigarettes than his subjects, becausethe hierarchy of that moment must be emphasized to show that there isauthority on top.14That is all ceremony againstmaõipÖra, and only whenthat is silently done can the man who calls the palaver begin to speak. Isay that I have ashauri, a business. That is the beginning. You see, I mustspeak a mantra by which everybody is caught—nobody is allowed to talk;everybody listens. Then I say myshauri, after which my partner, with14For Jung’s account of his palavers among the Elgonyi in Kenya in1925–26,whichoverlaps with his description here, seeMDR,293–97.40"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"19 OCTOBER 1932whom I have to deal, talks too, but in a very low voice, hardly audible,and he shall not get up. If a man speaks too loudly, somebody comes witha whip. He may not speak loudly, because that would show emotion, andas soon as there is emotion, there is danger of fighting and killing.Therefore no weapons are allowed. Also, when the palaver ends onemust sayshauri kisha, meaning, “Now the palaver is finished.”I once got up before I had said that, and my headman came quiteexcitedly to me and said, “Now, don’t get up!” And then I saidshaurikisha, and everything was all right. If I said a mantra, I could go. I mustsay that the whole magic circle is now dissolved, and then I can go with-out rousing the suspicion that somebody is offended or in a wild mood.Otherwise it is dangerous, then there might be anything, perhaps mur-der, for one is getting up obviously because one is crazy. It sometimeshappens that they get so excited in their dances that they begin to kill.For instance, those two cousins Sarasin, who made the exploration inCelebes, were almost killed by men who were really very friendly withthem.15They were showing them the war dances, and they got so muchin the mood of war, so frenzied, that they threw their spears at them. Itwas sheer luck that they escaped.You see,anvhatais still very feeble, andmaõipÖrapsychology is quiteclose to us. We still have to be polite to people to avoid the explosions ofmaõipÖra.15Paul and Fritz Sarasin published an account of their anthropological expeditions inReisen in Celebes ausgeführt in den Jahren1893–1896und1902–1903(Travels in Celebestaken in the years1893–1896and1902–1903),2vols.

You remember,we were speaking chiefly of the transformation frommaõipÖratoanvhata.Inanvhatasomething is attained which was begun inmulv-dhvra, through a series of four stages. How might these four stages alsobe designated?Dr. Reichstein:They are the four elements.Dr. Jung:Exactly. Each of the four lower centers has an element be-longing to it—mÖlvdhvra, the earth,svvdhiü°hvna, the water, then comesfire inmaõipÖra, and finally air inanvhata. So one can see the wholething as a sort of transformation of elements, with the increase of volatil-ity—of volatile substance. And the next form we reach isviçuddha,1which is the ether center. Now, what is ether? Do you know anythingabout it from the physical point of view?Remark:It penetrates everything.Mrs. Sawyer:You cannot catch it.Dr. Jung:Why not? Since it penetrates everywhere, why can it not befound everywhere?Mr. Dell:It cannot be measured; it is a thought.Dr. Jung:Yes, one finds it only within one’s brain, nowhere else; it is aconcept of substance that hasnone of thequalities that matter shouldhave. It is matter that is not matter, and such a thing must necessarily bea concept. Now, in theviçuddhacenter—beyond the four elements—onereaches what stage?Mrs. Crowley:A more conscious state, abstract thought perhaps?Dr. Jung:Yes, one reaches a sphere of abstraction. There one stepsbeyond the empirical world, as it were, and lands in a world of concepts.And what are concepts? What do we call the substance of concepts?Mrs. Crowley:Psychology?Dr. Jung:Or say psychical psychology; that would express the science1Hauer described theviçuddhacakra as “the cleansed one, or cleansing” (HS,69).42"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932of psychical things. The reality we reach there is a psychical reality; it isa world of psychical substance, if we can apply such a term. I think we getnearest to it when we say it is a world of psychical reality. So anotherpoint of view to explain the series of the cakras would be a climbing upfrom gross matter to the subtle, psychical matter. Now, the idea of thistransformation from earth to ether is one of the oldest constituents ofHindu philosophy. The concept of the five elements is a part of theSamkhya philosophy, which is pre-Buddhistic, belonging to the seventhcenturyB.C. at the latest. All subsequent Hindu philosophies, like theUpanisads, took their origin in the Samkhya philosophy. So this conceptof the five elements dates back endlessly—there is no way of telling itsage. One sees from the age of that component that the fundamentalideas of tantric yoga reach back into a dim past. Also the idea of thetransformation of the elements shows the analogy of tantric yoga withour medieval alchemistic philosophy. There one finds exactly the sameideas, the transformation of the gross matter into the subtle matter ofthe mind—the sublimation of man, as it was then understood.Speaking of this alchemistic aspect of the cakras, I want to call yourattention to the symbol ofmaõipÖra, the fire center. You remember, per-haps, that in the fire center there are those peculiar handles, one couldcall them, which Professor Hauer hypothetically explained as parts ofthe swastika.2Now, I must confess that I never have seen a swastika sym-bol that had only three feet. There is the Greek form of thetriskelos, butI don’t know whether that existed in India. It was found on Greek coinsin Sicily, from a period between four hundred and about two hundredB.C.—when Sicily belonged to Graecia Magna and was a large and flour-ishing Greek colony. Thetriskelosis like this: the three-legged being. Butthe swastika is like this: running on four feet. So I suggest that thesemight be handles attached to the triangle ofmaõipÖra. I rather think thatthey are handles of a pot—to lift the pot—and there is a lid on top whichhas also a handle. I think that is probably to be explained from the al-chemistic aspect, becausemaõipÖrais the fire region, and that is thekitchen, or the stomach, where the food is cooked. One stuffs the foodinto the pot, or into the belly, and there it is heated by the blood. In thatway food is prepared so that one can digest it.Cooking is an anticipation of digestion, a sort of predigestion. For ex-ample, in Africa the papaya tree has the very peculiar quality that its fruitand leaves are full of pepsin, the same stuff which is found in the juice ofthe stomach, the digestive stuff par excellence. The Negroes wrap up2Ibid.,75.43"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"LECTURE 3their meat for two or three hours in papaya leaves instead of cookingit—it thus becomes partially digested; it is predigested. And so the wholeart of cooking is predigestion. We have transferred part of our digestiveability into the kitchen, so the kitchen is the stomach of every house, andthe labor of preparing the food is then taken away from our stomachs.Our mouth is also a predigestive organ, because the saliva contains adigestive substance. The mechanical action of the teeth is predigestive,because we cut up the food, which is what we also do in the kitchen incutting up the vegetables, and so on. So you could really say that thekitchen is a digestive tract projected from the human body. And it is thealchemistic place where things are transformed.ThereforemaõipÖrawould be a center in which substances are di-gested, transformed. The next thing one would expect would be thetransformation shown as completed. As a matter of fact, this center isright below the diaphragm, which marks the dividing line betweenanvhataand the centers of the abdomen.For aftermaõipÖrafollowsanvhata,3in which entirely new thingsoccur; a new element is there, air, no longer gross matter. Even fire isunderstood to be in a way gross matter. It is thicker, denser than air, andit is quite visible, whereas air is invisible. Fire is exceedingly movable, yetperfectly well defined, and also in a way tangible, whereas air is exceed-ingly light and almost intangible—unless you feel it as a wind. It is rela-tively gentle in comparison with fire, which moves and burns.So at the diaphragm you cross the threshold from the visible tangiblethings to the almost invisible intangible things. And these invisible thingsinanvhataare the psychical things, for this is the region of what is calledfeeling and mind. The heart is characteristic of feeling, and air is charac-teristic of thought. It is the breath-being; therefore one has always identi-fied the soul and thought with breath.For instance, it is the custom in India, when the father dies, that theoldest son must watch during the last moments in order to inhale the lastbreath of his father, which is the soul, in order to continue his life. TheSwahili wordrohomeans the stertorous breathing of a dying man, whichwe call in Germanröcheln;androhoalso means the soul. It is no doubttaken from the Arabic wordruch, which means wind, breath, spirit, withprobably the same original idea of stertorous breathing. So the originalidea of spirit or of psychical things is the idea of breath or air. And I toldyou that the mind in Latin isanimus, which is identical with the Greekwordánemosmeaning wind.3Hauer stated of theanvhatacakra: “This heart lotus is the cakra of the fundamentalinsights into life; it is what we call the creative life in the highest sense” (HS,90–91).44"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932The heart is always characteristic of feeling because feeling conditionsinfluence the heart. Everywhere in the world feelings are associated withthe heart. If you have no feelings, you have no heart; if you have no cour-age, you have no heart, because courage is a definite feeling condition.And you say, “Take it to heart.” Or you learn something “by heart.” Youlearn it, of course, by the head but you won’t keep it in mind unless youtake it to heart. Only if you learn a thing by heart do you really get it. Inother words, if it is not associated with your feelings, if it has not sunkinto your body until it reaches theanvhatacenter, it is so volatile that itflies away. It must be associated with the lower center in order to be kept.Therefore that method of teaching pupils that I described to you lastweek, where the teacher used the whip, in order that their feelings ofanger and suffering would make the pupils remember the letters. If theywere not associated with pain, they would not keep them. That is particu-larly true for the primitive man: he learns nothing if not in such a way.The real importance of thoughts and values becomes clear to us onlywhen we consider them as compelling forces in our lives. The beginningof such a recognition of such values and thoughts in primitives would beembodied in the secret teaching of the tribe, which is given at the timeof the puberty initiations together with pain and torture to make themremember it. At the same time they are taught certain moral values,which prevent the mere blind action of themaõipÖrafires of passion.Soanvhatais really the center where psychical things begin, the recog-nition of values and ideas. When man has reached that level in civiliza-tion or in his individual development one could say he was inanvhata,and there he gets the first inkling of the power and substantiality, or thereal existence, of psychical things.For instance, take a patient in analysis who has reached the stage ofmaõipÖra, where he is an absolute prey to his emotions and passions. Isay: “But you really ought to be a bit reasonable; don’t you see what youdo? You cause no end of trouble to your relations.” And it makes noimpression whatever. But then these arguments begin to have a pull; oneknows that the threshold of the diaphragm is crossed—he has reachedanvhata. You see, values, convictions, general ideas are psychical factsthat are nowhere to be met with in natural science. One cannot catchthem with a butterfly net, nor can one find them under microscopes.They become visible only inanvhata. Now according to tantric yoga, thepuruüais first seen inanvhata: the essence of man, the supreme man, theso-called primordial man then becomes visible. Sopuruüais identicalwith the psychical substance of thought and value, feeling. In the recog-nition of feelings and of ideas one sees thepuruüa. That is the first ink-ling of a being within your psychological or psychical existence that is45"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"LECTURE 3not yourself—a being in which you are contained, which is greater andmore important than you but which has an entirely psychical existence.You see, we could finish here; we could say that about covers thegrowth of humanity. As we are all convinced that psychical things have acertain weight, mankind as a whole has about reachedanvhata. For in-stance, the great war has taught practically everybody that the things thathave the greatest weight are theimponderabilia, the things you cannotpossibly weigh, like public opinion or psychical infection. The whole warwas a psychical phenomenon. If you are looking for the causal root of it,it could not possibly be explained as arising out of the reason of man orout of economic necessity. One could say that Germany needed agreater expansion and had to go to war, or that France felt threatenedand had to crush Germany. But nobody was threatened—everybody hadenough money, the Germanexports were increasing from year to year,Germany had all the expansion she needed. All the economic reasonsyou mention are no good at all; they don’t explain that phenomenon. Itwas simply the time when that thing had to happen from unknown psy-chical reasons. Any great movement of man has always started from psy-chical reasons; so it is our experience that has taught us to believe in thepsychical. Therefore we are rightly afraid of mob psychology, for in-stance. Every man of today will take that into account. And formerly mandid not believe in the value of advertising; now look what is done withit! Or would anybody have believed that the little sheets which appearedevery fortnight—gazettes, which we now call newspapers—would bea world power? The press is recognized as a world power today; it is apsychical fact.So we can say that our civilization has reached the state ofanvhata—wehave overcome the diaphragm. We no longer locate the mind in the dia-phragm, as the Old Greeks did in Homeric times. We are convinced thatthe seat of consciousness must be somewhere up in the head. We alreadyhave a more farsighted view inanvhata; we become aware of thepuruüa.But we do not yet trust the security of psychical existence, so we have notreachedviçuddha. We still believe in a material world built of matter andpsychical force. And we cannot connect the psychical existence or sub-stance with the idea of anything cosmic or physical. We have not yetfound the bridge between the ideas of physics and psychology.4Therefore collectively we have not crossed the distance between4Jung attempted such a bridge in his collaboration with the physicist Wolfgang Pauli inThe Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche(Bollingen Series LI,1955).

So if one speaks ofviçuddha, it is of course with acertain hesitation. We are stepping into the slippery future right awaywhen we try to understand what that might mean. For inviçuddhawereach beyond our actual conception of the world, in a way we reach theether region. We are trying something that would be more than Profes-sor Piccard achieved!5He was only in the stratosphere—he reachedsomething exceedingly thin, I admit, but it was not yet ether. So we haveto construct a sort of skyrocket of very large dimensions which shoots usup into space. It is the world of abstract ideas and values, the worldwhere the psyche is in itself, where the psychical reality is the only reality,or where matter is a thin skin around an enormous cosmos of psychicalrealities, really the illusory fringe around the real existence, which ispsychical.The concept of the atom, for instance, might be considered as corre-sponding to the abstract thinking of theviçuddhacenter. Moreover, ifour experience should reach such a level, we would get an extraordinaryvista of thepuruüa. For then thepuruüabecomes really the center ofthings; it is no longer a pale vision, it is the ultimate reality, as it were. Yousee, that world will be reached when we succeed in finding a symbolicalbridge between the most abstract ideas of physics and the most abstractideas of analytical psychology. If we can construct that bridge then wewill have reached at least the outer gate ofviçuddha. That is the condi-tion. I mean, we will then have reached it collectively; the way will thenbe opened. But we are still a long distance from that goal. Forviçuddhameans just what I said: a full recognition of the psychical essences orsubstances as the fundamental essences of the world, and by virtue not ofspeculation but of fact, namely asexperience. It does not help to speculateaboutvjñvandsahasrvra6and God knows what; you can reflect uponthose things, but you are not there if you have not had the experience.I will give you an example of the transition from one state to another.5Auguste Piccard was a Swiss professor of physics at the University of Brussels. Com-mencing on27May1931, he ascended for the first time into the stratosphere by means ofa special balloon to make scientific observations. His second flight was from the Dübendorfaerodrome near Zurich on18August1932. See hisAu dessus des nuages(Above the clouds)(Paris,1933)andBetween Earth and Sky, translated by C. Apcher (London,1950).6Hauer stated that thesahasrvracakra “is the thousand-spoked or the thousand-petaledcakra” (HS,69). Eliade noted that “it is here that the final union (unmanz)ofåiva andåakti,the final goal of tantricsvdhana, is realized, and here thekuõìalinzends its journey aftertraversing the sixcakras. We should note that thesahasrvrano longer belongs to the planeof the body, that it already designates the plane of transcendence—and this explains whywriters usually speak of the ‘six’cakras.” In Mircea Eliade,Yoga: Immortality and Freedom,translated by Willard R. Trask (Bollingen Series LVI; reprint, London,1989),243.47"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"LECTURE 3I remember the case of a man who was an extrovert in the most exagger-ated sense of the word. He was always convinced that the world was bestwherever he was not; there was the real bliss, and he must make for it.Naturally he was after women all the time, because always the womenwhom he did not yet know contained the secret of life and bliss. Hecould never see a woman in the street talking to another man withoutbeing envious, because that might be the woman. Of course, he neversucceeded, as you can imagine. He succeeded less and less, and he madea perfect fool of himself. He grew older, and the chances of meeting theultimate woman became exceedingly small. So the time came for a newrealization. He got into analysis, but nothing changed until the followingthing happened: he was walking in the street and a young couple camealong talking intimately, and instantly there was pain in his heart—thatwas the woman! Then suddenly the pain vanished, and for a moment hehad an absolutely clear vision. He realized: “Well, they will do it, they aregoing on, the thing is taken care of, I have not to take care of it anylonger, thank heaven!”Now, what happened? Simply that he crossed the threshold of the dia-phragm, for inmaõipÖraone is blind in passion. Of course, when he seessuch a couple he thinks, “I want it, I am identical with that man.” And heisidentical inmaõipÖra. He is identical with every buffalo, and naturallyhe complains when he cannot jump out of his skin and into the skin ofsomebody else. But here he suddenly realizes that he is not that man; hebreaks through the veil of illusion, that mystical identity, and knows thathe is not that fellow. Yet he has an inkling that he is in a peculiar wayidentical with him, that man is himself continuing life; he is not castaside. For his substance is not only his personal self but the substance ofthat young man, too. He himself lives on, and the thing is taken care of.And he is in it, he is not out of it.You see, that is a picture of psychical existence over or beyond themaõipÖraform. It is nothing but a thought—nothing has changed in thevisible world; not one atom is in a different place from before. But onething has changed: the psychical substance has entered the game. Yousee, a mere thought, or almost an indescribable feeling, apsychical fact,changes his whole situation, his whole life, and he can step across toanvhata, to the world where psychical things begin.Now, going fromanvhatatoviçuddhais quite analogous, but it goesvery much further. You see, inanvhatathought and feeling are identicalwith objects. For a man, feeling is identical with a certain woman, forinstance, and for a woman with that particular man. The thought of a48"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932scientist is identical with such-and-such a book. It is such a book. So thereare always external conditions, either for the feeling or for the mind.Thought is always specific—scientific, philosophic, or aesthetic, for ex-ample—because it is always identical with a particular object. And sofeeling is identical with certain people or things. It is because somebodyhas done so-and-so that one is angry, because there are such-and-suchconditions. Therefore our emotions, our values, our thoughts, our con-victions are interdependent with facts, with what we call objects. Theyare not in themselves or through themselves. They are, as I say, inter-woven with concrete facts.You know, it is sometimes an ideal not to have any kind of convictionsor feelings that are not based upon reality. One must even educate peo-ple, when they have to cross frommaõipÖratoanvhata, that their emo-tions ought to have a real basis, that they cannot swear hell and damna-tion at somebody on a mere assumption, and that there are absolutereasons why they are not justified in doing such a thing. They really haveto learn that their feelings should be based on facts.But to cross fromanvhatatoviçuddhaone should unlearn all that. Oneshould even admit that all one’s psychical facts have nothing to do withmaterial facts. For instance, the anger which you feel for somebody orsomething, no matter how justified it is, is not caused by those externalthings. It is a phenomenon all by itself. That is what we call taking a thingon its subjective level. Say somebody has offended you, and you dream ofthat person and feel again the same anger in the dream. Then I say,“That dream tells me just what the anger means, what it is in reality.” Butyou contend that the person had said such-and-such a thing, so you areperfectly justified in feeling such anger and assuming such an attitudetoward him. Well, I must admit all that to be perfectly true, and then Ihumbly say, “Now, when you have had your anger and are reasonableagain, let us consider this dream, for there is a subjective stage of inter-pretation. You consider that man to be your specificbête noire, but he isreally yourself. You project yourself into him, your shadow appears inhim, and that makes you angry. Naturally one is not inclined to admitsuch a possibility, but after a while, when the process of analysis is effec-tive, it dawns upon one that it is most probably true. We are perhapsidentical even with our own worst enemy. In other words, our worstenemy is perhaps within ourselves.If you have reached that stage, you begin to leaveanvhata, because youhave succeeded in dissolving the absolute union of material externalfacts with internal or psychical facts. You begin to consider the game of49"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"LECTURE 3the world as your game, the people that appear outside as exponents ofyour psychical condition. Whatever befalls you, whatever experience oradventure you have in the external world, is your own experience.For instance, an analysis does not depend upon what the analyst is. Itis your own experience. What you experience in analysis is not due tome; it is what you are. You will have exactly that experience with mewhich is your own experience. Not everybody falls in love with me, noteverybody takes offense when I make a caustic remark, and not every-body admires a very drastic expression I use. The experience in analysis,in which I am always the same Dr. Jung, is a very different procedure withdifferent people. Individuals are very different, and on account of that,analysis is always a different experience, even to myself. I am the one whois equal to myself in all such conditions, but the patients vary, and ac-cordingly the experience of analysis varies to me all the time. But natu-rally the patient believes that his analysis is so-and-so because I am in it.He does not see that it is also his subjective experience. As long as thepatient looks at analysis in such a way—that it is merely a personal flirta-tion or a personal discussion—he has not gained what he ought to havegained out of it, because he has not seen himself. When he really beginsto see it as his own experience, then he realizes that Dr. Jung, the partnerin the game, is only relative. He is what the patient thinks of him. He issimply a hook on which you are hanging your garment; he is not so sub-stantial as he seems to be. He is also your subjective experience.If you can see that, you are on your way toviçuddha, because inviçuddhathe whole game of the world becomes your subjective experi-ence. The world itself becomes a reflection of the psyche. For instance,when I say that the world consists of psychical images only—that what-ever you touch, whatever you experience, is imaged because you cannotperceive anything else; that if you touch this table, you might think itsubstantial, but what you really experience is a peculiar message fromthe tactile nerves to your brain; and even this you may not experiencebecause I can cut off your fingers, you still experience your fingers onlybecause the cut-off nerves cannot function in any other way; and yourbrain even is also only an image up here—when I say such a hereticalthing I am on the way toviçuddha. If I should succeed—and I hope I shallnot—in taking all of you up toviçuddha, you would certainly complain;you would stifle, you would not be able to breathe any longer, becausethere is nothing you could possibly breathe. It is ether. In reachingviçuddha, you reach the airless space, where there is no earthly chancefor the ordinary individual to breathe. So it seems to be a very criticalkind of adventure.50"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932Now, in talking about these centers, we must never omit the actualsymbols; they teach us a great deal. I want to call your attention to theanimal symbolism of which I have not yet spoken. You know that theseries of animals begins inmÖlvdhvrawith the elephant that supports theearth, meaning that tremendous urge which supports human conscious-ness, the power that forces us to build such a conscious world. To theHindu the elephant functions as the symbol of the domesticated libido,parallel to the image of the horse with us. It means the force of con-sciousness, the power of will, the ability to do what one wants to do.In the next center is the makara, the leviathan. So in crossing frommÖlvdhvratosvvdhiü°hvna, the power that has nourished you hithertoshows now an entirely different quality: what is the elephant on the sur-face of the world is the leviathan in the depths. The elephant is the big-gest, strongest animal upon the surface of the earth, and the leviathan isthe biggest and most terrible animal down in the waters. But it is one andthe same animal: the power that forces you into consciousness and thatsustains you in your conscious world proves to be the worst enemy whenyou come to the next center. For there you are really going out of thisworld, and everything that makes you cling to it is your worst enemy. Thegreatest blessing in this world is the greatest curse in the unconscious. Sothe makara is just the reverse: the water elephant, the whale dragon thatdevours you, is the thing that has nourished and supported you hith-erto—just as the benevolent mother that brought you up becomes inlater life a devouring mother that swallows you again. If you cannot giveher up she becomes an absolutely negative factor—she supports the lifeof your childhood and youth, but to become adult you must leave allthat, and then the mother force is against you. So anyone attempting toleave this world for another kind of consciousness, the water world or theunconscious, has the elephant against him; then the elephant becomesthe monster of the underworld.InmaõipÖrathe ram is the symbolic animal, and the ram is the sacredanimal of Agni, the god of fire. That is astrological. The ram, Aries, is thedomicilium of Mars, the fiery planet of passions, impulsiveness, rashness,violence, and so on. Agni is an apt symbol. It is again the elephant, butin a new form. And it is no longer an insurmountable power—the sacredpower of the elephant. It is now a sacrificial animal, and it is a relativelysmall sacrifice—not the great sacrifice of the bull but the smaller sacri-fice of the passions. That is, to sacrifice the passions is not so terriblyexpensive. The small black animal that is against you is no longer like theleviathan of the depths in the cakra before; the danger has already di-minished.

And that is expressed by Aries, the ram; it isa small sacrificial animal of which you don’t need to be afraid, for it is nolonger equipped with the strength of the elephant or the leviathan. Youhave overcome the worst danger when you are aware of your fundamen-tal desires or passions.The next animal is the gazelle, again a transformation of the originalforce. The gazelle or antelope is not unlike the ram, living upon thesurface of the earth—the difference being that it is not a domesticatedanimal like the male sheep, nor is it a sacrificial animal. It is not at alloffensive; it is exceedingly shy and elusive, on the contrary, and very fleetof foot—it vanishes in no time. When you come upon a herd of gazelles,you are always amazed at the way they disappear. They just fly into spacewith great leaps. There are antelopes in Africa that take leaps of six to tenmeters—something amazing; it is as if they had wings. And they are alsograceful and tender, and have exceedingly slender legs and feet. Theyhardly touch the ground, and the least stirring of the air is sufficient tomake them fly away, like birds. So there is a birdlike quality in the ga-zelle. It is as light as air; it touches the earth only here and there. It is ananimal of earth, but it is almost liberated from the power of gravity. Suchan animal would be apt to symbolize the force, the efficiency, and thelightness of psychical substance—thought and feeling. It has already losta part of the heaviness of the earth. Also, it denotes that inanvhatathepsychical thing is an elusive factor, hardly to be caught. It has exactly thequality that we doctors would mean when we say that it is exceedinglydifficult to discover the psychogenic factor in a disease.Mr. Dell:Would you compare it also to the unicorn?Dr. Jung:I would say it is a close analogy, and you know the unicorn isa symbol of the Holy Ghost—that would be a Western equivalent.7Mrs. Sawyer:The unicorn derives from the rhinoceros, so that wouldalso be an analogy.Dr. Jung:Yes, the rhinoceros has survived in the legend of the unicorn.The unicorn is not a real animal, but the rhinoceros has been a very realanimal in this country. For instance, one half of a rhinoceros has beenfound, well preserved, in an oil pit somewhere in Eastern Europe—Ithink in Poland. It was of the glacial period, a European rhinoceros. Sothe unicorn is most probably a faint echo of those days when man saw theactual rhinoceros here. Of course, one cannot prove it, but it is at least7Jung gave an extended commentary on the symbolic significance of the unicorn inPsychology and Alchemy,inCW, vol.12,§§518–54.52"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932a very nice analogy to our process here—the transformation of the ele-phant into this tender, gentle, light-footed gazelle.Now, that is a very apt symbol of the psychogenic factor. And the dis-covery of the psychogenic factor in medicine was really something youcould compare with the crossing frommaõipÖratoanvhata. I remembervery well the time when professors said: “Well, there is some psychic dis-turbance too, naturally imagination has something to do with it, and anupset psychology can produce all sorts of symptoms,” and so on. It wasthought originally that the psyche was some sort of foam or essence, pro-duced by the body, and nothing in itself, and that so-called psychologicalcausality did not really exist, that it was more symptomatic. Not evenFreud takes the psychogenic factor as substantial. The psyche for him issomething rather physiological, a sort of byplay in the life of the body.He is convinced that there is a lot of chemistry in it, or ought to be—thatthe whole thing goes back to the chemistry of the body, that it ishormones or God knows what. So thediscovery of a real psychogenicfactor (which is not yet realized in medicine, please!) is a great and tale-telling event. It would be the recognition of the psyche itself as some-thing that of course functions together with the body, but which has thedignity of a cause. You see, if a doctor admits such a thing he is goingreally a long way. If he puts the psychogenic factor, as causal, amongmicrobes, colds, unfavorable social conditions, heredity, and so on, withthat he recognizes the psyche as something that does exist and has actualeffect. The logical medical mind does not quite trust whether it is reallysomething you could lay hands on, for it has that elusive quality of thegazelle. And you know that when the psyche manifests itself in reality, itis usually against us. For inasmuch as it is not against us, it is simply iden-tical with our consciousness. Our consciousness is not against us, and weconsider everything to be our own conscious doing, but the psychic fac-tor is always something that we assume to be not our doing. We try todeny it and to repress it. Say I want to write a letter that is disagreeable tome. Then immediately I have the psychic factor against me. I am not ableto find that letter—it has been spirited away; I discover that I have mis-laid it unconsciously. I wanted to take particular care of that letter, butbecause I have resistances against it I put it in the wrong pocket or in acorner where I shall not find it for months. One is inclined to speak ofan imp that has busied himself with it. One feels something demoniacalin the way just the things one painfully needs are spirited away. The samething occurs in hysteria: just where it would matter, things take a queercourse. Where it is very important that one should say the right thing,one says just the wrong thing; one’s words are turned in one’s mouth. So53"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"LECTURE 3one cannot help recognizing the fact that some living devil is againstone. Thus the old idea that such people were possessed by devils, werethe victims of witches, and so forth.Mr. Baumann:There is a very good book by Friedrich Theodor Vis-cher,Auch Einer(Also one).8Dr. Jung:Yes, a German book about one of those who know aboutthings, that is, the imp in objects. For instance, when you lose your spec-tacles you will always lose them in an unlikely place, perhaps upon achair of such a design that the spectacles fit in perfectly. And you can beabsolutely sure that when you drop a piece of buttered toast on the floorit will always fall on the buttered side. Or when you are putting yourcoffeepot upon the table, it will try by all means to put its spout throughthe handle of the milk pot, so that you spill the milk when you lift thepot.Mr. Dell: Die Tücke des Objekts(the malice of objects).Dr. Jung:Yes, the devilish cunning of objects, and Vischer made awhole system of that inAuch Einer. It is exceedingly quixotic naturally,but he gets the psychic factor all right, because it is in a way our doing,and yet it is not our doing; it happens in an impish way. The elusivenessof the psychogenic factor is amazing. In analysis also it is always escaping,because wherever you try to attack it the patient denies it and says, “Butthat is what I wanted to do; that is myself.” He keeps it out of the way allthe time because he himself is afraid to discover it. He is afraid that ascrew is loose somewhere in his head; he thinks it would mean that hewas mad.So the crossing-over frommaõipÖratoanvhatais really very difficult.The recognition that the psyche is a self-moving thing, something genu-ine and not yourself, is exceedingly difficult to see and to admit. For itmeans that the consciousness which you call yourself is at an end. In yourconsciousness everything is as you have put it, but then you discover thatyou are not master in your own house, you are not living alone in yourown room, and there are spooks about that play havoc with your realities,and that is the end of your monarchy. But if you understand it rightly,and as tantric yoga shows you, this recognition of the psychogenic factoris merely the first recognition of thepuruüa. It is the beginning of thegreat recognition appearing in the most grotesque and ridiculous forms.You see, that is what the gazelle signifies.Now you remember the elephant appears inviçuddhaagain. So herewe encounter the full power, the insurmountable sacred strength of the8Friedrich Theodor Vischer,Auch Einer, (Stuttgart and Leipzig,1884).54"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932animal as it was inmÖlvdhvra. That is, we meet there all the power whichled us into life, into this conscious reality. But here it is not supportingmÖlvdhvra, this earth. It is supporting those things which we assume to bethe most airy, the most unreal, and the most volatile, namely, humanthoughts. It is as if the elephant were now making realities out of con-cepts. We admit that our concepts are nothing but our imagination,products of our feeling or of our intellect—abstractions or analogies,sustained by no physical phenomena.The thing that unites them all, that expresses them all, is the conceptof energy. In philosophy, for instance, take the example of Plato in hisparable of the cave.9He tries by that rather clumsy parable to explain thesubjectivity of our judgment, which is really the same idea which wascalled later on in the history of philosophy the theory of cognition. Hedescribes people sitting in a cave with their backs against the light, look-ing at the shadows on the wall, cast by the moving figures outside. Now,this is an exceedingly apt parable to explain the problem, but it neededmore than two thousand years until that problem was formulated in aphilosophically abstract way in Kant’sCritique of Pure Reason.We always have the impression that such philosophical or scientificconcepts as energy—call them theories or hypotheses—are perfectly fu-tile things that change tomorrow, like a breath of air that has no exis-tence whatever. Yet these are apparently the things sustained andpushed by the elephant, as if the elephant were making a reality of suchconcepts which are really the mere products of our mind. That is ourprejudice—tothinkthat those products are not also realities.But here is the hitch in the whole thing, this is not so simple. Yourspeculations lead to abstractions, and these abstractions you very clearlyfeel to be merely your conclusions. They are artificial; you are never surethat they do exist in reality. But if perchance you should experience inreality what you have concluded, then you say, “Now this is real, insofaras my thought is real.” For example, you say, “Tomorrow we shall have athunderstorm.” It is not very likely at this time of the year, but from allthe meteorological data you make that conclusion though you yourselfthink it rather improbable. And tomorrow we do actually have a thun-derstorm, and then you say, “Is it not marvelous that I came to such aconclusion? My feeling must be right.” So you substantiate your thinkingin reality, and this reality affects the whole man. It affects you throughand through—you get drenched by the rain, you hear the thunder, andyou may be struck by the lightning—you get the whole thing.9Plato,The Republic, book7, translated by D. Lee (London,1955),514ff.55"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"LECTURE 3Now, according to the symbolism of the cakras something similar hap-pens inviçuddha. The power of the elephant is lent to psychic realities,which our reason would like to consider as mere abstractions. But thepower of the elephant is never lent to products of the mere intellectbecause they are never convincing; they always need physical evidence.And for purely psychical things, there is no possibility of anything likephysical evidence. For instance, you know that it is impossible in physicalfact ever to make a concept of God, because it is not a physical concept.It has nothing to do with an experience in space and time. It has simplyno connection with space and time, and therefore you cannot expectany such subsequent effect. But if you have the psychicalexperience,ifthepsychical fact forces itself upon you, then you understand it, and you canthen make a concept of it. The abstraction, or the concept of God, hascome out of experience. It is not your intellectual concept, though it canbe intellectual too. But the main thing in such an experience is that it isa psychical fact. And psychical facts are the reality inviçuddha. Thereforethe insurmountable force of reality is sustaining no longer the data ofthis earth but psychical data.For example, you know that you would like to do something verymuch, but you feel it is simply not to be, as if there were an absoluteinterdiction. Or you feel very strongly that you don’t want to do a certainthing, yet the psychical factor demands it, and you know there is no de-fense—you must go that way; there is no hesitation about it. That is thepower of the elephant, which you feel perhaps even in what you wouldcall absurdities. Those are the experiences of the reality ofviçuddhaasexpressed by the symbolism.That is only the fifth cakra, and we are already out of breath—literallyso—we are beyond the air we breathe; we are reaching, say, into the re-mote future of mankind, or of ourselves. For any man has at least thepotential faculty to experience that which will be the collective experi-ence in two thousand years, perhaps in ten thousand years. What we aredealing with today has already been we don’t know how many millions oftimes before in dim ages of the past by primitive medicine men, or by oldRomans or Greeks—it has all been anticipated. And we anticipate thou-sands of years to come, so we really reach out into a future which we donot yet possess. Therefore it is rather bold to speak of the sixth cakra,10which is naturally completely beyond our reach, because we have not10Of thevjñvcakra, Hauer stated: “The god, man power, has disappeared at this stage,but a differentiated woman power is still working, and disappears only in the last cakra. Iam not sure whether you will find psychological parallels for that” (HS,90).56"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932even arrived atviçuddha. But since we have that symbolism we can at leastconstruct something theoretical about it.Thevjñvcenter, you remember, looks like a winged seed, and it con-tains no animal. That means there is no psychical factor, nothing againstus whose power we might feel. The original symbol, theli ́ga, is hererepeated in a new form, the white state. Instead of the dark germinatingcondition, it is now in the full blazing white light, fully conscious. Inother words, the God that has been dormant inmÖlvdhvrais here fullyawake, the only reality; and therefore this center has been called the con-dition in which one unites withåiva. One could say it was the center oftheunio mysticawith the power of God, meaning that absolute realitywhere one is nothing but psychic reality, yet confronted with the psychicreality that one is not. And that is God. God is the eternal psychical ob-ject. God is simply a word for the non-ego. Inviçuddhapsychical realitywas still opposed to physical reality. Therefore one still used the supportof the white elephant to sustain the reality of the psyche. Psychical factsstill took place within us, although they had a life of their own.But in thevjñvcenter the psyche gets wings—here you know you arenothing but psyche. And yet there is another psyche, a counterpart toyour psychical reality, the non-ego reality, the thing that is not even to becalled self, and you know that you are going to disappear into it. The egodisappears completely; the psychical is no longer a content in us, but webecome contents of it. You see that this condition in which the whiteelephant has disappeared into the self is almost unimaginable. He is nolonger perceptible even in his strength because he is no longer againstyou. You are absolutely identical with him. You are not even dreaming ofdoing anything other than what the force is demanding, and the force isnot demanding it since you are already doing it—since you are the force.And the force returns to the origin, God.To speak about the lotus of the thousand petals above, thesahasrvracenter, is quite superfluous because that is merely a philosophical con-cept with no substance to us whatever; it is beyond any possible experi-ence. Invjñvthere is still the experience of the self that is apparentlydifferent from the object, God. But insahasrvraone understands that itis not different, and so the next conclusion would be that there is noobject, no God, nothing but brahman. There is no experience becauseit is one, it is without a second. It is dormant, it is not, and therefore it isnirvvõa. This is an entirely philosophical concept, a mere logical conclu-sion from the premises before. It is without practical value for us.Mrs. Sawyer:I would like to ask you if the Eastern idea of going up57"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"LECTURE 3through the cakras means that each time you have reached a new centeryou have to return tomÖlvdhvra?Dr. Jung:As long as you live you are inmÖlvdhvranaturally. It is quiteself-evident that you cannot always live in meditation, or in a trance con-dition. You have to go about in this world; you have to be conscious andlet the gods sleep.Mrs. Sawyer:Yes, but you could think of it in two ways: as doing all thesethings together, or as making a trip up and down.Dr. Jung:The cakra symbolism has the same meaning that is expressedin our metaphors of the night sea-journey, or climbing a sacred moun-tain, or initiation. It is really a continuous development. It is not leapingup and down, for what you have arrived at is never lost. Say you havebeen inmÖlvdhvraand then you reach the water center, and afterwardyou return apparently. But you do not return; it is an illusion that youreturn—you have left something of yourself in the unconscious. Nobodytouches the unconscious without leaving something of himself there.You may forget or repress it, but then you are no longer whole. Whenyou have learned that two times two makes four, it will be so in all eter-nity—it will never be five. Only those people return who thought theytouched it but were only full of illusions about it. If you have really expe-rienced it, you cannot lose this experience. It is as if so much of yoursubstance had remained, so much of your blood and weight. You canreturn to the previous condition, forgetting that you have lost a leg, butyour leg has been bitten off by the leviathan. Many people who got intothe water say, “Never shall I go there again!” But they left something,something has stayed there. And if you get through the water and intothe fire of passion, you never can really turn back, because you cannotlose the connection with your passion that you have gained inmaõipÖra.Question:Is it like Wotan, who loses one eye?Dr. Jung:Exactly. And like Osiris, the god of the underworld, who alsoloses one eye. Wotan has to sacrifice his one eye to the well of Mimir, thewell of wisdom, which is the unconscious. You see, one eye will remain inthe depths or turned toward it.11Thus Jakob Boehme, when he was “en-chanted into the center of nature,” as he says, wrote his book about the“reversed eye.” One of his eyes was turned inward; it kept on looking intothe underworld—which amounts to the loss of one eye. He had nolonger two eyes for this world. So when you have actually entered ahigher cakra you never really turn back; you remain there. Part of you11For Jung’s analysis of Wotan, in which he does not specifically deal with this motif, see“Wotan” (1936), inCW, vol.10.58"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"26 OCTOBER 1932can split off, but the farther you have reached into the series of thecakras, the more expensive will be the apparent return. Or if you return,having lost the memory of the connection with that center, then you arelike a wraith. In reality you are just nothing, a mere shadow, and yourexperiences remain empty.Mrs. Crowley:Do you think the idea is to experience those cakras,which one has gone through, simultaneously?Dr. Jung:Certainly. As I told you, in our actual historical psychologicaldevelopment we have about reachedanvhataand from there we canexperiencemÖlvdhvra, and all the subsequent centers of the past, byknowledge of records, and tradition, and also through our unconscious.Suppose somebody reached thevjñvcenter, the state of complete con-sciousness, not only self-consciousness. That would be an exceedinglyextended consciousness which includes everything—energy itself—aconsciousness which knows not only “That is Thou” but more thanthat—every tree, every stone, every breath of air, every rat’s tail—all thatis yourself; there is nothing that is not yourself. In such an extended con-sciousness all the cakras would be simultaneously experienced, becauseit is the highest state of consciousness, and it would not be the highest ifit did not include all the former experiences.59"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"LECTURE 412November1932Dr. Jung:We have here a question from Mr. Allemann:I do not understand why our daily life should be thought of as tak-ing place solely inmÖlvdhvra. Would notmÖlvdhvraapply more tothe life of animals and primitives who live in complete harmonywith nature? Should we not rather consider our cultivated life underthesthÖlaaspect of the higher cakras? The awakening of the Kun-dalini would then be similar to the conscious understanding of thesÖkümaaspect. That would mean: in order to awaken Kundalini wemust go down to the roots of things, to the “mothers,” and first of allunderstand consciously the sÖküma aspect ofmÖlvdhvra, the earth.Mr. Allemann has brought up a very complicated problem. I understandhis difficulties because they represent the difficulties of our Westernstandpoint when it is confronted with Eastern ideas. We are confrontedwith a paradox: for us consciousness is located high up, in thevjñvcakra,so to speak, and yetmÖlvdhvra, our reality, lies in the lowest cakra. Be-sides this, another apparent contradiction strikes us:mÖlvdhvrais, as wehave seen, our world. How can it then be located in the pelvis as it is inthe cakra system?I will try once again to give a general explanation of how we are tounderstand this, but for the moment we must keep quite separate thesymbolismof the cakras and thephilosophyof thesthÖla-sÖkümaaspect ofthings. The three aspects covered by the termssthÖla,sÖküma,andparvare a philosophical way of looking at things. From the standpoint of the-ory, each cakra can be regarded from all three aspects. The cakras how-ever, aresymbols. They bring together in image form complex and mani-fold ideas of ideas and facts.The word symbol comes from the Greek wordsymballein, to throw to-gether. It has to do, then, with things gathered together, or with a heap of1[Note to the1932edition: This lecture was arranged by Miss Wolff for the report of theGerman seminar, with additional material from Dr. Jung. It is translated by Mrs. Baynes.]60"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"2 NOVEMBER 1932material thrown together, which we, as the expression shows, take as awhole. We could translate the word symbol as “something viewed as a total-ity,” or as “the vision of things brought into a whole.” We must always haverecourse to a symbol when we are dealing with a great variety of aspects orwith a multiplicity of things which form a connected unit and which are soclosely woven together in all their separate parts that we cannot separateor take away any parts without destroying the connections and losing themeaning of the totality. Modern philosophy has formulated this way oflooking at things under what is known asGestalttheory.2A symbol, then,is a livingGestalt, or form—the sum total of a highly complex set of factswhich our intellect cannot master conceptually, and which therefore can-not be expressed in any way other than by the use of an image.Take, for example, the problem of knowledge, which has presenteddifficulties so great and so manifold as to occupy thinkers from the timewhen philosophy first developed down to the present moment. Plato, forinstance, never got as far as formulating an adequate theory of the prob-lem of knowledge; he could not go beyond the image of the cave, andhad to describe the problem in terms of a vision or concrete image. Twothousand years had to pass before Kant could formulate a theory ofknowledge.So, too, the cakras are symbols. They symbolize highly complex psy-chic facts which at the present moment we could not possibly expressexcept in images. The cakras are therefore of great value to us becausethey represent a real effort to give a symbolic theory of the psyche. Thepsyche is something so highly complicated, so vast in extent, and so richin elements unknown to us, and its aspects overlap and interweave withone another in such an amazing degree, that we always turn to symbolsin order to try to represent what we know about it. Any theory about itwould be premature because it would become entangled in particulari-ties and would lose sight of the totality we set out to envisage.You have seen from my attempt at an analysis of the cakras how diffi-cult it is to reach their content, and with what complex conditions wehave to deal when we are studying not just consciousness but the totalityof the psyche. The cakras, then, become a valuable guide for us in thisobscure field because the East, and India especially, has always tried tounderstand the psyche as a whole. It has an intuition of the self, andtherefore it sees the ego and consciousness as only more or less unessen-tial parts of the self. All this seems very strange to us: it appears to us asthough India were fascinated by the background of consciousness, be-cause we ourselves are entirely identified with our foreground, with the2See Kurt Koffka,Principles of Gestalt Psychology(New York,1935).61"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"LECTURE 4conscious. But now, among us, too, the background, or hinterland, ofthe psyche has come to life, and since it is so obscure and so difficult toaccess, we are at first forced to represent it symbolically. Thus, for exam-ple, there comes to our notice the paradoxical situation in whichmÖlv-dhvrais localized in the pelvis and at the same time represents our world,and this paradox can be expressed only by a symbol. It is the same withthe apparent contradiction contained in the fact that we think of con-sciousness as located in our heads, andnonetheless we live in the lowestcakra, inmÖlvdhvra.As we have seen in the first English seminar of this autumn,mÖlvdhvrais the symbol of our present psychic situation, because we live entangledin earthly causalities.3It represents the entanglement and dependenceof our conscious lifeas it actually is.mÖlvdhvrais not just the outer worldas we live in it; it is our total consciousness of all outer and inner personalexperiences. In our conscious life of everyday we are like highly devel-oped animals, tied down by our environment and entangled and condi-tioned by it. But our Western consciousness does not look at it this wayat all. In our world, on the contrary, we are living in the upper centers.Our consciousness is localized in the head; we feel it to be there; wethink and will in our heads. We are the lords of nature, and we havecommand over the environmental conditions and the blind laws thatbind primitive man hand and foot. In our consciousness we sit en-throned on high and look down upon nature and animals. To us archaicman is Neanderthal man, little better than an animal. We do not see inthe very least that God appears as an animal also. To us animal means“bestial.” What should really seem above us seems to be below us and istaken as something regressive and degraded. Therefore we “go downinto”svvdhiü°hvnaor “fall into” the emotionality ofmaõipÖra. Because weare identified with the consciousness we talk about the subconscious.When we go into the unconscious we descend to a lower level. Thereforewe can say that humanity in general has reached the level of theanvhatacakra insofar as it feels itself bound by the suprapersonal values ofanvhata. All culture creates suprapersonal values. A thinker whose ideasshow an activity that is independent of the events of daily life could saythat he is in theviçuddha, or almost in thevjñvcenter.But all that is only thesthÖlaaspect of the problem. ThesthÖlaaspectis the personal aspect. To us personally, it seems as if we were in thehigher centers. We think that because our consciousness and the collec-tive suprapersonal culture in which we live are in theanvhatacenter, we3The seminar on visions had resumed earlier the same day. For Jung’s comments onmulvdhvra, seeThe Visions Seminarvol.7,10.62"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"2 NOVEMBER 1932are there in all respects. Being identified with the conscious, we do notsee that there exists something outside it and that this something is notabove but below.But by means of psychology or tantric philosophy we can achieve astandpoint from which we can observe that suprapersonal events do takeplace within our own psyche. To look at things from a suprapersonalstandpoint is to arrive at thesÖkümaaspect. We can attain this standpointbecause inasmuch as we create culture, we create suprapersonal values,and when we do this, we begin to see thesÖkümaaspect. Through culturewe get an intuition of the other than personal psychological possibilitiesbecause the suprapersonal appears in it. The cakra system manifests it-self in culture, and culture can therefore be divided into various levelssuch as that of the belly, heart, and head centers. Therefore we can expe-rience and demonstrate the various centers as they appear in the life ofthe individual, or in the evolution of humanity. We begin in the head; weidentify with our eyes and our consciousness: quite detached and objec-tive, we survey the world. That isvjñv. But we cannot linger forever in thepure spheres of detached observation, we must bring our thoughts intoreality. We voice them and so trust them to the air. When we clothe ourknowledge in words, we are in the region ofviçuddha, or the throat cen-ter. But as soon as we say something that is especially difficult, or thatcauses us positive or negative feelings, we have a throbbing of the heart,andthentheanvhatacenter begins to be activated. And still another stepfurther, when for example a dispute with someone starts up, when wehave become irritable and angry and get beside ourselves, then we are inmaõipÖra.If we go lower still, the situation becomes impossible, because then thebodybegins to speak. For this reason, in England, everything below thediaphragm is taboo. Germans always go a little below it and hence easilybecome emotional. Russians live altogether below the diaphragm—theyconsist of emotions. French and Italiansbehaveas if they were below it butthey know perfectly well, and so does everyone else, that they are not.It is a rather delicate and painful matter to speak of what happens insvvdhiü°hvna. When for example, an emotion reaches a point of greatintensity, it no longer expresses itself in words, but in a physiological way.It does not leave the body by way of the mouth, but in other ways—as, forinstance, the bladder.Svvdhiü°hvnarepresents the level where psychiclife may be said to begin. Only when this level became activated did man-kind awaken from the sleep ofmÖlvdhvraand learn the first rules of bod-ily decency. The beginning of moral education consisted in attending toour needs in the places suitable for them, just as still happens in theeducation of a small child. Dogs too have learned this; they are already63"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"LECTURE 4living insvvdhiü°hvnainasmuch as they deposit their visiting cards attrees and corners. The dogs that come after read the messages and knowfrom them how the land lies, whether the preceding dog was fed orempty, whether it was a large or a small dog—an important difference inthe breeding season. Thus dogs can give all sorts of news about one an-other and can direct themselves accordingly.This first and lowest means of expressing psychic life is also still used byhuman beings, for instance by very primitive criminals. You know what ismeant bygrumus merdae(mound of excrement). The thief deposits hisexcrement in the place he has looted and says in this way: “This is mysignature; this belongs to me; woe to him who crosses my path.” Thus itbecomes a sort of apotropaic charm—a relic of archaic times. For in prim-itive conditions this sign language actually has a great, even a vital, impor-tance. A person can tell by it whether dangerous or useful animals havemade a given track and whether the track is fresh or not. Naturally thesame thing is true of human tracks; if hostile tribes are in the neighbor-hood, fresh human excrement is a sign of alarm. The more primitive theconditions of life, the more valuable the psychic manifestations of thislevel. We could say it is the first speech of nature. Psychic manifestationsbelonging tosvvdhiü°hvnaare therefore often present in our dreams, andcertain witticisms and the broad jokes of the Middle Ages are full of them.As tomÖlvdhvra, we know nothing about it because at this level psychiclife is dormant. Mr. Allemann is therefore quite correct in saying thatmÖlvdhvrais the life of animals and primitives who live in complete har-mony with nature. Our cultivated life, on the other hand, is to be lookedat as thesthÖlaaspect of the higher cakras. The awakening of Kundaliniwould then be similar to the conscious understanding of thesÖkümaas-pect. That is quite true. But what must we do in order to understandconsciously thesÖkümaaspect ofmÖlvdhvra, or of the earth?Here we meet again the great paradox. In consciousness we are invjñv, and yet we actually live inmÖlvdhvra.ThatisthesthÖlaaspect. Butcan we win another aspect? As we know, we cannot understand a thing ifwe are still immersed in it and identified with it. Only when we reach astandpoint that is “outside” the experience in question, can we whollyunderstand what we were experiencing before. Thus, for example, wecan form an objective judgment of the nation, race, or continent towhich we belong only when we have lived for a time in a foreign countryand so are able to look at our own country from without.How, then, can we put aside our personal standpoint, which repre-sents thesthÖlaaspect, and take another, a suprapersonal one which willshow us where we actually are in this world? How can we find out that weare inmÖlvdhvra?MÖlvdhvrais a condition of psychic sleep, we have said;64"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"2 NOVEMBER 1932we have then no consciousness there and can say nothing about it. Ibegan by saying that by means of culture we create suprapersonal valuesand that by this means we can get an inkling of other psychological possi-bilities and can reach another state of mind. In the creation of supraper-sonal values we begin with thesÖkümaaspect. We see things from thesÖkümaaspect when we create symbols. We can also see our psyche underthesÖkümaaspect, and this is just what the symbols of the cakras are. Norcan I describe this standpoint to you in any way except by means of asymbol. It is as if we viewed our psychology and the psychology of man-kind from the standpoint of a fourth dimension, unlimited by space ortime. The cakra system is created from this standpoint. It is a standpointthat transcends time and the individual.The spiritual point of view of India in general is a standpoint of thissort. Hindus do not begin as we do to explain the world by taking thehydrogen atom as the starting point, nor do they describe the evolutionof mankind or of the individual from lower to higher, from deep uncon-sciousness to the highest consciousness. They do not see humanity underthesthÖlaaspect. They speak only of thesÖkümaaspect and therefore say:“In the beginning was the one brahman without a second. It is the oneindubitable reality, being and not-being.”4They begin insahasrvra;theyspeak the language of the gods and think of man from above down, tak-ing him from thesÖkümaorparvaspect. Inner experience is to them reve-lation; they would never say about this experience “I thought it.”Naturally we see the East quite differently. In comparison with ourconsciousanvhataculture, we can truthfully say that the collective cul-ture of India is inmÖlvdhvra. For proof of this we need only think of theactual conditions of life in India, its poverty, its dirt, its lack of hygiene,its ignorance of scientific and technical achievements. Looked at fromthesthÖlaaspect the collective culture of India really is inmÖlvdhvra,whereas ours has reachedanvhata. But the Indian concept of life under-stands humanity under thesÖkümaaspect, and looked at from that stand-point everything becomes completely reversed. Our personal conscious-ness can indeed be located inanvhataor even invjñv, but nonethelessour psychic situation as a whole is undoubtedly inmÖlvdhvra.Suppose we begin to explain the world in terms ofsahasrvraandstarted off a lecture, for instance, with the words of the Vedanta: “Thisworld in the beginning was brahman solely; since brahman was alone itwas not unfolded. It knew itself only, and it realized: I am brahman. Inthis way it became the universe.” We would rightly be taken for mad, or4Jung provided an extended commentary on brahman inPsychological Types,inCW,vol.6,§§326–47.65"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"LECTURE 4at least it would be thought that we were holding a revival meeting. So ifwe are wise and live in reality, when we want to describe something wealways begin with everyday banal events, and with the practical and con-crete. In a word, we begin with thesthÖlaaspect. To us the things that arereal beyond question are our professions, the places where we live, ourbank accounts, our families and our social connections. We are forced totake these realities as our premises if we want to live at all. Without per-sonal life, without the here and now, we cannot attain to the supraper-sonal. Personal life must first be fulfilled in order that the process of thesuprapersonal side of the psyche can be introduced.What is suprapersonal in us is shown us again and again in the visionsof our seminar: it is an event outside of the ego and of consciousness. Inthe fantasies of our patient we are always dealing with symbols and expe-riences which have nothing to do with her as Mrs. So-and-So but whicharise from the collective human soul in her and which are therefore col-lective contents. In analysis the suprapersonal process can begin onlywhen all the personal life has been assimilated to consciousness. In thisway psychology opens up a standpoint and types of experience that liebeyond ego consciousness. (The same thing happens in tantric philoso-phy, but with this difference: there the ego plays no role at all.) Thisstandpoint and this experience answer the question as to how we can freeourselves from the overwhelming realities of the world, that is, how todisentangle our consciousness from the world. You remember, for exam-ple, the symbol of water and fire, a picture in which the patient stood inflames.5That represents the diving down into the unconscious, into thebaptismal font ofsvvdhiü°hvna, and the suffering of the fire ofmaõipÖra.We now understand that the diving into the water and the enduring ofthe flames is not a descent, not a fall into the lower levels, but an ascent.It is a development beyond the conscious ego, an experience of the per-sonal way into the suprapersonal—a widening of the psychic horizons ofthe individual so as to include what is common to all mankind. When weassimilate the collective unconscious we are not dissolving but creating it.Only after having reached this standpoint—only after having touchedthe baptismal waters ofsvvdhiü°hvna—can we realize that our consciousculture, despite all its heights, is still inmÖlvdhvra. We may have reachedvjñvin our personal consciousness, our race in general can still be inanvhata, but that is all on the personal side still—it is still thesthÖlaas-pect, because it is valid only for our consciousness. And as long as the egois identified with consciousness, it is caught up in this world, the world of5[Note to the1932edition: English seminar print no.27.] Jung had commented on thisimage earlier that day (The Visions Seminarvol.7,11).66"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"2 NOVEMBER 1932themÖlvdhvracakra. But we see that it is so only when we have an experi-ence and achieve a standpoint that transcends consciousness. Only whenwe have become acquainted with the wide extent of the psyche, and nolonger remain inside the confines of the conscious alone, can we knowthat our consciousness is entangled inmÖlvdhvra.The symbols of the cakra, then, afford us a standpoint that extendsbeyond the conscious. They are intuitions about the psyche as a whole,about its various conditions and possibilities. They symbolize the psychefrom a cosmic standpoint. It is as if a superconsciousness, an all-embrac-ing divine consciousness, surveyed the psyche from above. Looked atfrom the angle of this four-dimensional consciousness, we can recognizethe fact that we are still living inmÖlvdhvra.ThatisthesÖkümaaspect.Observed from that angle we ascend when we go into the unconscious,because it frees us from everyday consciousness. In the state of ordinaryconsciousness, we are actually down below, entangled, rooted in theearth under a spell of illusions, dependent—in short, only a little morefree than the higher animals. We have culture, it is true, but our cultureis not suprapersonal; it is culture inmÖlvdhvra. We can indeed developour consciousness until it reaches thevjñvcenter, but ourvjñvis a per-sonalvjñv, and therefore it is inmÖlvdhvra. Nonetheless, we do not knowthat we are inmÖlvdhvra, any more than the American Indians know thatthey are living in America. Ourvjñvis caught in this world. It is a sparkof light, imprisioned in the world, and when we think, we are merelythinking in terms of this world.But the Hindu thinks in terms of the great light. His thinking starts notfrom a personal but from a cosmicvjñv. His thinking begins with thebrahman, and ours with the ego. Our thought starts out with the individ-ual and goes out into the general. The Hindu begins with the generaland works down to the individual. From thesÖkümaaspect everything isreversed. From this aspect we realize that everywhere we are still en-closed within the world of causality, that in terms of the cakra we are not“high up” but absolutely “down below.” We are sitting in a hole, in thepelvis of the world, and ouranvhatacenter isanvhatainmÖlvdhvra. Ourculture represents the conscious held prisoner inmÖlvdhvra. Looked atfrom thesÖkümaaspect, everything is still inmÖlvdhvra.Christianity also is based on thesÖkümaaspect. To it, too, the world isonly a preparation for a higher condition, and the here and now, thestate of being involved in this world, is error and sin. The sacraments andrites of the early church all meant freeing man from the merely personalstate of mind and allowing him to participate symbolically in a highercondition. In the mystery of baptism—the plunge intosvvdhiü°hvna—the“old Adam” dies and the “spiritual man” is born. The transfiguration and67"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"LECTURE 4ascension of Christ is the symbolical representation and anticipation ofthe desired end, that is, being lifted above the personal and into thesuprapersonal. In the old church Christ represents the leader, andhence the promise of what the mystic or initiate could also contain.But to non-Christians of the West, the here and now is the only reality.ThesthÖlaaspect, the rootedness inmÖlvdhvra, must first be fully lived inorder for us to be able to grow beyond it afterward. Before we get thatfar, we are not to know that we are caught inmÖlvdhvra. Only in this waycan we develop our personal consciousness to the level of thevjñvcen-ter, and only in this way can we create culture. It is indeed only a per-sonal culture, as I have said, but behind the culture stands God, the su-prapersonal. And so we attain to thesÖkümaaspect. Only then do we seethat what seemed to us the summit of our endeavor is merely somethingpersonal, merely the light-spark of consciousness. Then we realize thattaken from the standpoint of the psyche as a whole, it is only our per-sonal consciousness that has attainedvjñv, but that we, from the aspectof the cosmic cakra system, are still inmÖlvdhvra.It is best to understand this by a metaphor. You can imagine the cos-mic cakra system as an immense skyscraper whose foundations go deepdown in the earth and contain six cellars, one above the other. Onecould then go from the first up to the sixth cellar, but one would still findoneself in the depths of the earth. This whole cellar system is the cosmicmÖlvdhvra, and we still find ourselves in it even after we have reached thesixth cellar—our personalvjñv. This we have to keep in mind always,otherwise we fall into the mistake made by theosophy and confuse thepersonal with the cosmic, the individual light-spark with the divine light.If we do this we get nowhere; we merely undergo a tremendous inflation.Taken from the standpoint of the cosmic cakra system, then, we cansee that we are still very low down, that our culture is a culture inmÖlvdhvra, only a personal culture where the gods have not yet awak-ened from sleep. Therefore we have to awaken Kundalini in order tomake clear to the individual spark of consciousness the light of the gods.In the thought world and in psychic events we can reach this other stateof mind, we can look at ourselves from thesÖkümaaspect, but then every-thing is reversed. Then we see that we are sitting in a hole and that we donot go down into the unconscious, but that in gaining a relation to theunconscious we undergo a development upward. To activate the uncon-scious means to awaken the divine, thedevz, Kundalini—to begin thedevelopment of the suprapersonal within the individual in order to kin-dle the light of the gods. Kundalini, which is to be awakened in the sleep-ingmÖlvdhvraworld, is the suprapersonal, the non-ego, the totality ofthe psyche through which alone we can attain the higher cakras in a68"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"2 NOVEMBER 1932cosmic or metaphysical sense. For this reason Kundalini is the same prin-ciple as theSoter, the Saviour Serpent of the Gnostics. This way of lookingat the world is thesÖkümaaspect. ThesÖkümaaspect is the inner cosmicmeaning of events—the “subtle body,” the suprapersonal.Theparvaspect, which Professor Hauer called the metaphysical, is forus a purely theoretical abstraction. The Western mind can do nothingwith it. To the Indian way of thinking such hypostatized abstractions aremuch more concrete and substantial. For example, to the Indian, thebrahman or thepuruüais the one unquestioned reality; to us it is the finalresult of extremely bold speculation.Mrs. Baynes:What does Professor Hauer mean by the metaphysicalaspect?6Dr. Jung:That again is thesÖkümaaspect. We can speak of it only insymbols. Such symbols, for instance, are water and fire, the metabasisinto the unconscious.Mrs. Crowley:Is there a connection between thesaôskvraand the crea-tive principle? And is the puer aeternus related to them?7Dr. Jung:Thesaôskvracan be compared tomÖlvdhvra, for they are theunconscious conditions in which we live. Thesaôskvraare inheritedgerms, we might say—unconscious determinants, preexisting qualitiesof things to be, life in the roots. But the puer aeternus is the sprout thatbuds from the roots, the attempt at synthesis and at a release frommÖlvdhvra. Only by synthesizing the preexisting conditions can we befreed from them.Dr. Reichstein:Are thesaôskvraarchetypes?Dr. Jung:Yes, the first form of our existence is a life in archetypes.Children live in this form before they can say “I.” This world of the col-lective unconscious is so wonderful that children are continually beingdrawn back into it and can separate themselves from it only with diffi-culty. There are children who never lose the memory of this psychicbackground, so extraordinary are the wonders it holds. These memoriescontinue to live in symbols. The Hindus call them the “jewel world” or“manidvipa,” the jewel island in the sea of nectar. With a sudden shockthe child passes from this marvelous world of the collective unconsciousinto thesthÖlaaspect of life or, expressed in another way, a child goesintosvvdhiü°hvnaas soon as it notices its body, feels uncomfortable, and6Hauer defined his concept of the metaphysical as follows: “I make a distinction betweenthe theology of tantric yoga . . . meaning their way of looking at the gods, the way they figurethem, etc., and metaphysics, which is the philosophical aspect of that theology” (HS,25–26). Under this he included the distinctions between thesthÖla,sÖküma,andparvaspects.7On the puer aeternus, see Marie-Louise von Franz,Puer Aeternus(Santa Monica,1981);andPuer Papers, edited by James Hillman (Dallas,1979).69"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"LECTURE 4cries. It becomes conscious of its own life, of its own ego, and has thenleftmÖlvdhvra. Its own life now begins: its consciousness begins to sepa-rate itself from the totality of the psyche, and the world of the primordialimages, the miraculous world of splendor, lies behind it forever.Mrs. Crowley:Is there any connection betweencitta8and Kundalini?Dr. Jung: Cittais the conscious and unconscious psychic field, collec-tive mentality, the sphere in which the phenomenon of Kundalini takesplace.Cittais simply our organ of knowledge, the empirical ego intowhose sphere Kundalini breaks.9Kundalini in essence is quite differentfromcitta. Therefore her sudden appearance is the coming-up of an ele-ment absolutely strange tocitta. If she were not entirely different fromcittashe could not be perceived.But we ought not to speculate too much about these concepts, be-cause they belong to a field of thought which is specifically Eastern.Therefore we have to be very sparing in our use of these concepts. Ingeneral our psychological terms are quite adequate for our use. It is bet-ter for us to make use of the tantric concepts only as technical terms,when our own terminology falls short. Thus, for instance, we are obligedto borrow the conceptsmÖlvdhvra,orsthÖlaandsÖkümaaspects, fromtantric yoga, because our own language has no expressions for the corre-sponding psychic facts. But a concept likecittawe do not need. Also, theconcept of Kundalini has for us only one use, that is, to describe our ownexperiences with the unconscious, the experiences that have to do withthe initiation of the suprapersonal processes. As we know from experi-ence, the serpent symbol then occurs very often.8Woodroffe stated: “Citta in its special sense is that faculty (Vùtti) by which the Mind firstrecalls to memory (Smaraõa) that of which there has been previously Anubhava or pra-tyaüka Jñvna—that is, immediate cognition.” In Arthur Avalon (pseud. Sir John Wood-roffe),The Serpent Power(London,1919),64. For Hauer, “Cittais absolutely everything thatis in our inner world. . . . Everything is under the power ofcittaand thereforecittais ‘soul’is the sense of being the complete inner cosmos. . . . If I understand the psychology ofDr. Jung deeply enough, I feel that his conception of soul has something of this conceptionofcitta”(HS,33). Zimmer definedcittaas “whatever is experienced or enacted through themind.” In Heinrich Zimmer,Philosophies of India, edited by Joseph Campbell (London,Bollingen Series XXVI,1953),321. Surendranath Dasgupta stated, “The states or vùttis ofcitta are described as of five kinds: (1) right cognition, (2) illusory knowledge, (3) imagina-tion, (4) sleep, and (5) memory.” In Dasgupta,Yoga Philosophy in Relation to Other Systems ofIndian Thought(Calcutta,1930),273. Feuerstein stated, “The wordcittais the perfect pas-sive participle of the verbal root=cit, meaning ‘to recognize, observe, perceive’ and also ‘tobe bright, to shine.’ It is applied wherever psychomental phenomena connected with con-scious activity are expressed.”The Philosophy of Classical Yoga(Manchester,1980),58.Foracommentary on the difficulties of translating this term, see Feuerstein,The Philosophy ofClassical Yoga; and Agehananda Bharati,The Tantric Tradition(London,1992),44–47.9In his commentary on Pantajali’sYoga Sutra, Jung translatedcittaas consciousness.Mod-ern Psychology3,122.70"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"APPENDIX1INDIAN PARALLELS111October1930On this last seminar day a concept will be given of what the seen means,of how it is to be understood. This series of pictures has not been shownas a model. We must not bypass the European world and our own pre-conditions in order to create a therapeutic method out of such a process.The revival of inner images must develop organically.Here one could field the objection whether this case would also havedeveloped in this way if Dr. Jung, who himself knew about these things,had not been present. In other words: whether some kind of thoughttransmission or influence of the most subtle kind did not take place. Tothis one may only respond that, as is known, one cannot experiment withfate. It is impossible to determine how an event would have played itselfout had this or that moment been different. In the case of spiritual devel-opment it is possible to exclude the subjective factor only through find-ing out whether things have taken place in the same way at other timesand at different places. Dr. Jung tried to seek out such parallels. Theycan be demonstrated in the literature of all periods. Besides, Dr. Junghas in his possession various series of corresponding imaginal develop-ments that originate from human beings of other parts of the world. Thiswould constitute proof. But there is still another much more strikingproof: a great culture has held these matters and symbols as its religiousand philosophical teachings for more than two thousand years—namelyIndia. Here we find the historical parallels to the series of images which1For the source of this lecture, see the preface, p. xi. Jung’s manuscripts headed “Tan-trism” and “Chakras” closely correspond to the report of this seminar. The first page of thefirst manuscript consists of a list of Woodroffe’s publications, and references and citationsfrom Zimmer’sArtistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India, translated by G. Chappleand J. Lawson (Princeton,1984),26–62. This suggests that these works formed Jung’smain source for his general conception of tantric yoga.2and3closely correspond to theopening sections of this seminar. In a few places the terminology in this seminar has beenmade consistent with that used in the preceding seminars.71"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1arose spontaneously in the circle of Jungian patients. Thereby proof isalso given that these inner processes are not influenced by Dr. Jung’spoint of view but rather correspond to a primordial structure of thepsyche.The parallels are above all found in Indian tantrism (tantra meansbook). Tantrism is a movement which sprang up at a time when medie-val Buddhism was deeply mixed with Hindu elements; that is to say,when Hinayana-Buddhism (the small vehicle) foundered in India anddeveloped into Mahayana-Buddhism (the great vehicle) in Mongolia.That period of Buddhism when the Mahayana branch split off is one ofpeculiar syncretism: Hinduism redressed Buddhism through the prac-tice of meditation in such a way that several intermediary forms werehardly recognizable as Buddhism any longer. The religious form ofShivaism contained mainly tantric ideas. The middle-Buddhist yogapractice divides into two trends:svdhanaandvajrayvna.In the magic rituals ofsvdhanapractice mantras (power words) play arole. By way of the mantra it is possible to call forth the god. The emer-gence of the vision of the god is supported by a yantra2(mandala). Ayantra is a cult image, in the center of which the god is depicted.Through intensive contemplation of the god, it comes alive. The viewerenters into the god, and the god is in the viewer (identification with thegod, deification of the viewer). This method may be used to attain unitywith the All, but also for sheer magic with worldly aims (fakir trickery).Contrary to this is thevajrayvnabranch.Yvnameans vehicle, or way.Vajrais ambivalent and has both a divine and a phallic meaning. It cansignify: lightening, power, libido, divine energy, intelligence, power ofconsciousness. Or else it is the thunderbolt and stands mystically for theli ́ga. Its female counterpart ispadma-lotus, which stands mystically fortheyoni. In worship one frequently finds symbols of the unification ofvajraandlotus.As a consequence of the ambivalent meaning ofvajra,aschool of theright handand aschool of the left handhave developed. The former sees invajrathe divine energy. It represents the philosophical direction andloses its way from time to time in excessive spirituality. The school of theleft hand, which is rather frowned upon, is the advocate of the sexualpoint of view. For it,vajrais the expression of the fulfillment of personalsexuality. (In the battle between these two viewpoints, one easily recog-nizes the parallels with the science of psychology today.)2Concerning the yantra, Zimmer noted: “This word is a very broad designation for aninstrument or tool, a device or a mechanism a person uses for carrying out a specific task.The sacred image is a device of very efficient construction used for both magical and ritual-istic spiritual functions” (Artistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images of India,28).72"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"INDIAN PARALLELSMahayana teaches that all things are embryos of the Buddha; they areembryos of thetathvgata, the complete. All things are formed out of thesame energy;vajrais immanent in everything. Thus also the fourth body(subtle body) of the Buddha is a manifestation of the lightening powerin the form of bliss; it isvajrasattvaorvnanda—bliss. (Nietzsche: “Sinceall pleasure wants eternity, wants deep, deep eternity.”3) In this state ofbliss and in the form ofvajrathetathvgataembraces itsåakti. This is theeternal cohabitation of the god with its female form, its offspring, its em-anation, its matter. This belief occurs above all in Shivaism.4The wor-shiped god isåiva, the many-armed. He is the hunter on the mountains,the lightening, the hidden power of creation. He is purely contempla-tive. His spouse isåakti, the emanation of power, the active creativepower. This idea corresponds to an old Upanishad concept ofpuruüaandprakùiti.(åiva andåakti =puruüa;andprakùiti=li ́gaandyoni.)åivais also conceived and portrayed in images of worship asçiva-bindu(bindu= point), that is, as the latent point-shaped power of creation. Surround-ingçiva-bindu, around the center, rests theåakti in the shape of a wheelor cakra. This is the primal form of the mandala. Such a cakra is alsocalled apadma-lotus. To this relate the mystical syllablesOm mani padmehum, which are best translated as something like: “Oh, by the gem in thelotus.” They mean the highest perfection and the first beginning at thesame time. Contained therein is everything that can be said.

The tabula rasa of childlikeconsciousness is predetermined through the experience of foresight—through the collective unconscious, we would say. But the Indian says:åakti has consciousness in itself. (Herein lies a key to the inconceivable.)The first childhood dreams contain thesaôskvras, the archetypes.

In our middle age we are youngest, precisely at the time whenwe have completely or almost completely lost contact with the collectiveunconscious, thesaôskvras. We grow older again only as with the mount-ing years we remember thesaôskvrasanew.Within thevajrayvnabranch a peculiar form of yoga practice has de-veloped, theåakti or Kundalini yoga.

It is the anima, theDevz-çakti, which has conceived the world.9(This is, of course, a viewwhich corresponds to male psychology. Seen from the woman’s point ofview the animus devises the world.)åiva emanatesåakti.åakti begetsMvyv.Mvyvis desire and therebyerror: she is the fire of error.

TheHangsa Upanishadsteach: in the heart region there is an eight-leafedlotus. The eight leaves correspond to the compass and portray bothmoral and psychic states. At the center lives Vairagya, passionlessness,disinterest, and detachment (cf. Meister Eckhart).According to another teaching brahman can be attained from fourcardinal points: these appear separately in the head, neck, heart, andnavel. In theDhyanabindu Upanishadsit is said, “The great and powerfulwith the four arms, that is, Vishnu, should be worshiped in the navel.” Inthe cakras the elements are cleansed with the help of Kundalini. In Kun-dalini yoga six cakras, or centers, are distinguished. The first cakra liesnear the perineum and is calledmÖlvdhvra. The second is namedsvvdiü°hvnaand is located in the small pelvis.The third has its seat in the naval region: it is calledmaõipÖra.Anvhatais located near the heart diaphragm. In the neck liesviçuddha. The up-permost center,vjñv, lies in the head between the eyebrows. Still higherthan these corporeal cakras lie some metaphysical cakras: hence themanacenter and above that thesomacakra. This teaching of the cakrasshould not be misunderstood as concrete and corporeal like the theoso-phers tend to do today. These centers are not corporeal entities.

The other has its beginning in the righttesticle and ends in the left nasal opening. This pair of paths are callediìvandpiõgalv(iìv=moon, female;piõgalv= sun, masculine). The onelying to the left is the moon or water stream, the one to the right is thesun or fire stream.

If we place it ona foundation which, to begin with, we possess through our own experi-ence, it will become more readily understandable. To be sure, it isdifficult to compare the somber, earthbound figures of our unconsciouswith the Indian representation. To meditate on the cakras we first haveto extricate the original experience; hence we cannot adopt the ready-made figures of yoga, and the question still remains whether our experi-ences fit into the tantric forms altogether. It all thereby depends onwhether we possess this matter which India already has. That is why wehave to come up with our own methods which can familiarize us withcorresponding contents.Ten or fifteen years ago, when patients brought me the first “man-dalas,” I did not yet know anything about tantra yoga. At this time Indol-ogists were not familiar with it either—or, whenever it became known, itwas scorned not only by the Europeans but also by wide sections of theIndian population. Its seeming oddity was only sniffed at. But we have toforget this sniffing at it now.It is a fact that with us these things come individually and immediatelyout of the earth, but as small, ridiculous beginnings which we find hardto take seriously.Example: we are dealing with a (female) patient with whom, after sixyears of sporadic analysis, I had finally, if very hesitatingly, to take the79"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2“yoga path.” She was a practicing Catholic. Catholics have a stillborn un-conscious, because the church has already entirely formed, regulated,and squeezed the nature of the unconscious. There is early evidence forthis. Archbishop Athanasius of Alexandria,1for example, in his biogra-phy of St. Antonius, gives his monks instructions about what from theunconscious is good and bad. He says that the devils can also speak“words of truth” and that they can talk about things that are true. But, hestates,It would be a disgrace for us, if those who revolted against Godshould become our teachers. Let us arm ourselves with the armourof justice and let us put on the helmet of redemption, and at thetime of battle let us shoot mental arrows from a faithful mind. Be-cause the devils are nothing, and even if they were something, theirstrength would comprise nothing which could resist the might ofthe cross.2Also, the religious exercises of Ignatius of Loyola3are Christian coun-terparts to the Indian meditations or to our fantasies from the uncon-scious. The religious exercises are meditations according to church in-struction; their purpose is the rehearsal of the symbols of faith. By it thevanishing of all thoughts and fantasies that are dogmatically unaccept-able is provoked.By means of such an attitude a complete paralysis developed in mypatient—everything was already there on the outside, and hence had be-come invisible inside. I tried for six years to analyze her back into thechurch, so to speak, until she confessed what she would not have con-fessed to a confessor: that she believed neither in God nor in the popebut that nonetheless she would die in the fold of the church. Despite herage (she was fifty-five years old at that time), it made her suffer that every-thing in her was dead and dark, for after all she was still alive, and this lifewas asserting its rights. I was in a fix, because I saw that the living spiritwanted to get its way in spite of everything, and then came the originalexperience.1[Note to the1933edition: See Jung,Psychologische Typen,2d ed.,78ff.] (I.e.,CW, vol.6,§§82ff.)2InCW, vol.6, §82, this passage is cited from “Life of St. Anthony,” inThe Paradise orGarden of the Holy Fathers, compiled by Athanasius, archbishop of Alexandria, et al., trans-lated by E.A.W.

SeeModern Psychology4.80"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"JUNG'S COMMENTS IN HAUER'S GERMAN LECTURESI instructed her thus to observe whether images were appearing be-fore falling asleep, and I asked her about dreams. Until then she hadbeen dreaming, but from the time of my question onward she did notdream any more. Therefore I told her to lie down and close her eyes, andnow she had a vision: she saw a dark wall. She had to hold on to thisimage, concentrate on it (dhvrvõa), contemplate it—“impregnate it,” sothat it could become animated.As she did so, the wall was divided into trees—it became a dark jungle,then figures started to move beneath the trees. It was in New Mexico,and the figures were an entire tribe of [American] Indians. The Indianarchetype of the American had been animated in her.A lake appeared before the forest. (The forest, the original home ofhumanity, represents the unconscious. The lake, with its even surfaceimpenetrable to the eye, is also an image for it.) The Indians loosenedcanoes from the lakeside, loaded women and children into them, andcrossed the lake. On the other side was a desert; the Indians put up theirtents there, made a fire, cooked, ate, and then retired to the tents. Theyevidently went to sleep, even though it was broad daylight and the sunstood motionless in the sky. Only the chief remained outside and turnedhis face to the sand desert.Here you see the world ofcitta—figures which the patient has notmade and that live their own lives “willfully,” according to their own laws.The patient now repeatedly concentrated on the chief, but he did notmove. Nothing at all happened any more. The patient had evidently ar-rived at the dogmatic wall, which puts before the individual experienceof the unconscious all punishments of hell.At least the relief was great enough that she could live for a yearthrough the effect of the image, which she never lost from sight now.At the same time, there also developed attempts to break off—she saw,for example, heavy transport vehicles in a sandstorm, or horsemen ina snowstorm. These images are a side-elucidation of the danger, inwhich she found herself through the contact with the unconscious. Butsuch a break is not permitted, because the story has to be brought to itsend. The patient has to stick with it and try to make progress with theIndian.After a year she came back to analysis; and one day she was particularlyimpressed by the calm, dry, clear desert air in which the Indian wasstanding. Suddenly she felt a bit of humidity in the air which had notbeen there before. Something had finally moved, and it stirred her tothe extent that again she could continue to live for a year.When after this time she came back to me, she told me that the Indian81"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2was not there any more; he had faded. Where had he gone? She had asecond vision, and the first one had been dissolved in the second: a whiteserpent appeared to her in splendor and imperturbable majesty, wear-ing feathers and a diadem.Personally she was in no way aware of what this image signified. It isthe well-known representation of the Mexican air and wind god Quetzal-coatl in his shape as a feathered serpent (the Plumed Serpent). He is theredeemer-god of the Indian, who embodies for the psyche of the Ameri-can person the unconscious spirit.This vision impressed my patient tremendously and gave her the cour-age, after ten years, finally to make her general confession to me—withwhich the therapeutic effect was, of course, achieved.What had actually happened? The humidity had descended as dewand had fertilized and burst the wrapping of the Indian. He now showedher his actual meaning, his undogmatic pagan face. From the point ofview of the church, it was the appearance of a devil, who had merelyassumed the form of the redeemer to mislead the Christian. Thus theSpanish conquerors of Yucatan already interpreted the crosses that theyfound all over the country as a seduction of the devil. The early Chris-tians, as well, who recognized the similarity between the myth of Di-onysus and the life of Christ, thought that the devil had invented thisAnticipatio Christiexpressly to confound them.What the patient actually did during her analysis was reallypÖjv—per-sisting in prayer—which then caused the transformation.Laya, the redis-solution of the figures, would for us correspond to the intellectual pro-cess of comprehension. The patient has to know what has happened toher; she has to understand her own myth. The image would capture anddetain us, if we would not dissolve it through comprehension. Onlywhen we have assimilated it to the height of consciousness can newfigures emerge.6October1932Dr. Jung:What one could still add here, from the psychological side, isthe purely empirical results of the analysis.4In every typical course of ananalysis greater awareness emerges through realizing repressions, pro-jections, and so on. The analytical process thus occasions a broadening4These remarks follow a discussion of the process of the development of consciousnessin yoga.Tantra Yoga,50–51.82"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"JUNG'S COMMENTS IN HAUER'S GERMAN LECTURESof consciousness, but the relation of the ego to its objects still remains.The ego is intertwined in conflict with the objects—one is still a part ofa process. Only in the continuation of the analysis does the analogy withyoga set in, in that consciousness is severed from its objects (Secret of theGolden Flower). This process is linked up with the process of individua-tion, which begins with the self severing itself as unique from the objectsand the ego. It is as if consciousness separated from the objects and fromthe ego and emigrated to the non-ego—to the other center, to the for-eign yet originally own. This detachment of consciousness is the freeingfrom thetamasandrajas, a freeing from the passions and from the en-tanglement with the realm of objects. This is something which I cannotprove philosophically any further. It is a psychical experience, which inpractice is expressed as a feeling of deliverance. What has caused one tobe previously seized with panic is not a panic any more; one is capable ofseeing the tension of opposites of the world without agitation. One doesnot become apathetic but is freed from entanglement. Consciousness isremoved to a sphere of objectlessness. This experience has its effects inpractical life, and indeed in the most palpable way. It is illustrated prob-ably most beautifully in the tale of Buddha being threatened by Mara.Mara and all his demons assail him, but the throne of Buddha is empty—he is simply not sitting there any more. Or asRig VedaI,164, has it: “Twoclosely united friends both embrace one and the same tree. One of themeats the sweet berry, the other looks down only composedly.”5*Dr. Jung:One has to take into account here the differences between thecases in question, because what the symbols mean is entirely dependenton the particular state of consciousness of the individual.6Thetreeisthetree of life. If it is standing up it is an indication of an unfolding andprogressing life. When the “yoga path” is taken, one can find this symbolat the beginning. It also appears when doubts exist about the value of thepath. The “yoga path” is the path of the plant—a plant function as op-posed to an animal one. Ego consciousness is, so to speak, like an animalthat can speak and move freely. The tree, however, signifies the not-being-able-to-make-way and the rootedness of the plant. When someonerealizes this, he suddenly has the feeling: “Now I am imprisoned.” The5Cf.The Rig Veda: An Anthology, translated by Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty (London,1981),78, where a slightly different rendition of the same passage is given.6Hauer and Gustav Heyer had related accounts of dreams that featured trees.Ta nt r aYoga,52.83"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2image of the uprightly growing tree then placates his fear, which seessomething frightening in the unavoidable.When the path has already been taken, however, and the conviction ofgrowth has been consolidated, then the Christian prejudice comes: whatgrowshas togrow upward. Then the image of the tree can appear withthe roots on top, showing that its growth does not go up into the sky butdownward into the depth.There is also the tree with roots on top and at the bottom. Here it isemphasized that one gets to roots wherever one goes. This is what some-one dreams who wishes or hopes for too much. He is being told, “Every-thing around you is earth, and with the earth you are supposed to forma union.”Conversely, the tree can have crowns on top and at the bottom; hereeverything is leaf and blossom and fruit—“heaven above, heaven below.”Also, when the development apparently leads downward, the tree willstill bear blossoms and fruit. I could substantiate this for each of thecases.8October1932Dr. Jung:Professor Zimmer has depicted the material as relatively simpleto us.7I find it highly complicated—an ocean of individual differences,so ill defined that one cannot touch it anywhere! Individual problemscannot be understood in uniqueness; thus one is thankful for all refer-ences, such as Zimmer’s bookArtistic Form and Yoga in the Sacred Images ofIndia, or the translation of the tantric texts by Avalon, which show thatthere have always been people with such problems. The Indian concep-tual world was thus for me a means to clarify personal experiences.In1906I found in a mentally ill patient for the first time the image ofa serpent, creeping up on her back, its head divided into a crotch. In1909I even gave a lecture on this case without being aware of its generalsignification.After the war a twenty-eight-year-old girl came to see me, wanting to becured within ten hours. She said that she had a black serpent in her belly.She came to see me because of this serpent, for she thought that itshould be awakened. Her problem was that she was not on earth. She was7Zimmer had given an account of yoga practice as a process of self-transformation.Ta n -tra Yoga,97–100.84"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"JUNG'S COMMENTS IN HAUER'S GERMAN LECTURESonly intuitive, entirely without a sense of reality. She was living in a secretbrothel without being aware of it; she did not hear her own steps and hadnever seen her body. She dreamed that she was inside or on top of bal-loons, from which I had to shoot her down. One day she came and saidthat the serpent in her belly had moved; it had turned around. Then theserpent moved slowly upward, coming finally out of her mouth, and shesaw that its head was golden. This is the shortest Kundalini path of whichI have heard. To be sure, it was not experienced but only intuited; butalready this had a curing effect for the time being. This case is a simpleexample of the spontaneous appearance of the Kundalini.I got to know about the cakras only later, but even then I did not sayanything about it, so as not to disturb the process in my patients.The cakras are symbols for human levels of consciousness in general.Ethnically and psychologically we can distinguish three different psychi-cal localizations, of which the first corresponds more or less tomÖlv-dhvra-svvdhiü°hana, the second tomaõipÖraandanvhata,andthethirdtoviçuddhaandvjñv. The psychology of the lower centers is analogous tothe one of primitives—unconscious, instinctive, and involved in partici-pation mystique. Life appears here as an occurrence, so to speak, with-out ego. One is not aware that one wants or does things; everything hap-pens as it were in the third person.The next localization is in the region of the diaphragm, thusmaõipÖra-anvhata, with oscillations up and down, above and beneath the dia-phragm. Beneath the diaphragm, all occurrence is self-evident. InmaõipÖrais the emotional human being, who again and again is inun-dated and becomes constantly the victim of his passions.Only above the diaphragm is it: I want. In the heart—anvhata—is thefirst notion of the self, of the absolute center, the substance to which lifeis related. This notion of the self is the flame inanvhata. Here the ra-tional functions start. We have figures of speech that still now expressthis. We say “cross my heart,” or we beat our chest when we refer to our-selves. The Pueblo Indian thinks in his heart, as does the Homeric per-son, whose spirit is located in the diaphragm (Phren—the emotional andthinking soul). Our psychical localization is admittedly in the head, butthe gesture is still archaic, and when emotions become involved, our psy-chology slips down tomaõipÖra.But most of the time we do not notice this. We believe ourselves to livein thevjñvcenter; we are convinced that we are masters in our ownhome. But if we believe that our thoughts are our epiphenomenologyand thatwehave had them, we all too easily forget how often our85"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2thoughts haveus. By thinking that psyche and brain are identical we be-come godlike, but our emotions bring the lower centers in us again intoeffectiveness.In history we can also watch the Kundalini process. First the belly-con-sciousness of the primitive developed, and he only noticed what setheavy on his belly or in his stomach. Paul still said, “The belly is yourGod.” Then the diaphragm-consciousness of the Homeric person devel-oped, and he felt his emotions. This was expressed in states of respiratorytension and in changes in the heartbeat.Only the modern Western person has noticed that the head can alsobe affected. Before that, it had not been much more than a button on afeeling body. How much this was really the case, we can see clearly in therepresentations of humans on the rock paintings of Negroes, which LeoFrobenius, for example, has reproduced in his bookEr ythräa.8You willfind images there of humans with extraordinarily long bodies on which,to some extent very small, or by way of suggestion, human or animalheads are placed.Only the contemporary person can say: “Now I am thinking.” Theviçuddhacenter expresses theword, and what surpasses this would be thecenter of abstraction.I would like to point to one more important analogy. In all cases whichinvolve such symbols, we may not forget the course of the sun as a mainmotive. The analogy to Kundalini is the sun serpent, which later in Chris-tian mythology is identified with Christ. The twelve disciples are thoughtof as stations of the annual cycle supported by the zodiac serpent. Allthese are symbols for the change of the creative power. InmÖlvdhvraisthe night sun, and beneath the diaphragm the sunrise. The upper cen-ters starting fromanvhatasymbolize the change from midday up tosunset. The day of sun is the Kundalini passage—ascent and descent—evolution and involution with spiritual signs. The course of the sun is theanalogy to the human life course.The cakras, moreover, are, like all symbolic step formations, also thesteps of mysteries, where the beginner steps into the dark (katabasis)andcomes up again as deus sol via seven steps, as Apuleius describes it inTheGolden Ass.The greatest difficulties for my comprehension were caused by thegod inbinduandåakti. With us, the anima always first appears so gro-tesque and banal that it is difficult to recognize theåakti in it. But then,what is God? He is the pale reflection of the ever-invisible central god in8Leo Frobenius,Erythräa: Länder und Zeiten des heiligen Königsmordes(Berlin,1931).86"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"JUNG'S COMMENTS IN HAUER'S GERMAN LECTURESbzja, which one cannot grasp, who is like the rabbit which the hunternever hunts down. That is the self—incomprehensible, because it is big-ger than the ego. This self has a faint reminiscence in us—that is the godinbindu. The god inbinduis our relation to the self, the will in the ego,the daimon, which forces us through need to take the path—the smallindividual god—the inneråiva.9TRANSLATED BYKATHERINAROWOLD9Hauer then stated that although he thought Jung’s account of the psychophysical cen-ters was correct, it left out the metaphysical aspect.Tantra Yoga,103.87"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"APPENDIX3HAUER’S ENGLISH LECTURE8October1932Professor Hauer:Would you like to ask any questions about yesterday’sdiscussion?Dr. Shaw:May I say that it seems to me that if we can only awaken theKundalini when we get to the beginning of the sixth stage on the roadthrough the cakras,1where we are not able to see her, that we would beas far out of reality as the East. We should have something simpler, amixture of earth.Professor Hauer:As I told you, my conception rests upon the classicaltext of theûa°-cakra-nirÖpaõaand on a number of theUpanishads,whereit is quite clear to me that the full awakening can take place only afterthe yogin has gotten to the end ofviçuddha—he must be purified,cleansed—and to the beginning ofvjñv, the stage where the great intui-tions appear.I said yesterday that it was a hypothesis. You must work on it not withthe help of Avalon or the modern Indian writers but from the originaltexts which give us the historical development of perhaps a thousandyears. Most of our writings now are of a very late date, and the originalmeaning is concealed. In the course of the historical evolution all sortsof things have accrued and been superimposed on the original. Myintention is to get at the original always because I am sure that is nearerto us than the yoga evolved in India as it fares now, or a hundred yearsago.It is the same with the classical yoga. I have to take it out of the yoga1Hauer had stated: “As to the question when it [Kundalini] is to be awakened, I think thetexts have been misunderstood by the commentators not only in the West but also in theEast. They all speak as if she could be awakened at any time from the beginning onward.But that is not so. Kundalini can be awakened only after the yogin has mastered all thelimbs of yoga up tosamvdhi, the eight limb or step of yoga. Only after he has finished thewhole course, and has achieved all the changes within that are to be worked by yoga, onlythen can he awaken Kundalini” (HS,96).88"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTURESutras,2with the help of Vyasas’s commentary, the Yogabhvsya. What Ihave explained to you is Kundalini at the highest stage. In the evolutionof the yogin there is always the union of both the man and woman pow-ers. This union is symbolized by the triangle and theli ́ga,asyouknowalready. We have the fact that there is always woman power working inthe growth of knowledge through man power, but only at three stagesdoes the aspect of woman power appear under the symbol of the trian-gle. That means there are epochs in our inner development in whichwoman power plays a very important role. And certainly the erotic aspectof woman power has something to do with the awakening of knowledge.I call that the gross Kundalini—instead of the very sublime, subtle, spiri-tual Kundalini. A number of yoga texts, Hatha yoga, and the yoginsthemselves, in speaking about the awakening of Kundalini, really meanthe awakening of that creative element in woman power which accompa-nies man power all through. But in theûa°-cakra-nirÖpaõa, as I haveshown, only the subtle, sublime woman power is symbolized by Kunda-lini. So for the West, and even for India as it is now, we may say that theawakening of Kundalini is just the awakening of the power that is influ-encing man’s development all through; but this is nottheKundalini. Wemust be clear about the fact that there are the two aspects of the womanpower, and that when the Kundalini is crawling up a certain distance, wehave not awakened the real Kundalini.Mrs. Crowley:That explains it! I could not understand why the two pro-cesses were not going on simultaneously—because that is the thing thatawakens her.Professor Hauer:I want to put it very emphatically that the awakening ofKundalini, as we usually talk about it, is only a preliminary to the awaken-ing which is waiting invjñv. We are certainly still very far from it, if wetake the evolution of our psychic state in general, but it lies ahead of us.Now, the return of the Kundalini after she has united withåiva (whichmeans to be united with the inner self, you know) symbolizes the factthat intuition has dawned upon man; when the union of these two pow-ers has taken place invjñv, then all the regions of the psychic life arepermeated by that power. So now she can go down even to the lowest, tothe erotic, region. It is a different thing if a man lives an earthly life afterhe has awakened the Kundalini; it mayseemto be the same, but it isabso-lutely different from his former experience, it is new. We may look at a Japaneseparallel for a moment.

Then a most important feature, which isnot clearly worked out in yoga, is that after he has found the cow he nolonger cares for her; he sleeps and does not look after her,he just knowsshe is there. That is, after he has had the highest intuition, he does notalways go on looking at it: he lets it drop into the subconscious again asif there were nothing in it. So he lies there asleep, the sun shining in hisface; and he gets up and goes to town:Entering the City with Bliss-Bestowing Hands. His humble cottage dooris closed and the wisest know him not. No glimpses of his inner lifeare to be caught; for he goes his own way without following the stepsof the ancient sages. Carrying a gourd he goes out into the market,leaning against a stick he comes home. He is found in company withwine-bibbers and butchers, he and they are all converted intoBuddhas.Bare-chested and barefooted, he comes out into the marketplace;Daubed with mud and ashes, how broadly he smiles!There is no need for the miraculous power of the gods,For he touches, and lo! the dead trees come into full bloom.3Now perhaps Dr. Jung will say something about the psychological side.Dr. Jung:I came here really in order to answer certain questions. Ofcourse, I am not competent to put these things more clearly in the par-ticular realm of which Professor Hauer speaks, but if you have any ques-tions in regard to the psychological point of view, I would be glad toanswer them. I cannot imagine what is clear to you and what is not.There is naturally great difficulty in linking up this peculiar terminologyand ideology with our psychological language and processes.For instance, to take your question “How can Kundalini be aroused?”It seems to you as if one already had to possess the thing one could pos-sess only afterward in order to awaken Kundalini.Dr. Shaw:It is as if it were doing just what Dr. Jung says we should notdo. He always stresses so much the value of the earth, the necessity forboth the spiritual and the earthly.Dr. Jung:Yes, but that is what the yoga says too—it is right in the body,notintheair.3D. T. Suzuki,Essays in Zen Buddhism(first series) (London,1980),376.90"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREProfessor Hauer:Of course, there is a certain reaction against classicalyoga in tantric yoga. Classical yoga wants to stop when the highest intui-tion is reached; it has altogether a tendency toward letting the world go,while tantric yoga is just the reaction against that, in the idea that theKundalini has to return tomÖlvdhvra. You must also think historicallyhere in order to understand the danger and the necessity of that highspiritual life.Mrs. Crowley:I should like to know Dr. Jung’s psychological opinionabout the difference between thepuruüaand thevtmanas you presentedit.4Dr. Jung:From a psychological point of view you hardly can make adifference between them. They may be all the difference in the world,but when it comes to psychology they are the same. Even in philosophythose two concepts have been used in the same way. At least the differ-ence is too subtle for it to play any role in psychology.Mrs. Crowley:Is the ultimate experience of thevtman(the self) intui-tively seen before thepuruüa?Dr. Jung:If you think in those Hindu terms, you lose yourself in tenthousand aspects; it is exceedingly complicated. To look at it from a psy-chological point of view is much simpler. It is even much too simplifiedwhen put into words, for, as a matter of fact, when you go through ityourself, you see how terribly involved and complicated the whole pro-cess is—you begin to understand why the Hindus have invented so manysymbols to explain that apparently simple thing. But you put it a verydifferent way psychologically. What analysis does, then, is first a reduc-tion. It is analyzing your attitude. You must become conscious of manyresistances and personal things which suppress your genuine mental ac-tivity or your psychological processes. All these inhibitions are so manyimpurities, and your mind must be purified before the psychologicalprocess of transformation can begin.Therefore yoga says one’scitta(mind) must be purified before onecan even think of beginning the way of the Kundalini. It is the same inanalysis. You must clarify the mind until you have perfect objectivity,until you can admit that something moves in your mind independentlyof your will—for instance, until you can acknowledge a fantasy objec-4Hauer had stated thatvtmanandpuruüawere both terms that could be translated as theself. The former term was used in theUpanishadsand tantric yoga, and the latter in classicalyoga: “Thepuruüain classical yoga is just an entity by itself; there are innumerable suchpuruüasin the world, and the divine ego is just one of them . . . whereas in tantric yoga theaspect is somewhat different; invtmanthere is a part of the Absolute, it is the appearanceof the absolute on one point of the whole” (HS,43–44).91"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3tively. You must remove a lot of inhibitions before you are capable ofadmitting that, and until then no objective psychological process cantake place. But when you can admit that the psychical contents haveautonomy, that the idea comes not because you invented it but by itsown autonomous action, then you can see how the thing moves. Thenthe objective process can begin. Then later the self, thepuruüa, can beawakened.Mrs. Crowley:Exactly that. There is a great difference between the twoways.Dr. Jung:There is the preparatory way and then the real awakening.You speak of the realization of thevtman, but that is the result. And thedifference betweenpuruüaandvtmanI would advise not to make forpractical purposes.Mrs. Crowley:Except that as you explain it, there seems to be a verydistinct difference.Dr. Jung:I was speaking of thecitta. The first part is an elaboration ofthecitta, and the second part is the awakening of Kundalini, and only inthe awakening does the self appear—namely, in the subsequent stages ofthe psychological process that begin when you are capable of objectifica-tion. There thepuruüaappears, but not in the first part.Professor Hauer:There is no real difference betweenvtmanandpuruüa;they are synonymous terms. The only difference—and there lies the dif-ficulty—is that the self is mirrored in different ways, which is verymuch what Dr. Jung has said. You cannot see the self clearly incittaatfirst. It is as if it were mirrored in moving water. But then it gets moreand more clear, and inanvhatathere is the same self that was seen belowin flashes, but it appears now as the self that cannot be doubted anylonger. Down below, as long as the mirror or the water was moving, itmight be doubted, but now you know it is there; you cannot lose it,though it is still surrounded by that creative activity, the red color, whichyou have still to go through. Up above it is mirrored in tranquility; it isabsolutely clear.Cittais really no more than a mirror of thepuruüa.There are nokleçaat that stage. And when that happens there is an abso-lute presence, the real presence of the self, and then appears the iden-tity of thevtmanwith theparamvtman. It is a question of being mirroredin a different way in acittawhich is developing.Miss Hannah:I am in an awful muddle as to what the difference isbetween the Western approach and the Eastern. The East apparentlygoes through the jaws of the monster, the makara.Dr. Jung:Professor Hauer gives you a very clear picture of how this92"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREproblem is tackled in the East,5and if you study analytical psychologyyou know how it is tackled in the West.Mrs. Sawyer:I think that the confusion comes from people trying tomake the two fit, the East and the West, yoga and analysis.Dr. Jung:My term for the process which tantric yoga calls the awaken-ing of Kundalini is psychic objectivity. For instance, those visions we aredealing with in the English seminar are experiences on a different plane:they are to be considered not from thesthÖlaaspect but from thesÖkümaaspect. These things happen in the nowhere; they are universal and im-personal—and if you do not understand them as impersonal, you simplyget an inflation through your identification with the universal. So thewhole process begins with the fact that certain things in the mind arepurely impersonal. You are not responsible for their existence; they dropdown from heaven or come up from hell, and you cannot account forthem in any way. Certain fantasies, certain dreams, are very clearly out ofan impersonal sphere, and they are not produced by any intentional pur-pose. These are contents which can be experienced only if you assumethat you can dissociate yourself and play a role.Therefore people always have a tendency to perform mystery plays, tostep out of the ordinary frame of their existence and assume a role. Eventhe most primitive aborigines in central Australia have the very elaborateidea that when they perform their totem rites, it is not as themselves butas their ancestors in the alcheringa times. They identify themselves withthe divine heroes. I am no longer Dr. Jung, I am Zarathustra, and thenI can say the most outrageous things because I speak with the voice of thecenturies—I am talking under the cloak of a great ancestor, and after-ward I take off my paint and am an ordinary citizen again. Now, such athing could never live if it did not answer a psychological need; it is sim-ply another reality because it works. Our rationalism simply cannot un-derstand naturally how it is possible but it does work.For instance, there is the idea that everybody must lead a normal lifeand have at least two children. But many people do not have two chil-dren, or they have many more, or they do not dream of having children5Hauer had stated: “In following the course of this life, you come across that sea mon-ster, the makara; somewhere you will come face to face with a tremendous danger, and youcannot go past it. This monster is pictured in the cakra as covering the whole width of thecrescent (the crescent insvvdiü°hanastands foråiva), and the jaws of the monster are open.Now, if you come from the right you may attack the monster from behind. You don’t fallinto its jaws and may be able to grapple with it, whereas if you come from the left, you willfall into its jaws. It is a question of the right way” (HS,84).93"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3at all. So real life is very irregular, and many things live which should notlive—monasteries, nunneries—they all live, and quite productively,though it is against the bourgeois rationalism of the nineteenth century.And so that impersonal kind of experience, where you can experienceas if you were not yourself, as if you were a stage thing, is the intrinsicelement in all mystery plays, and that condition is artificially broughtabout. I have often told you of the Mithraic mysteries, in which, in theinitiations, people were changed intomilites, the soldiers of the god, andlions, and theheliodromoi, the sun runners of the god.6These were simplydifferent stages of impersonal experience. For instance, a Roman inn-keeper who has been made amilxsis afterward not that alone. Of coursenot—he is what he always has been, but he has experienced himself ona higher level that was not identical with the three-dimensional world: animpersonal level where he was allowed to look out the window into an-other dimensional way, onto psychical reality.The proof of that idea is that it works automatically—it drops upon uslike the fires of Sodom and Gomorrah and can destroy our lives, even.You think you are quite all right and that the world is all right, and sud-denly you cannot cross the street any longer because you have agorapho-bia. You cannot have invented it, it simply takes you by the neck. Andwho does it? We say it is merely a disease, but that is only a word. You canjust as well say that it is an evil spirit causing the fear. That is an exampleof the autonomy of the psychic world, and the proof that such things canlive there. Therefore I advise all people who have such a neurosis: gointo it now, live it, and then you have it in your hands and it has not gotyou any longer.Now, the Kundalini yoga is a symbolic formulation of the impersonalexperience in the Eastern way. It would cause us a great deal of troubleto understand in our Western way what the East tries to convey to usthrough its symbolism. Professor Hauer would surely be the last to en-courage us in taking these things literally. It is only living when one un-derstands it in the Western way, where it is less simple and also less in-volved. When you are not clear about things, you always say they are verysimple. The simplest people in the world are really the great world con-fusers. These things are by no means simple, but it is as well if you havesome straight psychological analogy that will help you to see the connec-tion between the Eastern and the Western experience.Miss Hannah:The Eastern way seems a trifle dogmatic.Dr. Jung:Think of the thousands of years, the thousands of individuals,6Cf. Jung,Analytical Psychology,98–99.94"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREand the thousands of very good intellectual heads that have worked at it.Of course it becomes dogmatic.Miss Hannah:Is psychology already dogmatic?Dr. Jung:Yes, when people say there is no such thing as the uncon-scious, and you say, “That is heresy.” Then you are getting dogmaticunder your skin, and you do not notice it—like going black in Africa.7Miss Thiele:Professor Hauer said yesterday that no European had everactually awakened the Kundalini in a higher sense except possibly Suso,8but would it be possible with the help of the analytical process to get tothe stage at which one might?Professor Hauer:In a thousand years perhaps.Dr. Jung:You must never forget that India is a very peculiar country.The primitive man has lived there since time immemorial and has grownup in absolute continuity. We have not grown up in continuity. We werecut off from our roots. Moreover the Hindu is a very different race. Notonly is it Aryan but there is a great deal of the aboriginal influence ofDravidism. Therefore there are very old chthonic things in the tantricyoga. So we must admit that this particular yoga philosophy is strange toour very blood, and whatever we may experience will take an entirelydifferent turn. We can never take those forms over literally. That wouldbe a terrible mistake, for to us they are artificial processes.Remark:I thought some of the process according to our Western con-ception was similar to that of the Indian yoga.Dr. Jung:Yes, analytical psychology is, of course, an attempt of a similarsort. We did not know that there was such a close analogy with tantricyoga when we were elaborating the beginnings of it. The tantric textswere not translated, and even the experts on that sort of thing knew verylittle of the tantric yoga. Only recently has it become known, through SirJohn Woodroffe’s translations. Our attempt is a perfectly genuine naiveattempt in the same field—of course, with different means, according toour different temperaments and attitude.Professor Hauer:You know, you must compare the preparatory workwhich is done now by analytical psychology with the stages of yoga fouror five hundred years before it became a system. It first became a systemat the time of Buddha, or not long before. What is being done by analyt-ical psychology was done by the thinkers and brahmins of about five hun-dred years before Buddha. The names have been lost. We see only little7On Jung’s fears of “going black” during his visit to Africa, seeMDR,302.8In answer to Dr. Shaw’s question “Do you mean that no one has awakened Kundalini?”Hauer replied: “No one in the West, I think, but I do not know. . . . I do think that Suso, theGerman mystic of the Middle Ages, had the same kind of experience” (HS,99).95"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3flashes of insight coming up, so to speak. One little thing after the otherhas been added to their understanding, perhaps, and then there ap-peared one great mind who created the system whose function it was tobring into order the minds or souls of that epoch. But only for a time—say, for a few hundred years. That is the process of psychic adaptation,which is going on through the whole history of mankind. Christianity,for example, is no longer valid for us all, so it does not work. In a fewhundred years there will be another system. This will disappear just astantric yoga has disappeared. All these systems are human attempts tograpple with the great problem of life by symbols and sentences whichare not only for you and me but for the whole community. The leadingcharacter of symbols that are valid for a whole community can bebrought about only through the work of centuries. Then each individualneed not do all the original work; it has been done for him—and we geta common psychic and spiritual culture. But in a few hundred years thatepoch is finished. The symbol changes, or their life changes, and thedanger lies in carrying on with that symbol as valid in the new epoch.As I look at analytical psychology, it is working from the bottom towarda great building, certainly. Then it will become in a few centuries a mostrigid dogma, and the destroyers will come and say it is all wrong. How-ever, we may be sure that every system has gotten at some truths, whichare lasting. We see that there is something true in the Christian; thereare absolute realities which cannot be dispensed with. And yet we mustfind a new system of truths and symbols. It is the same in India. Histori-cally tantric yoga is only an adaptation of the thousand-year-old yoga toa new psychic situation, and that situation has disappeared from India. Ifthey try to work out life there according to tantric yoga they may go per-haps just as far wrong as we. Take Gandhi. New symbols must be for thewhole community, and Gandhi is the man who, with a quite newmethod, has created those symbols out of the new psychic and spiritualstate. As I told you, when he goes to the ocean and shows a lump of saltto his people, it is as good as a cakra. They need no cakra. Take thespinning wheel. Why should they concentrate on a cakra when they seeGandhi with a spinning wheel? They contemplate it and are carried to ahigher plane of thought—the idea of sacrifice, and so on. That is a new“tantric yoga,” if you like. And yet, as in Christianity, there are also intantric yoga elements which cannot be lost, symbolized truths that areeternal and universal. And those we study, those are valuable. That is thepedagogical value of the cakras. And then there are parallel experiencesthat are made everywhere and always. I have intentionally not talked ofthe psychological parallels of tantric yoga to analytical psychology, for I96"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREwould mix things up, I suppose. I just put this yoga before you, and youyourselves can make the comparisons.Mrs. Crowley:The comparison was illustrated last night in the mandalasdone in the Western way that Dr. Jung showed.9To me it was like seeingcakras in the making, the beginning of things in comparison with theHindu ones which were already developed.Professor Hauer:The Indian ones are perfect. Those shown yesterdayare just rough material, out of which perhaps a cakra will grow. Andthese illustrations show how in spite of all the differences, the humansoul has a good deal of uniformity always and everywhere.Dr. Jung:Well, those are cakras.Professor Hauer:I mean a cakra that is valid for a whole community.Dr. Jung:Yes, that all needs cooperation, the elaboration of thousandsof people and untold centuries.Mrs. Crowley:But what was so startling was that the analogy was so com-plete in the cakras as Dr. Jung developed them one after the other.Dr. Jung:Just there, tantric yoga is a really invaluable instrument tohelp us in classification and terminology, and to create concepts of thosethings. That is why the study of tantric yoga is so fascinating.Mr. Baumann:Professor Hauer said that the yogin had to reach thevjñvcakra for the Kundalini to be awakened.Professor Hauer:In that subtle sense, that spiritual sense, let us say.Mr. Baumann:In analysis there is a preparatory stage—one must getrid of personal inhibitions and so on—and then you reach the imper-sonal. I think it is possible—it really happens, that patients make imper-sonal drawings when they are still in the first stage.Dr. Jung:Oh yes, you can make the most marvelous drawings and youare nowhere at all. Particularly artists. Anybody can make drawings, evenlittle children, and it means precious little. You see, the drawing must bean expression of a fact, of a psychological experience, and you mustknow that it is such an expression, you must be conscious of it. Otherwiseyou might just as well be a fish in the water or a tree in the woods. Forevery plant makes marvelous mandalas. A composite flower is a mandala,it is an image of the sun, but the flower does not know it. The human eyeis a mandala, but we are not conscious of it. So it requires long and pains-taking work in analysis to get people to the point where they becomeconscious of the impersonal character of the problem. And that imper-sonal thing is really the Western analogy to the Eastern mind. Kundalini9“Westliche Parallelen zu den Tantrischen Symbolen” (Western parallels to tantric sym-bols), inTantra Yoga.

I was once treating a writer, a very cleverfellow. He was intelligent and very rational and explained everything tothe rule: everything had its natural cause, and everything was reasonable.He had had a great deal of analysis with people of all the differentschools, and he used to explain his dreams according to the principles ofcausal reduction. Of course, you can say of practically every figure or factor emotion that it comes from some definite experience, and hardly everdo you come across something which has not been in your experiencebefore. Naturally one goes on as long as one can with this kind of think-ing. I thought that finally the dreams would bring up something thatcould not be reduced, and after a long time of working together, he didhave dreams in which figures appeared that he could not trace. For in-stance, he dreamed a great deal of women, as they played an importantrole in his life. Formerly he was able to trace them in reminiscences, tosay, “She looks something like Mrs. So-and-So,” so we were able to stitchthe whole thing together. But then a woman appeared whom we couldnot stitch together. He took the utmost pains to find the memory im-ages, and finally he had to give up; he found absolutely no association,and he had to admit that he was unable to show a reasonable origin forthat figure. So I said, “Here we are at the end of your principle of causalreduction. Now I propose something entirely different—that this thinghas not had its origin in your personal experience but is coming in all byitself, just as if somebody were walking into this room whom we had notinvited, or as if she were stepping out of the wall—she walks, she talks—she must be a ghost.” Naturally he had resistance against that proposi-tion. He said things could not come into his mind which had not beenthere. He had that depreciation of the psychic world which is part of ourWestern attitude. But he had to admit that something very definite hadcome up in his mind which he had not invented and which caused himgreat emotion in his dreams. That was the beginning of the recognitionof the objective autonomous factor and the beginning of the psycholog-ical process. It was as if a real woman had come into his life—he did notknow why she existed, but he had to deal with her existence. I inventedthe termanimain order to designate such figures, which, according toour Western prejudice, should not be.Now, this is the moment where the analogy with the Kundalini processbegins, when something stirs up and develops all by itself. If that processis followed up on, one arrives at results which can be expressed in terms98"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREof tantric yoga. We are grateful to tantric yoga because it gives us themost differentiated forms and concepts by which we are able to expressthe chaotic experiences that we are actually undergoing. As ProfessorHauer rightly puts it, we are at the beginning of something, and in thebeginning things are exceedingly individual and chaotic. Only after cen-turies do they begin to settle down and crystallize into certain aspects;and then, of course, dogma inevitably follows.Mr. Baumann:Dr. Jung mentioned yesterday receiving a mandala in aletter from a patient in which there were fish around the center. It madea great impression on me when she said: “I hope I may find a state whereI am like a center, with the fishes whirling around me.”10Dr. Jung:No, it was to find a way a center around which she could movelike those fish in harmonious order; she would not be the center. Thatis our Western idea. It is a mistake to think that we are the center. Wethink we are gods of our world, and therefore the tantric yoga idea thatone becomes a god is dangerous for us. We start with that prejudice. Butwe are really devilish, awful things; we simply do not see ourselves fromthe outside. We think we are very wonderful people, highly respectableand moral, and so on, but in reality we are bloody pirates. What the Euro-pean thinks of himself is a lie. I learned my lesson from the Red Indianand from the Negro. Look at our world, and you see what we are. But ourprejudice being that we are gods, when anybody dreams of a center hequietly and instinctively puts himself in it. You remember, possibly, thepicture that I showed you last evening—the central stone and the littlejewels round it. It is perhaps interesting if I tell you about the dream inconnection with it. I was the perpetrator of that mandala at a time whenI had not the slightest idea what a mandala was, and in my extreme mod-esty I thought,Iam the jewel in the center, and those little lights aresurely very nice people who believe that they are also jewels, but smallerones. That is what we do—we are always following the example givenby Anatole France inL’Isle des Pingouins(The island of penguins).11St. Malo had baptized the penguins in the heavenly concilium, and whenthey asked St. Catharine what they should do about the penguins’ souls,she said to God: “Donnez-leur une âme mais une petite” [Give them asoul, but a small one]. That is our principle. I gave them a little soul; I10It is likely that Jung showed the mandala by a woman, with fish radiating out from acentral circle, reproduced in “Commentary on ‘The Secret of the Golden Flower,’ ” inCW,vol.13, figure A2.

I thought very well of myself that I was able toexpress myself like that: my marvelous center here, and I am right in myheart.Then I had a dream.12I was in Liverpool, where I have never been,actually. It was very dark and dirty; it rained dirt; and I was walking up astreet with certain other Swiss fellows in raincoats. We were talking to-gether, but it was very disagreeable, and I was thinking of a place whereI could get shelter from the rain and the cold.13We came to a sort ofplateau, a level part of town, where there was a huge and beautiful park.I did not recognize it at first, but it was the mandala which I demon-strated yesterday. There were intersecting paths, and in the center was alittle lake, in the center of that was an island, and upon the island was amagnolia tree of that rosy hue, a beautiful tree. And the tree was stand-ing in full sunshine—it was a most glorious picture on a dark rainy night,that marvelous tree in full bloom; I was fascinated by it. Then suddenlyI discovered that my companions did not notice it; they just walked onand began to talk about another Swiss who was living at the corner of astreet in Liverpool on the left side of the park. I pictured the place: therewas one single street lamp at that corner, and he was living there in anapartment house. They said: “He must be a damned fool to live in Liver-pool in such a dirty place.” But I thought he must be a tremendouslyintelligent fellow, and I knew why he was living there—he knew the se-cret of that island; he had found the right place.14Now, Liverpool is thecenter of life—liver is the center of life—and I am not the center, I amthe fool who lives in a dark place somewhere, I am one of those little sidelights. In that way my Western prejudice that I was the center of the man-dala was corrected—that I am everything, the whole show, the king, thegod. We have come down from that notion. The Hindu, being a primi-tive man, has no such idea. He never imagines he is not a man to beginwith; therefore in the end he can never become a god. But we have antic-ipated the divinity, so we have to come down.12An account of this dream is found inMDR,223–24. There it is dated1927. Addi-tional details from this account are in the notes that follow.13“I had the feeling that we were coming from the harbour, and that the real city wasactually up above, on the cliffs. We climbed up there. It reminded me of Basel, where themarket is down below and then you go up through the Totengässchen (“Alley of theDead”), which leads to a plateau above and so to the Petersplatz and the Peterskirche”(MDR,223).14“On one detail of the dream I must add a supplementary comment: the individualquarters of the city were themselves arranged radially around a central point. This pointformed a small open square illuminated by a larger street lamp, and constituted a smallreplica of the island. I knew that the ‘other Swiss’ lived in the vicinity of one of these sec-ondary centres” (MDR,223–24).100"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREProfessor Hauer:I will say just a few words more about the form andsymbolism of the cakras, repeating certain points we have already dis-cussed. All those mathematical figures in the cakras, in my opinion, indi-cate the life of the cosmos and the psychic life as ordered by laws. Thenthe idea of the lotus is that the whole psychic life is embodied in an or-ganic center. You remember that on each petal is a letter. The letters arehummed in meditation, and while humming one should realize themeaning of each, which is told to you only by a guru. The letters symbol-ize the growing organic aspect hidden in that particular region. This isnot conscious. Hidden away in each petal is a force which must be real-ized and brought into connection with the center. The metaphysical andthe metapsychical15idea is that in the very center of the psychic organ-ism, which is in the very center of the cosmic organism, there is a subcon-scious sound force that regulates life unconsciously, and one should real-ize the meaning of that sound power by meditation. It must come upinto the conscious, and if one can let it work in consciousness it becomesstronger.Thebzja16also should be realized in meditation. The inner workingforce in thisbzjais not a clearly developed personality; it is never named.Thebzjasimply symbolizes a subconscious power in that element ofwhich it is the symbol—this is working in one’s psychic foundation—butit can work with real force only when it is realized by meditation. As youknow, I call that power thebzja-deva.17Out of this is projected or growsthebindu-deva, which is the same force but projected out of the uncon-scious into clear consciousness. But it does not come as clearly into con-sciousness as theåakti, the woman power. I think there is no questionabout it—it has become evident to me—that this is the anima. That hid-den man force is combined with the woman force and should workwithin us, according to the tantric yoga, and that is realized consciouslyin different periods of our lives. This symbolism figuring a great truth Icall aleadingsymbol, a symbol that has a leading character, such as canonly be found in the course of many centuries.There is also a color symbolism, of course. You know that red means15“Metapsychique” was the term proposed by Charles Richet for the branch of studiesnow known in the English-speaking world as parapsychology. See hisTraité de Metapsychique(Paris,1922).16Hauer defined thebzjaas follows: “Thebzjais the germ of a cakra; the wordbzjameansgerm” (HS,80).17Hauer had stated: “I distinguish thebzja-devafrom thebindu-deva.

Thus the golden colorinmÖlvdhvra, which is also in the letters on the petals; there is somehowa subconscious working force of insight in this region. Within the eroticlife a power of insight is working. The erotic seems a way to insight intothe nature of things, and that grows into the spiritual aspect above. ThenthestrangethingisthatinmaõipÖrayou have blue letters on blue-graypetals, and inanvhatathe red color of the pericarp is repeated in theletters on the leaves. Red represents the musical tone there.Anvhata,inmy opinion, symbolizes the creative life—the petals of the lotus are red,and the power of insight is in the center in that golden triangle. Themusical undertone of that region is alive somehow—life has a differentreality; a blood reality comes from the outside and tries to work its way inand harmonize the two.I give you this explanation as a suggestion of how to work on thesethings. I may cite here a word of Lao-tzu: “The meaning that you canthink out is not the meaning.”18Take all I say in this light. Forget every-thing I tell you, and begin asyoumust begin. There are different ap-proaches to these things. Of course, I have certain grounds for my expla-nation, but you must work it out as a riddle that you try and solve. Theremay be more than one meaning, just as there might be two correctmeanings of a dream, through what we may call the coincidence ofthings in our psychic and our outer life. The outer event and the psychicevent may be quite different, yet they have a similar character and maybe symbolized by the same dream. Perhaps one finds the outer and hasnot yet found the inner. It may be the same with cakras: the meaning ofone symbolism runs into another and is discovered only by deep insight.As I told you, that energetic life is all moving, and only by dipping intothat movement can you get at it. Here we reach things which are ratherdifficult to talk about, and the color symbolism is a great help. You sinkinto the color, so to speak, and then you find its meaning.Take theanvhatacakra again. In the center is the triangle, and aroundthat is thebzjaofyam. Then there is the hexagram, consisting of twointerlocked triangles, in dark smoke color, and that is surrounded by thecoloring of the rising sun, and outside that are the twelve red petals of a18A rendition of the commencement of theTao Tê Ching.

You remember that the number of the petals increases ineach cakra after themÖlvdhvra—life unfolds more and more. So it is aliving music of colors. Now try andfeelthe meaning; or you may use theintellect as well. All sorts of associations may come up. Thisbzja yamis theair or stormbzja, and all around it is the tremendous dark smoke-coloredhexagram, and this beautiful red issues from that. My explanation is thatno real creative power would be there unless there were storm andchaos. Therefore this is the storm mandala, all dark, and expressing thepsychic state. It may also be a cosmic state; most probably it is. Then itbreaks through the creative power in the middle, and the glowing redcolor appears.Question:May I ask the significance of the absence of the symbol forman power in some cakras?Professor Hauer:Man and woman power are clearly defined symbols inmÖlvdhvra,inanvhata,andinvjñv. The same symbols do not appear inmaõipÖra,svvdhiü°hvna,andviçudhha, though we know the power is al-ways there. The three stages when man and woman power work togetherin full strength are the three stages of the erotic life, the creative life, andthe intuitive life, so here we have theyoniandli ́ga. But there are inter-mediate stages. I takesvvdhiü°hvnaas the region or the psychic statewhere we lose ourselves in life—we have no goal, we just want to live.Then there are the different aspects; every cakra has three aspects. Wehave thesthÖlaaspect of the flow of water in all that circling round ofwater in our bodies, and thissthÖlaaspect is expressed in nature by thesea. Our bodies are only a small counterpart to the whole, the micro-cosm in the macrocosm. ThesthÖlaof the psychic state would be theexperience of just losing ourselves in life, and here the woman powerplays a part, for in a hidden way, it is not a regulating force.MaõipÖraItake as the life on which rests the working of our whole bodily structure.Here is the fire of digestion. This cakra looks like a tremendous engine.It would express the economics of our body and of our whole being. Andhere also woman does not play a visible role; she remains hidden. Thenabove, inviçudhha, you reach the stage of the wise man who has gottenbeyond creative work, one who lives in the pure light of knowledge. (Youremember that beautiful blue circle outside the whitebzja ham, sur-rounded by the dark lotus petals.) But in order to get to the last stage ofintuition, she again comes in, as I have told you in describing Kundalini.Now the different animals. The elephant always means the carryingpower in India. It comes again in theviçudhhafor the same reason. Thenthere is the sea monster insvvdhiü°hvna, of which I have tried to explainthe symbolism. And you have the gazelle in the heart lotus. We know103"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3from a text in theHathayogapradipikathat the meaning of it is the versa-tile and fugitive mind. There always is, in that creative region, a tendencyin the intellect to run away; you have to fetter the gazelle of the heartlotus, and there is the danger of just making jumps in any direction.These are suggestions toward a method of getting at the symbolismboth through intellectual processes and through feeling. But I thinkDr. Jung will have something to say about its meaning.Dr. Jung:I can only express my extreme gratitude to you for giving usthe symbolism so beautifully and so clearly. If these things mean some-thing rather different to me, it is of course because my approach to thequestion of the cakras was a different one. You know that my first experi-ences in the field were made at a time when there was no chance ofgetting at the teaching of the cakras. When I first touched on the subject,it seemed to me utterly hopeless; I had the feeling that it was the specificsymbolism of an entirely exotic people, which conveyed nothing to us.But then I had an extraordinarily difficult case which caused me greattrouble.19The patient was a girl born in India of European parents.There was no mixture of blood, she was as European as you are. But thefirst six years of her life had been spent in India, where she had had aMalay nurse who was quite uneducated. There was no teaching of thissort, these things were completely unknown to her, but somehow theseEastern ideas got into her unconscious. She could not adapt to Euro-pean conditions because her instincts refused all along the line; shewould not marry, she would not be interested in ordinary things, shewould not adapt to our conventions. She was against everything, and sonaturally she became very neurotic.20First she exploded two analysts,19Jung provided an extended commentary on this case in his “The Realities of ModernPsychotherapy” (1937), inCW, vol.16(this was added to the second edition ofCW, vol.16,as an appendix), and reproduced and commented on several of her paintings in “Concern-ing Mandala Symbolism” (1950), inCW, vol.9, part1, figures7–9, §§656–59. Some sig-nificant comments have been appended in the notes that follow.20In “The Realities of Modern Psychotherapy” Jung stated: “The patient had been bornin Java. . . . In her dreams there were frequent allusions to Indonesian motifs” (§557). In“Concerning Mandala Symbolism” he stated: “The patient was born in Dutch India, whereshe sucked up the peculiar local demonologywith the mother’s milk of her nativeayah....Brought up in India until her sixth year, she came later into a conventional Europeanmilieu, and this had a devastating effect on the flowerlike quality of her Eastern spirit, anda prolonged subsequent psychic trauma was set up” (§657; translation modified—Hull sub-stituted “Dutch East Indies” for “India”). In “The Realities of Modern Psychotherapy” Jungnoted that she was twenty-five when she came to see him, and listed the following addi-tional symptoms: “[She] suffered from a high degree of emotivity, exaggerated sensitivity,and hysterical fever. She was very musical; whenever she played the piano she got so emo-tional that her temperature rose and after ten minutes registered one hundred degrees104"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREthen she came to me and almost succeeded in blasting me, because I hadto explain to her that I could not understand her dreams at all, twothirds of them were absolutely dark to me on account of the peculiarEastern psychology. She kept on working bravely, and I did the same,despite the fact that I could not understand—and here and there we gota little flash of something. She developed an entirely new set of symp-toms,21beginning with a dream which made a tremendous impressionon her: that out from her genital organs came a white elephant. I wascompletely baffled, I had never heard of such nonsense—and yet she wasso impressed that she began to carve the elephant in ivory. Then organicsymptoms appeared: she had ulcers in the womb, and I had to send herto a gynecologist. For months the thing would not heal; they tried every-thing under the sun, and whenever she had a somewhat obstinate dreamthings became worse. For at least five months her condition remainedlike that, and then another set of symptoms began. She developed poly-uria, an impossible amount of fluid; she could hardly hold the urine.22Then the same amount of fluid also developed in the colon and intes-tines, and caused such a rumbling that when I was outside the room andleft the door open I could hear it. It sounded like a little river pouringdown a staircase, and it lasted about ten minutes. With that there wereacute attacks of diarrhea—again floods of water with apparently no prov-ocation; it just happened. At the same time she really loved a man butcould not think of marrying him. And then the thought entered herhead that I, or circumstances, might persuade her to marry and have ababy, but that was impossible. For a whole year she fought against thisidea, until she developed an entirely new symptom. She felt as if the skullhad become soft on top, as if the fontanelle was opening up—like a childwith an open skull—and that something like a bird was descending fromabove with a long beak and going into her through the skull, meetingsomething that was coming up from below. When that happened, thewhole thing cleared up, and she married and had babies. That was theFahrenheit or more. She also suffered from a compulsive argumentiveness and a fondnessfor philosophical hairsplitting that was quite intolerable despite her high intelligence”(§546).21In “The Realities of Modern Psychotherapy” Jung stated: “The first took the form of anindefinable excitation in the perineal region” (§551).22In “The Realities of Modern Psychotherapy” Jung stated: “Psychologically, the symp-tom meant that something had to be ‘ex-pressed.’ So I gave her the task of expressing bydrawings whatever her hand suggested to her. She had never drawn before, and set aboutit with much doubt and hesitation. But now symmetrical flowers took shape under herhand, vividly coloured and arranged in symbolic patterns. She made these pictures withgreat care and with a concentration I can only call devout” (§553).105"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3symptomatology of the case, and it was that which forced me to look intothings; I had the idea that something of the sort existed in the East. It wassoon after Avalon’s bookThe Serpent Powerwas published,23and there Ifound the parallel. You see, first was the elephant inmÖlvdhvra, secondwassvvdhiü°hvna, the water region, and after that the emotional center,maõipÖra; and then it did not go on continuously—something camefrom above, and this brought about the dissolution. At first it was abso-lutely dark to me; I could not understand what had happened. But subse-quently I understood that this was the awakening from above, and shecould then disentangle herself from the maze of the exotic jungle. Shecould objectify the Indian psychology that had been grafted upon herwith the milk she drank from thatayahand through the suggestion ofher surroundings. She became liberated by the objectivity and could ac-cept European life. And, quite naturally, she objectified her whole devel-opment in the most beautiful mandalas. Now, mandalas are reallycakras, though in our experience there are not just six but innumerablemandalas. But they really should be arranged like the cakras, one abovethe other. The first ones are usually connected withmÖlvdhvra,andthenthey gradually come up, and wind up with analogies to thevjñvcenter,or even thesahasrvra, the highest, the seventh center—they are really anequivalent in a way.Since then I have had a number of experiences, and found a certainregularity in them: it was quite clear that a certain set of mandalas, orpsychological conditions, belonged to the psychology of themÖlvdhvraregion, namely, a sort of complete unconsciousness in which one livesmerely instinctively. Then the next is the region of the diaphragm, andthe third is the heart. Now, among the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico Imade friends with an interesting fellow who was the chief of religiousceremonies. He confessed to me that they believed all Americans werecrazy because they said they thought in the head, whereas the Indiansknew that the normal thing was to think in the heart. I stared at him and23The Serpent Powerwas published in1919. The copy in Jung’s library is the first edition.In “The Realities of Modern Psychotherapy” Jung stated: “It is, as you see, quite impossiblethat the patient knew the book beforehand. But could she have picked up a thing or twofrom theayah? I regard this as unlikely, because Tantrism, and in particular KundaliniYoga, is a cult restricted to southern India and has relatively few adherents. It is, moreover,an exceedingly complicated symbolic system which no one can understand unless he hasbeen initiated into it or has at least made special studies in this field” (§559). Jung overesti-mated the obscurity of Kundalini yoga—for instance, Swami Vivekânanda had included anaccount of the cakras and the means of awakening the Kundalini in hisYoga Philosophy:Lectures Delivered in New York, Winter of1895–1896,5th ed. (New York,1899), without, how-ever going into detail concerning their iconography.106"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREthen remembered, of course, that it was only in relatively late periods ofcivilization that the head was discovered to be the seat of the mind. Andthe Pueblo Indians are already civilized—they are really descendants ofour fathers of the Aztec; they have a certain culture. The Greek in Ho-meric times located his thinking a bit below the heart, in the diaphragm.Another word for diaphragm isphren, the Greek word for mind; and thesame root is in the name of the mental disease schizophrenia, whichmeans a splitting of the mind. So in the Homeric days, the physical local-ization of the mind was in the region of the diaphragm. They were con-scious to the extent that they could notice psychological contents inas-much as those influenced the breathing. And certain Negroes put theseat of their emotions and thoughts in the belly. They are conscious inso-far as they notice contents which affect the functions of the abdominalintestines. When we have disagreeable thoughts or feelings, our stom-achs get upset. We still get jaundice when we repress a violent anger, andevery case of hysteria has trouble in the digestive organs, because origi-nally the most profound and important thoughts were down there. Sothose are three localizations of consciousness that are still to be tracedhistorically, as it were.The intervening cakras that are characterized by the absence of theunion of theli ́gaand theyonican be traced, too. I have made someobservations lately concerningviçudhha, for instance. Theanvhatacakra,of course, is the air center, which obviously coincides with the fact thatthe lungs are situated there; and as it is situated above the diaphragm, itmeans that a higher state of consciousness is reached. The heart is alwaysassociated with feelings or with mind; therefore, as I also have seen bypractical experience,anvhatawould be a center of consciousness, of feel-ing and thoughts, which can be blown out in the breath. For feelings alsocome out in the breath; you can express them—you press, and outcomes the feeling in the form of sound. That was the original method ofcalling to the gods. We have a description of it in the Mithraic liturgy,where it says: “Hold both your sides and press them with all your mightand shout like a steer,” so that the gods may hear you.24You see, that isa kind of conscious feeling and thought expression. Now, this is veryprimitive, but most of us are really still about there. We express feelingsand thoughts as if we were just spitting them out, without realizing in theleast what we are doing. You know, many people have not the faintestidea what they are saying, or what they are doing to other people by thusexhaling their thoughts and feelings. I see that all the time. So the think-24Cf. Albrecht Dietrich,Eine Mithrasliturgie(A Mithras liturgy) (Leipzig,1903).107"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3ing and feeling life at this stage is not yet so conscious that it deserves tobe called consciousness, which probably accounts for the fact that theself is only beginning to be visible from theanvhata.The next stage is the purified condition. You see, the air belongs tothe earth. We are walking about here in the air, but above is the etherregion, which we do not reach, and that is abstract thought expressed inhuman language. The ethereal region is the human larynx: speechcomes apparently from the throat, and speech is the life of the word. Theword that leaves one carries the meaning; it is doing things. We are oftentremendously astonished when people flare up and misunderstand whatone says—“and then I said, and she said”—one feels oneself to be en-tirely innocent; one simply had a thought and cannot understand whathappened afterward. So man has slowly learned that the word has exis-tence; it is like a winged being that takes to the air and has magic effects,an abstract being, absolutely purified from the admixture of the lowerregions.Then the strange thing is, I have seen representations of thevjñv,thehighest thing you can imagine, something which is even beyond thewinged word. One can imagine that one could put oneself into a wordandbecomea word, like Jesus, who became the Logos. He detached him-self from God the Creator and took a flight into the world, shining likea light. One could become such an impossible detached thing that oneno longer touches the earth. One would be as creative as a being withgolden wings in a globe or an egg—completely detached. I have reallyseen such a representation. You remember, thevjñvcakra is the man-dala with the two petals, which looks like the winged seed of certaintrees. It is quite purified from any earthly admixture; it has almost nosubstance and is quite purely white light. So one gets the impression ofsomething that really has taken to wings. And I think that the idea of thewinged egg, or the homunculus in the second part ofFaust, the artificiallittle man that flies about in his retort, is really the anticipation of sucha possibility—a man who has created himself again in a new form, as theold alchemist produced a little man in his retort. That, again, I take as asymbol for thevjñvcenter.Now this is, of course, an entirely empirical approach. In our Westernsymbolism it sounds banal or grotesque, far from the absolute perfectionof the East, with its specific style, its specific beauty. We are at this stage inthe rough experience and the raw ordinary material; we are far from anydifferentiation—we are only just beginning to see that we also have cer-tain experiences that approach that kind of symbolism. We also knowsomething about color symbolism—for instance, that the different stagesare always symbolized by different colors. We know all those red things108"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"HAUER'S ENGLISH LECTUREbelong to a region below the diaphragm where there is no air, and whenthe red gets lighter it is a bit above the diaphragm, and when it disappearsand blue prevails, we are approaching the icy regions of detached con-sciousness. And we know that dark colors mean obscurity, or evil, or fear,or heavy matter. And light colors always give the idea of differentiatedthings, of things that are easy, sometimes even cheap, and detached. Sowe have quite a series of colors with almost typical meanings.All those other peculiarities of the Eastern cakras—the letters, thesounds, the mantras, the differentiated gods—all that is, of course, lack-ing in our experience completely. But it is absolutely regular that everymandala has a center, where there is something that one cannot grasp;one tries, but it is most evasive. You see, man has forever felt somethingwhich evades his grasp and is aloof; and which is not an ordinary thing,it is always demoniacal. For instance, when a certain animal always eludeshim, when he never succeeds in catching it, the Red Indian says, “Thatis no good animal; it is a doctor animal and ought never to be caught atall.” A doctor animal is like a werewolf; it is divine or demoniacal. So inour psychology the things we cannot grasp are usually the things towhich we give a sort of divine attribute. Therefore the center of a man-dala, which is the object of drawing the whole mandala, is the very thingthat escapes, that cannot be tied down; one is forever deceived about it.In the center is the invisible god.Moreover, in each mandala one inevitably finds the male and the fe-male elements clearly indicated, as here in thedevzoråakti. And youremember that Kundry, for instance, in the Parsifal legend is also repre-sented with fangs, likeåakti;25in the lower localizations of our psychol-ogy there is a most terrible and bloodthirsty thing. Emotions on thatlevel are not mitigated by any kind of reason; there people have emo-tions and tear everything to bits because they themselves are torn intoshreds, the woman by theanimusand the man by theanima. We mustallow for a new kind of cakra. In the case of a woman we should put intheanimus.Theanimusis also a thing with fangs. Here, too, we haveparallels, in that these figures are never in the center and will not be,because they are things that are already known—they are the illusions,orMvyv, of gods. In the psychology of a Western mandala, the god is themost excentric ego power, “my” power, just as thebindu-devaand theåakti are usually on one side, away from the center. It is “my” power, butit is moved by the invisible divine power in the center; in the center is thegreat one, and the other is the smaller one. As Faust says, man is the25On the significance of the Parsifal legend for Jung, see John Haule, “Jung’s AmfortasWound,”Spring: A Journal of Archetype and Culture53(1992):95–112.109"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"APPENDIX 3small god of the world. I am only thebindu, but thebzjaletter, the realthing, is the self, and whatever I do is moved or caused by thebzja-deva.So one understands right away that part of the Eastern symbolism, de-spite the fact that in our mandalas it is never in such a form because wedon’t know what the gods are. We have not the faintest idea of God, wehave only a philosophical conception of thesummum bonumas the Chris-tian God in heaven, which we cannot imagine properly, and thereforewe cannot put it into our mandalas. Well, that is the main thing I wantedto say. One could talk, of course, for a couple of centuries, but otherpeople must do that—I won’t live so long.Professor Hauer:I have been most interested, it has been most enlight-ening—and I think that if we take just the psychic elements, these expe-riences may help us a long way toward the creating of new mandalas. Iwould not agree, perhaps, with every explanation, but to a great extentwith the fact that there are first physiological centers, then psychic cen-ters, and so on. I suppose it would be a great thing for the Indian yoginsto listen to Dr. Jung; it would help them to get those cakras into motionagain, they have made them into a metaphysical condensation and donot see and feel so much, just the psychic aspect, and it is very importantto have that side. But then, of course, the development in India wasthe other way, toward metaphysics. There were two causes, I think, forthe creation of the heart mandala. First, through certain experiences inthe heart; the great intuitions did not come through thinking, it is saidthousands of times in theUpanishads. They felt that the deepest intui-tion—which stands always for the creative power in India—was from theheart. Then I am sure that physiologically the breathing had someinfluence on the composition; and last, of course, they went on to themetapsychical and metaphysical. And I think the study of the symbolismof tantric yoga may help us to push forward in the direction of the meta-psychical and metaphysical. For as I look at it, every center has a psychicand a physical aspect, as well as the metaphysical and metapsychic as-pects. That is indicated in the letters and so on, and also in thebzjas.Further, the gods are psychic as well as metapsychic and metaphysical.So I would say that if we work together from different sides, the yogincoming from above, let us say—Dr. Jung:And I from below!Professor Hauer:Then the great event may happen, as with that girl,your patient. When the two things come together, the child will be born.So I hope something will come out of the work we have done here.110"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"APPENDIX4ûA†-CAKRA-NIRÑPAöAPreliminar y verseNow I speak of the first sprouting shoot (of the Yoga plant) of completerealization of the Brahman, which is to be achieved, according to the Tan-tras, by means of the six Cakras and so forth in their proper order.Verse1In the space outside the Meru, placed on the left and the right, are thetwo Sirvs,åaçi and Mihira.
