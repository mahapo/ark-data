Not the least of these is Jung's claim that his theory falls withinthe domain of the scientific method. 1 However, on account of the many obviouslyextrascientific aspects of Jung's work, we are led to wonder how the scientific elementsof his writings can be reconciled with the extrascientific aspects. Is there in fact a viablescientific theory reconstructable out of Jung's views? What would be the significance ofsuch a scientifically defensible theory of the collective unconscious? Would it beintelligible? Would it really be compatible with present scientific knowledge? And isthere any compelling evidence to suggest that such a theory is in fact true?The present work offers itself as an attempt to answer the questions above. in order tohave any success, it is clear that such a task must begin with a rational reconstruction ofJung's views of the collective unconscious. A rational reconstruction would attempt toclarify the meaning and interrelationships of the basic concepts of Jung's theory so thatit could be shown to be coherent and consistent. in Jung's style of theorizing, clarity andprecision of basic concepts are much less important than fullness of meaning andphenomenologically accurate characterization of phenomena. As a consequence manyof Jung's ideas are as vague and ambiguous as they are fascinating and insightful.However, the purpose of a rational reconstruction, as it is understood here, is not tooppose the spontaneity and richness of creativity with a narrow desire for order andclarity. Rather the aim of such a task is the transformation of the untidy richness ofcreativity into a more directly useable form. In Jung's case this transformation amountsin large measure to a sort of translation from a symbolic and metaphorical mode ofexpression into a simpler and more linear mode. In this regard we have endeavored tomake sense of what Jung is saying without losing sight of what he actually does say.Jung was himself the first to acknowledge the value and necessity of suchreconstruction of his views.2"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Page 2In order to demonstrate the possibility of a scientifically accountable theory of thecollective unconscious, we will need to approach the reconstruction from a naturalisticpoint of view. This naturalistic viewpoint will be one which emphasizes the continuitybetween the world of ordinary experience and the reality of archetypes rather thanappealing to a radical discontinuity where the latter are centered in a supernatural ortransempirical realm transcending space and time. Looking at the archetypes from anaturalistic perspective then would mean assuming that archetypes can be fullyaccounted for within the world rather than having to appeal to what lies beyond therange of our possible experience.In spite of his speculations concerning what lies beyond space, time, and causality, it isclear that Jung's work as a whole lies already within this naturalistic attitude. This isevident from the centrality of the idea of the unus mundus in Jung's thought as a unifiedworld scheme embracing both material and spiritual phenomena. Thus, although Jungbelieved in the existence of God and the prospect of a spirit world, these beliefs are notincompatible with a naturalistic outlook. For naturalism as meant here does not have toentail materialism or the denial of any reality outside of space and time or anything notsubject to causality in the ordinary sense. There may well be more to reality than whatwe see manifested in time, space, and causality. A naturalistic perspective simplyassumes that nature will eventually yield to an intelligibility which will not need toappeal to what may exist completely outside of itself.However, the sort of reconstruction we are attempting in the following will necessarilybe more narrow in its focus than the full range of Jung's thought. In order to argue forthe scientific credibility of his theory of archetypes, we must show not only that Jung'stheory is a naturalistic one, in the most general meaning of that term, but also that thetheory is compatible in principle with standard, scientifically informed understandingsof nature. Thus, we will have to show how the essential features of the theory can beunderstood without having to rely on aspects that go beyond the scope of science or thatare incompatible with chief tenets of current scientific knowledge. in concrete termsthis will mean bracketing away from consideration the notion of synchronicity as anessential and intrinsic part of the archetypal theory. in addition it will meanunderstanding the archetypal theory in such a way that the possibility, sometimes hintedat by Jung, that archetypes might subsist separate and independent of humanconsciousness, and that the collective unconscious might thus be a superindividualentity, is clearly denied. Lastly the archetypes per se will have to be understood ashypothetical constructs rather than as ''irrepresentable table\" transcendent entities. 3The intent of the sort of naturalistic reconstruction we are attempting here is to show"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"how a theory of the collective unconscious does not have to clash with a world outlookconditioned by an assimilation of scientific knowledge. But what is really at stake inthis issue? Why is it so important"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Page 3to show that the theory can be construed as compatible with a scientifically informedperspective?In looking further at this question of the relevance of scientific compatability, it isimportant to remember that this was a concern which Jung himself shared and which heattempted to address, if even in a highly idiosyncratic fashion. Our concern with thisissue is motivated by what we perceive to be an essential guiding theme in Jung'sthought. For Jung was trying to interpret the phenomena of the archetypes in such a waythat these experiences could be assimilated by the scientifically influenced modernIntellect. By framing his theory in a way that be thought would be compatible with ascientific perspective, Jung felt this opened up the possibility of the theory being takenseriously and hence creating a link between the primordial archetypal experiences andthe modem mind set. 4 The theory of the collective unconscious was to be aninterpretation of the abiding experience of archetypes appropriate for the modem age.\"If we cannot deny the archetypes or otherwise neutralize them, we are confronted, atevery new stage in the differentiation of consciousness to which civilization attains,with the task of finding a new interpretation appropriate to this stage, in order toconnect the life of the past that still exists in us with the life of the present, whichthreatens to slip away from it.\" (Vol. 9-A, p. 157)Thus, Jung wanted to create a theoretical framework that would be instrumental inarchetypal phenomena becoming integrated into our modern world He wanted someway to demonstrate how these numinous and often spiritually inspiring mythologicalimages are really part of our experience, whether we acknowledge them or not. Jungwanted to accomplish the most essential task with which any systematic and disciplinedattempt to understand the irrational and emotionally charged archetypes would have todeal: a valid demonstration of the essential reality of the phenomena. In order toaccomplish this goal, Jung felt he needed a theoretical framework that did not directlyconflict with scientific knowledge and could even partially stake a claim to theauthority of science itself. This is an implicit acknowledgment on Jung's part thatscience has to be taken seriously in any statement concerning those things which can besaid to really exist in the world of our experience. Thus, Jung framed his theory withinthe context of scientific realism, accepting the view that the entities with which sciencedeals for the most part really succeed in describing the world rather than being merelyhelpful fictions or conventions.But even the most sympathetic appreciation of Jung's concern with the question ofscientific compatability will have to acknowledge that the kinds of experiences thatJung included within the theory of the collective unconscious are among those aspects"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of life which could well be considered as the least likely items for successful scientificscrutiny. In fact the archetypes in their numinous, symbolic, and even, at times,ineffable"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Page 4aspects seem often to point beyond words altogether toward a seemingly irreduciblemystery. These phenomena include some of the most profound and moving experiencesof life for which poetic description would seem frequently more appropriate than thevalue neutral dissecting analysis of the scientific method. It would seem that scienceand archetypes occupy different and seemingly incompatible domains ofepistemological territory.One way of dealing with this issue is to acknowledge it fully and attempt to understandthe divergence in these ways of experiencing by means of broad general categories. Forexample, we could designate the way the world is seen from the imaginative, intuitivepoint of view as conditioned by the various archetypal images as the mythos. Thecontrasting category, the logos, would be a rationally discursive perspective on theworld such as is ideally represented in the scientific attitude. We could also say that thelogos offers us a theoretical account of the world, a cognitive understanding of it,whereas the mythos discloses the world in its presence and immediacy, thereby offeringa sense of spiritual connection and the dimension of meaning. The table below gives anidea of the sort of differences of perspective that we are referring to by these terms.LogosMythossciencemysticismrationalknowledgeintuitive knowledgereasonimaginationliteral truthmetaphorical truthphilosophymythologyexpressionthroughexpression throughmanifestations ofconsciousactivitythe unconsciousThese somewhat arbitrary categories, although not employed as terms by Jung himself,offer us a convenient means to appreciate the import of the theory of the collectiveunconscious and Jung's unique contribution to understanding the phenomena itdescribes. For Jung, in articulating a theoretical framework in terms of which thearchetypal images could be understood and appreciated, was trying to create a logos ofthe mythos and thereby bring about a bridging of the two. in regard to this aim, it isimportant to bear in mind that the categories we have here labeled logos and mythoswould not have designated for Jung two separate domains of reality, a natural versus a"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"supernatural domain, for example. In terms of his ideal of a unified world picture, theunus mundus, what we are calling here \"logos\" and \"mythos\" were to be perceived asequally valid though different perspectives on the same one world. What was neededaccording to Jung's viewpoint was both an appreciation of the mythos perspective in aregrettably demythologized and desouled world as well as accountability to therationally critical functions represented by the logos point of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Page 5view. Any framework adequate to do justice to the reality of archetypes must thenmaintain this dual perspective. it would have to be open to the mythos perspective withits numinous, symbolic mysteries as well as able to withstand scientific critique.To fully appreciate the significance of Jung's ideas about what we are calling here the\"mythos-logos,\" it is helpful to see how his perspective relates to other contrastingviews. in this way the significance of the parity of emphasis Jung gives to the two polesof experience can be more fully appreciated by seeing it in relation to outlooks thatadvocate the hegemony of one of the poles over the other. In advocating a kind ofequiprimordiality of logos and mythos, Jung's outlook can be contrasted both with aperspective which devalues the mythos in relation to the logos as well as a view whichtakes Jung's appreciation of the mythos to the extreme that science itself is reduced to asubset of myth.The ideas of Ernst Cassirer can serve as representative of the first contrasting position.So far as Cassirer is concerned, the existence of a mythological level of human nature isnot in dispute. it is rather the contention that the mythos gives a deeper, truer, or evenhelpful additional view on reality that he apparently disclaims. Cassirer seesmythological conceptualizing as belonging to an earlier stage of human development Inwhich mythos and logos were not sharply differentiated but conflated together.At first the world of language, like that of myth in which it seems as it were embedded, preserves acomplete equivalence of word and thing. of \"signifer\" and \"signified\" it grows away from this equivalenceas its independent spiritual form, the characteristic force of the logos, comes to the fore. 5Beginning in the West with the early Greek philosophers and accelerated by thedevelopment of science, the process of separation of logos and mythos is hailed byCassirer as a progressive development that has the characteristic of a long and arduousstruggle for emancipation from the rationally detrimental effects of mythologicalinfluence. \"Indeed, the history of philosophy as a scientific discipline may be regardedas a single continuous struggle to effect a separation and liberation from myth.\"6Moreover, Cassirer believes that culture is continually threatened with the reversal ofthis progress of differentiation of logos and mythos. Modern humanity is threatened bya return of the pernicious influence of mythological thinking:The world of human culture may be described in the words of this Babylonian legend. It could not ariseuntil the darkness of myth was fought and overcome. But the mythical monsters were not entirelydestroyed. They were used for the creation of a new universe, and they still survive in this universe. Thepowers of myth were checked and subdued by superior forces. As long as these forces, intellectual, ethical,"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 6and artistic, are in full strength, myth is tamed and subdued. But once they begin to lose their strengthchaos is come again. Mythical thought then starts to rise anew and to pervade the whole of man's culturaland social life. 7?We cannot hope to \"rationalize\" myth by an arbitrary transformation and re-interpretation of the oldlegends of the deeds of gods or heroes. All this remains vain and futile. in order to overcome the power ofmyth we must find and develop the new positive power of \"self-knowledge.\" We must learn to see thewhole of human nature in an ethical rather than in a mythical light.8In contrast to Cassirer's view,9 Jung did not believe that the influence of the mythoseither could be completely subjugated by the logos or that the effort should be made tosubjugate it. For rather than stripping away any claims to validity or truth made onbehalf of experience from the standpoint of the mythos and seeing the mythos as merelya superstitious or animistic perversion of objective reality, Jung tries to affirm the valueof both perspectives as ways of seeing the world.One of the consequences of Jung's position is the claim that the logos and mythoscannot really be totally separated from each other. For example, he emphasized thatwhen we think we have spelled out something with absolute precision and eliminated alltraces of unconscious influence, this is never entirely the case:One may tend to dismiss such differences as redundant or expendable nuances of meaning that have littlerelevance to everyday needs. But the fact that they exist shows that even the most matter-of-fact contentsof consciousness have a penumbra of uncertainty around them. Even the most carefully definedphilosophical or mathematical concept, which we are sure does not contain more than we have put into it,is nevertheless more than we assume. it is a psychic event and as such partly unknowable.10The two modes then interpenetrate each other with the logos never completely free ofthe mythos and the mythos likewise subject to rational influence and interpretation.Thus, the effort to deny one for the sake of affirming the other must necessarily be afutile endeavor. it is clear, moreover, that it is because Jung thinks that themythological motifs are an innate and thus indispensable part of human nature that hebelieves that the mythos perspective cannot be radically overcome or discarded.This point is similar to one that could be made with respect to metaphor. For Jung'sview presupposes a position on metaphor which assumes that language cannot bepurged of metaphor without catastrophic loss of referential function. Metaphor will beseen as permeating all languages and cannot be eliminated in favor of completely literaldiscourse. Moreover, myths can themselves be seen as extended metaphors so that thearchetypes could then be understood as an innate set of"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Page 7basic metaphors in terms of which humans can see the world. Just as language cannot befreed from metaphor, so also human nature cannot be purified of archetypal perspectiveand mythological influence. As an innate aspect of human nature, the mythos willalways be present either in overt or disguised form.Having an access to the mythos, moreover, is essential from the standpoint of providinghuman existence with a sense of meaning and purpose. According to Jung we needsymbols that are capable of mediating the experience of the archetypes. if we think ofreligion in terms of our scheme of mythos and logos, this particular point becomesclear. We might think that religion would belong to the mythos side, and this is indeedthe source of the archetypal images from which religious revelation springs. However,once in consciousness, the archetyal images are interpreted and integrated intoconsciously elaborated theological and dogmatic frameworks. In the course of time, theoriginal symbols, which were vehicles for channeling the mythos, may become \"dead\"symbols where they cease to mediate the archetypal images and become mere signs.They cease to help us to apprehend or experience the mythos and become merelyadditional aspects of our conscious experience. Thus, when religion becomes logos,completely rationalized with all of its mysteries literalized, it does not function anyloner as mediator of the mythos, and we begin to see less and less meaning and point inthe whole enterprise.If religion is denied totally, however, this does not mean that we have discarded themythos, that the mythos vanishes without trace. For in that case some other system ofbelief may begin to take over the function of mediating the mythos. One may, forexample, come to be an adherent of some political ideology such as communism, whichis replete with such myths as the eventual withering away of the state in the coming ofthe golden age.There is in the psyche some superior power, and if it is not consciously a god, it is the \"belly\" at least, in St.Paul's words. I therefore consider it wiser to acknowledge the idea of God consciously, for, if we do not,something else is mad God, usually something quite inappropriate and stupid such as only an\"enlightened\" intellect could hatch forth. (Vol. 7, p. 7l)According to Jung's view, if we acknowledge the function of a mythic dimension tohuman existence, then we have a better chance of modifying it with rationalconsiderations. Moreover, once the mythos is acknowledged there is then less chance ofconfusing it with the logos. This is closely analogous to consciously acknowledging thata particular way of speaking is a metaphor and thereby avoiding the risk of taking one'smodels of the world for the world itself; it is to avoid the problem of confusing the mapwith the territory. This acknowledgment of the mythos"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Page 8also has the major additional advantage of enabling one to see the limitations of aparticular mythos perspective. Once a particular viewpoint is understood to be a modelor extended metaphor, we are then alerted to the built-in limitations of looking at realitytoo exclusively in terms of this conception. This creates the possibility of a critiquefrom the logos perspective, that is, the possibility of a rational critique.The net result of not attempting to eliminate the tension between mythos and logos bydevaluing one in favor of the other is to maintain a dual perspective on the world. Bothare seen as necessary and important modes of cognizing with nonoverlapping functions.The potential imaginative sterility and nihilism of a logos alienated from the mythos isovercome. On the other hand, the mythos is not left completely free of rational critique.Although the logos cannot replace the mythos, it can prevent the mythos fromoverstepping its own legitimate bounds by insisting on literality, facts, and empiricalgrounds whenever appropriate. In this way the mythos is then made partiallyaccountable to the logos.Jung's perspective on the mythos-logos, in contrast to a view such as Cassirerrepresents, has the net result of advocating the value of the mythos in relation to thelogos. However, Jung's outlook also needs to be contrasted with the ideas of someonelike James Hillman. 11 For Hillman has taken up the cause of the mythos and attemptedto understand all experience in terms of it. Rather than aiming for a logos of the mythosas did Jung, Hillman wants to articulate a mythos of the logos. For rather thanattempting to develop a scientific approach to the archetypes, he advocates that we seescience from the viewpoint of archetypes:In fact, the categories of logic and number, of science and theology, could themselves be reduced (i.e., ledback) to more basic metaphors of myth. No concepts, no matter how general and abstract, could embracethe range of these archetypal metaphors.12By psychologizing scientific problems, methods, and hypotheses we can find their archetypal fantasies.13Since he sees all psychology as depth psychology,14 it is not surprising that Hillmandoes not recognize psychology as properly a science:In order to move toward a nonagnostic psychology we must first see through psychology's dominant beliefin itself as a science. Clearly, from the ideas we have been shaping, archetypal psychology does notimagine itself or the psyche as belonging to science, even social or behavioral science.15Hillman's program is thus best described as a relativizing of the logos by seeing it as alimited part of the mythos.In contrasting Hillman and Jung's views on the mythos and logos, the fundamentaldifferences hinge on the question of how broadly to apply the"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Page 9archetypal theory. Jung, in contrast to Hillman, wants to keep the archetypal theorygrounded in the scientific attitude rather than using the theory as a sort of ideologicaldevice to critique all experience including science itself. The advantage that Jung'sposition offers is the prospect of creating bridges between the tradition of scientificknowledge and archetypal experience. By trying to approach the archetypes in ascientific spirit, Jung opens himself up to the results of critical and rational inquiry, thatis, he makes his theory accountable to the logos point of view. This accountabilityoffers the possibility of making archetypal experience an integral aspect of the modernworld. For the logos accountability offers the prospect of a mythos appreciation whichcan be taken seriously without the necessity of having to subscribe to a philosophicalviewpoint that argues for epistemological priority of the archetypal theory. Thus, inJung's position, the logos perspective can maintain its autonomy and hence its criticalfunction in relation to the mythos rather than being reductively \"swallowed\" anddepotentiated by an all-inclusive mythos emphasis.This contrast with other views has been undertaken in order to develop Jung's positionon the mythos and logos as a key to understanding how his theory of archetypes can beseen in a scientific perspective. However, our discussion of the relevance ofcompatibility with a scientific point of view, of bridging the logos and mythos whichJung's emphasis on mythos and logos seems to entail, is still lacking an importantaspect. Before the relevance of the question of scientific compatibility can be definitelyestablished, we have to show how the extrascientific aspects of Jung's writings aboutarchetypes can be reconciled with the intention to have the theory perceived within ascientific context.For in addition to the tendency to accommodate his ideas about archetypes to ascientific perspective, there is also the tendency to want to go outside of a scientificviewpoint or beyond science such as we see in Answer to Job and the writings onsynchronicity. And how are we to discriminate those aspects of Jung's writings whichseem to be outside the scope of science, or to be even potential embarrassments to ascientific outlook, without grossly distorting the actual intent of Jung's work on thecollective unconscious as a whole?In this regard it is important to bear in mind that Jung was involved with archetypalexperience on both a mythos as well as a logos level. Thus, an essay such as Answer toJob was not intended as a scientific work, nor was it perceived as such by Jung. 16Rather it was an attempt to wrestle with the mythos of the God archetype and interpretit for the modern era. Job is then at the object-level of the mythos rather than the meta-level. From the standpoint of his therapeutic commitment, Jung had to be involved at"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the object-level of myth because it is from involvement with the mythos that hebelieved that the patient's healing sprang. Thus, it is not surprising that Jung has a stakein an articulation of both the mythos as well as the logos"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Page 10of archetypes, although his style of exposition easily leads to confusion when he rapidlyswitches from a mythos to a logos discourse and back again.Concerning synchronicity there is an attempt to develop a notion complementary toscience. For synchronicity is supposed to deal with acausal events. it also calls intoquestion the reality of space and time in discussion of events that are supposed toinvolve a relativizing of space and time as ordinarily understood. At this point it seemsthat Jung was attempting to grapple with phenomena that he could not conceive asfitting into a scientific scheme of understanding. This tendency to want to go beyondscience and talk in terms of a broader framework of which science would be one partalso can be seen manifested in Jung's discussion of psychical phenomena such as ESPand spirit manifestations and hints, open to various interpretations, concerning thesubsistence of archetypal entities independent of human minds. 17In spite of Jung's self-description as an empiricist, the sorts of ideas mentioned aboveclearly indicate a speculative bent to Jung's thinking which, particularly in the later partof his life, led him in an unmistakenly philosophical direction. The value of thesethought-provoking and insightful contributions are not negated if we insist on a separatetreatment of these apart from what can be defended as a legitimately scientificdimension to Jung's work. They remain valuable contributions in their own right. Butoften when Jung is dealing directly with the mythos, as in Job, they confuse the readeras to what Jung is aiming for, and as to the basis upon which the ideas rest. Theastrological \"experiments\" discussed in the essay on synchronicity are an infamous casein point as they leave the reader to wonder what sort of experimental proof Jung seemsto be after and whether such things are even possible for so-called acausal events. Buteven though there are these many strains of Jung's thoughta philosophical emphasis, amythos emphasis, as well as a scientific emphasisthis is not to say that everything lungsaid has to be evaluated from the critical standpoint of any one particular point of view.For it is the thesis of this work to show that in spite of the confusion that Jung createsby working over his material from these methodologically divergent perspectives, alegitimately scientific perspective can nonetheless be reconstructed from his thought.18It may seem somewhat paradoxical to defend Jung's ideas from the point of view oforthodox and traditional ways of trying to understand the world when in fact Jung's\"science,\" such as it is, does not fit neatly into the ideal of what science should be, ifthis ideal is taken from the natural sciences as a model. However, we have to be wary offalling into the trap of trying to make psychology scientific by modeling it on analready outmoded concept of science, as it could be argued the behaviorists have donein their emulation of classical Newtonian physics. Jung's scientific method is"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"descriptive and phenomenological and it is part of the"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Page 11pioneering element in his thought to attempt to legitimate alternative ways of scientificinvestigation in the human sciences in the face of the prohibitive difficulties ofemploying experimental methods with regard to archetypal phenomena. Therefore theendeavor to argue for a consideration of a genuine scientific aspect of Jung's workshould not be understood as an effort to contort Jung's imaginative and symbolic ideasonto a procrustean bed of outdated scientific orthodoxy. Jung's science alreadyencorporates a brave new vision of what it means to be scientific which owes a greatdeal to the inspiration of relativity and quantum physics.But if it is acknowledged that Jung's understanding of what it means to be scientificalready embodies a nonrestrictive notion of science and is compatible with a non-Newtonian physics, this still does not complete the argument for the importance of areconstruction from the scientific perspective which deliberately brackets out thespeculative element of Jung's thought. For when we acknowledge that Jung's ideas areout on the growing fringe of science, this still does not effectively counter those whosee Jung's aim as being primarily to transcend the spectrum of scientific thoughtaltogether. For a critic might argue that in reconstructing Jung's idea of archetypes fromthe standpoint of a scientific outlook, we are in effect cutting out of the theory theprogressive aspects of it where Jung was beginning to grope toward a new vision ofreality transcending the limiting scope of scientific method. Why not, for example,assimilate Jung's theory of the archetypes to such speculative theses as David Bohm'simplicit and explicit orders 19 or Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance20 byway of acknowledging that this was the sort of thing that Jung was trying to say allalong? Like Jung in his speculative mode, Bohm and Sheldrake seem to be attemptingto talk about what lies beyond the scope of time and space as we ordinarily understandthem. Both Bohm and Sheldrake seem to be groping toward the formulation of a trulytransempirical notion of reality such that what happens outside of time and space asordinarily understood is the initiating impetus for the phenomena that we observe in thespace-time world. Thus, Bohm and Sheldrake could be seen as working toward whatamounts to a spiritualist account of reality, if we mean that to describe realitiesgrounded in realms beyond space and time.But it just will not do to turn Jung's archetypes into such a spiritualist view. For thearchetypal theory is preeminently a psychological theory talking about thosephenomena which fall within the range of human experience- it is a theory about whattranspires within the space-time world, as the mythos that Jung is endeavoring to makesense of is very much within the world.21 Jung did indeed hold to beliefs in ultimatespiritual realities, what we could call the \"Mythos,\" which stand as it were beyond thesymbols and images of the mythos.

But it seems to be a surer way to progress along thepathway to such a goal to take a theoretically conservative course starting from whatcan be relatively agreed on as known and gradually expanding the horizon of that toinclude more of the previously unknown rather than to assume the irrelevance ofscientific knowledge in favor of ungrounded and sweeping speculative views.The case of psychic phenomena, a consideration of which was the main impetus behindJung's speculative forays beyond the scope of science, serves to illustrate this point.Precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, out-of-body experience, and related events,if they are truly what they seem to be, violate several assumptions of the common senseworld of which science is in some ways a sophisticated extension. Precognition, forexample, seems to indicate backward causation in time where a future event causes apresent premonition. Out-of-body consciousness, experienced by those under deepanesthesia and in other unconscious states, seems to violate the ordinary assumptionswe make about the dependence of consciousness on certain brain states. In these eventsare indeed what they appear to be, this might well indicate that the world is notcompletely and adequately described by the working assumptions with which sciencedeals, and that perhaps there is in fact a spiritual background to the everyday world withthese psychic events being only, as it were, little windows from our ordinary experienceinto a vastly different reality.But the theory that would explain these events, if it is going to be the unifying theorywhich we seek, must also account for the mundane and garden variety phenomena withwhich science already deals as special and limiting cases of some wider picture ofreality. it would not help to have a theory that accounted for psychic events, but whichfailed to explain the ordinary and the everyday. Before a new visionary theoreticalsynthesis can be achieved, it has to be preceded by attempts to integrate the anomalousevents into the already existing framework of knowledge. Only when such an effort hascompletely run its course can the anomalies, in their persistent perversity with respectto standard ways of understanding, eventually necessitate a rethinking of basicassumptions. 22Thus, even if the archetypes did eventually prove to be the sort of entities the fullunderstanding of which necessitated alterations in some of our basic assumptions aboutthe world, this change would have to be one grounded in an exhaustive effort to fit"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"archetypal phenomena into a traditional scientific perspective.23But before we can even begin to think in terms of such a grand metaphysical unificationof the spiritual and the scientific, the preliminary"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Page 13task remains of exploring and demonstrating the reality of archetypes in our everydayexperience. Just as J. B. Rhine's pioneering work at Duke University has changed thestudy of psychic phenomena from collecting interesting antedotes to a respectedscientific field studying real features of the world, so analogously we need to show howa scientifically credible archetypal theory is possible so that the reality of archetypescan be decisively demonstrated. This demonstration opens the door to the prospect ofillustrating the relevance of the theory to other branches of knowledge. With a firmgrounding in the logos aspect, the mythos of the archetypal theory can come into itsown. The reality and inescapability of a mythic dimension of human existence will thenhave been made evident.With the naturalistic reconstructive approach we are taking in this study, we hope thento create the possibility for a critical assessment of the archetypal theory.

In this regard, it will be helpful to see Jung's views on this matter withinthe context of his psychology as a whole. However, within the scope of this study, wecannot attempt to trace the relationship between all of Jung's views and the archetypes.A principal omission in this regard is Jung's theory of individuation where he attemptsto examine the role which the archetypes play in the derelict of personality.But if we cannot consider all of Jung's ideas that are related to the archetypal theory, itis essential to gain an understanding of his mental constructs. Thus, as a preliminary todiscussing the archetypal theory itself, we will examine these concepts. Our approach inthis regard will be to begin with the mental constructs of the widest application. Wewill consider first, then, the most general of the Jungian mentalistic terms, the psyche.Psyche-Body RelationWe find that an attempt to gain a clear idea of just what Jung means by the psyche runsinto immediate difficult. For Jung's psyche is both a primitive as well as a central termin his psychology. The psyche, its contents, structure, and dynamics is that about whichJung's psychology is primarily concerned. It is not surprising, then, that when Jungaddresses himself to the specific task of characterizing the psychic as distinct from thenonpsychic, his characterization fails to satisfy us as a definition, leading instead to adiscussion of the relationship of the psyche to other basic Jungian concepts.We should not expect a definition of the psyche from Jung in any case since, accordingto his view, the psyche mediates all experience so that there is a sense in which it can besaid that we cannot get outside of the"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Page 16psyche in order to examine what it might be in itself: ''...there is no standpoint above oroutside psychology that would enable us to form an ultimate judgment of what thepsyche is.\" (Man and His Symbols, p. 47)But if we are not to find a precise definition of the psyche in Jung's writings, we stillneed to determine the relation between Jung's idea of the psyche and traditionalconcepts in the philosophy of mind. For if Jung avoids explicit concern withphilosophical issues, there is nonetheless an implicit theory of mind at work in hiswritings an understanding of which will help us to grasp the unifying theoreticalelement present in Jung's discussions of the psyche. Thus, before attempting to discussJung's characterization of the psyche in the subsequent section where we will see howJung operationally distinguishes the psychic from the nonpsychic and places the psychein perspective within his psychology as a whole, we will examine the use of the termpsyche in contexts that highlight Jung's position on the question of reductionism and themind-body relation. By such a strategy we attempt to gain a theoretical overview ofJung's psychological constructs which can serve as a guide to Jung's discussion of theconstructs themselves.At a first approximation, then, we will consider the psyche as roughly equivalent tomind 1 and discuss the problem of the intended relation between psyche and body inJung's writings from the perspective of reductionism. Reductionism seems to be apromising approach to Jung's outlook on the mind-body as Jung likes to consider thepsyche in terms of a system of energy relations, using \"libido\" to designate the psychicenergy.2 This energetic viewpoint seems to suggest either a reductionist position inwhich the psyche, understood as physical energy, is seen as reducible tophysicochemical terms or else a vitalist position in which a special type of mind energyis postulated. Thus, a materialist identity thesis in this case of reductionism or asubstantial dualism in the case of vitalism seem to be possible mind-body positions thatsuggest themselves as alternative views to which Jung might be thought to subscribe.3The possibility that Jung might be taking a reductive position is suggested by the factthat the purpose of the energetic standpoint is to enable the psychologist to understandphenomena in such terms as entropy, conservation of energy, and equilization ofdifferences in an analogous way to the manner in which physical phenomena can beunderstood. Thus, Jung believes that the concept of libido \"accomplishes for psychologythe same advance that the concept of energy introduced into physics.\" (Vol. 4, p. 112)In the absence of any methods of exact measurement of the energy, quantitativeestimations can be reached through appeal to the system of psychological values, as thevalue intensity of psychological phenomena will be held to be a quantitative estimate of"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"the amount of psychic energy involved. (Vol. 8, p. 9)However, Jung makes clear that the analogy between physical energy"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Page 17and psychic energy cannot be taken in too literal a sense:...in spite of the nonmeasurability of psychic processes, the perceptible changes effected by the psychecannot possibly be understood except as a phenomenon of energy. This places the psychologist in asituation which is highly repugnant to the physicist: the psychologist also talks of energy although he hasnothing measurable to manipulate, besides which the concept of energy is a strictly defined mathematicalquantity which cannot he applied as such to anything psychic If psychology nevertheless insists onemploying its own concept of energy for the purpose of expressing the activity...of the psyche, it is not ofcourse being used as a mathematical formula, but only as its analogy. (Vol. 8, p. 233)Jung's energetic standpoint is then obviously not an attempt to bring about a reductionof psychology to psychophysics. Jung insists on the autonomous position of psychologyin relation to other sciences:Since, unfortunately, we cannot prove scientifically that a relation of equivalence exists between physicaland psychic energy, we have no alternative except either to drop the energetic viewpoint altogether, or elseto postulate a special psychic energywhich would be entirely possible as a hypothetical operation.Psychology as much as physics may avail itself of the right to build its own concepts,...(Vol. 8, pp. 15-16)But this characterization of libido as a \"special psychic energy\" would seem to imply avitalist position. This suspicion seems confirmed when we read: \"From a broaderstandpoint libido can be understood as vital energy in general, or as Bergson's élanvital,\" (Vol. 4, p. 248) and \"...we would probably do best to regard the psychic processsimply as a life-process. In this way we enlarge the narrower concept of psychic energyto a broader one of life-energy, which includes 'psychic energy' as a specific part.\" (Vol.8, p. 17)However, Jung makes clear that \"this broader standpoint\" is a hypothetical andproblematic one. 4 in order to maintain its functional autonomy, psychology must notconflate its concept of psychic energy with a possible biological concept of vitalenergy:I have therefore suggested that, in view of the psychological use we intend to make of it, we call ourhypothetical life-energy \"libido.\" To this extent I have differentiated it from a concept of universal energy,so maintaining the right of biology and psychology to form their own concepts. (Vol. 8, p. l7)There is also an explicit disclaimer of the concept of vitalism: \"We shall not bedisturbed if we are met with the cry of vitalism. We are as far removed from any beliefin a specific life-force as from any other metaphysical assertion.\" (Vol. 4, p. 125)"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Page 18We can see, then, that in regard to the question of reductionism, Jung wants to avoidcommitment to either reductionism or vitalism. Jung's stand on this issue can then bestbe characterized as de facto antireductionist. Rather than attempting to defend the apriori nonreduction of psychological phenomena to physics or chemistry, Jung holds toa de facto antireductionism. This nonreduction as a matter of fact is supportable by theavailable empirical evidence and is strictly speaking neutral with respect to the issue ofreduction in principle.With regard to reductionism, it would seem clear that Jung wants to hold operationallyto a nonreductionist view while leaving open the possibility that psyche and body mightbe shown to be different features of an ontologically homogeneous organismic totality.This approach of acknowledging a duality from an operational point of view whileadhering to a theoretical unity can also be shown to be characteristic of Jung's positionon the mind-body relation as a whole where there is discernible a dualistic as well as amonistic emphasis.However, our discussion of the reductionism issue, while serving as a preview to Jung'streatment of the problem of mind-body relation, still leaves many questionsunanswered. For if we are to show that the key to understanding Jung's view on thismatter is gaining an insight into the tension between the monistic and dualisticemphases of his thought, it still remains to be made clear how dualism and monism canbe reconciled within one intelligible theoretical framework. Moreover, the monisticpole of Jung's thought must be further explored; since from the previous discussion ofreductionism, it is still unclear how Jung is to be defended from a claim of adhering to asubstantial dualism, that is, how the dual phenomenological perspective which Junginsists on does not amount in the final analysis to substantial dualism.In order to gain a satisfactory answer to these questions about Jung's theory of mind, wemust approach the problem of the mind-body relation in Jung's thought from theperspective of Jung's phenomenological strategy. For, as we have seen in the case ofreductionism, Jung wants to take into account in his psychology both aspects of themind-body relation, that is, the relationship of the physical body to the mind as well asthe phenomenologically distinctive characteristics of mental activity. Moreover, thesense of taking into account at work here is that of not explaining away one of the twoaspects by exclusive appeal to the other.We must be able to appeal to an explanatory principle founded on reality, and yet it is no longer possiblefor the modem psychologist to take his stand exclusively on the physical aspect of reality once he hasgiven the spiritual aspect its due. Nor will he be able to put weight on the latter alone, for he cannot ignorethe relative validity of the physical aspect.

Rather Jung is attempting to formulate an operational outlook that will bebroad and flexible enough to encompass the full range of psychological phenomenawithout arbitrarily excluding data on the grounds of narrow theoretical considerations.Jung's favorite way of expressing his standpoint on the mind-body relation is thus toemphasize the necessity of an essentially phenomenologicla orientation. For, fromJung's perspective, if we concentrate our attention on the psychic images themselvesrather than seeking to investigate their ultimate ontological referents, we arrive at anoperational point of view in terms of which the problematic of mind-body as it isordinarily understood should not arise. \"If I shift my concept of reality on to the planeof the psychewhere alone it is validthis puts an end to the conflict between mind andmatter, spirit and nature, as contradictory explanatory principles.\" (Vol. 8, p. 353)Taking Jung's writings into account as a whole, however, it becomes evident that theappeal to a phenomenological perspective does not eliminate the necessity forarticulating a position on the mind-body relation that has definite theoreticalimplications. That is to say, Jung is unable to strictly adhere to his phenomenologicalprogram and does in fact make statements which disclose a distinctive theoreticaloutlook on the mind-body relation. Moreover, an understanding of this theoreticalviewpoint is essential in order to gain a comprehension of Jung's notion of the psyche asa whole. For in order to be able to follow Jung's reasoning throughout the discussion ofthe psyche from many different perspectives, it is essential to be able to see theseperspectives as for the most part different theoretical emphases of a single viewpoint.Taking a look at a representative sample of those passages in which Jung takes atheoretical stand on the mind-body relation, then, we discover that Jung wants to adhereboth to an interactionist view as well as a panpsychist double aspect account. 5 in thefollowing passages from Jung's works, we find these views clearly expressed:Matter therefore would contain the seed of spirit and spirit the seed of matter....The \"psychization\" ofmatter puts the absolute immateriality of spirit in question, since this would then have to be accorded akind of substantiality. (Vol. 9-A, p. 109) [Panpsychism-double aspect account]...all reality would be grounded on an as yet unknown substrate possessing material and at the same timepsychic qualities. (Vol. 10, p. 411) [Double aspect account]The materialistic premise is that the physical process usably determines the psychic process. Thespiritualistic premise is the reverse of this. I think of this relationship in the physical sense as a reciprocalone, in which now one side and now the other acts as a cause. One could also say that under certainconditions the physical process reflects itself in the psychic, just as the psychic does in the physical.(Letters, Vol. 1, p. 366, letter to Markus Flerz dated 7 May 1945) [Interactionism]"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Page 20That even the psychic world, which is so extraordinarily different from the physical world, does not haveits roots outside the one cosmos is evident from the undeniable fact that causal connections exist betweenthe psyche and the body which point to their underlying unitary nature. (Vol. 14, p. 538) [Double aspectaccount-interactionism]Since psyche and matter are contained in one and the same world, and moreover are in continuous contactwith one another and ultimately rest on irrepresentable, transcendental factors, it is not only possible butfairly probable, even, that psyche and matter are two different aspects of one and the same thing. (Vol. 8,215) [Double aspect account]Mind and body are presumably a pair of opposites and, as such, the expression of a single entity whoseessential nature is not knowable either from its outward, material manifestation or from inner, directperception.... This living being appears outwardly as the material body, but inwardly as a series of imagesof the vital activities taking place within it. They are two sides of the same coin, and we cannot ridourselves of the doubt that perhaps this whole separation of mind and body may finally prove to be merelya device of reason for the purpose of conscious discriminationan intellectually necessary separation of oneand the same fact into two aspects, to which we then illegitimately attribute an independent existence. (Vol.8, p. 326) [Double aspect account]From a consideration of the above quotations, the solution to the puzzle of how thedualistic and monistic emphases in Jung's mind-body outlook are to be reconciledpresents itself. For it is clear that Jung does not consider the two referents involved inthe interactionistic view as ontologically distinct substances or as corresponding tofundamentally different orders of nature. The interaction involved can then beunderstood as intrasystematic interaction involving two phenomenologically distinctaspects of one and the same ontological system. Rather than understanding thephenomenological duality of mental and physical within a Cartesian-like framework ofseparate substances, then, Jung sees this duality as a manifestation of an underlyingunity.Except for some notable exceptions to be considered below, the conception of Jung'stheory of mind with its emphasis on a duality of phenomenological perspectivesconceived within a monistic theoretical framework serves us as the theoretical guide weare seeking in order to gain an appreciation of the essential unity of Jung's view of thepsyche. Thus, even when Jung talks about the possibility of \"psychoid\" processesoperating outside the psyche or discusses his theory of synchronicity, it is clear howwhat Jung says on these topics can be easily accommodated in principle within hisinteractionist and panpsychist double aspect view. 6...the \"psychoid\" and essentially transcendental nature of the archetype as an \"arranger\" of psychic formsinside and outside the psyche.

(Vol.8, p. 515)In so far as both modalities, archetype and synchronicity, belong primarily to the realm of the psychic, weare justified in concluding that they are psychic phenomena. In so far, however, as synchronistic eventsinclude not only psychic but also physical forms of manifestation, the conclusion is justified that bothmodalities transcend the realm of the psychic and somehow also belong to the physical realm. (Letters,Vol. 2, p. 447, letter to Karl Schmid dated 11 June 1958)That there is no essential theoretical discontinuity between these later developments ofJung's idea of the psyche and Jung's theory of mind as just outlined is due, then, to thefact that Jung's theory of mind with its panpsychist double aspect perspective alreadyemphasizes an essential continuity between mind and matter. Thus, the \"'psychization'of matter,\" that is, the possibility that psychic attributes might occur in contexts outsidethe psyche itself is already compatible with the theoretical framework evidenced byJung's earliest writings about the mind-body relation.But while it may be possible to identify an underlying theoretical unity in the manydifferent passages where Jung discusses his views of the psyche and the psyche-bodyrelation, this is not to say that there are not some passages that cannot be satisfactorilyreconciled with the Jungian theory of mind we have outlined above. These previouslymentioned exceptions concern Jung's ideas on synchronicity and ESP, out-of-bodyexperiences, and survival of bodily death.With regard to synchronicity, although we can understand how Jung's reflections on thismatter are a natural development of his theoretical model of the psyche, Jung appears toreach some provisional conclusions in discussions of synchronicity that are inconsistentwith his views as a whole. For even though due to Jung's habit of discussing points ofview in a hypothetical way, the reader must beware of concluding from a few isolatedpassages that Jung actually adheres to a controversial position; it nevertheless seems tobe the case that Jung seriously considered a parallelistic model of mind-body relation asa consequence of his thoughts on synchronicity:I must again stress the possibility that the relation between body and soul may yet be understood as asynchronistic one. Should this conjecture ever be proved, my present view that synchronicity is a relativelyrare phenomenon would have to be corrected. (Vol. 8, p. 500, note 70)... we must ask ourselves whether the relation of soul and body can be considered from this angle, that is tosay whether the coordination of psychic and physical processes in a living organism can be understood as"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Page 22a synchronistic phenomenon rather than as a causal relation. (Vol. 8, p. 505)Jung apparently felt that the parallelistic model of mind-body relation might benecessary to account for ESP phenomena which Jung understood as synchronisticevents. in general synchronicity with its emphasis on the meaningful but noncausalconnection between psychic and physical events tended to undermind the concept of thepsyche as necessarily dependent on the brain or on a material substrate. Thus we findJung making such statements as the following.We must completely give up the idea of the psyche's being somehow connected with the brain, andremember instead the \"meaningful\" or \"intelligent\" behaviour of the lower organisms, which are without abrain. Here we find ourselves much closer to the formal factor [synchronicity] which, as I have said, hasnothing to do with brain activity. (vol. 8, p. 505)Similar conclusions are reached in speculations about life after death and out-of-bodyexperiences:We may establish with reasonable certainty [at death] that an individual consciousness as it relates toourselves has come to an end. But whether this means that the continuity of the psychic process is alsointerrupted remains doubtful, since the psyche's attachment to the brain can be affirmed with far lesscertitude today than it could fifty years ago. Psychology must first digest certain parapsychological facts,which it has hardly begun to do as yet (Vol. 8, p. 412)These experiences [out-of-body experiences] seem to show that in swoon states, where by all humanstandards there is every guarantee that conscious activity and sense perception are suspended,consciousness, reproducible ideas, acts of judgment, and perceptions can still continue to exist.... If we arecorrect in this assumption, then we must ask ourselves whether there is some other nervous substrate in us,apart from the cerebrum, that can think and perceive, or whether the psychic processes that go on in usdining loss of consciousness are synchronistic phenomena, i.e., events which have no causal connectionwith organic processes. (Vol. 8, p. 509)In light of the ontologically monistic theory of mind we have claimed for him, it seemshard to understand how Jung could arrive at such conclusions which seem stronglyimplicated with a substantial dualism. However, it is not difficult to retrace the steps ofJung's reasoning on these points. Jung starts from the data of ESP and synchronisticphenomena Accepting the descriptions of ESP phenomena as genuine events, Jung triesto understand them in the context of his theory of synchronicity by seeing the ESPphenomena as instances of synchronicity. Jung then reasons that a psychic relativity ofspace and time has been demonstrated in these cases since events seem to take placeindependently of our"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Page 23conventional understanding of the limitations of space and time. For example, Jungcites evidence that telepathy is not significantly effected by changes in distancesbetween participating subjects. (Vol. 8, p. 433) Moreover, the phenomenon ofprecognition seems to indicate the existence of a situation in which our ordinary senseof time has been suspended.With the hypothesis of the psychic relativity of space and time, the significance ofconsidering ESP phenomena as instances of synchronicity becomes clear. For if a causalexplanation of these events is ruled out, as it is in the theory of synchronicity, then atheoretically radical explanation, such as psychic relativity of space and time, seems tobe required:The \"absolute knowledge\" which is characteristic of synchronistic phenomena, a knowledge not mediatedby the sense organs, supports the hypothesis of a self-subsistent meaning. or even expresses its existence.Such a form of existence can only be transcendental, since, as the knowledge of future or spatially distantevents shows, it is contained in a psychically relative space and time, that is to say in an irrepresentablespace-time continuum. (Vol. 8, p. 506)Jung concludes that since under some circumstances the psyche can apparently operateoutside of our conventional conception of space and time, there is then the distinctpossibility of a condition in which the psyche is not bound by space and time at all:The fact that extra-sensory perception is real proves that time and space are psychically relative. Thatmeans that they can be more or less annihilated. If that is the case, an extreme also is possible where timeand space don't exist at all. If a thing is capable of non-existence then we must assume that it is alsocapable of absolute existence. (Letters, Vol. 1, p. 421, letter to Laurence J. Bendit dated 20 April 1946)Jung is easy prey for the critic here since the assimilation of ESP to Jung's theory ofsynchronicity is questionable at best. Moreover, the theory of synchronicity itself isopen to major criticism independently of the issue of its connection with ESP (see page150, notes 18 and 19). Lastly, the dubious move from the psychic relativity of space andtime to the condition of \"absolute existence\" outside space and time needs at least to beargued for in a more convincing way than the merest hints which JungHowever, if Jung in his pioneering efforts to come to an understanding of the completerange of psychic manifestations did on occasion reach provisional conclusions whichprove on careful analysis to have an anomalous relationship to his psychology as awhole, this is not a legitimate basis for the conclusion that Jung had no cob eat andconsistent theory of mind. For in order to understand the relationship between what wemight call Jung's \"standard theory of mind\" (interaction-ism"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Page 24and panpsychist double aspect theory) and the passages which cannot be satisfactorilyreconciled with this position, the sort of distinction we must bear in mind is thatbetween a well-worked-out and empirically grounded concept, the notion of the psycheas embodied and closely tied to the functioning of the brain, versus tentative,provisional efforts to see how this outlook could be expanded, or perhaps revised inorder to take into account the full range of extraordinary psychological phenomena. 7For the purpose of reconstructing Jung's views, then, we will set aside the statementsquoted above where Jung speculates about a psyche which functions relativelyindependently of a brain and of quasi-psychic functions which operate synchronisticallyin physical nature. Thus, we will reconstruct Jung's theory of archetypes from theperspective of what we have called his standard theory of mind.Characterization of the PsycheKeeping these theoretical considerations about the mind-body relation in mind, we cannow proceed to a discussion of Jung's characterization of the psyche. Thischaracterization is to serve us as the basis for an operational understanding of thepsyche so that we can see the relationship of the psyche to the other Jungian mentalconstructs. Although from Jung's point of view we cannot strictly delimit the psyche:\"... no one knows what 'psyche' is, and one knows just as little how far into nature'psyche' extends,\" (Vol. 8, p. 409) it is nonetheless possible to describe thephenomenological difference between the psychic and nonpsychic and thus arrive at asort of operational definition.Jung says then that: \"What I would call the psyche proper extends to all functions whichcan be brought under the influence of a will.\" (Vol. 8, p. 183) Moreover, by will isunderstood a form of disposable energy. (vol. 8, pp. 182-183) The sort of workingmodel that emerges from this characterization, then, is a separation of the psyche andthe truly psychological from the instincts and the only physiological in terms of thepossibility of modification or flexibility in the otherwise rigid dynamisms ofphysiological compulsion.An example of what is meant by the nonpsychic in terms of animal life is perhapsinstructive. For in consideration of the insect world, there seem to be no exceptions tothe rigid physiological determinism of behavior. An insect is essentially a physiologicalautomaton. However, as we consider more complex forms of organisms with morecentralized nervous systems, the hypothesis of the existence of at least a rudimentaryform of consciousness becomes more probable. With the higher mammals, theexistence of psychological processes becomes evident. Thus, Jung explicitly affirms the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"existence of psychic processes in dogs and domestic animals. (Vol. 8, pp. 173 and 189)For Jung, then, the psyche is not restricted to humankind but only finds its greatestdevelopment there as the outcome of a continuous developmental sequence of gradualphylogenetic"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Page 25phylogenetic emergence.In specifying the relationship between the instincts and the psyche, then, the instinctsare conceived to be ectopsychic in origin. Jung summarizes his argument on this pointin the following way:If we started with the hypothesis that the psyche is absolutely identical with the state of being alive, thenwe should have to accept the existence of a psychic function even in unicellular organisms....But if we look upon the appearance of the psyche as a relatively recent event in evolutionary history, andassume that the psychic function is a phenomenon accompanying a nervous system which in some way orother has become centralized, then it would be difficult to believe that the instincts were originally psychicin nature. And since the connection of the psyche with the brain is a more probable conjecture than thepsychic nature of life in general, I regard the characteristic compulsiveness of instinct as an ectopsychicfactor. (Vol. 8, p. 115)In stating that instincts are ectopsychic, Jung does not of course wish to deny apsychological aspect to instinctual phenomena; and thus he wishes to make clear thatthe instincts can be considered from two points of view: as they appear inconsciousness, their psychic impact, as it were, and as physiological stimuli:Instinct as an ectopsychic factor would play the role of a stimulus merely, while instinct as a psychicphenomenon would be an assimilation of this stimulus to a preexistent psychic pattern. A name is neededfor this process. I should term it psychization. Thus, what we call instinct offhand would be a datumalready psychized, but of ectopsychic origin. (Vol. 8, p. 115)A further clarification of Jung's model of the psyche comes into play when thisambiguous interlace region between the psychological and the physiological isexplicitly considered. For the psychological phenomena associated with the disposableenergy of the will are, according to Jung's model, merely the end of a continuum withthe physiological at one end and the psychic at the other. However, in the middle of thiscontinuum, Jung identifies psychoid functions that are quasi-psychic yet not merelyphysiological. Instincts are examples of these psychoid phenomena which, though notpsychic in the full sense of Jung's designation, yet have psychological aspects. Jungstates, then, that the term \"psychoid\" is \"... meant to distinguish a category of eventsfrom merely vitalistic phenomena on the one hand and from specifically psychicprocesses on the other.\" (Vol. 8, p. 177)Since in order to he influenced by the disposable energy of the will a function orprocess must he capable of becoming conscious, the characteristic quality of thosefunctions that are psychoid is their incapability of reaching full consciousness. Thesense in which Jung sees"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Page 26the instincts as not capable of full consciousness is made clear in the following way:We speak of ''instinctive actions,\" meaning by that a mode of behaviour of which neither the motive northe aim is fully conscious and which is prompted only by obscure inner necessity.... Thus instinctive actionis characterized by an unconsciousness of the psychological motive behind it, in contrast to the strictlyconscious processes which are distinguished by the conscious continuity of their motives. (Vol. 8, p. 130)However, the delineation of the psyche in terms of functions that can become fullyconscious and hence capable of being influenced by the disposable energy of the will isnot completed by distinguishing between the psyche and the instincts. For Jung makesthe point that there is another type of function that limits the will and that cannot bedescribed as instinctual in the physiological sense. This function is called \"spiritual\"and is mediated by those structures Jung calls the \"archetypes.\" This spiritual functionis like instinct a psychoid function incapable of full consciousness. 8A full discussion of what Jung means by the spiritual will be given in chapter 2. Here itwill suffice to state that for Jung the compulsiveness associated with the nonpsychicrealm is due not only to dynamisms of physiological origin, the instincts; but, inaddition to this \"lower\" limit, the psyche has an \"upper\" limit where the psychicfunctions gradually fall under the influence of spiritual determinants. \"Just as, in itslower reaches, the psyche loses itself in the organic-material substrate, so in its upperreaches it resolves itself into a 'spiritual' form about which we know as little as we doabout the functional basis of instinct.\" (Vol. 8, p. 183)But from a phylogenetic point of view, the question now arises why the spiritualfunction is said to be \"higher\" than the instinctual psychoid function, since the psycheappears to have developed out of the psychoid processes considered as a whole and thusto be \"higher\" than it in the sense of having developed later. The solution to this enigmaseems to be that although the archetypal psychoid processes are probably present, atleast in rudimentary form, throughout the animal kingdom, it is only with thedevelopment of the more advanced forms of consciousness that there is a clearseparation between instinctual and spiritual psychoid functions.9 Moreover, it seems tobe just this separation that brings about the phenomenon of consciousness so that \"...psychic processes seem to be balances of energy flowing between spirit and instinct,... \"(Vol. 8, p. 207)In this separation of spiritual and instinctual functions, the instinctual energies seem tobe channeled by the spiritual forms so that in a sense the spiritual function is that whichallows the energies of humankind to be employed in other than instinctual activities.This is the sense in which the spiritual function is higher than the instinctual. From thestandpoint of phylogeny, however, the designation \"higher\" is misleading since both"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Page 27types of psychoid processes are unconscious in relation to the later developingconsciousness associated with the psyche. \"Spirit and instinct are by nature autonomousand both limit in equal measure the applied field of the will.\" (Vol. 8, p. 183) 10UnconsciousNow it would seem that an understanding of the delineation of the psyche in terms ofthe will leads to the conclusion that the psyche is to be conceived as equivalent toconsciousness or awareness in opposition to the psychoid functions, the distinguishingfeature of which is their incapability of full consciousness and hence relative autonomyfrom the will. (Vol. 8, pp. 183-184) However, it is only when we consider the attributionof an unconscious dimension to the psyche that a full characterization of what Jungintends by his psyche construct can be completed.In order to resolve this apparent paradox of the existence of an unconscious psyche,then, it is necessary to focus on the meaning Jung gives to the notion of theunconscious. He says that: \"Since we perceive effects whose origin cannot be found inconsciousness, we are compelled to allow hypothetical contents to the sphere of thenon-conscious, which means presupposing that the origin of those effects lies in theunconscious precisely because it is not conscious.\" (Vol. 4, p. 140) Thus, \"... everythingin the personality that is not contained in the conscious should be found in theunconscious\" (Vol. 3, p. 204)The unconscious understood in this negative way as the nonconscious is relativelyunproblematic. Whatever is not immediately present in awareness is said to beunconscious. Memories, for example, can be said to be unconscious contents that can bebrought into consciousness at will. Other unconscious contents such as repressedexperiences or subliminal perceptions may also be brought into awareness, although aspecial effort or technique is needed. Since the latter are not as easily recoverable toawareness as the former, they are said to belong to a \"deeper level\" of the unconscious.The analogy of depth then amounts operationally to a function of energy. Contents witha certain critical energy stay in consciousness and lacking it become unconscious. Whencontents which are ordinarily unconscious become charged with energy, they intrudethemselves into conscious awareness and produce a so-called lowering of consciousnesswith a consequent disruption of conscious intentionalities.The boundary or dividing point between conscious and unconscious is thus an energythreshold. However, this idea that conscious and unconscious are qualitatively separateshould not be understood to mean that a sort of energy membrane sharply dividesconscious from unconscious contents. For it is rather the case that every psychic content"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"is to some degree unconscious and that consequently the psyche is both conscious"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Page 28and unconscious at once:Consequently there is a consciousness in which unconsciousness predominates, as well as a consciousnessin which self-consciousness predominates. This paradox becomes immediately intelligible when we realizethat there is no conscious content which can with absolute certainty be said to be totally conscious,... (Vol.8, pp. 187-188)We must, however, accustom ourselves to the thought that conscious and unconscious have no cleardemarcations, the one beginning where the other leaves off. It is rather the case that the psyche is aconscious-unconscious whole. (Vol. 8, p. 200)It becomes clear then how the characterization of the psyche in terms of the will allowsfor an unconscious dimension to the psyche. For it is only the possibility of an influenceby the will that is necessary to characterize the psychic as distinct from the psychoid.Moreover, rather than being identical with consciousness, the psyche is even betterconceived as being for the most part unconscious, with the conscious part being ofcomparatively narrow scope. For in addition to those items of immediate awareness,there are other contents on the fringes of consciousness or just below the threshold ofawareness. Jung catalogues these unconscious contents in the following way: \"... lostmemories, painful ideas that are repressed (i.e., forgotten on purpose), subliminalperceptions, by which are meant sense-perceptions that were not strong enough to reachconsciousness, and finally, contents that are not yet ripe for consciousness\"; (Vol. 7, p.66) and, in other words, ... everything forgotten or repressed or otherwise subliminalthat has been acquired by the individual consciously or unconsciously.\" (Vol. 17, p.116)Often these unconscious contents group together to form subliminal functional unitswhich then become sort of \"splinter psyches\" or \"fragmentary personalities.\" (Vol. 8, p.97) These focal points of unconscious psychic activity are designated as the complexes.They are groups of often highly emotionally charged feelings, thoughts, and images thatare associated together so that, for instance, an environmental stimulus which activatesthe complex results in the entirety of the associated psychic contents coming into playand affecting consciousness. This often leads to a response which is out of proportion tothe initiating stimulus. For Jung the ego itself is also a complex, \"the complex ofconsciousness.\" (Vol. 14, p. 357) ''... the complex of the ego may well be set parallelwith and compared to the secondary autonomous complex.\" (Vol. 2, p. 601)Collective UnconsciousWith the description of these unconscious components to the psyche, then, the conceptof the psyche according to Jung's characterization of it in"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Page 29in terms of the will is complete. However, Jung goes on to describe the psychoid regionof the unconscious that is designated as a collective unconscious in contrast to theregion of the unconscious in relatively close association to consciousness which he callsthe \"personal unconscious.\"As to the no man's land which I have called the \"personal unconscious,\" it is fairly easy to prove that itscontents correspond exactly to our definition of the psychic. Butas we define \"psychic\"is there a psychicunconscious that is not a \"fringe of consciousness\" and not personal? (Vol. 8, p. 200)The above quotation should make it clear that although according to Jung's specificationof what the psyche means in the strict sense it should be applied only to consciousnessand the personal unconscious, Jung frequently uses the term to include the collective,impersonal portions of the unconscious as well. Thus, Jung often speaks of a collectivepsyche or of an impersonal, objective psyche- Further discussion on this point of howthe collective unconscious can be said to be psychic on the one hand and not to fit intothe definition of the psyche on the other must wait until further in the exposition (seepages 36-37). The crucial distinction involves discriminating between the psychiccontents as they appear in consciousness and their postulated but unobserveddeterminants which are said to be psychoid rather than psychic. However, for ourpurpose here, it is sufficient to point out that there is for Jung an impersonal andcollective aspect to the unconscious in contrast to the personal unconscious describedabove.This collective unconscious is said, moreover, to constitute a deeper stratum of theunconscious than the personal. Whereas for the personal unconscious the \"depth\" of acontent represents a corresponding lack of energy and hence a greater degree ofnonassociation to the central focus of awareness, the collective unconscious is \"deeper\"in the additional sense of being the foundation of the \"upper\" layers. Consciousness andthe personal unconscious then represent the individual and personal heterogeneitywhich develops through maturation from a common and universal homogeneity:\"Individual consciousness is only the flower and the fruit of a season, sprung from theperennial rhizome beneath the earth;...\" (Vol. 5, p. xxiv)Jung thus uses the term \"collective\" to mean the opposite of personal or individual: \"Ihave chosen the term 'collective' because this part of the unconscious is not individualbut universal; in contrast to the personal psyche, it has contents and modes of behaviourthat are more or less the same everywhere and in all individuals.\" (Vol. 9-A, pp. 3-4)Jung argues that since the body may be said to have certain universal features that forma common basis for the emergence of individual differences, it would then bereasonable to expect that the psyche, which"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Page 30is intimately related to the body, would also have common and universal features:... just as the human body shows a common anatomy over and above all racial differences, so, too, thehuman psyche possesses a common substratum transcending all differences in culture and consciousness.(Vol. 13, p. 11)For just as there is an objective human body and not merely a subjective and personal one, so also there isan objective psyche with its specific structures and activities ... (Vol. 3, p. 267)The idea of a collective unconscious thus understood as the common, universal elementof the psyche would seem relatively unproblematic or perhaps even superfluous as aconcept since no one would wish to deny that the psyche has foundations in thestructure of the brain that are common to all people. However, the real import of Jung'stheory of a collective unconscious is brought into clarity when Jung states that thecontents of the collective unconscious are in fact psychic contents which come intoawareness but which are not the direct consequences of the individual's own personalexperiences: \"... in addition to memories from a long-distant conscious past, completelynew thoughts and creative ideas can also present themselves from theunconsciousthoughts and ideas that have never been conscious before.\" (Man and HisSymbols, p. 25) The collective unconscious is then not only the structural elementcommon to the psyches of all humans; it is also the active source of original psychiccontents.Additional features of Jung's concept of the collective unconscious come to light whenwe learn that...ego-consciousness seems to be dependent on two factors: firstly, on the conditions of the collective, i.e.,the social, consciousness; and secondly, on the arch, or dominants, of the collective unconscious. Thelatter fall phenomenologically into two categories: instinctual and archetypal. (Vol. 8, pp. 217-218)Thus, both instincts as well as archetypes characterize the collective unconscious.Moreover, there is in addition a concept of collective consciousness that is to bedistinguished from the collective unconscious. Jung states that by collectiveconsciousness he has something similar in mind to Freud's idea of the superego. (Vol.9-A, p. 3, note 2) Like the superego, the collective consciousness is partially consciousand partially unconscious. It consists of \"generally accepted truths,\" (Vol. 8, p. 218) thatis, of beliefs, values and ideals that are supposedly held in common by members of acommunity, and that serve as a sort of common ideological basis or cultural ideal forthe community. The recent phenomenon of the so-called counterculture would thenrepresent a process of development"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Page 31or change in the collective consciousness of our time.The collective consciousness has its ultimate source in the collective unconscious. Forthrough the influence of the collective unconscious on individuals, new ideals, ethicaland religious systems, and basic scientific discoveries come into awareness for the firsttime. However, the symbolic quality of these images from the unconscious is eventuallylost as the images and ideas are subjected to the interpretive powers of generations inorder to assimilate them to the existing system of culture. Through this process themanifestation of the collective unconscious in one pioneer individual is graduallytransformed into the cultural heritage and collective consciousness of the community.The result is then often the sort of transition that the religious insight of an individualundergoes in the change from the teachings of the individual in his lifetime to theformation of a doctrine of established belief by his later followers. It is the differencebetween an original religious experience and the dogma of an established church. Thus,Jung states that \"... we can hardly avoid the conclusion that between collectiveconsciousness and the collective unconscious there is an almost unbridgeable gulf overwhich the subject finds himself suspended.\" (Vol. 8, p. 218)Jung makes the point that through the process of socialization and in attempting toadapt to the demands of society we tend to identify ourselves with the consequent rolesthat we must play in order to fit smoothly into the social order. This part of thepersonality Jung calls the \"persona\" The word means mask and like a mask the personais the person that we pretend to be in order to have a well-defined niche in thecommunity.When we analyse the persona we strip oft the mask, and discover that what seemed to be individual is atbottom collective; in other words, that the persona was only a mask of the collective psyche.Fundamentally the persona is nothing real: it is a compromise between individual and society as to what aman should appear to be. (Vol. 7, p. 158)By \"collective psyche\" in this context it is clear that the collective consciousness ismeant. However, there are other passages in which the term \"collective psyche\" meanscollective unconscious. For exampleIt is therefore absolutely essential to make the sharpest sable demarcation between the personal and theimpersonal attributes of the psyche. This is not to deny the sometimes very formidable existence of thecontents of the collective unconscious, but only to stress that, as contents of the collective psyche, they areopposed to and different from the individual psyche. (Vol. 7, p. 94)\"Collective psyche\" is then an ambiguous term leaving still to be specified the amountof unconsciousness that is implied. This formulation is sometimes preferable whenspeaking of the consciousness of a group,"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Page 32particularly when there is a strong group identity. For since the collective consciousnessis grounded in the collective unconscious, there are then correspondences between theinstitutions of culture and the related archetypes. The effectiveness of the communityleader, for example, is often a function of his capacity to fulfill the expectations broughtabout by the projection of the archetype of the hero or Old Wise Man upon him, and theguiding ideals of the community remain cohesive factors for the life of community onlyas long as they remain living symbols capable of constellating the appropriatearchetypal configurations. The ambiguous collective psyche is then sometimes the bestdescription of the Zeitgeist of a people, as it acknowledges the close relationshipbetween the foundations of culture in the collective unconscious and the embodimentsof those foundations in the accepted standards of collective life.Moreover, Jung's use of the ambiguous collective psyche becomes easier to appreciatewhen it is made clear that for him the relationship of the personal psyche to thecollective unconscious is closely analogous to the relationship of the individual tosociety. \"Now, all that I have said here about the influence of society upon theindividual is identically true of the influence of the collective unconscious upon theindividual psyche.\" (Vol. 7, p. 154) Therefore, the psychology of a community is notbasically different from the psychology of an individual: \"... the psyche of a people isonly a somewhat more complex structure than the psyche of an individual.\" (Vol. 10, p.86)Collective consciousness and the collective unconscious may thus both be subsumedunder collective psyche due to the close relationship of the individual to the collectiveaspect in each case. The individual has then both an inner and an outer relationship tothe collective as he must contend with society without and the collective unconsciouswithin.In so far as the similarities rather than the differences between collective consciousnessand collective unconscious are emphasized as in collective psyche, questions then ariseconcerning the existence of distinct kinds of group psyches. That is, to what extent isthe idea of a collective unconscious meant to be truly transcultural and to what extent isthere intended to be a different collective unconscious for each distinct humancommunity?Evidence can be found in Jung's work to support either of the two possible positionssuggested above. For example, we find: \"The collective unconscious is simply thepsychic expression of the identity of brain structure irrespective of all racialdifferences.\" (Vol. 13, p. 11) Also:"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"When I first came across such contents [archetypal images] I wondered very much whether they might notbe due to heredity, and I thought they might be explained by racial inheritance. in order to settle thatquestion I went to the United States and studied the dreams of pure-blooded Negroes, and I was able tosatisfy myself that these images have nothing to do with so-called blood or racial inheritance,... (Vol. 18, p.37)"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Page 33But there are also statements such as the following:No doubt, on an earlier and deeper level of psychic development, where it is still impossible to distinguishbetween an Aryan, Semitic, Hamitic, or Mongolian mentality, all human races have a common collectivepsyche. But with the beginning of racial differentiation essential differences are developed in the collectivepsyche as well. (Vol. 7, p. 152, note 8)Inasmuch as there are differentiations corresponding to race, tribe, and even family, there is also acollective psyche limited to race, tribe, and family over and above the \"universal\" collective psyche. (Vol.7, pp. 147-148)Part of the difficulty of understanding Jung on this point is due to the problematicinteraction of form and contentto the difference between a common universal structureand its concrete embodiment in ways which are characteristic of individual cultures.Moreover, the word \"collective psyche\" tends to obscure these differences which arisefrom the fact that the collective unconscious is an abstraction derived from thephenomena of concrete cultures in which the archetypes exist as actual symbols andimages.However, in light of the totality of Jung's writings, it is not necessary to reconcile thetwo views quoted above, as it is clear that the view that there might be racial, ethnic,and geographic differences in the collective unconscious was one which had beenclearly abandoned by Jung in his later writings after about 1929. 11But although Jung specifically rejects the idea of differences in the collectiveunconscious based on racial inheritance, this is not to say that Jung does not argue forthe existence of distinct differences in the psychology of different ethnic, racial, andgeographic groups. Rather than being the result of racial, ethnic, or geographicdifferences in the collective unconscious itself, however, the differences in thecollective psyche which Jung defends in his latex writings (i.e., after about 1929) aredue to cultural influences. For different groups assimilate the archetypes into distinctcultural forms, and the phenomenological form of the archetypal images are then adirect result of cultural influence (see pages 57-58). Moreover, one archetype may beemphasized in one culture but not in another. Due to the ambiguity of collective psyche,then, Jung can discuss significant differences in the collective psyches of differentgroups due to cultural determinants while still maintaining the essential uniformity ofthe collective unconscious itself.12In addition to the question of racial, ethnic, and geographic differences in the collectiveunconscious, the use of the latter term raises another question which must be consideredat this point. For it is tempting to understand collective unconscious in such a way that asort of group mind is postulated to exist as a superindividual entity. Moreover, from the"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"limited perspective of the individual ego, the collective unconscious is"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Page 34experienced as something outside of and alien to one's personality so that,phenomenologically, it seems as if the collective unconscious exists as an entity in itsown right independently of the individual.At times Jung writes in such a way as to suggest that he believes that whatphenomenologically seems to exist in this regard is actually the case:In our ordinary mind we are in the worlds of time and space and within the separate individual psyche. Inthe state of the archetype we are in the collective psyche, in a world-system whose space-time categoriesare relatively or absolutely abolished. (Letters, Vol. 2, p. 399, letter to Stephen Abrams dated 21 October1957)Accordingly the capacity to nullify space and time must somehow inhere in the psyche, or, to put it anotherway, the psyche does not exist wholly in time and space. it is very probable that only what we callconsciousness is contained in space and time, and that the rest of the psyche, the unconscious, exists in astate of relative spacelessness and timelessness. For the psyche this means a relative eternality and arelative non-separation from other psyches, or a oneness with them. (Letters, Vol. 1, p. 256, letter to PastorFritz Pfäfflin dated 10 January 1939)Hence there is only one collective unconscious, which is everywhere identical with itself, from whicheverything psychic takes shape before it is personalized, modified, assimilated, etc. by external influences.(Letters, Vol. 1, p. 408, letter to Pastor Max Frischknecht dated 8 February 1946)We have already seen how the phenomena of parapsychology and Jung's theory ofsynchronicity based in part on these phenomena lead Jung to conclusions that aredifficult to reconcile with his psychology as a whole. in this instance, Jung seems towant to postulate a collective psyche that is independent of space and time, and whichthus exists relatively independently of individual psyches.However, it would be unfair to Jung to state that he unequivocally asserted such an idea,although he seems to be groping towards the formulation of such a view in his laterwritings. In any case, in line with our program of naturalistic reconstruction, the idea ofthe collective unconscious as a superindividual entity, that is, an entity that exists overand above the psyches of individuals, will not be assumed in the following. 13"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Page 352Theory of Archetypes: Part 1IntroductionPreliminary RemarksOUR discussion of the notion of a collective unconscious serves as an introduction to theconcept of the archetype. For in addition to the instincts, the collective unconscious issaid to contain archetypes. It is the notion of archetypes that gives Jung's collectiveunconscious its real substance, and it is the resolution of questions concerning thearchetypes upon which the real point of a concept of a collective unconscious depends.Many such questions inhabit the fringes of consciousness while reading about thearchetypes: What really is an archetype? What sort of ontological status is it supposedto have? What is the relationship between the archetypes and the instincts? Where dothe archetypes come from? What is the difference between the archetype in itself andthe archetype as it appears in consciousness? What are the chef archetypes? Whatcauses their appearance in consciousness?These many questions about the archetypes reflect the many aspects and perspectivesfrom which the idea can be considered. In order to gain an insight into the unifyingelements of these different perspectives on the archetype, our exposition will proceedwith a conceptual overview followed by a detailed discussion of the different aspects ofthe concept.Characterization of the ArchetypeIt will be remembered from the above discussion of the collective unconscious that thecontents of this portion of the psyche were said to be objective and impersonal in thesense that the collective unconscious is the supposed source of original contents thatappear in consciousness but which seem not to have been conscious before. Forexample, an individual has a dream, vision, or fantasy composed of alien images towhich he has no personal associations. Moreover, parallels to the phenomenon's basicthemes can then be found in materials drawn from comparative symbology which areunknown to the person previous to his experience of the archetypal event."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Page 36The following dream illustrates these characteristic archetypal qualities:In my dream I am at an amusement park with my wife and another couple. The first amusement we decideto see is a sort of \"haunted house.\" To enter we descend a flight of stairs into a cool, damp cellar consistingof an empty main room. Looking into one room I see nothing. At this point a ghostlike figure appears. Irecognize the \"ghost\" as a child dressed in a costume and am friendly to it. The \"ghost\" then leaves. In thenext room, I see a table. Upon the table is a small, incomplete childlike body. A large knife is hovering inthe air over the table and proceeds to dismember the body. Blood gushes out, spurting into the air in greatstreams. I think that this \"show\" is a little too much for an amusement for the general public, although Ipersonally am not affected by the gore. The ''body\" then begins to carry on a normal conversation with mewhile the blood continues to spurt and gush over the table top. The show is then over and the bodydisappears. 1In this particular case, it is the archetypal motif of ritual dismemberment which is the most outstandingfeature of the dream. The dreamer had no idea as to what this image might mean and was unfamiliar withthe frequent occurrence of this theme in the literature of alchemy.2What Jung means by an archetype, then, is a disposition in the collective unconscious to produce such animage in consciousness as the one above. Jung distinguishes between the actual image, which he calls the\"archetypal image,\" and the archetype per se, which, as a disposition of the unconscious, is unobservablein principle.3 However, the term \"archetype\" is frequently used indiscriminately for both the archetypalmanifestation and the archetypal disposition. The archetypal image is then a concrete instantiation of thehypothetical, unobservable archetype per se.Archetypal contents that emerge into awareness assume a form which is a reflection ofthe individual consciousness. This fact that archetypes appear in a personal form seemsto be an instance of the tendency to structure awareness of unfamiliar phenomena sothat they resemble familiar forms of experience.The unconscious supplies as it were the archetypal form, which in itself is empty and irrepresentable.Consciousness immediately fills it with related or similar representational material so that it can beperceived. For this reason archetypal ideas are locally, temporally, and individually conditioned. (Vol. 13,p. 346)In the case of the dismemberment dream, this assimilation of the archetypal motif intoan individual context is illustrated when the uncanny and alien ritual ofdismemberment, concerning which the dreamer had no"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Page 37knowledge, was represented in the familiar setting of an amusement park.Ontological Status of the ArchetypeThe archetype can be said to have the ontological status of a hypothetical construct.Like the electron, the archetype can be detected only through the effects which itproduces, and, as with the electron, this unobservability is not held to make thearchetype any less real than directly perceivable objects like chairs and doorknobs.Unlike the electron, however, the archetypes are unobservable in principle. Since theunconscious can only be known indirectly through its effect on consciousness, there isno possibility of a direct perception of these unconscious contents. Thus, the archetypesper se are only possibilities to form observable phenomena with the determinate form inwhich they appear being the result of the interaction between this disposition in thecollective unconscious and the informing consciousness.In basing the ontology of the archetypes on a position of scientific realism, Jung wantsto carefully distinguish his unobservable theoretical entities from metaphysicalconcepts such as Plato's forms. The difference is that the archetypes are empiricallyderived and grounded. They are the product of Jung's therapeutic work in which hefound it increasingly difficult to fit all of the phenomenological material into anexplanatory framework which included only a personal unconscious. There exists, then,the possibility of falsification to the extent that the archetypal theory fails to provideadequate explanation for the observed phenomena. The relationship between experienceand the postulated concepts of metaphysics, on the other hand, is too vague to allow forthe possibility of disconfirmation in principle.Relationship of Archetypes and InstinctsSince the archetypes are not the product of an individual's personal experience, theymust then be the result of inheritance. Rather than inherited experiences or inheritedimages, however, the archetypes are transmitted as the disposition to form images andideas. There are close parallels here with the instincts, which rather than being inheritedbehaviors are instead inherited dispositions to produce certain behaviors when activatedby the appropriate environmental releasing stimuli. With this similarity to the instinctsin mind, Jung often refers to the archetypes as patterns of behavior.... they prove to be typical attitudes, modes of actionthought-processes and impulses which must beregarded as constituting the instinctive behaviour typical of the human species. The term I chose for this,namely \"archetype,\" therefore coincides with the biological concept of the \"pattern of behaviour.\" (Vol. 3,p. 261)"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Page 38Just as the body develops evolutionarily conditioned modes of responding to externaland internal stimuli, Jung hypothesizes the development of analogous phylogeneticpatterns for the psyche. The archetypes are then somewhat trice psychic instincts.Moreover, since the body is not functionally a separate entity from the mind, these\"mental instincts\" are parallel psychic counterparts to the inherited modes of bodilyresponse. \"... there is good reason for supposing that the archetypes are the unconsciousimages of the instincts themselves,...\" (Vol. 9-A, p. 44)The fact that archetypes can be understood as patterns of behavior emphasizes, then,their biological aspect and their continuity with naturalistically understood processes.With a widening of the traditional use of \"patterns of behaviour,\" this allows for thepossibility of archetypes in animals. \"There is nothing to prevent us from assuming thatcertain archetypes exist even in animals, that they are grounded in the peculiarities ofthe living organism itself...\" (Vol. 7, p. 69)Archetypes as A Priori Conditioning FactorsHowever, the archetypes can also be seen from the cognitive point of view as inherentcategories of apprehension. (Vol. 6, p. 376) This perspective underlines their role as thestructuring elements of the psyche and focuses on those aspects of the archetypes whichseem least directly connected with instincts as ordinarily understood. It may seemdifficult, then, to grasp how the archetypes can be at once both patterns of behavior and\"a priori conditioning factors.\" However, man's characteristic pattern of behavior is todevelop consciousness that can then act at variance with or in relative independence ofthe instincts understood as drives of the body. And, since for Jung, the mind and bodyare not really separate entities but merely different aspects, his shift from thearchetypes as patterns of behavior to talk of archetypes as categories of the psyche canbe seen as a plausible move rather than as a logical leap. \"As a priori conditioningfactors they represent a special, psychological instance of the biological 'pattern ofbehaviour,'...\" (Vol. 11, p. 149, note 2)Now in characterizing the archetypes as a priori conditioning factors, what Jung has inmind is similar to the idea of categories worked out by Kant. 4 Moreover, it sometimesappears as if Jung is attempting to broaden Kant's concept so that in addition tonecessary forms of cognition, the archetypes will also be categories of the imagination.Specifically the archetypes are held to be forms of thought, perception, andimagination. (Vol. 9-A, p. 44) However, the comparison of the archetypes to theKantian categories is only of limited usefulness. For the archetypes can be said to benecessary only in the biological sense of being part of our inheritance that will thennecessarily influence us.

A hominoid on adifferent planet could then conceivably develop different archetypes. 5Moreover, Kant's categories were the necessary formal aspects to which any experiencemust conform, whereas Jung's archetypes are the forms of only certain types ofexperience Thus, the archetypes are more properly described as primordial images thanas categories in Kant's sense. For the archetypes as \"thought-forms,\" (Vol. 7, p. 66) thatis dispositions to form certain typical images and thoughts, come into consciousnessonly under unusual circumstances, rather than being the structuring aspect of experiencein general. This is then what Jung has in mind when he states: \"Only, in the case of our'forms,' we are not dealing with categories of reason but with categories of theimagination.\" (Vol. 11, p. 518)From the point of view of similarity with Kant, the archetypes can be seen to beuniversal, inborn, and formal elements of the psyche. (Vol. 9-A, p. 44) Moreover, theindividual and personal aspects of the psyche are held to develop from a universalsubstratum in the collective unconscious. From this perspective the ego is itself anarchetype in the sense that it is prefigured as an a priori possibility in the collectiveunconscious of the individual before it emerges by a process of differentiation. All ofthe complexes, in fact, although they are predominantly manifestations of the personalunconscious, have a \"nuclear element\" which is composed of an archetype in addition toexperientially derived elements. (Vol. 8, p. 11)... every complex, has or is a (fragmentary) personality. At any rate, that is how it looks from the purelyobservational standpoint. But when we go into the matter more deeply, we find that they are reallyarchetypal formations. (Vol. 5, p. 255)What this archetypal basis of complexes amounts to is that a complex which can betraced to events in the individual's personal history is often \"magically\" complicatedbecause the personal situation has been assimilated to the archetypal one. For example,problems originating from the relationship with the parents are frequently the result ofthe tact that the individual has since childhood seen the parents as gods. The father isperceived as Cod the Father and the mother in terms of the Archetype of the GreatMother or Earth Mother. The troubled individual then cannot successfully distinguishbetween the parents as individuals and the archetypal projections in terms of which heor she has habitually perceived them.For every typical human situation there is a corresponding archetype so that theexperience of the individual in such a situation invariably galls under the influence ofan archetypal pattern. In this respect the description of the archetypes as \"patterns ofinstinctual behaviour\" seems amply justified."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Page 40However, the archetypal notion runs the risk of being overgeneralized into triviality ifthe idea of the archetypes as formal a priori conditioning factors is taken as a guide forexplaining all human behavior. For example, the archetypes can be seen as thephylogenetic forms to which ontogeny supplies the content. But, although thisunderstanding of the archetypes is hypothetically plausible, it is misleading from anoperational point of view. For although in principle all aspects of the personality arefounded on the common structure of the collective unconscious out of whichindividuality emerges like an island out of the ocean, the archetypes cannot beexclusively appealed to in order to form a comprehensive theory of behavior. Thiswould be an incomplete and one-sided perspective ignoring the vitally importantontogenetic factors influencing individual development. in the case of the complexes,for example, Jung identifies them with the personal unconscious. The archetypalnucleus is called upon as an explanatory principle only when the psychological situationseems incomprehensible from an exclusively personal point of view. That there is acommon and universal structure to the psyche is then a true statement, but not alwaysan informative one for all distinct aspects of behavior.Further Implications of Kantian InfluenceOn the basis of the discussion so far, it could be fairly concluded that, on the whole, it ismore accurate to understand the archetypes as patterns of behavior than to think of themin terms of Kant's theory of knowledge. This conclusion, however, would beunwarranted as the full extent of Kant's influence on Jung's idea of the archetypes hasyet to be described.Jung's insistence on the label of empiricism to characterize his work, for example, is aconsequence of his methodological ideal of staying within the bounds of possibleexperience. Moreover, in terms of Jung's thought, the concept of the psyche describesthese bounds. There is no possibility of getting outside the psyche to determine how thepsyche interprets the world for all experience is most immediately and inescapablypsychic experience. The psyche is the mediator of all experience, both from within andwithout. If a thinker comes up with a metaphysical scheme which he thinks grasps theessential nature of reality, Jung then alerts us to the need for a psychological critique.The claims of universal validity which the system-maker has put forth transcendpossible experience and are justified only on the basis of intuition. It is just at this pointthat Jung's theory of archetypes assumes a deflationary role by explaining the appeal ofthe metaphysical system on the basis of its conformity to the fundamental aspects of thethinker himself rather than to conformity of the system with the ultimate nature ofreality:"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"When a speculative philosopher believes he has comprehended the world once and for all in his system, heis deceiving himself; he has merely comprehended himself and then naïvely projected that view upon theworld. (Vol. 3, p. 185)"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Page 41Archetypes and Scientific TheoriesTo complicate matters at this point is the fact that basic scientific insights are held to befounded on archetypes. For example, Robert Mayer's idea of the conservation of energy,(Vol. 7, p. 67) the concept of the atom, (Vol. 9-A, p. 57) and Kekulé's discovery of thestructure of the benzene ring (Man and His Symbols, pp. 25-26) are all understood asillustrating the effect of archetypes....we speak of \"atoms\" today because we have heard, directly or indirectly, of the atomic theory ofDemocritus. But where did Democritus, or whoever first spoke of minimal constitutive elements, hear ofatoms? This notion had its origin in archetypal ideas, that is, in primordial images which were neverreflections of physical events but are spontaneous products of the psychic factor. (Vol. 9-A, p. 57)This archetypal basis of scientific theory is supported when it is shown that the ideashave been present in the history of civilization for many centuries. In Kekulé's case thesolution to his theoretical dilemma came during a state of relaxation when, dozingbefore his fireplace, he seemed to see snakelike atoms dancing in the fire. When one ofthe snakes formed a ring by grasping its own tail, the idea of the benzene ring wasconceived in a flash of insight. 6 This image of a snake (or dragon) biting its own tail iscalled the \"uroboros\" and dates from at least as early as the third century B.C. (Man andHis Symbols, p. 26)Naturally the role of the unconscious must always be seen in proper relation to theactivity of consciousness in these cases. Had Kekulé not already spent great amounts oftime and energy consciously thinking about the problem of the structure of benzene, thesituation of an insightful archetypal constellation could not have occurred. Moreover,there was a great deal of effort necessary after the fireplace episode before the structureof benzene was finally worked out. Notwithstanding the well-documented and criticalrole of the unconscious, then, it should not be thought that scientific theories existpreformed in the collective unconscious.We might well imitate Kant at this point and ask how this apparent conformity betweensymbols from the collective unconscious and scientific theories is possible. Moreover,it needs to be made clear why scientific ideas derived from the archetypes are held to begenuine discoveries and advances, whereas similarly derived metaphysical ideas arerestricted to a sphere of only subjective validity. In the case of science, then, thearchetypal constellation sometimes proves to be instrumental in bringing about aprogressive theoretical advance for science when the image from the unconscious isassimilated in terms of the already existing body of knowledge. Many other ideas fromthe same source are never put to scientific use because they do not happen to becompatible with the progress of science."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Page 42Thus, with scientific theories archetypes are sometimes an important influence withinthe context of discovery. Regardless of the origin of a scientific hypothesis, however, inorder for it to become acceptable to the scientific community, it must be validated interms of criteria of scientific methodology. These criteria of acceptability involverelating the theoretical terms of the hypothesis to observation statements in such a wayas to constitute an empirically derived decision procedure which will indicate whatobservational states of affairs will count for or against the hypothesis. Withmetaphysical theories based on archetypal experience, on the other hand, therelationship between the theory and observations is not specified in such a way as toform the basis for an objective decision procedure which could be used to adjudicateconflicting metaphysical claims.Moreover, the archetypal images are always the partial result of the individual traits ofthe embodying consciousness, with aspects of personal history and cultural backgroundbeing always associated with their appearance. Thus, the personal factor cannot beeliminated in order to arrive at an objectively valid metaphysical statement. in additionto the inevitable contamination of the personal factor, the archetypes can be said to beunavoidably anthropomorphic. As the product of human evolution, they mirrorhumankind and are humankind. Although the archetypes represent humankind'srelationship to the world, it is only from the historically conditioned human standpointreflecting how the universe affects human beings.There is for Jung, nonetheless, a possibility of evaluating the pragmatic value of themetaphysical ideas considered from the standpoint of their ability to further andenhance human existence. Thus, very similar to Nietzsche, Jung would judgemetaphysical ideas on the basis of their life-affirming quality while maintaining thatthe final truth of the ideas in terms of which of them mirror best the ultimate structureof reality could not be decided.In Jung's view we must be careful to distinguish subjective, psychological truth fromobjective truth about the external world; that is, the function of the mythos must bedistinguished from that of the logos. Thus, although it is an error to think of thearchetypes in an objective way in the sense that they represent literally true statementsabout objective states of affairs, yet the archetypes have a psychological validity andare psychologically true in the sense that it is possible to interpret them in asubjectively meaningful way. The validity of the archetypes in terms of applicability tothe human situation must then be acknowledged even in the absence of the possibility ofa scientific validation of statements based on them. For example, the existence of a Godcannot be either proved or disapproved scientifically, yet the existence of an internal"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"God-image or its equivalent must be acknowledged as a psychologically real andeffective event:"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Page 43The gods cannot and must not die. I said just now that there seems to be something, a kind of superiorpower, in the human psyche, and that if this is not the idea of God, then it is the \"belly.\" I wanted toexpress the fact that one or other basic instinct, or complex of ideas, will invariably concentrate upon itselfthe greatest sum of psychic energy and thus force the ego into its service. (Vol. 7, p. 72)The Symbolic Nature of the ArchersThe way in which Jung characterizes the distinctive psychological validity of thearchetypes is by emphasizing the symbolic nature of the archetypal images. Thearchetypes are said to be \"symbolic formulas.\" (Vol. 6, p. 377)The symbol for Jung is to be sharply distinguished from the reference function of signs.Signs are representations of known things. The trademark of a company, for example,simply represents the company itself. Symbols, on the other hand, cannot be said to belogically equivalent to their referents. The symbol points beyond itself to an unknown:Thus a word or an image is symbolic when it implies something more than its obvious and immediatemeaning, it has a wider \"unconscious\" aspect that is never precisely defined or fully explained.... As themind explores the symbol, it is led to ideas that lie beyond the grasp of reason. (Man and His Symbols, p.4)Symbols function as interconnecting links between the conscious and the collectiveunconscious, as they bring into consciousness in representable form the otherwiseunknowable archetypes. The symbols mediate the experience of the archetypes andbecause of the unavoidable personal characteristics due to embodiment in an inindividual consciousness are products of both the collective unconscious andconsciousness.There is then in the symbol a synthesis of known and unknown and of real and unreal:If it were only real, it would not be a symbol, for it would then be a real phenomenon and henceunsymbolic.... And if it were altogether unreal, it would be mere empty imagining, which, being related tonothing real, would not be a symbol either. (vol. 6, p. 111)The symbol ... unites the antithesis between real and unreal, because on the one hand it is a psychic reality(on account of its efficacy), while on the other it corresponds to no physical reality. (Vol. 6, pp. 128-129)To a large extent, then, what we add to the picture of the archetype by calling thearchetypal images \"symbols\" is an emphasis on the living intensity of the archetypes asthey are experienced. The archetypal images are not abstract intellectual concepts, butsymbols which are not transparent to reason and the intellect. Moreover, these symbolshave a"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Page 44certain aura of fascination. They appeal not only to the intellect as puzzles for theunderstanding but to the emotions as well. \"They are as much feelings as thoughts;...\"(Vol. 7, p. 66) This characteristic quality of the symbol to evoke emotion is termed its\"numinosity,\" the numen being the specific energy of the archetypes.With the description of the numinosity of the archetypes, the close relationship betweenarchetypal images and religious motifs becomes evident. For Jung accepts Rudolf Otto'scharacterization of religious experience as a \"careful and scrupulous observation of ...the numinosum,... \"(Vol. 11, p. 7) \"We might say, then, that the term 'religion'designates the attitude peculiar to a consciousness which has been changed byexperience of the numinosum.\" (Vol. 11, p. 8)Although originating through individual experiences of the collective unconscious,religion is, strictly speaking, a phenomenon of collective consciousness. And since notall experiences of the archetypes result in their being assimilated in terms of a religiousframe of reference, another wider designation is needed to characterize the effect of thenuminous quality of archetypes. Thus, the archetypes are said to be \"spiritual\" factors.In a sense spiritual and archetypal are almost equivalent and interchangeable terms. Forwhen we have understood the transpersonal nature of the archetypes, 7 their numinosityand their ability to generate images which serve as the foundations of culture, we havethen made the meaning of the spiritual more definite. What keeps us from asserting thisequivalence of meaning, however, is the instinctual perspective. For the archetypes aresaid to be \"patterns of instinctual behaviour.\" (Vol. 9-A, p. 44) And it is the instinctualaspect of humankind that seems to stand in sharpest contrast to what we wish todesignate as spiritual.However, Jung points to Christian prejudice as the origin of the apparent antithesisbetween spirit and nature:...very remarkable opposition of spirit and nature. Even though spirit is regarded as essentially alive andenlivening, one cannot really feel nature as unspiritual and dead. We must therefore be dealing here withthe (Christian) postulate of a spirit whose life is so vastly superior to the life of nature that in comparisonwith it the latter is no better than death. (Vol. 9-A, p. 210)A more in-depth perspective, then, reveals the paradoxical relation between spirit andinstinct. For they seem to be similar processes of psychic energy that are distinguishedby the application of this energy into diametrically contrasting modes.Moreover, it is in the description of the relation between the spiritual and instinctualthat Jung's psychological viewpoint is in sharpest contrast to that of Freud. For Jungdoes not conceive all psychic energy as being instinctual energy as does Freud. He uses"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"the term for psychic energy,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Page 45libido, in a way that does not imply its equivalence with instinctual energy. There isthen for Jung no need of a concept of sublimation in which instinctual energy must besiphoned off for cultural purposes. Any diversion of the flow of libido from its naturalinstinctual channels in Jung's view leads only to neurotic maladjustment. However,there is more psychic energy available for the human being than is utilized by thenatural instinctual processes. This excess psychic energy can be used for other thaninstinctual purposes, and we might say that this excess energy represents a degree offreedom for humankind to pursue cultural activities for their own sake. The symbolicimages from the collective unconscious then serve as \"transformers\" of energy in thesense that the archetypes represent inherent patterns for this energy flow. (Vol. 5, p.232)Since the spiritual uses of psychic energy are the result of the influence of thearchetypes that are themselves the product of evolution, it becomes evident that thedevelopment of the spirit in humankind is our characteristic pattern of behavior.In reality of course the world-spurning passion of the \"spirit\" is just as natural as the marriage-flight ofinsects. (Vol. 5, p. 396)The spiritual appears in the psyche also as an instinct, indeed as a real passion, a \"consuming fire,\" ... It isnot derived from any other instinct,... but is a principle sui generis, a specific and necessary form ofinstinctual power. (Vol. 8, p. 58)Archetypes and InstinctsIn order to fully understand the meaning of the term \"spiritual,\" a further clarificationof the archetype-insect relation is necessary. For we need to grasp how the spiritual is tobe of the same type of stuff as the instincts and yet seemingly different from and evenopposed to them.A look at animals other than human beings helps to gain an insight into what Jung hasin mind in this regard. For in the examples of patterns of behavior in animals, we seeclearly the unity which in humankind becomes a tension of opposites between spirit andinstinct.A key word \"pattern\" is then the link that enables us to connect the behavior of animalswith the archetypes and instincts in humankind. For the instinctual behavior of animalsis not to be understood as just a blind impulsion to action. Rather, for each instinctualact there is present a total pattern that includes a sort of image of the instinctualsituation:There are, in fact, no amorphous instincts, as every instinct bears in itself the pattern of its situation.Always it fulfils an image, and the image has fixed qualities. The instinct of the leaf-cutting ant fulfils the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"image of ant, tree, leaf, cutting, transport, and the little ant-garden of fungi. If any one of these conditionsis lacking, the instinct does not function, because it cannot exist without its total pattern, without its image.Such an image is"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Page 46an a priori type. It is inborn in the ant prior to any activity, for there can be no activity at all unless aninstinct of corresponding pattern initiates and makes it possible. (Vol. 8, p. 201)The instinctual acts of animals then seem to be unified by a pattern that includes a sortof intuitive recognition of the goal of the instinctual acts as well as the physiologicalmechanisms which supply the necessary energy.Of course, in the case of animals, our use of ''image\" must be metaphorical; but it isJung's point that this regulating principle of the instinct, the factor which especially inthe insects makes the operation of instinctual behavior amazingly precise and selectiverather than haphazard, can be recognized.The organizing factor of the instinct together with its specific energy make up a unifiedpattern of behavior for animals. In humans, on the other hand, the representations ofthis formal factor of instinct can come into awareness as actual images. Thus, whereasin animals the archetypes and the instincts exist in a fused, undifferentiated state; inhumankind, with the formation of consciousness, they become separable and distinct.In the human realm, then, the archetypes become the forms that regulate the instincts.Moreover, the archetypal images are said to represent the meaning of the instincts andto be \"the unconscious images of the instincts themselves.\" (Vol. 9-A, p. 44) Thearchetypes thus act as guiding factors for the release of instinctual energy in appropriateways characteristic of humankind as a species.But what are these human instincts? Jung recognizes five types of instinctual factors forpeople: \"hunger, sexuality, activity, reflection, and creativity.\" (Vol. 8, p. 118) Heconceded that any attempt to enumerate the human instincts is at least a matter ofcontroversy. The principal reason for this confusion as to what constitutes an instinct ina person is the complication of the psychological factor. For the criterion of what tocount as psychic is the ability of the functioning of the will to modify the otherwiseautomatic and compulsive instincts. it would seem evident, then, that the reason wecannot decide on what to count as purely instinctual in a person is due to the fact thatinstincts are always in part influenced by the psyche. Thus, Jung says that the instinctsper se are ectopsychic and serve the function only of a stimulus, whereas thedetermining factor for human behavior is always the result of an interaction between theectopsychic instinct and the psychic situation of the moment. (Vol. 8, p. 115)This mutual interaction between psyche and instinct in human beings has the result ofmaking the instinctual element ambiguous. For, on the one hand, all psychic processesseem to be founded on an instinctual base; whereas, on the other hand, psychicprocesses also influence the working of the instincts. \"...the instincts are a condition of"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"psychic activity, while at the same time psychic processes seem to condition theinstincts.\" (Vol. 11, p. 330)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Page 47Thus, the twofold nature of instinct becomes more evident in human behavior where foreach instinctual action we have to take into account both the aspect of \"dynamism andcompulsion\" as well as that of \"specific meaning and intention.\" (Vol. 10, p. 287) Foreach instinctual action, then, we can pose the question as to its meaning.Moreover, it is just the archetypal images that are the psychic factors which provide themeaning for the instincts. They are thus the necessary forms of instinctual behavior forhumankind, and it is by an understanding of the process of \"psychization,\" theassimilation of the physiological stimulus to a preexistent psychic pattern that the senseof saying that something represents the meaning of an instinct for humankind is madeclear. (Vol. 8, p. 115)On the other hand, in the animals that have only a rudimentary psyche, there isnevertheless present a unified pattern of behavior as the instinctual acts are the ways inwhich the animal realizes its inherent nature, its possibilities of becoming what it canbe. The appropriate fulfillment of the instinctual nature of an animal is then its way ofrealizing its meaning. If we say that the archetypes in humankind are the images of theinstincts and represent their meaning, we are thus emphasizing this continuity with thelower animals. Humans also have their characteristic patterns of behavior, and thearchetypes act as the patterning factors for these human instincts. Will the fulfillmentof the instincts in human beings then also lead to an unfoldment of their inherent humannature? The answer to this question must of course deal with the factor of the psyche.What is only dimly prefigured in animals becomes in humans with the growth ofconsciousness their particularly human way of being. For a human being to realize itsnature then implies the development of consciousness. This development is like aninstinct in the sense that it comes into being conditioned by the archetypal patterns.However, its nature is to exist as a factor that can operate as a will and hence controland regulate the \"other\" instincts. The nature of consciousness contains then thepossibility of being able to act against nature:It is recognized that man living in the state of nature is in no sense merely \"natural\" like an animal, butsees, believes, fears, worships things whose meaning is not at all discoverable from the conditions of hisnatural environment. Their underlying meaning leads us in fact far away from all that is natural, obvious,and easily intelligible, and quite often contrasts most sharply with the natural instincts. We have only tothink of all those gruesome rites and customs against which every natural feeling rises in revolt, or of allthose beliefs and ideas which stand in insuperable contradiction to the evidence of the facts. All this drivesus to the assumption that the spiritual principle (whatever that may be) asserts itself against the merelynatural conditions with incredible strength. One can say that this too is \"natural,\" and that both have theirorigin in one and the same ''nature.\" I do not in the least doubt this origin, but must point out that this\"natural\" something consists of a conflict between two"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Page 48principles, to which you can give this or that name according to taste, and that this opposition is theexpression, and perhaps also the basis, of the tension we call psychic energy. (Vol. 8, p. 52)That the archetypes seem to enter the human picture on two levelsas patterns ofinstinctual behavior and as spiritual factorsis due to the fact that one of the innatehuman patterns, the tendency to develop consciousness, can act against the other lowerdrives and become a channel of psychic energy in its own right independently of theinstincts. Therefore the archetypes seem to have two paradoxically opposite qualities:\"... the archetype is partly a spiritual factor, and partly like a hidden meaning immanentin the instincts,... \" (Vol. 8, p. 222) Only in human beings, then, is there this potentialsplit between the natural tendencies and the realization of the species-most potentialityof being. This split, which is strictly analogous to that between the conscious andunconscious, is a state of necessary tension since the development of awareness and thegiving in to the unconsciousness of instinctual motivations tend to work against eachother and to a large extent are mutually exclusive activities. However, Jung'spsychological viewpoint as a whole can be understood as the attempt to show how thisnecessary tension between conscious and unconscious and between spirit and instinctneed not necessarily be a conflict. For the integrated personality is one that learns tolive with a balance between these forces of tension rather than excluding one for thesake of the other.But if we can reconcile ourselves to the mysterious truth that the spirit is the life of the body seen fromwithin, and the body the outward manifestation of the life of the spiritthe two being really onethen we canunderstand why the striving to transcend the present level of consciousness through acceptance of theunconscious must give the body its due, and why recognition of the body cannot tolerate a philosophy thatdenies it in the name of the spirit.

Where do the archetypes come from? One wayof approaching this problem is to consider the relationship between archetypes andmythological motifs. For myths and fairytales are one of the most characteristic ways inwhich the archetypes manifest themselves, and the mythological motifs (mythologems)are paradigm archetypal images. if we can discover how myths originate, perhaps thiswill then shed light on the question of the origin of the archetypes. 1In designating mythological motifs as typical archetypal images, the previousdiscussion in chapter 2 may be recalled where we discussed the characteristic symbolicnature of the archetypal images and their religious or spiritual significance. Themythological feature of archetypal manifestation can be seen as consistent with thisprevious discussion in that the myth (in contrast to the mythologem) is a culturalproduct and a phenomenon of the collective consciousness. The myth, then, is the endproduct of a conscious elaboration of an original unconscious content that ofteninvolves the efforts of many generations of storytellers. Thus, the numinous quality ofthe mythologem, the immediate impact of the living intensity of the unconsciousrevelation, is lessened in the process of assimilation of the mythologem to mythicexpression.When Jung states that the religious expression of the archetypes is more numinous thanthat of myths: \"The so-called religious statement is still numinous, a quality which themyth has already lost to a great extent,\" (Vol. 11, p. 301) it would seem that adistinction between mythic and religious expression of archetypes in terms ofnuminosity was intended. But the religious expression of the archetypes can also sufferthe same fate as myths and cease to become \"living\" symbols. Moreover, there areexamples from primitive cultures where the mythological and religious coincide: \"Atribe's mythology is its living religion,... \" (Vol. 9-A, p. 154) Attempting to distinguishbetween mythic and religious expressions of"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Page 50archetypes in terms of numinosity also raises the awkward question of the point atwhich a religious expression of the archetypes would cease to be religious and becomemythological.However, a comparison of passages of Jung's work employing the two terms revealsthat Jung is not particularly concerned with establishing strict criteria of usage whichwould keep them distinct. For example:... esoteric teaching. This last is a typical means of expression for the transmission of collective contentsoriginally derived from the unconscious.Another well-known expression of the archetypes is myth and fairytale. (Vol. 9-A, p. s)...myths of a religious nature can be interpreted as a sort of mental therapy for the sufferings and anxietiesof mankind in general ... (Man and His Symbols, p. 68)I was driven to ask myself in all seriousness: \"What is the myth you are living?\" ... So, in the most naturalway, I took it upon myself to get to know \"my\" myth, and I regarded this as the task of tasks, forso I toldmyselfhow could I, when treating my patients, make due allowance for the personal factor, for my personalequation, which is yet so necessary for a knowledge of the other person, if I was unconscious of it? Isimply had to know what unconscious or preconscious myth was forming me, from what rhizome I sprang.(Vol. 5, pp. xxiv-xxv)In speaking about his personal myth as in the above, it is evident that myths are oftenused as vehicles of the most symbolic and numinous manifestations of the unconscious.Thus, Jung's use of the term \"myth\" deviates somewhat from the ordinary usage.Sometimes he means myth to refer to the symbolic archetypal images themselves, themythologems, and at other times he uses myth in the conventional way to indicate thecultural product as an aspect of the collective consciousness. When this dual sense ofmyth is taken into account, it would seem clear that Jung means that the originalsymbolic expression of archetypes may be either mythic or religious (spiritual) in form.2In attributing a positive function to myths even in the case of modern humans, it isevident that Jung does not see myths as a sort of primitive inferior science, or simply asa crude form of prescientific explanation. This is because of the symbolic nature ofmyths. For if we understand that mythological statements are not really about theexternal physical world but are actually psychological statements, then we are less aptto criticize the myths for their variance with current scientific knowledge. Thus, mythshave a psychological validity and accurately depict the nature of the human situation.The inability of primitives and other unsophisticated individuals to adequatelydistinguish the subjective and objective frequently leads, then, to the phenomenon ofprojection in which an unconscious content is"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Page 51perceived as belonging to an object and as being a property of the object. Through theagency of projection, natural phenomena take on qualities stemming from the collectiveunconscious so that \"... the whole of mythology could be taken as a sort of projection ofthe collective unconscious.\" (Vol. 8, p. 152)In spite of this confusion about inner and outer observed in mythological thinking, Jungasserts that mythology should not be understood as an attempt to formulate a type ofscientific explanation in which the mythos is made to sere as a substitute for the logos:There can be no doubt that science and philosophy have grown from this matrix, but that primitives thinkup such things merely from a need for explanation, as a sort of physical theory, seems to me highlyimprobable. (Vol. 8, p. 153)It would seem rather that the anthropomorphism seen in mythology, the projection ofhuman qualities onto natural phenomena, is an attempt to grasp the meaning of naturein human terms. It is, then, the symbolic meaning of natural phenomena that capturesthe interest of the mythmakers. If we look at alchemy, for example, only as a sort ofprotochemistry, this cannot explain how the interest in it continued in spite of thefailure to produce the desired objective results over periods of hundreds of years. 3 Thealchemist is, of course, taken in to an extent by his own projections; but Jung points outthat the hubris of assuming that our scientific world-view is thus superior to onefounded on mythological projections is not justified, since if the unsophisticated mindanthropomorphizes the world, we have in the present era \"mechanicomorphized\"4 itwith the result that the symbolic quality of our existence is impoverished. We must thenavoid the mistake of trying to see mythology wholly as an attempt at explanation inobjective terms when its explanations are symbolic in nature.Origin of Myths in the PsycheOnce we fully grasp the symbolic function of myth, it is clear that the expression of thearchetypal psyche by means of mythic images cannot be a straightforward mirroring ofnatural events. Yet in some way mythological images seem to arise as the psyche'sprimordial response to physical phenomena. It is clear, however, that the relationshipbetween the physical process and images of mythological motifs is not understood byJung as being one of simple representation. When he says then that the archetypalimage is not to be understood as an allegory of the physical process, he means that theobjective content of representation is experienced symbolically and hence takes onpsychic aspects due to projection:"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Page 52It is not the world as we know it that speaks out of his unconscious, but the unknown world of the psyche,of which we know that it mirrors our empirical world only in part, and that, for the other part, it moulds thisempirical world in accordance with its own psychic assumptions. The archetype does not proceed fromphysical facts, but describes how the psyche experiences the physical fact, and in so doing the psycheoften behaves so autocratically that it denies tangible reality or makes statements that fly in the face of it.(Vol. 9-A, p. 154)Thus, original archetypal (mythological) images are postulated as being the resultant ofan interaction between a physical event and the primitive psyche, with the physicalprocess being interpreted in terms of a psychic fantasy content. Moreover, it is thesubjective part, the fantasies that arise concomitant with the physical process, that arethe formative elements for the mythological motif:What we can safely say about mythical images is that the physical process imprinted itself on the psyche inthis fantastic, distorted form and was preserved there, so that the unconscious still reproduces similarimages today. (Vol. 8, p. 153)It is not storms, not thunder and lightning, not rain and cloud that remain as images in the psyche, but thefantasies caused by the affects they arouse. (Vol. 8, pp. 154-155)Still to be explained, however, is the process of psychic imprinting through which anoriginal mythological image becomes an enduring aspect of the collective unconsciousthat can then produce images of similar form even to the present day. When we readJung on this point, there seems to be an evident appeal to a theory involving inheritanceof acquired characteristics. For although Jung is careful to make clear that it is thedisposition to form images rather than the images themselves that are inherited, yet thisinherited disposition is held to be a sort of condensation of the repeated experiencesresulting from typical human situations:These archetypes, whose innermost nature is inaccessible to experience, are the precipitate of the psychicfunctioning of the whole ancestral line; the accumulated experiences of organic life in general, a milliontimes repeated, and condensed into types. In these archetypes, therefore, all experiences are representedwhich have happened on this planet since primeval times. (Vol. 6, p. 400)The repetition of these typical human experiences leaves a sort of function trace in thepsyche which then can act to produce analogous mythological images in succeedinggenerations. Thus, the archetypes are described as \"mnemic deposits\":From the scientific, causal standpoint the primordial image can be conceived as a mnemic deposit, animprint or engram (Semon), which"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Page 53has arisen through the condensation of countless processes of a similar kind. In this respect it is aprecipitate and, therefore, a typical basic form, of certain ever-recurring psychic experiences. (Vol. 6, pp.443-444)This reference to the influence of Richard Semon seems to clarify what Jung had inmind as a mechanism by which archetypes might be inherited. For the exposition ofSemon's theory in his book The Mneme reveals a sort of theory of racial memory thattries to integrate the factors of memory, habit, and inheritance under one theoreticalprinciple and which appeals explicitly to the idea of the inheritance of acquiredcharacteristics. 5 For example:...the engraphic effects of stimulation are not restricted to the irritable substance of the individual, but thatthe offspring of that individual may manifest corresponding engraphic modifications.6However, Jung's mention of Semon and use of his terminology does not constitute acomplete endorsement of his theory. In particular, Jung is sensitive to the chicken andegg dilemma in relation to the question of the origin of the archetypes. For thearchetypes can not only be seen as the product of past experiences but also asthemselves conditioners of experience. Instead of seeking an explanation of where thearchetypes come from by saying that they are the result of the influence of physicalprocesses on the psyche, then, there is the alternative of conceiving the archetypes aspart of the inherent nature of the psyche itself:The fact that the sun or the moon or the meteorological processes appear, at the very least, in allegorizedform points to an independent collaboration of the psyche, which in that case cannot be merely a productor stereotype of environmental conditions. From whence would it draw the capacity to adopt a standpointoutside sense perception?... in view of such questions Semon's naturalistic and causalistic engram theoryno longer suffices. We are forced to assume that the given structure of the brain does not owe its peculiarnature merely to the influence of surrounding conditions, but also and just as much to the peculiar andautonomous quality of living matter, i.e., to a law inherent in life itself. (Vol. 6, p. 444)Later View on Origin of ArchetypesJung in the course of his work abandoned Semon's theory of engrams and talk ofmnemic deposits disappears from his latex writings. Archetypes were then simply saidto be part of the inherited brain structure, thus leaving the mechanism of hereditarytransmission unspecified. \"Archetypes are systems of readiness for action, and at thesame time images and emotions. They are inherited with the brain-structureindeed, theyare its psychic aspect.\" (Vol. 10, p. 31)With Jung's retreat from the position that archetypes are \"deposits of"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"Page 54the constantly repeated experiences of humanity,\" (Vol. 7, p. 69) we see that thecorrelations he had previously drawn relating physical phenomena to the formation ofmythological images must also be reconsidered. 7 With the abandonment of the engramtheory, Jung is no longer certain he can reconstruct the process by which the objectivephysical event and the interpretive psyche interact to form myths. He seems, on thewhole, in his later work (as exemplified in the quotations immediately below) to havecome to the conclusion that mythological motifs are not amenable to a straightforwardnaturalistic explanation, as if they were caused by physical events.Thus, the question of how archetypes (mythologems) originate is now seen by Jung asno longer a legitimate question since it implies the need for a special explanation ofhow the archetypes came to be in the psyche, whereas Jung now sees the archetypes asdeveloping along with the psyche as part of its inherent pattern of functioning.Empirically considered, however, the archetype did not ever come into existence as a phenomenon oforganic life, but entered into the picture with life itself. (Vol. 11, p. 149, note 2)These images are \"primordial\" images in so far as they are peculiar to whole species, and if they ever\"originated\" their origin must have coincided at least with the beginning of the species. They are the\"human quality\" of the human being, the specifically human form his activities take. This specific form ishereditary and is already present in the gremplasm. (Vol. 9-A, p. 78)The hope expressed earlier, then, that Jung's ideas on the way in which myths originatewould prove to be the clue to solving the fiddle of the origin of the archetypes proves tobe unjustified, and we are left without a definitive answer to the question of how thearchetypes originate. Jung is naturally quite happy to abandon questions of ultimateorigin to the sphere of metaphysics: \"Whether this psychic structure and its elements,the archetypes, ever 'originated' at all is a metaphysical question and thereforeunanswerable\"; (Vol. 9-A, p. 101) and \"... it is impossible to say where the archetypecomes from, because there is no Archimedean point outside the a priori conditions itrepresents.\" (Vol. 9-A, p. 69, note 27)It is evident that, by saying in effect that the question of the origin of the archetypes isnot a useful one to ask, Jung is attempting to avoid the stigma of the doctrine ofinheritance of acquired characteristics with which he had become implicated during hisflirtation with Semon's engram theory. For from the Lamarckian point of view, it makessense to ask how the archetypes come to be in the psyche and to postulate possibleenvironmental causative conditions. With his withdrawal from implicit support of theLamarckian position, Jung sees no point in raising the question.However, asking about the origin of archetypes need not imply a Lamarckian answer.One might legitimately wish to know whether archetypes"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Page 55have a natural, biological origin or nonnatural origin as the result of the intervention ofspiritual agencies.The question is nothing less than this: Does the psychic in generalthe soul or spirit or theunconsciousoriginate in us, or is the psyche, in the early stages of conscious evolution, actually outside usin the form of arbitrary powers with intentions of their own, and does it gradually take its place within us inthe course of psychic development?...This whole idea strikes us as dangerously paradoxical, but, at bottom, it is not altogether inconceivable.(Vol. 10, pp. 69-70)In line with our program of naturalistic reconstruction, we will set aside the possibilityof a spiritual origin of archetypes that Jung's philosophical neutrality on this allows.Disregarding the possibility of a nonnatural origin of archetypes, then, a natural originof archetypes would seem to call for the archetypes coming into being through the sameevolutionary processes as shape the rest of the organism. 8Archetypal Image and Archetype Per SeFunction of the DistinctionAnother difficult challenge for understanding in the archetypal theory is thesignificance of the distinction Jung draws between the archetype per se and thearchetypal image. The archetype per se was said to be not truly part of the psyche at allbut rather psychoid and to be incapable of consciousness. As a consequence, it inprinciple cannot be directly observed. The essential question in this regard would seemto be how such claims as the above can be justified from the empirical point of view.But that nothing is principle would count as a direct observation of an archetype is aresult of the total conceptual framework of the archetypal theory, which as a whole isgrounded empirically. With regard to its empirical basis, then, the archetypal theory isnot significantly different from other scientific theories. Moreover, if, from thephenomenological point of view, the suggestion is made to do away with thehypothetical construct of the archetype per se and instead speak only of archetypalimages, the reply is that this move would mean that a theory of archetypes, as it isconceived in this study, is no longer possible.9 For there must be postulated anunderlying common collective aspect to the psyches of individuals that will make thearchetypal manifestations more than personalistic and idiosyncratic products. Whatcounts as evidentially conclusive for the presence of archetypes is just the appearanceof contents that prove to constitute universal themes or motifs which can be recognizedIn contexts that transcend the individual's personal sphere of reference. Unless thearchetypes are to be reduced to the merely personal, then, there must be postulated an"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"archetype per se that will be the"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Page 56transpersonal organizing principle for the personally and culturally determinedarchetypal manifestation.Individuation of the ArchetypesHowever, in emphasizing the necessity of maintaining the archetype per se as anecessary hypothetical construct in terms of which the phenomenology of thearchetypal images can be understood, it should not then be thought that the archetypescan be easily individuated, so that, for example, an unproblematic list of the archetypescould be agreed on. For Jung emphasizes that the phenomenological material does notjustify definitive conclusions about the nature of the archetype per se: 10When one carefully considers this accumulation of data, it begins to seem probable that an archetype in itsquiescent, unprojected state has no exactly determinable form but is in itself an indefinite structure whichcan assume definite forms only in projection. (Vol. 9-A, p. 70)Thus, the number of archetypes and the point of differentiation between one archetypeand another is indeterminate:Empirically speaking, we are dealing all the time with \"types,\" definite forms that can be named anddistinguished. But as soon as you divest these types of the phenomenology presented by the case material,and try to examine them in relation to other archetypal forms, they branch out into such far-reachingramifications in the history of symbols that one comes to the conclusion that the basic psychic elements areinfinitely varied and ever changing, so as utterly to defy our powers of imagination. (Vol. 9-A, p. 70)Although he [the investigator] is forced, for epistemological reasons, to postulate an indefinite number ofdistinct and separate archetypes, yet he is constantly overcome by doubt as to how far they are reallydistinguishable from one another. They overlap to such a degree and have such a capacity for combinationthat all attempts to isolate them conceptually must appear hopeless. (vol. 11, p. 288)Ira Progoft suggests that the use of the word archetype as a noun is misleading. \"... inthe final analysis it is incorrect to speak of archetypes as nouns, if we are implying bythat that each has a specific and individual existence.\"11Archetype Per Se as Hypothetical ConstructIn considering the problem of the nature of the archetype per se, Kant's influence onJung's views must again be acknowledged. For Jung accepts the Kantian distinctionbetween the thing-in-itself and that which appears. In these terms, then, the archetypeper se is held to be inaccessible on analogy with Kant's noumenon, whereas thearchetypal image is that which appears in the phenomenal realm:12"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Page 57...the archetype per se, its psychoid essence, cannot be comprehended, that it possesses a transcendencewhich it shares with the unknown substance of the psyche in general. (Vol. 10, p. 453)When I say ''atom\" I am talking of the model made of it; when I say \"archetype\" I am talking of ideascorresponding to it, but never of the thing-in-itself, which in both cases is a transcendental mystery....One must therefore assume that the effective archetypal ideas, including our model of the archetype, reston something actual even though unknowable, just as the model of the atom rests on certain unknowablequalities of matter. (Letters, Vol. 2, p. 54, letter to H. Haberlandt dated 23 April 1952)However, it is unnecessary to follow Jung's Kantian way of construing the archetype perse. For rather than implicating the archetypal theory with a problematicphenomena/noumena distinction, we can interpret the archetype per se as anunobservable, hypothetical construct. Thus, although Jung holds that the archetype perse is an ultimate mystery, the archetypal theory only requires that it be the unobservableand mostly unknown structuring principle responsible for the archetypal image.Phenomenological Characteristics of the Archetypal ImagesIn any case, our efforts to discover the nature of the archetype directly are frustratedsince the archetypal image always reflects the personal history of the consciousness inwhich it is embodied. Thus, when we attempt to abstract the archetype itself from itspersonal and cultural matrix, the result is that the distinctiveness of the archetypevanishes, and we can no longer say what it would be like in itself. But if the archetype isthen essentially an \"irrepresentable form,\" the question becomes how we are todistinguish collective archetypal manifestations from merely personal contents ofconsciousness. It would seem that there must be definite phenomenological differencesbetween the archetypal images and other contents if we are to be justified in speaking ofthe existence of a collective unconscious containing archetypes. For in the absence ofany common features that the individual archetypes manifest in every person, we musthave general criteria for recognizing what constitutes an archetypal content.As previously mentioned in the example of an archetypal dream (page 36), archetypalimages characteristically have an alien, impersonal character so that they do not appearto be contents that were once conscious and then were forgotten or repressed. But thisdoes not mean that the contents attributed to the collective unconscious contain imagesthat the dreamer cannot recognize at all. Rather it seems that the strange and aliencontents amount to fantastic rearrangements of items of experience already known tothe dreamer. If one dreams of God, for example, the image may be conveyed as that ofthe figure of Superman. The archetypal images are for the most part, then, somethingfamiliar"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Page 58appearing in an unfamiliar context. Thus, mythological motifs may appear in dreamsbut with modern substitutes for the principal characters:We have only to disregard the dependence of dream language on environment and substitute \"eagle\" for\"aeroplane,\" \"dragon\" for ''automobile\" or \"train,\" \"snake-bite\" for \"injection,\" and so forth, in order toarrive at the rare universal and more fundamental language of mythology. (Vol. 11, p. 289)It would be perhaps advantageous to distinguish the objective from the subjectiveaspects of the phenomenology of archetypes. Subjectively the archetypal appearance ischaracterized by its symbolic qualities. It has an aura of numinosity and seems to pointbeyond itself to an unknown. From the third person point of view, however, thesymbolic nature of the archetypes is less evident as we have to do only with a content ofconsciousness whose origin is unknown, so that what may appear objectively to be asymbol may upon closer examination prove to be a sign with a simple representationalexplanation.In order to verify the presence of an archetype, then, both the views of introspection andextraspection are necessary. 13 The symbolic nature of the person's experience and hisfor the most part absence of personal association to the material is taken into accountalong with the presence of the same theme or motif in material drawn from the historyof symbols. The ability of these historical parallels to provide an explanation of themeaning of the otherwise unexplicable content is then the crucial factor justifying theemployment of the archetypal hypothesis. When such a procedure provides the mostplausible explanation for the presence of contents of consciousness, we can say that anarchetype is present.Rather than taking one particular image or dream in isolation, however, thedetermination of which contents are said to be archetypal is best arrived at with anexamination of a series of dreams or other similar experiences. In this way the marginof error involved in any introspective evaluation is lessened. Then we are also able tosee how the alleged archetype functions is more than one context. From the objectivepoint of view, it is not so much how the supposed archetype appears as what it does andhow it functions that is crucial for deciding about the presence of archetypes. This isespecially so since the archetypes often appear as images that are themselves ordinary,although the role they play in the dream as a whole is archetypal. For example, theimages of actual persons known to the dreamer may function as archetypal images.14Although there is thus no definite objective criteria by which one can identifyarchetypal images out of the context of the function they play in particularmanifestations, Jung does gives us an idea of the objective features that, as a matter offact, are associated with the appearance of many archetypes:"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"Page 59An infallible sign of collective images seems to be the appearance of the \"cosmic\" element, i.e., the imagesin the dream or fantasy are connected with cosmic qualities, such as temporal and spatial infinity,enormous speed and extension of movement, \"astrological\" associations, telluric, lunar, and solaranalogies, changes in the proportions of the body, etc. The obvious occurrence of mythological andreligious motifs in a dream also points to the activity of the collective unconscious. The collective elementis very often announced by peculiar symptoms, as for example by dreams where dreamer is flying throughspace like a comet, or feels that he is the earth, or the sun, or a star, or else is of immense size, ordwarfishly small; or that he is dead, is in a strange place, is a stranger to himself, confused, mad, etc. (Vol7, p. 160)On the whole, the fantastic nature of the archetypal imagery often bears an alarmingsimilarity to or even identity with the symptoms of schizophrenia. But schizophrenics,although they have gained an access to the collective unconscious, has been,figuratively speaking, swallowed up by it so that they have lost the ability to function asan ego and relate in a practical way to the objective world. In a sense they are unable towake from their symbolic fantasies, so that these are more symptoms of psychicbreakdown than they are numinous symbols that can be meaningfully integrated into thetotal pattern of their life.The difference between archetypes and the dissociated products of schizophrenia is that the former areentities with personality and charged with meaning, whereas the latter are only fragments with vestiges ofmeaningin reality, they are products of disintegration. (Vol. 8, p. 122)The phenomenology of the archetypal manifestation is often of immediate therapeuticrelevance as the contents of the unconscious take on dark and menacing aspects whenthe point of view that they represent is not being acknowledged by the conscious mind.The guise in which these figures appear depends on the attitude of the conscious mind: if it is negativetowards the unconscious, the animals will be frightening, if positive, they appear as the \"helpful animals\"of fairytale and legend. (Vol. 5, p. 181)Collective Compensation of Archetypal ImagesIf the form in which the archetypes appear is thus influenced by the attitude of theconscious mind, it would seem that the manifestation of the archetypes are not randomand due to chance, but that their appearance is conditioned by certain necessarycircumstances in the individual. Moreover, an understanding of these conditions shouldshed light on the nature of the relationship between the collective and personal aspectsof the psyche. For by calling the collective unconscious the impersonal and"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Page 60objective portion of the psyche, the integral part this aspect of the unconscious plays inthe life of the individual is not given adequate consideration. In this regard we find,then, that the archetypes behave in an analogous fashion to other contents of theunconscious in the sense that their appearance functions in a compensatory fashion toconsciousness. That is, the unconscious supplies contents that compensate the consciousattitude by representing features of the person's total situation which are overlooked,repressed, or undervalued by the conscious personality. The appearance of the archetypethus usually indicates the need for a collective compensation. What this means is thatthe true nature of the person's situation corresponds to a universal and typical humanpattern, so that what it is that is missing from the person's conscious attitude is anunderstanding of the broader human perspective that an appreciation of the basicpatterns of human existence would give.The archetypal structure of the unconscious corresponds to the average run of events. The changes thatmay befall a man are not infinitely variable; they are variations of certain typical occurrences which arelimited in number. When therefore a distressing situation arises, the corresponding archetype will beconstellated in the unconscious. (Vol. 5, p. 294)One instructive example to make clearer the meaning of collective compensation can bedrawn from Jung's work on the UFO phenomenon. After extensive research lasting adecade, Jung concluded that the UFO phenomenon represented a sort of modem myth inwhich the archetype of the Self, an archetype expressing \"order, deliverance, salvation,and wholeness,\" (Vol. 10, p. 328) was being projected into the heavens. Although unableto reach a definite conclusion about the physical reality of the reported objects, Jungmakes a convincing case for the activation of the Self archetype as a compensation forthe ominous world situation following World War II in which nuclear annihilationseemed possible at any moment.We have here a golden opportunity of seeing how a legend is formed, and how in a difficult and dark timefor humanity a miraculous tale grows up of an attempted intervention by extra-terrestrial \"heavenly\"powers... (Vol. 10, pp. 322-323)The archetype of the Self then functions to direct attention within to the possibility ofthe realization of an inner center of order and personal unity. With the world threatenedwith destruction, the Self can provide an inward source of meaning and unity.Archetypal manifestations are thus the compensatory response of the unconscious totypical human situations, with the response being a representation of an inherent patternof human functioning. In this way the"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Page 61archetype supplies the insight of a universal perspective to what are universallyexperienced problems. 15 This enables individuals to grasp the meaning of theirsituation in its more than personal aspect if an actual person appears in archetypal guisein dreams, for example, we can see that the activation of some universal human patternis complicating the personal relationship. A woman known to the dreamer may thenrepresent the anima archetype and hence be a vehicle of symbolic projection.16The Archetypes as Autonomous FactorsIn our Investigation of the conditions under which the archetypes come intoconsciousness, we have emphasized the similarity of behavior of archetypes to othercontents of consciousness in that their appearance is the result of the overallcompensatory influence of the unconscious. In this regard it must also be pointed outthat the archetypes behave in a similar fashion to the complexes of the personalunconscious, that is, they are autonomous factors. Thus, although archetypes as a rulearise in response to the needs of the individual, the end result of their activation may bethat the archetype subjugates or even possesses the person.The archetypes are then not only objects of consciousness but also subjects that can bedescribed as having intentionalities which may oppose that of the ego personality:They are spontaneous phenomena which are not subject to our will, and we are therefore justified inascribing to them a certain autonomy. They are to be regarded not only as objects but as subjects with lawsof their own. From the point of view of consciousness, we can, of course, describe them as objects, andeven explain them up to a point, in the same measure as we can describe and explain a living humanbeing. But then we have to disregard their autonomy. if that is considered, we are compelled to treat themas subjects; in other words, we have to admit that they possess spontaneity and purposiveness, or a kind ofconsciousness and free will. We observe their behaviour and consider their statements. This dualstandpoint, which we are forced to adopt towards every relatively independent organism, naturally has adual result. On the one hand it tells me what I do to the object, and on the other hand what it does (possiblyto me). (Vol. 11, p. 362)In describing the archetypes as autonomous factors, Jung wants to hold to thedistinction between the complexes as contents of the personal unconscious and thearchetypes of a collective unconscious. For the word \"complex\" is used primarily torefer to the autonomous contents of personal origin, to those contents that developontogenetically. The archetype, on the other hand, is inherited and thus seemsimpersonal in the sense that it cannot be explained in terms of the person's own lifehistory. Naturally, this clear separation between the personal and collective"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Page 62aspects of the unconscious is, in reality, always more or less an interrelation. For thecomplexes appear to have a nucleus which contains an archetypal component and thearchetypes are always manifested in images made up out of combinations drawn fromthe individual's store of experience. Nevertheless, it is still possible to discriminatebetween those contents of consciousness that owe their origin primarily to theindividual and his or her experience from those that are impersonal and that pointbeyond the individual.The archetype behaves like a complex, then, in that it is a locus of thoughts, feelings,and images that function in a unified way as a sort of personality. Rather than indicatingthat the archetypes are actually entities outside humankind, however, thepersonification that the archetypal images manifest are typical of autonomous contentswhich exist in the unconscious without being integrated with the conscious personality.The less acknowledgment and understanding an unconscious element is accorded, then,the more it tends to function independently of the conscious personality and evenassume the characteristics of a personality itself. And since the archetypes aresymbolic, numinous factors that do not originate from one's personal experience, theability to integrate them into one's personality has definite limitations. They are, in fact,wider than the individual; they have a universal, collective meaning that the individualcan only participate in but cannot hope to completely assimilate. There is often the realdanger that the archetypes will even assimilate the ego personality. \"It is perfectlypossible, psychologically, for the unconscious or an archetype to take completepossession of a man and to determine his fate down to the smallest detail.\" (Vol. 11, p.409) Plausible examples of this phenomenon are to be seen in the lives of Christ andHitler.The archetypes have a dual nature, being potentialities for both evil as well as good.Thus, what to one person proves to be a healing experience giving meaning to life, mayprove to another less stable consciousness to be a source of evil, disorientation, ormadness.Characterization of the Chief ArchetypesAmong the most common archetypes that show a distinct personality are the shadowarchetype and the into and animus. The shadow is a representation of the personalunconscious as a whole and usually embodies the compensating values to those held bythe conscious personality. Thus, the shadow often represents one's dark side, thoseaspects of oneself that exist, but which one does not acknowledge or with which onedoes not identify. In dreams it usually appears as a figure of the same sex as thedreamer."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The anima archetype appears in men and is his primordial image of woman. Itrepresents the man's biological expectation of women, but also is a symbol of a man'sfeminine possibilities, his contrasexual tendencies."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Page 63The experiences of one's mother and other actual women are a third contributing factorto the form of the archetype. The anima often appears in dreams as a strange orunknown woman. The animus archetype, the analogous image of the masculine thatoccurs in women, may appear as a series of strange men. 17The personification of the above archetypes is often of such a distinct character thatdialogues of significant therapeutic value can be carried on between the ego and theshadow or anima/animus in the conscious state. This form of communication with theunconscious was enthusiastically recommended by Jung. (Vol. 7, p. 201)In addition to the archetypes mentioned above, there are many other archetypes thatappear in personified form notably the Old Wise Man, the Great Mother, the EarthMother, the Divine Child and the archetype of the Self. Any attempt to give anexhaustive list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since thearchetypes tend to combine with each other and interchange qualities making it difficultto decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of theshadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus.One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the questionwhether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four orfive forms of a single type. There would seem, then, to be no definitive decisionprocedure for determining the exact boundaries of an individual archetype. For what isto count as a typical situation and thus indicate the presence of an archetype cannot bedecided a priori, so that for instance we cannot determine on the basis of generalconsiderations that there must be so many archetypes. And from the phenomenologicalpoint of view, the appearance of distinct types of archetypal images does not permit usto conclude anything definite about how many archetypes per se there may be.Therefore, it would seem evident that a complete cataloging of the archetypes in such away as to determine their exact number could not be accomplished except in anarbitrary manner.In addition to the personified forms mentioned above, there are many archetypes that donot appear in personal form. For example, the archetype of the Self may be manifestedas a stone, diamond, flower, or as a four-skied figure. Animals, plants, and naturalobjects such as the wind, a lake, or a mountain may also figure into archetypal images.There is in fact no determinate condition regulating what form an archetype mustassume. This is not to say, owe, that there are not definite conditions an image mustsatisfy in order to count as archetypal. But these conditions depend more on thefunction of the image in the overall context of the manifestation than they do on thespecific form."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"With regard to the question of personification, a paradoxical situation seems to existsince Jung says that all autonomous contents of the"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Page 64unconscious are personified. \"All autonomous psychic factors have the character ofpersonality,...\" (Vol. 10, p. 42) On the other hand, the archetypes, which presumably areall more or less capable of autonomous function in the unconscious, do not all appear inthe form of persons. It would seem clear, then, that personification is being used in ageneral sense to mean ascription of traits of personality to an entity rather thanimplying that what is personified must appear as a distinct personality or in the form ofa person.Archetypes and SynchronicityIn our discussion of the phenomenology of the archetypes, dreams have beenemphasized as a characteristic state of consciousness in which the archetypes come intoawareness. Fantasies and visions are other altered states of consciousness in whicharchetypes frequently appear. But in addition to these modes of manifesting themselves,Jung states that the archetypes may also affect nonpsychic physical processes. Thiseffect of the archetypes is described by Jung's theory of synchronicity. In synchronisticevents, then, there is a meaningful correspondence between a physical event and apsychic content with the possibility of a causal connection between the two having beenruled out. These events are the often recorded meaningful coincidences that seem todefy understanding in terms of either causality or chance.An example Jung describes from this therapeutic work serves to illustrate these ideas:A young woman I was treating had, at a critical moment, a dream in which she was given a golden scarab.While she was telling me this dream I sat with my back to the closed window. Suddenly I heard a noisebehind me, like a gentle tapping. I turned round and saw a flying insect knocking against the window-panefrom outside. I opened the window and caught the creature in the air as it flew in. It was the nearestanalogy to a golden scarab that one finds in our latitudes, a scarabaeid beetle, the common rose-chafer(Cetonia aurata), which contrary to its usual habits had evidently felt an urge to get into a dark room at thisparticular moment. (Vol. 8, p. 438)There would seem to be no plausibility of attempting a causal explanation here,although chance seems a possible rational explanation. Other examples of synchronisticevents, however, seem to eliminate the possibility of the meaningful coincidence beingthe result of the chance intersection of random events. A good illustration ofsynchronicity where chance is ruled out occurs in experiments attempting to verify thephenomenon of extrasensory perception, FSP. Jung referred to the card guessingtechniques pioneered by J. B. Rhine at Duke University. (Vol. 8, p. 432) These tests aresometimes structured so that the subject tries to guess the sequence of a deck of cardsbefore they are shuffled by a"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Page 65randomizing machine. As the subject is guessing the sequence of a future order of thecards, this of course also eliminates the possibility that the order of the cards can have acausal effect on the mental state of the subject.In the ESP tests the meaningful coincidence is between a content of consciousness, theperson's idea of what cards will appear, and the actual order of the cards. The archetypaltheory comes into play, then, as Jung says that an archetype is manifesting itselfsynchronously in both a psychic content and a physical process. The term\"synchronous\" is used instead of simultaneous in the formulation of the synchronistichypothesis to indicate that the meaningful coincidence between the psychic andphysical events need not occur at exactly the same time. The physical event can beslightly before or after the psychic content.In the ESP examples, it is the archetype of magical effect, the expectation that amiraculous event can occur, that seems to be at work. 18 Evidence for this is the factthat the results of the experiments are positively correlated with the emotional state ofthe subject, so that an enthusiastic, hopeful subject can score well above chanceprobability at the beginning of the experiments; and then his score will move toward thechance probability as the novelty of the experiments lessen, or if he becomes bored ordepressed. (Vol. 8, p. 434)The archetypal influence is clearly seen in the first example given. The woman patientwas at a crisis point in her analysis due to a too narrow rationalistic view that did notleave her sufficiently open to the possibility of change which could result from takingseriously the irrationally produced contents of the unconscious. The meaningfulcoincidence was then the turning point in this regard and produced the needed change inattitude allowing the analysis to progress to a successful conclusion. The scarab motif,moreover, is a classic symbol of rebirth (Vol. 8, p. 439) so that it would seem that thepatient's situation of impasse had constellated the archetype of rebirth and renewal.Jung postulates that an archetypal ordering principle is at work in these instances ofsynchronicity bringing about a situation in which an outer event and a psychic contentare expressions of the same meaning. The archetypes in these cases seem to be localizedas much in matter and in the environment as they are in the psyches of individuals:The psychoid archetype has a tendency to behave as though it were not localized in one person but wereactive in the whole environment. (Vol. 10, pp. 451-452)... the archetypes are not found exclusively in the psychic sphere, but can occur just as much incircumstances that are not psychic (equivalence of an outward physical process with a psychic one). (Vol.8, p. 515)"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Page 66The phenomena with Jung describes in his theory of synchronicity undoubtedly existand his efforts to take account of these events in his overall theory of the psyche seemsa worthwhile and needed endeavor. However, as we have previously noted, the theory ofsynchronicity leads Jung to make statements that cannot be unproblematicallyreconciled with his views as a whole when, as a consequence of reflections aboutsynchronistic phenomena, he suggests that the psyche need not be considerednecessarily dependent on the brain and that paychoid processes can operate at large inphysical nature (see pages 20-23). From the standpoint of our naturalistic reconstructionof Jung's theory of archetypes, then, the requisite strategy would seem to call for asetting aside of synchronicity so as not to implicate an already complex and manifoldtheory with additional theoretical notions of unusual difficulty and debatable cogency.In any event the concept of the archetypes is not logically tied to the notion ofsynchronicity. Although synchronicity may well require something like an archetypalhypothesis to make it intelligible, the reverse is certainly not the case. 19Archetypes and TemporalityOne final topic that must be taken up before our exposition of the archetypal theory iscomplete is the aspect of the changes in archetypes through time. Two distinct questionsseems to be involved. In the first place, are there emergent archetypes, that is, do newarchetypes come into being in response to the changing situation of human beings?Secondly, how can we account for the changes that archetypal images manifest throughtime as, for example, the changes that the God archetype undergoes when the Yahwehof the Old Testament is experienced as the Christian Trinity and Devil?It seems evident that an answer to our first question must hinge on our idea of the originof the archetypes. As will be remembered, it was concluded in this regard that thearchetypes are inherited in a similar fashion to other biological structures. If weassume, then, that human evolution operates according to the same principles that are atwork in other species where we can observe evidence for evolution working throughmany generations, we would expect that the chances of new archetypes coming intobeing through the evolutionary process would constitute a very low probability. For theevolutionary process works in an accumulative fashion in the sense that the origins ofnew structures occur, as a rule, as an addition to the pattern of the existing genotype.Highly evolved creatures, then, tend to be more complex organisms. Moreover, as astructure becomes highly evolved, there is less probability of major changes occurringin it, since the chance that single changes in the genotype will lead to an improvementin the overall structure compatible with the rest of the existing genotype is very small.We would not expect,"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Page 67then, the appearance of human beings with new basic structures for the body, a third eyeor an extra limb. These occurrences would be monstrosities rather than improvementsto be passed on to the next generation. Analogously, the origin of completely newarchetypes through evolution would seem to be unlikely, especially in the light of thebasic structuring function that the archetypes are held to play in the psyche. Thearchetypes are the phylogenetically old aspects of the psyche and hence those parts leastliable to be changed to the overall benefit of the organism. 20However, there are in fact distinctive aspects of human evolution that must be takeninto acount and that complicate the evolutionary script so far as development of psychicelements is concerned. The possibility has to be considered that there is acoevolutionary link operating between genes and culture in which culture itself acts as aselective pressure effecting the inheritance of genetic factors which in turn influencethe development of cultural forms. The sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson has workedout a detailed theory of gene-culture coevolution.21But even if Wilson's work is open to question, the distinctive nature of the culturalfactor in its effect on human evolution has to be taken into account. For with thedevelopment of culture, humans are no longer subject to the unmediated effects ofenvironment upon which the theory of natural selection is based. Moreover, a goodargument can be made for the case that the distinctive quality of Homo sapiens as aseparate species appears phylogenetically on an equal pace with the development ofculture. Thus, culture has to be seen as one of the prime movers in the rapidevolutionary development from the prehuman species to Homo sapiens. As innatefactors conditioning the development of the mythic and religious aspect of humannature, the archetypes must have undergone a rapid evolutionary development duringthe explosive emergence of Homo sapiens.Thus, if we are to understand archetypes as a natural part of the developing humanorganism this precludes the possibility that archetypes are eternal and unchanging likePlatonic forms.22 However, we must also be careful not to overestimate the rate ofchange in the genetic basis of archetypes. With the rapid and chaotic changes withwhich we are all too familiar in the latter half of the twentieth century, it is tempting toascribe at least part of the reason for so much change and diversity to basic changes inhuman nature. But, in spite of all the new cultural forms, human nature itself seems tobe relatively stable. For example, the rapidly changing technology of warfare seems tohave taken place in a setting in which the aggressive and conflictual basis of humannature seems alarmingly essentially unchanged from centuries past. It is very likelytherefore that a contemporary human is genetically very similar to what humankind was"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"like ten thousand years ago.And although it took only two million years for the rapid evolutionary"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Page 68development of the human brain and mind to result in the most advanced forms ofHomo sapiens starting from Homo habilis, 23 this is still a vast time scale comparedwith the approximately five to six thousand years of the entirety of human civilization.Thus, even though the prospect of changes in the genetic basis of archetypes has to beallowed as a possibility in the very long run, practically speaking new archetypes areunlikely to emerge in the foreseeable future. This is not a surprising conclusion for whatwould a completely new typical human situation be like corresponding to which newarchetypes could arise? It would seem that changes in the basic human situationbirth,marriage, initiation, work, friendship, recreation, deathcan only be variations ofsituations that have existed contemporaneously with the emergence of humankind as adistinct species.To account for the many changes in archetypal manifestation that can be readilyobserved in the history of civilization, we must then seek for another explanation ratherthan ascribing these variations to changes in the basic nature of the archetype itself, tofundamental changes in the archetypes per se. In this regard the crucial importance ofcultural and individual development in shaping the archetypal image must not beunderestimated, as the basic patterning influence of the archetype per se can take on aseemingly limitless variety of forms.Changes in the archetypal images of particular archetypes then mirror and keep pacewith cultural change. Rather than a dragon as the devouring monster, we have Jaws andAliens. E.T. becomes the magically helpful animal; the familiar clash of archetypalgood and evil is given a fresh twist as Star Wars, and the story of the Divine Child ispresented as Superman. The LIFO phenomenon is a particularly instructive example inthis regard:It is characteristic of our time that the archetype, in contrast to its previous manifestations, should now takethe form of an object, a technological construction, in order to avoid the odiousness of mythologicalpersonification. (Vol. 10, p. 328)Thus, although we do not expect there to be new archetypes per se, there are always newsymbols and new myths as the archetypal images undergo a gradual transformationunder the influence of changing culture corresponding to the varied personal andcultural background of the individual experiencing the archetypes.24"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Page 694Critiques of the Theory of ArchetypesIntroductory RemarksIN the preceding chapters we have reconstructed Jung's archetypal theory by way ofillustrating how the concept of the collective unconscious can be understoodnaturalistically so that the archetypes can be be seen as part of the natural order ratherthan as being possibly occult or supernatural entities. 1 Before continuing with the lineof reasoning designed to show how the theory of archetypes as reconstructed has alegitimate place within the domain of scientific investigation, we must in this chapterfirst consider various general criticisms of Jung's views of archetypes that attempt toundercut Jung's particular approach to the phenomena he describes irrespective of thescientific merit of the notion of the collective unconscious.The ambiguity and openness to different possible interpretations characteristic of Jung'sformulations gives the unsympathetic critic an abundance of possible avenues of attack.Jung is particularly vulnerable when passages are criticized out of their proper contextor without regard to what is said in other writings. For it is frequently necessary to readJung's explanation of a theoretical point in several different writings in order to gain acomplete understanding of what he is saying in light of the overall development of hisideas. Jung, then, offers more than the usual difficulties for the reader,2 and as aconsequence, a significant amount of Jungian criticism is grounded in misunderstandingof Jung's basic ideas. We will be content here with two examples of this type ofcriticism. Rather than being instances of simple errors, they are more aptly described as''...a mixture of distortion and misunderstanding, which is obviously motivated by illwill.3The first sample comes from the pen of Philip Rieff. In the passage below, thisunfortunately influential critic slides from a discussion of the role of fantasy inmediating the experience of the archetypes to two subsequent passages on the samepage where it is apparent that he is"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Page 70equating \"illusion\" and \"archetype.\" Although Rieff may feel that the archetypes areillusions, it should not be supposed, as he implies, that this in any way approximatesJung's meaning of the term. It would seem that Rieff wants the reader to think thatbecause archetypal images can be produced through a type of fantasy activityJung callsit \"active imagination\"archetypes are then merely \"forms of fantasy\" 4 in the sense ofbeing a system of illusions:What exactly is this \"creative impulse\" which Jung sets up as the highest activity of man? On first glance,one would think it is merely a new term for art, but actually Jung implies something much more general,public as well as private. What Jung means by fantasy is, in a word: illusion....More than ever before, then, both the high culture and the individual sense of well-being depended, fortheir very existence, on erotic illusions. If old illusions no longer functioned satisfactorily, then they mustbe replaced by \"something new.\" Jung dedicated his life to the production of something new in the way ofsaying illusions....Jung despised the fundamental \"unspirituality\" implied by Freud's suspicious treatment of the dynamics ofthe unconscious. Just there, in the unconscious, are those superior illusions that would compensatemankind for the barren interdicts of Christianity and the almost equally barren interdicts ofpsychoanalysis.5Our second sample of misconceived criticism comes from Edward Glover, whose bookFreud or Jung? is the fortunately as yet unsurpassed nadir of anti-Jungian literature.The following statements reveal that he fails to appreciate even so basic an idea as theimportance of the unconscious in Jung's psychology. Glover is apparently unaware ofthe distinction Jung draws between collective consciousness and the collectiveunconscious and thus deduces the absurdity that Jung is actually proposing a brand ofconscious psychology:Now in so far as Jung is convinced of the overwhelming importance of the Collective Unconscious (and itmust be remembered that although he appears to be sincerely convinced of this, he also adducesconsiderations which if correct would reduce its importance to the level of purely conscious forces andfactors) he is clearly an ardent champion of the constitutional factor.... Indeed it is hard for any Freudianwho takes the trouble to immerse his mind in Jungian psychology to avoid the horrid suspicion that Jung isnothing more or less than a pre-Freudian who having at first let himself he carried in the stream of Freudianthought has ever since striven to make his peace with conscious psychology.6But, by thus dismissing from further discussion criticisms based on misunderstandingsof what Jung's archetypal theory implies, we must not then also exclude certainsystematically biased critiques. These criticisms are based not so much on amisunderstanding of what Jung says as on the failure to see how Jung's archetypes canbe made comprehensible within"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Page 71the scope of a particular conceptual framework for understanding human experience. 7Consequently these critiques recur as a type or species of criticism that adherents of agiven intellectual persuasion typically raise against Jung in regard to the archetypes.What is at stake, then, in the consideration of such systematic critiques is theintelligibility of the archetypal hypothesis from the perspective of a given image ofhumankind. Criticism from such a point of view could readily be understood as havingbegged the questions at issue. However, this consideration is not a sufficient reason todisregard the criticisms discussed below. For in addition to helping us understand thepoint of common types of criticism, we must consider whether the phenomena forwhich the archetypes purport to provide an explanatory framework could not beaccounted for in less cumbersome ways. Perhaps from the perspective of these otherimages of humankind, archetypes can be shown to be no longer necessary. At any rate, adiscussion of such criticism will better enable us to gain a critical viewpoint on Jung'simage of humankind.8Psychoanalytic CriticismIf we consider, then, the characteristic criticism of Freudians to the archetype concept,this is usually a claim to the effect that all unconscious contents can be accounted for interms of an individual's personal history without the need for an hypothesis of acollective unconscious. According to this line of argument, the latter should then beeliminated in favor of a more parsimonious explanation couched in developmentalterms. As a case in point, Glover argues as follows:...but at the very least we must examine the embryonic stages of individual development to see whetherthey could not account satisfactorily for those mental contents that led Jung to develop his theory of thecollective or racial unconscious.9...many Jungian archetypes are capable of adequate explanation in terms of purely individual thought butalso that so long as we have not fully explored the early forms of individual thinking, the validity anduniversality of the collective archetype is under strong suspicion.10A second representative instance of Freudian systematic criticism is taken from NandorFodor's Freud, Jung, and Occultism. In the passage cited below, he gives examples ofdreams that from the Jungian point of view would provide good paradigm cases ofarchetypal images. He concludes that these images can be adequately understood interms of Freudian psychology without the need for a concept of a collectiveunconscious of archetypes:The chief point of interest, however, is whether the concept of the Old Wise Man and the archetype oftransformation make any novel contribution to the interpretation of the dream. They do not. Unconscious"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Page 72guidance and sublimation cover the situation just as well. The spiritual element is a beautiful unconsciousfantasy. The Jungian contribution is only verbalbut it is stimulating and appeals to the imagination. 11Was then the Carpenter of his dream an archetype of the Self or just a personification of the integratingdrive? It makes no difference whichever way you look at it.12[Archetype of the] Shadow or neurosis. It makes no difference. The meaning is the same.The Jungian approach yields nothing that the Freudian does not imply.13In considering the force of this type of objection, it is important to note that what is atissue is not the existence of the phenomena for which the archetypal theory is to providean explanatory framework so much as how these phenomena are to be interpreted. TheBritish psychoanalyst Anthony Storr admits for example that: \"It is not difficult toprove the existence of an inner world of highly irrational images;...\" 14 and \"Theexistence of the mythological substratum to human experience is recognized by analystsof entirely different theoretical orientations, though they would use anothernomenclature.\"15Although Fodor and Glover argue that Freud's psychology can account for the imagesalleged to be archetypal without need for any theoretical adjustment of basic Freudiantheory, another school of psychoanalytical thought has developed a concept of \"internalobjects\" to account for the type of phenomena at issue. This neo-Freudian school iscomposed of those influenced by the writings of Melanie Klein. According to theKleinian view, then, the images that Jung would call archetypes are the result of aprocess of introjection in which items of experience in the child's immediateenvironment such as the mother's breast are internalized and become incorporated intothe child's ego as internal objects.In the passage cited below, we see an example of how this explanatory device ofintrojection of internal objects attempts to account for the allegedly archetypal imageswithin the context of an essentially Freudian psychology that explains unconsciousimages in terms of individual development:In reality parents and child possess limited power of goodness and badness, wisdom and foolishness. Thechild's phantasy makes gods and demons and all those unearthly creatures of them which folklore andmythology, religious legends and artistic creation present to us in sublimated, and the imagination of theinsane in more unsublimated, form. Moreover, the child places his self-created figures inside his own bodyand treats them as live entities alien to himself and beyond his control.16The proper Jungian reply to this line of criticism will appeal to evidence"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Page 73that the images said to be archetypal have collective features that rule out aninterpretation solely in terms of individual development. The reasoning in support ofthe collective nature of such features will consist of a demonstration of thecorrespondence of the images with symbols in the history of culture that are unknown tothe individual previous to his imaginal experiences. Thus the spontaneous appearance ofthe same symbols in cultures widely separated in space and time will be seen asnecessitating a concept of the collective unconscious.The soundness of such reasoning is naturally open to question in various ways. In thecase of the individual who experiences allegedly archetypal images, bow is the absenceof previous cultural influence established, for example? Moreover, would not a theoryof cultural diffusion better account for the appearance of the same symbols in differentcultures?However, the sort of systematic attack on the archetypal theory with which we areconcerned here is not so much interested in directly impugning the evidence for acollective unconscious as it is in trying to show how its own interpretive frameworkmakes the allegedly archetypal phenomena intelligible without the need for a concept ofa collective unconscious. We will then reserve an examination of the evidence given insupport of the collective unconscious for a later chapter (pages 133-138). For it is ourtask in the present section to indicate the manner in which the Freudians and Kleinianssee the Jungian interpretation of the phenomena at issue as not merely false orunsupportable by the evidence given, but as violating basic assumptions they appear tohold about the nature of humankind.The sort of assumption on which the tension between the Jungian and Freudian imagesof humankind seems to turn involves the issue of description of human experience interms of \"spiritual\" predicates. As will be recalled from previous discussion (pages 44-48), we were unable to grasp what Jung means by the spiritual until we had contrastedthe spiritual and instinctual. The spiritual was said to be that which channels theenergies of human beings into cultural activities for their own sake, thus representing adetermination of human activity that can function autonomously of instinctualdetermination understood in a narrow, physiological sense- The emphasis of the Jungianimage of humankind is then on the existence of a source of creative symbolic activitythat may manifest itself in artistic, religious, and even scientific ways, but which is notto be understood merely as an outgrowth of sexuality.By contrast, what might be characterized as a Freudian image of humankind seeks toexplain all aspects of human activity in terms of the development of the individual'sinstinctuality. Thus, the attempt is made to give the so-called spiritual aspects of"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"humans a reductive biological interpretation. Since it is difficult to see how creativesymbolic activity relates directly to the biological needs of the individual, it is easy tobelieve from this perspective that the symbolic manifestations must be either"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Page 74infantile phenomena or delusions. Thus, Storr states:As will be perceived, I am putting forward suggestions as to possible myths which can be variouslyregarded either as paranoid delusions or as religious beliefs.... I think that Kleinians and Freudians wouldargue that religious beliefs are as unnecessary as delusions, provided a man has sufficiently rewardinginterpersonal relationships. 17Psychoanalysts consider that the inner world and its images are infantile phenomena, admittedly powerfuldeterminants of a man's idea of the external world, and therefore of his behavior, but actually a hindrancein adaptation to reality. The mythological level of the psyche is, in this view, a misconstruction whichought to be outgrown or overcome if a person is to be properly orientated toward people in an adult way,and toward the external world as it actually is.18This way of understanding as instinctual perversities that which from the Jungianperspective constitutes mankind's human-most potentialities for being seems to lead toan incomplete and nondescriptive image of the human situation. The suspicion thatthere has been an effort to explain away a vitally important aspect of experiencethrough a biological reductionism is reinforced by the often emotionally worded attackson Jung. If the archetypes were really only infantile phenomena or delusions, then onewonders if they would elict such emotional counterattacks. As a case in point Gloverstates that \"...he [Jung] proceeds to invest human ideas and images with an atmospherepolitely described as mysticism, but which the less polite observer would call anatmosphere of religiosity.\"19With such differing ways of looking at the human condition as that represented in thewriting of Freud and Jung, we cannot attempt here to provide conclusive arguments infavor of Jung's views versus those of Freud. Such a task would carry us beyond thepurpose of this study. In so far as what we say here about Jung and his theory ofarchetypes proves to be intelligible and to offer a genuine gain in understanding thehuman situation, this may perhaps count against a Freudian perspective, if a comparisonwith Freud's ideas fails to provide an equally satisfactory explanation. But beyond whatwe have said about the archetypes, no effort will be made to conclusively validate theimportance of a spiritual dimension to experience. Such a question cannot be resolvedonly through argumentation, but must be settled as the course of time proves therelative merits of the Freudian or Jungian images of humankind.20In any case, it seems evident that the claim that the archetypal theory must be rejectedon grounds of parsimony cannot be upheld. For although it is readily admitted thatJung's archetypal theory is a more cumbersome theoretical device than Freudianexplanation in terms of individual development, in contrast to Freud, Jung's idea ofarchetypes reflects the characteristic quality of the objects of experience it seeks toexplain. To charge Jung with violation of parsimony is thus beside the point until"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"another theory can provide a simpler explanation that at the same time is"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Page 75able to adequately characterize the phenomena.Jung's view has an obvious advantage over Freud in that, in dispensing with the ideathat dreams and other unconscious products are systematically distorted by theunconscious, Jung can have his theoretical explanations of the images in closeagreement with the phenomenological content. The actual content of the images mustthen for Jung be taken seriously, not as mere disguises for sexuality.A passage from Fodor serves to illustrate this point. He once had a dream involving acoal mine and under the influence of having read Jung attempted a Jungian type ofexplanation in terms of the archetype of transformation. 21 His interpretation alongthese lines proceeds in part:Coal preeminently stands for transformationof vegetate life (and imprisoned sunshine) into stone.Moreover, coal is something valuable; it is called black diamond, not quite without reason, as both coaland diamond are made of carbon.... Treasure is undoubtedly referred to and, if it is the mine or if it is to bemined, It has been mined from the unconscious.22Then in an attempt to discount the importance of this interpretation he remarks: \"It isinteresting to note that, under the influence of Jung, I completely ignored the obviousuterine element in the coal mine...\"23 The interpretation of the coal mine as uterus doesnot have much phenomenological plausibility; that is, we fail to see on what groundsthe interpretations of the coal mine as representing a uterus can be adequately defended.If a coal mine is a uterus, then any enclosed space could on the basis of this reasoningbe a uterus and any elongated object a penis.By comparison with the Freudian interpretation, the Kleinian theoretical model can takethe phenomenology of the images successfully into account. However, its explanatorydevice of the introjection of internal objects lacks credibility and empirical foundation.The internal objects thesis seems to be, moreover, a sort of ad hoc addition to theFreudian theory, an attempt to save at any cost the perspective of explanation in termsof individual development.Perhaps someday a theory will succeed in accounting for what Jung calls \"archetypes\"without the necessity of a concept of collective unconscious and yet without explainingaway the phenomena. However, there is no good reason to believe that the Freudian orKleinian approach is in fact such an account.24Theological CriticismThe second type of systematic criticism we will discuss comes from the theologicalpoint of view. Rather than the archetypal theory with an alternative psychological"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"interpretation of events as was the case with the Freudian and Kleinian approaches, thetheologians are concerned with"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Page 76the issue of psychologism. They object to Jung's theory of archetypes since, in theirunderstanding, Jung's theory attempts an illegitimate psychological reduction of thetranscendental concerns of religion. In regard to the psychological interpretation ofreligious assertions, Father Josef Goldbrunner thus remarks that: \"In the language ofscience this thinking of Jung's must be called psychologism, the levelling down ofsupra-psychic realities to the level of purely psychic reality. 25 it is, then, not so muchthe theory of the archetypes to which the theologians object, as it is Jung's use of thetheory to understand and explain religious experience in a psychological way thatattempts to be metaphysically neutral with respect to such issues as the existence ofGod.The Jewish theologian Martin Buber voices this type of criticism of Jung. He feels thatJung's psychological treatment of God in terms of a God archetype has the effect ofmaking God into an entity that has reality only within the psyche. Thus, he accuses Jungof overstepping the legitimate scientific bounds of psychology and indulging in a typeof psychologically based theology:In short, although the new psychology protests that it is \"no world-view but a science,\" it no longercontents itself with the rô1e of an interpreter of religion. It proclaims the new religion, the only one whichcan still be true, the religion of pure psychic immanence.26Jung does not exercise such a restraint when he explains that God cannot exist independent of men. For,once again, if this is a statement about an archetype called God, then the emphatic assurance that it is apsychic factor is certainly unnecessary (What else could it be?). But if it is a statement about some extra-psychical Being which corresponds to this psychic factor, namely the statement that no such Being exists,then we have here, instead of the indicated restraint, an illict overstepping of boundaries.27The validity of Buber's criticism must be evaluated in the face of what Jung has to sayabout God. Jung distinguishes God-as-he-experienced, the psychic God-image or Godarchetype, from a possible God entity transcending possible psychic experience towhich the God-image could correspond. In terms of his scientific methodological idealof avoiding undecidable metaphysical claims, Jung's assertions about God are then to berestricted to psychological statements about the God-image:Psychologically, however, God is the name for a complex of ideas grouped round a powerful feeling; thefeeling-tone is what really gives the complex its characteristic efficacy,.... (Vol. 5, p. 85)The idea of God is an absolutely necessary psychological function of an irrational nature, which hasnothing whatever to do with the question of God's existence. The human intellect can never answer thisquestion, still less give any proof of God. Moreover such proof is superfluous, for the"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"Page 77idea of an all-powerful divine Being is present everywhere, unconsciously is not consciously, because it isan archetype. There is in the psyche some superior power, and if it is not consciously a god, it is the \"belly\"at least, in St. Paul's words .... Our intellect has long known that we can form no proper idea of God, muchless picture to ourselves in what manner he really exists, if at all. The existence of God is once and for allan unanswerable question. (Vol. 7, p. 71)What Jung says above about God seems relatively unproblematic. However, Jungfrequently uses his God-image construct in ways that imply that it has the samemeaning as the ordinary traditional religious usage of God:\"Absolute\" means \"cut off,\" \"detached.\" To assert that God is absolute amounts to placing him outside allconnection with mankind. Man cannot affect him, or he man. Such a God would be of no consequence atall.... this urge to regard God as \"absolute\" derives solely from the tear that God might become''psychological.\" This would naturally he dangerous. An absolute God, on the other hand, does not concernus in the least, whereas a \"psychological\" God would be real. (Vol. 7, p. 235, note 6)Yet Jung is not agnostic and affirms his personal view that there is something to whichthe psychological Gad-image corresponds:This is certainly not to say that what we call the unconscious is identical with God or is set up in his place.It is simply the medium from which religious experience seems to flow. (Vol. 10, p. 293)We find numberless images of God, but we cannot produce the original. There is no doubt in my mind thatthere is an original behind our images, but it is inaccessible. (Vol. 18, p. 706)All that I have learned has led me step by step to an unshakable conviction of the existence of God. I onlybelieve in what I know. And that eliminates believing. Therefore I do not take His existence on beliefIknow that He exists. 28From these different perspectives from which Jung talks about God, we can begin tounderstand why his views attract theological criticism. For Jung believes that he canrestrict himself to the \"facts\" of religious experience and that without committinghimself to any metaphysical assertions arrive at certain valid empirical statementsabout God-as-he-is-experienced. But since these assertions will be based on a cross-cultural comparison of religious symbology, they may come into conflict with thedogma of a specific religion where the archetypally based religious experiences haveundergone a prolonged period of interpretation.Thus, Jung says that the doctrine of the privatio boni and its implication: \"Omne bonuma Deo, omne malus ab homine\" is not"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Page 78supportable by existing archetypal evidence:...I have felt compelled to contest the validity of the privatio boni so far as the empirical realm isconcerned....Criticism can be applied only to psychic phenomena, i.e., to ideas and concepts, and not to metaphysicalentities. These can only be confronted with other metaphysical entities. Hence my criticism is valid onlywithin the empirical realm.... It seems to me, however, that the existing empirical material, at least so far asI am acquainted with it, permits of no definite conclusion as to the archetypal background of the privatioboni. Subject to correction, I would say that clear-cut moral distinctions are the most recent acquisition ofcivilized man. (Vol. 11, pp. 305-306)For the most part, however, Jung feels that his empirical formulations leave the dooropen for at least theoretical compatability with metaphysical religious statements basedon faith. Since these metaphysical statements, such as the assertion that a Cod existswho transcends the psyche, are supported by faith rather than by experience, they cannotbe either empirically validated or disproved. For even the numinous experience of theCod archetype reveals only that a certain psychically conditioned factor exists.Thus, Jung's reply to theological criticism is that he is making empirical statementsabout the God archetype rather than uttering metaphysical truths. He is not talkingtheologically but scientifically:You evidently did not know that epistemologically I take my stand on Kant, which means that an assertiondoesn't posit Its object So when I say \"Cod\" I am speaking exclusively of assertions that don't posit theirobject. About God himself I have asserted nothing, because according to my premise nothing whatever canbe asserted about God himself. All such assertions refer to the psychology of the God-image. Their validityis therefore never metaphysical but only psychological. All my assertions, reflections, discoveries, etc.have not the remotest connection with theology but are, as I have said, only statements aboutpsychological facts. (Letters, Vol. 1, p. 294, letter to Josef Goldbrunner dated 8 February 1941)In spite of all Jung's protests of innocence, the theologians have nonetheless goodreasons to be upset with Jung's archetypal treatment of religion. It is not that Jung hasexplained away religion by reducing it to psychologyhis psychological logical treatmentmaintains the authentic existence of numinous experience that transcends reference tothe personal ego to an indeterminable extent. Rather the difficulty is that the Jungianimage of humankind with its archetypal understanding of the spirit is in real conflictwith a traditional religious viewpoint based on faith. Thus, although Jung is attemptingto approach religious concerns from a strictly empirical point of view and is notadvocating that his view be interpreted in a religious way, it is hard to avoid perceivingthe manifest incompatibility"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Page 79with a traditional religious viewpoint For if one holds Jung's theory of archetypes to betrue, then traditional religious understanding can only claim to be a relative and limitedinterpretation. In a letter Jung once admitted this point:If the Christian truth is not supreme and solely valid, then it believes it has lost its raison d' être and, if Imay express my humble opinion, it would have lost it. It would instantly have to turn into a sort ofphilosophical syncretism. I think that this is a most serious point. (Letters, Vol. 1, pp. 269-270, letter to W.E. Hocking dated 5 May 1939)Jung's claim, then, is that all experience that could count as supporting a religiousunderstanding, since it must be a psychic experience, falls within the domain of histheory. The religious interpretation of this experience is thus always open to questionand to possible psychological critique:...I approach these problems in a way that has often been charged with \"psychologism.\" If \"psychology\"were meant, I should indeed be flattered, for my aim as a psychologist is to without mercy themetaphysical claims of all esoteric teachings.... Let the convinced Christian believe, by all means, for thatis the duty he has taken upon himself, but whoever is not a Christian has forfeited the charisma of faith.(Perhaps he was cursed from birth with not being able to believe, but merely to know.)... One cannotanything metaphysically, one only can do so psychologically. Therefore I strip things of their metaphysicalwrappings in order to make them objects of psychology. (Vol. 13 p. 49)The fact that I am content with what can be experienced psychically, and reject the metaphysical, does notamount, as any intelligent person can see, to a gesture of scepticism or agnosticism aimed at faith and trustin higher powers, but means approximately the same as what Kant meant when he called the thing-in-itselfa \"merely negative borderline concept.\" Every statement about the transcendental is to be avoided becauseit is only a laughable presumption on the part of a human mind unconscious of its limitations. Therefore,when God or the Tao is named an impulse of the soul, or a psychic state, something has been said aboutthe knowable only, but nothing about the unknowable, about which nothing can be determined. (Vol. 13,p. 54)Such a position, although technically leaving open a loophole for religious faith,undermines the grounds for believing in the extrapsychological truth of such faith, thatis, a truth that would be more than just valid relative to a particular psychologicalperspective. The choice of one religious interpretation of archetypal experience overanother or over an atheistic interpretation must then be on the basis of which particularroot metaphor one finds congenial to their psychology.Moreover, there is some real question to what extent Jung is successful in maintaininghis discourse about religious concertos on a solely"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Page 80empirical, psychological level. The appropriation of the emotionally loaded word Godto mean the psychological God-image opens him up to the criticism that he is indulgingin theological discourse. In his Jung, Gods, and Modern Man, Antonio Morenocomplains then that \"Jung, the philosopher-psychologist, interprets man's ideas of Godwithin the framework of his own ideas of God.\" 29 Works such an Answer to Job leavethe impression that what is being expressed is more a personal religious testament thanan objective psychological discussion.The claim that Jung's theory of archetypes constitutes a psychologistic treatment ofreligion is then justified in the sense that his theory offers a psychological frameworkfor understanding with which a traditional religious perspective can be madecompatible only by assuming the subservient role of an undecidable metaphysicalinterpretation based on the so-called archetypal facts.The question remains, however, to what extent this \"psychologism\" is the basis for avalid criticism of the archetypal theory. For the fact that psychologism can beestablished does not necessarily mean that something is wrong with the theory. It wouldseem clear that psychologism is an objection only to a misuse or misapplication of thearchetypal theory rather than to the theory itself. If, for example, the claim is made thatthe psychological perspective is the only valid way to understand a religious,philosophical, or aesthetical work or event, then there exists the manifest possibility ofan illegitimate reductionism. Freud's psychologistic understanding of religion and art interms of sublimation of sexuality seems an example of this pernicious \"nothing but\"30psychologistic application of a theory.But surely there is a legitimate psychological element in religion, art, and philosophythat can be discussed without the implication that these disciplines are nothing butconfused psychology. Jung's application of the archetypal theory beyond psychology tothese other areas is for the most part sensitive to this problem. But, of course, examplescan be found where Jung is guilty of failing to appreciate a work in its own termsbecause of his awareness of the psychological element. He seems to arbitrarily dismissthe philosophies of Georg Hegel and Martin Heidegger in this manner....Hegel, who in my very incompetent opinion is not even a proper philosopher but a misfiredpsychologist. His impossible language, which he shares with his blood-brother Heir, denotes that hisphilosophy is a highly rationalized and lavishly decorated confession of his unconscious. (Letters, Vol. 2,p. 501, letter to Joseph F. Rychlak dated 27 April 1959)Moreover, it can be readily seen how it is Jung's Kantian strategy that brings him intodirect conflict with the theologians.

For there is no longer the necessity for themisleading emphasis on the merely phenomenal nature of the God-image weexperience. 31But with the abandonment of this Kantian distinction, the question about theindependent subsistence of archetypes reappears. For instead of the archetypes beingonly psychic entities, the psyche could be considered as just one place in which theymanifest themselves.32 The alternative thus presents itself to interpret the archetypes astranscendent metaphysical entities.Our argument against such an interpretation in terms of what we have called \"anaturalistic reconstruction\" can now be shown to have the advantage of helping toseparate the scientific alms of a theory of archetypes from unnecessary metaphysicaland theological complications. For Jung was perhaps misguided in believing that Kant'sdoctrines would preserve the scientific character of his theory and prevent metaphysicaland theological discourse in its name. it is not clear that Kant succeeded in preventingthe claims of science and religion from becoming competing systems of explanation,and, in any case, Jung in fact fails to strictly adhere to Kant and sometimes indulges indiscourse that is of a metaphysical and theological nature.

Rather thanattempting to refute the archetypal theory, it might well be said that Hillman loves it todeath. For he applies it so universally that the theory becomes a kind of ideology interms of which all phenomena have to be interpreted. Thus, rather than attempting todemonstrate how the archetypal theory can be construed so as to meet scientific criteria,Hillman would judge science by archetypal standards.Although it might seem that Hillman's interpretation of the archetypal theory wassimply another equally valid perspective with which to understand the archetypalphenomena so that we do not have to choose between Jung's original version andHillman's alternative, the radical nature of Hillman's metapsychological viewsnecessitates a detailed rebuttal. For to accept Hillman's ideas on the relationshipbetween science and archetypes would mean that Jung's whole project of areconciliation of a theory embracing archetypal phenomena with the scientific world-view is fundamentally mistaken. Thus, there are real incompatibilities betweenHillman's and Jung's views of archetypes and these incompatibilities need to beaddressed before the idea of a rapprochement of an archetypal theory with science canbe accepted as a meaningful and viable enterprise."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"Page 84Characterization of Hillman's Views on ArchetypesA major difference in Hillman's approach from Jung's original formulations is evidentin his rejection of the distinction that Jung made between archetype per se andarchetypal image. Hillman rejects this distinction because he wants to avoid the Kantianidealism he sees inherent in it in which the archetypal images would represent thephenomena and the archetypes per se the equivalent of the noumena in Kant's system. 1As we have previously discussed in chapter 3, the archetype per se, archetypal imagedistinction does not have to be construed in a way that implies acceptance of a Kantianidealism. However, the considerations that were brought forth there do not fully addressthe real import of Hillman's objection to the distinction. For Hillman wants to focusattention on the imaginal aspect of archetypes as opposed to anything to which thearchetypal image might possibly be said to refer or stand for.In fact, the image has no referent beyond itself, neither proprioceptive, external, nor semantic: \"imagesdon't stand for anything\" (Hillman, 1978a). They are the psyche itself in its imaginative visibility; asprimary datum, image is irreducible.2Another related part of Hillman's view is his rejection of Jung's distinction between thepersonal and the collective aspects of the unconscious. All psychic manifestations arethus to be interpreted archetypally no matter how personal they may seem:(Platonism never made a sharp separation between your or my personal soul and the soul in general, just asarchetypal psychology cannot separate the personal and the collection unconscious, for within everycomplex, fantasy, and image of the personal psyche is an archetypal power.)3If we consider the mythos/logos categories mentioned in the introduction, thenHillman's program in general is one of highlighting the mythos as a way ofunderstanding the world to the denigration of the logos. if we take dreams as arepresentation of the mythos for purposes of illustration, it is as if Hillman wanted tosay that the dream is real, but the external world to which the dream refers is relativelyunreal. This position contrasts with Jung's attempt to legitimate the reality of the dreamwhile respecting the reality of the external world, and is an inversion of a positivisticposition that affirms the reality of the external world while denying any meaningfulsense to dreams.4 Hillman, in fact, actually speaks of dreams in this fashion:The dream is not compensation but initiation. it does not complete ego-consciousness, but voids it.5"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Page 85We must reverse our usual procedure of translating the dream into ego-language and instead translate theego into dream-language. 6The imaginal perspective assumes priority over the natural organic perspective.7Hillman arrives at this radical and rather startling view by extending Jung's notion thatarchetypes underlie and structure all of our conceptions. \"The archetypal positionimplies that all knowing may be examined in terms of these psychic premises. Itsuggests nothing less than an archetypal episteme*, an archetypal theory of knowing.\"8Rather our aim is to remember that all knowledge can be psychologized. And that by being psychologized,it also becomes a means of psychological reflection. Therefore all teaching is relevant to the soul as long asits literalism is psychologized. Every statement in every branch of learning in every university departmentis a statement made by the psyche through men and women and is a psychological statement.9From Hillman's perspective, everything must be experienced as an image of the psychein order to be experienced at all. Moreover, since these psychic images are conditionedby archetypes, the fantasy images must be in some sense ultimately real sinceeverything is reducible to them, but they are just what they appear to be:All consciousness pesos upon fantasy images. All we know about the world, about the mind, the body,about anything whatsoever, including the spirit and the nature of the divine, comes through images and isorganized by fantasies into one pattern or another.... Because these patterns are archetypal, we are alwaysin one or another archetypal configuration, one or another fantasy, including the fantasy of soul and thefantasy of spirit.10To hold that \"we are not real\" means that the reality of persons and every act of consciousness is areflection of a fantasy-image: for these are the only actual existents that are not reducible to somethingother than their imagery; only they are as they literally appear, only fantasies are utterly, incontrovertiblyreal.11In Hillman's view, what psychology ought to be involved in, its proper work, is theexplication of the archetypal perspective in all of experience. This appreciation of thepervasiveness of the archetypal Hillman calls \"psychologizing.\" But to see thingsmythically from the standpoint of archetypes will mean to see them metaphorically,since the mythologems are understood by Hillman to be metaphors. \"Archetypes aresemantically metaphors.\"12 Thus, psychologizing will also mean \"deliteralizing\" so thatnothing is taken as literally what it is except the archetypal images themselves.\"Through psychologizing I change the idea of any literal"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Page 86action at allpolitical, scientific, personalinto a metaphorical enactment.\" 13The net result of Hillman's position is that psychology itself gets deliteralized. For inseeing all psychology on the model of depth psychology,14 the entirety of what Hillmanwould acknowledge as the proper domain of psychology falls outside of the objective,literal realm of science. Psychology and science become incompatible:So it would seem that an adequate psychology must be one that cannot take itself or any of its ideasliterally.15Psychology is thus not a discipline of truth, as is science or philosophy or theology.16They [Freud and Jung] could not free themselves from psychological conceptualizing, and so they tendedto conceive myths metapsychologically (whereas we are trying to imagine our metapsychologymythically).17We might well call Hillman's position \"imaginative realism.\" It is clear that such aview, if tenable, rules out the possibility of the kind of scientific realism that Jung isaiming for in his efforts at rapprochement with a scientific viewpoint in his archetypaltheory.Hillman's perspective at first sight seems to be a potentially reasonable one vis-a-visJung's original position. For as Ernst Cassirer can argue for the primacy of the logos andJung for an equiprimordiality of logos and mythos, then Hillman's view as the thirdoption, the primacy of the mythos seems open for exploration and development. IfHillman's position is a legitimate third point of view, then it would seem that thedifferences between Hillman and Jung could not be settled in a straightforward way. Foras Jung and Hillman come from different starting assumptions about the relationsbetween mythos and logos, this would seem to mean that they inevitably argue througheach other. However, there are several serious drawbacks to Hillman's view of theprimacy of the mythos, and, because of these difficulties, it is questionable to whatextent Hillman's position constitutes a genuine alternative to Jung's outlook on mythosand logos. Moreover, notwithstanding any real inconsistencies that might be shown toplague Hillman's perspective, there are also some undesirable consequences attendantupon acceptance of his view that must be understood before we see his position aspossibly supplanting Jung's outlook.But before we can fully appreciate what is entailed by the Hillman line, we mustendeavor to discover more of its underlying logic. in this regard it is clear that, inopting for the primacy of the mythos, Hillman is arguing from a kind of romanticappeal where the literal is dissolved into metaphor and truth into poetry. FromHillman's point of view, myth and reality seem to coincide. This is still acceptable as"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"long as Hillman is intent on merely"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Page 87showing us the myth in every reality. But is Hillman arguing only that there is fantasyin everything or additionally that, in the final analysis, is just a fantasy, that everythingreduces to fantasy?In an analogous fashion, we might argue that there is me in every statement But then wecould not conclude that every statement is a metaphor. Clearly we are not justified inconcluding the latter from the former, unless we also want to assert that the differencebetween the two terms is a distinction without a difference.But Hillman does not in fact seem to be straightforwardly arguing against themeaningfulness of a distinction between these terms. In the following example, heclearly acknowledges a legitimate role to the literal and hence the logos:We should hasten to qualify that psychologizing does not mean only psychologizing, or that statementsmay not have content, merit, and import in the area of their literal expression. Philosophical and scientificassertions are, of course, not only psychological statements. To reduce such assertions wholly topsychology commits the psychologistic fallacy, or \"psychologism.\" This point is important. 18But if Hillman is not arguing that the literal is really metaphor and reality really justfantasy, that is, that the logos is merely another form of the mythos, then on whatgrounds can he advocate the primacy of the mythos? Moreover, what is the basis for thedifference that Hillman draws between Jung's view and his own on this question? Forthe less radical aspect of Hillman's program, the emphasis on the mythos aspect inevery logos expression, does not seem to differ significantly from Jung's original viewsince Jung would certainly agree that every aspect of reality is, to some extent, involvedin metaphor, fantasy, and myth.It is clear that the intent of Hillman's program of psychologizing is not so much to denydifferences between logos and mythos altogether, but rather to weaken the distinctionand level down the differences by emphasizing the common fantasy element in bothmythos and logos. The argument will then be that, since fantasy is a common element inevery human endeavor, the perspective that articulates and understands this dimension,that is, the mythos, has got to be more fundamental than that which is understood andarticulated, the logos. Thus, Hillman argues that depth psychology (i.e., his archetypalpsychology) is more primordial than a scientific psychology since both aremanifestations of the soul, and depth psychology grasps this point whereas scientificpsychology does not:But the psychological perspective is supreme and prior because the psyche is prior and must appear withinevery human undertaking. The psychological viewpoint does not encroach upon other fields, for it is thereto begin with, even if most disciplines invent methods that pretend to keep it out.19"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Page 88Whether psychologists can stand for it or not, psychology inherently assumes superiority over otherdisciplines, because the psyche of which it is the advocate does indeed come before any of itscompartmental activities, departmentalized into arts, sciences, or trades. 20Thus, there can be no outside of myth and fantasyno way to break through to any truthunconditioned by the mythos. Hillman's claim for the primacy of the mythos amountsthen to the assertion that the mythos perspective is more ultimate and more basic thanany other. The logos may have its own legitimate functions, but these do not impinge onthose of the mythos. The logos can then be safely ignored and we can talk as if certainaspects of reality were just mythos. Because of this the mythos is not accountable to thelogos, that is, it is independent of logos judgment:In fact, the categories of logic and number, of science and theology, could themselves be reduced (i.e., ledback) to more basic metaphors of myth. No concepts, no matter how general and abstract, could embracethe range of these archetypal metaphors.21Its fantasy of itself [an adequate psychology] must be one that allows psychologizing to continue as anopen process of ideation. It may not be based upon axioms and laws, or even rely upon hypotheses.Instead it will have to consist of fictions.22Our premises present a world that escapes both the demands of logic for definition and the demands ofempirical science for demonstration. Fictions take their place in the realm traditionally reserved for thesoul, between the world of spirit (metaphysics and intellect) and the world of nature (science and senseperception). They furnish psychology with its own psychic premises, not borrowed from metaphysics andthe sciences, which offer a mode of seeing through metaphysics and the sciences. 23Critique of Hillman's ViewAt least part of the credibility of Hillman's position rests on a situation where themythos terms, myth and fantasy, are understood in one sense figuratively, and inanother sense literally. We can best approach this point by considering the phrase: themyth of science. Science is a sort of myth too. From Hillman's point of view, science isanother fantasy of the soul. But is science just a fantasy of the soul? Is the myth ofscience really the same kind of thing as say the myth of Icarus? Hillman's view seemsto imply the latter. But when we say the myth of science, the word ''myth\" is being usedin a metaphorical sense. Science involves a myth in the same way that every rational orirrational endeavor involves myth, that is, they all fall under the influence of onearchetype or another. But this fact does not itself denigrate the difference between whatwe come to accept on the basis of science and what we perceive through mythic fantasy.in other words, just because of the universal scope of influence of archetypes, the realdifferences we want to acknowledge between science and myth"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Page 89remain largely unaffected. Within the context of the \"myth\" of science, we still havescientific knowing and mythic expression of timeless truths.Moreover, the fact that the great scientific theories are based on theoretical models thatinvolve extended metaphors does not really weaken the difference between science andmyth. For the essence of science is the eventual accountability of these models to literaltruth conditions determined by experimental outcomes.In addition, Hillman's attempt to elevate the mythos to primacy by denigrating theimportance of the logos fails just because of the inevitable interdependence of these twoperspectives. For just as we cannot really ever get rid of or totally dispense with themythos, we cannot literalize our speech totally, for example, so also is the logosdimension unexpungeable from experience. Hillman would have us focus all ourawareness on the mythos perspective disregarding almost totally any logos aspect. inregard to dreams, for example, he wants us to focus on the images and disregard anythought about what the images might mean in respect to translating their significancefor events in the everyday world. But this simply will not do because the mythos isitself meaningless unless it does relate at least indirectly to the logos perspective ofthings. Dreams are meaningless unless they have at least some indirect relation to ourwaking, nondream world. Metaphors, likewise, are meaningless without an implicitrelation to the literal world. For we evaluate the mythos not entirely in terms of itself,but also in terms of how it helps us to appreciate and understand the logos. We judgemetaphors, then, on how well they serve to illuminate the nonmetaphorical.Although Hillman says that he wants to deliteralize psychology and understand hismetapsychology mythically, it is unlikely that he can really stick with this and avoidinconsistency. He cannot say, for example, that his point of view is only a fantasy or anextended metaphor, and at the same time that his position is superior to Jung's and animprovement over his original perspective, as is clearly implied by his polemicalrhetoric attacking Jung's views.Moreover, Hillman's inconsistency in asserting that his psychology is not concernedwith truth while also arguing for the superiority of his way of looking at things indicatesthe impossibility of getting around the logos. Although we can deny the logos andpretend we are not considering it, the logos perspective gets smuggled back into ouroutlook. Hillman is not content, then, to simply assert that his purported deliteralizedpsychology is simply another style of psychologizing. He means us to see it as theenlightened way to do psychology.

The difference is easy to lose as is illustratedby these quotes:The imaginal has become real; for many, the real.29A study of man can never give a sufficient perspective, for man is fundamentally limited; he is a frailbrotos, thnetos, a poor mortal thing, not fully real. Gods are real.30Although Hillman speaks in the name of the mythos, the inescapability of the logosmeans that his approach really has the effect of functionally merging the two. Thisconflation of the mythos and logos is then one distinct disadvantage of taking theHillman line.But the credibility of Hillman's outlook is also considerably weakened by its ideologicalcharacter that has a ready-made answer to any criticism Any point of view from whichwe might criticize Hillman, from a scientific or theological perspective, for instance,can be \"seen through\" as just another manifestation of fantasy, as just more illustrationsof the viewpoint itself. Hillman has claimed an epistemological stance more primordialthan any nonpsychological point of view and thus not really subject to criticism fromany other perspective.

Jungian psychologyas a whole then loses credibility to the extent that it becomes identified with whatHillman is doing. For until the archetypal theory is able to meet its critics andeventually gain widespread acceptance in its present or some modified form, Hillman'sradical use of the theory simply confuses the issues.Thus, although aspects of Hillman's perspective on the archetypal theory may havesomething of value to offer as an alternative model in terms of which to understandarchetypes, Hillman fundamentally fails to demonstrate that his overall outlook on themythos and logos is superior to Jung's original position, and that Jung's attempt toachieve a reconciliation with science is misconceived.

Certainly such works as Answer to Job are meaningful andinsightful though most probably not science. Jung was too complete an individual tohave been only a scientist, and his writings often reflect his extrascientific views andinterests. But the fact that Jung at times exceeds the accepted boundaries of scientificinquiry, as in Job, is all the more reason to assess the scientific nature of the archetypaltheory. For the many facets of Jung's personality philosopher, therapist, \"speculatingheretic\" (Vol. 11, p. 307), scientist invite the unsympathetic and shortsighted critic todismiss Jung's views carte blanche as hopelessly unscientific or \"mystic.\" In order toshow why the archetypes merit serious scientific study and consideration, we must thenaddress ourselves to the questions surrounding the alleged scientific status of thearchetypal theory.Outline of an Approach to the QuestionOur approach to the question of the scientific nature of Jung's theory of archetypes willof necessity be a rather indirect one.

That is to say, we mustshow how the theory can meet various objections that constitute reasons on the basis ofwhich the designation \"scientific\" would be an inappropriate description of it.In terms of extant criticism, the most prevalent criticism of Jung's theory in this regardis the accusation that it is in some sense a mystical rather than a scientific approach tothe phenomena. Although it can be rather easily shown that Jung's theory is not an overtand serf-conscious attempt at mystical utterance, an examination of the context ofissues out of which the question of mysticism arises serves as an introduction to thequestion of the manner in which the archetypal theory can meet criticism that itrepresents a paradigmatically unscientific approach. With the limited issue of therelation between mysticism and the archetypal theory clarified, then, more generalquestions concerning the issue of an unscientific approach can be brought into focus.Our treatment of these more general questions will entail an examination of Jung'sscientific attitude, that is, the way in which Jung understands the archetypal theory to bescientific in principle. In regard to this issue, two pivotal questions will prove to be theproblem of the relation between a scientific discourse about archetypes and anextrascientific discourse, and the question of the manner in which the archetypal theorycan satisfy acceptable criteria of rationality for a scientific theory, that is, whether ornot the theory in the final analysis will prove to be sufficiently grounded in the logos. inaddition to the treatment of these questions, our examination of whether Jung's theoryof archetypes is implicated with a patently unscientific approach must also consider theissue of Jung's methodology (pages 119124), the manner in which Jung understands hisstudy of archetypes to employ a legitimate scientific method. 1As the examination of the question of mysticism leads us into discussion of moregeneral issues, our approach will be to see in what way Jung understands his theory tobe able to meet these challenges to its scientific nature. We will then attempt todetermine to what extent Jung's scientific intentions are in fact carried through andwhether or not they are adequate for the task of articulating the theory in such a waythat it can be clearly shown to be a legitimate scientific enterprise.The Charge of MysticismIn attempting to gain perspective on the question of the scientific validity of the theoryof archetypes, we must begin by considering the issue of mysticism.

For example, in an article entitled \"the Mystical and ScientificAspects of the Psychoanalytic Theories of Freud, Adler, and Jung,\" Edward Burchardstates:But it is only in Jung [in contrast to Freud and Adler] that we find a conscious and deliberate repudiation ofrationality and empirical science and a lush proliferation of concepts which are indistinguishable in formand intention from those of Christian and Oriental religious mystics. 2In a similar vein Paul Friedman and Jacob Goldstein echo the theme of the employmentof a paradigm ally unscientific approach:Jungian psychology, with its emphasis on the archaic and its tendencyto passive preoccupation with symbolic content, stands in strong contrast to therationalism and determinism characteristic of Western thought in general and ofmodern science in particular.3Philip Rieff, although not employing the pejorative term \"mysticism,\" criticizes theJungian point of view from a similar standpoint by stating that Jung's ideas arevalidated from the perspective of revelation rather than scientific method:There is no arguing with revelation. Jung's was a personal language of faith, revelatory, and thereforebeyond danger of being invalidated by argument or contrary experience....Against the democracy of the scientific intellect, he represents the aristocracy of emotional profundity.4Because it offers no criteria of validity, other than the therapeutic experience of conviction, Jungian theoryamounts at once to a private religion and an anti-science.5Before the question of the scientific credibility of the archetypal theory can be criticallydiscussed, there must be a clearing of the air concern mysticism. For although it maywell seem that \"mysticism\" signifies nothing other than \"unscientific\" when used todescribe an allegedly scientific theory,6 we still need to discover the reasons for thischaracterization of Jung's views. For an examination of the possible grounds forascription of the label of mysticism will lead us beyond the narrower question of Jung'sappeal to mystical frameworks of understanding to the more general issues of therationality of the archetypal theory and the relation of scientific and extrascientificdiscourse about archetypes.However, our discussion of these more general considerations must wait until we haveindicated what relationship exists between Jung's idea"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Page 96of archetypes and mysticism.

But, before we can address this task,it will he necessary to first gain an understanding of what is meant by mysticalexperience.Mysticism CharacterizedW. T. Stace in his Mysticism and Philosophy argues that genuinely mystical experiencecan he divided into two basic types. A so-called extroverted mystical experience is to hedistinguished from an introverted one. In the extroverted experience, there is a \"...unifying vision, expressed abstractly by the formula 'All is One.' The One is... perceivedthrough... the multiplicity of objects.\" 7 Thus, the extroverted mystic perceives aoneness of all things that is distinguishable from the individual things themselves. Theintroverted mystic, on the other hand, experiences a oneness in a consciousnessotherwise devoid of all ideational content. \"The Unitary Consciousness, from which allthe multiplicity of sensuous or conceptual or other empirical content has been excluded,so that there remains only a void and empty unity.\"8In addition to the experience of oneness, Stace lists other characteristics shared by bothtypes of mysticism: \"Sense of objectivity or reality. Feeling of blessedness, joy,happiness, satisfaction, etc. Feeling that what is apprehended is holy, or sacred, ordivine.... Paradoxicality....Alleged by mystics to he ineffable,...\"9Is Jung a Mystic ?If we accept Stace's criteria of mystical experience as constituting a satisfactoryguideline for determining what types of experience could he called mystical in a strictsense of the term, the question then presents itself: is Jung a mystic from the standpointof personal experience? Although we wish to focus on the crucial issue of whether Jungattempts to defend his archetypal theory from the point of view of a mysticalframework of understanding, the issue of Jung's personal mystical experience is alsorelevant since the case for arguing that Jung's ideas appeal to a mystical justificationwould be strengthened if we could establish that he had first hand experience ofmystical states of consciousness.10 For in light of the usually intense nature of suchexperiences, we would have good reason to expect that such experience would have"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"some influence on the development of Jung's overall viewpoint."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Page 97In regard to Jung's personal mystical experience, we discover, then, that although JungIn his autobiography reports several instances of paranormal psychic experiences, andIn one case an out-of-body experience, plus visions, and instances of hearing voices orconversing with spirits, 11 there do not seem to have been any genuine cases of mysticalexperience. Moreover, in deciding about the nature of Jung's altered states ofconsciousness, it is important to note that the visions and voices that Jung describes donot qualify as genuine mystical states. Stace points out that visions and voices are notreally mystical phenomena:Not only is this the opinion of most competent scholars, but it has also been the opinion which the greatmystics themselves have generally held.12The main point is that the most typical as well as the most important type of mystical experiences isnonsensuous, whereas visions and voices have the character of sensuous imagery. The introvertive kind ofmystical states are, according to all the accounts we have of them, entirely devoid of all imagery.13On the basis of the negative evidence, then, we might feel justified in concluding thatJung had no genuine mystical experiences. For In view of the disclosure of the types ofunusual experiences that Jung does reveal in his autobiography, it would be reasonableto expect a description of a mystical state had there been one to report.But if we can conclude that from the standpoint of personal experience Jung is not amystic, the question remains as to the extent of a possible appeal to a mysticalframework of understanding In justifying his views on archetypes. That is, we need tounderstand the relation that exists between mysticism and Jung's archetypes in order toexamine the possibility that Jung means his archetypal theory to be understood from anessentially mystical point of view in terms of which a scientific approach with itsappeal to publicly observable data and empirical criteria of validation would not beapplicable. Justification of the archetypal theory in terms of a mystical framework ofunderstanding would involve, then, essentially an acceptance of mystical experience asan inexplicable and irreducible datum in terms of which other aspects of experiencecould be understood, but which would not itself be considered as a type or kind of moregeneral experience; it would mean an abandonment of the logos for a one-skied mythospoint of view.As a first approach to understanding the relation between mysticism and Jung's ideas, itis important to note that, at least in regard to the Introverted mystical state, Jung arguesagainst its possibility. That is, in terms of the first characteristic, he says the experienceof a oneness in a consciousness devoid of all thought, imagery, and sensation isimpossible:"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Page 98\"As long as Sunyata 14 is cognized by a subject it remains object.\" But when the subject enters Sunyataand becomes identical with it, the subject itself is Sunyata, namely void.

There can also be no memory of it, because there wasnothing....I want to know what there is to be known, but I don't want to make assumptions about things of which Iknow that one cannot know them. Thus it is absolutely impossible to know what I would experience whenthat \"I\" which could experience didn't exist any more. One calls this a contradictio in adjecto. Toexperience Sunyata is therefore an impossible experience by definition, as I explained above, and it is alsoimpossible to experience consciousness in a field of which I know nothing. (Letters, Vol. 1, p. 263, letter toW. Y. Evans-Wentz dated 9 February 1939)It would seem that Jung's comment that the introvert mystical experience is \"impossibleby definition\" needs qualification. For although we can argue with the mystic about themeaning of his experience and how it should be interpreted, we are less open to questionthat he had an experience. Thus, Jung is opposed to one of the ways in which mysticsmost commonly characterize their experience, the characterization of it as a oneness ina consciousness devoid of all multiplicity. For in terms of Jung's own framework ofunderstanding, what happens in the mystical experience is that there is a lowering of thethreshold of consciousness that allows an experience of the unconscious:It is psychologically correct to say that \"At-one-ment\" is attained by withdrawal from the world ofconsciousness. in the stratosphere of the unconscious there are no more thunderstorms, because nothing isdifferentiated enough to produce tensions and conflicts. (Vol. 11, pp. 498-499)Now if consciousness is emptied as far as possible of its contents, they will fall into a state ofunconsciousness, at least for the time being. in Zen, this displacement usually results from the energy beingwithdrawn from conscious contents and transferred either to the conception of \"emptiness\" or to the koan.As both of these must be static, the succession of images is abolished and with it the energy whichmaintains the kinetics of consciousness. The energy thus saved goes over to the unconscious andreinforces its natural charge to bursting point (Vol. 11, p. 551)Since Jung understands the mystical experience as analogous to other more familiartypes of experience of the unconscious (e.g., dreams or visions), he then wants to saythat the feeling that the bounds of the ego have been dissolved and that the experiencerhas become merged with the oneness he experiences cannot be what it seems to be.

One is conscious of something. As long as you areconscious of Sunyata it is not Sunyata, because there is still a subject that is conscious of something(Letters, Vol. 1, pp. 249-250, letter to W. Y. Evans-Wentz dated 8 December 1938)As Jung understands the mystical experience, then, it involves only a relativizing of theego perspective of consciousness rather than a complete elimination of it.In addition, Jung's standpoint also amounts to a denial of the mystic's claim that hisexperience is of something outside himself, that is of something objectively real. It isnot a direct experience of the essence of reality that the mystic enjoys, but only aninsight into the unknown depths of himself. Of course from the psychological point ofview, Jung is trying to restrict himself to the phenomena and avoid metaphysicalassertions. However, the force of Jung's objections to the mystic's way of construing hisexperience as seen in the above quotations seems to be the argument that thepsychological interpretation of mysticism in terms analogous to other more commonexperiences of the unconscious is at least consistent with psychological common sense,whereas the mystic's characterization of it is not It is clearly evident, then, that Jung'sunderstanding of mystical experience is one that is expressed in terms which conflictwith the mystic's own way of interpreting his experience.However, in spite of the fact that Jung disputes some of the claims the mystic makes forhis experience on psychological grounds, he nonetheless considers the mysticexperience as one of considerable value and significance. This is not really surprisingsince Jung understands mysticism as an experience of the unconscious. Consequentlythe value of the mystical experience is due to the positive effects of the expansion ofconsciousness that a direct insight into the unconscious makes possible. The experienceaffords an opportunity to realize the limitations of the perspective of ego consciousnessand thus helps to bring about the process of individuation, the goal of which is anintegration of the conscious and unconscious aspects of the personality.The occurrence of satori 16 is interpreted and formulated as a breakthrough, by a consciousness limited tothe ego-form, into the non-ego-like self. (Vol. 11, p. 543)So far as Western mysticism is concerned, its texts are full of instructions as to how man can and mustrelease himself from the \"I-ness\" of his consciousness, so that through knowledge of his own nature hemay rise above it and attain the inner (godlike) man.

(Vol. 11, p. 547)From our discussion of the relation between mysticism and Jung's views as a whole, wecan conclude, then, that Jung does not appeal to a mystical framework of understandingin advocating his theory of archetypes since, rather than understanding the archetypesfrom a mystical point of view, he understands mysticism in terms of his ideas of theunconscious.But if we have established that Jung does not defend his theory of archetypes by explicitappeal to a mystical perspective, there is yet an aspect of uncertainty about mysticismin relation to Jung's archetypes. For even if we can clearly show that Jung does notintend his theory to be understood as an expression of an essentially mystical viewpoint,the question remains as to the extent to which there is in fact a similarity betweenaspects of mysticism and the theory of archetypes. For example, what we have saidabout the numinosity of archetypal experience (page 44) agrees well with the mysticalcharacteristic of \"feeling that what is apprehended is holy, or sacred, or divine.\"Concerning the mystical quality of \"alleged ineffability,\" it is more difficult to makecomparisons. For it is not clear what sense it makes to talk about degrees or kinds ofineffability. In any case, the mystical ineffability is related to the quality ofparadoxicality in that paradoxical descriptions that violate basic laws of logic seemappropriate for its description. This way of talking about the mystic experience is thenanother way of stating the inability of language and logic to adequately express theinexpressible.The language which he finds himself compelled to use is, when at its best, the literal truth about hisexperience, but it is contradictory. This is the root of his feeling of embarrassment with language. 17But even though Jung does not follow the mystic in an explicit appeal to thetranscendental domain of the ineffable, it might well be argued that there is,nonetheless, some similarity between the description of a mystical experience asineffable and the ascription of numinosity to characterize archetypal experience. Thepoint needs to be made, then, that although presumably all allegedly ineffableexperience would be numinous, that is, charged with a great deal of emotional energy,Jung does not claim that the numinous experience of archetypes is ineffable. In thisregard we need to examine what Jung says about the paradoxical and also consider towhat degree the indeterminate nature of symbols, that is, the fact that they refer beyondthemselves to an indeterminable extent, constitutes a kind of ineffability. Thesequestions which serve to bring to focus the issue of the rationality of the archetypaltheory will be discussed in a later section (see pages 110-119).18 For the present it issufficient to remark that them is a certain family resemblance between mysticism in"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Page 101the strict sense and some of the things Jung says about the archetypes.

Forthe claim that Jung's theory is quasi-mystical must, in any case, be examined on thebasis of the individual reasons for such a contention; and, to the understanding of theseveral relevant questions involved, the quasi-mystical label contributes nothing.Having established that Jung is not attempting to propound an expression of mysticalviews, the relevant question is then not the extent to which his theory is a mystical one,but whether m the absence of an explicit appeal to a mystical viewpoint, the theory isnonetheless an instance of a paradigmatically unscientific approach, that is, oneopposed in principle to an attitude necessary for science or one that employs anunscientific methodology.Jung's Altitude Toward ScienceIntroductionWe turn now to the question of Jung's scientific attitude. With regard to his theory ofarchetypes, we need to ask whether Jung holds views incompatible with an attitudenecessary for science. The objection could be raised at this point that this question is anad hominem type of consideration. For regardless of what beliefs an investigator holdsconcerning the nature of the scientific endeavor, the issue of whether his theoriesconstitute good science must in any case be resolved in terms of what the theories cando in relation to acceptable scientific standards. However, in Jung's case therelationship he envisions between science and his archetypes is a very crucial concern.On the one hand, it is not always clear that Jung intended his theory of the archetypes tobe understood as a scientific theory. in the following passage, for example, Jung seemsto be very close to the position we have outlined as James Hillman's viewpoint wherethe logos is seen as a subset of the mythos:Psychology, as one of the many expressions of psychic life, operates with ideas which in their turn arederived from archetypal structures and thus generate a somewhat more abstract kind of myth. Psychologytherefore translates the archaic speech of myth into a modern mythologemnot yet, of course, recognized assuchwhich constitutes one element of the myth \"sciences\" (Vol. 9-A, p. 179)Looking at archetypes from this perspective then leads us to ask: Is the systematic studyof archetypes to be understood as one branch of science, or is science merely onemanifestation of archetypes? For if the latter should prove to be the case, we could notexpect a scientific evaluation of the theory to be the most appropriate way to determineits validity.On the other hand, even if Jung does want to see archetypes as falling"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Page 102within the scientific domain, the question remains as to the extent to which he reallysucceeded in being scientific as opposed to merely claiming an empirical basis for whatis essentially a speculative mythological view, thereby confusing the mythological withthe scientific. 19 Jung seems particularly vulnerable to this charge since he claims to bestudying myths scientifically and to be doing so phenomenologically, that is, taking intoaccount the phenomena in their totality.As we have emphasized in the introduction, Jung's goal is to do justice to the mythoswhile maintaining an accountability to the logos perspective, thus respecting bothmythos and logos and not seeking to subsume one totally to the other. Undeterred by theirrational nature of the subject matter, Jung wanted to achieve an empirically groundedand scientifically defensible theory of archetypes.20 For example he says: \"I saw that somuch fantasy needed firm ground underfoot, and that I must first return wholly toreality. For me, reality meant scientific comprehension. I had to draw concreteconclusions from the insights the unconscious had given meand that task was to becomea life work.\" (Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 188)However, in addition to a detached, objective study of archetypal events, Jung alsoadvocated for therapy and was personally involved in efforts to interpret the meaning ofthe archetypal images from philosophical and religious viewpoints. Thus, Jung'sattention is engaged at both the meta-level of archetypal events, theorizing aboutarchetypal phenomena, and at the object-level in the direct experience of the archetypalimages. In his clinical work, Jung endeavored to have his patients directly experiencethe archetypes and work through to a personal philosophy of life and religious outlook.Although it would be an exaggeration to say that Jung always succeeds in sharplydistinguishing these levels of discourseall too often he takes the distinction for granted,thus leading to many confusionsthe point to be made is that Jung sees the distinction asan essential one that can preserve the scientific character of an archetypal theoryindependently of particular interpretations of the significance of the archetypal images.Thus, we must not be mislead by passages, such as the one quoted above, where Jungtalks about the scientific myth. For Jung recognizes the pervasiveness of the mythicalelement in all experience, and the sense in which it can be said that all aspects of lifeare reflections of the archetypes, as well as seeing the particular value in the scientificmethod in offering a critical counterpoint and rational container for the fascination andpower of the archetypal images.We find, then, some cases where Jung defends the practical and therapeutic value of ametaphysical-religious outlook against an attempt to eliminate it entirely in favor of aworld-view dominated by the findings of science and other places where Jung defends"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"the necessity of a metaphysically neutral approach for science:"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Page 103No science will ever replace myth, and a myth cannot be made out of any science. For it is not that \"God\"is a myth, but that myth is the revelation of a divine life in man. it is not we who invent myth, rather itspeaks to us as a Word of God. (Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 340)There is, however, a strong empirical reason why we should cultivate thoughts that: can never be proved. Itis that they are known to be useful. Man positively needs general ideas and convictions that will give ameaning to his life and enable him to find a place for himself in the universe. (Man and His Symbols, p.76)My subjective attitude is that I hold every religious position in high esteem but draw an inexorable dividingline between the content of belief and the requirements of science. (Letters, Vol 1, p. 125, letter to PaulMaag dated 12 June 1933)As a scientist I have to guard against believing that I am in possession of a final truth. (Letters, Vol. 1, p.346, letter to H. Irminger dated 22 September 1944)The Scientific and the TherapeuticThe close interrelation between the scientific level of discourse and the level ofpersonally meaningful interpretation that we observe in Jung's writings is, as previouslymentioned, a direct result of Jung's therapeutic involvements. For Jung is sensitive tothe practical, therapeutic as well as the strictly theoretical, scientific aspects of hiswork. in order to make Jung's views on the nature of science intelligible, then, we needto more fully explore the basis for the particular tensions we find in Jung's viewsbetween what he sees as theoretical scientific knowledge on the one hand versussubjective, therapeutically relevant understanding on the other.On this account what is necessary is to show how, on the one hand, when one goes fromthe scientific perspective of theoretical knowledge about archetypes to the therapeuticperspective one in effect makes a move not only from theoretical to practicalknowledge, but also from the scientific to the religious and philosophical. On the otherhand, we need to determine to what extent Jung understands the tension between the twolevels of discourse about archetypes as due to an incommensurability between theoryand practice, between scientific versus therapeutic aims, and to what extent Jung istrying to argue for an idiographic versus nomothetic type of distinction within the realmof theoretical knowledge itself. 21Now if we address ourselves to what Jung sees as an incommensurability in principlebetween his scientific theory and the practical work of therapy, it is not at all clear whythis sort of incommensurable relationship must exist. For after all, it would seem thatscientific knowledge about psychological matters would prove in the long run to betherapeutic. We can easily imagine paradigm cases of \"unscientific\" therapy such as awitch doctor treating a case of hysteria by trying to cast out the demon"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Page 104responsible Even if the witch doctor succeeds and produces a cure, our scientificmentality assumes that suggestion or some such mechanism must be at work for whichthere exists a scientific explanation which, if known, would prove eventually to betherapeutically valuable. From the scientific point of view, then, we assume that thereare discoverable principles at work in human psychology, which if we knew them,would greatly decrease the gap between our theoretical knowledge and what can beaccomplished in terms of practical applications to therapy. From this point of view, it issimply the immaturity of science that leads to an incommensurability between theoryand practice.But this is not the sort of incommensurability between theory and practice that Jungprincipally has in mind. For parenthesizing for the moment idiographic considerationsin terms of applicability of a theoretical knowledge for understanding the individual, itmust be emphasized that Jung sees theoretical, scientific knowledge as necessary butnever sufficient for accomplishing the work of psychotherapy. For it is characteristic ofJung's conception of therapy that it is necessary for the therapist to enable the patient toreorganize his philosophical and religious viewpoint. Therefore, for Jung, it is not thatscience is rejected in doing therapy, but that objective scientific knowledge aboutpsychology must be complemented with a subjectively meaningful reorientation of theworld-view. The Jungian therapist has to have competence, then, from both the mythosas well as the logos perspective. 22The intellect is the sovereign of the scientific realm. But it is another matter when science steps over intothe realm of its practical application. The intellect, which was formerly king, is now merely a ministerascientifically refined instrument it is true, but still only a tool; no longer an end in itself, but merely aprecondition. (Vol. 6, p. 57)... sooner or later it was bound to become clear that one cannot treat the psyche without touching on manand life as a whole, including the ultimate and deepest issues, any more than one can treat the sick bodywithout regard to the totality of its functions ... (Vol. 16, p. 76)I can hardly draw a veil over the fact that we psychotherapists ought really to be philosophers orphilosophic doctorsor rather that we already are so,... We could also call it religion in statu nascendi, for inthe vast confusion that reigns at the roots of life there is no line of division between philosophy andreligion. (Vol. 16, p. 79)The most healing, and psychologically the most necessary, experiences are a \"treasure hard to attain,\" andits acquisition demands something out of the common from the common man.As we know, this something out of the common proves, in practical work with the patient, to be aninvasion by archetypal contents. (Vol. 16, p. 82)The statement that Jung sees scientific knowledge and psychotherapy"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Page 105as incommensurable irrespective of the state of the completeness of scientificknowledge amounts then to the claim that Jung believes that science cannot serve as asubstitute for the religious and metaphysical needs of humankind in terms of which theJungian therapy is primarily oriented. For the mythos and logos each have their ownfunctions to fulfill and cannot be collapsed into each other.When Jung talks about what he calls \"psychological truth,\" he is emphasizing thissubjective aspect of the therapeutic process for which the term scientific is notappropriate precisely because of the philosophical and/or religious nature of thequestions involved. Psychological truth is that which as a matter of fact proves to bemeaningful to the individual.Considered from the standpoint of realism, the symbol is not of course an external truth, but it ispsychologically true,...Psychological truth by no means excludes metaphysical truth,... (Vol. 5, p. 231)Is there, as a matter of fact, any better truth about the ultimate things than the one that helps you to live?(Vol. 11, p. 105)When an idea is so old and so generally believed, it must be true in some way, by which I mean that it ispshologically true. (Vol. 5, p. 7)In his Ego and Archetype, Edward Edinger furnishes an illuminating example ofessentially what Jung has in mind by emphasizing the subjective nature ofpsychological truth, that is, its grounding in the perspective of the mythos:These are abstract, objective meanings conveyed by signs. However, there is another kind of meaning,namely, subjective, living meaning which does not refer to abstract knowledge but rather to apsychological state which can affirm life. It is this sense of the word we use when we describe a deeplymoving experience as something meaningful.... It is the failure to separate these two different usages of theword \"meaning\" which leads one to ask the unanswerable question, \"What is the meaning of life?\" Thequestion cannot be answered in this form because it confuses objective, abstract meaning with subjective,living meaning if we rephrase the question to make it more subjective and ask, \"What is the meaning of mylife,\" it then begins to have the possibility of an answer....... \"Who am I?\" The latter question is clearly a subjective one. An adequate answer can come only fromwithin. Thus we can say: Meaning is found in subjectivity. 23This example from Edinger amply shows the subjective and essentially philosophicalemphasis in Jungian therapy. But this subjective therapeutic emphasis should notmislead us into overlooking the possibility of a valid scientific level of understanding.Jung, for example, does attack the question of the meaning of life in general. His answerin terms of a theory of individuation purports to be an objectively valid account of thepsychology"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Page 106of the various stages leading to a fulfillment of the personality and self-realization.We must be careful, then, to distinguish between subjective, psychologically truestatements and scientifically valid statements about psychological truth. Whereas in thefirst case we have what is found by the individual to be subjectively full of meaning, inthe second case we have generalized statements concerning what has, as a matter offact, been found to be meaningful.When psychology speaks, for instance, of the motif of the virgin birth, it is only concerned with the factthat there is such an idea, but it is not concerned with the question whether such an idea is true or false inany other sense. The idea is psychologically true inasmuch as it exists. (Vol. 11, p. 6)But whereas from the scientific, theoretical point of view, psychological truth is theobject of study; in the actual therapeutic situation, we are no longer on a meta-level ofpsychological truth, so to speak, but on the object-level working directly with thepatient's \"myth,\" that is, his life outlook. Moreover, it is just when the scientist-therapist moves from the objective scientific level of discourse about the unconsciousto the level of personal psychological truth that Jung emphasizes the importance oftaking what prove to be essentially idiographic considerations into account. In thepractical therapeutic situation, we must, in Jung's view, be prep to set aside ourtheoretical psychological knowledge to a large extent so that we can gain anunderstanding of the individual who may deviate from the scientific ideal case to agreater or lesser degree:Theories in psychology are the very devil. it is true that we need certain points of view for their orientingand heuristic value; but they should always be regarded as mere auxiliary concepts that can be laid aside atany time. (Vol. 17, p. 7)He [the therapist] should remember that the patient is there to be treated and not to verily a theory. For thatmatter, there is no single theory in the whole field of practical psychology that cannot on occasion provebasically wrong. (Vol. 16, p. 115)Thus, Jung likes to emphasize that science is nomothetic in nature being concerned withthe lawlike behavior of classes of particulars, whereas in therapy it is just theidiographic particularities of the individual that need to be understood. Instead of anomothetic/ideographic terminology, Jung talks in terms of knowledge versusunderstanding.Every theory of complex sync processes presupposes a uniform human psychology, just as scientifictheories in general presuppose that nature is fundamentally one and the same. (Vol. 6, p. 490)"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Page 107Hence it is not the universal and the regular that characterize the individual, but rather the unique.... At thesame time man, as member of a species, can and must be described as a statistical unit; otherwise nothinggeneral could be said about him.... This results in a universally valid anthropology or psychology. as thecase may be, with an abstract picture of man as an average unit from which all individual features havebeen removed. But it is precisely these features which are of paramount importance for understandingman.... I can only approach the task of understanding with a free and open mind, whereas knowledge ofman, or insight into human character, presupposes all sorts of knowledge about mankind in general. (Vol.10, p. 250)And if the psychologist happens to be a doctor who wants not only to classify his patient scientifically butalso to understand him as a human being, he is threatened with a conflict of duties between the twodiametrically opposed and mutually exclusive attitudes of knowledge on the one hand and understandingon the other. This conflict cannot be solved by an either/or but only by a kind of two-way thinking: doingone thing while not losing sight of the other.In view of the fact that, in principle, the positive advantages of knowledge work specifically to thedisadvantage of understanding, the judgment resulting therefrom is likely to be something of a paradox.Judged scientifically, the individual is nothing but a unit which repeats itself ad infinitum and could just aswell be designated with a letter of the alphabet. For understanding, on the other hand, it is just the uniqueindividual human being who, when stripped of all those conformities and regularities so dear to the heart ofthe scientist, is the supreme and only real object of investigation. (Vol. 10, p. 251)Thus, we can see how Jung emphasize the different aims of science and of therapy ontwo accounts. As already discussed, Jung understands theoretical psychology and histype of therapy as finally leading to different types of understanding: theoreticalpsychology to the objective scientific knowledge of the logos and therapy to thesubjectively meaningful self-knowledge of the mythos. On the other hand, when Jungcontrasts knowledge and understanding this emphasizes what he sees as the limitationsof a general scientific knowledge in its application to the particular individual.But whereas if therapy eventually leads to a subjectively meaningful \"psychologicaltruth,\" we can readily agree that the therapist is involved in an enterprise with theindividual patient for which the term scientific is not entirely appropriate; it is lessclear that the mere particularity of the individual makes his understanding somethingbeyond the range of science. In his discussion of knowledge and understanding, Jungseems to overlook the possibility of any idiographic scientific methods, 24 and seems onthe whole to understand science in too narrow a way as only a study of universals.In fairness to Jung, however, the essential point of the distinction between knowledgeand understanding is to avoid the therapeutic attitude"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Page 108of seeing the patient only as a scientific problem. Moreover, the validity of this pointwould seem to hold independently of the question of nomothetic versus idiographicscientific methods. For Jung's \"understanding\" is not so much a question of seeing towhat degree the individual's behavior conforms to lawlike scientific expectations or isidiosyncratic, but rather of establishing the right therapeutic relationship with thepatient.But, at any rate, it is evident that what Jung is saying about the incommensurabilitybetween the theoretical and practical aspects of psychology can often seem to be simplythe adoption of an antiscientific attitude as in this example:Yet this is still \"psychology\" although no longer science; it is psychology in the wider meaning of theword, a psychological activity of a creative nature, in which creative fantasy is given prior place. (Vol. 6,p. 57)Jung is open here to the criticism of giving the false impression of holding to adichotomous division between theoretical and practical psychology, whereas, in reality,there is in fact a close interdependence and interrelation between the two aspects of hispsychological outlook. For the distinctive aspects of Jung's therapy are a direct productof his theoretical understanding (compare Jung's emphasis on the religious andmetaphysical needs of humankind with Freud's), and, on the other hand, Jung'spsychological system is to a large extent the end result of his pxperiences in workingwith patients.We can conclude, then, that there is a real basis in Jung's viewpoint for distinguishing ascientific level of discourse about archetypes from a level of personally meaningfulinterpretation. However, we must be aware of the danger of understanding thisdistinction between the two levels of discourse as a dichotomy between theoretical andpractical knowledge about archetypes, implying that what is learned in theory does nothave real application to the practical therapeutic needs of the individual, that therapygoes on completely independently of theoretical knowledge 25 On the other hand, toabandon the distinction altogether is tantamount to giving up the scientific perspectiveof objectivity with respect to the study of archetypes."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Page 1097Jung and the Scientific Attitude: Part2The Question of a Science of ArchetypesIntroductionOUR discussion of Jung's scientific attitude, the manner in which he understands histheory of archetypes to be scientific in principle, has led us to consider a distinctionbetween two kinds of discourse: one appropriate for scientific statements aboutarchetypes and one appropriate for statements on a personal, subjective level ofmeaning involving in many cases metaphysical and/or religious interpretations ofarchetypal experience. It is clear that Jung understands the distinction in terms oftheoretical versus practical knowledge, as he is involved on both levels as scientist andtherapist. Thus, sometimes Jung talks about his scientific views, and at other times hegives us practical, therapeutic advice or relates his personal, subjective understandingof the philosophical and religious implications of the archetypes.With some slight changes, we can accept Jung's distinction as a way of separatingscientific from extrascientific discourse about archetypes. We would phrase thedistinction as one between the facts of archetypal experience versus attitudes one takestoward these facts, how they are to be interpreted and assimilated to other frameworksof experience. This way of phrasing the distinction contrasts the scientific perspectiveon archetypes with the philosophical/religious interpretations of archetypal experiencethat often result from the exploration of individual archetypal images. 1 By means ofthis distinction we can show how considerations from the scientific point of view neednot be concerned with everything Jung says about archetypes.But if we can now begin to see how the claim of the archetypal theory to be ascientifically credible one is not invalidated by the different kinds of discourse we findin Jung's writings about archetypes, our task of examining Jung's scientific attitude inrelation to the question of the possibility of a scientifically defensible archetypal theoryis far from complete. For in order to show how the archetypal theory avoids being aninstance of a paradigmatically unscientific approach, we have still to"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Page 110discuss the problem of rationality in relation to the theory. This is the question of howthe archetypal theory can be shown to satisfy acceptable criteria of rationality for ascientific theory, the extent to which the theory can be shown to adequately reflect thelogos perspective.The Question of RationalityIt will be recalled that the question of rationality in relation to the archetypal theory wasoriginally raised in relation to the issue of mysticism (page 100). Although it wasconcluded that Jung's theory did not make an explicit appeal to a mystical framework ofunderstanding, them was nonetheless a question as to the nature of a similarity betweenJung's theory and a mystical approach. The question of such likeness was focused on theapparent similarity between the qualities of ineffability and paradoxicality that weresaid to characterize mystical experience and what Jung says about the paradoxicalnature of archetypal experience and its symbolic character which ''is never preciselydefined or fully explained.\" (Man and His Symbols, p. 4)But before proceeding to a discussion of the questions that came to light in thediscussion of mysticism, it would be well to consider the question of rationality from abroader perspective. For irrespective of any similarity that the archetypal theory mayhave with mysticism, the issue of rationality is a pivotal one in determining thescientific viability of an archetypal theory. For in view of the apparent difficulty inmaintaining an objective, theoretical discourse about archetypesevidenced by themixture of theoretical statements about archetypes and statements of an interpretivecharacter concerning how we should relate to archetypal experience that we find inJung's writingswe might well ask: Is a science of archetypes possible at all? One ofJung's followers, Gerhard Adler echoes the concern with this question in the followingpassale:Jung himself fought against the reproach of being a philosopher or metaphysician or even a mystic. Hefought against this criticism because he felt that he had elevated his approach to the status of true science;but perhaps, also, he was still caught in the idealisation of the scientist's image, represented by naturalscience, so rampant in the first half of the century. There are vast philosophical, metaphysical, and evenmystical aspects and implication in Jung's scientific researches and results,... 2Even Jung himself had moments of skepticism and doubt concerning whether irrationalphenomena like archetypes and dreams were subject matter for science:Indeed, I am persuaded that, in view of the tremendous irrationality and individuality of dreams, it may bealtogether outside the bounds of possibility to construct a popular theory. Why should we believe thateverything without exception is a fit subject for science?... It might be better to look upon dreams as beingmore in the nature of works of art"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Page 111instead of mere observational date for the scientist. (Vol. 17, pp. 163-164)Of course, scientific is a characteristic of a method of study rather than a subject matterper se. But in this regard we would naturally expect that some subjects lend themselvesmore easily to the methods of science than do others. Certainly psychology is one of themost difficult subject matters to study in a rigorous scientific way. Moreover, withinpsychology itself Jung's interests can be easily identified as subjects that are at least atthe very frontier of scientific endeavor, subjects that have either just begun to attractscientific attention or else have been given no previous scientific consideration at allSuch subjects as astrology, alchemy, UFO's, I Ching, and ESP are among Jung'sprofessional interests in addition to investigations into the delusional systems of theinsane and the worldwide literature of mysticism, mythology, and religions of all sorts.We might even chance a sweeping generalization and say that Jung's chief area ofinvestigation is the irrational in all of its multiform manifestations. Although such ageneralization perhaps stands in need of some qualification, it is easy to see how as anapproximate truth this fact of Jung's professional interest in the occult and the irrationalcould lead to the conclusion that there is a similarity between the subject matter and itsinvestigator. Jung addresses this problem in the following passage:If you call me an occultist because I am seriously investigating religious. mythological, folkloristic andphilosophical fantasies in modern individuals and ancient texts, then you are bound to diagnose Freud asa sexual pervert since he is doing likewise with sexual fantasies, and a psychologically inclinedcriminologist must needs be a gaol-bird....It is not my responsibility that alchemy is occult and mystical,and I am just as little guilty of the mystical delusions of the insane or the peculiar creeds of mankind.(Letters, Vol. 2, p. 186, letter to Calvin S. Hall dated 6 October 1954)Although this sort of identification between a subject matter and its investigator iseasily exposed as an error if taken as a necessary or universal type of relationship, itnonetheless contains an element of truth with respect to some individuals. For wewonder if there is not, as a matter of fact, some relationship between Freud'sprofessional preoccupation with sex and his own sexual problems, between his theory ofthe Oedipus complex and the facts of his own family history. As an analogous case,Jung had an abundance of first hand experience with the irrational that was the sourcefor at least part of the motivation for his researches as he confesses below.I was particularly satisfied with the fact that you clearly understand that I am not a mystic but an empiricist.It is true however that a vivid interest in religion and religious truth has guided my research. (Letters, Vol1, p. 237, letter to Norbert Drewitt dated 25 September 1937)"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Page 112When we consider, then, the fact of Jung's interest in the irrational in regard to thequestion of the possibility in principle of a science of archetypes, we can conclude onthe one hand that the irrationality of a subject matter should not disqualify it aslegitimate subject matter for scientific study, since a scientific statement about theirrational need not itself be an irrational statement. But, on the other hand, we mustacknowledge certain practical problems for scientific study that arise due to theirrational nature of archetypes. In this regard a major practical problem seems to be thedifficulty of maintaining a suitable scientific attitude of objectivity and detachment.This is reflected in the problem of the two kinds of discourse as we saw how Jungfrequently shifts from an objective, scientific discourse to a subjective, personallymeaningful type. This problem is also exemplified in the very close relationship thatexists between Jung's life and work. For it seems to be the case that archetypalexperience does not produce only objective scientific knowledge, but also a personalinvolvement. One does not only assimilate the archetypes to one's scientificunderstanding, but in a sense one's overall outlook becomes modified by the archetypes.One not only gains a scientific concept of the irrational, there is, at least in the idealcase, a coming to terms with the irrational forces inside oneself.From the therapeutic perspective, then, Jung can be seen to advocate the necessity fordirect involvement with the irrational forces experienced in the unconscious. Especiallyin regard to this perspective, we need to determine the theoretical justification for whatJung says about the irrational. Thus, we need to know whether what Jung says about theirrational can itself be justified by rational means. In this respect it is essential tounderstand what theoretical claims Jung is trying to defend in relation to the irrationaland in particular what he understands by thisterm.Jung's Treatment of the IrrationalWe find, then, that Jung closely associates the irrational with unconscious processes,whereas for him rationality is a correlate of consciousness:No matter how beautiful and perfect man may believe his reason to be, he can always be certain that it isonly one of the possible mental functions, and covers only that one side of the phenomenal world whichcorresponds to it But the irrational, that which is not agreeable to reason, rings it about on all sides. And theirrational is likewise a psychological functionin a word, it is the collective unconscious', whereas therational is essentially tied to the conscious mind. (Vol. 7, p. 71)To a large extent, then, the statements that Jung makes about the limits of reason andthe intellect for comprehending the totality of experience can be seen to be the result ofhis view that consciousness has a"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Page 113necessarily incomplete comprehension of the totality of the unconscious.There are several related reasons that Jung gives for the limitations of consciousness tofully comprehend the unconscious. The first has to do with the fact that knowledge ofthe unconscious necessarily is the product of its interaction with consciousness. Sinceconsciousness always mediates the experience of the unconscious, Jung argues thatthere is a sense in which we never know the unconscious itself, but only as it interactswith the more or less interfering medium of consciousness:Between the conscious and the unconscious there is a kind of \"uncertainty relationship,\" because theobserver is inseparable from the observed and always disturbs it by the act of observation. (Vol. 9-B, p.226)In the concluding chapter of Man and His Symbols, Marie-Louise von Franz elaboratesthis same argument:Each new content that comes up from the unconscious is altered in its basic nature by being partlyintegrated into the conscious mind of the observer. Even dream contents (if noticed at all) are in that waysemiconscious. And each enlargement of the observer's consciousness caused by dream interpretation hasagain an immeasurable repercussion and influence on the unconscious. 3As we have previously remarked on other occasions (see page 56), Jung likes to thinkabout the archetype per se in terms of Kant's concept of the thing-in-itself. Thus, hefrequently makes the move from asserting that there exists an uncertainty relationshipbetween conscious and unconscious to the statement that the ultimate nature of thearchetype per se is unknowable in principle as a thing-in-itself:In Mysterium Coniunctionis my psychology was at last given its place in reality and established upon itshistorical foundations.... The moment I touched bottom, I reached the bounds of scientific understanding,the transcendental, the nature of the archetype per se, concerning which no further scientific statements canbe made. (Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 221)A third reason for asserting the limitations of consciousness to completely comprehendthe unconscious is derived from the consideration that, as a matter of fact,consciousness is limited and finite in potential capacity, whereas the unconscious,although not infinite, contains a much larger relative store of content. Sinceconsciousness is only possible through a restriction of attention, this narrower scope ofconsciousness means, then, that consciousness cannot be aware of all aspects of theunconscious. Although this line of reasoning strictly shows that consciousness islimited only at any one time to what it can he aware of, it is Jung's"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Page 114claim that the overall potential capacity for consciousness is limited. Thus, our attemptsto make our actions and endeavors completely articulate and transparent toconsciousness will always fail, and the unconscious in all its manifestations can neverbe completely assimilated to a conscious awareness....even the most matter-of-fact contents of consciousness have a penumbra of uncertainty around themEven the most carefully defined philosophical or mathematical concept, which we are sure does notcontain more than we have put into it, is nevertheless more than we assume. (Man and His Symbols, p. 29)... Since we do not know everything, practically every experience, fact, or object contains somethingunknown. Hence, if we speak of the totality of an experience, the word \"totality\" can refer only to theconscious part of it. (Vol. 11, p. 41)The fact that the unconscious is never completely assimilated to consciousness meansthen that for Jung human existence always consists to a large extent of essentiallyirrational aspects, and that consciousness and rationality are always circumscribed bythe irrational and unconscious; the mythos element of experience can never bycompletely expunged:... the rational is counterbalanced by the irrational, and what is planned and purposed by what is. (Vol. 9-A, p. 94)That is, I do not believe that reason can be the supreme law of human behaviour, if only becauseexperience shows that in decisive moments behaviour is precisely not guided by reason but rather byoverpowering unconscious impulses. (Letters, Vol. 1, p. 402, letter to Pastor H. Wegmann dated 12December 1945)We have on the contrary good grounds for supposing that they [life and fate] are irrational, or rather that inthe last resort they are grounded beyond human reason. (Vol. 7, p. 49)But from the fact that Jung holds that human existence and reason do not mirror eachother perfectly, can we then conclude that at least certain aspects of experience liebeyond the grasp of reason altogether? Jung apparently thinks that this is the case. Forhe says that \"...there is a certain incommensurability between the mystery of existenceand human understanding.\" (Vol. 12, p. 212)Of course, it is just the archetypes of the collective unconscious that Jung has in mindas regards this \"mystery\":In these words Freud was expressing his conviction that the unconscious still harboured many things thatmight lend themselves to \"occult\" interpretation, as is in fact the case. These \"archaic vestiges,\" orarchetypal forms grounded on the instincts and giving expression to"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Page 115them have a numinous quality that sometimes arouses fear. They are ineradicable, for they represent theultimate foundations of the psyche itself. They cannot be grasped intellectually, [italics mine] and whenone has destroyed one manifestation of they they reappear in altered form (Vol. 10. p. 272)In order to determine Jung's position on the irrational, then, we need to get clear aboutprecisely what he means by \"incommensurability\" and \"cannot be graspedintellectually.\" Although it may seem that in this regard what Jung says about thearchetypes is very similar to mystical utterances, there is one sense in which what hemeans is vend mundane. For in pointing to an incommensurability between archetypalexperience and the understanding, part of what Jung wants to emphasize is theparticular quality of the lived experience of archetypes that is not adequately capturedby concepts.However, many experiences of an emotional nature have in common with archetypesthis feature of relative ineffability, that is, the feature of the relative inadequacy ofconcepts to express their lived quality. The particular emotive quality of a beautifulsunset, for example, is best expressed by a poem or a painting rather than by a conceptBecause of the numinosity of the archetypes, then, a concept of archetypes does notadequately convey their essential nature as experienced.However, considerations about the relationship between the experience of archetypesand the formulation of a theoretical understanding are not particularly crucial in regardto the question of the rationality of the archetypal theory. For Jung does not maintainthat an intuitive knowledge of archetypes based on their immediate experience is theonly sort of understanding of them which is possible Rather he maintains on the wholethat intuition is not sufficient for intellectual knowledge:The sale basis of real intellectual knowledge and moral understanding gets lost if one is content with thevague satisfaction of having understood by \"hunch.\" One can explain and know only if one has reducedintuitions to an exact knowledge of facts and their logical connections. (Man and His Symbols, p. 82)On the other hand, Jung frequently points out the inadequacy of an intellectualunderstanding as a substitute for the experience of confronting the unconscious and thearchetypes in a therapeutic context:It is precisely our experiences in psychology which desire as plainly as could be wished that the intellectual\"grasp of a psychological fact produces no more than a concept of it, and that a concept is no more than aname, a flatus vocis. (Vol. 9-B, p. 32)We can understand, then, that from the therapeutic perspective it is just the emotivequalities of archetypes and the particular problems of"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Page 116value and purpose in relation to the individual's life as brought into focus by archetypalexperience that are of utmost importance. Thus, much of what Jung has to say againstmason must be understood in a therapeutic context. In this respect it is a misuse ofreason rather than reason itself which is the object of vilification:...a relativation of rationalism is needed, but not an abandonment of mason, for the reasonable thing for usis to turn to the inner man and his vital needs. (Letters, Vol. 2, p. 286, letter to Eugen Böhler dated 8January 1956)The great difficulty seems to consist in the fact that on the one hand we must defend the sanity and logic ofthe human mind, and on the other hand we have to accept and to welcome the existence of illogical andirrational factors transcending our comprehension. (Letters, Vol. 2, p. 53, letter to Father Victor Whitedated 9 April 1952)It would seem evident that if all Jung has in mind by his \"cannot be grasped by theintellect\" is to emphasize the practical therapeutic aspects of working with thearchetypes on an experiential level, then the question of rationality need not beconsidered as a serious problem. However, in addition to the practical problems ofassimilating archetypes into one's experience on a personal basis, Jung apparently feelsthat the archetypes also pose particular problems for theoretical understanding. Thispoint is well exemplified in regard to the symbolic manifestations of archetypes:To the scientific mind, such phenomena as symbolic ideas are a nuisance because they cannot beformulated in a way that is satisfactory to intellect and logic. (Man and His Symbols, p. 80)It [symbol] has a wider \"unconscious\" aspect that is never precisely defined or fully explained. Nor canone hope to define or explain it. As the mind explores the symbol, it is led to ideas that lie beyond thegrasp of reason. (Man and HIS Symbols, p. 4)This metaphorical way of talking about what lies beyond the grasp of reason can bemade clearer as well as more plausible if instead of talking about what cannot begrasped or understood, we say that archetypal experience cannot be completelyrationalized. That is, the archetypes have a sort of cognitive autonomy that eludesattempts to completely reduce them to an unambiguous rational formulation. Anexample using the familiar phenomenon of dreams helps clarify this point.When we try to rationally understand a dream, we attempt an interpretation thattranslates the pictographic images of the dream into words. We encounter difficulties,however, because the dream images frequently fail to conform to rational expectationsof order and logic. Moreover, even with the most in-depth interpretation, we somehowfeel that something is lost in the transition from the dream images to words. in"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Page 117addition to the emotive content that is difficult to convey in words, it seems that thedream has its own way of cognitive expression which an interpretation does notcompletely capture. The dream images thus represent a certain gestalt of meaning thatoften resists translation into a linear sequence of ideas. We might say, then, that anylogos of the dream, any interpretive scheme, can never completely substitute for themythos perspective that the dream itself offers.Moreover, when we say that a dream or other manifestation of the unconscious cannotbe rationalized, what we previously discussed in terms of the inability of consciousnessto completely assimilate the unconscious must be borne in mind. Excepting Jung'sappeal to the Kantian doctrine of the thing-in-itself, then, the arguments we mentionedthere are additional reasons in support of this view.Our way of talking in terms of the inability of the unconscious to be completelyrationalized might seem to amount to the claim that a complete conscious reduction ofunconscious experiences is inadvisable. And the objection could be raised at the pointthat if this is what our claim amounts to, then it is not so much relevant to the questionof theoretical knowledge as to the problem of how best to deal with unconsciousexperience in a therapeutically beneficial way. From the theoretical perspective, itwould seem that it is just our task to try to make unconscious experience intelligible,that is, to rationalize it.However, in spite of Jung's unfortunate way of expressing himself in terms of what liesbeyond the grasp of reason, what he has in mind does apply to the theoretical knowledgeof archetypes. For it is his contention that we must make our theoretical statementsabout the archetypes reflect the actual nature of the phenomena. What we need to avoidin the problem of rationalizing the unconscious, then, is the reading in of more orderand logic than is really there. If we think of dreams in terms of their being onlyinformational static or noise in the brain, for example, an explanation satisfactory to therational need to account for such disturbing phenomena in a theoretically elegant way,we not only fail to derive practical benefit from them, but we also miss thedistinguishing feature of the phenomena, the fact that their cognitive content constitutesa meaningful message that can be shown to compensate the conscious attitude. Thus,Jung wants to argue that a conscious reduction of unconscious experiences isinadvisable, not only in terms of the practical situation of the individual dreamer, butalso from the standpoint of scientific methodology.The problem of the rational reduction of unconscious processes must also be kept inmind when we try to understand Jung's attitude toward the paradoxical. In regard to theparadoxical, then, we often find Jung associating the paradoxical and the metaphysical."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"For he says that metaphysical assertions can only be adequately formulated in anantinomian way:"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Page 118Every metaphysical judgment is necessarily antinomian, since it transcends experience and must thereforebe complemented by its counter-position. (Letters, Vol. 2, p. 254, letter to Pastor Jakob Amstutz dated 23May 1955)Thus, when we state a metaphysical truth in a paradoxical way, we express what Jungsees as its quality of unknowability:Paradox is a characteristic of the Gnostic writings. It does more justice to the unknowable than clarity cando, for uniformity of meaning robs the mystery of its darkness and sets it up as something that is known.(Vol. 11, p. 275)Paradox is a characteristic of all transcendental situations because it alone gives adequate expression totheir indescribable nature. (Vol. 9-B, p. 70)This use of paradoxical links the paradoxical with a metaphysical way of interpretingarchetypal experience In this regard there is a real similarity with the way in whichmystical experience is commonly interpreted. But irrespective of Jung's Kantian viewson the appropriateness of an antinomian expression for the metaphysical, it seems thatthere is no problem with rationality here since to say that archetypal experience isfrequently described in paradoxical terms is itself not a paradoxical statement.However, Jung also means not only that the ascription of paradoxical qualities toarchetypal experiences applies to the interpretation of the experience in metaphysicalterms, but also that it applies to a metaphysically neutral description. But in the latterregard when we say that archetypal experience is paradoxical, this amounts to arestatement of the considerations about the problem of rational reduction of archetypalexperience. For rather than an assertion that the experience cannot be described exceptby contradictory predicates, this weak sense of paradoxical implies only that we cannotpin down the experience and make it unambiguous, that is, it is open to differentinterpretations. This use of paradoxical is then not an assertion that the experiencetranscends logic altogether (the mystical sense of paradoxical), but only that it isinherently ambiguous. For example, the frequent archetypal symbol of the snakecombines both negative and positive qualities: \"Hence it is an excellent symbol for thetwo aspects of the unconscious: its cold and ruthless instinctuality, and its Sophiaquality or natural wisdom, which is embodied in the archetypes\" (Vol. 13, p. 333)Moreover, this ambiguity of the manifestations of the unconscious reflects for Jung thetension between the conscious and the unconscious attitudes. For symbols from theunconscious change their form in response to the conscious attitude (see page 59). Thesymbols are a reflection of this dynamic relationship between conscious andunconscious"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Page 119and thus often represent a synthesis of opposites; they are a bridge between mythos andlogos:And since the symbol derives as much from the conscious as from the unconscious, it is able to unite themboth, reconciling their conceptual polarity through its form and their emotional polarity through itsnuminosity. (Vol. 9-B, p. 180)What can we say then about the rationality of Jung's treatment of the archetypes? In thefirst place, it is obvious that Jung's sage statements about the unknowable are notsatisfactory, that is, we want to know on what grounds he can talk meaningfully of whatis unknowable. This sort of talk seems to imply a transhuman perspective from whichthe relationship between our ways of knowing and the world can be determined.However, as has been pointed out on other occasions, there is no necessity to followJung's Kantian line in order to rationally reconstruct the archetypal theory. And whenwe no longer think of the archetype per se as a thing-in-itself, many of Jung's leastrationally sounding statements need no longer concern us. For if we disregard Jung'sKantian views on the unknowable, what Jung says about the irrational seems to be bothreasonable and defensible on empirical grounds.If there is a genuine similarity here between mysticism and Jung's ideas, it is that bothconcur in the discovery of genuinely irrational aspects of experience. However, whereasthe mystic says that we have to accept this irrational given and abandon efforts tounderstand it rationally, it is always Jung's position that we must try to assimilate theirrational with our rational understanding as best we can. And although Jung's view thatthe rationality of consciousness as a matter of fact cannot completely assimilate andrationalize the unconscious may seem at first sight to be the very repudiation of themethodology of science, it is Jung's claim that far from deserting science hisphenomenological method of approach to the archetypes provides the key for a validobjective understanding of them as a logos that can fully acknowledge the reality of themythos.We need to examine this phenomenological method in order to see whether it in factqualifies as a valid and adequate scientific method.Jung's MethodologyIntroductionIn discussing the issue of Jung's methodology, it is important to understand whatsubstantive issues are at stake. In the first place, we are attempting to get clear about themethodological grounds for Jung's claim that his study of archetypes is a scientificenterprise. This question, moreover, must be considered in the context of the discussion"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"of the last section where the problem of the rationality of the archetypal theory was"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Page 120taken up. There it was emphasized that, although scientific statements about theirrational need not themselves be irrational, there are nonetheless special problemsinvolved in studying archetypes which from the theoretical perspective we described bytalking of the difficulty of accomplishing a rational reduction of archetypal experience,that is, the need to allow for a certain inherent ambiguity in the phenomena in order tocharacterize them properly. We need to discover, then, what actual consequences for thestudy of archetypes these considerations of the problem of the rational reductionproduce.The Problem of SubjectivityIf we inquire how Jung understands what he is doing, we discover that he asserts that hispsychological views fall within the domain of natural science, although science withcertain special limitations. ''Analytical psychology is fundamentally a natural science,but it is subject far more than any other science to the personal bias of the observer.\"(Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 200)The problem of subjectivity thus enters into psychology at the theoretical level. Junglikes to emphasize that this is due to the fact that in psychology we have noextrapsychological point of view from which to view the phenomena since allobservations are themselves psychological processes: \"... in contrast to any otherscientific theory, the object of psychological explanation is consubstantial with thesubject: one psychological process has to explain another.\" (Vol. 6, p. 494)Moreover, this difficulty with objectivity is, as previously discussed, especially relevantwith regard to the observation of unconscious processes. Jung quotes the physicistWolfgang Pauli on this point:\"'...this uncontrollable reactive effect of the observingsubject on the unconscious limits the objective character of the latter's reality and lendsit at the same time a certain subjectivity.'\" (Vol. 8, p. 229, note 130, no Pauli sourcegiven)For Jung this dilemma of subjectivity in psychology necessitates the toleration of aplurality of viewpoints. We must realize, then, that a psychological theory mirrors thepsychology of its formulatot. \"The assumption that only one psychology exists or onlyone fundamental psychological principle is an intolerable tyranny, a pseudo-scientificprejudice of the common man.\" (Vol. 6, p. 41)This point of the plurality of theories in psychology is developed in the context ofJung's theory of types. 4 He sometimes argues, therefore, that the necessity ofconsidering a plurality of theories must be taken to the extent of admitting one \"true\"theory for each type:"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"I believe that other equally \"true\" explanations of the psychic process can still be put forward, just as manyin fact as there are types. (Vol. 6, p. 493)"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Page 121For, besides his own theory, he would have to regard seven other theories of the same process as equallytrue, or, if that is saying too much, at least grant a second theory a value equal to his own.I am quite convinced that a natural process which is very largely independent of human psychology, andcan therefore be viewed only as an object can have but one true explanation. But I am equally convincedthat the explanation of a complex psychic process which cannot be objectively registered by any apparatusmust necessarily be only the one which that subjective process itself produces. (Vol. 6, pp. 490-491)In addition to the problem of the typological bias of an investigator making a truthclaim in psychology, Jung also states that we must be prepared to see these truth claimsas relative rather than absolute since, due to the polaristic nature of the psyche(conscious and unconscious attitudes do not coincide), we must be prepared to admit thereverse of our claim as also valid:Because psychology basically depends upon balanced opposites, no judgment can be considered to befinal in which its reversability has not been taken into account. (Man and His Symbols, p. 47)...we must observe the ride that a psychological proposition can only lay claim to significance if theobverse of its meaning can also be accepted as true. (Vol. 16, p. 115)Now if the above considerations are the sorts of things Jung has in mind as a way ofremedying the special problems with subjectivity in psychology, we might well wonderif the solutions are not as problematic as the difficulties for which they are to be thecorrective. However, Jung's statements about the relativity of truth in psychology andthe necessity for admitting the validity of a plurality of theories remain more or lesstheoretical, methodological ideals for Jung rather than actual practices he observes.In any case, these sorts of considerations are actually more relevant to problems ofpractical applications of theoretical reasoning in therapy than they are problems oftheory itself. For example, in practicing therapy Jung emphasizes that the therapist mustnever put the desire for theoretical confirmation of his pet theory above the need tounderstand the patient as an individual. Moreover, it is just in therapy that the potentialconflict of personalities as a result of differing personality types is most keenlyrelevant. Then, the need to consider questions from the standpoint of both the consciousand the unconscious attitudes comes to focus most clearly in regard to the working outof the individual's personal problems.To generalize, as Jung sometimes does on these points, from what is useful in therapy towhat is necessary for a theoretical psychological understanding in general is at best aquestionable move. it is always open to us, however, to accept the psychological facts ofsubjectivity that Jung"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Page 122points to without drawing the same conclusions for theoretical understanding inpsychology. That is, we can admit that there is a real problem with subjectivity withouthaving to concede that truth claims in psychology can only be considered valid relativeto individual personalities. 5We may consider the question of subjectivity in psychology, then, as a generalization ofthe problem of the rational reduction of archetypal experience.Jung's Phenomenological MethodIn regard to questions of methodology, if we can satisfactorily determine the allegedlyscientific method by which Jung studies archetypes, we need thus not be undulyconcerned if some of the things that Jung says about psychological methodology ingeneral seem to be problematic.We discover, then, that Jung recommends a phenomenological technique for thescientific study of archetypes. Here it is essential to understand what he means byphenomenology. The term connotes for him a theoretically unbiased observation ofphenomena. It is clear, moreover, that the Freudian technique of dream interpretation(see page 75) is the sort of unphenomenological, theory-biased construing ofunconscious phenomena to which Jung is opposed:Nevertheless, it cannot be maintained that the phenomenological point of view has made much headway.Theory still plays far too great a role, instead of being included in phenomenology as it should. EvenFreud, whose empirical attitude is beyond doubt, coupled his theory as a sine qua non with his method, asif psychic phenomena had to be viewed in a certain light in order to mean something. (Vol. 9-A, pp. 54-55)Here the interpretation must guard against making use of any other viewpoints that those manifestly givenby the content itself. if someone dreams of a lion, the correct interpretation can only lie in the direction ofthe lion;... (Vol. 17, p. 88)What this phenomenological method entails for Jung becomes more evident in thefollowing where, in response to a challenge that his study of archetypes is not groundedin a scientific method, Jung states his understanding of that method:I can entirely subscribe to your statement... \"Its (the scientific method's) tool is the objective observation ofphenomena. Then comes the classification of the phenomena and lastly the deriving of mutual relationsand sequences between the observed data, thereby mating it possible to predict future occurrences, which,in turn, must be tested by observation and experiment,\" if, I must add, the experiment is possible. (Letters,Vol. 2, p. 567, letter to K A. Bennet dated 23 June 1960)As may be expected, Jung's method of studying the archetypes does not employ anexperimental technique:"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Page 123Every science is descriptive at the point where it can no longer proceed tally, without on that accountceasing to be scientific (Vol. 9-A, pp. 55-56)Analytical psychology differs from experimental psychology in that it does not attempt to isolate individualfunctions (sense functions, emotional phenomena, thoughts, etc.) and then subject them to experimentalconditions for purposes of investigation. it is far more concerned with the total manifestation of the psycheas a natural phenomenona highly complex structure,...(Vol 17, pp. 91-92)Jung justifies his nonexperimental method of study by pointing out that as a medicalpsychologist he has to investigate the phenomena as they appear in his patients withoutbeing able to institute controls and manipulate variables. in Maslow's terms, Jung'spsychology is problem-entered rather than method-centered. 6...academic psychology...prefers to avoid complex situations by asking ever simpler questions, which itcan do with impunity. It has full freedom in the choice of questions it will put Nature.Medical psychology, on the other hand, is very far from being in this more or less emiable position. Herethe object puts the question and not the experimenter. The analyst is confronted with facts which are not ofhis choosing and which he probably never would choose if he were a free agent. (Vol. 10, p. 272)The difference between this and all earlier psychologies is that analytical psychology does not hesitate totackle even the most difficult and complicated processes. Another difference lies in our method ofprocedure.... Our laboratory is the world. Our tests are concerned with the actual, day-today happenings ofhuman life, and the test-subjects are our patients, relatives, friends, and, last but not least, (Vol 17, p. 92)But, if it is clear that the primary context of discovery for the archetypes is the clinicalsituation, it must not then be concluded that this is also the only context of validation.For when Jung uses the term phenomenological for his method of study, this should notbe understood to mean that it is entirely dependent upon introspective techniques. Theother term \"empirical\" that June employs for his method of study is then in somerespects more descriptive.Thus, Jung emphasizes the necessity of supplementing the findings derived from workwith patients by examining the manifestations of archetypes in a cross-cultural context.For when the same sorts of phenomena as appear in the clinical situation can be seen asexemplified in the art, literature, mythology, and religion of many different cultures,this gives the archetypes an extraclinical and publicly observable dimension. Jungtherefore likes to compare his method of study of archetypes to that of comparativeanatomy: \"My scientific methodology is nothing out of the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Page 124ordinary, it proceeds exactly like comparative anatomy, only it describes and comparespsychic figures.\" (Letters, Vol. 1, p. 360, letter to Pastor Max Frischknecht dated 7April 1945)The psychologist must depend therefore in the highest degree upon historical and literary parallels if hewishes to exclude at least the crudest errors in judgment. (Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 200)Symbolism has today assumed the proportions of a science and can no longer make do with more or lessfanciful sexual interpretations. Elsewhere I have attempted to put symbolism on the only possible scientificfoundation, namely that of comparative research. (Vol. 17, p. 106)The Problem of AmbiguityIn our discussion of Jung's scientific methodology, one chief question remains to beexplored. This question has to do with what Jung sees as the appropriate method ofcharacterizing archetypes. For if we understand that the phenomenological method triesto produce an accurate description of the archetypal phenomena that is as theoreticallyunbiased as possible, it seems evident Jung takes this to imply that his descriptions ofthe archetypes must mirror the phenomena described in the sense that they arethemselves ambiguous descriptions:I don't know whether I ought to be glad that my desperate attempts to do justice to the reality of the psycheare accounted \"ingenious ambiguity.\" At least it acknowledges my efforts to reflect, as best I can, the\"ingenious ambiguity\" of the psyche....The language I speak must be ambiguous, must have two meanings, in order to do justice to the dualaspect of our psychic nature. I strive quite consciously and deliberately for ambiguity of expression,because it is superior to unequivocalness and reflects the nature of life. (Letters, Vol. 2, pp. 69-70, letter toR. J. Zwi Werblowsky dated 17 June 1952)We must, however, distinguish here between two senses of ambiguous description. Onthe one hand, there are empirically accurate descriptions of ambiguity, and on the otherhand, there are ambiguous descriptions of ambiguous phenomena.But if Jung is all too often guilty of the latter type of ambiguity, this should notprejudice our attitude toward the genuine problem posed by the rational reduction. Forirrespective of Jung's individual style of talking about archetypes, a plausible case canstill be made for the necessity of having our descriptions of the archetypes take intoaccount their inherent ambiguity."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Page 1258The Study of Archetypes as a Scientific DisciplineIntroductionIN the previous two chapters we have considered the question of whether Jung holdsviews incompatible with those necessary for science, and also looked at themethodological basis upon which he claims that his study of archetypes is scientific.From these discussions what can be concluded concerning Jung's scientific views?In the first instance, it must be remarked that Jung's writings do not conform to anyexpectations we may have had concerning what constitutes ideal scientific writing.Moreover, this is due principally to the fact that the works are not uniformly scientifficin character. in this regard we have suggested that be separating the theoretical claimsJung makes for the archetypes from statements where Jung discusses attitudes towardsarchetypal experience, we could examine the question of scientific status independentlyof what Jung says of a philosophical and religious nature in his exploration of thesignificance of individual archetypes. But if such a distinction is successful in isolatingthe question of scientific status, this is not to say that we have then purified the theoryor arrived at its meaningful core, as if to imply that Jung should have done this himselfat the very beginning. Such an attitude only confuses the logic of reconstruction and theprocess of discovery. For if we admit that the extrascientific aspects of Jung'spersonality may at times dominate his writings as a whole, this is not in the end to thedisadvantage of scientific knowledge. For it is only through the wholeness of Jung'spersonality that we have such a theory that can then be examined in terms of scientificcriteria, that is to say, it is only through Jung's interest in and involvement with theirrational aspects of experience, both as an individual and a therapist.In regard to Jung's scientific views, then, our arguments so far have endeavored to showhow Jung in fact did attempt to construct a theory compatible with scientificunderstanding. Considering the highly irrational nature of the phenomena that are theobjects of such a theory, success in"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Page 126such an enterprise would most certainly entitle Jung to be regarded as a truly greatscientific pioneer and investigator.But did Jung succeed in formulating a theory that can be construed as a genuinelyscientific one? Instead of attempting to discuss necessary and sufficient criteria of whatis scientific in general, our approach to this question has been to examine possiblemasons on the basis of which the scientific label could be withheld from Jung's theory.Rather than attempting to show that Jung's theory is scientific because of its similarityto paradigmatic models of science such as physics and chemistry, we have attempted toestablish that it is not unscientific. This sort of approach allows for a liberalunderstanding of what constitutes a scientific theory. For rather than establishing apriori standards of what science must be, we instead examine the putative scientifictheory in regard to what it can accomplish toward a rigorous understanding of itssubject matter.But the sort of considerations we have discussed in regard to showing that Jung's theoryis not unscientific do not suffice to establish the scientific status of it. For if we havesuccessfully shown, for example, that the theory can be understood as a rational theory,and that religious and philosophical utterances often associated with it are not anecessary part of the theory itself, these are, for the most part, special problems of thearchetypal hypothesis. The resolution of these problems is thus necessary but notsufficient to show that the archetypal theory is not unscientific. There are otherconsiderations that must be examined before the scientific critic will rest content. Forwe still need to discuss the problem of falsifiability. In addition we need to show whatsorts of predictions the theory can make and what explanations result from it. Then weneed to look at the nature of the evidence claimed in support of the theory.With the examination of these remaining questions, the basis upon which we willadvocate scientific status for the archetypal theory will not be so liberal as to admitother disciplines such as astrology and numerology from which we would wish towithhold the scientific label. For these questions are just the sort of questions that anydiscipline must be capable of answering in a satisfactory way if it is to be included inthe domain of science.FalsifiabilityA preliminary topic that must be discussed in confronting the issue of falsifiability isthe problem of specifying the basis on which we claim that an archetype is present. Thequestion at stake here is brought into focus by the difficulties encountered by the non-Jungian in determining what observational states of affairs count as evidence for the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"presence of an archetype:The existence and working of the Jungian archetypes seems more difficult to demonstrate operationally:one can define objectively particular stimulus features or combinations of these, and can say whether or"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Page 127not they are present; but the Jungian archetypes have no clearly defined essential features by which theirpresence may be unequivocally established, and so many specific features are included as possiblemanifestations of one or another archetype that it is always possible to claim one is present. 1Moreover, Jungians themselves sometimes make statements that seem to indicate thatthey see archetypes in everything. The following statement from Jolande Jacobiindicates an attitude insensitive to the problem of falsifiability.And since all psychic life is absolutely grounded in archetypes, and since we can speak not only ofarchetypes, but equally well of archetypal situations, experiences, actions, feelings, insights, etc., anyhidebound limitation of the concept would only detract from its richness of meaning and implication.2Thus, in order to show that claims involving archetypes cannot be made compatiblewith all possible observational states of affairs, we must clearly indicate theobservational basis for the presence of archetypes.A clue to how we can go about meeting this difficulty is provided by fur reflection onthe problem of the individuation of archetypes. This is the problem of how to tell onearchetype from another. This problem is one manifestation of what we have called the\"problem of the rational reduction.\" For it seems that the archetypal phenomena do notreadily lend themselves to elation into unambiguous types:These unconscious nuclei are the archetypes and they can, up to a point, be classified and enumeratedthrough special imagesthe mythologemsbut these have a tendency to, as it were, dissolve into each other sothat they seem at one time to be numerous and at others to be a single entity.3When we speak of a problem of rational reduction, this is to indicate that the ambiguityis inherent to the phenomena rather than being a result of the inadequacy of theclassificational criteria. In this regard it is helpful to consider the analogous problem ofindividuating species or other biological groups such as phyla. When we consider, then,on what basis it is decided that in this instance you have two species whereas in anotherinstance only one, we do not expect from our taxonomist a definite decision procedurethat can be applied in all problematic cases. Rather the classification of species turns inthe end not so much on a priori criteria of speciation as on the reasonable judgment ofthe professional texonomist, subject to its acceptance by the professional taxonomiccommunity.The point of this analogy is to indicate that, when dealing with naturally occurringcomplex phenomena, precise operational definitions cannot be expected in regard to theclassification of the basic entities. Thus, there are"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Page 128no simple answers to the question of where to draw the line between one archetype andanother. But although it is unreasonable to expect a definitive decision procedure fordistinguishing archetypes, nonetheless discriminations can be carried out by theexperienced Jungian practitioner, although on analogy with biological speciation, thiswill not eliminate the element of conventionality and thus professional controversyconcerning the specification of particular archetypes. 4If we now consider the more general problem of the recognition of archetypes in regardto the difficulty of the non-Jungian in deciding what to call an archetype, the sort ofanswer we give is one couched in terms of lack of experience with the theory:To understand the peculiar phenomenon of the archetype one needs a lot of practical experience, f.i. thenuminous quality, so indispensable to the recognition of an archetype, is an indefinable imponderable likethe expression of the human eye, which is indubitable yet indescribable. (Letters, Vol. 2, p. 490, letter toStephen 1. Abrams dated 5 March 1959)But, of course, the claim that difficulties with the empirical interpretation of the theoryare due to lack of knowledge of the theory or lack of experience in applying it inspecific cases can easily be construed as a possible defense against all criticism of thetheory. For to say that only the person experienced with application of the theory reallyknows whether or not it applies in any specific case seems to work against thepossibility of there being critique of the theory from standpoints that do not alreadyassume it:In order to understand Jung, it has been said, one must experience his findings at first handhis work mustbe \"at least partially lived through and validated existentially, before it can be thoroughly grasped on aconscious level.\" [Ira Progoff, Jung's Psychology and Its Social Meaning (New York: Julian Press, 1953),p. ix] From the academic side, by contrast, comes the argument that a considerable amount of directcontact is likely to diminish objectivity. This, of course, is the old dilemma often set forth for depthpsychology in generaleither one remains outside and therefore insufficiently acquainted with the facts, orone moves inside and is cured of the desire to criticize.5However, although the practical difficulties with knowing how to apply the theory doseem in fact to lead to a situation in which only experts in the theory can determine forcertain how it applies in a specific case, this does not have the consequence of makingthe theory unfalsifiable or immune from the possibility of criticism. in order todemonstrate this point, it will be necessary to recapitulate the observational grounds forasserting the presence of archetypes.Recalling the discussion of this topic from chapter 3 (pages 57-58), it was stated thatthe chief difficulty in establishing the presence of"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Page 129archetypes was the fact that, although archetypes were postulated to be part of thecollective unconscious, the form of their manifestation in the individual always reflectsthe cultural and personal experiences of the individual. The problem of identifying thepresence of archetypes, then, is one of distinguishing the personal and collectivecontents. Moreover, what was distinctive of the collective, archetypal contents was theiralien character, that is, the fact that they appear in consciousness without the individualbeing able to account for them solely on the basis of his or her previous, personalexperience. But these are introspective and subjective features, and if the claim thatthere are archetypes just rested on these types of claims, the critic would be justified inpointing out the difficulties of establishing validation of introspective reports. Thisdifficulty would be accentuated by the fact that the reports are usually made by patientsin Jungian therapy. However, in addition to the subjective, introspective reports ofarchetypal experience, Jung points to the presence of the same motifs in the mythology,religion, art and literature of widely divergent cultures. A knowledge of cross-culturalsymbology is then brought to bear on the symbolic manifestations in the individual. Theclaim is that these cultural parallels help to explain the meaning and implications ofparticular symbolic manifestations in the individual in ways that cannot besatisfactorily accounted for solely by appeal to the person's individual development orprevious experiences. An example of how this method is used to elucidate the meaningof symbols by appeal to cultural parallels helps clarify this point:I can remember many cases of people who have consulted me because they were baffled by their owndreams or by their children's They were at a complete loss to understand the terms of the dreams. Thereason was that the dreams contained images that they could not relate to anything they could remember orcould have passed on to their children.I vividly recall the case of a professor who had had a sudden vision and thought he was insane. He came tosee me in a state of complete panic. I simply took a 400-year-old book from the shelf and showed him anold woodcut depicting his very vision \"There's no reason for you to believe that you're insane,\" I said tohim. \"They knew about your vision 400 years ago.\" Whereupon he sat down entirely deflated, but oncemore normal. (Man and His Symbols, p. 58)It should be evident, then, where the difficulty is encountered in knowing how to applythe theory. For if the non-Jungian has access to the same data as the Jungianpractitioner, he can be shown that there were nuministic symbolic images with cross-cultural parallels, and that in this sense there were archetypes, but he would be at a lossto say what archetypes he had been shown or what was their full meaning. In order todeal with the latter problems and employ the theory in a meaningful way, it is necessaryto gain a working knowledge of cross-cultural symbologies. This will entail, forexample, a knowledge of the motifs of worldwide"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Page 130mythologies and religions. From the standpoint of its empirical basis, then, it is easy tounderstand why the archetypal theory is frequently not given much seriousconsideration. For the archetypal skeptic often lacks either extensive experience withunconscious phenomena or else is unacquainted with the sort of cross-cultural parallelsthat Jungians claim as validation for the theory. 6But although confirmation of the archetypal theory would entail a certain amount oferudition, the validational basis of the theory, the cross-cultural parallels, is nonethelesspart of the public domain. Moreover, these de facto considerations concerning thepractical difficulty of gaining a working knowledge of the employment of the theory donot mean that the validity of the theory cannot be evaluated by the non-Jungian. Foralthough to understand how the theory works in a practical way involves specializedknowledge, the theory claims certain states of affairs that can be checked independentlyof a detailed knowledge of the manifestations of individual archetypes.For example, the theory claims that archetypal manifestations can be demonstrated inall races and civilizations of people without exception. What then will count as showingthat archetypes are not present in a group of humans? in this regard the ideal test casewould be a tribe that has not had previous cultural contact with other human groups.This is to guard against the possibility of the group having taken over symbols throughcontact with other cultures. To gather evidence against the archetypal theory, we have toshow that the group had no indigenous religious or mythological symbols. This wouldin effect involve showing that the group had no indigenous religious or mythologicalbeliefs.Other consequences that follow from the archetypal theory include the postulation ofbiological parallels to the archetypes in lower organisms. For since the archetypes areassumed to arise through the course of evolution, they must be prefigured in the otheranimals. Moreover, due to the close relationship that is postulated between thearchetypes and the instincts, this is an especially critical point since we would expectwhatever instinctual aspects there are in humankind to have homologies in the animalkingdom (see pages 45-48). If the efforts of the ethological school of animal behavior todemonstrate the existence of innate patterns of behavior can be shown to be misguided,then this will count against the archetypal theory.A third consequence that follows from the archetypal theory is the assertion thatarchetypes will be manifested in altered states of consciousness.7 Although this seemsto be a very vague claim, what it rules out is the situation where archetypes appear onlyin patients undergoing Jungian therapy or in individuals who have read Jung. in thisregard experimental results can be brought to bear for or against the theory. If"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"experimental techniques designed to produce altered states of consciousness uniformlydo not produce any sort of subject reports that describe phenomena"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Page 131similar to the Jungian description of archetypal experience, then this will be damningevidence against the theory.These three examples indicate what sort of evidence would count against the theory andthus what sorts of states of affairs are incompatible with it. 8ExplanationAlthough we cannot enter here into all aspects of the question of archetypalexplanation,9 one principal problem with explanation in the archetypal theory is that itdoes not seem possible in principle to predict when an archetype will be manifested norwhat its appearance will be like except within broad outlines:Although in human beings the archetype represents a collective and almost universal mode of action andreaction, its activity cannot as a rule be predicted; on never knows when an archetype will react, and whicharchetype it will be. (Vol. 18, pp. 657-658)As has been stressed in this book, there are no laws governing the specific from in which an archetypemight appear. There are only ''tendencies\" ... that, again, enable us to say only that such-and-such is likelyto happen in certain psychological situations.10However, it is not reasonable to expect laws depicting the relationship between thearchetype per se and the archetypal image. For the questions of when an archetypeappears, and what its manifestation will be like are answered in terms of the interactionbetween the innate archetype per se and the environment. The archetypal image is thenalways a product of these two factors interacting with each other in a dynamic way.This often leads to a state of affairs in which we explain a situation by appeal to thearchetypal theory that we could not have predicted. For example, Jung attempted toexplain the phenomenon of National Socialism on the basis of the activation of specificarchetypes in the German people.11 However, previous to the rise of Hitler and shortlythereafter, Jung was uncertain of what outcome would ensue from the possession of theGerman people by these archetypes.In regard to explanation, then, the archetypal theory is more like evolution theory thenNewtonian mechanics. For prediction on the basis of the principles of evolution, such asthe prediction that the fittest populations of organisms will survive, is always subject tounforseeable environmental circumstances. For example, what species survives mightbe due, as a matter of fact, to some environmental accident such as location proximateto the eruption of a volcano, which has no relation to the organisms' adaptation to theenvironment.12 Thus, the course of evolution cannot be predicted with certainty,although this does not mean that the theory of evolution is not explanatory."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Page 132In the archetypal theory, on the other hand, what is unforseeable that prohibits reliableprediction of the outcome of behavior of individuals or groups due to the activation ofarchetypes is exactly how a new archetypal manifestation will interrelate with theexisting cultural matrix. For example, we can explain the appeal of the cult of GuruMaharaj Ji, a teenage Indian who was celebrated as the Messiah by the Divine LightMission in India and the United States, on the basis of the projection of the Archetypeof the Divine Child. 13 When we attempt to determine why this particular archetype ismanifested in this particular form at this particular time in history, the answers we giveare in terms of the loss of numinosity of the traditional religious symbols and theconsequent appeal of symbolic forms from a non-Western culture that are differentenough to seem new and alive, yet similar enough to the old symbols to be easilyassimilated to the existing culture. However, due to the uniqueness and complexity ofthe factors that are involved in any particular time in history, this explanation of theappearance of a new manifestation of the archetype of the Divine Child is not sufficientfor us to make law like generalizations from which we could then expect exactpredictions.If we consider the situation in the individual rather than talking from a culturalperspective, the uncertainty that prohibits our knowing exactly when an archetype willappear and what its manifestation will be like is again due to the indeterminancy of therelationship between the innate archetype per se and environment. For the appearance ofarchetypes is conditioned by one's overall knowledge and experience.14Moreover, whereas from the cultural perspective the difficulty with predictingarchetypal manifestations is primarily due to the complexity and uniqueness of therelevant factors (here archetypal theory shares the same problems with historicalexplanation and prediction); with regard to the individual, there is the additional factorof an ethical issue. For in order to be able to separate the variables at work indetermining how environment conditions the appearance of archetypes in theindividual, we would need to perform an isolation experiment on a human being lastingseveral years.15In addition to the ethical problems with the isolation experiment, another reason thatcomplicates the problems with determining the appearance and manifestation ofarchetypes is the effect of the conscious attitude. For the degree to which the individualworks with the archetypes and attempts to understand their relationship to hispersonality affects how and when they appear to the individual. Moreover, it is evidentthat Jung's work in attempting to trace this relationship between the phenomenology ofarchetypes and the development of personality as encompassed by his theory of"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"individuation is very much pioneer work and that much additional study on this matterstill needs to be done.With regard to explanation and prediction with the archetypal theory, then, we mustconclude that two principal factors prohibit the theory from"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Page 133being able to accomplish feats of explanation and prediction similar to those of thephysical sciences. On the one hand, it is evident that the archetypal theory is animmature theory in the the sense that its full empirical implications have yet to beworked out. Moreover, in many respects the theoretical foundations of the theory arestill far from adequate. 16 To mention one example, the relationship which Jung has inmind between archetypes and instincts needs to be more precisely specified. It has beenone of the goals of this study to attempt to make some progress in the direction ofclarifying foundational questions, but it must be acknowledged that a great deal offurther work in this direction needs to be done before we could expect its acceptanceand widespread employment in such obviously applicable areas as anthropology.But, on the other hand, if we admit that the theory is an immature theory, this is not tosay that the theory is not scientifically defensible or that its methods are inadequate forwhat they attempt to accomplish. For the complex nature of the subject matter imposescertain definite limitations on what we could expect from even a foundationallyimpeccable archetypal theory whose empirical implications had been thoroughlyworked out. Especially with regard to explanation and prediction, then, we can hardlyexpect perfect knowledge in principle from an archetypal theory.17EvidenceThe archetypal image is postulated to be the end result of the interaction between theinnate archetype per se and the environment. But from the discussion in the last section,we saw that the archetypal theory does not attempt to specify precisely how these twofactors interrelate to produce the archetypal image. Thus, in the absence of anyarchetypal laws specifying how these two factors interact to produce the archetypalimages, the question arises as to how the innateness of the archetype per se is to beestablished. For if we are not in fact able to separate these two factors through sometype of isolation experiment, it might well seem that the claim that the archetypes areinnate, rather than acquired as a result of experiences in individual development, wouldbe on very weak ground. Moreover, if we cannot substantiate the innate nature of thearchetype per se, then the theory as a whole will lack a credible basis.In this regard it is instructive to consider in general the sort of evidence Jung gives insupport of his theory. in particular we need to examine how he attempts to establish thatthe archetypal images are due to innate factors.Jung argues, then, that the archetypal images are due to innate factors primarily on thebasis of paradigm cases in which it can be reasonably ascertained that the personsinvolved had had no previous exposure to the sort of motifs that appear in the dreams or"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"visions. Although from an"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Page 134ethical point of view, we cannot isolate the human subject from the possibility ofcultural influences; in some actual cases it is nevertheless possible to determine that thesubject could not have learned of the motifs. Naturally in most cases of allegedarchetypal manifestations, this degree of control will not be possible. For whenindividuals report that they cannot trace a specific image to something they haveacquired through learning, they may be either lying or mistaken. in the latter case thepossibility of cryptomnesia must always be kept in mind, that is, the possibility that thepersons have forgotten what they had previously learned which now appears as an aliencontent of consciousness without apparent connection with antecedent experience, whenin fact this connection has been simply forgotten. A third complicating factor is theelement of suggestion, where, instead of the images being spontaneously produced,their appearance is due to the suggestive influence of the investigator.Moreover, in order to establish that the content of the dream or vision is an archetype,in addition to establishing that it has not been acquired through previous experience, wemust also show that it has cultural parallels. However, in this regard the sort ofcorrelation that we need to establish between spontaneous products without previousexperiential antecedents and similar manifestations in cultural symbology is not onebetween images but rather one between motif. By emphasizing the similarity betweenmotifs rather than symbols per se, we role out the possibility that the similarity betweensymbols is due to chance or is a similarity with no significance. For in order to establishthat a symbol is a manifestation of an archetypal motif, rather than simply comparingthe similarity of isolated symbols, we must examine how the symbols function inrelation to their context:It does not, of course, suffice simply to connect a dream about a snake with the mythological occurrence ofsnakes, for who is to guarantee that the functional meaning of the snake in the dream is the same as in themythological setting? in order to draw a valid parallel, it is necessary to know the functional meaning ofthe individual symbol, and then to find out whether the apparently parallel mythological symbol has asimilar context and therefore the same functional meaning. (Vol. 9-A, p. 50)Thus, if we can show that a given content is not due to previous learning and has therequired cultural parallels, this is the sort of evidence that Jung gives in support of histheory of archetypes. Moreover, it is evident here that it is the first factor, thedemonstration that the spontaneous content had not been learned, that will be the mostdifficult aspect of the task of evidentially substantiating the archetypes.A paradigm case to which Jung refers most often in the latter regard involves the visionof a schizophrenic patient which Jung noted in 1906:"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Page 135One day I found the standing at the window, wagging his head and blinking into the sun. He told me to dothe same, lot then I would see something very interesting. when I asked his what he saw, he was astonishedthat I could see nothing, and said: \"Surely you see the sun's peniswhen I move my head to and fro, itmoves too, and that is where the wind comes from\" (Vol. 9-A, pp. 50-51)Jung, who at the time was not well-acquainted with the literature of mythology, did notknow what to make of the vision. However, four years later in a text describing a rite ofMithras he discovered an account that depicted the same motif:Draw breath from the rays, draw in three times as strongly as you can and you will feel yourself raised upand walking towards the height, and you will seem to be in the middle of the aerial region.... The path ofthe visible gods will appear through the disc of the sun, who is God my father. Likewise the so-called tube,the origin of the ministering wind. For you will see hanging down from the disc of the sun something thatlooks like a tube. And toward the regions westward it is as though there were an infinite east wind. But ifthe other wind should prevail towards the regions of the east, you will in like manner see the vision veeringin that direction. (Quoted from Albrecht Dieterich, Eine Mithrasliturgie [Leipzig, 1903 ], pp. 6ff.; Vol. 9-A,p. 51)The possibility of the patient having previously learned of this archetypal motif, \"theidea of a wind-tube connected with God or the sun,\" (Vol. 9-A, p. 52) is largely negatedby the fact that the passage that Jung cites as a parallel was only published in 1903,which was after the patient had been committed. Moreover, other incidences of this raremotif as depicted in medieval paintings were not in the local gallery Zurich where thepatient had lived his whole life. (Vol. 9-A, p. 52)Another example cited by Jung in Man and His Symbols involves archetypal dreammotifs reported by a ten-year-old girl:\"The evil animal,\" a snakelike monster with many horns, kills and devours all other animals. But Godcomes from the lout corners, being in fact lout separate gods, and gives rebirth to all the dead animal....A small mouse is penetrated by worms, snakes, fishes, and human beings. Thus the mouse becomeshuman. This portrays the four stages of the origin of mankind.A drop of water is seen, as it appears when looked at through a microscope. The girl sees that the drop iffull of tree branches. This portrays the origin of the world. (Man and His Symbols, p. 59)The first citation contains the motif of divine restitution, Apokatastasis, as well as themotif of a divine quaternity. The second and third citations illustrate the cosmogonicmyth depicting the origin of the world and human beings.

Moreover, it is never possiblewith absolute certainty to role out the possibility of deception and/or cryptomnesia, andJung's assurance is just about all the basis we have for judging the reliability of hissubjects and determining their lack of previous exposure to symbols from culturalsources.But within the context of his method of investigation, which is phenomenological ratherthan experimental, it is difficult to see how we could go beyond the sort of evidenceJung presents. With this type of approach, the best we could manage would seem to be alarger collection of similar paradigm cases. In regard to numbers of cases, Jung oftensays that he could easily multiply his examples, but hesitates to do so since each caserequires lengthy discussion in order to make clear the context out of which the symbolsare taken for comparison:Establishing such facts not only requires lengthy and wearisome researches, but is also an ungratefulsubject for demonstration. As the symbols must not be torn out of their context, one has to launch forthinto exhaustive descriptions, personal as well as symbological, and this is practically impossible in theframework of a lecture. (Vol. 9-A p. 50)In order to make clear what is meant by an archetypal motif, then, rather than giving asummary of its essential features, the best approach is to give examples of the motifwithin its various contexts of manifestation. This is illustrated when we try to give a listof archetypes. For without actual examples of how these archetypes function in a givencontext, such a list produces only a very superficial understanding of what an archetypalmotif involves. Moreover, in any case archetypal motifs are not easily divided intounambiguous, discrete types. These sorts of considerations, then, are reasons why Jungadheres to a descriptive, phenomenological method of investigation that yields evidenceof an essentially nonquantitative nature.However, the archetypal theory would rest on a very suspect empirical basis if the onlyevidence we had for the theory is the sorts of cases just discussed, which for the mostpart arise out of the context of therapeutic work done by Jungians. in order for thetheory to be credible at all, it must be shown to have consequences that are manifestedoutside of the Jungian therapeutic context.In this regard we can appeal to the commonality of symbolic motifs in culturesthroughout the world widely separated in space and time. However, although this typeof evidence is of an extraclinical and publicly observable nature, it has definitelimitations so far as constituting compelling evidence for the archetypal theory isconcerned. For it is even more difficult to establish the spontaneous origin of symbolic"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"motifs in cultures than it is in individuals, since the history and influences on theformer are more uncertain than for an individual. Moreover, appeal to cross-cultural"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Page 137similarities will not have much probative strength independently of the ability todemonstrate the emergence of these same archetypal motifs in individuals.Although we might expect that, irrespective of the difficulty of substantiating thespontaneous origin of symbolic motifs in various cultures, anthropological evidencewould nonetheless prove to be very helpful in establishing the credibility of the theory,this expectation has not been fulfilled for the most part. Due to the difficult nature ofthe theory in its practical application, anthropologists tend either to accept the theoryand to interpret their data from a Jungian perspective or else reject the theory from anunknowledgeable standpoint. in the latter case, it is difficult to determine the degree towhich their findings support the theory, since for the most part they are not sensitive towhat consititutes an archetype and are unaware of the diverse phenomenology of thevarious archetypal motifs. 18Due to the difficulties of evaluating the evidence for the archetypal theoryindependently of a Jungian framework of understanding, we earlier suggested thatreports from experiments designed to induce altered states of consciousness be studiedin order to see whether anything similar to descriptions of archetypal motifs werereported. If none were reported, then this would be strong evidence against the theory.On the other hand, however, the claim that there are such similar descriptions thatconstitute confirming evidence for the archetypal theory is rendered problematic by thefact that many of the investigators are influenced by Jung's work and thus readilyassume his theoretical viewpoint in interpreting their data. Moreover, in many of thestudies involving drugs, the element of suggestion was a relevant variable notcontrolled. (Both of these considerations apply to the Masters and Houston studydiscussed below.)But it is clear that this sort of research offers the promise of a solution to the problem ofextending the validational basis of the theory beyond the sort of evidence to which Jungoriginally appealed. For if no additional support for the theory is forthcoming besidesthe sort of data for which it was originally designed to explain, we would then have toconclude that the theory has very weak empirical support.One example of such evidence from altered states of consciousness research is reportedby R. E. L. Masters and Jean Houston in Varieties of Psychedelic Experience. Itinvolved work with the chemical substances LSD-25 and peyote and covers a period ofmore than fifteen years. A total of 206 drug sessions were involve.19The investigators reported that the perception of the guides in the experiment wasfrequently distorted in such a way that they were apparently seen as archetypal figures:"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"In a fairly common distortion the guide may be perceived by the subject as one or more of a variety ofarchetypal figures. For example, a"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Page 138female guide may be seen as a goddess, as a priestess, or as the personification of wisdom or truth orbeauty. Descriptions of some of these \"archetypal\" perceptions have included seeing the guide's features as\"glowing with a luminous pallor\" and her gestures being \"cosmic, yet classical.\" 20Moreover, in the course of the experiments, mythological and religious symbolicimagery was frequently encountered:In the psychedelic drug-state mythologies abound. The guide often may feel that he is bearing witness to amulti-layered complex of mythological systems as they arise out of their latency in the mind of thesubject.21The most frequently recurring mythic themes were summarized as follows:Myths of the Child-Hero, Myths of Creation, Myths of the Eternal Return (Cycles of Nature), Myths ofParadise and the Fall, Hero Myths, Goddess Myths, Myths of Incest and Parricide (Oedipus, Electra, etc.),Myths of Polarity (Light and Darkness, Order and Chaos), Myths of the Androgyne (Male-FemaleSynthesis), Myths of the Sacred Quest, Prometheus-Faust Myths (Myths of the Trickster).22Religious images of some kind were reported in ninety-six percent of the 206 subjects.These included images of religious figures: Christ, Buddha, saints, godly figures,William Blake-type figures (fifty-eight percent); devils and demons (forty-ninepercent); and angels (seven percent).23Despite the factors of the influence of Jung's work and the problem of suggestion, theseresults seem to constitute convincing evidence for the archetypal theory.Stanislav Grot, whose work involved LSD research conducted in Prague,Czechoslovakia, obtained results that support the Masters-Houston research. Forexample, he states:An important group of transpersonal experiences in LSD sessions are phenomena for which C. G. Jung hasused the terms primordial images, dominants of the collective unconscious, or archetypes. They repeatedlyoccur in sessions of both those subjects familiar with this concept and naïve individuals without anyprevious exposure to Jungian ideas.24Archetypes and Evolution TheoryIn considering the scientific status of the archetypal theory, it has been our concern todemonstrate that the theory as reconstructed is compatible in principle with acontemporary scientific understanding. in this regard, it is essential to establish that thetheory is not logically tied to an evolutionary theory that has been repudiated by modernbiologists,"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Page 139namely, one involving appeal to the inheritance of acquired characteristics.As we saw in chapter 3 (page 52), there was one point in rigs career where he postulatedthat the archetypes were inherited by means of such a mechanism and that archetypeswere the deposits of repeated experiences. (Vol. 7, p. 69) However, Jung retracted thisview and thereafter did not attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanism by whicharchetypes become part of the innate structure of the psyche except to say that thearchetypes were inherited as part of the structure of the brain and hence evolved ashumankind evolved.It is clear how the latter position can be construed as in principle compatible withDarwinian mechanisms of evolutionary change. However, although we can see how thissort of origin of archetypes through evolution is possible in principle, we might stillquestion whether the inheritance of such dispositions to produce symbolic images isplausible from the standpoint of modern evolutionary theory. In other words, is thereany reasoning from the biological point of view that can support the hypothesis thatsuch dispositions are in fact inherited?In this regard, the recent work of Edward O. Wilson and Charles Lumsden offers someinteresting research that seems to support the Jungian view. For Wilson argues thatthere is a coevolutionary link between mind and culture in which geneticallytransmitted epigenetic rules influence the direction in which culture develops 25 Cultureitself then acts as a selective pressure increasing the prevalence of the epigeneticfactors.The main import of Wilson's work consists in working out the genetic mechanisms bywhich complex social behavior patterns are influenced by hereditary factors. in his viewthis influence is generally manifested as an innately determined preference for thedevelopment of certain cultural forms over others. For example, there is a stronguniversal cultural bias against incest. Moreover, the deepest moral feelings are said tooriginate from epigenetically determined sources.26Wilson's views are similar to Noam Chomsky's arguments for the existence of an innatelanguage capacity that functions as an innate grammatical guide facilitating theacquisition of language by children.27 However, Wilson envisions a more generalinfluence in which many other forms of cultural activity are shaped by genetic factors.Although Wilson makes no references to Jung's view, when he states that \"... most or allforms of perception and thinking are biased by processes in the brain that aregenetically programed,\"28 this falls right in line with the archetypal theory.Even if Wilson's work is open to question and we could not precisely specify the sort of"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"genetic mechanisms that were responsible for the inheritance of the kind of dispositionswhat Jung postulates, this lack of knowledge would not by itself cast doubts on thetheory, since the genetic mechanisms that are responsible for many aspects of humannature are as"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Page 140yet, to say the least, imperfectly understood.But if it can be shown how a structure enables an individual to be better adapted to theenvironment in such a manner as to produce relatively more progeny than anotherindividual lacking the structure, then it is reasonable to suppose from the standpoint ofmodern evolutionary theory that whatever genes are responsible for the structure willtend to increase in the overall population of the species. Showing that dispositions toproduce numinous symbolic images have probably been inherited is then reducible tothe problem of showing the basis in terms of which it is reasonable to believe that thesedispositions did in fact confer a selective advantage on those humans or predecessors ofhumans who happened to have the necessary genes to produce them.In this regard we point to the fact that humankind is not a solitary species but evolvedas a social animal. Thus, it is not difficult to see how the survival of humankind as aspecies has been enhanced by mechanisms that facilitate social cooperation such as thedevelopment of a shared culture. Moreover, it is easy to understand how the religious ormythological heritage of a human society gives it unity and stability and how \"Theintegration of the social group, its cohesion, is maintained by the direction of certainsentiments toward a symbolic center.\" 29If we admit that religious and mythological symbolic systems have survival value inthat they enhance social cooperation within the human community, the likelihood thatdispositions that tend to produce symbolic manifestations will be selected for in thecourse of evolution would seem to be very great. The perspective of modern evolutiontheory is thus one which supports the prospect of there being innate dispositions toproduce numinous symbolic images such as the archetypal theory assumes.30"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Page 141NotesIntroduction1.

Sheldrake proposes that in addition to the materialand energetic processes that science studies, physical and biological systems are also inpart regulated by invisible organizing fields lacking mass and energy called\"morphogenetic fields.\" These fields are patterns reinforced by repetition of events overtime. Whenever an animal learns a new behavior, for example, this alters themorphogenetic field that helps regulate the behavior of that animal. If sufficientanimals learn the behavior, then learning in new animals takes progressively less time.Thus, Sheldrake's morphogenetic field hypothesis supports the thesis of the existence ofa real collective memory within species.21.

Although Jung did deal with what he took to be parapsychological aspects ofarchetypal experience, such as in his theory of synchronicity, the archetypal phenomenafor the most part are not as anomalous in relationship to conventional frarneworks ofknowledge as are psychic phenomena.1. Jung's Mental Constructs1. As will become evident as our exposition proceeds, Jung means psyche to be richer inconnotation than the term mind in its ordinary usage. Moreover, it is just the features ofthe collective unconscious which contribute this additional meaning to the psyche.2. The term \"libido\" is used extensively in Jung's earlier work and reflects the influenceof Freud. Jung did not employ the term much in his later writings (from 1935 onward)"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"although his psychology continued to view the psyche on the model of energeticprocesses and to speak of psychic energy.3.

It is not in the passage where he speaks of Bergson that this is made clear but in theessay \"On Psychic Energy,\" Vol. 8, pp. 3-66 where the implications of the libido theorywith respect to the problem of the mind-body relation are discussed in detail.5. By double aspect theory is meant the view that the mental and physical are differentaspects of some third entity that is itself neither mental nor physical. By panpsychism isunderstood the view that the mental and physical are related in such a way that theseattributes always occur as integral parts of each other rather than there being mattercompletely devoid of mind or completely immaterial mind.6. See pages 25-27 for more discussion of psychoid processes. The theory ofsynchronicity is discussed on pages 64-66. The so-called synchronistic events discussedbelow involve meaningful but acausal coincidences between psychic contents andphysical events. For example, a clock stops at the moment of the owner's death.7. Perhaps it can yet be shown how the occurrences of synchronicity, ESP, out-of-bodyexperiences, and even survival of bodily death can be explained within theinteractionistpanpsychist double aspect view that we have claimed as Jung's basictheory of mind. For as we have previously remarked, Jung's theoretical model of thepsyche is capable of being able to accommodate in principle at least some of theseextraordinary phenomena. However, the point is that Jung in trying to account for theseevents did not always do so within the context of the theory of mind be employs in thegreat majority of his writing. For he at times talks of parallelism and implies a positionof substantial dualism that would require a radically different theory of mind than thatupon which his psychology as a whole is based.8. Strictly speaking, the archetypes are completely incapable of being made consciousin the sense that what appears in consciousness is never the archetype per se but only anarchetypal image. This distinction between the archetype per se and the archetypalimage is further discussed on pages 55-57.When archetypes come into consciousness, they limit the will by means of theirnuminosity, a sort of fascination (see pages 43-44). Thus, the individual's will isoften caught up in the spell of the archetype so that, for example, the man in lovebecomes enthralled by the archetype of the anima as embodied in his object ofaffection.9.

In addition to being a bridge between the and and the physiological, the psychoidelements in their spiritual aspect, that is, the archetypes, are also postulated toconstitute an interface between psyche and matter in the context of the theory ofsynchronicity where parallel events are hypothesized in physical nature and inpsychological meaning (see pages 20-21 and 65). However, since in line with ourprogram of naturalistic reconstruction we are setting apart the synchronicity hypothesisfrom the archetypal theory as we reconstruct it, we will consider the psychoid elementsonly from the point of view of the physiologicalPage 145interface, not as indication of the possibility of the psyche operating in physicalnature.11. Concerning the two quotes that seem to indicate racial, ethnic, and geographicdifferentiations in the collective unconscious, Jung states that he wrote the first in 1927.(Vo1. 10, p. 544) The second was apparently written in 1916 as it appears in the 1916version of the \"Structure of the Unconsicious.\" (Vol. 7, p. 275) Both of these passagesare, however, retained in the version of Two Essays on Analytical Psychology revised in1942.12. Jung sometimes carries his argument for the existence of essential psychologicaldifferences in distinct racial, ethnic, and geographic groups to what would seem to beindefensible extremes. For example he writes in 1934: \"I must confess my totalinability to understand why it should be a crime to speak of 'Jewish' psychology.\" (Vol.10, p. 541)Jung also states that Eastern yoga should not be practiced by Westerners since itcannot be assumed that the Westerner's psyche can assimilate without possible harma practice that evolved out of the cultural tradition of the East:\"In the East, where these ideas and practices originated, and where anuninterrupted tradition extending over some four thousand years has created thenecessary spiritual conditions, yoga is, as I can readily believe, the perfect andappropriate method of fusing body and mind together so that they form a unitythat can hardly be doubted....He [the European] will infallibly make a wrong use of yoga because his psychicdisposition is quite different from that of the Oriental. I say to whomsoever I can:'Study yogayou will learn an infinte amount from itbut do not try to apply it, forwe Europeans are not so constituted that we apply these methods cerrectly, justlike that.'\" (Vol. 11, pp. 533-534)Jung's social and political views have been the subject of widespread"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"misunderstanding due in no small measure to Jung's notorious political ineptness.For an unbiased account of Jung's social-political views and his unfortunateadventures in public affairs, see Aniela Jaffé's From the Life and Work of C.

The issue of whether or not the collective unconscious is a superindividual entityseems to be dependent to some extent on whether it is considered from a mythos or alogos point of view. From the mythos perspective there is only one collectiveunconscious and it is everywhere and timeless. But from the standpoint ofconsciousness, from which science and the logos have to proceed, there aremanifestations of the collective unconscious in every person. From the logosperspective the idea that the collective unconscious is a superindividual entity is ahypostatization, it is only a theoretical construct rather than being an actual thing in itsown right Jung's facile passage from a logos to a mythos discourse about archetypeseasily confuses the issue here. it is clear, however, that in his later work, from about1940 onward, Jung came to suspect that there might be some literal oneness to thecollective unconscious as evidenced by various parapsychological events of which hewas attempting to take cognizance in his psychological views. The rationale for takingthe naturalistic reconstructive tack of separating thesePage 146speculations from the main body of Jung's theory is that it saves the archetypaltheory from speculative and metaphysical implications that unnecessarily cloud themain empirical grounds on which the theory as a whole is based.2. Theory of Archetypes: Part 11. This dream was provided by a friend, George Clough.2. \"Dismemberment is a practically universal motif of primitive shamanisticpsychology. It forms the main experience in the initiation of a shaman.\" (Vol. 13, p. 70,note 4) \"Dismemberment can be understood psychologically as a transformativeprocess which divides up an original unconscious content for purposes of consciousassimilation. Or, put another way, it is original unity submitting to dispersal andmultiplicity lot the sake of realization in spatio-temporal existence.\" (Edward F.Edinger, Ego and Archetype: Indivivduation and the Religious Function of the Psyche[Baltimore: Penguin, 1972], p. 140.)3. In calling the archetypes \"dispositions\" we do not mean to imply that they areintervening variables rather than hypothetical constructs. (Compare KennethMacCorquodale and Paul E. Meehl, \"On a Distinction Between Hypothetical Constructsand Intervening Variables,\" Psychological Review 55 [March 1948]: 95-107).

When welater call the archetypes organizing and structuring principles (pages 56-57), wemean to refer to this same dispositional quality of the archetype per se.4. The fact that Kant had a strong influence on the development of Jung's ideas is amplyevidenced by the many explicit references to Kant scattered throughout Jung's works.Moreover, when Jung talks of the philosophers who had been important to hisintellectual development, we again find him acknowledging the influence of Kant: \"Thephilosophical influence that has prevailed in my education dates from Plato, Kant,Schopenhauer, Ed. v. Hartmann, and Nietzsche. These names at least characterize mymain studies in philosophy.\" (Letters, Vol. 2, pp. 500-501, letter to Joseph E Rychlakdated 27 April 1959)In his autobiography Jung describes an interest in Kantian philosophy that was partof a \"philosophical development\" that \"extended from my seventeenth year until wellinto the period of my medical studies.\" (C. G. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections,recorded and ed. Aniela Jaffé, trans. Richard and Clara Winston [New York: RandomHouse, 1963], p. 70. Hereafter cited as Memories, Dreams, Reflections.) The extentof that interest is revealed when Jung relates that while a medical student \"Theclinical semesters that followed kept me so busy that scarcely any time remained formy forays into outlying fields. I was able to study Kant only on Sundays.\"(Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 101)"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Page 1475. Jolande Jacobi, Complex/Archetype/Symbol in the Psychology of C. G.

By the transpersonal nature of the archetype is meant that the experience seems torefer to something beyond the individual's own ago and personal boundaries, and thatthe experience is not completely explicable by reference to the individual's pastexperience or development.3. Theory of Archetypes: Part 21. As will become apparent as we proceed, this hope will not be fulfilled. It is only inJung's earlier writing that he attempts to explain how archetypes originate through ideasabout the origins of myths. However, due to the fact that Jung's views on this matterbecome implicated with ideas about the inheritance of acquired characteristics, thisearlier view merits full discussion.Also, at least one commentator on Jung has advanced the idea that the origin ofmyths and archetypes are causally interrelated. In Jung, Gods, and Modem ManAntonio Moreno states:\"In spite of Jung's explanation, the relation of myth and archetypes is not yetclear. it is the myth which forms the archetype, and at the same time, it is thearchetype which produces mythical ideas. Is it a vicious circle? Not likely,because for Jung, the subjective fantasies of myths are the causes of archetypes.But once the archetype is formed, it is endowed with a kind of readiness the samemythical ideas which were the cause of its formation, a familiar psychologicalprocess. Habits and dispositions are formed in the same way; repetition of acts thehabit, but once the habit exists it is inclined to produce the very acts that were thecause of its existence:...\" (Antonio Moreno, Jung, Gods, and Modern Man [NotreDame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1970], p. 19.)2. in the above we have not distinguished the spiritual from the religious, as in theprevious discussion of the spiritual when the latter term referred to the archetypalmanifestation and \"religious\" to the product of collective consciousness. Jung does notalways use these terms in a consistent way, although from the context it is usually clearwhether he is referring to the individual or the collective manifestation.3. However, it is easy to fall into the opposite error of seeing alchemy solely as a"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"philosophico-relig ous enterprise and thus fail to appreciate the important role thatalchemical work has played in the history of chemistry. Jung, in his work with thepsychological significance of alchemical symbols, is particularly open to the criticismthat he has overemphasized the psychological aspect of alchemy while failing to givedue credit to the naturalistic and practical aspects of the art.4. The term \"mechanicomorphize\" is taken from Joseph F. Rychlak, APage 148Philosophy of Science for Personality Theory (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1968), p.57. \"it is also possible to take the opposite approach, [to anthropomorphism] andassign non-human characteristics to human organisms. Some psychologists feel thatthe behaviorist does this when he 'mechanicomorphizes' man (Allport, 1940).\"5. Richard Semon, The Mneme, trans. Louis Simon (New York: MacMillan, 1921), pp.11-12.6. Ibid., p. 12.7. In addition to natural phenomena, Jung also discusses psychological andphysiological processes as causative factors in the generation of myths. (Vol. 8, pp.155-156)The change in Jung's position concerning the origin of archetypes occurred sometimearound the year 1930.8. Issues surrounding the relationship between evolution theory and archetypes arefurther discussed on pages 66-68 and 138-140.9. James Hillman's perspective on archetypes rejects the archetype per se/archetypalimage distinction. Hillman takes the image as ultimate and is not interested intheoretical points of view that seek to explain the multiform archetypal images in termsof any underlying causes. See chapter 5 for a full discussion of the Hillman position onarchetypes.10. The problem of the individuation of archetypes is further discussed on pages 63 and127-128. Here the issue is briefly taken up in the context of the problem of the relationbetween archetype per se and archetypal image. On page 63 the question is consideredfrom the perspective of a discussion of the phenomenology of the chief archetypes. Onpages 127-128 the question of the individuation of archetypes is discussed with theintent of showing how in the absence of a definite decision procedure for individuatingarchetypes, such questions as what to count as an archetype and how to talk in ameaningful way about different archetypes, can nonetheless be operationally decided bythose sufficiently acquainted with the theory."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"11.

The application of the Kantian phenomena/noumena distinction to the problem ofarchetype per se versus archetypal image is not unproblematic. For the appeal to thearchetype per se as the principle responsible for the archetypal image would seem toimply the attribution of qualities to the thing-in-itself, that is, that the latter was realand had certain effects. Thus, if we take the archetype per se as strictly analogous to thething-in-itself, we end up attributing properties to that, which from Kant's viewpoint,we are not supposed to be able to attribute anything at all. See Edward Casey's article\"Toward An Archetypal Imagination,\" Spring (1974): 29, note 9.13. We are using the work \"extraspection\" in the sense ascribed to it by Joseph F.Rychlak in A Philosophy of Science for Personality Theory, p. 27: \"If the theoristPage 149takes an extraspective perspective or frame of reference, he defines his abstractionsfrom his vantage point as observer, regardless of the point of view of the object ofstudy.\"14. In this portion of a dream of Jung's, for example, the shadow archetype appears as\"Dr. Y. and his son.\" Moreover, the image of Jung's father also plays an archetypal rolein the dream. In contrast to the relationship Jung had with his real father, this symbolicfather acts as a guide to the mysteries of the unconscious:\"It started with my paying a visit to my long-deceased father. He was living in thecountryI did not know where. I saw a house in the style of the eighteenth century,very roomy, with several rather large outbuildings.... My father guarded these ascustodian.He was, as I soon discovered, not only the custodian but also a distinguishedscholar in his own rightwhich he had never been in his lifetime. I met him in hisstudy, and, oddly enough, Dr. Y.who was about my ageand his son, bothpsychiatrists, were also present. I do not know whether I had asked a question orwhether my father wanted to explain something of his own accord, but in any easehe fetched a big Bible down from a shell, a heavy folio volume like the MerianBible in my library. The Bible my lather held was bound in shiny fishskin. Heopened it at the Old TestamentI guessed that he turned to the Pentateuchand beganinterpreting a certain passage. He did this so swiftly and so learnedly that I couldnot follow him. I noted only that what he said betrayed a vast amount ofvariegated knowledge, the significance of which I dimly apprehended but couldnot properly judge or grasp. I saw that Dr. Y. understood nothing at all, and hisson began to langh. They thought that my father was going off the deep end and"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"what he said was simply senile prattle....The two psychiatrists represented a limited medical point of view which, ofcourse, also infects me as a physician. They represent my shadowfirst and secondeditions of the shadow, father and son.\" (Memories, Dreams, Reflections, pp. 217-218)15. In talking in this way about the insight of a universal perspective, there is atemptation to speak in terms of the \"wisdom\" of the unconscious. In regard to collectivecompensation, then, we must he careful to avoid the misunderstanding that this type oflanguage implies that the unconscious is a sort of higher consciousness that purposivelyguides the personality to its destination. For the sort of \"guidance\" which theunconscious provides is that which results from the working of a natural process thatitself has no end in view. Jung makes this point in a discussion concerningcompensation by the unconscious:\"Yet it would, in my view, he wrong to suppose that in such eases the unconsciousis working to a deliberate and concerted plan and is striving to realize certaincleave ends. I have found nothing to support this assumption. The driving force,so far as it is possible for us to grasp it, seems to he in essence only an urgetowards self-realization. If it were a matter of some generalPage 150teleological plan, then all individuals who enjoy a surplus of unconsciousnesswould necessarily be driven towards higher consciousness by an irresistible urge.\"(Vol. 7, p. 184)16. The anima is in part a man's inner image of women. See page 62-63 for furthercharacterization of the anima archetype.17. Although the content of all the archetypes is conditioned by the individual'spersonal experience, the shadow and the anima/animus differ from the other archetypesin the tact that their content is more directly related to the individual's personalsituation than the other archetypes. in terms of the analogy of depth, then, thesearchetypes occupy a position intermediate between consciousness and the personalunconscious and the other aspects of the collective unconscious.18. See Ira Progoff, Jung, Synchronicity, and Human Destiny, p. 106.Since causation has been ruled out, the question might well be raised how the\"influence\" of the archetype can then be made intelligible. It would seem that somesort of law like ordering principle must be postulated not involving a cause andeffect relationship between the objective event and the correlated internal state ofexpectancy. Making clear how the archetype is supposed to function as this ordering"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"principle is one of the major conceptual ambiguities that must be resolved in order tomake synchronicity into a truly explanatory hypothesis.19. Since the position taken here is that a rational reconstruction of the archetypaltheory is not committed to the task of a rational reconstruction of synchronicity, we willnot attempt a critical assessment of synchronicity in this study. In order to carry outthat task, several key questions would have to be considered. in addition to the problemof making archetypal \"influence\" intelligible, additional clarification is neededconcerning how the crucial distinction between coincidence and meaningfulcoincidence can be made operationally sound.20. Stevens speculates that the archetypes are located in the midbrain and brain stem:\"Moreover, there is now good reason to suppose that the 'command neurones'subserving archetypal systems may be situated in the phylogenetically ancientcerebral regions of the midbrain and brain stem,...\" (Anthony Stevens,Archetypes: A Natural History of the Self [New York: Quill, 1982]: p. 274.)Even if Rupert Sheldrake is correct in his theory of morphic resonance (see page 143,note 20), this would not mean that new archetypes suddenly spring into being withnew learning. For the archetypes would still be subject to the sort of genetic stabilitydemonstrated in the basic genetic structure of species that breed true for generationsin spite of new environmental conditions. For example, finches trapped on theGalapagos Islands and sent to California showed innate fear responses to hawks theysaw in California even though there had been no predator birds on the islands, andthe finches had thus not been exposed to the sight of a predator bird for hundreds ofthousands of years since this innate response first evolved.

Critiques of the Theory of Archetypes1. As the interpretation of Jung's archetypes as occult or supernatural agencies is notattributed to any particular author in the following, it should be mentioned that this lineof interpretation is one which is very popular with uncritical Jungian enthusiasts whoare eager to embrace doctrines which, from their point of view, representsensationalistic alternatives to a scientific world-view.2. Jung's analytical inclinations and abilities at times fail to keep pace with the flood ofinsights and ideas born the unconscious. His expositions frequently become so involvedwith lengthy examples and parenthetical elaborations that the main thread of discussionis lost. Vol. 5 of the Collected Works, Symbols of Transformation, is a good example ofthis overdetermination of content at the expense of form.3. Gerhard Adler, Letter to the Editor, Horizon 19 (June 1949): 454.4. See Philip Rieff, The Triumph of the Therapeutic: Uses of Faith After Freud (NewYork: Harper and Row, 1966), p. 41 where this terminology is used.5. Philip Rieff, \"C. G. Jung's Confession: Psychology as a Language of Faith,\"Encounter 22 (May 1964): 49.6. Edward Glover, Freud or Jung? (Cleveland: Meridian, 1956), p. 33.7. As might be expected, what we have called \"criticisms based on misunderstanding\"could also conceivably be fitted into this second category of systematically biasedcritiques. Although it is not clear what ideological motives Rieff may have, Glover isobviously a Freudian defending the faith. But as many of Glover's criticisms cannot beunderstood solely in terms of a Freudian interpretation of the psychological phenomena,they have no value for determining whether an alternative hypothesis can account forthe objects of Jungian theoretical interest. Thus some, but not all, of Glover's objectionsto Jung's ideas can be relegated to the first category.Page 152The examples of systematically biased critiques to be discussed below are frompsychoanalysis and Judeo-Christian theology.8. One could conceivably criticize Jung's archetypal hypothesis from other standpointsthan those mentioned here. One could well imagine a behaviorist critique, for example.However, an examination of such a critique would not shed much light on archetypaltheory. A more fruitful discussion would be one drawn from the standpoint of anexistentialist critique. Although the phenomenologists and existentialists do not for themost part address themselves to Jung's concept of the collective unconscious, it might"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"well be thought that their attempt to frame their ideas without appeal to a concept of anunconscious would constitute a strong implicit repudiation of Jung's viewpoint. Butsuch thinkers as Husseri, Heidegger, Sartre, and Medard Boss, although they claim todescribe human experience without the need for an unconscious, have in actualitysmuggled it back into their views with functionally equivalent concepts. For example,in Heidegger's work the concepts of \"horizon\" and \"thrownness\" seem to be functionallyequivalent to what Jung means by the unconscious.9. Glover, p. 35.10. Ibid., p. 38.11.

It is borrowed from William James, Pragmatism (1907), p. 16: 'Whatis higher is explained by what is lower and treated for ever as a case of \"nothingbut\"nothing but something else of a quite inferior sort.'\" (Letters, Vol. 1, p. 142,note 1)31. From the Kantian point of view, it might be objected that a Kantian interpretation ofthe archetypes is still possible even if we do not identify the archetype per se with thething-in-itself. For it is possible to think of both the archetypal image and the archetypeper se as part of the phenomenal realm and as distinct from the noumenal archetypalreferent. In keeping with the intent of Jung's line of reasoning on this matter, we couldthen state that what is said about the God archetype does not necessarily implicate uswith claims about God as noumena.32.

We have deferred the discussion of these questions concerning the issue ofrationality until the next chapter in order to first explore the question of the relationbetween scientific and extrascientific discourse about archetypes.19. Erich Neumann seems to doing this is his book The Origins and History ofConsciousness, trans R. F C Hull (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1954) wherehe is apparently engaging in speculative mythology while giving the appearance of anempirical study.

The present section is only a preview of the full argument we want to make insupport of the idea that Jung did view his theory of archetypes in a perspectiveappropriate for the designation of the label \"scientific.\" The rest of the present chapterand chapter 7 support this position.21. We are using these terms in the sense in which Rychlak characterizes them:\"Nomothetic study essentially presumes that a theoretical abstraction can be madewhich has general applicability for several members of a given class (i.e.,distribution). ldiographic study, on the other hand, emphasizes the uniqueness ofpersonality manifestation.\" (Rychlak, p. 24)Thus, there are two distinct issues involved in discussing the basis for the tensionbetwen a scientific level of discourse about archetypes versus a personal, therapeuticlevel. The issue of an incommensurability in principle between theory and practice,and the issue of nomothetic versus idiographic methods for understanding theindividual. As will become clear, Jung does not really distinguish between these twoquestions, but equates idiographic with the therapeutic and extrascientific. We intend"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"to show how Jung's distinction between the two levels of discourse is defensible onthe basis of the first issue. With respect to the second issue, we do not intend to fullyexplore the question of the relative merits of nomothetic versus idiographic methodsfor studying the individual.

Thus, althoughwhat Jung says about the value of an idiographic approach to the individual makessense within the therapeutic context, Jung fails to point out how the idiographicapproach does not have to be identified with the alms of practical psychology, butcan also be defended as a legitimate scientific method in its own right."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Page 15722.

Gordon W. Allport, Personality and Social Encounter(Bostorn: Beacon Press, 1960), p. 12.It seems that in this regard we have a discrepancy between what Jung says and whathe actually does. For the in-depth study of individual cases is in fact characteristic ofhis work. The massive volume Symbols of Transformation (Vol. 5) is primarily anextended commentary centered around the material of one schizophrenic individual.(The person was not a patient of Jung's.)25. Thus, when we distinguish a scientific level of discourse from a level of personallymeaningful interpretation, questions can still be raised concerning the scientificjustification of what is advocated for therapy. For we wish our theorectical knowledgeto rule out some therapeutic practices even if we admit that scientific knowledge is notitself sufficient for therapeutic success as determined by the individual's gain in self-knowledge and self-realization.7. Jung and the Scientific Attitude: Part 21. Jung's distinction between theoretical and practical knowledge of archetypes is onethat is aptly expressed in terms of object and meta-levels of archetypal experience.However, often Jung can be seen to generalize from personal and therapeutic experiencewith archetypes and to relate his views on what is beneficial for man in general. In thisway, a great deal of philosophizing does in fact appear in Jung's writings. Because ofthis philosophical perspective in Jung's work, our modified distinction will be in termsof kinds of discourse rather than levels.2.

In fairness to Jung, it must be pointed out that Jung is usually sensitive to adistinction between theoretical and practical knowledge as outlined in the sectionPage 158on science and the individual. However, as exemplified in the passages cited here,Jung sometimes is guilty of not distinguishing between the practical requirementsfor applying a theory in therapy and requirements for the acceptance of a theoreticalclaim.6. \"...many psychologists who choose to work as best they can with important problems(problem-centering) rather than restricting themselves to doing only that which theycan do elegantly with the techniques already available (method-centering).\" AbrahamH.

Avis M. Dry, The Psychology of Jung: A Critical Interpretation (New York: JohnWiley and Sons, 1961), p. xiii.6. In regard to the operational difficulty of employing the archetypal theory, the work ofH. Yehezkel Kluger has to be mentioned. Kluger developed a rating scale fordiscriminating between archetypal and nonarchetypal dreams. In order for a dream to becounted as archetypal, it must have three out of four of the following characteristics:"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"\"a) A parallel to a mythological motif (under which term are included also motifsfrom fairy-tales, folklore, and religious symbolism).b) Heightened affect.c) Remoteness from everyday experience.d) Non-rational imagery or behavior.\" (H.

Each of the four Kluger categorieswas given a number scale. For example, mythological parallels were rated to be distant,moderate, or loose. Irrationality was rated from rational-notPage 159unlikely, rational-possible, rational-unlikely, borderline-nonrational butcomprehensible, irrational (impossible in reality), bizarre. Them was a highcorrelation between the overall rating score indicating the presence of archetypalcontent in the author's rating and that of another rater.7. By experiments with altered states of consciousness, we have in mind such things asdream research, work with hypnosis, biofeedback meditation, sensory deprivation, andpsychedelic drugs.We do not mean to imply here that archetypes can only be manifested in alteredstates of consciousness. Presumably the archetypes influence consciousness in all ofits states. However, analogously to other aspects of the unconscious, the archetypesare most noticeable when consciousness is intefered with in some way, as under theinfluence of drugs, or if there is a relaxation of conscious attention, as in hypnosis ordreams.8. But this is not to say, of course, that there are no possible ad hoc modifications Whatwould save the theory from contrary evidence in these cases. For in addition to the factWhat we must not underestmate the ingenuity of theorists, theories are not in any casesimply overthrown by single incidences of contrary evidence. However, in the casescited, it is very difficult to see what sort of ad hoc modifications could be invoked Whatwould not invoice a radical revision of the theory itseft.9.

Michael Scriven, \"Explanation and Prediction in Evolutionary Theory,\" in Man andNature: Phitosophical Issues in Biology, ed. Ronald Munson (New York: Dell, 1971),pp. 213-227.13. See Jung, \"The Psychology of the Child Archetype,\" in Vol. 9-A. The sort of motifat work here is roughly the same as that which is involved in the story of the Christchild, that is, miraculous origins followed by heroic childhood deeds.14. This, then, is one reason why persons who have experience experience with Jung'swork dream Jungian dreams. The theoretical knowledge of Jung is an additional aspectof one's overall understanding in terms of which the appearance of the archetypalmanifestations are conditioned:\"There are people who can read my books and never have a dream of anythingreminiscent of my writings, but it is true that if you understand what you haveread, you get a frame of mind or a problematical outlook which you did not havebefore, and that, of course, influences your dreams.\" (Letters, Vol. 2, p. 187, letterto a young Greek girl dated 14 October 1954)15. The sort of experimental problems we have in mind with regard to an isolationexperiment would be similar to those encountered in ethological studiesPage 160designed to investigate innate behavior patterns. See Konrad Lorenz, Evolution andModification of Behavior (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1965).With regard to archetypes, two separate questions are at stake. On the one hand, wewould want to know whether archetypal images were manifested at all underconditions of isolation; and, on the other hand, we could investigate the relationshipbetween selected environmental stimuli such as television or a particular literatureand archetypal appearance.16. Jung is the first to admit that his work is of a pioneer nature and thus often withoutadequate theoretical foundations:\"However, as you have rightly seen, I have landed myself in enormous difficultiesby framing general formulations which are intended to explain the whole field ofhuman experience. I had to keep to experiences that were directly accessible tome and compare them with data drawn from the whole history of the mind. This"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"gives rise to some degree of inexactitude which makes my efforts appearprovisional. it is perfectly clear to me that everything I do is pioneer work whichhas still to be followed by a real laying of foundations, but there are gratifyingsigns that others are beginning to make forays into this territory.\" (Letters, Vol. 1,pp. 231-232, letter to Rudolf Pannwitz dated 27 March 1937)17. By perfect knowledge is meant a situation in which a symmetry exists betweenexplanation and prediction such that every adequate explanation is also a potentialprediction. Compare Carl G. Hempel, Aspects of Scientific Explanation: And OtherEssays in the Philosophy of Science (New York: Macmillan, 1965), p. 364.18. It might seem that these considerations indicate that one must assume thearchetypal theory in order to be able to see what counts as data in favor of it. However,this difficulty of appraising the evidence for the archetypal theory from a non-Jungianperspective exemplifies the close interrelationship that exists between theory andevidence. That is to say, the theory determines which data are relevant as evidence andwhat is relevant as evidence from one theoretical perspective is irrelevant from another.The fact that Jung employs a phenomenological method of investigation does not ofcourse mean that he does not select what is relevant for description from essentiallytheoretical considerations.19.

Of course, the archetypal theory is not the only possible explanation of howreligious and mythological symbolic systems come into being. When the point aboutthe survival value of religions and mythologies is admitted, this only entails theinheritance of dispositions to produce symbolic images rather than the full archetypaltheory. One might wish to argue, for example, that all that was necessary for suchsystems to come into being is language and imagination. However, it would seem thatthe archetypal theory with its hypothesis of the innate archetypes offers a theory ofdispositions to produce numinous images that goes a long way toward explaining theculturally universal similarity and emotional appeal of religious and mythologicalmotifs, whereas this additional explanatory import is lacking with other ideas of howsymbolic ideas might have originated."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Page 163BibliographyAdler, Gerhard. \"Analytical Psychology and the Principle of Complementarity.\" In TheAnalytic Process: Aims, Analysis, Training: The Proceedings of the FourthInternational Congress for Analytical Psychology, pp. 110-121.
