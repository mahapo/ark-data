The church won’trelease oɽcial membership ɹgures, but informally it claims 8 million membersworldwide, a ɹgure that is based on the number of people who have donated tothe church. A recent ad claims that the church welcomes 4.4 million new peopleevery year. And yet, according to a former spokesperson for the church, theInternational Association of Scientologists, an organization that church membersare forcefully encouraged to join, has only about 30,000 members. The largestconcentration, about 5,000, is in Los Angeles. A survey of American religiousaɽliations compiled in the Statistical Abstract of the United States estimates thatonly 25,000 Americans actually call themselves Scientologists. That’s less thanhalf the number identifying themselves as Rastafarians.Despite decades of declining membership and intermittent scandals that mighthave sunk other faiths, Scientology remains aɻoat, more than a quarter centuryafter the death of its chimerical leader, L. Ron Hubbard. In part, its survival isdue to colossal ɹnancial resources—about $1 billion in liquid assets, accordingto knowledgeable former members. Strictly in terms of cash reserves, that ɹgureeclipses the holdings of most major world religions. Scientology’s wealthtestiɹes to the avidity of its membership, relentless fund-raising, and the legacyof Hubbard’s copyrights to the thousand books and articles he published.The church also claims about 12 million square feet of property around theworld. Hollywood is the center of Scientology’s real-estate empire, with twenty-six properties valued at $400 million. The most recent addition to the church’sHollywood portfolio is a television studio on Sunset Boulevard formerly ownedby KCET, acquired in order to open a Scientology broadcasting center. InClearwater, Florida, where Scientology maintains its spiritual headquarters, thechurch owns sixty-eight largely tax-exempt parcels of land, valued at $168million. They include apartment buildings, hotels and motels, warehouses,schools, oɽce buildings, a bank, and tracts of vacant land. The church oftenacquires landmark buildings near key locations, such as Music Row in Nashville,Dupont Circle in Washington, DC, and Times Square in New York City. A similarstrategy governs the placement of Scientology’s holdings in other countries.Typically, these buildings are magniɹcently restored architectural treasures,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"lavishly appointed, even if the membership is negligible. The church owns aɹve-hundred-acre compound in Southern California and a cruise ship, theFreewinds, which is based in the Caribbean. The Church of Spiritual Technology,the branch of Scientology that owns the trademarks and copyrights to all churchmaterials, including Hubbard’s immense body of popular ɹction, maintainssecret bases in several remote locations in at least three American states, wherethe founder’s works are stored in titanium canisters in nuclear-blast-resistantcaverns. One of the vault locations, in Trementina, New Mexico, has an airstripand two giant interlocking circles carved into the desert ɻoor—a landmark forUFOs, some believe, or for Hubbard’s reincarnated spirit, when he chooses toreturn.There are really three tiers of Scientologists. Public Scientologists constitutethe majority of the membership. Many of them have their ɹrst exposure to thereligion at a subway station or a shopping mall where they might take a free“stress test” or a personality inventory called “The Oxford Capacity Analysis”(there is no actual connection to Oxford University). On those occasions,potential recruits are likely to be told that they have problems that Scientologycan resolve, and they are steered to a local church or mission for courses ortherapy, which the church terms “auditing.” That’s as far as most new membersgo, but others begin a lengthy and expensive climb up the church’s spiritualladder.The mystique that surrounds the religion is owed mainly to the second tier ofmembership: a small number of Hollywood actors and other celebrities. Topromote the idea that Scientology is a unique refuge for spiritually hungrymovie stars, as well as a kind of factory for stardom, the church operatesCelebrity Centres in Hollywood and several other entertainment hubs. AnyScientologist can take courses at Celebrity Centres; it’s part of the lure, that anordinary member can envision being in classes with notable actors or musicians.In practice, the real celebrities have their own private entry and course rooms,and they rarely mix with the public—except for major contributors who areaccorded the same heightened status. The total number of celebrities in thechurch is impossible to calculate, both because the term itself is so elastic andbecause some well-known personalities who have taken courses or auditingdon’t wish to have their association known.An ordinary public Scientologist can be inconspicuous. No one really needs toknow his beliefs. Public members who quit the church seldom make a scene;they just quietly remove themselves and the community closes the circle behindthem (although they are likely to be pursued by mail and phone solicitations for"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the rest of their lives). Celebrity members, on the other hand, are constantlybeing pressed to add their names to petitions, being showcased at workshopsand galas, or having their photos posted over the logo “I’m a Scientologist.”Their fame greatly magniɹes the inɻuence of the church. They are deployed toadvance the social agendas of the organization, including attacks on psychiatryand the pharmaceutical industry, and the promotion of Hubbard’s contestedtheories of education and drug rehabilitation. They become tied to Scientology’sbanner, which makes it more diɽcult to break away if they should becomedisillusioned.Neither the public nor the celebrity tiers of Scientology could exist withoutthe third level of membership—the church’s clergy, called the Sea Organization,or Sea Org, in Scientology jargon. It is an artifact of the private navy thatHubbard commanded during a decade when he was running the church while onthe high seas. The church has said on various occasions that the Sea Org has5,000, 6,000, or 10,000 members worldwide. Former Sea Org members estimatethe actual size of the clergy to be between 3,000 and 5,000, concentrated mainlyin Clearwater, Florida, and Los Angeles. Many of them joined the Sea Org aschildren. They have sacriɹced their education and are impoverished by theirservice. As a symbol of their unswerving dedication to the promotion ofHubbard’s principles, they have signed contracts for a billion years of service—only a brief moment in the eternal scheme, as seen by Scientology, whichpostulates that the universe is four quadrillion years old.The church disputes the testimony of many of the sources I’ve spoken to forthis book, especially those former members of the Sea Org who have now leftthe organization, calling them “apostates” and “defectors.” It is certainly truethat a number of them no longer accept the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard; butmany still consider themselves fervent Scientologists, saying that it was thechurch itself that has strayed from his example. They include some of thehighest officials who have ever served in the organization.Scientology is certainly among the most stigmatized religions in the world,owing to its eccentric cosmology, its vindictive behavior toward critics anddefectors, and the damage it has inɻicted on families that have been brokenapart by the church’s policy of “disconnection”—the imposed isolation of churchmembers from people who stand in the way of their longed-for spiritualprogress. In the United States, constitutional guarantees of religious libertyprotect the church from actions that might otherwise be considered abusive or inviolation of laws in human traɽcking or labor standards. Many of thesepractices are well known to the public."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"And yet curious recruits continue to be attracted to the religion, though not inthe numbers that Scientology claims; celebrities still ɹnd their way to thechurch’s VIP lounge; and young people sign away the next billion years of theirexistence to an organization that promises to work them mercilessly forpractically no pay. Obviously, there is an enduring appeal that survives thewidespread assumption that Scientology is a cult and a fraud.I have spent much of my career examining the eʃects of religious beliefs onpeople’s lives—historically, a far more profound inɻuence on society andindividuals than politics, which is the substance of so much journalism. I wasdrawn to write this book by the questions that many people have aboutScientology: What is it that makes the religion alluring? What do its adherentsget out of it? How can seemingly rational people subscribe to beliefs that othersɹnd incomprehensible? Why do popular personalities associate themselves witha faith that is likely to create a kind of public relations martyrdom? Thesequestions are not unique to Scientology, but they certainly underscore theconversation. In attempting to answer them in this book, I hope we can learnsomething about what might be called the process of belief. Few Scientologistshave had a conversion experience—a sudden, radical reorientation of one’s life;more common is a gradual, wholehearted acceptance of propositions that mighthave been regarded as unacceptable or absurd at the outset, as well as theincremental surrender of will on the part of people who have been promisedenhanced power and authority. One can see by this example the motor thatpropels all great social movements, for good or ill.LAWRENCE WRIGHTAustin, Texas"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"L1The Convertondon, Ontario, is a middling manufacturing town halfway betweenToronto and Detroit, once known for its cigars and breweries. In a tributeto its famous namesake, London has its own Covent Garden, PiccadillyStreet, and even a Thames River that forks around the modest, economicallystressed downtown. The city, which sits in a humid basin, is remarked upon forits unpleasant weather. Summers are unusually hot, winters brutally cold, thesprings and falls ɹne but ɻeeting. The most notable native son was thebandleader Guy Lombardo, who was honored in a local museum, until it closedfor lack of visitors. London was a diɽcult place for an artist looking to ɹndhimself.Paul Haggis was twenty-one years old in 1975. He was walking toward arecord store in downtown London when he encountered a fast-talking, long-haired young man with piercing eyes standing on the corner of Dundas andWaterloo Streets. There was something keen and strangely adamant in hismanner. His name was Jim Logan. He pressed a book into Haggis’s hands. “Youhave a mind,” Logan said. “This is the owner’s manual.” Then he demanded,“Give me two dollars.”The book was Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, by L. RonHubbard, which was published in 1950. By the time Logan pushed it on Haggis,the book had sold more than two million copies throughout the world. Haggisopened the book and saw a page stamped with the words “Church ofScientology.”“Take me there,” he said to Logan.At the time, there were only a handful of Scientologists in the entire provinceof Ontario. By coincidence, Haggis had heard about the organization a couple ofmonths earlier, from a friend who had called it a cult. That interested Haggis; heconsidered the possibility of doing a documentary ɹlm about it. When hearrived at the church’s quarters in London, it certainly didn’t look like a cult—two young men occupying a hole-in-the-wall oɽce above Woolworth’s ɹve-and-dime.As an atheist, Haggis was wary of being dragged into a formal belief system."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In response to his skepticism, Logan showed him a passage by Hubbard thatread: “What is true is what is true for you. No one has any right to force data onyou and command you to believe it or else. If it is not true for you, it isn’t true.Think your own way through things, accept what is true for you, discard therest. There is nothing unhappier than one who tries to live in a chaos of lies.”These words resonated with Haggis.Although he didn’t realize it, Haggis was being drawn into the church througha classic, four-step “dissemination drill” that recruiters are carefully trained tofollow. The ɹrst step is to make contact, as Jim Logan did with Haggis in 1975.The second step is to disarm any antagonism the individual may display towardScientology. Once that’s done, the task is to “find the ruin”—that is, the problemmost on the mind of the potential recruit. For Paul, it was a turbulent romance.The fourth step is to convince the subject that Scientology has the answer. “Oncethe person is aware of the ruin, you bring about an understanding thatScientology can handle the condition,” Hubbard writes. “It’s at the right momenton this step that one ... directs him to the service that will best handle what heneeds handled.” At that point, the potential recruit has oɽcially beentransformed into a Scientologist.Paul responded to every step in an almost ideal manner. He and his girlfriendtook a course together and, shortly thereafter, became Hubbard QualiɹedScientologists, one of the ɹrst levels in what the church calls the Bridge to TotalFreedom.HAGGIS WAS BORN in 1953, the oldest of three children. His father, Ted, ran aconstruction company specializing in roadwork—mostly laying asphalt andpouring sidewalks, curbs, and gutters. He called his company Global, because hewas serving both London and Paris—another Ontario community ɹfty miles tothe east. As Ted was getting his business started, the family lived in a smallhouse in the predominantly white town. The Haggises were one of the fewCatholic families in a Protestant neighborhood, which led to occasionalconfrontations, including a schoolyard ɹstɹght that left Paul with a broken nose.Although he didn’t really think of himself as religious, he identiɹed with being aminority; however, his mother, Mary insisted on sending Paul and his twoyounger sisters, Kathy and Jo, to Mass every Sunday. One day, she spotted theirpriest driving an expensive car. “God wants me to have a Cadillac,” the priestexplained. Mary responded, “Then God doesn’t want us in your churchanymore.” Paul admired his mother’s stand; he knew how much her religion"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"meant to her. After that, the family stopped going to Mass, but the childrencontinued in Catholic schools.Ted’s construction business prospered to the point that he was able to buy amuch larger house on eighteen acres of rolling land outside of town. There werea couple of horses in the stable, a Chrysler station wagon in the garage, andgiant construction vehicles parked in the yard, like grazing dinosaurs. Paul spenta lot of time alone. He could walk the mile to catch the school bus and not seeanyone along the way. His chores were to clean the horse stalls and the dog runs(Ted raised spaniels for ɹeld trials). At home, Paul made himself the center ofattention—“the apple of his mother’s eye,” his father recalled—but he wasmischievous and full of pranks. “He got the strap when he was ɹve years old,”Ted said.When Paul was about thirteen, he was taken to say farewell to his grandfatheron his deathbed. The old man had been a janitor in a bowling alley, having ɻedEngland because of some mysterious scandal. He seemed to recognize a similardangerous quality in Paul. His parting words to him were, “I’ve wasted my life.Don’t waste yours.”In high school, Paul began steering toward trouble. His worried parents senthim to Ridley College, a boarding school in St. Catharines, Ontario, near NiagaraFalls, where he was required to be a part of the cadet corps of the RoyalCanadian Army. He despised marching or any regulated behavior, and soonbegan skipping the compulsory drills. He would sit in his room readingRamparts, the radical magazine that chronicled the social revolutions thenunfolding in America, where he longed to be. He was constantly gettingpunished for his infractions, until he taught himself to pick locks; then he couldsneak into the prefect’s oɽce and mark oʃ his demerits. The experiencesharpened an incipient talent for subversion.After a year of this, his parents transferred him to a progressive boys’ school,called Muskoka Lakes College, in northern Ontario, where there was very littlesystem to subvert. Although it was called a college, it was basically apreparatory school. Students were encouraged to study whatever they wanted.Paul discovered a mentor in his art teacher, Max Allen, who was gay andpolitically radical. Allen produced a show for the Canadian BroadcastingCompany called As It Happens. In 1973, while the Watergate hearings weregoing on in Washington, DC, Allen let Paul sit beside him in his cubicle at CBCwhile he edited John Dean’s testimony for broadcast. Later, Allen opened asmall theater in Toronto to show movies that had been banned under Ontario’sdraconian censorship laws, and Paul volunteered at the box oɽce. They showed"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Ken Russell’s The Devils and Bernardo Bertolucci’s Last Tango in Paris. In Ted’smind, his son was working in a porno theater. “I just shut my eyes,” Ted said.Paul left school after he was caught forging a check. He attended art schoolbrieɻy, and took some ɹlm classes at a community college, but he dropped outof that as well. He grew his curly blond hair to his shoulders. He began workingin construction full-time for Ted, but he was drifting toward a precipice. In the1970s, London acquired the nickname “Speed City,” because of themethamphetamine labs that sprang up to serve its blossoming underworld. Harddrugs were easy to obtain. Two of Haggis’s friends died from overdoses, and hehad a gun pointed in his face a couple of times. “I was a bad kid,” he admitted.“I didn’t kill anybody. Not that I didn’t try.”He also acted as a stage manager in the ninety-nine-seat theater his fathercreated in an abandoned church for one of his stagestruck daughters. OnSaturday nights, Paul would strike the set of whatever show was under way andput up a movie screen. In that way he introduced himself and the smallcommunity of ɹlm buʃs in London to the works of Bergman, Hitchcock, and theFrench New Wave. He was so aʃected by Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up thatin 1974 he decided to become a fashion photographer in England, like the heroof that movie. That lasted less than a year, but when he returned he still carrieda Leica over his shoulder.Back in London, Ontario, he fell in love with a nursing student named DianeGettas. They began sharing a one-bedroom apartment ɹlled with Paul’s books onɹlm. He thought of himself then as “a loner and an artist and an iconoclast.” Hisgrades were too poor to get into college. He could see that he was goingnowhere. He was ready to change, but he wasn’t sure how.Such was Paul Haggis’s state of mind when he joined the Church ofScientology.LIKE EVERY SCIENTOLOGIST, when Haggis entered the church, he took his ɹrst stepsinto the mind of L. Ron Hubbard. He read about Hubbard’s adventurous life:how he wandered the world, led dangerous expeditions, and healed himself ofcrippling war injuries through the techniques that he developed into Dianetics.He was not a prophet, like Mohammed, or divine, like Jesus. He had not beenvisited by an angel bearing tablets of revelation, like Joseph Smith, the founderof Mormonism. Scientologists believe that Hubbard discovered the existentialtruths that form their doctrine through extensive research—in that way, it is“science.” The apparent rationalism appealed to Haggis. He had long since"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"walked away from the religion of his upbringing, but he was still looking for away to express his idealism. It was important to him that Scientology didn’tdemand belief in a god. But the ɹgure of L. Ron Hubbard did hover over thereligion in suggestive ways. He wasn’t worshipped, exactly, but his visage andname were everywhere, like the absolute ruler of a small kingdom.L. Ron Hubbard in the 1960sThere seemed to be two Hubbards within the church: the godlike authoritywhose every word was regarded as scripture, and the avuncular ɹgure thatHaggis saw on the training videos, who came across as wry and self-deprecating.Those were qualities that Haggis shared to a marked degree, and they inspiredtrust in the man he had come to accept as his spiritual guide. Still, Haggis felt alittle stranded by the lack of irony among his fellow Scientologists. Theirinability to laugh at themselves seemed at odds with the character of Hubbardhimself. He didn’t seem self-important or pious; he was like the dashing,wisecracking hero of a B movie who had seen everything and somehow had itall ɹgured out. When Haggis experienced doubts about the religion, he reɻectedon the 16 mm ɹlms of Hubbard’s lectures from the 1950s and 1960s, whichwere part of the church’s indoctrination process. Hubbard was always chucklingto himself, marveling over some random observation that had just occurred tohim, with a little wink to the audience suggesting that they not take him too"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"seriously. He would just open his mouth and a mob of new thoughts would burstforth, elbowing each other in the race to make themselves known to the world.They were often trivial and disjointed but also full of obscure, learnedreferences and charged with a sense of originality and purpose. “You walked inone day and you said, ‘I’m a seneschal,’ ” Hubbard observed in a characteristicaside,and this knight with eight-inch spurs, standing there—humph—and say, “I’m supposed to open thedoors to this castle, I’ve been doing this for a long time, and I’m a very trusted retainer.”...He’sinsisting he’s the seneschal but nobody will pay him his wages, and so forth.... He was somebodybefore he became the seneschal. Now, as a seneschal, he became nobody—until he ɹnally went out andgot a begging pan on the highway and began to hold it out for ɹsh and chips as people came along, youknow.... Now he says, “I am something, I am a beggar,” but that’s still something. Then the New Yorkstate police come along, or somebody, and they say to him—I’m a little mixed up in my periods here,but they say to him—“Do you realize you cannot beg upon the public road without license Number603-F?”...So he starves to death and kicks the bucket and there he lies.... Now he’s somebody, he’s acorpse, but he’s not dead, he’s merely a corpse.... Got the idea? But he goes through sequences ofbecoming nobody, somebody, nobody, somebody, nobody, somebody, nobody, not necessarily on adwindling spiral. Some people get up to the point of being a happy man. You know the old story of ahappy man—I won’t tell it—he didn’t have a shirt....Just as this fuzzy parable begins to ramble into incoherence, Hubbard comesto the point, which is that a being is not his occupation or even the body hepresently inhabits. The central insight of Scientology is that the being is eternal,what Hubbard terms a “thetan.” “This chap, in other words, was somebody untilhe began to identify his beingness with a thing.... None of these beingnesses arethe person. The person is the thetan.”“He had this amazing buoyancy,” Haggis recalled. “He had a deadpan sense ofhumor and this sense of himself that seemed to say, ‘Yes, I am fully aware that Imight be mad, but I also might be on to something.’ ”The zealotry that empowered so many members of the church came from thebelief that they were the vanguard of the struggle to save humanity. “Acivilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the ablecan prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where Man is free to rise togreater heights, are the aims of Scientology,” Hubbard writes. Those breathlessaims drew young idealists, like Haggis, to the church’s banner.To advance such lofty goals, Hubbard developed a “technology” to attainspiritual freedom and discover oneself as an immortal being. “Scientology works"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerelydesires to improve his life,” a church publication declares. This guarantee restson the assumption that through rigorous research, Hubbard had uncovered aperfect understanding of human nature. One must not stray from the path he haslaid down or question his methods. Scientology is exact. Scientology is certain.Step by step one can ascend toward clarity and power, becoming more oneself—but, paradoxically, also more like Hubbard. Scientology is the geography of hismind. Perhaps no individual in history has taken such copious internal soundingsand described with so much logic and minute detail the inner workings of hisown mentality. The method Hubbard put forward created a road map toward hisown ideal self. Hubbard’s habits, his imagination, his goals and wishes—hischaracter, in other words—became both the basis and the destination ofScientology.Secretly, Haggis didn’t really respect Hubbard as a writer. He hadn’t been ableto get through Dianetics, for instance. He read about thirty pages, then put itdown. Much of the Scientology coursework, however, gave him a feeling ofaccomplishment. In 1976, he traveled to Los Angeles, the center of theScientology universe, checking in at the old Château Élysée, on Franklin Avenue.Clark Gable and Katharine Hepburn had once stayed there, along with manyother stars, but when Haggis arrived it was a run-down church retreat called theManor Hotel.1 He had a little apartment with a kitchen where he could write.There were about 30,000 Scientologists in America at the time. Most of themwere white, urban, and middle class; they were predominantly in their twenties,and many of them, especially in Los Angeles, were involved in graphic orperforming arts. In other words, they were a lot like Paul Haggis. Heimmediately became a part of a community in a city that can otherwise be quiteisolating. For the ɹrst time in his life, he experienced a feeling of kinship andcamaraderie with people who had a lot in common—“all these atheists lookingfor something to believe in, and all these wanderers looking for a club to join.”In 1977, Haggis returned to Canada to continue working for his father, whocould see that his son was struggling. Ted Haggis asked him what he wanted todo with his life. Haggis said he wanted to be a writer. His father said, “Well,there are only two places to do that, New York and Los Angeles. Pick one, andI’ll keep you on the payroll for a year.” Paul chose LA because it was the heartof the ɹlm world. Soon after this conversation with his father, Haggis and DianeGettas got married. Two months later, they loaded up his brown Camaro anddrove to Los Angeles, moving into an apartment with Diane’s brother, Gregg,and three other people. Paul got a job moving furniture. On the weekends he"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"took photographs for yearbooks. At night he wrote scripts on spec at asecondhand drafting table. The following year, Diane gave birth to their ɹrstchild, Alissa.SCIENTOLOGY HAD a giddy and playful air in the mid-seventies, when Haggisarrived in Los Angeles. It was seen as a cool, boutique religion, aimed especiallytoward the needs of artists and entertainers. The counterculture was stillthriving in the seventies, and Scientology both was a part of it and stood apartfrom it. There was a saying, “After drugs, there’s Scientology,” and it was truethat many who were drawn to the religion had taken hallucinogens and wereopen to alternative realities. Recruits had a sense of boundless possibility.Mystical powers were forecast; out-of-body experiences were to be expected;fundamental secrets of the universe were to be revealed.Haggis became friends with other Scientologists who also hoped to make it inHollywood. One of them was Skip Press, a writer and musician on the staʃ ofthe Celebrity Centre, which was the church’s main foothold in the entertainmentindustry. Like many young recruits, Press believed that Scientology had givenhim superhuman powers; for instance, he believed that when he got into theright mental state, he could change traɽc lights to green. He and Haggis formeda casual self-help group with other aspiring writers. They met at a Scientologyhangout across from the Celebrity Centre called Two Dollar Bill’s, where theywould criticize each other’s work and scheme about how to get ahead."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Paul Haggis on vacation in Antigua in 1975, the year he joined the Church of ScientologyEventually, this informal writers club came to the attention of YvonneGillham, the charismatic founder of the Celebrity Centre. Naturally warm andenergetic, Gillham was an ideal candidate to woo the kinds of artists andopinion leaders that Hubbard sought to front his religion. The formerkindergarten director staged parties, poetry readings, workshops, and dances.Chick Corea and other musicians associated with the church often played there.Gillham persuaded Haggis and his circle to hold their meetings at the CelebrityCentre, and they were folded into her web.Haggis and a friend from the writers club eventually got a job scriptingcartoons for Ruby-Spears Productions, beginning with a short-lived series calledDingbat and the Creeps, then Heathcliff. After that, Haggis went on to write RichieRich and Scooby-Doo for Hanna-Barbera. He bought a used IBM Selectrictypewriter. His career began to creep forward.One day, a well-oʃ strawberry farmer from Vancouver introduced himself toHaggis and Skip Press at the Celebrity Centre, saying he wanted to produce alife story of L. Ron Hubbard. He was oʃering ɹfteen thousand dollars for ascript. Press declined, but Haggis accepted the money. His memory is that it wasa horror script that he hoped to interest the strawberry farmer in. He never"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"actually wrote a script about Hubbard, and eventually returned the entire sum,but in Press’s opinion, that was when Haggis’s career began to accelerate. “Themoney enabled Paul to cruise a bit and develop his career. Next thing I knew,Paul was getting an agent.” His Scientology connections were paying off.HAGGIS SPENT much of his time and money taking advanced courses and being“audited,” a kind of Scientology psychotherapy that involves the use of anelectropsychometer, or E-Meter. The device measures bodily changes inelectrical resistance that occur when a person answers questions posed by anauditor. Hubbard compared it to a lie detector. The E-Meter bolstered thechurch’s claim to being a scientiɹc path to spiritual discovery. “It gives Man hisɹrst keen look into the heads and hearts of his fellows,” Hubbard claimed,adding that Scientology boosted some people’s IQ one point for every hour ofauditing. “Our most spectacular feat was raising a boy from 83 IQ to 212,” heonce boasted to the Saturday Evening Post.The theory of auditing is that it locates and discharges mental “masses” thatare blocking the free ɻow of energy. Ideas and fantasies are not immaterial;they have weight and solidity. They can root themselves in the mind as phobiasand obsessions. Auditing breaks up the masses that occupy what Hubbard termsthe “reactive mind,” which is where the fears and phobias reside. The E-Meter ispresumed to measure changes in those masses. If the needle on the meter movesto the right, resistance is rising; to the left, it is falling. The auditor askssystematic questions aimed at detecting sources of “spiritual distress”—problemsat work or in a relationship, for instance. Whenever the client, or “preclear,”gives an answer that prompts the meter needle to jump, that subject becomes anarea of concentration until the auditor is satisɹed that emotional consequencesof the troubling experience have drained away. Certain patterns of needlemovement, such as sudden jumps or darts, long versus short falls, et cetera,have meaning as well. The auditor tries to guide the preclear to a “cognition”about the subject under examination, which leads to a “ɻoating” needle. Thatdoesn’t necessarily mean that the needle is frozen. “The needle just idles aroundand yawns at your questions,” Hubbard explains. The individual shouldexperience a corresponding feeling of release. Eventually, the reactive mind iscleansed of its obsessions, fears, and irrational urges, and the preclear becomesClear.2Haggis found the E-Meter impressively responsive. He would grasp acylindrical electrode in each hand. (When he ɹrst joined Scientology, the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"electrodes were empty Campbell’s soup cans with the labels stripped oʃ.) Animperceptible electrical charge would run from the meter through his body. Themeter seemed able to gauge the kinds of thoughts he was having—whether theywere scary or happy, or when he was hiding something. It was a little spooky.The auditor often probed for what Scientologists call “earlier similars.” If Paulwas having another ɹght with Diane, for instance, the auditor would ask him,“Can you remember an earlier time when something like this happened?” Eachnew memory led further and further back in time. The goal was to uncover andneutralize the emotional memories that were plaguing Paul’s behavior.Often, the process led participants to recall past lives. Although that neverhappened to Haggis, he envied others who professed to have vivid recollectionsof ancient times or distant civilizations. Wouldn’t it be cool if you had manylifetimes before? he thought. Wouldn’t it be easier to face death?Scientology is not just a matter of belief, the recruits were constantly told; itis a step-by-step scientiɹc process that will help you overcome your limitationsand realize your full potential for greatness. Only Scientology can awakenindividuals to the joyful truth of their immortal state. Only Scientology canrescue humanity from its inevitable doom. The recruits were infused with asense of mystery, purpose, and intrigue. Life inside Scientology was just so muchmore compelling than life outside.Preclears sometimes experience mystical states characterized by feelings ofbliss or a sense of blending into the universe. They come to expect suchphenomena, and they yearn for them if they don’t occur. “Exteriorization”—thesense that one has actually left his physical being behind—is a commonlyreported occurrence for Scientologists. If one’s consciousness can actually uprootitself from the physical body and move about at will—what does that say aboutmortality? We must be something more than, something other than, a merephysical incarnation; we actually are thetans, to use Hubbard’s term, immortalspiritual beings that are incarnated in innumerable lifetimes. Hubbard said thatexteriorization could be accomplished in about half the preclears by having theauditor simply command, “Be three feet back of your head.” Free of thelimitations of his body, the thetan can roam the universe, circling stars, strollingon Mars, or even creating entirely new universes. Reality expands far beyondwhat the individual had originally perceived it to be. The ultimate goal ofauditing is not just to liberate a person from destructive mental phenomena; it isto emancipate him from the laws of matter, energy, space, and time—or MEST,as Hubbard termed them. These are just artifacts of the thetan’s imagination, inany case. Bored thetans had created MEST universes where they could frolic and"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"play games; eventually, they became so absorbed in their distractions theyforgot their true immortal natures. They identiɹed with the bodies that theywere temporarily inhabiting, in a universe they had invented for their ownamusement. The goal of Scientology is to recall to the thetan his immortalityand help him relinquish his self-imposed limitations.Once, Haggis had what he thought was an out-of-body experience. He waslying on a couch, and then he found himself across the room, observing himselflying there. The experience of being out of his body wasn’t that grand, and laterhe wondered if he had simply been visualizing the scene. He didn’t have thecertainty his colleagues reported when they talked about seeing objects behindthem or in distant places and times.In 1976, at the Manor Hotel, Haggis went “Clear.” It is the base camp forthose who hope to ascend to the upper peaks of Scientology. The concept comesfrom Dianetics. A person who becomes Clear is “adaptable to and able to changehis environment,” Hubbard writes. “His ethical and moral standards are high, hisability to seek and experience pleasure is great. His personality is heightenedand he is creative and constructive.” Among other qualities, the Clear has aɻawless memory and the capacity to perform mental tasks at unprecedentedrates of speed; he is less susceptible to disease; and he is free of neuroses,compulsions, repressions, and psychosomatic illnesses. Hubbard sums up: “Thedianetic clear is to a current normal individual as the current normal is to theseverely insane.”Haggis was Clear #5925. “It was not life-changing,” he admits. “It wasn’t like,‘Oh my God, I can ɻy!’ ” At every level of advancement, he was encouraged towrite a “success story” saying how eʃective his training had been. He had readmany such stories by other Scientologists, and they felt overly eʃusive, gearedtoward getting through the gatekeepers so that the students could move on tothe next level.THE BRIDGE TO TOTAL FREEDOM is a journey that goes on and on (althoughconfoundingly, in the Scientology metaphor, one moves “higher and higher”—upthe Bridge rather than across it). Haggis quickly advanced through the upperlevels. He was becoming an “Operating Thetan,” which the church deɹnes asone who “can handle things and exist without physical support and assistance.”An editorial in a 1958 issue of the Scientology magazine Ability notes that“neither Buddha nor Jesus Christ were OTs according to the evidence. Theywere just a shade above Clear.”"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"When Haggis joined the church, there were seven levels of Operating Thetans.According to church documents that have been leaked online, Hubbard’shandwritten instructions for Operating Thetan Level One list thirteen mentalexercises that attune practitioners to their relationship with others. Thedirectives for OT I are so open-ended it could be diɽcult to know whether theyhave been satisfactorily accomplished. “Note several large and several smallmale bodies until you have a cognition,” for instance. Or, “Seat yourselfunobtrusively where you can observe a number of people. Spot things andpeople you are not. Do to cognition.” The point is to familiarize oneself withone’s environment from the perspective of being Clear.In the second level, OT II, Scientologists attempt to delete past-life “implants”that hinder progress in one’s current existence. This is accomplished throughexercises and visualizations that explore oppositional forces: “Laughter comesfrom the rear half and calm from the front half simultaneously. Then theyreverse. It gives one a sensation of total disagreement. The trick is to conceiveof both at the same time. This tends to knock one out.”Each new level of achievement marked the entrance to a more select spiritualfraternity. Haggis didn’t have a strong reaction to the material, but then, hewasn’t expecting anything too profound. Everyone knew that the big revelationsresided in OT III.Hubbard called this level the Wall of Fire.“The material involved in this sector is so vicious, that it is carefully arrangedto kill anyone if he discovers the exact truth of it,” he wrote in 1967. “So inJanuary and February of this year I became very ill, almost lost this body, andsomehow or another brought it oʃ, and obtained the material, and was able tolive through it. I am very sure that I was the ɹrst one that ever did live throughany attempt to attain that material.”In the late seventies, the OT mysteries were still unknown, except to theelect. There was no Internet, and Scientology’s conɹdential scriptures had neverbeen published or produced in court. Scientologists looked toward the momentof initiation into OT III with extreme curiosity and excitement. The candidatehad to be invited into this next level—Scientologists were cautioned that thematerial could cause harm or even death to those who were unprepared toreceive it. The enforced secrecy added to the mystique and the giddy air ofadventure.One could look back at this crucial moment and examine the pros and cons ofHaggis’s decision to stay in Scientology. The fact that people often sneered atthe church didn’t deter him; on the contrary, he reveled in being a member of a"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"stigmatized minority—it made him feel at one with other marginalized groups.The main drawback to belief was his own skeptical nature; he was a proudcontrarian, and it would never have occurred to him to join the Baptist church,for instance, or to return to Catholicism; he simply wasn’t interested.Intellectually, faith didn’t call to him. Scientology, on the other hand, was exoticand tantalizing. The weirdness of some of the doctrines was hard to fathom, butthere was no doubt in Haggis’s mind that he had gained some practical beneɹtsfrom his several years of auditing and that his communication skills hadimproved through some of the coursework. None of that had required him to“believe” in Scientology, but the religion had proved itself in certain ways thatmattered to him. The process of induction was so gradual that things that mighthave shocked him earlier were more acceptable by the time he came upon them.Whenever he ran into something on the Bridge to Total Freedom that hecouldn’t fathom, he convinced himself that the next level would makeeverything understandable.Scientology was a part of his community; it had taken root in Hollywood, justas Haggis had. His ɹrst writing jobs had come through Scientology connections.His wife was deeply involved in the church, as was his sister Kathy. His circle offriends was centered in the church. Haggis was deep enough into the process bynow to understand implicitly that those relationships would be jeopardized if hechose to leave the church. Moreover, he had invested a considerable part of hisincome in the program. The incentive to believe was high.He was also looking forward to having the enhanced abilities that his fellowadherents on the Bridge were constantly talking about. Although Hubbard hadexplicitly told Operating Thetans not to use their powers for “parlor tricks,”there was a section of Advance!, a magazine for upper-level Scientologists, titled“OT Phenomena,” where members could report clairvoyant or paranormalexperiences. Parking spaces magically made themselves available and waitersimmediately noticed you. “I saw that my goldɹsh was all red and lumpy,” oneScientologist writes in Advance! “My husband, Rick, said that he’s had goldɹshlike that before and they don’t recover.” The correspondent relates that she usedher abilities to “ɻow energy” into the ɹsh “until a big burst of matter blew. Iended oʃ. When I went home that night the ɹsh was completely healed.” Sheconcludes, “It was a big win for me, and the ɹsh. It couldn’t have been donewithout the technology of L. Ron Hubbard.” Even if such eʃects were randomand diɽcult to replicate, for those who experienced them life was suddenly fullof unseen possibilities. There was a sense of having entered a sphere oftranscendence, where minds communicate with each other across great"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"distances, where wishes and intentions aʃect material objects or cause people tounconsciously obey telepathic orders, and where spirits from other ages or evenother worlds make themselves known.“A theta being is capable of emitting a considerable electronic ɻow,” Hubbardnotes, “enough to give somebody a very bad shock, to put out his eyes or cuthim in half.” Even ordinary actions pose unexpected dilemmas for the OT,Hubbard warns. “How do you answer the phone as an OT?” he asks in one of hislectures. “Supposing you get mad at somebody on the other end of thetelephone. You go crunch! And that’s so much Bakelite. The thing either goesinto a fog of dust in the middle of the air or drips over the ɻoor.” To avoidcrushing telephones with his unfathomable strength, the OT sets up an automaticaction so he doesn’t have to pick the receiver up himself. “Telephone rings, itsprings into the air, and he talks. In other words, through involuntary intentionthe telephone stands there in mid-air.” The promise of employing such powerswas incredibly tantalizing.Carrying an empty briefcase, Haggis went to the Advanced Organizationbuilding in Los Angeles, where the OT III material was held. A supervisorhanded him a manila envelope. Haggis locked it in the briefcase, which waslashed to his arm. Then he entered a secure study room and bolted the doorbehind him. At last, he was able to examine the religion’s highest mysteries,revealed in a couple of pages of Hubbard’s handwritten scrawl. After a fewminutes, Haggis returned to the supervisor.“I don’t understand,” Haggis said.“Do you know the words?”“I know the words, I just don’t understand.”“Go back and read it again,” the supervisor suggested.Haggis did so. In a moment, he returned. “Is this a metaphor?” he asked.“No,” the supervisor responded. “It is what it is. Do the actions that arerequired.”Maybe it’s an insanity test, Haggis thought—if you believe it, you’reautomatically kicked out. He considered that possibility. But when he read itagain, he decided, “This is madness.”1 It has since been spectacularly renovated and turned into Scientology’s premier Celebrity Centre.2 Hubbard sometimes disparaged the term “lie detector” in connection with E-Meters. “In the first place theydo not detect lies and in the second place the police have known too little about the human mind to know"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"that their instrument was actually accurate to an amazing perfection. These instruments should be called‘emotion detectors’ ” (Hubbard, “Electropsychometric Auditing Operator’s Manual,” 1952). According toDavid S. Touretsky, a research professor in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University (and aprominent Scientology critic), what are called “thoughts” are actually “ɻeeting patterns of chemical andelectrical activity in our brains” that have no actual mass. “The meter is really more of a prop or talismanthan a measuring instrument. Interpreting needle movements is like reading tea leaves. A good fortuneteller picks up on lots of subliminal cues that let them ‘read’ their subject, while the tea leaves give thesubject something to ɹxate on. And the subject is heavily invested in believing that the auditor and themeter are eʃective, so it’s a mutually reinforcing system.” The E-Meter measures skin resistance, like a liedetector. “Strong emotional reactions do cause changes in muscle tension or micro-tremors of the ɹngerswill also cause changes in the current ɻowing to the meter, so it’s not purely measuring the physiologicalchanges associated with skin resistance like a real lie detector would. (And real lie detectors also look atother variables, such as pulse and respiration rates.)” (David Touretsky, personal correspondence.)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"T2Sourcehe many discrepancies between Hubbard’s legend and his life haveovershadowed the fact that he genuinely was a fascinating man: anexplorer, a best-selling author, and the founder of a worldwide religiousmovement. The tug-of-war between Scientologists and anti-Scientologists overHubbard’s biography has created two swollen archetypes: the most importantperson who ever lived and the world’s greatest con man. Hubbard himselfseemed to revolve on this same axis, constantly inɻating his actualaccomplishments in a manner that was rather easy for his critics to puncture.But to label him a pure fraud is to ignore the complex, charming, delusional, andvisionary features of his character that made him so compelling to the manythousands who followed him and the millions who read his work. One wouldalso have to ignore his life’s labor in creating the intricately detailedepistemology that has pulled so many into its net—including, most prominently,Hubbard himself.Lafayette Ronald Hubbard was born in Tilden, Nebraska, in 1911, a striking,happy child with gray eyes and wispy carrot-colored hair. His father, Harry Ross“Hub” Hubbard, was in the Navy when he met Ledora May Waterbury, who wasstudying to be a teacher in Omaha. They married in 1909. By the time their onlychild came along two years later, Hub was out of the service and working in theadvertising department of the local Omaha newspaper. May returned to herhometown of Tilden for the birth.When Ron was two, the family moved to Helena, Montana, a gold town thatwas famous all over the West for its millionaires and its prostitutes. It was alsothe capital of the frontier state. Hub managed the Family Theater, which,despite its name, shared a building downtown with two bordellos. Even as ayoung child, Ron loved to watch the vaudeville acts that passed through, but theenterprise shut its doors when a larger theater opened nearby.Ron’s maternal grandparents lived nearby. Lafayette Waterbury was aveterinarian and a well-regarded horseman who doted on his redheadedgrandson. “I was riding broncs at 3½ years,” Hubbard later boasted. Hesupposedly began reading at the same precocious age, and according to the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"church he was “soon devouring shelves of classics, including much of Westernphilosophy, the pillars of English literature, and, of note, the essays of SigmundFreud.”When the United States entered the First World War in 1917, Hubbard’s fatherdecided to re-enlist in the Navy. Ledora got a job with the State of Montana, andshe and six-year-old Ron moved in with her parents, who had relocated toHelena. When the war ended, Hub decided to make a career in the Navy, andthe Hubbard family was launched into the itinerant military life.Hubbard’s family was Methodist. He once remarked, “Many members of myfamily that I was raised with were devout Christians, and my grandfather was adevout atheist.” Ron took his own eccentric path. Throughout his youth, he wasfascinated by shamans and magicians. As a boy in Montana, he says, he wasmade a blood brother to the Blackfoot Indians by an elderly medicine mannamed Old Tom Madfeathers. Hubbard claims that Old Tom would put ondisplays of magic by leaping ɹfteen feet high from a seated position andperching on the top of his teepee. Hubbard observes, “I learned long ago thatman has his standards for credulity, and when reality clashes with these, he feelschallenged.”A signal moment in Hubbard’s narrative is the seven-thousand-mile voyage hetook in 1923 from Seattle through the Panama Canal to Washington, DC, wherehis father was being posted. One of his fellow passengers was CommanderJoseph C. “Snake” Thompson of the US Navy Medical Corps. A neurosurgeon, anaturalist, and a former spy, Thompson made a vivid impression on the boy.“He was a very careless man,” Hubbard later recalled. “He used to go to sleepreading a book and when he woke up, why, he got up and never bothered topress and change his uniform, you know. And he was usually in very bad odorwith the Navy Department.... But he was a personal friend of Sigmund Freud’s.... When he saw me—a defenseless character—and there was nothing to do on abig transport on a very long cruise, he started to work me over.”No doubt Thompson entertained the young Hubbard with tales of hisadventures as a spy in the Far East. Raised in Japan by his father, a missionary,Thompson spoke fluent Japanese. He had spent much of his early military careerroaming through Asia posing as a herpetologist looking for rare snakes whilecovertly gathering intelligence and charting possible routes of invasion.“What impressed me,” Hubbard later remarked, “he had a cat by the name ofPsycho. This cat had a crooked tail, which is enough to impress any young man.And the cat would do tricks. And the ɹrst thing he did was teach me how totrain cats. But it takes so long, and it requires such tremendous patience, that to"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"this day I have never trained a cat. You have to wait, evidently, for the cat to dosomething, then you applaud it. But waiting for a cat to do something whosename is Psycho ...”One of Thompson’s maxims was “If it’s not true for you, it’s not true.” He toldyoung Hubbard that the statement had come from Gautama Siddhartha, theBuddha. It made an impression on Hubbard. “If there’s anybody in the worldthat’s calculated to believe what he wants to believe and to reject what hedoesn’t want to believe, it is I.”Thompson had just returned from Vienna, where he had been sent by theNavy to study under Freud. “I was just a kid and Commander Thompson didn’thave any boy of his own and he and I just got along ɹne,” Hubbard recalls inone of his lectures. “Why he took it into his head to start beating Freud into myhead, I don’t know, but he did. And I wanted very much to follow out this work—wanted very much to. I didn’t get a chance. My father ... said, ‘Son, you’regoing to be an engineer.’ ”THOMPSON WAS ABOUT to publish a review of psychoanalytic literature in the UnitedStates Naval Medical Bulletin; indeed, he may have been working on it as hetraveled to Washington, and no doubt he drew upon the thinking reɻected in hisarticle when he tutored Hubbard in the basics of Freudian theory. “Man has twofundamental instincts—one for self-preservation and the other for racepropagation,” Thompson writes in his review. “The most important emotion ofthe self-preservation urge is hunger. The sole emotion of the race-propagationurge is libido.” Psychoanalysis, Thompson explains, is the “technic” ofdiscovering unconscious motivations that harm the health or happiness of theindividual. Once the patient understands the motives behind his neuroticbehavior, his symptoms automatically disappear. “This uncovering of the hiddenmotive does not consist in the mere explaining to the patient the mechanism ofhis plight. The understanding alone comes from the analytic technic of freeassociation and subsequent rational synthesis.” Many of these thoughts aredeeply embedded in the principles of Dianetics, the foundation of Hubbard’sphilosophy of human nature, which predated the establishment of Scientology.In 1927, Hubbard’s father was posted to Guam, and Ledora went along,abandoning Ron to the care of her parents. For a man as garrulous as L. RonHubbard turned out to be, reflections on his parents are rare, almost to the pointof writing them out of his biography. His story of himself reads like that of anorphan who has invented his own way in the world. One of his lovers later said"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"that he told her that his mother was a whore and a lesbian, and that he hadfound her in bed with another woman. His mistress also admitted, “I neverknew what to believe.”Hubbard made two voyages to visit his parents in Guam. One trip included adetour to China, where he supposedly began his study of Eastern religions afterencountering magicians and holy men. According to the church’s narrative, “Hebraved typhoons aboard a working schooner to ɹnally land on the China coast.... He then made his way inland to ɹnally venture deep into forbidden Buddhistlamaseries.” He watched monks meditating “for weeks on end.” Everywhere hewent, the narrative goes, the teenage Hubbard was preoccupied with a centralquestion: “ ‘Why?’ Why so much human suʃering and misery? Why was man,with all his ancient wisdom and knowledge accumulated in learned texts andtemples, unable to solve such basic problems as war, insanity and unhappiness?”In fact, Hubbard’s contemporary journals don’t really engage suchphilosophical points. His trip to China, which was organized by the YMCA,lasted only ten days. His parents accompanied him, although they are notmentioned in his journals. He did encounter monks, whom he described ascroaking like bullfrogs. The journals reɻect the mind of a budding youngimperialist, who summons an unearned authority over an exotic and unfamiliarculture. “The very nature of the Chinaman holds him back,” Hubbard observeson the ship back to Guam. “The trouble with China is, there are too many chinkshere.”The journals provide a portrait of an adolescent writer trying on his futurecraft by cataloguing plot ideas, such as, “A young American in India with anorganized army for rent to the various rajahs. Usual plot complications.”Another idea: “Love story. Goes to France. Meets swell broad in Marseilles.” Heis trying uncertainly to find his voice:Rex Fraser mounted the knoll and setting his hat more securely against the wind squinted at the huddleof unpainted shacks below him.“So this,” he said to his horse, “is Montana City.”Hubbard entered the School of Engineering at George Washington Universityin the fall of 1930. He was a poor student—failing German and calculus—but heexcelled in extracurricular activities. He began writing for the school newspaper.A new literary magazine at GWU provided a venue for his ɹrst published worksof ɹction. He became director of the gliding club, a thrilling new pastime thatwas just catching on (Hubbard’s gliding license was #385). The actual study of"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"engineering was a secondary pursuit, as his failing grades reflected.In September 1931, Hubbard and his friend Philip “Flip” Browning took a fewweeks oʃ to barnstorm through the Midwest in an Arrow Sport biplane. “Wecarefully wrapped our ‘baggage,’ threw the ɹre extinguisher out to save half ahorsepower, patched a hole in the upper wing, and started oʃ to skim over fouror ɹve states with the wind as our only compass,” Hubbard writes. By now, hehad taken to calling himself “Flash.”Hubbard’s account of this adventure, “Tailwind Willies,” was his ɹrstcommercially published story, appearing in The Sportsman Pilot in January 1932.It was the launch of an unprecedented career. (He would go on to publish morebooks than any other author, according to the 2006 Guinness World Records,with 1,084 titles.)In the spring of 1932, at the height of the Great Depression, Hubbardundertook a venture that displayed many of the hallmarks of his future exploits.He posted a notice on several university campuses: “Restless young men withwanderlust wanted for the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition. Cost toapplicant $250 payable at the dock in Baltimore before sailing. Must be healthy,dependable, resourceful, imaginative, and adventurous. No tea-hounds or touristmaterial need apply.” The goals of the expedition were grand and various—primarily, to make newsreels for Fox Movietone and Pathé News, whileexploring the pirate haunts of the Caribbean and voodoo rites in Haiti. Therewere also vague plans to “collect whatever one collects for exhibits inmuseums.”“It’s diɽcult at any age to recognize a messiah in the making,” wrote one ofthe young men, James S. Free, a journalist who signed on to the expedition. Hewas twenty-three years old, two years older than Hubbard. They were going tobe partners in the adventure, along with Hubbard’s old ɻying buddy, PhilBrowning. “I cannot claim prescient awareness that my soon-to-be businesspartner possessed the ego and talents that would later develop his own privatereligion,” Free wrote in a notebook he titled “Preview of a Messiah.”Hubbard was living with his parents in Washington, DC, when Free arrived.“Ron introduced me to his mother, whose long light brown hair seemed darkbeside the reddish glow of her son’s hair and face,” Free wrote, in one of thefew records of the actual relationship between Hubbard and his mother. “I recalllittle else about her except that like her husband, Navy lieutenant Henry RossHubbard, she plainly adored young Ron and considered him a budding genius.”Hubbard ɹlled Free in on new developments. Phil Browning, the otherpartner, had dropped out at the last minute, but he had managed to get the loan"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"of some laboratory equipment from the University of Michigan; meantime,Hubbard was negotiating with a professional cameraman for the anticipatedɹlms of the voodoo rites “and that sort of salable material.” Thanks to Free’seʃorts to sign up more than twenty new members of the expedition, Hubbardsaid, “We have enough cash to go ahead.”The trip was a calamity from the start. A number of the “buccaneers” whosigned up bailed out at the last minute, but ɹfty-six green collegians with noidea what they were doing clambered aboard the antiquated, four-mastedschooner Doris Hamlin. The adventure began with the Doris Hamlin having to betowed out of Baltimore harbor because of lack of wind. That was almost the endof the expedition, since the tug was pulling toward the sea while the ship wasstill tied to the dock. Once in the Atlantic, the ship was either becalmed inglassy seas or roiling in high chop. The mainsails blew out in a squall as theexpedition steered toward St. Thomas. Seasickness was rampant. At every port,more of the disgusted crew deserted. The only ɹlm that was shot was adesultory cockfight in Martinique.It soon became evident that the expedition was broke. There was no meat orfruit, and the crew was soon reduced to buying their own food in port. Hubbarddidn’t have enough money to pay the only professional sailors on the ship—thecaptain, the ɹrst mate, and the cook—so he oʃered to sell shares in the ventureto his crewmates and borrowed money from others. He raised seven or eighthundred dollars that way, and was able to set sail from Bermuda, only tobecome mired in the Sargasso Sea for four days.After a meager supper one night, George Blakeslee, who had been broughtalong as a photographer, had had enough. “I tied a hangman’s noose in a ropeand everybody got the same idea,” he wrote in his journal. “So we made aneɽgy of Hubbard and strung it up in the shrouds. Put a piece of red cloth on thehead and a sign on it. ‘Our red-headed _____!’ ” Hubbard stayed in his cabin afterthat.The furious captain wired for money, then steered the ship back to Baltimore,pronouncing the expedition “the worst and most unpleasant I ever made.”Hubbard was not aboard as the “jinx ship,” as it was called in the local press,crept back into its home port. He was last seen in Puerto Rico, slipping oʃ witha suitcase in each hand.In some respects, Hubbard discovered himself on that unlucky voyage, whichhe termed a “glorious adventure.” His infatuation with motion pictures ɹrstbecame evident on this trip, although no movies were actually made. Despitethe defections, Hubbard demonstrated an impressive capacity to summon others"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"to join him on what was clearly a shaky enterprise. Throughout his life he wouldenlist people—especially young people—in romantic, ill-conceived projects,often at sea, where he was out of reach of process servers. He was beginning toinvent himself as a charismatic leader. The grandeur of his project was not yetevident, even to him, but in the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition he clearlydeɹned himself as an explorer, sailor, ɹlmmaker, and leader of men, eventhough he failed spectacularly in each of those categories. He had an incorrigibleability to ɻoat above the evidence and to extract from his experiences lessonsthat others would say were irrational and even bizarre. Habitually, and perhapsunconsciously, Hubbard would ɹll this gap—between reality and hisinterpretation of it—with mythology. This was the source of what some call hisgenius, and others call his insanity.WHEN HE WAS TWENTY-THREE, Hubbard married Margaret Louise Grubb, an aspiringaviator four years his senior, whom he called Polly. Amelia Earhart had justbecome the ɹrst female to ɻy solo across the Atlantic, inspiring many daringyoung women who wanted to follow her example. Although Polly never gaineda pilot’s license, it wasn’t surprising that she would respond to Ron’sswashbuckling personality and his tales of far-ɻung adventures. They settled in asmall town in Maryland, near her family farm. Ron was trying to make it as aprofessional magazine writer, but by that point—at the end of 1933—he hadonly half a dozen articles in print. Soon, Polly was pregnant, and Ron had tofind a way to make a living quickly.Pulp ɹction derives its name from the cheap paper stock used in printing thegarish magazines—Weird Tales, Black Mask, Argosy, Magic Carpet—that becamepopular in Depression-era America. The pay for contributors was miserable—thestandard rate was a penny a word. To ɹll the usual 128 pages, each pulpmagazine required 65,000 words, so that the yearly quota to ɹll the 150 pulpweeklies, biweeklies, and monthlies that crowded the newsstands in 1934amounted to about 195,000,000 words. Many well-known writers began theircareers by feeding this gigantic maw, including Dashiell Hammett, H. P.Lovecraft, Erle Stanley Gardner, Raymond Chandler, Ray Bradbury, and EdgarRice Burroughs. The pulps nurtured genres that were perhaps not new but untilthen had never been so blatantly and abundantly expressed.Hubbard’s actual life experiences seemed wonderfully suited for suchliterature. His ɹrst pulp story, “The Green God,” published in ThrillingAdventures in 1934, is about a naval intelligence oɽcer (possibly based on Snake"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Thompson) who is tortured and buried alive in China. “Maybe Because—!,”published in Cowboy Stories, was the ɹrst of Hubbard’s forty-seven westerns,which must have drawn upon his childhood in Montana. Soon, however, therewere stories about submarines and zombies, tales set in Russia or Morocco. Plotwas all that really mattered, and Hubbard’s amazing capacity for inventionreadily colored the canvas. Success in the pulps depended on speed andimagination, and Hubbard had both in abundance. The church estimates thatbetween 1934 and 1936, he was turning out a hundred thousand words of fictiona month. He was writing so fast that he began typing on a roll of butcher paperto save time. When a story was ɹnished, he would tear oʃ the sheet using a T-square and mail it to the publisher. Because the magazines didn’t want an authorto appear more than once in the same issue, Hubbard adopted pen names—Mr.Spectator, Capt. Humbert Reynolds, Rene Lafayette, Winchester RemingtonColt, et cetera—accumulating about twenty aliases over the years. He said thatwhen he was writing stories he would simply “roll the pictures” in his mind andwrite down what he saw as quickly as possible. It was a physical act: he wouldactually perspire when he wrote. His philosophy was “First draft, last draft, getit out the door.”Ron and Polly’s son, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., was born prematurely on May 7,1934, in Encinitas, California, where the couple had gone to vacation. The baby,whom they called Nibs, weighed little more than two pounds at birth. Ronfashioned an incubator out of a cupboard drawer, using a lightbulb to keep itwarm, while Polly fed Nibs with an eyedropper. Two years later, in New YorkCity, Polly gave birth to a daughter, Katherine May Hubbard, whom they calledKay.In 1936, the family moved to Bremerton, Washington, near where Ron’sparents were then living, as well as his mother’s family, the Waterburys. Theywarmly accepted Polly and the kids. Ron was doing well enough to buy a smallfarm in nearby Port Orchard with a house, ɹve bungalows, a thousand feet ofwaterfront, and a view of Mount Rainier—“the prettiest place I ever saw in mylife,” he wrote to his best friend, Russell Hays, a fellow author of pulps wholived in Kansas. Ron spent much of his time in New York, however, cultivatinghis professional contacts, and leaving his wife and children for long periods oftime.Hubbard pined for Hollywood, in what would be a long-term, unrequitedromance. Despite his overtures, he received only “vague oʃers” from studios forshort-term contracts. “I have discarded Hollywood,” he complained to Hays. “Ihaven’t got enough charm.” But in the spring of 1937, Columbia Pictures ɹnally"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"optioned one of Hubbard’s stories to be folded into a serial, titled The Secret ofTreasure Island. Hubbard quickly moved to Hollywood, hoping to ɹnally make itin the movie business. (He later claimed to have worked on a number of ɹlmsduring this time—including the classic ɹlms Stagecoach, with John Wayne, andThe Plainsman, with Gary Cooper—but he never actually received any ɹlmcredits other than The Secret of Treasure Island.) By midsummer he had ɻed backto the farm in Washington, blaming the long hours, tension, and “dumb Jewproducers.”Once again, he threw himself into writing the pulps with a fury, but also witha new note of cynicism. “Never write about a character type you cannot ɹnd inthe magazine for which the story is intended,” he advised Hays. “Never writeabout an unusual character.” Realism was no asset in this kind of writing, hecomplained, remarking on “my utter inability to sell a story which has anyconnection with my own background.... Reality seems to be a very detestedquantity.”Then, on New Year’s Day, 1938, Hubbard had a revelation that would changehis life—and eventually, the lives of many others. During a dental operation, hereceived a gas anesthetic. “While under the inɻuence of it my heart must havestopped beating,” he relates. “It was like sliding helter-skelter down into avortex of scarlet and it was knowing that one was dying and that the process ofdying was far from pleasant.” In those brief, hallucinatory moments, Hubbardbelieved that the secrets of existence were accidentally revealed to him. ForrestAckerman, who later became his literary agent, said that Hubbard told him thathe had risen from the dental chair in spirit form, glanced back at his formerbody, and wondered, “Where do we go from here?” Hubbard’s disembodiedspirit then noticed a huge ornate gate in the distance, which he ɻoated through.On the other side, Ackerman relates, Hubbard discovered “an intellectualsmorgasbord of everything that had ever puzzled the mind of man—you know,how did it all begin, where do we go from here, are there past lives—and like asponge he was just absorbing all this esoteric information. And all of a sudden,there was a kind of swishing in the air and he heard a voice, ‘No, not yet! He’snot ready!’ And like a long umbilical cord, he felt himself being pulled back,back, back. And he lay down in his body, and he opened his eyes, and he said tothe nurse, ‘I was dead, wasn’t I?’ ” The nurse looked startled, and the doctorgave her a dirty look for letting Hubbard know what had happened.In Hubbard’s own written account of the event, he remembers voices cryingout as he is being restored to life, “Don’t let him know!” When he came to, hewas “still in contact with something.” The intimation that he had brieɻy been"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"given access to the divine mystery lingered for several days, but he couldn’t callit back. “And then one morning, just as I awoke, it came to me.”In a fever, he dashed oʃ a small book he titled Excalibur. “Once upon a time,according to a writer in The Arabian Nights, there lived a very wise old man,”the book begins, in the brief portion that the church has published of thefragments it says it has in its possession. The old man, goes the story, wrote along and learned book, but he became concerned that he had written too much.So he sat himself down for ten years more and reduced the original volume toone tenth its size. Even then, he was dissatisɹed, and he constrained the workeven further, to a single line, “which contained everything there was to beknown.” He hid the sacred line in a niche in his wall. But still he wondered,Could all human knowledge be distilled even further?Suppose all the wisdom of the world were reduced to just one line—suppose that one line were to bewritten today and given to you. With it you could understand the basis of all life and endeavor.... Thereis one line, conjured up out of a morass of facts and made available as an integrated unit to explainsuch things. This line is the philosophy of philosophy, thereby carrying the entire subject back into thesimple and humble truth.All life is directed by one command and one command only—SURVIVE.Hubbard sent excited telegrams to publishers in New York, inviting them tomeet him at Penn Station, where he would auction oʃ a manuscript that wouldchange the world. He wrote Polly, “I have high hopes of smashing my name intohistory so violently that it will take a legendary form even if all the books aredestroyed.”But Excalibur was never published, leading some to doubt that it was everwritten. The stories Hubbard later told about the book added to the sense that itwas more mythical than real. He said that when the Russians learned of thebook’s contents, they oʃered him money and laboratory facilities to completehis work. When he turned them down, they purloined a copy of his manuscriptfrom his hotel room in Miami. Hubbard explained to his agent that he ultimatelydecided to withdraw the book from publication because the ɹrst six people whoread it were so shattered by the revelations that they had lost their minds. Thelast time he showed Excalibur to a publisher, he said, the reader brought themanuscript into the room, set it on the publisher’s desk, then jumped out thewindow of the skyscraper.Hubbard despondently returned to the pulps. Five years of torrential outputhad left him exhausted and bitter. His work was “worthless,” he admitted. “I"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"have learned enough of my trade, have developed a certain technique,” hewrote to Hays. “But curbed by editorial fear of reality and hindered by my ownrevolt I have never dared loose the pent flame, so far only releasing the smoke.”That same year Hubbard received an oʃer to write for a magazine calledAstounding Science-Fiction. The editor, John W. Campbell, Jr., twenty-sevenyears old at the time, was to preside over what Hubbard and others would markas the Golden Age of Science Fiction. One of the many brilliant young writerswho would be pulled into Campbell’s orbit, Isaac Asimov, described Campbell as“a tall, large man with light hair, a beaky nose, a wide face with thin lips, andwith a cigarette holder forever clamped between his teeth.” Campbell was anoverbearing champion of extreme right-wing ideas and crackpot science—especially psychic phenomena—and he would hold forth in nonstop monologues,often adopting perverse views, such as supporting slavery, then defending suchpropositions to the point of exhausting everyone in the room. “A deviant ɹgureof marked ferocity,” as the British writer Kingsley Amis observed. On the otherhand, Campbell was also a caring and resourceful editor who groomedinexperienced writers, such as Robert A. Heinlein—ɹrst published inAstounding—and turned them into cultural icons.Campbell considered science ɹction to be something far more than cheapliterary diversion; for him, it amounted to prophecy. His conviction of theimportance of the genre added a mystical allure that other forms of pulp ɹctionnever aspired to. Fanzines and sci-ɹ clubs, composed largely of adolescent boyswho were drawn to the romanticized image of science, formed in many citiesaround the country; some of those fans went on to become important scientists,and their work was animated by ideas that had ɹrst spilled out of the minds ofwriters such as Heinlein, Asimov, and Hubbard. “Science ɹction, particularly inits Golden Age, had a mission,” Hubbard writes. “To get man to the stars.” Hesaw himself as well qualiɹed for the ɹeld: “I had, myself, somewhat of a sciencebackground, had done some pioneer work in rockets and liquid gases.”Hubbard discovered his greatest talents as a writer in the ɹeld of scienceɹction, a more commodious genre and far more intellectually engaging thanwesterns or adventure yarns. Science ɹction invites the writer to grandlyexplore alternative worlds and pose questions about meaning and destiny.Inventing plausible new realities is what the genre is all about. One starts from ahypothesis and then builds out the logic, adding detail and incident to givesubstance to imaginary structures. In that respect, science ɹction and theologyhave much in common. Some of the most closely guarded secrets of Scientologywere originally published in other guises in Hubbard’s science fiction."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Certainly, the same mind that roamed so freely through imaginary universesmight be inclined to look at the everyday world and suspect that there wassomething more behind the surface reality. The broad canvas of science ɹctionallowed Hubbard to think in large-scale terms about the human condition. Hewas bold. He was fanciful. He could easily invent an elaborate, plausibleuniverse. But it is one thing to make that universe believable, and another tobelieve it. That is the difference between art and religion.HUBBARD NOW LIVED two lives: one on the farm in Port Orchard, surrounded by hisparents and Polly and the kids; the other in New York, where he rented anapartment on the Upper West Side. The city rewarded him with the recognitionhe craved. He enjoyed frequent lunches at the Knickerbocker Hotel with hiscolleagues in the American Fiction Guild, where he could swap tales andschmooze with editors. He also became a member of the prestigious ExplorersClub, which added credibility to his frequently told stories of adventure.“In his late twenties, Hubbard was a tall, well-built man with bright red hair,a pale complexion, and a long-nosed face that gave him the look of areincarnated Pan,” a fellow science-ɹction writer, L. Sprague de Camp, laterrecalled. “He arranged in his New York apartment a curtained inclosure the sizeof a telephone booth, lit by a blue light bulb, in which he could work fastwithout distraction.”The fact that Hubbard was a continent away from his wife oʃered him theopportunity to court other women, which he did so openly that he became anobject of wonder among his writer colleagues. Ron blamed Polly for hisphilandering. “Because of her coldness physically, the falsity of her pretensions,I believed myself a near eunuch,” he wrote in a private memoir (which thechurch disputes) some years later. “When I found I was attractive to otherwomen, I had many aʃairs. But my failure to please Polly made me always payso much attention to my momentary mate that I derived small pleasure myself.This was an anxiety neurosis which cut down my natural powers.”One of those momentary mates was named Helen. “I loved her and she me,”Hubbard recorded. “The aʃair would have lasted had not Polly found out.”Polly had discovered two letters to diʃerent women that Hubbard left in themailbox when he was back in Port Orchard; she took the letters, read them,then vengefully switched the envelopes, and put them back in the mail. For awhile, Ron and Polly didn’t speak.They were apparently reconciled in 1940, when the two of them cruised to"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Alaska on their thirty-foot ketch, the Magician, which they called Maggie. Theyleft their children with other family members for the several months they weregone. Hubbard called the trip the Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition, whichentitled him to ɻy the Explorers Club ɻag. The stated goal was to rewrite thenavigation guide of the Alaskan coast using new radio techniques; however,when the engine broke down in Ketchikan, he told a local newspaper that thepurpose was “two-fold, one to win a bet and another to gather material for anovel of Alaskan salmon ɹshing.” Some of Hubbard’s friends, he related, hadwagered that his boat was too small for such a journey, and he was determinedto prove them wrong.While he was stranded in Ketchikan, waiting for a new crankshaft, Hubbardspent several weeks regaling listeners of the local KGBU radio about hisadventures, which included tracking down a German agent who had beenplanted in Alaska with orders to cut oʃ communications in the case of war, andlassoing a brown bear on a ɹshing trip, which proceeded to crawl into the boatwith him.When the crankshaft ɹnally arrived, Ron and Polly headed home, arriving afew days after Christmas, 1940, nearly six months after they set out. Little hadbeen accomplished. “Throughout all this, however,” the church narrative goes,“Mr. Hubbard was continuing in his quest to answer the riddles of man.”THE COMPETING NARRATIVES of Hubbard’s life arrive at a crucial point in the quarrelover his record in the US Navy during the Second World War and the injuries heallegedly received. He certainly longed for a military career, but he failed theentrance examination for the US Naval Academy and was further disqualiɹedbecause of his poor eyesight. He lied—unnecessarily—about his age when hesigned up for the US Marine Corps Reserve in 1930, backdating his birth by twoyears; this stratagem may have helped him get promoted over hiscontemporaries to ɹrst sergeant. His oɽcial record notes that he was “inactive,except for a period of active duty for training.” He requested to be dischargedthe following year because “I do not have the time to devote to the welfare ofthe Regiment.”Months before Pearl Harbor, however, Hubbard was once again angling to geta commission in the Navy. He gathered a number of recommendations, includingone from his congressman, Warren G. Magnuson, who wrote to PresidentFranklin Roosevelt, praising “Captain” Hubbard, “a well-known writer” and “arespected explorer,” who has “marine masters papers for more types of vessels"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"than any other man in the United States.... In writing organizations he is a keyɹgure, making him politically potent nationally.” The congressman concluded:“An interesting trait is his distaste for personal publicity.” Senator Robert M.Ford of Washington signed his name to another letter of recommendation thatHubbard actually wrote for him: “This will introduce one of the most brilliantmen I have ever known: Captain L. Ron Hubbard.”In April 1941, his poor eyesight caused him to fail his physical once again. Butwith German U-boats attacking American shipping in the North Atlantic—andeven in American coastal waters—President Roosevelt declared a nationalemergency, and Hubbard’s physical shortcomings were suddenly overlooked. Hereceived his commission in the Naval Reserve, as a lieutenant (junior grade), inJuly 1941.According to Hubbard, he got into the action right away. He said he wasaboard the destroyer USS Edsall, which was sunk oʃ the north coast of Java. Allhands were lost, except for Hubbard, who managed to get to shore anddisappear into the jungles. That is where he says he was when the Japanesebombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. (Actually, the Edsall was not sunkuntil March 1942.) Hubbard said that he survived being machine-gunned by aJapanese patrol while he was hiding in the area, then escaped by sailing a raft toAustralia. Elsewhere, Hubbard claimed that he had been posted to thePhilippines at the outbreak of the war with Japan, then was ɻown home on theSecretary of the Navy’s private plane in the spring of 1942 as the “ɹrst U.S.returned casualty from the Far East.”According to Navy records, however, Hubbard was training as an intelligenceoɽcer in New York when the war broke out. He was indeed supposed to havebeen posted to the Philippines, but his ship was diverted to Australia because ofthe overwhelming Japanese advance in the Paciɹc. There he awaited othertransport to Manila, but he immediately got on the wrong side of the Americannaval attaché. “By assuming unauthorized authority and attempting to performduties for which he has no qualiɹcation he became the source of much trouble,”the attaché complained. “This oɽcer is not satisfactory for independent dutyassignment. He is garrulous and tries to give impressions of his importance.” Hesent Hubbard back to the United States for further assignment.Hubbard found himself back in New York, working in the Oɽce of the CableCensor. He agitated for a shipboard posting, and was given the opportunity tocommand a trawler that was being converted into a gunboat, the USS YP-422,designed for coastal patrol. “Upon entering the Boston Navy Yard, Ron foundhimself facing a hundred or so enlisted men, fresh from the Portsmouth Naval"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Prison in New Hampshire,” the church narrative goes. “A murderous looking lot,was Ron’s initial impression, ‘their braid dirty and their hammocks black withgrime.’ While on further investigation, he discovered not one among them hadstepped aboard except to save himself a prison term.” Hubbard allegedly spentsix weeks drilling this convict crew, turning them into a splendid ɹghting unit,“with some seventy depth charge runs to their credit and not a single casualty.”But according to naval records, he was relieved of command before the ship waseven launched, by the commandant of the Boston Navy Yard, who declared him“not temperamentally ɹtted for independent command.” There is no record thatHubbard saw action in the Atlantic at any time.The Navy then sent Hubbard to the Submarine Chaser Training Center inMiami. He arrived wearing dark glasses, probably because of conjunctivitis,which plagued him throughout the war and after, but he explained to anotheryoung oɽcer, Thomas Moulton, that he had been standing too close to a large-caliber gun while serving as the gunnery oɽcer on a destroyer in the Paciɹc,and the muzzle ɻash had damaged his eyes. Hubbard’s classmates at the sub-chaser school looked upon him as a great authority because of his wartimeadventures. That he seemed so reticent to boast about them only enhanced hisstanding.While he was in Miami, Hubbard contracted gonorrhea from a woman namedGinger. “She was a very loose person,” he conɹdes in his disputed secretmemoir. “I was terriɹed by it, the consequences of being discovered by mywife, the navy, my friends.... I took to dosing myself with sulfa in suchquantities that I was afraid I had affected my brain.”Wartime sexual diseases were a common aʀiction, and servicemen wereconstantly being cautioned about the dangers of casual romance. AlthoughAmerican sexual relations were freer in practice than the popular cultureadmitted at the time, divorce was still sharply stigmatized; and yet, as a youngman Hubbard seemed to be constantly driven toward reckless liaisons andcourtships that would destroy his marriages and alienate his children (he wouldeventually father seven children by three wives). He admitted in his disputedmemoir that he suʃered from bouts of impotence, which he apparently treatedwith testosterone. He also wrote of his concerns about masturbation, which atthe time was considered a sign of moral weakness that could also lead to manyphysical ailments, such as weak eyesight, impotence, and insanity.HUBBARD WAS FINALLY given another ship of his own, the USS PC-815, and he"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"requested Moulton to join him as his executive oɽcer. The ship was beingconstructed in Portland, Oregon, and when it was ɹnally commissioned, in April1943, the local paper wrote about it, describing Hubbard as a “LieutenantCommander” (he was actually not yet a full lieutenant), who was “a veteransub-hunter of the battles of the Paciɹc and the Atlantic.” There is a photo ofHubbard and Moulton standing in front of the small ship, which was suitedmainly for harbor patrol. Hubbard is wearing his glasses and holding a pipe inhis hands, with the collar of his pea jacket turned up and a determined look onhis face. “These little sweethearts are tough,” he says of the ship. “They couldlick the pants oʃ anything Nelson or Farragut ever sailed. They put up a sizzlingfight and are the only answer to the submarine menace. I state emphatically thatthe future of America rests with just such escort vessels.”It is worth lingering a moment over this overblown statement. The scriptedlanguage might as well have been lifted from one of Hubbard’s pulp-ɹctionheroes. Hubbard must have longed to be such a ɹgure in reality, only to bethwarted by his repeated quarrels with higher authority. Each detail Hubbardoʃers—comparing himself advantageously with history’s greatest naval heroes,asserting that he holds the future of his nation in his hands—testiɹes to his needfor grandeur and heroism, or at least to be seen as grand and heroic. He wouldsoon be given an opportunity.The PC-815 was equipped with depth charges and sonar to detect enemysubmarines. Sonar sends out pinging sounds, which, in clear water, gounanswered, but obstacles, such as enemy submarines—or ɹsh, or debris, oreven schools of shrimp—generate echoes. The art of reading such responses is atricky one, and although Hubbard had trained on the device in sub-chaserschool, he had been near the bottom of his class.He cast oʃ from Astoria, Oregon, for his shakedown cruise on May 18, boundfor San Diego to pick up radar equipment. At 3:40 a.m., only ɹve hours out ofport, the sonar picked up an echo ten miles oʃ Cape Lookout in a heavilytraveled shipping lane. Hubbard and Moulton immediately put on headsets,trying to determine what the object was. In particular, they were listening forthe giveaway sound of a propeller. The craft made no recognition signals thatwould have indicated it was an American vessel. “It made noises like asubmarine and it was behaving like a submarine,” Moulton later testiɹed. “Sowe proceeded to attack.”“The target was moving left and away,” Hubbard wrote in his subsequentAction Report. “The night was moonlit and the sea was ɻat calm.” Theprofessional writer in him warmed to the narrative: “The ship, sleepy and"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"sceptical, had come to their guns swiftly and without error. No one, includingthe Commanding Oɽcer, could readily credit the existence of an enemysubmarine here on the steamer track.”It wasn’t crazy to think that enemy ships might be in the area. A Japanesesubmarine had bombarded an oil facility near Santa Barbara the year before.Another Japanese submarine, the intrepid I-25, had shelled Fort Stevens, at themouth of the Columbia River, not far from where Hubbard and his crew werenow. The I-25 had also smuggled a disassembled seaplane to the Oregon coast inSeptember 1942, where it was put back together and used to drop incendiarybombs in the forest near Mount Emily.Shortly after the ɹrst echo, “with dawn breaking over a glassy sea,” an objectappeared on the surface. Hubbard ordered the guns to open ɹre. It turned out tobe a log. Hours passed. Convinced that the submarine was still out there,Hubbard ordered depth charges dropped on the elusive craft. “Great air boilswere seen and the sound of blowing tanks was reported by the soundman,”Hubbard wrote. “All guns were now manned with great attention as it wassupposed that the sub was trying to surface.” Incredibly, a second submarinewas suddenly detected, only four hundred yards away. Hubbard radioed forassistance and additional explosives. Other naval ships soon arrived, but theywere reluctant to drop their charges on a target they couldn’t seem to locate.Hubbard was furious and blamed their “inexperience or unwillingness” for theirfailure to follow his lead.Hubbard continued the attacks all day and into the next morning. At sevena.m., he reported, “a boil of orange colored oil, very thick, came to the surfaceimmediately on our port bow.... Every man ... then saw the periscope, movingfrom right to left.” His gunners let loose. “The periscope vanished in anexplosion of 20mm bullets.”After sixty-eight hours of action, Hubbard’s ship was ordered to return to port.Hubbard and Moulton claimed that they had succeeded in sinking at least one,possibly two, enemy subs. An oɽcial investigation of the incident concluded,“There was no submarine in the area.” A well-known magnetic deposit nearbymost likely caused the echoes that were picked up on the sonar. The onlyevidence of a submarine was “one bubble of air,” which might well have beenthe result of the turbulence caused by the heavy explosions. Japanese recordsafter the war showed that no submarines had been present oʃ the Oregon coastat the time.1Hubbard continued to San Diego on his shakedown cruise. In June, the PC-815participated in an exercise oʃ the coast of the Mexican state of Baja. Afterward,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"he ordered additional gunnery and small-arms ɹre, shelling South CoronadosIsland, a dry atoll that he apparently failed to realize was a part of Mexico. Hewas admonished for ɹring on an ally and relieved of his command. He feltunjustly treated but also remorseful about the compromised situation he hadplaced his shipmates in. “This on top of having sunk two Jap subs withoutcredit, the way my crew lied for me at the Court of Inquiry, the insults of theHigh Command, all combined to put me in the hospital with ulcers,” Hubbardnoted in his disputed secret memoir. He spent the next three months in a navalhospital in San Diego. In a letter to his family he explained that he had beeninjured when he had picked up an unexploded enemy shell that had landed ondeck and had blown up in midair when he tried to throw it overboard.In October, he got another assignment, this time as the navigation oɽcer onthe cargo ship the USS Algol. The US Navy and Marines had begun their ɹnalisland-hopping campaign before the expected invasion of Japan itself—Operation Downfall. Millions of Allied casualties were forecast. For a manwho wanted to be a hero, there would be a genuine opportunity. Instead,Hubbard requested a transfer to the School of Military Government atPrinceton. “Once conversant with the following languages, but require review:Japanese, Spanish, Chamorro, Tagalog, Peking Pidgin and Shanghai Pidgin,”Hubbard wrote in his application, adding, “Experienced in handling natives, allclasses, in various parts of world.” Through all the carnage, the end of the warwas lurching into view, and the likely occupation of Japan was on the horizon.A polyglot such as Hubbard claimed to be would certainly ɹnd a place in thefuture administration.When he arrived in Princeton, in September 1944, Hubbard fell in with agroup of science-ɹction writers who had been organized into an informalmilitary think tank by his friend Robert Heinlein. The Navy was looking forways to counter the kamikaze suicide attacks on Allied ships, which had begunthat fall as desperation took hold of the Japanese military planners. Hubbardwould spend weekends in Philadelphia at the Heinleins’ apartment, along withsome other of his former colleagues, including his former editor, John Campbell,gaming diʃerent scenarios for the Navy. (Some of their suggestions wereactually tested in combat, but none proved useful.) Heinlein was extremelysolicitous of his old friend, remarking, “Ron had had a busy war—sunk fourtimes and wounded again and again.” The fact that Hubbard had an aʃair withHeinlein’s wife didn’t seem to aʃect his deep regard. “He almost forced me tosleep with his wife,” Hubbard later marveled.There was another lissome young woman hanging around with the science-"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"ɹction crowd: Vida Jameson, whose father, Malcolm, was a part of theCampbell group of Astounding writers. “Quiet, shy little greymouse,” one of thecrowd described Vida, “with great soulful black eyes and a habit of listening.”She was twenty-eight, and already selling stories to the Saturday Evening Post, amore respectable literary endeavor than the pulps. Hubbard proposed to her.She knew he was married and refused his oʃer; still, she was captivated by himand continued her relationship with him until after the war.Hubbard graduated from the School of Military Government in January 1945,and was ordered to proceed to Monterey, California, to join a civil aʃairs team,which would soon follow the invading forces. The Battle of Okinawa, insouthern Japan, got under way that spring, creating the highest number ofcasualties in the Paciɹc Theater. Kamikaze attacks were at their peak. Americantroops suʃered more than 60,000 casualties in less than three months. Japaneseforces were ɹghting to the death. The savagery and scale of the combat hasrarely been equaled.Once again, Hubbard stood on the treacherous precipice, where the prospectof heroic action awaited him—or else indignity, or a death that would beobscured by the deaths of tens of thousands of others. One month after theinvasion of Okinawa, Hubbard was admitted to the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital inOakland, California, complaining of stomach pains.This is a key moment in the narrative of Dianetics and Scientology. “Blindedwith injured optic nerves and lame with physical injuries to hip and back at theend of World War II, I faced an almost nonexistent future,” Hubbard writes ofhimself during this period. “I was abandoned by my family and friends as asupposedly hopeless cripple.” Hubbard says he healed himself of his traumaticinjuries, using techniques that would become the foundation of Dianetics andScientology. “I had no one to help me; what I had to know I had to ɹnd out,” herecalled. “And it’s quite a trick studying when you cannot see.”Doctors at Oak Knoll were never sure exactly what was wrong with him,except for a recurrence of his ulcer. In records of Hubbard’s many physicalexaminations and X-rays, the doctors make no note of scars or evidence ofwounds, nor do his military records show that he was ever injured during thewar.In the hospital, Hubbard says, he was also given a psychiatric examination. Tohis alarm, the doctor wrote two pages of notes. “And I was watching this, youknow, saying, ‘Well, have I gone nuts, after all?’ ” He conspired to take a look atthe records to see what the doctor had written. “I got to the end and it said, ‘Inshort, this oɽcer has no neurotic or psychotic tendencies of any kind"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"whatsoever.’ ” (There is no psychiatric evaluation contained in Hubbard’smedical records.)POLLY AND THE TWO CHILDREN had spent the war waiting for Ron on their plot inPort Orchard, but there was no joyous homecoming. “My wife left me while Iwas in a hospital with ulcers,” Hubbard noted. “It was a terrible blow when sheleft me for I was ill and without prospects.”Soon after leaving the hospital, Hubbard towed a house trailer behind an oldPackard to Southern California, where so many ambitious and rootless membersof his generation were seeking their destiny. There was a proliferation of exoticnew religions in America and many other countries, caused by the tumult of warand disruptions of progress that older denominations weren’t prepared to solve.Southern California was ɹlled with migrants who weren’t tied to old creeds andwere ready to experiment with new ways of thinking. The region was swarmingwith Theosophists, Rosicrucians, Zoroastrians, and Vedantists. Swamis, mystics,and gurus of many different faiths pulled acolytes into their orbits.The most brilliant member of this galaxy of occultists was John WhitesideParsons, known as Jack, a rocket scientist working at what would later becomethe Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Technical Institute. (Parsons,who has a crater on the Moon named after him, developed solid rocket fuel.)Darkly handsome and brawny, later called by some scholars the “James Dean ofthe occult,” Parsons was a science-ɹction fan and an outspoken advocate of freelove. He acquired a three-story Craftsman-style mansion, with a twelve-cargarage, at 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena—a sedate, palm-linedstreet known as Millionaires Row. The house had once belonged to Arthur H.Fleming, a logging tycoon and philanthropist, who had hosted former presidentTheodore Roosevelt, John Muir, and Albert Einstein in its oval dining room. Thestreet had also been home to William Wrigley, of the chewing-gum fortune, andthe beer baron Adolph Busch, whose widow still lived next door.She must have been appalled to watch as Parsons divided the historic homeand the coach house behind it into nineteen apartments, then advertised forrenters. He sought artists, anarchists, and musicians—the more Bohemian thebetter. “Must not believe in God,” the ad stated. Among those passing throughthe “Parsonage” were an aging actress from the silent movie era, an operasinger, several astrologers, an ex-convict, and the chief engineer for thedevelopment of the atomic bomb. A number of children from various alliancesconstantly raced through the house. Parsons threw parties that featured “women"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"in diaphanous gowns,” as one visitor observed, who “would dance around a potof ɹre, surrounded by coɽns topped with candles.” Parsons turned the mansioninto the headquarters of the Agapé Lodge, a branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis,a secret fraternal organization dedicated to witchcraft and sexual “magick,”based on the writings of the notorious British writer and provocateur AleisterCrowley, whose glowering countenance was captured in a portrait hanging inthe stairwell.Despite the bizarre atmosphere that he cultivated, Parsons took hisinvolvement in the OTO seriously, making brazen ethical claims for hismovement—claims that would sound familiar when Scientology arose only afew years later. “The breakup of the home and family, the confusion inproblems of morals and behavior, the frustration of the individual need for love,self-expression and freedom, and the immanence of the total destruction ofwestern civilization all indicate the need for a basic reexamination andalteration of individual and social values,” Parsons writes in a brief manifesto.“Mature investigation on the part of philosophers and social scientists have [sic]indicated the existence of only one force of suɽcient power to solve theseproblems and eʃect the necessary changes, and that is the force of a newreligion.”TWENTY-ONE-YEAR-OLD SARA ELIZABETH “BETTY” NORTHRUP, Parsons’s feisty mistress,was the younger sister of his wife, who had run oʃ with another man. Sara wastall, blond, buxom, and wild, often claiming to have lost her virginity at the ageof ten. “Her chief interest in life is amusement,” one of the boarders observed.But she was also quick and intelligent and full of joy, delighting everyonearound her. She had become involved with Parsons, who was ten years older,when she was ɹfteen. Her parents tolerated the relationship; in fact, herindulgent father helped bankroll the Parsonage, which Sara purchased jointlywith Parsons while she was still a teenager. One evening Robert Heinleinappeared at the house, bringing along his friend L. Ron Hubbard, who waswearing dark glasses and carrying a silver-handled cane. “He was not only awriter but he was a captain of a ship that had been downed in the Paciɹc and hewas weeks on a raft and had been blinded by the sun and his back had beenbroken,” Sara later recalled. “I believed everything he said.”A few months later, Hubbard moved in. He made an immediate, vividimpression on the other boarders. “He dominated the scene with his wit andinexhaustible fund of anecdotes,” one of the boarders, Alva Rogers, later"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"recalled. “Unfortunately, Ron’s reputation for spinning tall tales (both oʃ and onthe printed page) made for a certain degree of skepticism in the minds of hisaudience. At any rate, he told one hell of a good story.” Like Hubbard, Rogershad red hair, and he was intrigued by Hubbard’s theory that redheads are theliving remnant of the Neanderthals.Hubbard invited one of his paramours from New York, Vida Jameson, to joinhim at the Parsonage, with the ostensible task of keeping the books. It’s atestimony to his allure that she came all the way across America to be with him,although soon after she arrived, she discovered that she had been displaced.The other boarders watched in astonishment as Hubbard worked his charmson the available women in the household, before setting his sights on “the mostgorgeous, intelligent, sweet, wonderful girl,” as another envious suitor describedSara Northrup. “There he was, living oʃ Parsons’ largesse and making out withhis girlfriend right in front of him. Sometimes when the two of them weresitting at the table together, the hostility was almost tangible.” Enlivened, nodoubt, by their rivalry over Sara, Parsons and Hubbard quickly developed ahighly competitive relationship. They liked to begin their mornings with a boutof fencing in the living room.Parsons struggled with his feelings of jealousy, which were at war with hisphilosophy of free love. He could understand Northrup’s attraction to the newboarder, describing Hubbard in a letter to Crowley in 1946 as “a gentleman, redhair, green eyes, honest and intelligent.... He moved in with me about twomonths ago.” Then Parsons admits, “Although Betty and I are still friendly, shehas transferred her sexual aʃections to Ron.” He went on to admire Hubbard’ssupernatural abilities. “Although he has no formal training in Magick, he has anextraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the ɹeld. From someof his experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higherintelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. He describes his Angel as a beautifulwinged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guidedhim through his life and saved him many times.”The extent to which Scientology was inɻuenced by Hubbard’s involvementwith the OTO has long been a matter of angry debate. There is little trace inHubbard’s life of organized religion or spiritual philosophy. In the Parsonage, hewas drawn into an obscure and stigmatized creed, based on the writings andpractice of Crowley—the “Great Beast,” as he called himself—who gloried inbeing one of the most reviled men of his era. The Church of Scientologyexplicitly rejects any connection between Crowley’s thinking and Hubbard’semerging philosophy; yet the two men were similar in striking ways. Like"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Hubbard, Crowley reveled in a life of constant physical, spiritual, and sexualexploration. He was a daring, even reckless mountaineer, and his exploitsincluded several failed attempts to climb the world’s most formidable peaks. He,too, was a proliɹc writer who authored novels and plays as well as books onmagic and mysticism. Boisterous and highly self-regarding, he had been kickedout of an occult society called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn afterfeuding with some of its most prominent members, including William ButlerYeats, whom Crowley accused of being envious of his talent as a poet. He mayhave served as a British spy while living in America during World War I, despitethe fact that he was constantly publishing anti-British propaganda. Crowleyrelied on opiates and hallucinogens to enhance his spiritual pursuits. During anexcursion to Cairo in 1904, he discovered his Holy Guardian Angel, adisembodied spirit named Aiwass, who claimed to be a messenger from theEgyptian god Horus. Crowley said that over a period of three days, Aiwassdictated to him an entire cosmology titled The Book of the Law, the mainprinciple of which was, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.”Nibs—Hubbard’s estranged eldest son and namesake, L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. (helater changed his name to Ronald DeWolf)—claimed that his father had read thebook when he was sixteen years old and developed a lifelong allegiance to blackmagic. “What a lot of people don’t realize is that Scientology is black magic justspread out over a long time period,” he contended. “Black magic is the innercore of Scientology—and it is probably the only part of Scientology that reallyworks.”One striking parallel between Hubbard and Crowley is the latter’s assertionthat “spiritual progress did not depend on religious or moral codes, but was likeany other science.” Crowley argued that by advancing through a graded series ofrituals and spiritual teachings, the adept could hope to make it across “TheAbyss,” which he deɹned as “the gulf existing between individual and cosmicconsciousness.” It is an image that Hubbard would evoke in his Bridge to TotalFreedom.Although Hubbard mentions Crowley only glancingly in a lecture—calling him“my very good friend”—they never actually met. Crowley died in 1947 at theage of seventy-two. “That’s when Dad decided that he would take over themantle of the Beast and that is the seed and the beginning of Dianetics andScientology,” Nibs later said. “It was his goal to be the most powerful being inthe universe.”"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"JACK PARSONS EXPERIMENTED with Crowley’s rituals, taking them in his owneccentric direction. His personal brand of witchcraft centered on the adorationof female carnality, an interest Hubbard evidently shared. Parsons recorded inhis journal that Hubbard had a vision of “a savage and beautiful woman ridingnaked on a great cat-like beast.” That became the inspiration for Parsons’s mostaudacious mystical experiment. He appointed Hubbard to be his “scribe” in aceremony called the “Babalon Working.” It was based on Crowley’s notion thatthe supreme goal of the magician’s art was to create a “moonchild”—a creatureforetold in one of Crowley’s books who becomes the Antichrist. Night afternight, Parsons and Hubbard invoked the spirit world in a quest to summon up a“Scarlet Woman,” the female companion who would play the role of Parsons’sconsort. The ceremony, likely aided by narcotics and hallucinogens, requiredHubbard to channel the female deity of Babalon as Parsons performed the“invocation of wand with material basis on talisman”—in other words,masturbating on a piece of parchment. He typically invoked twice a night.Parsons records that during one of these evenings a candle was forciblyknocked out of Hubbard’s hand: “We observed a brownish yellow light aboutseven feet high in the kitchen. I brandished a magical sword and it disappeared.His right arm was paralyzed for the rest of the night.” On another occasion, hewrites, Hubbard saw the astral projection of one of Parsons’s enemies manifesthimself in a black robe. “Ron promptly launched an attack and pinned thephantom figure to the door with four throwing knives.”Evidently, the spirits relented. One day, an attractive young woman namedMarjorie Cameron showed up at the Parsonage. Parsons later claimed that a boltof lightning had struck outside, followed by a knock at the door. A beautifulwoman was standing there. She had been in a traɽc accident. “I don’t knowwhere I am or where I’ve come from,” she told him. (Cameron’s version is thatshe had been interested in the stories of the naked women jumping over ɹres inthe garden, and she persuaded a friend who was boarding at the Parsonage totake her for a visit.) “I have my elemental!” Parsons exclaimed in a note toCrowley a few days later. “She has red hair and slant green eyes as speciɹed....She is an artist, strong minded and determined, with strong masculinecharacteristics and a fanatical independence.”The temple was lit with candles, the room suʃused with incense, andRachmaninoʃ’s “Isle of the Dead” was playing in the background. Dressed in ahooded white robe, and carrying a lamp, Hubbard intoned, “Display thyself toOur Lady; dedicate thy organs to Her, dedicate thy heart to Her, dedicate thymind to Her, dedicate thy soul to Her, for She shall absorb thee, and thou shalt"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"become living ɻame before She incarnates.” Whereupon Parsons and Cameronresponded, “Glory unto the Scarlet Woman, Babalon, the Mother ofAbominations, that rideth upon the Beast.” Then, as Hubbard continued theincantation, Parsons and Cameron consummated the ceremony upon the altar.This same ritual went on for three nights in a row. Afterward, Parsons wrote toCrowley, “Instructions were received direct through Ron, the seer.... I am to actas instructor guardian guide for nine months; then it will be loosed on theworld.”Crowley was unimpressed. “Apparently Parsons or Hubbard or somebody isproducing a Moonchild,” he complained to another follower. “I get fairly franticwhen I contemplate the idiocy of these goats.” Cameron did become pregnant,but got an abortion, with Parsons’s consent, so it’s unclear exactly what thisceremony was designed to produce. (Parsons and Cameron later married andaborted another pregnancy.) Nonetheless, Parsons asserted that the ritual hadbeen a success. “Babalon is incarnate upon the earth today, awaiting the properhour for her manifestation,” he wrote after the ceremony. “And in that day mywork will be accomplished, and I shall be blown away upon the Breath of thefather.”Until that apocalypse occurred, Hubbard and Parsons decided, they would gointo business together. The plan was for Hubbard to purchase yachts in Florida,sail them through the Panama Canal to California, and resell them at a proɹt.Parsons and Sara sold the Parsonage and handed over the money to Hubbard—more than twenty thousand dollars from Parsons alone. Hubbard and Northruppromptly left for Miami.While in Florida, Hubbard appealed to the Veterans Administration for anincrease in his medical disability. He was already receiving compensation for hisulcers, amounting to $11.50 per month. “I cannot tolerate a general diet—results in my having to abandon my old profession as a ship master andexplorer, and seriously hampers me as a writer.” He said his eyesight had beenaʃected by “prolonged exposure to tropical sunlight,” incurred while he was inthe service, which caused a chronic case of conjunctivitis. He also complainedthat he was lame from a bone infection, which he theorized must have occurredby the abrupt change in climate when he was shipped to the East Coast. “Myearning power, due to injuries, all service connected, has dropped to nothing,”he summed up. Sara Northrup added a handwritten note of support. “I haveknow [sic] Lafayette Ronald Hubbard for many years,” she claimed. “I see nochance of his condition improving to a point where he can regain his oldstandards. He is becoming steadily worse, his health impaired again by"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"economic worries.”Parsons grew to believe that Hubbard and Sara had other plans for his money,and he ɻew to Miami to confront them. When he learned that they had justsailed away, he performed a “Banishing Ritual,” invoking Bartzabel, a magicalɹgure associated with Mars. According to Parsons, a sudden squall arose, rippingthe sails oʃ the ship that Hubbard was captaining, forcing him to limp back toport. Sara’s memory was that she and Ron were on their way to California,when they were caught in a hurricane in the Panama Canal. The ship was toodamaged to continue the voyage. Parsons gained a judgment against the couple,but declined to press criminal charges, possibly because his sexual relationshipwith Sara had begun while she was still below the age of consent, and shethreatened to retaliate. Hubbard’s friends were alarmed, both about his businessdealings with Parsons and his romance with Sara. “Keep him at arm’s length,”Robert Heinlein warned a mutual friend. His wife, Virginia, regarded Ron as “avery sad case of post-war breakdown,” and Sara as Hubbard’s “latest Man-EatingTigress.”Sara repeatedly refused Ron’s entreaties to marry him, but he threatened tokill himself unless she relented. She still saw him as a broken war hero whomshe could mend. Finally, she said, “All right, I’ll marry you, if that’s going tosave you.” They awakened a minister in Chestertown, Maryland, on August 10,1946. The minister’s wife and housekeeper served as witnesses to the wedding.The news ricocheted among Hubbard’s science-ɹction colleagues. “I supposePolly was tiresome about not giving him his divorce so he could marry six othergals who were all hot & moist over him,” one of Hubbard’s writer friends, L.Sprague de Camp, wrote to the Heinleins. (In fact, Polly didn’t learn of themarriage till the following year, when she read about it in the newspapers.)“How many girls is a man entitled to in one lifetime, anyway?” de Camp fumed.“Maybe he should be reincarnated as a rabbit.”The Church of Scientology admits that Hubbard was involved with Parsonsand the OTO, characterizing it, however, as a secret mission for navalintelligence. The church claims that the government had been worried about topAmerican scientists—including some from Los Alamos, where the atom bombwas developed—who made a habit of staying with Parsons when they visitedCalifornia. Hubbard’s mission was to penetrate and subvert the organization.“Mr. Hubbard accomplished the assignment,” the church maintains. “Heengineered a business investment that tied up the money Parsons used to fundthe group’s activities, thus making it unavailable to Parsons for his occultpursuits.” Hubbard, the church claims, “broke up black magic in America.”"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"EVEN IF HUBBARD WAS a government spy, as the church claims, the available recordsshow him at what must have been his lowest point in the years just after thewar. His physical examination at the Veterans Administration in Los Angeles inSeptember 1946 notes, “No work since discharge. Lives on his savings.” (The VAeventually increased his disability to forty percent.) Sara noticed that he washaving nightmares. That winter, they moved into a lighthouse on a frozen lakein the Poconos near Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. It was an unsettling time forSara; they were isolated, and Ron had a .45 pistol that he would ɹre randomly.Late one night, while she was in bed and Ron was typing, he hit her across theface with the pistol. He told her that she had been smiling in her sleep, so shemust have been thinking about someone else. “I got up and left the house in thenight and walked on the ice of the lake because I was terriɹed,” Sara said in1997, in an account she dictated shortly before she died. She was so shocked andhumiliated she didn’t know how to respond.Ron had begun beating her in Florida, shortly after her father died. Her griefseemed to provoke Ron—she assumed it was because she wasn’t being who heneeded her to be. No one had ever struck her before. She recognized now howdangerous their relationship was; on the other hand, Ron’s need for her was sostark. He had been blocked for a long time, and Sara had been churning outplots for him, and actually writing some of his stories. Ron worried that hewould never write again. He frequently threatened suicide. Sara didn’t believein divorce—it was a terrible stigma at the time—and she still thought she couldsave Ron. “I kept thinking that he must be suʃering or he wouldn’t act thatway.” And so, she went back to him.Ron took a loan and bought a house trailer, and he and Sara drove across thecountry to Port Orchard, where his parents and his undivorced ɹrst wife andchildren were living. Sara had no idea why people treated her so strangely, untilɹnally Hubbard’s son Nibs told her that his parents were still married. Onceagain, Sara ɻed. Ron found her waiting for the ferry that was leaving forCalifornia. The engines of the ship grumbled as Ron hastily pleaded his case. Hetold her that he really was getting a divorce. He claimed that an attorney hadassured him that he and Sara actually were legally married. Finally, the ferryleft without her.Soon after that, Ron and Sara set out for Hollywood. They got as far as Ojai,California, where Ron was arrested for failing to make payments on the housetrailer they were living in.In October 1947, Hubbard sent the VA an alarming and revealing plea:"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"I am utterly unable to approach anything like my own competence. My last physician informed me thatit might be very helpful if I were to be examined and perhaps treated psychiatrically or even by apsychoanalyst.... I avoided out of pride any mental examinations, hoping that time would balance amind which I had every reason to suppose was seriously aʃected.... I cannot, myself, aʃord suchtreatment.Would you please help me?Nothing came of this request. There is no record that the VA conducted apsychological assessment of Hubbard. Throughout his life, however, questionswould arise about his sanity. Russell Miller, a British biographer, tracked downan ex-lover of Hubbard’s, who described him as “a manic depressive withparanoid tendencies.” The woman, whom Miller called “Barbara Kaye” (her realname was Barbara Klowden), later became a psychologist. She added, “He saidhe always wanted to found a religion like Moses or Jesus.” A man who laterworked in the church as Hubbard’s medical officer, Jim Dincalci, listed his traits:“Paranoid personality. Delusions of grandeur. Pathological lying.” Dr. StephenWiseman, a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University ofBritish Columbia, who has been a prominent critic of Scientology, speculatedthat a possible diagnosis of Hubbard’s personality would be “malignantnarcissism,” which he characterizes as “a highly insecure individual protectinghimself with aggressive grandiosity, disavowal of any and every need fromothers, antisocial orientation, and a heady and toxic mix ofrage/anger/aggression/violence and paranoia.”And yet, if Hubbard was paranoid, it was also true that he really was oftenpursued, ɹrst by creditors and later by grand juries and governmentinvestigators. He may have had delusions of grandeur, as so many critics say,but he did in fact make an undeniable mark on the world, publishing many bestsellers and establishing a religion that endures decades after his death.Grandiosity might well be a feature of a personality that could accomplish suchfeats.A fascinating glimpse into Hubbard’s state of mind during this time is found inwhat I am calling his secret memoir. The church claims that the document is aforgery. It was produced by the former archivist for the Church of Scientology,Gerald Armstrong, in a 1984 suit that the church brought against him. Armstrongread some portions of them into the record over the strong objections of thechurch attorneys; others later found their way onto the Internet. The churchnow maintains that Hubbard did not write this document, although when it wasentered into evidence, the church’s lawyers made no such representation, saying"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"that the papers were intensely private, “constitute a kind of self-therapy,” anddid not reflect Hubbard’s actual condition.This disputed document has been called the Aɽrmations, or the Admissions,but it is rather diɽcult to deɹne. In part, the thirty pages constitute a highlyintimate autobiography, dealing with the most painful episodes in Hubbard’slife. Many of the references to people and events made in these pages aresupported by other documents. It appears that Hubbard is using techniques onhimself that he would later develop into Dianetics. He explores memories thatpose impediments in his mental and spiritual progress, and he prescribesaɽrmations or incantations to counter the psychological inɻuence of theseevents. These statements would certainly be the most revealing and intimatedisclosures Hubbard ever made about himself.There are three sections in this document, each of which seems to have adifferent purpose.The ɹrst section is called “Course I.” This is what I have termed the secretmemoir, as it contains reflections on the most embarrassing or troubling featuresof Hubbard’s biography. “The purpose of this experiment is to re-establish theambition, willpower, desire to survive, the talent and conɹdence of myself,”Hubbard declares straightforwardly at the start. “I was always anxious aboutpeople’s opinion of me and was afraid I would bore them. This injected anxietyand careless speed into my work. I must be convinced that I can write skillfullyand well.” Those who criticize his work are fools, he writes. “I must beconvinced I have succeeded in writing and with ease will regain my popularity,which actually was not small.”“My service record was none too glorious,” he admits. He also confesses hisshame about his frequent aʃairs. But he is intent on succeeding in hisrelationship with Sara, whom he describes as “young, beautiful, desirable.”Unfortunately, he is handicapped by bouts of impotence. “I want her always.But I am 13 years older than she. She is heavily sexed. My libido is so low Ihardly admire her naked.”Sex preoccupies him. He’s worried about his “very bad masturbatory history,”his sexual diseases, and his impotence, which he had been treating withtestosterone supplements. “By eliminating certain fears of hypnosis, curing myrheumatism and laying oʃ hormones, I hope to restore my former libido. Imust!”Through self-hypnosis, he hopes to convince himself of certain prescriptivemantras, including:I can write."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"My mind is still brilliant.That masturbation was no sin or crime.That I do not need to have ulcers anymore.That I am fortunate in losing Polly and my parents, for they never meant well by me.That I believe in my gods and spiritual things.That my magical work is powerful and effective.That the numbers 7, 25, and 16 are not unlucky or evil for me.That I am not bad to look upon.That I am not susceptible to colds.That Sara is always beautiful to me.That these words and commands are like ɹre and will sear themselves into every corner of my being,making me happy and well and confident forever!The second part of the document, labeled “Course II,” included the statementsthat have come to be called Aɽrmations, although Hubbard refers to them asincantations. He had recently gotten a new recorder for dictation, called aSoundScriber. It may be that he recorded this portion and played it back tohimself as a means of self-hypnosis. This section begins with the command “Youare asleep.”In this lesson, Hubbard tells himself, he will learn several important things:You have no urge to talk about your navy life. You do not like to talk of it. You never illustrate yourpoint with bogus stories. It is not necessary for you to lie to be amusing and witty.You like to have your intimate friends approve of and love you for what you are.

Hubbard loves her but reassures himself that his Guardian doesnot control him. In all things, he is the controlling force. She seems to be an"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"artifact of the influence of Aleister Crowley. Jack Parsons had said that Hubbardcalled his Guardian “the Empress.”His fear of hypnotism is quite striking. He was an accomplished stagehypnotist, a skill he displayed at a meeting of a group of sci-ɹ fans in LosAngeles, when he put nearly everyone in the audience into a trance, andpersuaded one of them that he was holding a pair of miniature kangaroos in thepalm of his hand. He also once tried to hypnotize Sara’s mother, after she had astroke, to persuade her to leave her money to him. But then he would accuseSara of hypnotizing him in his sleep.If one looks behind the Aɽrmations to the conditions they are meant tocorrect, one sees a man who is ashamed of his tendency to fabricate personalstories, who is conɻicted about his sexual needs, and who worries about hismortality. He has a predatory view of women but at the same time fears theirpower to humiliate him.The third and ɹnal section of this document is titled “The Book.” It contains achecklist of personal goals and compliments he pays to himself, but it is also aportrait of the superman that he wishes to be. He does make mention of anactual book—he calls it One Commandment—that seems to be a reference toExcalibur. “It freed you forever from the fears of the material world and gaveyou material control over people,” he writes.You are radiant like sunlight.You can read music.You are a magnificent writer who has thrilled millions.Ability to drop into a trance state at will.Lack of necessity of following a pulp pattern.You did a fine job in the Navy.

The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liarwhen it comes to his history, background, and achievements. The writings and documents in evidenceadditionally reɻect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, and vindictiveness and aggressivenessagainst persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he ischarismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating, and inspiring hisadherents.... Obviously, he is and has been a very complex person, and that complexity is furtherreflected in his alter ego, the Church of Scientology.IN 1948, ten years after his ɹrst attempt to establish himself as a screenwriter,Hubbard had returned to Hollywood, setting up shop as a freelance guru. “Iwent right down in the middle of Hollywood, I rented an oɽce, got a hold of anurse, wrapped a towel around my head and became a swami,” Hubbard latersaid. “I used to sit in my penthouse on Sunset Boulevard and write stories forNew York and then go to my oɽce in the studio and have my secretary telleverybody I was in conference while I caught up on my sleep,” he recalled onanother occasion. He painted a far diʃerent picture in a letter to the VeteransAdministration, which was demanding reimbursement for an overpayment: “Icannot imagine how to repay this $51.00 as I am nearly penniless and have but$28.50 to last me for nearly a month to come,” he writes. “My expendituresconsist of $27 a month trailer rent and $80 a month food for my wife and selfwhich includes gas, cigarettes and all incidentals. I am very much in debt andhave not been able to get a job.” Instead of repaying the VA, he boldly asks for aloan.In Hollywood, Hubbard began perfecting techniques that he ɹrst developed inthe naval hospital and that later became Dianetics. He boasts to Hays, “Beenamusing myself making a monkey out of Freud. I always knew he was nutty butdidn’t have a ɹrm case.” He adds that he has been conducting research oninferiority complexes: “Nightly had people writhing in my Hollywood oɽce,sending guys out twice as tall as superman.” For the ɹrst time, he ɻoats the ideaof a book, which he tentatively titles An Introduction to Traumatic Psychology. Hethinks it will require about six weeks to write. “I got to revolutionize this hereɹeld because nobody in it, so far as I can tell, knows his anatomy from a gopherhole.”Hubbard was casting around for a new direction in his life. He took up actingat the Geller Theater Workshop, paid for in part by the VA, but that didn’tsatisfy him. There was a larger plan stirring in his imagination. “I was hidingbehind the horrible secret. And that is I was trying to ɹnd out what the mind"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"was all about,” he recalls. “I couldn’t even tell my friends; they didn’tunderstand. They said, ‘Here’s Hubbard, he’s leading a perfectly wonderful life.He gets to associate with movie actresses. He knows hypnotism and so has notrouble with editors. He has apartments and stuff.’ ”IT WAS THE LARVAL STAGE of Hubbard’s astonishing transformation—from thedepressed, rejected, impoverished, creatively exhausted ɹgure he paints in theAɽrmations, to his nearly overnight success as a thinker and founder of aninternational movement when his book Dianetics was finally published. He wrotehis friend Robert Heinlein, “I will soon, I hope give you a book risen from theashes of the old Excalibur which details in full the mathematics of the humanmind, solves all the problems of the ages, and gives six recipes for aphrodisiacsand plays the mouth organ with the left foot.” He writes a little aboutrecovering from the war, then remarks, “The main diɽculty these days isgetting sane again. I ɹnd out that I am making progress. Of course there isalways the danger that I will get too sane to write.” He is angling for aGuggenheim grant for his book on psychology. Meantime, he was so pressedɹnancially that he begged Heinlein for a loan of ɹfty dollars. “Golly, I neverwas so many places in print with less to show for it,” Hubbard complained. “Icouldn’t buy a stage costume for Gypsy Rose Lee.”Hubbard was writing these letters from Savannah, Georgia, in the waningdays of 1948 and the spring of 1949. He said he was volunteering in apsychiatric clinic at St. Joseph’s Medical Center, “getting case histories at therequest of the American Psychiatric Assoc.” It is a shadowy period in his life, butit was in Savannah that he began to sketch out the principles that would formthe basis of his understanding of the human mind. He claimed to be gettingphenomenal results on nearly every malady he addressed. “One week ago Ibrought in my ɹrst asthma cure,” he writes to Heinlein. “I have an arthritis tofinish tomorrow and so it goes.”It’s unclear whether Hubbard himself was receiving treatment in Savannah.“My hip and stomach and side are well again,” he writes to Heinlein, adding thathe is “straightening out the kinks that have held down production on the moneymachine.”In his letters, Hubbard continually speculates about the book he hopes toɹnish soon. “It ain’t agin religion,” he boasts to Heinlein. “It just abolishes it....It’s science, boy, science.” He makes a vague reference to the research he’sperforming on children. “This hellbroth I cooked up works remarkably well on"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"kids,” he remarks. “Took a scared little kid that was supposed to be stupid andwas failing everything and worked on him about thirty-ɹve hours just to makesure. That was last month. So now he turns up this afternoon with all A’s and allof a sudden reading Shakespeare.” He was also noting improvement in himself,both in his work and in his recovered sexual powers. “I am cruising on fourhours sleep a night. But the most interesting thing is, I’m up to eight comes. Inan evening, that is.”Heinlein was eager for details. Hubbard responded by outlining what hewould later call the Tone Scale. It describes the range of human emotionalstates, from one to four. At bottom, there is Apathy, then Anger. These lowertones were governed by the unconscious, which Hubbard says should be calledthe “reactive mind.” The third level, which was as yet untitled, is the normalstate for most of humanity; and the fourth is a condition of happiness andindustriousness. Hubbard’s experimental technique aimed at raising anindividual out of the lower tones and into the superior state of the fourth tone.His method, as he described it to Heinlein, was to drain oʃ the painfulexperiences and associations that an individual has accumulated in his lifetime.Once that’s done, “astonishing results take place.” Asthma, headaches, arthritis,menstrual cramps, astigmatism, and ulcers simply disappear. There is a hugeboost in competence. The reactive mind is eliminated, and the rational mindtakes over.At the end of April 1949, Hubbard sent a note to Heinlein that he was movingto Washington, DC, for an indeɹnite stay. There was no word about Sara. Threeweeks later, the thirty-eight-year-old Hubbard applied for a license inWashington to marry twenty-six-year-old Ann Jensen. The application wascanceled the next day at the request of the bride. Perhaps she had learned thatHubbard was already married to his second wife and had previously committedbigamy. In any case, Ann Jensen’s name disappears from Hubbard’s life story.He and Sara moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where John Campbell,Hubbard’s editor at Astounding Science-Fiction before the war, resided. Campbellvisited Hubbard often and became one of his ɹrst and most important converts.“Dammit, the man’s got something—and something big,” he wrote excitedly toHeinlein.Campbell underwent the treatment, which employed “deep hypnosis.” In thatentranced state, Campbell was able to retrieve traumatic memories of his birth.“I was born with a cord wrapped around my neck, strangling me,” he recountedto Heinlein. The doctor who delivered him, whom Campbell now rememberedhad a German accent, had barked at Campbell’s mother, saying, “You must stop"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"ɹghting—you are killing him. Relax!” Later, the doctor put some corrosivemedication in the baby’s eyes, and said, “You’ll forget all about this in a littlewhile.” Campbell characterized these instructions as “unshakeable post-hypnoticcommands of tremendous force,” which governed much of his subsequentbehavior. “The neighbor bratlings could tease me unmercifully—and did—because I couldn’t ɹght,” he told Heinlein; his mother would often attempt toconsole him by telling him that he would forget the painful experiences of hischildhood soon enough, with the result that many of the most importantmoments of his life were lost to him. “Ron’s technique consists of bringing theseold memories into view, and then erasing the memory,” Campbell explained. Hewrites that although he now doesn’t remember his actual birth, he doesremember retrieving it and relating it to Hubbard, who then erased the realmemory, with its painful associations, leaving Campbell with the experience ofknowing what happened to him without actually having the memory continueits sinister inɻuence. Obviously, the line between a real memory and animplanted one, or a confabulation, was very difficult to draw.This was the most potent medicine ever discovered, Campbell continued, butalso the most dangerous weapon imaginable if not properly handled. “With theknowledge I now have, I could turn most ordinary people into homicidalmaniacs within one hour.” And yet, as an editor, Campbell recognized thecommercial possibilities: “This is the greatest story in the world—far bigger thanthe atomic bomb.” He added in a postscript that he had also lost twenty poundsin twenty-ɹve days—another commercial bonanza. Campbell was beside himselfbecause Hubbard had yet to actually start writing the book. “The key to worldsanity is in Ron Hubbard’s head, and there isn’t even an adequate writtenrecord!”In December, Ron and Sara moved into what Hubbard termed “a little oldshack” in Bayhead, New Jersey, with eight bedrooms, near the beach. In March1950, he sent the Heinleins a handmade miniature book catalogue from“Hubbard House” publishers, proclaiming the spring collection:AnnouncingA New Hubbard EditionCompletely New MaterialNot a revisionCo-Authors—Ron & Sara HubbardRelease Date March 8, ’50—11:50 A.M.Weight—9 lbs. 2 oz. — Height—21 in."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Alexis ValerieHas received rave notices from all reviewers!Alexis was the image of her father, who delighted in her precociousness. “Ronis going at a little less than the speed of light all day and every day,” Sara wroteto the Heinleins, “then, in the middle of the night he goes in and tells Alexis allabout it.”Ron promised to send Heinlein a galley of Dianetics as soon as it wasavailable. He reported that it was 180,000 words, “begun Jan. 12, ’50, ɹnishedFeb. 10, oʃ the press by April 25.” When one of his followers asked Hubbardhow he had been able to dash it oʃ so quickly, Hubbard said that his guardianspirit, the Empress, had dictated it to him.Like several other prominent sci-ɹ writers of the Golden Age, includingHeinlein and A. E. van Vogt, Hubbard had been strongly inɻuenced by thewritings of Alfred Korzybski, a Polish American philosopher who created thetheory of general semantics. In New Jersey, Sara read Korzybski and quotedseveral passages aloud to Ron, who immediately grasped the ideas as the basisfor a system of psychology, if not for a whole religion.Korzybski pointed out that words are not the things they describe, in the sameway that a map is not the territory it represents. Language shapes thinking,creating mental habits, which can stand in the way of sanity by preservingdelusions. Korzybski argued that emotional disturbances, learning disorders, andmany psychosomatic illnesses—including heart problems, skin diseases, sexualdisorders, migraines, alcoholism, arthritis, even dental cavities—could beremedied by semantic training, much as Hubbard would claim for his own work.He cited Korzybski frequently, although he admitted that he could never getthrough the texts themselves. “Bob Heinlein sat down one time and talked forten whole minutes on the subject of Korzybski to me and it was very clever,” helater related. “I know quite a bit about Korzybski’s works.”From this secondhand knowledge, Hubbard saw the need for creating a specialvocabulary, which would allow him to deɹne old thoughts in new ways (thesoul becomes a thetan, for instance); or invent new words, such as “enturbulate”(confuse) and “hatting” (training); or use words and phrases in a novel manner,such as turning adjectives or verbs into nouns, or vice versa (“an overt,” “astatic,” “alter-isness”); plus a Pentagon-level glut of acronyms—all of whichwould entrap his followers in a self-referential semantic labyrinth.Hubbard granted his friend and acolyte John Campbell a scoop by letting himbuy a lengthy excerpt of his forthcoming book. Thus the world got its ɹrst look"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"at Dianetics in the pages of Astounding Science-Fiction. “This article is not a hoax,joke, or anything but a direct, clear statement of a totally new scientiɹc thesis,”Campbell warns his readers, who might be confused by ɹnding a work ofscholarship in a pulp magazine. “I know dianetics is one of, if not the greatest,discovery of all Man’s written and unwritten history,” he wrote to a puzzledcontributor. “It produces the sort of stability and sanity men have dreamedabout for centuries.” He assured a young writer that Hubbard would win theNobel Peace Prize for his work.The book itself, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, appeared inMay. It was completely unexpected, given Hubbard’s history as a writer. Heintended it to stand as a capstone to the “ɹfty thousand years of thinking menwithout whose speculations and observations the creation and construction ofDianetics would not have been possible.” In Scientology, Dianetics is known asBook One. “With 18 million copies sold, it is indisputably the most widely readand inɻuential book on the human mind ever published,” the church maintains.Scientology dates its own calendar from 1950, the year Dianetics was published.Hubbard’s theory is that the mind has two parts. The analytical, or conscious,mind is the center of awareness, the storehouse of all past perceptions. Nothingis lost from its data banks. Every smell or pattern or sound attached to one’sprevious experiences is present and capable of being completely recaptured. Thisis the mind that observes and thinks and solves problems. It is rational andaware of itself.The other form of mentality is the reactive mind. It is the single source ofnightmares, insecurity, and unreasonable fears. It doesn’t think. It is a repositoryof painful and destructive emotions, which are recorded even while anindividual is sleeping, or unconscious, or still in the womb. The recording is notthe same as a memory, in the sense of being a mental construct; it is physically apart of the cellular structure and capable of reproducing itself in generations ofnew cells. “Cells are evidently sentient in some currently inexplicable way,”Hubbard speculates. When awakened by some stimulus, the recording—Hubbardcalls it an “engram”—turns oʃ the conscious mind and seizes control of anindividual’s actions or behavior.Hubbard compares the engram to a posthypnotic suggestion. He describes aman in a trance who has been told that every time the operator touches his tie,the subject will remove his coat. When the subject is awakened, he is notconsciously aware of the command. “The operator then touches his tie,”Hubbard writes. “The subject may make some remark about its being too warmand so take his coat oʃ.” This can be done repeatedly. “At last the subject may"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"become aware, from the expressions on people’s faces, that something is wrong.He will not know what is wrong. He will not even know that the touching of thetie is the signal which makes him take oʃ his coat.” The hypnotic command inhis unconscious continues to govern his behavior, even when the subjectrecognizes that it is irrational and perhaps harmful. In the same way, Hubbardsuggests, engrams work their sinister inɻuence on everyday actions,undermining one’s self-conɹdence and subverting rational behavior. Theindividual feels helpless as he engages in behavior he would never consciouslyconsent to. He is “handled like a marionette by his engrams.”Although there were no recorded case histories to prove his claim thathundreds of patients had been cured through his methods, through “many yearsof exact research and careful testing,” Hubbard oʃered appealing examples ofhypothetical behavior. For instance, a woman is beaten and kicked. “She isrendered ‘unconscious.’ ” In that state, she is told she is no good, a faker, andthat she is always changing her mind. Meantime, a chair has been knocked over;a faucet is running in the kitchen; a car passes outside. All of these perceptionsare parts of the engram. The woman is not aware of it, but whenever she hearsrunning water or a car passing by, the engram is partly restimulated. She feelsdiscomfort if she hears them together. If a chair happens to fall as well, sheexperiences a shock. She begins to feel like the person she was accused of beingwhile she was unconscious—a ɹckle, no-good faker. “This is not theory,”Hubbard repeatedly asserts. It is an “exact science” that represents “anevolutionary step in the development of Man.”Hubbard proposed that the inɻuence engrams have over one’s currentbehavior can be eliminated by reciting the details of the original incident until itno longer possesses an emotional charge.4 “Dianetics deletes all the pain from alifetime,” Hubbard writes. “When this pain is erased in the engram bank andreɹled as memory and experience in the memory banks, all aberrations andpsychosomatic illnesses vanish.” The object of Dianetics therapy is to drain theengrams of their painful, damaging qualities and eliminate the reactive mindentirely, leaving a person “Clear.”WRITTEN IN a bluʃ, quirky style, and overrun with patronizing footnotes that dolittle to substantiate its bold ɹndings, Dianetics nonetheless became a sensation,lodging itself for twenty-eight weeks on the New York Times best-seller list andlaying the groundwork for the category of postwar self-help books that wouldseek to emulate its success. Hundreds of Dianetics groups sprang up around the"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"United States and in other countries in order for its adherents to apply thetherapeutic principles Hubbard prescribed. One only needed a partner, called anauditor, who could guide the subject to locate his engrams and bring them intoconsciousness, where they would be released and rendered harmless. “You willfind many reasons why you ‘cannot get well,’ ” Hubbard warns, but he promises,“Dianetics is no solemn adventure. For all that it has to do with suʃering andloss, its end is always laughter, so foolish, so misinterpreted were the thingswhich caused the woe.”The book arrived at a moment when the aftershocks of the world war werestill being felt. Behind the exhilaration of victory, there was immense trauma.Religious certainties were shaken by the development of bombs so powerful thatcivilization, if not life itself, became a wager in the Cold War contest. Loss,grief, and despair were cloaked by the stoicism of the age, but patients beingtreated in mental hospitals were already on the verge of outnumbering thosebeing treated for any other cause. Psychoanalysis was suspiciously viewed inmuch of America as a European—mainly Jewish—import, which was time-consuming and fantastically expensive. Hubbard promised results “in less thantwenty hours of work” that would be “superior to any produced by several yearsof psycho-analysis.”The profession of psychiatry, meantime, had entered a period of brutalexperimentation, characterized by the widespread practice of lobotomies andelectroshock therapy. The prospect of consulting a psychiatrist was accompaniedby a justiɹed sense of dread. That may have played a role in Hubbard’s decisionnot to follow up on his own request for psychiatric treatment. The appearanceof a do-it-yourself manual that claimed to demystify the secrets of the humanmind and produce guaranteed results—for free—was bound to attract anaudience. “It was sweepingly, catastrophically successful,” Hubbard marveled.The scientiɹc community, stupeɹed by the book’s popularity, reacted withhostility and ridicule. It seemed to them little more than psychological folk art.“This volume probably contains more promises and less evidence per page thanhas any publication since the invention of printing,” the Nobel physicist IsidorIsaac Rabi wrote in his review of Dianetics for Scientific American. “The huge saleof the book to date is distressing evidence of the frustrated ambitions, hopes,ideals, anxieties and worries of the many persons who through it have soughtsuccor.” Erich Fromm, one of the predominant thinkers of the psychoanalyticmovement, denounced the book as being “expressive of a spirit that is exactlythe opposite of Freud’s teachings.” Hubbard’s method, he complains, “has norespect for and no understanding of the complexities of personality.” He"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"derisively quotes Hubbard: “In an engineering science like Dianetics we canwork on a push-button basis.” But, of course, that was part of the theory’simmense appeal.One of the most painful reviews of Dianetics, no doubt, was by Korzybski’smost notable intellectual heir (and later, US senator from California), S. I.Hayakawa. He not only dismissed the book, he also criticized what he saw asthe spurious craft of writing science ɹction. “The art consists in concealing fromthe reader, for novelistic purposes, the distinctions between established scientiɹcfacts, almost-established scientiɹc hypotheses, scientiɹc conjectures, andimaginative extrapolations far beyond what has even been conjectured,” hewrote. The writer who produces “too much of it too fast and too glibly” runs therisk of believing in his own creations. “It appears to me inevitable that anyonewriting several million words of fantasy and science-ɹction should ultimatelybegin to internalize the assumptions underlying the verbiage.” Dianetics,Hayakawa noted, was neither science nor ɹction, but something else: “ɹctionalscience.”Not all scientists rejected Hubbard’s approach. One of his early supporters wasCampbell’s brother-in-law Dr. Joseph Winter, a physician who had also writtenfor Astounding Science-Fiction. Searching for a more holistic approach tomedicine, Winter traveled to New Jersey to experience Hubbard’s methodɹrsthand. “While listening to Hubbard ‘running’ one of his patients, or whilebeing ‘run’ myself, I would ɹnd myself developing unaccountable pains invarious portions of my anatomy, or becoming extremely fatigued andsomnolent,” he reported. “I had nightmares of being choked, of having mygenitalia cut oʃ, and I was convinced that dianetics as a method could produceeffects.”Hubbard’s method involved placing the patient in a state of “reverie,”achieved by giving the command “When I count from one to seven your eyeswill close.” A tremble of the lashes as the eyelids ɻutter shut signals that thesubject has fallen into a receptive condition. “This is not hypnotism,” Hubbardinsists. Although a person in a Dianetic reverie may appear to be in a trance, theopposite is the case, he says: “The purpose of therapy is to awaken a person inevery period of his life when he has been forced into ‘unconsciousness.’Dianetics wakes people up.”Sara watched the eʃect that Ron was having on his patients. “He would holdhands with them and try to talk them into these phony memories,” she recalled.“He would concentrate on them and they loved it. They were so excited aboutsomeone who would just pay this much attention to them.”"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Dr. Winter tried out Hubbard’s techniques on his six-year-old son, who wasafraid of the dark because he was terriɹed of being choked by ghosts. Winterasked him to remember the ɹrst time he saw a ghost. “He has on a long whiteapron, a little white cap on his head and a piece of white cloth on his mouth,”the boy said. He even had a name for the ghost—it happened to be the same asthat of the obstetrician who delivered him. Winter then asked his son to look atthe “ghost” in his mind repeatedly, until the boy began to calm down. “Whenthe maximum relaxation had apparently been obtained after ten or twelverecountings, I told him to open his eyes,” Winter reported. “It has been over ayear since that short session with my son, and he has not had a recurrence of hisfear of the dark in all that time.”The idea that early memories—even prenatal ones—could be recaptured wascentral to Hubbard’s theory. Every engram rooted in the reactive mind has itspredecessors; the object of Dianetics therapy is to hunt down the original insult,the “basic-basic,” which produced the engram in the ɹrst place. Freud had alsopostulated that childhood traumas would be played out in later life throughsymptoms of hysteria or neurosis. In his famous Wolf Man case, for instance,Freud traced a childhood neurosis in his patient to the sight of his parentscopulating when he was a year and a half old. “Everything goes back to thereproduction of scenes,” Freud thought at the time. He recognized that in manycases such childhood memories were clearly invented, but from an analyticalperspective, they were still useful, because the emotions and associationsattached to the confabulations opened a window onto the patient’s subconscious.False childhood memories were often as deeply believed in as real ones, butwhat made them stand apart from actual memories was that they were almostalways the same, unvarying from patient to patient; they must be somehowuniversal. Freud’s protégé Carl Jung would seize on this fact to construct histheory of the Collective Unconscious. Freud himself came to believe that whatwas a false memory in a present-day patient’s mind had been a reality at somepoint in prehistory. “It seems to me quite possible that all the things that aretold to us to-day in analysis as phantasy—the seduction of children, theinɻaming of sexual excitement by observing parental intercourse, the threat ofcastration...—were once real occurrences in the primaeval times of the humanfamily, and that children in their phantasies are simply ɹlling in the gaps inindividual truth with prehistoric truth.” And yet Freud continued to be troubledby the fact that many of these supposed memories were formed at a suspiciouslyearly age. “The extreme achievement on these lines is a phantasy of observingparental intercourse while one is still an unborn baby in the womb,” he noted"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"wryly. That absurdity was one of the reasons he eventually cast aside theseduction theory.For Hubbard, however, early or even prenatal traumas were literally true. Hebelieved that the fetus not only recorded details of his parents copulating duringhis pregnancy, but also every word spoken during the act. Such recordings canbe restimulated in adult life by hearing similar language, which would thenawaken the anxiety that the fetus experienced—during a violent sexual episode,for instance. That could lead to “aberration,” which for Hubbard includes allpsychoses, neuroses, compulsions and any other deviation from rationalbehavior. Engrams form chains of similar incidents, Hubbard suggests. He givesthe example of seventeen prenatal engrams found in a single individual, who“had passed for ‘normal’ for thirty-six years of his life.” Among them:COITUS CHAIN, FATHER. 1st incident zygote. 56 succeeding incidents. Two branches, father drunk andfather sober.COITUS CHAIN, LOVER. 1st incident embryo. 18 succeeding incidents. All painful because ofenthusiasm of lover.FIGHT CHAIN. 1st incident embryo. 38 succeeding incidents. Three falls, loud voices, no beating.ATTEMPTED ABORTION, SURGICAL. 1st incident embryo. 21 succeeding incidents.ATTEMPTED ABORTION, DOUCHE. 1st incident fetus. 2 incidents. 1 using paste, 1 using Lysol, verystrong.MASTURBATION CHAIN. 1st incident embryo. 80 succeeding incidents. Mother masturbating withfingers, jolting child and injuring child with orgasm.And so on, all leading up to:BIRTH. Instrument. 29 hours labor.Hubbard’s view of women as revealed in this and many other examples is notjust contemptuous; it betrays a kind of horror. He goes on to make this amazingstatement: “It is a scientiɹc fact that abortion attempts are the most importantfactor in aberration. The child on whom the abortion is attempted is condemnedto live with murderers whom he reactively knows to be murderers through allhis weak and helpless youth!” In his opinion, it is very diɽcult to abort a child,which is why the process so often fails. “Twenty or thirty abortion attempts arenot uncommon in the aberree and in every attempt the child could have beenpierced through the body or brain,” Hubbard writes. “However many billionsAmerica spends yearly on institutions for the insane and jails for the criminals"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"are spent primarily because of attempted abortions done by some sex-blockedmother to whom children are a curse, not a blessing of God.”One of the charges that would be lobbed against Hubbard by his disaʃectedeldest son was that his father had attempted two abortions on his mother. “OneI observed when I was around six or seven,” L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., later testiɹed.He recalled seeing his father standing over his mother with a coat hanger in hishand. The other attempted abortion was upon himself. “I was born at six and ahalf months and weighed two pounds, two ounces. I mean, I wasn’t born: this iswhat came out as a result of their attempt to abort me.” Hubbard himself writesin his secret memoir that Polly was terriɹed of childbirth, “but conceiveddespite all precautions seven times in ɹve years resulting in ɹve abortions andtwo children.” While he was writing Dianetics, and Sara was pregnant withAlexis, she says, Hubbard kicked her in the stomach several times to attempt tocause a miscarriage. Later, Hubbard told one of his lovers that he himself hadbeen born of an attempted abortion.While Hubbard was still writing Dianetics, he contacted both the AmericanPsychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association, representinghimself as a colleague who had made fundamental advances in the science.Patients placed in a trance state, he explained, could be guided to remembertheir own births. In sixteen of what he says were the twenty cases that heexamined, psychosomatic illnesses had been caused by pre-birth or birthtraumas. “Migraine headache, ulcers, asthma, sinusitis and arthritis wereamongst those illnesses relieved,” he asserted. In a similar letter to the AmericanGerontological Society, he also claimed that sixteen of the twenty cases hadbeen made measurably younger. His preliminary title for the work was “CertainDiscoveries and Researches Leading to the Removal of Early TraumaticExperiences Including Attempted Abortion, Birth Shock and Infant Accidents andIllnesses with an Examination of Their Eʃects on the Adult Mind and an Accountof Techniques Evolved and Employed.” When scientists tested some ofHubbard’s claims and found that his techniques produced no measurableimprovement, he blamed them for failing to understand his system.Hubbard’s rejection by the mental health establishment, even before Dianeticswas published, was itself a kind of pre-birth trauma. After that, wheneverDianetics or Scientology was attacked in the press or by governments, Hubbardsaw the hand of psychiatrists. “The psychiatrist and his front groups operatestraight out of the terrorist textbooks,” he wrote bitterly years later. “The Maɹalooks like a convention of Sunday school teachers compared to these terroristgroups.” Toward the end of his life he concluded that if psychiatrists “had the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"power to torture and kill everyone, they would do so.... Recognize them forwhat they are: psychotic criminals—and handle them accordingly.” Psychiatrywas “the sole cause of decline in this universe.”HUBBARD SET UP schools to train auditors in major cities, which, along with thebook sales and his lecture fees, generated a cascade of revenue. “The money wasjust pouring in,” Sara marveled. Hubbard began carrying huge wads of casharound in his pocket. “I remember going past a Lincoln dealer and admiring oneof those big Lincolns they had then,” Sara recalled. “He walked right in thereand bought it for me, cash!”The people who were drawn to Dianetics were young to middle-aged white-collar Protestants who had a pronounced interest in science ɹction. Some weremotivated by the prospect of employment in this booming new ɹeld. Otherswere truth seekers, often veterans of other movements and cults that wereresponding to the dislocations of the era. And then there were those who hadheard the legend of the heroic Navy oɽcer who had been blinded and crippledby the war, who had healed himself through Dianetic techniques. Like Hubbard,they sought a cure. Society and science had let them down. Through Dianetics,they hoped to be lifted up, enlightened, restored, and made whole.One of the contradictory features of Dianetics is the fact that Hubbardcontinually referred to the powers of Clears, but as yet he had not actuallyproduced a single one for inspection. Among other powers, a Clear “hascomplete recall of everything which has ever happened to him or anything hehas ever studied. He does mental computations such as those of chess, forexample, which a normal would do in half an hour, in ten or ɹfteen seconds.”Such claims presumed that there was already a sizable population of Dianeticgraduates with exceptional abilities, and Hubbard’s readers naturally wonderedwhere they were.In August 1950, Hubbard presented the “World’s First Clear” at the ShrineAuditorium in Los Angeles. Sonia Bianca, a very nervous physics student fromBoston, was brought to the stage. Hubbard claimed that through Dianetics,Bianca had attained “full and perfect recall of every moment of her life.” Theaudience began peppering her with questions, such as what she had had forbreakfast eight years before, or what was on this page of Hubbard’s book, oreven elemental formulas in physics, her area of specialty. She was incapable ofresponding when someone asked the color of Hubbard’s necktie, when he brieɻyhad his back turned to her. It was a very public ɹasco. Hubbard would not"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"announce another Clear for sixteen years. One of his disillusioned acolytes laterconcluded that the concept of clearing was just a gimmick to dramatize thetheory of Dianetics. “The fact is that there were never any clears, as he haddescribed them,” Helen O’Brien, Hubbard’s top executive in the United States,wrote. “There were randomly occurring remissions of psychosomatics.”Meanwhile, his bigamous marriage to Sara was careening toward a spectacularconclusion. A month after the Sonia Bianca debacle, Ron and Sara were living atthe Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. He was beating her regularly. “With orwithout an argument, there’d be an upsurge of violence,” Sara recalled. “Theveins in his forehead would engorge” and he would strike her, “out of the blue.”One time he broke her eardrum. And yet, she stayed with him, a hostage to hisneeds. “I felt so guilty about the fact that he was so psychologically damaged,”Sara said. “I felt as though he had given so much to our country and I couldn’teven bring him peace of mind. I believed thoroughly that he was a man of greathonor, had sacriɹced his well being to the country.... It just never occurred tome he was a liar.” Ron ɹnally explained his dilemma: he didn’t want to bemarried—“I do not want to be an American husband for I can buy my friendswhenever I want them”—but divorce would hurt his reputation. The solution: ifSara really loved him, she should kill herself.Sara took little “Alexi,” as she called their daughter, and moved into the LosAngeles Dianetics Research Foundation, in a former governor’s mansion near theUniversity of Southern California campus. Soon after that, Sara began an aʃairwith another man, Miles Hollister.Hubbard furiously told his own lover, Barbara Klowden, that Sara and Mileswere plotting to have him committed to a mental institution. Indeed, Sara hadconsulted a psychiatrist about Hubbard’s condition. She told him that Ron hadsaid he would rather kill her than let her leave him. The psychiatrist said thatHubbard probably needed to be institutionalized, and he warned Sara that herlife was in danger.Nonetheless, Sara went directly to Ron and told him what the doctor had said.If he got treatment, she said, she would stay with him; otherwise, she was goingto leave. Ron responded by threatening to kill their child. “He didn’t want her tobe brought up by me because I was in league with the doctors,” Sara recalled, inher deathbed tape. “He thought I had thrown in with the psychiatrists, with thedevils.”On the night of February 24, 1951, Sara went to the movies and left her babyin the care of a young man named John Sanborne, who was studying at thefoundation. Alexis had become a kind of celebrity, or at least a curiosity."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Hubbard had been touting her as the world’s ɹrst “dianetic baby”—shieldedsince birth against any engram-forming disruptions or parental conɻict. As aresult, Hubbard boasted, Alexis talked at three months, crawled at four, and hadno phobias. At about ten o’clock, eleven-month-old Alexis began crying in hercrib, so Sanborne picked her up to comfort her. Suddenly, the infant said in ahoarse whisper, “Don’t sleep.” Sanborne was startled. He didn’t think a babycould talk like that. “It went through me in a funny way,” he later said. “Thehair raising on the back of the neck type of feeling.”At eleven p.m. there was a knock on the door. One of Hubbard’s aidesappeared, wearing a topcoat, with his hand in his pocket. Sanborne believed hewas carrying a gun. The man said that Hubbard was here to take his daughter.Hubbard himself then came through the door, also wearing a topcoat, with hishand in his right pocket. They took the child and disappeared.Later that night Hubbard returned with two other men to abduct Sara. “Wehave Alexis and you’ll never see her alive unless you come with us,” Hubbardsaid. They tied her hands and dragged her out of bed into a waiting Lincoln. Shesays that Hubbard had her in a chokehold to keep her from screaming.Hubbard’s assistant, Richard de Mille (son of the famous movie director andproducer Cecil B. DeMille), drove aimlessly, while Hubbard and Sara, who waswearing only a nightgown, sat in back. She warned him that kidnapping was acapital offense.In San Bernardino, Hubbard ordered de Mille to stop at the county hospital sohe could have Sara committed, but it was the middle of the night and no doctorwould talk to him. Eventually, Hubbard and Sara negotiated a truce. Hubbardtold her where Alexis was hidden—he had hired a nurse in West Los Angeles towatch her—and Sara signed a note saying that she had gone with Hubbard of herown free will. Hubbard and de Mille went to the Yuma, Arizona, airport andɻew to Phoenix, while Sara drove the Lincoln back to Los Angeles in hernightgown to pick up Alexis. When she arrived at the nursing center, however,she was told that a young couple had just left with the baby.Hubbard and de Mille ɻew on to Chicago, where Hubbard voluntarilypresented himself for a psychological examination in order to counter theaccusation that he was a paranoid schizophrenic. The psychologist administeredsome diagnostic tests, including Rorschach inkblots, and later provided a reportthat said that Hubbard was a creative individual who was upset by familyproblems and depressed about his work. Hubbard was extremely pleased; hewould often mention that he had been given a clean bill of health by thepsychological profession. Sara remembered that he then called her and told her"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"that he had killed Alexis. “He said that he had cut her into little pieces anddropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs ɻoatingdown the river and it was my fault, I’d done it because I’d left him,” Sararemembered.Hubbard and de Mille then traveled to Elizabeth, New Jersey, where theDianetics Foundation had its headquarters. Meantime, the young couple thatHubbard had hired to abduct Alexis from the nursing center drove the infant allthe way across the country to deliver her to Hubbard. It was the middle ofMarch and snowing in New Jersey, so Hubbard decided to move on to Florida,where he intended to write his next book. De Mille came along with the baby.After a few days in Tampa, Hubbard still felt edgy and announced that the threeof them were ɻying to Cuba. “He believed that as long as he had the child hecould control the situation,” de Mille told one of Hubbard’s biographers.For six weeks, Sara had searched for Alexis in Southern California, enlistinglocal police, sheriffs, and the FBI, but the authorities regarded the abduction as adomestic dispute. Finally, she ɹled a writ of habeas corpus demanding Alexis’sreturn, setting oʃ a press uproar. On April 23, 1951, Sara added to the sensationby ɹnally ɹling for divorce in Los Angeles County, revealing that Hubbard wasalready married when they wed. She accused Hubbard of subjecting her to“systematic torture,” including sleep deprivation, beatings, strangulations, and“scientiɹc torture experiments.” She said that she had consulted medicalprofessionals, who concluded that Hubbard was “hopelessly insane, and crazy.”Soon afterward, Sara received a surprising letter of support from Polly:If I can help in any way, I’d like to—You must get Alexis in your custody—Ron is not normal. I hadhoped that you could straighten him out. Your charges probably sound fantastic to the average person—but I’ve been through it—the beatings, threats on my life, all the sadistic traits you charge—twelveyears of it.... Please do believe I do so want to help you get Alexis.Meantime, in Havana, Hubbard hired a couple of women to take care of thebaby. They kept her in a crib with wire over the top. To de Mille, it seemed thatAlexis was being held like a monkey in a cage.Cuba was run by mobsters, who had turned it into a hedonistic paradise, butHubbard took little advantage of the nightlife; he locked himself in a hotelroom, rented an old typewriter with Spanish-language keys, and began to write.According to de Mille, Hubbard wrote all night with a bottle of rum at hand,which was empty in the morning.The book Hubbard was pounding out in Havana was Science of Survival. He"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"introduced his readers to the Tone Scale, which had evolved since he sketched itout in his letter to Robert Heinlein two years before. The scale classiɹesemotional states, starting at zero, Body Death. The lower tones are characterizedby psychosis, where hatred and anger give way to perversion, artful lying,cowardice, withdrawal, and apathy. “People below the 2.0 level, no matter theiravowed intention, will bring death or injury to persons, things and organizationsaround them if in the anger bracket, or death to themselves if in the apathybracket,” Hubbard writes. “Anyone below 2.0 level is a potential suicide.” Theirbodies stink, as does their breath. At 2.5, there is a break point between thenormal and the neurotic. This stage is characterized by boredom, vagueness,indiʃerence, and pointless conversation. At level 3.0 one enters a stage thatHubbard characterizes as “very high normal,” where one is resistant toinfections, tolerant, and reasonable; however, he is also insincere, careless, anduntrustworthy.Clear registers 4.0 on the scale. A person who has attained this level is nearlyaccident-proof and immune to bacteria. He is exhilarated, eager, strong, able,curious, ethical, creative, courageous, responsible, and impossible to hypnotize.And yet this state is only one-tenth of what Hubbard forecasts in the realm ofhuman potential. His scale goes all the way to 40.0, Serenity of Beingness, butthe capabilities of the upper regions are largely unknown.Given the circumstances that surrounded the creation of this book, it’sinteresting to read what Hubbard writes about sexual behavior and attitudestoward children. Not only was he on the run in Cuba with his abducted daughterwhen he wrote this, he was also being sued for non-support of the two childrenfrom his ɹrst marriage, whom he hadn’t seen for years. “Sex,” he wrote, “is anexcellent index of the position of the preclear on the Tone Scale.” The highestlevels are characterized by monogamy, constancy, a pleasurable attitude towardsex, and an intense interest in children, although the urge to procreate ismitigated by the sublimation of sexual desire into pure creative thought. At 3.0on the scale, sexual interest is diminished but the urge to procreate remainshigh. That begins to fall oʃ at 2.5, “not for any reason beyond a general failureto be interested in anything.” Children are tolerated, but there is little interest intheir aʃairs. At 2.0, sex becomes revolting and children provoke anxiety. Rapeand child abuse characterize 1.5.Then Hubbard arrives at a level that preoccupies him, 1.1 on the Tone Scale.“Here is the harlot, the pervert, the unfaithful wife, Free Love, easy marriageand quick divorce and general sexual disaster,” he writes. “A society whichreaches this level is on its way out of history.” A mother who is at 1.1 on the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Tone Scale will attempt to abort her child. However, once the child is born, “weget general neglect and thoughtlessness about the child and no feelingwhatsoever about the child’s future or any eʃort to build one for it. We getcareless familial actions, such as promiscuity, which will tear to pieces thefamily security upon which this child’s future depends. Along this band, the childis considered a thing, a possession.”Hubbard finished the book and wrote this dedication:ToAlexis Valerie HubbardFor Whose Tomorrow MayBe Hoped a World ThatIs Fit To Be FreeHubbard eventually wrote a note to Sara to explain his whereabouts, sayingthat he was in a Cuban military hospital, about to be transferred to the States“as a classiɹed scientist immune from interference of all kinds.” He adds, “I willbe hospitalized probably a long time. Alexis is getting excellent care. I see herevery day. She is all I have to live for. My wits never gave way under all youdid and let them do but my body didn’t stand up. My right side is paralyzed.... Ihope my heart lasts.... Dianetics will last 10,000 years—for the Army and Navyhave it now.” He concludes by warning that in the event of his death, Alexis willinherit a fortune, but if Sara gains custody, the child will get nothing.Hubbard did return to the United States and hunkered down in Wichita,Kansas, where a wealthy supporter, Don Purcell, provided him sanctuary.Hubbard’s old friend Russell Hays was there, consulting for the Cessna AircraftCorporation. Hubbard arrived with “a Cadillac so damn long he couldn’t hardlypark it anywhere, and two concubines,” Hays marveled. When Sara discoveredwhere her husband was, she sought to enjoin his assets. Hubbard retaliated bywriting a letter to the US attorney general, explaining the peril he was in. “I am,basically, a scientist in the ɹeld of atomic and molecular phenomena,” he saidby way of introduction. He said that his own investigation showed that Sara wastied to Communists who had inɹltrated the Dianetics Foundation. This was atthe height of McCarthyism and the Red Scare. “I did not realize my wife wasone until this spring,” Hubbard wrote. He named several of his disaʃectedfollowers, including Gregory Hemingway, son of the famous novelist. “When,when, when will we have a round-up?” he implored.Meantime, Sara came to Wichita to pursue the divorce and to get Alexis back."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Ron blithely suggested that they should take a trip together. “He told me that Iwas under the inɻuence of this communist cell” run by her husband, Sararecalled. “And that they were dictating to me what to do, and that I was in astate of complete madness. I told him, ‘Yep, I think you’re right. The only thingI can do is to work through it and do whatever they say.’ ” Ron replied that theCommunists had hypnotized her. Sara played along, but insisted she would haveto go through the divorce; only then would she be able to break free of theirpower.“You know, I’m a public ɹgure and you’re nobody,” Ron said, “so if you haveto go through the divorce, I’ll accuse you of desertion so it won’t look so bad onmy public record.” As long as she was going to get Alexis back as part of thebargain, Sara agreed.Sara Northrup Hubbard in April 1951, when she was suing Hubbard for the return of their baby daughter, AlexisOn the day of the divorce, Ron was convinced that the spell the Communistshad cast over Sara would be broken, and she would come back to him.

Sara said thatthe last thing she had to do was go to the airport. She already had a ticket.

He told her that he couldn’t stand the idea that she wouldbe under the inɻuence of psychiatrists, and that he might never see either ofthem again. “I’m not going to let you go,” he said.“I got out of the car, it was on the edge of the airɹeld,” Sara remembered. “Ileft all Alexi’s clothes in the car, I left my suitcase, one of her shoes fell oʃ and Ihad my purse. I just ran across the airɹeld, across the runways, to the airportand got on the plane. And it was the nineteenth of June and it was the happiestday of my life.”IN THE SPACE of a year, Hubbard had gone from destitution and obscurity to greatwealth and international renown, followed by a crashing descent. Thefoundation he had created to train auditors plummeted into debt and soondeclared bankruptcy. Close supporters, such as John Campbell and Dr. Winter,deserted. Dianetics proved to be a fad that had swept the country, infatuatingtens or even hundreds of thousands of people, but then burned itself out morequickly than the hula hoop.Once again, Hubbard got a house trailer, and this time he drove it toLawrence, Kansas, where Russell Hays now lived. Hays instructed Hubbard topark his trailer on some raw land he owned nearby. “That didn’t please him,”Hays said. “I wouldn’t want to have to live with him, he’d get on my nerves.”Hubbard was drinking and had a number of drugs along with him, and hepressed Hays to supply him with marijuana. Hays later dried some horseweedand mailed it to Hubbard, signing the letter, “I. M. Reefer.”Hays advised the discouraged Hubbard to make use of his extensive mailinglist. There were many followers who still believed in the man and his method.Some had had meaningful emotional breakthroughs. Others had experiences—such as leaving their bodies—that conclusively proved to them the validity ofHubbard’s claims. These acolytes provided the bedrock of support that Hubbard"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"needed to regenerate his broken organization, rebuild his ɹnances, and repairthe stain on his reputation caused by his personal scandals.In addition to Hubbard’s relentless self-conɹdence, several new factorssalvaged his movement. He had a new device, the E-Meter, developed by one ofhis followers, which Hubbard revealed in March 1952. The E-Meter wouldreplace the Dianetic reverie with what appeared to be a more scientiɹcapproach, one that didn’t look so much like a hypnotic trance. “It sees all,knows all,” Hubbard declared. “It is never wrong.” And he had a new wife,Mary Sue Whipp, a petite Texan, twenty years his junior, whom he married thatsame month. She was already pregnant with the first of their four children.Hubbard also had a new name for his movement. From now on, it wasScientology.1 According to the church, “There was something under the water and it was deɹnitely hostile, and afterthey dropped their charges, there was oil and something sunk.... It definitely happened.”2 A conspicuous example of Dianetic processing involved John Brodie, the outstanding quarterback for theSan Francisco 49ers, who suʃered an injury to his throwing arm in 1970 that threatened to end his career.Despite the best medical attention and physical therapy, his elbow remained sore and swollen. Finally, hewent to Phil Spickler, a Scientologist and Dianetic auditor, who asked Brodie to tell him about previousincidents that might be keeping his arm from healing. Brodie related that he had been in a severe traɽcaccident in 1963, in which his arm had been broken. As he explored the incident with Spickler, Brodieseemed to recall one of the ambulance attendants saying, “Well, that poor sonofabitch will never throw afootball again.” And yet Brodie was unconscious at the time. How could he have such a memory? Spicklertold him this was all part of an engram that was keeping him from getting well. “The ambulanceattendant’s prediction had been simmering in my unconscious for seven years, agitating all my deepestfears of declining ability or failure,” Brodie later writes. “It had ɹnally surfaced as this psychosomaticailment in my throwing arm. Phil made me tell the story again and again and again, until no chargeshowed on the E-Meter” (John Brodie and James D. Houston, Open Field, p. 166). The swelling on Brodie’sarm diminished. He went on to have one of the greatest seasons of his career, and was voted the NationalFootball League’s most valuable player that year."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"G3Going Overboardiven his biography, it would be easy to dismiss Hubbard as a fraud, butthat would fail to explain his total absorption in his project. He wouldspend the rest of his life elaborating his theory and—even moreobsessively—constructing the intricate bureaucracy designed to spread andenshrine his visionary understanding of human behavior. His life narroweddown to his singular mission. Each passageway in his interior expedition led himdeeper into his imagination. That journey became Scientology, a totalisticuniverse in which his every turn was mapped and described.Hubbard’s own logic was inclining him toward conclusions that he was at ɹrstreluctant to draw. By admitting the validity of prenatal memories, he was boundto confront a dilemma: What if the memories didn’t stop there? When patientsbegan having “sperm dreams,” Hubbard had to accept the idea that prenatalengrams were recorded “as early as shortly before conception.” Then, whenpatients began to remember previous lives, Hubbard resisted the idea; itthreatened to tear apart his organization. “The subject of past deaths and pastlives is so full of tension that as early as last July 1950, the board of trustees ofthe [Dianetics] Foundation sought to pass a resolution banning the entiresubject,” he conɹded. Still, the implications were intriguing. What if we havelived before? Might there be memories that occasionally leak through intopresent time? Wouldn’t that prove that we are immortal beings, onlytemporarily residing in our present incarnations?Instead of remembering, the patient undergoing Dianetic counseling “returns”to the past-life event. “There is a diʃerent feel to another period in time that’sso basic it’s hard to describe,” Hubbard’s top US executive, Helen O’Brien,recalled. “If you ɹnd yourself in a room, there may be color with unfamiliartones because of gaslight shining on it. The air has a strange quality. Its particlesof dust derive from unmodern constituents. Even human bodies seem to radiatea diʃerent kind of warmth when they are covered with the fabrics of anotherage. Memory, per se, ɹlters out all that. When you return, you ɹnd the pastintact.” Some of the “returnings” were shocking or painful. O’Brien’s ɹrst past-life experience in an auditing session was that of being a young Irish woman in"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"the early nineteenth century. She could feel the coarse texture of her full-skirteddress as she walked down a narrow country lane, hearing the birds and feelingthe warm country air. But when she turned a corner of her house, she saw aBritish soldier bayoneting her fourteen-year-old son in the yard. “I literallyshuddered with grief,” O’Brien writes. When the soldier threw her to the groundand tried to rape her, she spit in his face. He crushed her skull with acobblestone. O’Brien’s auditor had her re-experience the scene over and overuntil she was able to move through the entire bloody tableau unaʃected. “Bythe end of it, I was luxuriously comfortable in every ɹbre,” she writes. “When Iwalked downstairs ... the electric lights dazzled me. The clean modern lines ofthe house interior, and the furniture, were elegant and strange to me beyond alldescription. I was freshly there from another age. For the ɹrst time in thislifetime, I knew I was beyond the laws of space and time.“I was never the same again.”With his new acceptance of past-life experiences, Hubbard could now describethe individual as being divisible into three parts. First there was the spirit, orsoul, which Hubbard calls the thetan. The thetan normally lives in or near abody but can also be entirely separate from it. When a person goes exterior, forinstance, it is the thetan part of him that travels outside the body or viewshimself from across the room. The mind, which serves mainly as a storehouse ofpictures, functions as a communication and control system for the thetan,helping him operate in his environment. The body is merely the physicalcomposition of the person, existing in space and time.Anyone who stands in the way of a thetan’s spiritual progress is a SuppressivePerson (SP). This is a key concept in Scientology. Hubbard uses the term todescribe a sociopath. The Suppressive instinctively ɹghts against constructiveforces and is driven berserk by those who try to help others. Hubbard estimatesthat Suppressives constitute about twenty percent of the population, but onlyabout two and a half percent are truly dangerous. “A Suppressive Person willgoof up or vilify any eʃort to help anybody and particularly knife with violenceanything calculated to make human beings more powerful or more intelligent,”Hubbard writes. “The artist in particular is often found as a magnet for personswith anti-social personalities who see in his art something which must bedestroyed.”Naturally, anyone who is close to a Suppressive Person is in great danger offalling under his inɻuence. Hubbard called that person a Potential TroubleSource. If, for instance, a parent opposes a child who wants to join Scientology,that parent is likely to be declared an SP; and as long as the child remains in"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"contact with the parent, he is in danger of being deɹned as a PTS. He will bedenied auditing and training. Eventually, the child will have to make a choice,either to leave the church—which oʃers him a path to career success, personalimprovement, and salvation—or to disconnect from his parent, who is the causeof his failure to achieve happiness and realize his dreams.Hubbard had learned some diɽcult lessons from his experience withDianetics. He was by nature an autocrat, but his work beckoned to amateurs.The movement inspired by his book had sprung up so quickly there was no realchance to rein it in and exert the kind of authority that might have made it moredurable. Although he tried to impose order by creating professional trainingschools for auditors, in truth he had more or less surrendered control of themovement from the moment of inception by empowering his readers to becomepractitioners themselves; all they had to do was to follow the formulas sketchedin his book. Entrepreneurs grabbed hold of the concept and snatched it out of hishands. They spread the message, but they also diluted it. When the Dianeticsmovement subsided, Hubbard was unable to restore the momentum that hadgiven it such a rocket-powered launch. Imitators and competitors came onto theɹeld, some even rivaling Hubbard himself. He was determined not to make thesame mistakes with Scientology. From now on, he would exercise total control.His word was law. He was not just the founder, he was “Source”—the last word,whose every pronouncement was scripture.In the evolution of Dianetics to Scientology, however, there was a largerwheel turning inside Hubbard’s protean imagination. Until now, religion hadplayed little or no part in his life or his thought—except, perhaps, as it wasreɻected in the cynical remark he is reported to have made on a number ofoccasions, “I’d like to start a religion. That’s where the money is.” One of theproblems with Dianetics, from a moneymaking perspective, was the lack of along-term association on the part of its adherents. Psychotherapy has atheoretical conclusion to it; the patient is “cured” or decides that the proceduredoesn’t work for him. In either case, the revenue dries up. Religion solves thatproblem. In addition to tax advantages, religion supplies a commodity that isalways in demand: salvation. Hubbard ingeniously developed Scientology into aseries of veiled revelations, each of which promised greater abilities andincreased spiritual power. “To keep a person on the Scientology path,” Hubbardonce told one of his associates, “feed him a mystery sandwich.”It may be true that his decision to take his movement in a new direction hadmore to do with the legal and tax advantages that accrue to religiousorganizations than it did with actual spiritual inspiration. He was desperate for"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"money. The branches of his Dianetics Foundation were shuttered, one afteranother. At one point, Hubbard even lost the rights to the name Dianetics. Thetrend for his movement was toward disaster.A letter Hubbard wrote to one of his executives in 1953 shows him weighingthe advantages of setting up a new organization. “Perhaps we could call it aSpiritual Guidance Center,” he speculates. “And we could put in nice desks andour boys in neat blue with diplomas on the walls and 1. knock psychotherapyinto history and 2. make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3.keep the HAS [Hubbard Association of Scientologists] solvent. It is a problem ofpractical business.“I await your reaction on the religion angle.”In the anti-Scientology narrative, this is one of several clear statements ofHubbard’s calculations and proof that the “church” was nothing more than amoneymaking front. But Hubbard follows this with the observation, “We’retreating present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain.And brother, that’s religion, not mental science.” At the end of that year,Hubbard incorporated three diʃerent churches: the Church of American Science,the Church of Spiritual Engineering, and the eventual winner in the brand-namecontest, the Church of Scientology. The Church of Scientology of California wasestablished on February 18, 1954, quickly followed by another in Washington,DC.The ɹelds of psychotherapy and religion have bled into each other on manyoccasions. They have in common the goal of reshaping one’s view of the worldand letting go of, or actually renouncing, one’s previous stance.1 Hubbard saidthere were “many, many reasons” to ally Scientology with religion. “To somethis seems mere opportunism,” he later admitted to a reporter. “To some itwould seem that Scientology is simply making itself bulletproof in the eyes ofthe law.”Among the many other incentives to turn Hubbard’s movement into a religion,there is one that might be considered especially in light of the frequent chargethat he was insane. Religion is always an irrational enterprise, no matter howennobling it may be to the human spirit. In many cultures, people who might beconsidered mentally ill in Western societies are thought of as religious healers,or shamans. Anthropologists have called schizophrenia the “shaman sickness,”because part of a shaman’s traditional journey requires suʃering an illness thatcannot be cured except by spiritual means. The shaman uses the powers andinsights he gains from his experience to heal his community. This is exactly thehistory that Hubbard paints as his own: a blind cripple in the Navy hospital,"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"given up for lost, who then heals himself through techniques he reɹnes intoDianetics. This is the gift he humbly oʃers as a means of healing humanity. “Thegoal of Dianetics is a sane world—a world without insanity, without criminalsand without war,” he declares. “It can be stopped only by the insane.”For both the shaman and the schizophrenic, the boundaries between realityand illusion are soft, and consciousness slips easily from one to the other.Hubbard, with his highly imaginative mind, certainly had immediate access tovisionary worlds; his science-ɹction stories are evidence of that. But it is adiʃerent matter to be able to cast the nets of one’s imagination into theunconscious and pull out best-selling books. The schizophrenic is rarely soproductive in the material world.Sometimes in Hubbard’s writings, however, he puts forward what appear tobe fantasies of a highly schizophrenic personality. In 1952, for instance, hebegan talking about “injected entities,” which can paralyze portions of theanatomy or block information from being audited. These entities can be locatedin the body, always in the same places. For instance, one of the entities, the“crew chief,” is found on the right side of the jaw down to the shoulder. “Theyare the ‘mysterious voices’ in the heads of some preclears,” Hubbard said.“Paralysis, anxiety stomachs, arthritis and many ills and aberrations have beenrelieved by auditing them. An E-Meter shows them up and makes them confesstheir misdeeds. They are probably just compartments of the mind which, cut oʃ,begin to act as though they were persons.”Hubbard says there are actually two separate genetic lines that, in the historyof evolution, ɹrst came together in the mollusk, but have been contending fordominance ever since, even in human beings. “In the bivalve state, one ɹndsthem at war with each other in an eʃort to attain sole command of the entirebivalve,” Hubbard writes. This primordial contest manifests itself in higherforms of life in such things as right- and left-handedness. “Your discussion ofthese incidents with the uninitiated in Scientology can produce havoc,” Hubbardwarns. “Should you describe the ‘Clam’ to someone, you may restimulate him tothe point of causing severe jaw hinge pain. One such victim, after hearing abouta clam death, could not use his jaws for three days.”HUBBARD’S THIRD WIFE was smart and poised, a decorous partner for him. She wasso slight and weightless that it might be easy to overlook her, but her Southernmanners and Texas accent concealed a hard and determined nature. Unlike Saraor Polly, Mary Sue was a true believer, a natural enforcer. One of Hubbard’s"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"executives later described her as “pragmatic, cold, cunning, calculating, efficient,and ɹercely loyal.” She had ɻinty blue eyes, a sharp, prominent nose, and a rarelopsided smile that would expose her uneven, slightly crossed front teeth.Mary Sue and Ron with Diana, Quentin, Arthur, and SuzetteRon and Mary Sue, with their burgeoning family, began a restless search for anew home—for themselves and for the international headquarters of the church.In 1955, they moved to Washington, DC, but they stayed only a few monthsbefore moving to London. Less than two years later, they were back inWashington, living in a digniɹed brownstone near Dupont Circle, across thestreet from the Academy of Scientology. Hubbard was prospering once again,with mounting commissions from the sale of E-Meters and training processes,and royalties from sixty books in print. In 1956, his salary from the church wasonly ɹve hundred dollars a month; but the following year, the church beganpaying him a percentage of its gross profits, and his income took a gigantic leap.In Washington, Hubbard set up visiting hours from four to six everyafternoon, and made a point of warning the pilgrims who trod the path to hisdoor not to mistake him for a god or a guru, “so knock oʃ the idolizing.” Andyet he couldn’t resist exaggerating his status. Identifying himself as a nuclearphysicist, Hubbard published a book in 1957, All About Radiation, in which hepromoted a formula he called Dianazene, a mixture of nicotinic acid and"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"vitamins, that was supposed to cure cancer as well as sunburns. “It should betaken daily,” he recommended, “with milk and chocolate.”Ron and Mary Sue had four children in six years. Diana, born in 1952, was theeldest and clearly the dominant one. She had her father’s red hair and agenerous splattering of freckles. Quentin, born two years later, was the only onewho was not a radiant redhead; he was small with ash-blond hair, like MarySue, and would always be his mother’s favorite. Suzette was a year younger; shewas a cheerful child, but somewhat overshadowed by her big sister. The baby,Arthur, was born in 1958. Seen together, the Hubbard family made a vividimpression, with their ruddy complexions and their striking hair color.Although the children had a nanny, they spent much of their timeunsupervised. School was an afterthought; it wasn’t until Diana demanded tolearn how to write her name that the children began their education. Mary Suewas a chilly presence as a mother; she rarely cuddled or even touched herchildren, but in the early years she would read to them—Mary Poppins, Winniethe Pooh, and Kipling’s stories—in her slight Texas twang. As she took onadditional responsibility in Scientology, she became even more removed; butRon would hug the kids and toss them in the air. The house echoed with hisbooming laugh. He taught the children how to play “Chopsticks” on the pianoand showed them card tricks with his quick hands and perfectly manicuredɹngernails. He would play records and dance with the children to Beethoven orRavel or Edvard Grieg’s Peer Gynt Suite—bold, soaring music. He liked to sing,and he would burst into “Farewell and Adieu to You Fair Spanish Ladies,” and“Be Kind to Your Web-Footed Friends,” a children’s song that is sung to the tuneof “The Stars and Stripes Forever.” He was fanatical about taking vitamins, andhe made sure the children took theirs, as well. Afterward, they would all roar tosee who was the strongest.Hubbard was restless in Washington, and in 1959 he moved his family back toEngland, to a luxurious estate in Sussex called Saint Hill Manor, which hepurchased from the Maharajah of Jaipur. Hubbard employed an extensivehousehold staʃ, including two butlers, a housekeeper, a nanny, a tutor for thechildren, a chauʃeur, and maintenance workers for the estate. “Dr.” Hubbardpresented himself to the curious British press as an experimental horticulturalscientist; to prove it, he allowed a photograph to be published of himself staringintently at a tomato that was attached to an E-Meter. The headline in GardenNews was “Plants Do Worry and Feel Pain.”"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Hubbard using the E-Meter on a tomato in 1968 to test whether it experiences painThe grand mansion was a terriɹc playground for the children. It was actuallya U-shaped castle with crenelated rooɻines, ivy-covered walls, and rumors ofghosts. There were ɹfty-two rolling acres to play in, with rose gardens, goldɹshponds, and a lake. The house itself had sweeping staircases, elevators, and evensecret rooms where the children could hide from the nanny. The children alsoprowled through their mother’s closet. Left to herself, Mary Sue was anindiʃerent dresser, but Ron brought tailors from London carrying gorgeous boltsof cloth, and racks of clothing brought in from the top department stores, all inMary Sue’s size. Her closet was full of sparkling gowns and shimmering dresses.Trim and regal by nature, Mary Sue was a wonderful model, but she really onlydressed for him.Hubbard’s third-ɻoor research room was the enticing inner sanctum; it waspainted royal blue, with a bear rug in front of the ɹreplace, and a privatebathroom that was redolent of the Spanish sandalwood soap he favored.Hubbard would disappear into his oɽce every day for hours and hours, alonewith his E-Meter, “mapping out the bank and looking for the next undercut,” ashe explained, meaning that he was trying to inventory the reactive mind and"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"discover a path through its many snares.School was, as usual, a secondary consideration. The children would take ataxi to class, when they actually went. Their father didn’t really believe inpublic education, so he didn’t pressure them. Sometimes, they had a tutor, but itwas Diana who taught Suzette how to read. She didn’t want Suzette to suʃer thesame embarrassment she had when she started school so far behind her peers.By the age of nine, Suzette was reading adult literature. She decided she wantedto be a writer, like her father. Quentin developed an obsession with airplanes,and he would often persuade the nanny or the chauʃeur to take him to GatwickAirport instead of to class, so he could watch the various aircraft taking oʃ andlanding. He loved to stand near the runway with the heavy planes lumberingjust overhead. He was soon able to close his eyes and identify the make of theplane strictly by its sound.Hubbard at Saint Hill Manor in 1959 showing an E-Meter to his children, Quentin, Diana, Suzette, and ArthurIn school, other children would ask the older Hubbard kids about their fatherand what was going on in the castle.

One day, Diana, Quentin, and Suzette marched into Hubbard’s oɽce anddemanded, “What is this ‘Scientology’?” Hubbard put them all on a starter"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"Dianetics course.Scientology was in its formative stage, still unfurling from Hubbard’simaginative mind. This was a volatile moment in Hubbard’s life and thedevelopment of his movement. The fervent response of so many to hisrevelations must have added reality and substance to what otherwise might haveseemed mere fantasies. Not only was he inventing a new religion, he was alsoreinventing himself as a religious leader. He was creating the legend of who hewas in the minds of those who believed in him. And inevitably, he becameimprisoned by their expectations.His followers lived in a state of constant anticipation, trading legends amongthemselves about the marvels they had experienced or heard about, andspeculating upon what was to come. Moments of magic and transcendence keptreason at bay. Ken Urquhart, who served as Hubbard’s butler and later as hissecretary—or “Communicator”—recalls coaching a “little old English lady” on aScientology training exercise. As he observed her, “I noticed her nice skin, hereyes, eyebrows. I noted that behind the skin on her forehead was the bone ofher forehead, and I knew that behind that lay her brain. As I thought thatthought, her forehead absolutely disappeared. I was looking directly at herbrain. I was ɹrst astounded and then quickly horriɹed. Here I was exposing herbrain to germs and the cold. At once her forehead was back in place.”If Scientology really did bestow enhanced powers upon its adherents, Hubbardhimself—of all people—should be able to exercise them. Hubbard’s frailtieswere obvious to everyone; among other things, his hands shook from palsy andhe was hard of hearing, constantly exclaiming, “What? What?” He sensed thepresumptions that surrounded him. “Your friends,” he said one day to Urquhartas his bath was being prepared, “might be curious as to why I employ somebodyto open the shutters in my room when I can do it myself.” He meant that heshould be able, by sheer mental power, to project his intention and the shutterswould open themselves. “Well, a lot of people would like me to appear in thesky over New York so as to impress the world. But if I were to do that I’doverwhelm a lot of people. I’m not here to overwhelm.” Urquhart thought ofsaying that he was perfectly willing to be overwhelmed in order to see such ademonstration, but he wasn’t altogether sure that Hubbard could actually do it.The failure of Hubbard’s followers to challenge him made them complicit in thecreation of the mythical ɹgure that he became. They conspired to protect theimage of L. Ron Hubbard, the prophet, the revelator, and the friend of mankind.On the other hand, there were moments when Hubbard seemed to be toyingwith the limits of possibility. It was rumored that he could move the clouds"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"around in the sky or stir up dust devils in his wake. Urquhart remembers a timewhen Hubbard was talking to him while sitting in a chair more than an arm’slength away. “My attention wandered,” he recalled. Suddenly, he felt a ɹngerpoking him in the ribs. “I came back. He was talking away, grinning and eyestwinkling. He had not moved his arms or gotten up from the chair.” Suchineʃable experiences seemed to add up to something, although it was not clearwhat that might be.Hubbard’s neighbors soon learned more about the new lord of the manor.Scientology’s expansion, coupled with the increasingly bold claims that Hubbardmade about the health beneɹts that could be expected, brought the organizationunder scrutiny by various governments. The first blow was a 1963 raid by USMarshals, acting on a warrant issued by the Food and Drug Administration toseize more than a hundred E-Meters stored in the Washington church. The FDAcharged that the labeling for the E-Meter suggested that it was eʃective indiagnosing and treating “all mental and nervous disorders and illnesses,” as wellas “psychosomatic ailments of mankind such as arthritis, cancer, stomach ulcers,and radiation burns from atomic bombs, poliomyelitis, the common cold, etc.”2The IRS began an audit that would strip the church of its religious taxexemption in 1967. At the same time, an Australian government board ofinquiry produced a sweeping report that was passionate in its condemnation.“There are some features of Scientology which are so ludicrous that there maybe a tendency to regard Scientology as silly and its practitioners as harmlesscranks. To do so would be gravely to misunderstand the tenor of the Board’sconclusions,” the report began, then emphatically added: “Scientology is evil, itstechniques evil, its practice a serious threat to the community, medically, morallyand socially; and its adherents sadly deluded and often mentally ill.” The reportadmitted that there were “transient gains” realized by some of the religion’sadherents, but said that the organization plays on those gains in order toproduce “a subservience amounting almost to mental enslavement.” As forHubbard himself, the board described him as “a man of restless energy” who is“constantly experimenting and speculating, and equally constantly he confusesthe two.” “Some of his claims are that ... he has been up in the Van Allen Belt,that he has been on the planet Venus where he inspected an implant station, andthat he has been to Heaven. He even recommends a protein formula for feedingnon-breast fed babies—a mixture of boiled barley and corn syrup—stating thathe ‘picked it up in Roman days.’ ” Although Hubbard has “an insensate hostility”to psychiatrists and people in the ɹeld of mental health, the report noted, he ishimself “mentally abnormal,” evincing a “persecution complex” and “an"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"imposing aggregation of symptoms which, in psychiatric circles, are stronglyindicative of a condition of paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of grandeur—symptoms common to dictators.” The report led to a ban of Scientology in twoAustralian states,3 and prompted similar inquiries in New Zealand, Britain, andSouth Africa. Hubbard believed that the US Food and Drug Administration, alongwith the FBI and CIA, were feeding slanderous information about the church tovarious governments.In the midst of all this upheaval, in February 1966 Hubbard ɹnally declaredanother “ɹrst Clear.” This time it was John McMaster, a dapper, blond SouthAfrican, in his mid-thirties, who was the director of the Hubbard GuidanceCenter at the church’s Saint Hill headquarters. Charming, ascetic, and well-spoken, McMaster had dropped out of medical school to become an auditor. Heimmediately proved to be a far more urbane representative of Scientology thanHubbard. His wry manner made him a welcome guest on talk shows and on thelecture circuit, where he portrayed Scientology as a cool and nonthreateningroute to self-realization. Suddenly the idea of going Clear began to catch on.McMaster adopted a clerical outɹt that beɹtted his designation as the church’sunoɽcial ambassador to the United Nations. At one point, Hubbard designatedhim Scientology’s ɹrst “pope.” It was a matter of puzzlement to Hubbard’sclosest associates, given Hubbard’s disparagement of homosexuals in his books,that he would enlist a person to serve as the church’s representative who wasobviously gay. “He was very pronounced in his aʃect,” one of Hubbard’smedical oɽcers remembered. But Hubbard’s relationship to homosexuality wasapparently more complicated in life than in theory.CONVINCED THAT the British, American, and Soviet governments were interested ingaining control of Scientology’s secrets in order to use them for evil intentions,Hubbard began looking for a safe harbor—ideally, a country that he could ruleover. England had taken steps to “curb the growth” of Scientology, and Hubbardtook the hint. He also suʃered from the damp weather. “I had been ill withpneumonia for the third time in England and on the suggestion of my doctor wasseeking a warmer climate for a short while in order to recover,” he said, in anunprompted explanation to the CIA. He resigned as Executive Director of theChurch of Scientology and sold his interests in the Hubbard Association ofScientologists International, although he maintained actual control of theorganization through his innumerable telexes. He journeyed to Rhodesia, theSouth African republic that had recently declared its independence from the"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"United Kingdom (it later became Zimbabwe). Isolated, diplomatically spurned,and subject to international sanctions, the Rhodesian government served a cliqueof white colonists who ruled over an insurgent black majority. To Hubbard,Rhodesia seemed ripe for a takeover. He felt a kinship with the republic’sdashing and ɻamboyant founder, Cecil John Rhodes, who also had red hair anda taste for swashbuckling adventure. Hubbard believed he might have beenRhodes in a previous life, although it’s unclear whether he knew that Rhodeswas homosexual.Hubbard had a fantasy that he would be welcomed in Rhodesia, that the blackpopulation would embrace him like a brother, and that eventually he wouldbecome its leader, issuing passports and his own currency. However, the currentprime minister, Ian Smith, was desperately trying to negotiate a settlement withthe black nationalist movement that would preserve white-minority rule.Hubbard thoughtfully wrote up a constitution for the government that heclaimed would accomplish just that, but he couldn’t get anyone to take itseriously.While Hubbard talked about his big plans for developing the country, thegovernment became increasingly suspicious of his motives and his resources.Ultimately, Hubbard’s visa was not renewed. “He told me Ian Smith was goingto be shot because he was a ‘Suppressive,’ ” John McMaster said. “The realreason that Hubbard was kicked out of Rhodesia was that his cheques bounced.”Hubbard returned to England with a new scheme. If the world’s governmentswere lining up against him, he would put himself beyond reach. Scientologistswere whispering about a clandestine “sea project” that their leader wasplanning. He quietly began acquiring a small ɻeet of oceangoing vessels. Thenhe disappeared again.This time, he went to Tangier, the Moroccan city on the Strait of Gibraltar,which was a famous hangout for hipsters and artists. There he began hisresearch on Operating Thetan Level Three (OT III), his “Wall of Fire.” Mary Sueand the children remained in England, but Hubbard wrote to her daily,complaining of a barking dog that was interrupting his work, and variousailments—a bad back, and a lung problem that emerged from a lingering cold.He admitted that he was “drinking lots of rum” and taking drugs—“pinks andgrays”—while he was doing his research. He would sign oʃ on the letters, “YourSugie.” Hubbard stayed only a month in Tangier before moving to Las Palmas inthe Canary Islands, where one of his followers found him deeply depressed andsurrounded by pills of all kinds. “I want to die,” he said. Alarmed, Mary Sueflew down to take care of him."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"In September 1967, Hubbard made a recording for his followers to explain hisabsence and inform them of important discoveries in his OT III research. “Allthis recent career has been relatively hard on this poor body,” he relates. “I’vebroken its back, broken its knee, and now I have a broken arm, because of thestrenuousness of these particular adventures. One wonders then, well, if he is insuch good shape what is he doing breaking up his body? Well, that is thetrouble. I have great difficulty getting down to the small power level of a body.”He also notes that he had directed Mary Sue to ɹnd out who was behind theattacks on Scientology that were turning the governments against theorganization. Mary Sue had hired “several professional intelligence agents,” whouncovered a conspiracy. “Our enemies on this planet are less than twelve men,”Hubbard discloses. “They own and control newspaper chains and they are oddlyenough directors in all the mental health groups in the world.” Their plan was to“use mental health, which is to say psychiatric electric shock and prefrontallobotomy, to remove from their path any political dissenters.” For the ɹrst time,he openly talks about the Sea Organization, or Sea Org, an elite group whowould form the committed inner core of the religion, Hubbard’s disciples, aScientology clergy.HANA STRACHAN (now Hana Eltringham Whitɹeld) was one of the ɹrst youngrecruits admitted into the Sea Org. Her deranged and manipulative mother wasa follower of Helena Blavatsky, the nineteenth-century spiritualist who was thefounder of the Theosophical Society. When Hana was about ɹfteen, she learnedthat Blavatsky had prophesied a new race that would arise in the Americas inthe 1950s; Hana was under the impression that it would be led by a man withred hair.Hana escaped her traumatic family situation to become a nurse inJohannesburg, South Africa. A medical student there gave her a copy ofDianetics. It made immediate sense to her. She went to the local organizationand said she wanted to learn more. “There’s a course starting tonight,” she wastold. In the hallway of the oɽce Hana noticed a photograph of Hubbardstanding outside the Saint Hill headquarters. She was transɹxed by his red hair.This must be the man Blavatsky was talking about, she decided. “That sealed itfor me,” she said. She moved to Saint Hill and became Clear #60. For threeweeks she was in a state of euphoria, feeling slightly detached from herenvironment and her body. “This is who we were in eons past,” she thought. Shewas convinced that Hubbard was a returned savior who would bring all"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"humanity to an enlightened state.Slender and stately, Hana was one of the ɹrst thirty-ɹve Sea Org recruits. Themission of the Sea Org, according to the contract she signed, is “to get ETHICS INon this PLANET AND THE UNIVERSE.” She agreed to “subscribe to the discipline, moresand conditions of this group.... THEREFORE, I CONTRACT MYSELF TO THE SEAORGANIZATION FOR THE NEXT BILLION YEARS.”4Hana married another Sea Org member, an American named Guy Eltringham,but they were separated when Hubbard ordered her to Las Palmas, where hewas reɹtting an exhausted ɹshing trawler called the Avon River. The decks andthe hold were coated with decades of ɹsh oil that had to be scraped away.During the two months the Avon River was in dry dock, Hubbard would oftenlinger for dinner with his Sea Org crew, and afterward he would sit on the deckand regale them with stories. Hubbard’s depression had lifted and he seemedcompletely in control—relaxed and conɹdent, even jovial. The crew weremainly drinking Spanish wines, but Hubbard favored rum and Coke—an eighthof a glass of Coke and seven-eighths rum—one after another through theevening. The heavens seemed very close in the dark harbor. Hubbard wouldpoint to the sky and say, “That is where the Fifth Invaders came from. They’rethe bad guys, they’re the ones who put us here.” He said he could actually spottheir spaceships crossing in front of the stars, and he would salute them as theypassed overhead, just to let them know that they had been seen.During a session with her auditor, Hana revealed the story of MadameBlavatsky’s prophecy of the red-haired man. Soon afterward, Hubbard came upon deck and gave her an intense look. From that point on, she became hisfavorite. He appointed her the ɹrst female Sea Org lieutenant. That day, she hada photograph made of herself in her Sea Org uniform—white shirt, dark tie andjacket, with a lanyard over one shoulder. She is young and elegant, her blondhair pulled back in a ponytail. After that, she rose through the Sea Org rankswith astonishing speed, often wondering if the revelation about the red-hairedman was responsible for her rapid promotions.Hubbard would drive over from his villa in Las Palmas to inspect the work onthe Avon River. The lower holds of the ship were converted into oɽces andberthing spaces; new equipment—including radar and a gyrocompass—wereinstalled, the screw replaced, and the hydraulic system completely overhauled.The inexperienced Sea Org members did most of the work, although Spanishlaborers did the welding and sandblasting. Whenever Hubbard spottedsomething wrong, he would be instantly transformed from the jovial andavuncular ɹgure the crew adored into a raging, implacable tyrant. Hana, who"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"was serving as master-at-arms, would dread seeing the “Commodore”—asHubbard titled himself—arrive, since she felt responsible if anything wentwrong. One day, when the Spanish workmen were painting a rust coat on thehull of the ship, she spotted Hubbard walking across the beach with his chiefoɽcer and his ɹrst mate, smoking and chatting happily. Then he suddenlystopped. His eyes went into slits and he began bellowing, “The rollers! Therollers!” Puzzled, Hana leaned over the side of the ship, then saw what hadcaught Hubbard’s attention: tiny threads poking through the paint, which hadbeen left by the cheap rollers that the workmen were using. “As those threadsdecomposed, they would leave little apertures for seawater to leak behind therust coating,” she realized. “It destroyed the integrity of the entire rust coating,and that’s what Hubbard was screaming about as he lumbered toward the ship.And what amazed me was that he saw it at forty to sixty feet away from theship. Later on, I walked that distance from the ship to see if I could see thoselittle hairs coming out of the rust coat. There was no way I could see them. Thatadded to my feeling of wonder and mystique about Hubbard.”IN TRUTH, Hubbard had very poor eyesight. Before the war, both the NavalAcademy and the Naval Reserve had rejected him because of his vision, and allduring the war he wore glasses. In 1951, when he was being evaluated for amedical disability, his vision tested at 20/200 for each eye, correctable to 20/20with glasses, much the same as it had been before the war. The examiner noted,“Eyes tire easily, has worn all types of glasses but claims he sees just as wellwithout as with glasses.” Was that even possible? Eyesight does change over theyears, but Hubbard’s eyes were astigmatic—meaning they were more football-shaped than round—and not likely to have improved, certainly not dramatically.And yet many of Hubbard’s associates testify to his keen eyesight. Withoutglasses, Hubbard would have been legally blind; perhaps that’s what he wasreferring to when he said he had cured himself of blindness after the war. But,clearly his eye examination showed different results.Hubbard had written in Dianetics that the eyesight of a Clear graduallyimproves to optimum perception. And yet, he admitted elsewhere that his visionwas so bad in the postwar years that he could scarcely see his typewriter towrite. He wore glasses and early versions of contact lenses. Through the use ofDianetic processing, he says, his eyes began to change. Many noticed thatHubbard had a habit of squinting, which has the eʃect of pressing astigmaticeyeballs into a rounder shape, which might momentarily improve his vision. He"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"theorized that “astigmatism, a distortion of image, is only an anxiety to alter theimage.” One day, for instance, he was reading an American Medical Associationreport and couldn’t make it out at all. He thought he might have to resort tousing a magnifying glass. Then he realized that the reason he couldn’t read itwas that he wasn’t willing to confront what it said. “I threw it aside, picked up anovel and the print was perfect.”Hubbard would sometimes chastise members of his crew about theirdependence on eyeglasses, which he said were an admission of “overts”—transgressions against the group. One night as the ɻeet was sailing in theCaribbean, he looked at the young woman serving him dinner, Tracy Ekstrand,whose glasses were sliding down her nose in the tropical heat. “You’re doingyourself an aesthetic disservice,” he pronounced. She was mortiɹed and stoppedwearing glasses that night. Although she was still able to move from room toroom and serve meals, her vision remained quite blurred. Some weeks later, asHubbard was retiring for the night, he looked at her again. He held up his packof cigarettes a foot in front of her face and asked if she could read the boldcapital letters: “KOOL.” Flustered by the personal attention from theCommodore, Ekstrand mumbled the name of the cigarettes. “There’s been ashift!” he declared triumphantly, then went to bed. Ekstrand was shaken. “Iremained outside his door for some minutes, dumbfounded and unsure how toreact,” she recalled. “This time there was no question. He was wrong. He wasimagining improvement and success with Scientology where there had beennone.”All of Hubbard’s senses were painfully acute. Each day, every room heinhabited had to be dusted to the point that it would pass a white-glove test. Hewas fanatically clean but also hypersensitive to soap, so that his clothes had tobe rinsed up to ɹfteen times, and even then he would complain that he couldsmell the detergent. His chef had to switch from cooking on stainless steel toCorningware because Hubbard complained of the taste of metal in his food.These stories were traded among his disciples as more evidence of hissuperhuman powers of discernment.ACCORDING TO SEVERAL Sea Org members, while he was in Las Palmas, Hubbard fellin love with another woman—Yvonne Gillham, the ship’s public relationsoɽcer. (She would later go on to start the Celebrity Centre in Hollywood.) Shehad a wide smile, large hazel eyes, and a short pixie haircut, bearing aresemblance to Julie Andrews in The Sound of Music. Gillham combined a down-"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"to-earth personality with a touch of class that came from growing up in the highsociety of Queensland, Australia. Inevitably, Hubbard demanded that sheaccompany him on the high seas. Gillham had three young children at Saint Hill,and she had only joined the Sea Org on Hubbard’s pledge that they could staywith her, but Hubbard’s desire for her had become a prison, one that she wastoo loyal to escape.Yvonne Gillham in a head shot she used during her modeling career, circa 1952Hubbard was ɹfty-six years old in the fall of 1967, when he set sail with hisyouthful crew. There was no destination or purpose other than to wander.Hubbard was by now portly, ruddy-faced, and jowly; his swept-back, once-redhair had turned strawberry blond. His eyes, which have been described as blueor green by various observers, were actually gray, like seawater, casting an oddɻatness over his aspect. Two strong lines transected his face: a deep furrowbetween his eyebrows, matching the notch below his nose and the cleft in hischin, and his duckbill lips, which were his most prominent feature. Once aboard,he dressed in various naval uniforms beɹtting his self-appointed station asCommodore of the fleet, with lots of braid and crossed anchors on his cap.There were three ships in Hubbard’s navy. In addition to the Avon River, therewas a schooner called the Enchanter, and the 3,200-ton ɻagship, a ɻat-bottom"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"cattle ferry originally called the Royal Scotsman, which was renamed the RoyalScotman because of a clerical error in the registration. The smokestack wasemblazoned with the initials “LRH.”Hubbard spent most of his time in the air-conditioned captain’s cabin on thepromenade deck of the Royal Scotman, surrounded by windows to take in theocean vistas. He rarely drank on the ship, except perhaps to take the chill oʃ ona cold night on the bridge. Drugs were nowhere in evidence. His days werelargely solitary, passed in auditing himself and writing policy papers. His oɽceon the top deck was called the Research Room. It was behind a pair of highlypolished wooden doors with brass handles. The ɻoor was a bright red linoleumcovered with Oriental rugs; there was a massive mahogany desk and a hugemirror above a ɹreplace. Crew members passing by on the upper deck could seehim writing with his usual rapidity on foolscap, using a green pen for policybulletins and a red one for the “tech”—that is, his vast corpus of coursework andprocedures that comprised Scientology’s spiritual technology. His restless legwould be jiggling as his hand raced across the page, faultlessly, in handsome,legible script. For other writing, he turned back to his typewriter. “I think hewas doing automatic writing,” said Jim Dincalci, one of his medical oɽcers.“The pages would be ɻying. When he came out of it, he would blink his eyes, asif coming awake, and he did this thing with his lips, smacking.”Hubbard and Mary Sue would dine in his oɽce between eight and ten p.m.Sometime after three in the morning, Dincalci would give Hubbard a massageand he would go to sleep. After that, everyone on the ship had to be quiet untilHubbard awakened, sometime before noon, and remain absolutely mute whilehe was auditing himself on the E-Meter.In Hubbard’s opinion, the device operated just below the level of consciousawareness; it somehow knew what you were thinking before you did. It waseerily compelling. Anything that registered on the meter was seen as beingsigniɹcant. The trick was divining what the needle was saying. Sometimes thereaction was so violent that the needle would pound back and forth like aberserk windshield wiper—you could hear it snapping against the pins at eitherend. Hubbard called this a “rock slam.” Anyone who registered such a reactionwas deemed psychotic and certain to have committed crimes againstScientology; if that person was in the Sea Org, he would be punishedautomatically, the crime to be sorted out later.After initially resisting the concept of past lives, Hubbard became passionatelyinterested in the subject. “We Come Back” was the motto of the Sea Org.Hubbard began recalling many of his own previous existences, which the E-"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Meter validated. He claimed to have been a contemporary of Machiavelli’s, andhe was still upset that the author of The Prince stole his line “The end justiɹesthe means.” He said he had been a marshal to Joan of Arc and Tamburlaine’swife. He told stories about driving a race car in the alien Marcab civilizationmillions of years before. He came to believe that in some of his past lives onthis planet, he had buried treasure in various locations, so he launched anexpedition to unearth his ancient hoards. He called it the Mission into Time. Heselected a small crew to go on the Avon River. Because he wanted to keep themission secret, he had two long rafts fashioned, which could be rowed ashoreunder cover of darkness and pulled up on the beach near where he imagined hisancient treasure was buried. When Hana Eltringham saw she wasn’t on the list,she wrote Hubbard, pleading to be included, saying she would be willing toperform any duty. To her surprise, Hubbard appointed her chief officer.One very dark, overcast night in 1968, the Avon River dropped anchor on thewestern coast of Sicily, in the bay of Castellammare del Golfo, beside a steeppromontory topped by an ancient watchtower. Hubbard gave his “missionaires”a treasure map he had drawn up based on his past-life recollections. The crewset out in one of the rafts toward the rocky shoreline, lugging ropes, shovels,and metal detectors. Giggling and tripping over each other, they scrambled up aten-foot cliʃ. It was so dark they couldn’t see more than a foot in front of theirfaces. Each had a hand on another’s shoulder as they picked their way throughstands of cactus along the rocky outcropping. At one point, the leader of theexpedition bumped into a cow. The cow started mooing, then a dog barked, anda light went on in a house nearby. Everyone stood dead still until the scenequieted down. Finally, the clouds parted enough for the moon to shine through.The missionaires found some old bricks they thought might have been the ruinsof a castle beside the watchtower. The metal detectors found nothing.Hubbard decided to come along the next day to inspect the site himself. “Yes,yes, this is the place!” he said excitedly. He explained the absence of treasure bysaying that it must have been hidden in a portion of the ruined castle that hadfallen into the sea.The expedition moved on to Sardinia, where Hubbard claimed to have had anaʃair with the priestess in a temple—“liaisons in the moonlight,” he told hisenchanted missionaires—when he was a Carthaginian sailor. “We had a lot ofgood-looking girls in Carthage but they didn’t come up to her.” The Avon Rivernext stopped in Calabria, on the toe of Italy, where Hubbard had buried gold inhis days as a tax collector in the Roman Empire. None was found, however.Near Tunis, where the missionaires hoped to dive on the ruins of an ancient"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"underwater city, Hubbard found fault with the captain of the Avon River, Joevan Staden, and booted him oʃ the ship. Eltringham was sitting at her desk onthe ’tween deck when Hubbard called her into his oɽce and told her she wasthe new captain of the four-hundred-ton trawler, starting in the morning.Eltringham went back to her desk and put her head in her hands. She wastwenty-six years old. Everything she knew about sailing she had learned fromHubbard. To his credit, he had been a good teacher. He had taken a dozenmembers of the original Sea Org crew and taught them the semaphore code,how to navigate using a sextant, and basic laws of the sea. But she knew nothingabout running the engine room, or operating the electronics on the bridge, ordocking a ship. Half an hour later, Hubbard stuck his head out of his oɽce andbeckoned to her. He was holding an E-Meter. Standing in the doorway whereeveryone could see them, Hubbard handed her the cans. Then he screwed up hiseyes and demanded, “Recall a time you were last a captain.” As Eltringhamclosed her eyes and began to free-associate, Hubbard watched the needle on theE-Meter.“What’s that?” he asked, when the needle suddenly dropped.“That was sometime on a ship somewhere and the ship was sinking,”Eltringham responded.“Okay, go back earlier.” A moment later, he asked her again, “What’s that?”“That’s just a lot of confusion. I’m in a cabin with a lot of other people.Something urgent is going on.”Hubbard asked her to talk more about it. Eltringham began to see the incidentmore clearly. “We were in some kind of spaceship,” she said. “We were underattack and—oh my God!—I can see a planet down there! And the planet’s onɹre! And something is shooting at us and—oh my God!—the spaceshipexploded!”Hubbard asked her to tell the story several more times to destimulate theincident. Then he asked Eltringham how she was feeling.“I’m fine, sir.”Hubbard screwed up his eyes again. “Do you have any other thoughts aboutit?” Eltringham realized that he was looking for a ɻoating needle, but she wasn’table to give it to him.“Okay, one more question. Are you a loyal officer?”“I don’t know what you mean by that,” Eltringham said. “I’m loyal to you,and I’m an officer.”Hubbard said, “All right, that’s as far as we’ll go this time.”Eltringham walked up on the deck and tried to take in what Hubbard meant."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Suddenly it came to her. Hubbard wasn’t talking about the present. He wasreferring to the time in her visualization. Some catastrophe must havehappened. Eltringham realized that it must have been her planet that was beingattacked, and she had been trying to save it.A few minutes later, Hubbard came up on deck and stood beside her. Sheturned to him and said, “Yep, you’re right, sir. I was a loyal officer. I am.”Hubbard beamed.THE AVON RIVER WAS traveling down the east side of Corsica when Hubbardgathered his crew and read them a new revelation. Nearby, in the north ofCorsica, there was an underground space station, he said. He even provided thecoordinates. There, a secret doorway would open by a palm print on the lock—but only one person’s hand would do the trick. Hubbard smiled suggestively,without saying whose hand that would be. The rock face would slide open,revealing an immense cavern harboring a mother ship and hundreds of smallercraft, all fueled and ready to go.The space station would remain undiscovered, however. Word arrived thatthe Royal Scotman had run into trouble with the port authorities in Valencia,where Hubbard had hoped to make a permanent base. He furiously abandonedthe expedition and ordered the Avon River to make haste to Valencia before theRoyal Scotman was forcibly expelled from the Spanish harbor. The crew wasbitterly disappointed that they would miss uncovering the space station. “Ifthere’s time, we’ll come back,” Hubbard promised.After making amends with the port captain in Valencia, Hubbard threw aparty to report on the Mission into Time. He was loud and aʃected, in whatEltringham privately called his “full pantomime mode.” Such moments made hercringe. She hid in the back of the crowd. She genuinely revered Hubbard, butwhen he was strutting in front of his acolytes, he could become comically self-important, a parody of himself. His eyes rolled, his body language wasinappropriate and weird, and his hands ɻew around meaninglessly in odddirections. Sometimes he spoke with a British accent or a Scottish brogue. In heropinion, his performance was ridiculous, but also disturbing. If the man sheregarded as a savior was a “nut case,” what did that say about his teachings?What did it say about her, that she idolized him while at the same timeharboring these illicit feelings of shame? No one else seemed to share thesewarring perceptions. She felt very much alone.Hubbard regaled the crowd with the story of his romance with the temple"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"priestess in Sardinia when he was a Carthaginian sailor. “The girl would say,‘Hey, how are YOU?’ and all the other guys didn’t stand a chance for a while. Ifyou’ve got enough war vessels and you’re making enough dough, girls usuallysay this.”He said he had recently remembered a secret passageway into the temple.“Missions were sent ashore to survey and map the area to see if they couldn’tdiscover this old secret entrance to the temple.” If they found it, that wouldprove the truthfulness of his past-life recollections, what he called the “wholetrack memory.”“And now,” he said, “I’m going to call on Hana Eltringham to tell you whetheror not it was a positive result.”Mortiɹed, Eltringham stood in front of her colleagues and ratiɹed Hubbard’sɹndings. “We did ɹnd the tunnel,” she said, mentioning a ditch that themissionaires had found, which had a tile base. “So that was totally proven andaccurate.”THE ANTICIPATION SURROUNDING the release of OT III was intense, so when Hubbardɹnally made it available to a select group of Sea Org members, in March 1968aboard the Royal Scotman in Valencia, a thrill radiated through the entire crew.The saga of Hubbard’s research in Tangier and Las Palmas led them to think thatthis was the breakthrough that would lead to the salvation of the planet. They—the Sea Org—would be the vanguard of this movement, newly empowered bythe revelations that Hubbard promised.In a lecture aboard the ship, Hubbard said that in researching OT III, he haduncovered two “incidents”—which, for him, meant implants—that preventedthetans from being free. Incident One was a kind of Garden of Eden fall fromgrace that occurred four quadrillion years ago, which is when Hubbard dates theorigin of the universe. Before Incident One, thetans were in a pure, godlikestate. Suddenly, there was a loud snap and a ɻood of light. A chariot appeared,trailed by a trumpeting cherub; then darkness. This incident marked the momentwhen thetans became separated from their original static condition and createdthe physical universe of matter, energy, space, and time (MEST). In the process,they lost awareness of their immortality.Incident Two is central to the OT III saga. This one took place seventy-ɹvemillion years ago in the Galactic Confederacy, which was composed of seventy-six planets and twenty-six stars. “The world we live in now replicates thecivilization of that period,” Hubbard said. “People at that particular time and"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"place were walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like theclothes they wear this very minute.... The cars they drove looked exactly thesame, and the trains they ran looked the same, and the boats they had lookedthe same. Circa nineteen-fifty, nineteen-sixty.”A tyrannical overlord named Xenu ruled the Confederacy. “He was aSuppressive to end all Suppressives,” Hubbard told his followers. Xenu had beenchosen by a kind of Praetorian guard called the Loyal Oɽcers, but they realizedthat their leader was wicked and they decided to remove him. Xenu had otherplans, Hubbard said. “He took the last moments he had in oɽce to really goofthe ɻoof.” Xenu and a few evil conspirators—mainly psychiatrists—fed falseinformation to the population to draw them into centers where Xenu’s troopscould destroy them. “One of the mechanisms they used was to tell them to comein for an income-tax investigation,” Hubbard related. “So in they went, and thetroops started slaughtering them.” The preferred method was to shoot a needleinto a lung, paralyzing the thetan with an injection of frozen alcohol and glycol.The frozen bodies were packed into boxes and loaded onto space planes, whichresembled the DC-8 jetliner. “No diʃerence—except the DC-8 had fans—propellers—on it and the space plane didn’t.” In this fashion, billions of thetanswere transported to Teegeeack, the planet now called Earth, where they weredropped into volcanoes and then blown up with hydrogen bombs.Thetans are immortal, however. Freed from their corporeal incarnations, theyɻoated along on the powerful winds created by the explosion. Then they weretrapped in an electronic ribbon and placed in front of a “three-D, super colossalmotion picture” for thirty-six days, during which time they were subjected toimages called R6 implants. “These pictures contain God, the Devil, angels, spaceopera, theaters, helicopters, a constant spinning, a spinning dancer, trains andvarious scenes very like modern England. You name it, it’s in this implant.” Theimplant included all world religions and “a motion picture studio” complete withscreenwriters.Xenu didn’t have much time to gloat over his victory. Some Loyal Oɽcersremained, scattered around the galaxy. There was a civil war, and within a year,the Loyal Oɽcers had captured Xenu and locked him up in an electriɹed wirecage buried in a mountain. “He is not likely ever to get out,” Hubbard said.Because Teegeeack was a dumping ground for thetans, it became known as thePrison Planet, “the planet of ill repute.” The Galactic Confederacy abandonedthe area, although various invaders have appeared throughout the millennia. Butthese free-ɻoating thetans remain behind. They are the souls of people whohave been dead for seventy-ɹve million years. They attach themselves to living"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"people because they no longer have free will. There can be millions of themclustered inside a single person’s body. Auditing for Scientologists at OT III andabove would now focus on eliminating the “body thetans”—or BTs—that standin the way of spiritual progress.More than individual salvation was at stake. Hubbard said that the PrisonPlanet had been civilized many times in the past, but it always arrived at thesame end: utter annihilation. No matter how sophisticated mankind became,there was a trigger implanted in the imprisoned thetans that led them to blowthemselves to pieces before they could escape their fate and go on to higherlevels of existence. The goal of Scientology was to “clear the planet” and savehumanity from its endless cycle of self-destruction.Hubbard never really explained how he came by these revelations. “We won’tgo into that,” he told the crew, saying only that he was fortunate to havesomehow escaped the cataclysm so many eons ago. “You are the chosen,” hetold them. “You are the Loyal Oɽcers. We made the agreement way back whenthat we would all get together again. This time no one is going to stop us.”Eltringham and two dozen Sea Org members had the honor of being the veryɹrst group to view the OT III materials. They went in one by one to read thedocuments. When she came to the part about the Loyal Oɽcers, Eltringhamimmediately understood that this was what Hubbard had been talking about: sheinstinctively felt that she had been among them. At the same time, the accountseemed incredible to her, bizarre and completely unfathomable.Her task now was to take the materials into her cabin, along with an E-Meter,and audit herself to discover and expel body thetans. Once they were exposedand confronted, Hubbard promised, they would take ɻight, “lickety-split.” Shebegan each day with a session, but she couldn’t locate any BTs. At the end of theweek she turned in her folder and asked for help. She went through reviewauditing, but it was no use. She began to worry that she was unauditable, whatHubbard called a Dog Case or a Degraded Being—someone who had committedso many misdeeds as to be beyond help. It was all her fault.Despite the fact that he was only fourteen, Quentin—LRH’s heir apparent—was among the ɹrst to be initiated into the OT III mysteries. Everyone on theship knew what was happening, and people would hover near the cabin wherethe materials were held to see the expression on the faces of those who hadbeen exposed to it. When Quentin emerged, he was pale, and he threw upviolently. After that, he was never as sunny as he used to be."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"TO MAKE SURE his orders were carried out, Hubbard created the Commodore’sMessengers Organization. In the beginning, the Messengers were four youngteenage girls, including Yvonne Gillham’s two daughters, Terri and Janis, whowere thirteen and eleven years old; Annie Tidman, twelve; and, brieɻy,Hubbard’s youngest daughter, Suzette, who was thirteen at the time. Soon,several more teenage girls joined them, and Suzette went to work on the decks.Two of the girls were always posted outside Hubbard’s oɽce, waiting to takehis handwritten directives to the mimeograph machine or deliver his orders inperson. He instructed them to parrot his exact words and tone of voice whenthey were delivering one of his directives—to inform the captain what time toset sail, for instance, or to tell a member of the crew he was “a fucking asshole”if he had displeased him. Hubbard allowed them to create their own uniforms,so in warmer climates they attired themselves in white hot pants, halter tops,and platform shoes. When the Commodore moved around the ship, one or moreMessengers trailed behind him, carrying his hat and an ashtray, lighting hiscigarettes, and quickly moving a chair into place if he started to sit down.People lived in fear of Hubbard’s teenage minions. They had to call theMessenger “sir” even if she was a twelve-year-old girl. (That practice hascontinued in the Sea Org. All senior oɽcials are referred to as “sir,” regardlessof gender.) “They held the power of God in their little hands, their little lips,”Eltringham recalled.The relationship between Hubbard and these girls was intimate but notovertly sexual. They prepared his bath when he retired and would sit outside hisroom until he awakened and called out, “Messenger!” They would help him outof bed, light his cigarette, run his shower, prepare his toiletries, and help himdress. Some of the children had parents on the ship, others were there alone, butin either case Hubbard was their primary caretaker—and vice versa. When thegirls became old enough to start wearing makeup, Hubbard was the one whoshowed them how to apply it. He also helped them do their hair.While he was on the ship, Hubbard was working out a code of Scientologyethics. He began with the idea that man is basically good. Even a criminal leavesclues to his crime, because he wishes for someone to stop his unethical behavior,Hubbard theorized. Similarly, a person who has accidentally hurt himself orgotten ill is “putting ethics in on himself” in order to lessen the damage he doesto others or to his environment. These were testaments to the basic longing ofall people to live decent, worthy lives.Good and evil actions can be judged only by understanding what Hubbardtermed the Eight Dynamics. The First Dynamic is the Self and its urge toward"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"existence. The Second Dynamic is Sex, which includes the sexual act as well asthe family unit. The Third Dynamic is the Group—any school, or class,organization, city, or nation. The Fourth Dynamic is Mankind. The FifthDynamic is the urge toward existence of all living creatures, includingvegetables and grass—“anything directly and intimately motivated by life.” TheSixth Dynamic is the matter, energy, space, and time that compose the realitywe live in. The Seventh Dynamic is the Spiritual, which must be obtained beforeexpanding into the Eighth Dynamic, which is called Inɹnity or God. TheScientology mantra for judging ethical behavior is “the greatest good for thegreatest number of dynamics”—a formula that can excuse quite a number ofcrimes.Every individual or group moves through stages, which Hubbard calls EthicsConditions, that incline toward either survival or collapse. They range from thehighest state, Power, to the lowest, Confusion. The way to determine whatcondition one is in at any given moment is through statistics, compiled eachThursday at two p.m. For a Scientology church, the relevant statistic might behow much money it is bringing in. The “org” that brings in less money weekafter week is in a condition of Non-Existence, which, plotted on a graph, isrepresented as a steeply plummeting line. A level or slightly declining lineindicates a condition of Emergency. Slightly up is Normal; sharply up isAʀuence. Every Scientology organization, and every member of its staʃ,henceforth would be judged by the implacable weekly statistics. Hubbardwarned his charges, “You have to establish an ethics presence hard. Otherwise,you’re just gonna be wrapped around a telegraph pole.”The years at sea were critical ones for the future of Scientology. Even asHubbard was inventing the doctrine, each of his decisions and actions wouldbecome enshrined in Scientology lore as something to be emulated—hiscigarette smoking, for instance, which is still a feature of the church’s culture atthe upper levels, as are his 1950s habits of speech, his casual misogyny, hisaversion to perfume and scented deodorants, and his love of cars andmotorcycles and Rolex watches. More signiɹcant is the legacy of his belittlingbehavior toward subordinates and his paranoia about the government. Suchtraits stamped the religion as an extremely secretive and sometimes hostileorganization that saw enemies on every corner.Because Hubbard viewed the world that way, he awakened suspicion thatthere must be something very dangerous about Scientology. One by one, portsbegan turning away the fleet. It had begun with Gibraltar in 1967, when the shipwas refused assistance during a heavy storm in the strait. England banned"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"foreign Scientologists from entering the country for study in July 1968 anddeclared Hubbard an undesirable alien. Hubbard took out his frustration on hiscrew. He assigned Yvonne Gillham a condition of Non-Existence and reduced herto a “swamper,” which he deɹned as “one who cleans up.” Her hands becameraw and gnarled. “She was like Cinderella,” a friend recalled, “alwaysscrubbing.”While the ships were docked in Valencia, a storm arose. Hubbard happened tobe aboard the Avon River when he noticed that the Royal Scotman had torn freefrom one of its mooring lines. He screamed that someone should hoist theanchor and start the engines, but before the crew reacted, the big ship crashedagainst the dock, damaging its prop. Although the ship was not badly damaged,Hubbard assigned the crew and the Royal Scotman itself to a condition ofLiability, which is below Non-Existence on his ethics scale. Hubbard stayedaboard the Avon River and steamed oʃ to Marseilles until the Royal Scotman wasreturned to favor. Mary Sue was made the captain and ordered to retrain thecrew and spruce up the ship to an acceptable state. No one could bathe orchange clothes for months. The crew wore dirty gray rags on their left arms,which signaled their degraded status. Even Mary Sue’s snappish Corgi, Vixie, hada rag around its collar, and the ship itself wore a bracelet of gray tarpaulinsaround its funnel. An Ethics Officer walked the decks actually swinging a mace.Despite the squalid conditions, Mary Sue ran the ship with a minimum ofhysteria, earning her the respect and loyalty of many aboard. Without Hubbard,the mood lightened. Mary Sue used to have parties in her cabin with CandySwanson, the children’s tutor, and two men they were sweet on. They danced toJimi Hendrix records. But when Hubbard returned, the party was over.A YOUNG MAN with a gift for languages named Belkacem Ferradj joined the SeaOrg when the ship docked brieɻy in Algiers in 1968. Hubbard, surrounded byhis Messengers, had made an immediate impression on Ferradj. He was dressedlike an admiral, and he spoke with a broad American accent. A golden glowseemed to emanate from his large head. Mary Sue struck Ferradj as “gorgeous,”with long, curly hair and piercing eyes, but he thought she was “the mostsecretive person in the world.” When the ship sailed in July, Ferradj wasaboard, having signed his billion-year contract with the Sea Org.Ferradj became close to Hubbard’s sixteen-year-old daughter, Diana. She haddeveloped into a glamorous young woman, with ɻowing red hair and pale skinshowered with freckles. She played the grand piano in the family dining room"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"on the ship. Some saw her as imperious, a princess, but Ferradj, who was fouryears older than Diana, was smitten. When Hubbard found out about therelationship, he summoned Ferradj to the poop deck. Ferradj said Hubbardgreeted him with a blow to the jaw. “I hit the bulkhead of the ship and slumpedto the deck,” he recalled. “I don’t know if it was because I was an Arab or what.I left in disgrace.”When Otto Roos, a Sea Org executive from Holland, failed to lash a steelcable to a bollard on the dock during a terrible storm in Tunisia, Hubbardordered him thrown from the ship’s bridge into the sea, a height of about fourstories. Hana Eltringham wrote a concerned report to Hubbard that night,explaining that the storm had been so furious that Roos simply couldn’t hang onwhen trying to secure the ship. The report was returned to her with thecomment “Never question LRH.”5Roos survived his punishment, only to set a dismal precedent. After that,overboardings became routine, but mostly from the lower poop deck. Nearlyevery morning, when the crew was mustered, there would be a list of thosesentenced to go over the side, even in rough seas. They would be ɹshed out andhauled back onboard through the old cattle doors that led to the hold. Theoverboardings contributed to the decision of the Greek government to expel theScientology crew from Corfu in March 1969. That didn’t stop the practice. Noneexcept Hubbard family members were spared. John McMaster, the second “ɹrstClear,” was tossed over the side six times, breaking his shoulder on the lastoccasion. He left the church not long afterward. Eltringham had to stand withHubbard and his aides on the deck when the punishments were meted out. If thecrewman seemed insuɽciently cowed by the prospect, Hubbard would have hishands and feet bound. Whitɹeld remembered one American woman, Julia LewisSalmen, sixty years old, a longtime Scientology executive, who was bound andblindfolded before being thrown overboard. “She screamed all the way down,”Eltringham said. “When the sound stopped, Hubbard ordered a deck hand tojump in after her. Had he not, I think Julia may have drowned.”Hubbard chose a diʃerent punishment for another of the older members ofthe crew, Charlie Reisdorf. He and two other Sea Org crew were made to raceeach other around the rough, splintery decks while pushing peanuts with theirnoses. “They all had raw, bleeding noses, leaving a trail of blood behind them,”a senior auditor recalled. The entire crew was ordered to watch the spectacle.“Reisdorf was in his late ɹfties, probably. His two daughters were Messengers;they were eleven or twelve at the time, and his wife was there also. It was hardto say which was worse to watch: this old guy with a bleeding nose or his wife"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"and kids sobbing and crying and being forced to watch this. Hubbard wasstanding there, calling the shots, yelling, ‘Faster, faster!’ ”Hubbard increasingly turned his wrath on children, who were becoming anuisance on the ship. He thought that they were best raised away from theirparents, who were “counter-intention” to their children. As a result, he becametheir only—stern as well as neglectful—parent. Children who committed minorinfractions, such as laughing inappropriately or failing to remember aScientology term, would be made to climb to the crow’s nest, at the top of themast, four stories high, and spend the night, or sent to the hold and made tochip rust. A rambunctious four-year-old boy named Derek Greene, an adoptedblack child, had taken a Rolex watch belonging to a wealthy member of the SeaOrg and dropped it overboard. Hubbard ordered him conɹned in the chainlocker, a closed container where the massive anchor chain is stored. It was dark,damp, and cold. There was a danger that the child could be mutilated if theanchor was accidentally lowered or slipped. Although he was fed, he was notgiven blankets or allowed to go to the bathroom. He stayed sitting on the chainfor two days and nights. The crew could hear the boy crying. His motherpleaded with Hubbard to let him out, but Hubbard reminded her of theScientology axiom that children are actually adults in small bodies, and equallyresponsible for their behavior. Other young children were sentenced to thelocker for infractions—such as chewing up a telex—for as long as three weeks.Hubbard ruled that they were Suppressive Persons. One little girl, a deaf mute,was placed in the locker for a week because Hubbard thought it might cure herdeafness.Hubbard explained to Hana Eltringham that the punishments were meant toraise the level of “confront” in order to deal with the evil in the universe. Onemember of Eltringham’s crew on the Avon River, Terry Dickinson, a jocularAustralian electrician, made the mistake of failing to order a part for the ship-to-shore radio. Hubbard sent a handwritten note to Eltringham ordering her tokeep Dickinson awake until the part arrived and the radio was properlyinstalled. If the crewman fell asleep, he would be expelled. Eltringham guiltilycarried out the order, but she knew the hapless Dickinson couldn’t make it onhis own, so she stayed awake with him for ɹve days and nights, pouring coʃeedown his throat, walking him up and down the beach, and consoling him as hewept and said he couldn’t take it anymore. Eltringham believed she was savingDickinson’s soul, as well as her own, but he left shortly after that incident, “abroken man.” Later, Hubbard wrote a note explaining that Dickinson “did nothave the confront to see this through.”"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"“You would say to yourself, ‘Why didn’t you do anything? Why didn’t youspeak out?’ ” Eltringham later remarked. “You see, I was a true believer. Ibelieved that Hubbard knew what he was doing. I, unfortunately, believed thathe knew what it was going to take to help everyone in the world and that, eventhough I didn’t understand, it was my duty to follow and support what he wasdoing. None of us spoke out. None of us did anything.”IN THE SHIP’S LOG of December 8, 1968, Hubbard mentions an organization he callsSMERSH, a name taken from James Bond novels. Hubbard describes it as a“hidden government...that aspired to world domination!” Psychiatry is thedominating force behind this sinister institution. “Recently a check showed thatwe had never seen or heard of an ‘insane’ person who had not been in theirhands,” Hubbard writes. “And the question arises, is there any insanity at all?That is not manufactured by them?” He said that SMERSH had made one bigmistake, however; it attacked Scientology. He vowed revenge.Hubbard had been wooing a young Florida woman, Elizabeth Gablehouse, tojoin the Sea Org. She had come from a prominent family in Tallahassee, Florida,and had studied in Europe. She spoke French, German, and Spanish. She hadadmirable social skills; moreover, she was a redhead, always a stamp of pre-eminence in Hubbard’s book. Finally, Kit agreed to join the Royal Scotman in1969, just as the ship was being expelled from Corfu. She was soon appointed tothe “Missionaires Elite Unit.” Hubbard already had an assignment in mind forher.Hubbard set a course for Cagliari, on the Italian island of Sardinia. On theway, he personally tutored her in his plan to take over the World Federation forMental Health, which was headquartered in Geneva. Hubbard had learned thatthe organization had never bothered to actually incorporate itself inSwitzerland. His grand idea was to set up an office in Bern, the capital, posing asan American delegation of the WFMH bent on reforming the organization fromwithin. The true scheme was to establish a presence in the country long enoughto incorporate as the WFMH; and then, posing as the actual mental healthorganization, go to the United Nations with a plan for enforced euthanization ofthe “useless or unfixable” elements of society. Hubbard predicted that the outcrythat would surely follow would turn the world against the WFMH. It would be apowerful strike against his most formidable enemy, SMERSH.All the way to Sardinia Hubbard drilled Kit in the history of the healthorganization, its former presidents, and the policies it supported, such as"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"electroshock therapy. Kit didn’t need to be persuaded about the dangers of thatpractice; her own mother had been subjected to electroshock in the 1940s,without her consent, as treatment for postpartum depression. After that, hermother suffered from amnesia and a fear of change and losing control.By the time the Royal Scotman docked in Cagliari, Kit was well schooled. Sheand another Sea Org member, Mary Pat Shelley, a trained Shakespearian actressfrom Cincinnati, traveled to Bern. They set up an oɽce, purchased furniture,and covered the walls with phony certiɹcates. They had business cards andstationery printed. Then they ɹled papers for incorporation as the WorldFederation for Mental Health.Soon after that, they received a call from the Federal Oɽce of Public Healthin Switzerland demanding to know what they were up to. The two women wereinvited to explain themselves to the director himself.Kit and Marjorie were both in their early twenties. They dressed in dowdyclothes and put powder in their hair to make themselves appear older. Whenthey arrived at the oɽce, they were shown to a conference room with about tenother people, including the director, a stenographer, and several lawyers. MaryPat’s hands were trembling as Kit brazenly presented their case for taking overthe WFMH. She claimed that the organization had long been misrepresentingitself; for instance, was the director aware that the WFMH never even botheredto incorporate in Switzerland? He was not. Nor was he a fan of some of thepolicies that the women said that WFMH championed, such as euthanasia. Bythe end of the meeting, the director seemed persuaded. “I like how youAmericans work!” he said enthusiastically.The women emerged from the meeting elated, but the response to their telexto Hubbard surprised them. He ordered them back to the ship, “for yourprotection.” As soon as they returned to Cagliari, Hubbard cast oʃ lines and seta course through the Strait of Gibraltar for open water. He even changed thenames of his ships, in order to erase the connections with Scientology. TheEnchanter became the Diana, the Avon River became the Athena, and the ɻagshipRoyal Scotman turned into the Apollo. All were registered with Panamaniancredentials as belonging to the Operation and Transport Corporation. The Apollowas now billed as “the pride of the Panamanian fleet,” “a ɻoating school ofphilosophy,” and “the sanest space on the planet.”Hubbard was convinced that the Swiss authorities had laid a trap: they wouldarrest Kit and Mary Pat and force them to testify and expose his whole scheme.For months, he was afraid to touch land. The ship drifted aimlessly in theAtlantic; the crew was forced to live on its stores, and soon they were down to"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"half-rations. Near Madeira, they were caught up in a ɹerce tropical storm, whichthreatened to swamp the Apollo. Immense waves swept over the funnel andshattered the two-inch-thick windows of the dining room. Water gushed into theengine room, where the seasick oɽcer on watch tied a bucket around his neck.Terriɹed Messengers hauled themselves along the rails of the wildly pitchingdeck trying to deliver communications to the bridge; at times the nose of theship was pointed directly down into the sea. The storm lasted ten days,propelling the ship eight hundred miles north, all the way to the Azores.Portuguese postcard of the ApolloLooking for a safe port, Hubbard turned toward Morocco. He thought that anArab country might be safer and less conspicuous for the Scientology ɻeet,which had gained too much unfavorable attention in European ports. In October1969, he dropped anchor in Saɹ, near Marrakesh. At last the crew, shaken andhungry, could take on stores. Hubbard began sizing up the country as a possibleScientology homeland. He picked Kit Gablehouse and Richard Wrigley, anotherredhead, to lead an exploratory mission to the capital, Rabat. The only orderthey got from Hubbard was to “secure Morocco.”Wrigley and Gablehouse set up in the Hôtel La Tour Hassan, where diplomatstypically stayed. Wrigley became friendly with an African envoy and drifted oʃto the Ivory Coast, leaving Kit to secure Morocco by herself. She established anoffice titled the American Institute of Human Engineering and Development, andsold a project to develop hydroponic farming to the Moroccan government. That"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"project went nowhere, but it gave her legitimate cover. With her social skills,she soon found herself hobnobbing with the royal palace’s inner circles—inparticular, she made friends among some high-ranking military oɽcers,including a tall, handsome intelligence officer named Colonel Allam.As it happened, Colonel Allam and Kit shared a birthday, May 17, so shefound herself invited to a soiree at the governor’s palace in Marrakesh. In themiddle of the party, there was a great stir caused by the arrival of GeneralMohammed Oufkir, the truculent minister of the interior. General Oufkir cast along shadow over the nation, which had long been terrorized by the tyrannicalrule of King Hassan II. Kit immediately sized him up as a shady ɹgure—tall,hollow-cheeked, his eyes hidden by dark glasses, the blood of so many of hiscountrymen on his hands.Her Moroccan friends bluntly warned Kit to keep her distance from themilitary, but Hubbard was pressing her to do the very opposite. He and MarySue rented a villa in Tangier. Mary Sue was thrilled; she hated being cooped upaboard ship. The prospect of taking over Morocco began to seem not so far-fetched.For most of the next year, Kit lived in Rabat, reporting to the Apollo everycouple of months. In July 1971, Colonel Allam invited her and two otherScientologists to watch a war-games exercise on the occasion of the king’s forty-second birthday. The games, which were held at the king’s summer palace inSkhirat, were a panoramic fantasia of Berber tribesmen on camels, followed byinfantry formations and tank manuevers. The audience sat in tents and nibbledon endless hors d’oeuvres, and the pretty Scientology girls fended oʃ advancesfrom the Moroccan brass. They played poker with the generals to pass the time.Everything went smoothly, but suddenly, in the middle of the airshow portionof the exercise, two ɹghter aircraft emerged from a cloud and dropped out offormation, ɻying low over the panicked crowd. They trained their guns on theking’s tent, which was next to where Kit and the other Scientologists weresitting. Simultaneously, a thousand military cadets stormed the palace. Ahundred people were killed in the coup attempt. The king escaped by hiding inthe toilet. Kit and her companions were quickly shuttled back to their hotel.Unnerved, they turned on the television to see what had happened, only towatch the generals they had been sitting with lined up against a wall and shot.The coup attempt quickly fell apart. King Hassan ɻed to France and left thecountry in charge of General Oufkir, who was also given the post of minister ofdefense. There was no one else the king trusted. He was convinced that the CIAwas determined to oust him."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Even in this chaotic and dangerous situation, Hubbard saw an opportunity. Heproposed the creation of an elite guard to protect the king. He ordered Kit toinstruct General Oufkir in the use of E-Meters as lie detectors in order todetermine which members of the government had been a part of the rebel forcesand root out subversion. She refused; her own sources told her it was far toodangerous, not only for her, but for everyone involved. Hubbard ordered herback to the ship and put her in charge of the snack bar. He sent another team,and they quickly began to uncover the plotters. Colonel Allam was marched outto the desert and shot, along with dozens of others.When King Hassan II returned from France, in 1972, a squadron of Moroccanɹghter jets accompanied his passenger jet. As soon as they left French airspace,however, one of the escort jets began ɹring on the king’s aircraft. The king, whowas also a pilot, immediately grasped what was happening. He raced into thecockpit and seized control. “Stop ɹring! The tyrant is dead!” he shouted into theradio. Then he flew the jet on to Morocco.That night, the architect of the coup was revealed: General Oufkir. It wasannounced that he had committed “suicide,” although his body was riddled withbullets.The shaken king turned his attention to the Scientologists. He had longsuspected that Scientology was a CIA front—a rumor that was spreading all overthe Mediterranean. There was also gossip that the Apollo was involved in drugtraɽcking and prostitution, or that it was part of a pornography ring. InDecember 1972, the Scientologists were expelled from the country, leaving atrail of confusion and recrimination behind them.6PAULETTE COOPER WAS studying comparative religion for a summer at Harvard inthe late 1960s when she became interested in Scientology, which was gainingattention. “A friend came to me and said he had joined Scientology anddiscovered he was Jesus Christ,” she recalled. She decided to go undercover tosee what the church was about. “I didn’t like what I saw,” she said. TheScientologists she encountered seemed to be in a kind of trance. When shelooked into the claims that the church was making, she found many of themfalse or impossible to substantiate. “I lost my parents in Auschwitz,” Coopersaid, explaining her motivation in deciding to write about Scientology at a timewhen there had been very little published and those who criticized the churchcame under concentrated legal and personal attacks. A slender, soft-spokenwoman, Cooper published her ɹrst article in Queen, a British magazine, in 1970."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"“I got death threats,” she said. The church ɹled suit against her. She refused tobe silent. “I thought if, in the nineteen-thirties people had been more outspoken,maybe my parents would have lived.” The following year, Cooper published abook, The Scandal of Scientology, that broadly attacked the teachings of Hubbard,revealing among other things that Hubbard had misrepresented his credentialsand that defectors claimed to have been ɹnancially ripped oʃ and harassed ifthey tried to speak out.Soon after her book came out, Cooper received a visit from Ron and SaraHubbard’s daughter, Alexis, who was then studying at Smith College. Cooperhad demanded that Alexis bring substantial identiɹcation to prove who she was,but when she opened the door, she drew a breath. It was as if Hubbard had beenreincarnated as a freckled, twenty-two-year-old woman. Alexis asked Cooperwhether or not she was legitimate. In her social circle, illegitimacy was aterrible stigma. Cooper was able to show her Ron and Sara’s marriagecertificate.Alexis had been to Hawaii over the Christmas holidays to visit her mother.When she returned to college, she learned that there was a man who had beenwaiting to see her for four days. He identiɹed himself as an FBI agent and saidhe had several pages of a letter he was required to read aloud to her. The lettersaid that Alexis was illegitimate. It was clearly written by Hubbard. “Yourmother was with me as a secretary in Savannah in late 1948,” the letter stated.He said he had to ɹre Sara because she was a “street-walker” and a Nazi spy. “InJuly 1949 I was in Elizabeth, New Jersey, writing a movie,” the letter continues.“She turned up destitute and pregnant.” Out of the goodness of his heart,Hubbard said, he had taken Sara in, to see her “through her trouble.” Weirdly,the letter was signed, “Your good friend, J. Edgar Hoover.”After The Scandal of Scientology, Cooper’s life turned into a nightmare. Shewas followed; her phone was tapped; she was sued nineteen times. Her nameand telephone number were written on the stalls in public men’s rooms. Oneday, when Cooper was out of town, her cousin, who was staying in her NewYork apartment, opened the door for a delivery from a ɻorist. The deliverymantook a gun from the bouquet, put it to her temple, and pulled the trigger. Whenthe gun didn’t ɹre, he attempted to strangle her. Cooper’s cousin screamed andthe assailant ɻed. Cooper then moved to an apartment building with a doorman,but soon after that her three hundred neighbors received letters saying that shewas a prostitute with venereal disease who molested children. A womanimpersonating Cooper voiced threats against Secretary of State Henry Kissingerand President Gerald Ford at a Laundromat, while a Scientologist who happened"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"to be present notiɹed the FBI. Two members from the Guardian’s oɽce brokeinto Cooper’s psychiatrist’s oɽce and stole her ɹles, then sent copies to heradoptive parents. Cooper was charged with mailing bomb threats to the Churchof Scientology. In the courtroom, the prosecutor produced a threatening letterwith her ɹngerprint on it, and Cooper fainted. (Later, she remembered signing apetition, which may have had a blank page underneath it.) In May 1973, Cooperwas indicted by the US Attorney’s oɽce for mailing the threats and then lyingabout it before the grand jury.IF THE RUMORS about Hubbard were true—that he had created a religion only inorder to get rich—he had long since accomplished that goal. One of hisdisaffected lieutenants later claimed that Hubbard had admitted to “an insatiablelust for power and money.” He hectored his adherents on this subject. “MAKEMONEY,” he demanded in a 1972 policy letter. “MAKE MORE MONEY. MAKEOTHERS PRODUCE SO AS TO MAKE MONEY.” In order to siphon money intoHubbard’s personal accounts, a number of front organizations were established,including the Religious Research Foundation, which was incorporated in Liberia.In the mid-seventies that single foundation had an account in Switzerlandcontaining more than $300 million. At one point, panicked that Switzerland wasgoing to make a change in its tax laws, Hubbard ordered his medical oɽcer,Kima Douglas, to move those funds from Switzerland to Lichtenstein. Shedescribed stacks of cash sitting in the bank vault, mostly hundred-dollar bills,four feet high and three to four feet wide, one pile in Hubbard’s name, the otherin the church’s. “Church’s was bigger but his was big too,” she told Hubbard’sbiographer Russell Miller. L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., remembered shoeboxes full ofmoney in his father’s closet. He later testiɹed that Hubbard habitually kept“great chunks of cash” within easy reach, “so that if there was any problem hecould just take off right out the window.”“Making money, I think, to Hubbard was paramount,” Hana Eltringham laterspeculated. “He wasn’t that interested in it for himself. He did have perks, hedid have his cars, his motorbikes, his books, his good food, and things like that,and eventually he had his villas and he had his estates and so on, but the moneythat he wanted predominantly was for power.”For all his wealth, Hubbard spent much of his time in his cabin alone, auditinghimself on the E-Meter and developing his spiritual technology. He may havebeen grandiose and delusional, but the endless stream of policy letters andtraining routines that poured from his typewriter hour after hour, day after day,"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"attests to his obsession with the notion of creating a step-by-step pathway touniversal salvation. If it was all a con, why would he bother?Hubbard and Mary Sue slept in separate staterooms. In the opinion ofmembers of their household staʃ and others, by the time they boarded ship,Hubbard had lost interest in Mary Sue sexually. Yvonne Gillham had managed toget herself posted on another ship, out of range of Hubbard’s longing and MarySue’s wrath. For the most part, the Commodore left his female crew membersalone. One exception was a tall, slender woman from Oregon. She approachedHana Eltringham with a big smile on her face and confessed that she was havingan aʃair with Hubbard. Soon after that, Hubbard busted the woman down todeckhand and assigned Eltringham to audit her. The woman would weepthrough the session. Eltringham would dutifully pass along the auditing ɹles toHubbard for review. “I could hear him chortling,” she recalled.The situation was much less restrained belowdecks. The Sea Org memberswere young and vigorous; sexual escapades were routine, and marriages quiteɻuid. Hubbard seemed to be oblivious, but Mary Sue was increasinglyscandalized. When she learned that a crew member, who was nineteen ortwenty, had slept with a ɹfteen-year-old girl on the ship, she got a dagger out ofher cabin and held it against his throat and told him he had to be oʃ the ship intwo hours or else. In 1971, on New Year’s Eve, there was a drunken orgy ofhistoric proportions. “Maybe a hundred Sea Org members were having sexeverywhere from the topside boatdecks to the lowest holds of the ship,” one ofthe participants recalled. Mary Sue had had enough. With two attractive teenagedaughters of her own on the ship, she started cracking down on premarital sex.Hubbard observed that 1972 was a leap year, and said that any woman on theship could propose to any man, leading to a sudden rash of weddings. Hubbardhad forbidden babies on board, but so many women were getting pregnant thathe began permitting the children to stay, rather than sending their parents toanother post. The baby boom eventually prompted Hubbard to order that noone could get pregnant without his permission; according to several Sea Orgmembers, any woman disobeying his command would be “oʃ-loaded” toanother Scientology organization or flown to New York for an abortion.7WORD ARRIVED while the Apollo was in dry dock in Portugal that the Frenchgovernment was going to indict the Church of Scientology for fraud, withHubbard named as a conspirator (he would eventually be convicted in absentiaand sentenced to four years in prison). Hubbard ɻew to New York the very next"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"day. Few crew members knew where he was. Jim Dincalci, his medical oɽcer,and Paul Preston, a former Green Beret who acted as Hubbard’s bodyguard,joined him and set up housekeeping in Queens.It was an odd interlude. Abruptly freed from the daily responsibility ofrunning the ship, training executives, and overseeing the entire Scientologyenterprise, Hubbard suddenly had time on his hands. He spent it watchingtelevision and reading novels. Dincalci was designated to be the chef, whichmeant that ɹsh sticks and pasta were on the menu until Dincalci learned how toexpand his repertoire. He studied Adelle Davis’s popular health food book Let’sGet Well. Hubbard began to gain energy and lose weight. He would go for walksaround the neighborhood, but always in a clownish disguise—a wig, a hat, andglasses with no prescription. Hubbard thought he was being nondescript, butDincalci heard the comments the kids were making about how goofy he looked.Dincalci had long since come to the conclusion that Hubbard was not anOperating Thetan. He was obese and weird and he failed to exhibit any of theextraordinary powers that are supposed to be a part of the OT arsenal.Moreover, he was under siege by various countries. Why couldn’t he simply setthings straight? Wasn’t he supposed to be in control of his environment? Howcould he be so persecuted and powerless? What was he doing hiding out inQueens, wearing a wig and watching television when the planet neededsalvation? At one point, Hubbard was talking about how pleasant it used to beto sit on a cloud, but now he complained to Dincalci, “I’m PTS to nations.” Hemeant that he was a Potential Trouble Source because entire countries weredysfunctional and suppressive. Dincalci thought, “Oh, that explains it,” but thenit didn’t, really.During the ten months Hubbard was in hiding in Queens, he began plottinganother way to destroy SMERSH. His escapade to take over the WorldFederation for Mental Health had been foiled, he believed, by those sinisterforces. One day, Hubbard surprised Dincalci by asking him for the names ofSnow White’s Seven Dwarfs. Dincalci dutifully trotted to the library to lookthem up. He wouldn’t learn the real signiɹcance of Snow White for some time.Hubbard had set in motion an operation so daring and dangerous that itthreatened to destroy Scientology forever.On April 20, 1973, Hubbard wrote a secret order, “Snow White Program,” inwhich he noted a dangerous trend in the gradual reduction since 1967 ofcountries available to Scientology. He put the blame on the American and Britishgovernments, which he said were spreading false allegations against the church.He proposed to swamp the countries that had turned against the church in a vast"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"campaign of litigation with the aim of expunging defamatory ɹles and leavingHubbard and the Apollo “free to frequent all western ports and nations withoutthreat.”In Hubbard’s absence, Mary Sue exerted increased control over the church’soperations. Hubbard had already appointed her the head of the Guardian’sOɽce, a special unit with a broad mandate to protect the religion. Among itsother duties, the GO functioned as an intelligence agency, gathering informationon critics and government agencies around the world, generating lawsuits tointimidate opponents, and waging an unremitting campaign against mentalhealth professionals. It was the GO that Hubbard tasked with Snow White.Under Mary Sue’s direction, the GO inɹltrated government oɽces around theworld, looking for damning ɹles on the church. Within the next few years, asmany as ɹve thousand Scientologists were covertly placed in 136 governmentagencies worldwide. Project Grumpy, for instance, covered Germany, where theGuardian’s Oɽce was set up to inɹltrate Interpol as well as German police andimmigration authorities. In addition, there was a scheme to accuse Germancritics of the church of committing genocide. Project Sleepy was to clear ɹles inAustria; Happy was for Denmark, Bashful for Belgium, and Dopey for Italy.There were also Projects Mirror, Apple, Reɻection, and so on, all drawn fromelements of the fairy tale. Projects Witch and Stepmother both targeted the UK,the source of Scientology’s immigration problems.Project Hunter was the United States, where Scientologists penetrated the IRS,the Justice, Treasury, and Labor Departments, the Federal Trade Commission,and the Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as foreign embassies andconsulates; private companies and organizations, such as the American MedicalAssociation, the American Psychiatric Association, and the Better BusinessBureau; and newspapers—including the St. Petersburg Times, the Clearwater Sun,and the Washington Post—that were critical of the religion. In an evident attemptat blackmail, they stole the Los Angeles IRS intelligence ɹles of celebrities andpolitical ɹgures, including California governor Jerry Brown, Los Angeles mayorTom Bradley, and Frank Sinatra. Nothing in American history can compare withthe scale of the domestic espionage of Operation Snow White.IN SEPTEMBER 1973, learning that he was not going to be extradited to Franceafter all, Hubbard returned to Lisbon, where the Apollo was in dry dock. Heamused himself by going oʃ on photo expeditions in Portugal, with hisMessengers acting as porters. Then, in December, the Apollo lifted anchor and"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"headed to the warmer climate of the Canary Islands. One day in Tenerife,Hubbard decided to take his Harley-Davidson motorcycle out for a spin on thetwisty mountain roads. Miles away, in the lush volcanic landscape, the Harleyhit a patch of oil or mud and crashed. Hubbard broke his arm and several ribs.Somehow he managed to right his bike and make his way back to the ship.Some members of the Sea Org cite the motorcycle accident as the momentwhen Scientology changed course and sailed toward a darker horizon. Hubbardwas in terrible pain, but he was fearful of doctors and refused to go to thehospital. Dincalci and the ship’s other medical oɽcer, Kima Douglas, neither ofwhom had a medical degree, attempted to treat him. They strapped Hubbard’sinjured arm to his side and wrapped his broken ribs, then sat him in a velvetreading chair, which he rarely left for the next six weeks, day or night.The whole ship could hear him cursing and screaming and throwing plates andthings against the wall with his one good arm. He was in too much discomfort tosleep for more than a couple of hours at a time, so the ranting and moaningwent on almost nonstop. The medical oɽcers had persuaded him to let a localdoctor come aboard with a kind of primitive X-ray machine, which conɹrmedthe broken bones. The doctor left Dincalci a prescription for pain pills. The ɹrsttime Dincalci gave Hubbard the pain pills, however, Hubbard panicked and saidthat they had slowed down his heart. “You’re trying to kill me!” he shouted.Dincalci, who looked upon Hubbard as a father, both spiritually andemotionally, was devastated. Hubbard ordered him “beached”—dropped oʃ inMadeira, the distant Portuguese atoll, where he remained for a year.Other members of the Sea Org were having a hard time coping with theblatant contradiction between Hubbard’s legend and the crabby, disconsolatefigure howling in his stateroom. “If he is who he says he is, why does he have solittle staying power?” Hana Eltringham wondered. “He has a motorcycleaccident, he doesn’t recover quickly, and he doesn’t use Scientology techniqueson himself.”By now, Eltringham had been promoted to Deputy Commodore, the highestpost in the Sea Org after Hubbard himself. She had been off the ship for a coupleof years, in Los Angeles, running the Advanced Orgs—the divisions responsiblefor producing Operating Thetans—and setting up a liaison oɽce to supply theScientology ɻeet. During that period, she began experiencing cripplingheadaches. Some days she was unable to work at all. She couldn’t even lie downbecause the pressure from the pillow was unbearable. The vibration of footstepsin the hall outside her room made the pain excruciating. She thought if she couldonly discover the body thetans that she must be harboring she could ease her"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"misery. Every day, hour after hour, she audited herself on the E-Meter, probingfor some stirring or a sign of recognition. Hubbard himself was her casesupervisor, which made her anxiety all the greater. Despite her rank, she, too,worried about being beached or punished. Even worse, according to Hubbard’sdictates, she alone was responsible for her pain. So why was she doing this toherself?Then, one day in her auditing, she felt something. A kind of “ɻicker.” Was it aBT? She decided that it must be. An immense feeling of relief washed over her.Soon after that, she discovered more BTs—eventually, hundreds, thousands.Sometimes there was a feeling of lightness or of ɻoating when the BT wasexpelled. Other times, Eltringham exteriorized from her body. But the headachesremained. Then something new arrived: quarrelsome voices inside her head. Atɹrst the voices were faint, but they grew louder and more insistent. Eltringhamworried that she was going insane.When she returned to the Apollo, she was shocked by the hellish changes thathad taken place. In January 1974, Hubbard issued Flag Order 3434RB, creatingthe Rehabilitation Project Force. The stated goal was to rehabilitate Sea Orgmembers whose statistics were down or who might be harboring subversivethoughts against Hubbard or his technology. Because the RPF provided a secondchance for those who might otherwise be ɹred, Hubbard saw it as anenlightened management technique, the sole purpose of which was“redemption.” When Eltringham came aboard, she found dozens of crewmembers housed in the old cattle hold belowdecks, illuminated by a singlelightbulb, sleeping on stained mattresses on the ɻoor. They were dressed inblack overalls, called boiler suits, and forbidden to speak to anyone outside theirgroup. They ate using their hands from a bucket of table scraps, shoveling thefood into their mouths as if they were starving.Despite the confusion and the harsh punishment, there were many Sea Orgmembers who experienced their days on the Apollo as a time of incomparableadventure, ɹlled with a sense of mission and an esprit de corps they wouldnever again recapture. Although Hubbard could be terrifying and irrational, andcomically pompous, he still held his followers in thrall. Those who were close tohim saw a generous and caring leader who used his gigantic personality to keephis ship, his ɻeet, his organization, and his religion on track. Karen de laCarriere, a young British auditor, remembers watching Hubbard in his oɽcescreaming at one of the crew; when that person left, cowering, Hubbardswiveled in his chair and gave Karen a big wink. “He was in total control,” sherealized. “It was all theatrical to create a desired effect.”"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Hubbard developed many of the basic Scientology techniques aboard theApollo. In one instance, de la Carriere was having no luck auditing a wealthyScientologist with a long drug history, who kept falling asleep during theirsessions. Hubbard theorized that the LSD he had taken must still be in hissystem; perhaps the drugs could be sweated out by putting him to workswabbing the decks. After six weeks, he was a changed man. De la Carriere saysthat was the beginning of the Scientology drug-treatment program, called thePurification Rundown.A strapping crewman named Bruce Welch had what other crew membersdiagnosed as a nervous breakdown or a psychotic episode. In Scientology terms,he had gone “Type III.” He had a crush on one of the ship’s young women, andwhen he learned she was engaged, he went berserk. According to de la Carriere,Welch got a butcher knife from the pantry and threatened to kill Hubbard andother members of the crew. There were no designated security procedures orpersonnel trained to handle such a case. It took four crewmen to eventuallysubdue Welch and wrestle him into a cabin in the forecastle, the storage areaabove the bow, away from most of the crew, where he screamed continuously.There was a metal bed with a mattress, and a metal cabinet, but Welch managedto tear them apart with his bare hands and shove the pieces through theporthole.A young Australian named Mike Rinder (who would eventually become thechurch’s chief spokesperson) had just arrived aboard the Apollo and was giventhe assignment of guarding Welch’s cabin. He sat on a trunk in the hallway,listening to Welch shouting, “Bring the Commodore here! I want theCommodore right now!” Then Welch would yank on the door, which was lockedand lashed to the bulkhead with sturdy ropes. Several times, Rinder recalled,Welch beat up other members of the crew when he was escorted to thebathroom or given his meals.Hubbard saw Welch’s rampage as an opportunity to experiment with theproblem of acute mental breakdown. Total silence was enforced on theforecastle deck so that Welch would have nothing to stimulate him. Three timesa day, Hubbard would write Welch a note, asking about his well-being.According to de la Carriere, Welch’s response might be, “You’re the devilincarnate. I’m going to enjoy plunging the knife in you.” Hubbard wouldrespond that he understood, and by the way was there any special food that thechef could prepare for him? In this way, Welch’s rage began to subside. Heallowed an auditor to visit him each day. After two weeks, the door to Welch’scabin was unlocked and he emerged, serene and apparently cured."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"“I have made a technical discovery which possibly ranks with the majordiscoveries of the twentieth century,” Hubbard boasted in one of his bulletins.“It is called the Introspection Rundown.” He explained that the psychotic breakhad long bedeviled psychiatry, which had attempted to treat it with drugs,lobotomies, and shock treatments. The key, Hubbard had discovered in histreatment of Welch, was to learn what had caused the person to “introspect”before his breakdown. “THIS MEANS THE LAST REASON TO HAVEPSYCHIATRY AROUND IS GONE,” Hubbard declared. “The psychotic break, thelast of the ‘unsolvable’ conditions that can trap a person, has been solved.... Youhave in your hands the tool to take over mental therapy in full.”Hubbard’s recipe for curing psychosis was to isolate the subject, with theattendants “completely muzzled (no speech).” By discovering the last severeconɻict that triggered the episode, and then helping the subject discharge theemotions surrounding it, the auditor can begin to untangle the mental knots thathave thrown the subject into his present state of wrestling with “the mystery ofsome incorrectly designated error.” The subject should be given vitamins,especially Vitamin B, along with calcium and magnesium, in order to restore hisphysical well-being. He should be examined on the E-Meter for discordantmoments in his life, such as someone accusing him of something he hadn’t done,or being told he was a Potential Trouble Source when he wasn’t, or having hisidentity questioned. These steps are simple, Hubbard said, but “its results aremagical in eʃectiveness.” The goal is to take the highly introverted personality,who is trapped in an endless loop of self-criticism, and bring him out of himself.The subject should be able to look at the world once again and see it as “quitereal and quite bright.”“Do it flawlessly and we will all win,” Hubbard promised.“THIS PLANET IS OURS.”The Apollo crew were in awe of their leader. They had seen thetransformation with their own eyes. “A madman was made sane on the highseas,” de la Carriere said. “To do that, you have got to have a certain amount ofgreatness.”ONCE A WEEK, there was a movie night on the aft deck, with a recently releasedɹlm ɻown in. Popcorn was made, a screen erected, and when everyone wassettled Hubbard would descend from the prom deck, resplendent in hisCommodore’s uniform, with Mary Sue and the children in tow.In the interest of public relations, Hubbard staged free concerts at various"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"ports of call, using the ship’s ragtag band, the Apollo Stars. He wanted to“revolutionize music,” and composed original songs for the band to play. Hestarted a modern dance troupe as well. Quentin wanted to join the dancers, buthis father sternly told him that he had other plans for him. By 1974, Hubbardhad decided that his two oldest children by Mary Sue—Diana, twenty-two, andQuentin, twenty—were to take over the major management and technologyfunctions of Scientology. Diana was enthusiastic—she had been the LieutenantCommander since the age of sixteen and was often at her father’s side—buteveryone knew that Quentin’s great ambition was to ɻy. His cabin was full ofmodel airplanes, suspended from the ceiling with dental ɻoss, and books aboutɻying. He was often seen weaving along the deck with his arms outstretched,making engine noises, completely absorbed in being a plane.Jim Dincalci, the medical oɽcer who was still beached in Madeira, learnedthat the Apollo was headed in his direction. By now, he had made friends withmany of the local people, and he was surprised to learn from them that theApollo was widely suspected of being a spy ship for the CIA.8 He sent telexeswarning the ship that it would be better to avoid Madeira, but Hubbard cameanyway. Soon after the Apollo docked, a mob arrived and began stoning the ship.Hubbard ordered ɹre hoses turned on the crowd, which further infuriated them.There were motorcycles belonging to crew members and two of Hubbard’s carswhich had been oʀoaded onto the pier; the mob shoved them all into theharbor, then loosened the moorings so that the ship drifted oʃshore. Mary Sueand some other members of the ship’s company were stranded in town and hadto be rescued by the local authorities.Quentin returned to the ship in bad shape. He had taken an overdose of pillsin a failed suicide attempt. After his stomach was pumped at a local hospital, hewas brought back to the ship, pale and weak, and put in isolation in his cabin,guarded night and day, becoming the second person to undergo the IntrospectionRundown. Suzette was the only one to visit him. He looked like a broken doll.Quentin was now twenty years old, popular and free-spirited, but in manyways still a soft-spoken, dreamy boy. Although he was small like his mother,and had her coloring, in other respects he bore a strong resemblance to hisfather. His facial features were almost an exact match: almond-shaped eyesunder low, reddish brows; protuberant lips; and a deep cleft in the chin. Eventhough Quentin became one of the highest-rated auditors in the Sea Org, hisfather was constantly disappointed in his performance. “You have to improve,”he barked at Quentin in front of the other auditors. “It doesn’t matter thatyou’re a Hubbard.” Quentin would sit there and smile, seemingly unfazed, as the"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"others cringed for him. Privately, he conɹded, “Daddy doesn’t love meanymore.”Eventually, Hubbard sentenced Quentin to the Rehabilitation Project Force.His “twin” on the RPF was Monica Pignotti, an auditor in training at age twenty-one. As they practiced auditing each other, they became close. Quentin sneakedsome peanut butter from the family pantry and shared it with Monica. Theymade up skits and played with his tape recorder. They never became intimate.Quentin told her that he had once become sexually involved with a woman, butwhen his father found out, she was sent oʃ the ship. He knew that peopleregarded him as a homosexual, he said, but that was only something he toldother women on the ship who were after him because he was Hubbard’s son.Quentin Hubbard, circa 1973HUBBARD SET a new course: due west, toward America. The destination wasCharleston, South Carolina. The crew were thrilled that they would be returningto the States, only to be crestfallen when a message arrived from the Guardian’sOɽce, just as the ship was approaching port, alerting Mary Sue that agents fromUS Customs, Immigration, Coast Guard, DEA, and US Marshals were waiting forthem to dock, plus 180 IRS agents waiting to impound the ship. The federal"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"agents had a subpoena to depose Hubbard in a civil tax case in Hawaii. AScientologist on shore realized what was happening when he was blocked fromentering the dock area. He sent a pizza to a radio operator with a message insideto send to the ship. Hubbard was just ɹve miles oʃshore, but he suddenlybroadcasted a new course over the radio—due north for Halifax, Nova Scotia—then turned sharply south and headed to the Bahamas.Hubbard was sixty-four years old in 1975, as the Apollo began itscircumnavigation of the Caribbean. He weighed 260 pounds. He was stillmeticulously groomed, but his teeth and ɹngers were darkly stained fromconstant smoking. He was on the run from the courts, fearful of beingdiscovered, marked by age, and visibly in decline. In Curaçao, he suʃered asmall stroke and spent several weeks in a local hospital. It was becoming clearthat life at sea posed a real danger for a man in such frail health. His crewrationalized his obvious decline by saying that his body was battered by theresearch he was undertaking and the volumes of suppression aimed at him.“He’s risking his life for us,” they told each other.By now the rumor about the CIA spy ship had spread all over the Caribbean,making the Scientologists unwelcome or at least under suspicion everywherethey went. They were kicked out of Barbados, Curaçao, and Jamaica. Moreover,the Arab oil embargo had sent the price of fuel skyrocketing, so the roving lifewas getting too expensive to support. It was time to come ashore.FROM THE APOLLO, Hubbard sent a couple of delegations to locate a land base forScientology—speciɹcally, a town that the church could take over. One teamarrived in the Florida retirement community of Clearwater—a resonant namefor Scientologists—to look over a dowdy downtown hotel called the FortHarrison, which had earned a place in popular history when Mick Jagger wrotethe lyrics for “Satisfaction” beside the swimming pool in 1965. Hubbardpurchased the Fort Harrison and a bank building across the street using a falsefront called the United Churches of Florida, which he calculated would notdisturb the staid moral climate of the conservative community. When the mayorof Clearwater, Gabriel Cazares, raised questions about the extraordinarysecurity that suddenly appeared around the church buildings, Guardian’s Oɽceoperatives tried to frame him in a staged hit-and-run accident and planted falsemarriage documents in Tijuana, Mexico, to make it appear that Cazares was abigamist. Several months passed before the ɻabbergasted citizens discoveredthat Clearwater had become the Flag Land Base for the Church of Scientology."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"(Scientologists would simply call it Flag.)Hubbard had been keeping a low proɹle in a condominium nearby, but inJanuary 1976 his tailor leaked the news to a St. Petersburg Times reporter thatthe leader of Scientology was in town. As soon as Hubbard heard this, hegrabbed twenty-ɹve thousand dollars in cash, collected Kima Douglas, hismedical oɽcer, and her husband, Michael, and lit out in his Cadillac forOrlando. The next day, he announced that they were going to his old hideout inQueens. The Cadillac was too conspicuous, so he sent Michael out to buy anondescript Chevy hatchback. The trip to New York took three days, withHubbard smoking continuously in the backseat and crying, “There they are!They’re after us!” every time he saw a police car. When they ɹnally arrived,Kima judged Queens too depressing, so they turned around and went toWashington, DC.Meanwhile, agents from the Guardian’s Oɽce raced to Southern California tolook for remote properties where Hubbard could operate more discreetly. Soon,Hubbard and Mary Sue, along with her Tibetan terriers, Yama and Tashi, set upin their new quarters on three large properties in La Quinta, California, a deserttown south of Palm Springs. Hubbard grew a goatee and let his hair hang downto his shoulders. “He looked like Wild Bill Hickok,” one Sea Org memberrecalled. He kept a hopped-up Plymouth and half a million dollars in cash readyfor a quick getaway.Left behind in Clearwater, and without his father hovering over him, Quentinbecame freer and more assertive. He befriended an older Scientologist fromNew Zealand, Grace Alpe, who arrived at Flag Base with terminal cancer. “Shelooked like a witch, with gray hair and a hooked nose, like she was in a hauntedhouse,” said Karen de la Carriere, who was Alpe’s auditor. During auditingsessions Alpe would just rock back and forth, crying, “I’m going to die! I’m goingto die!” Everyone kept a distance from the woman, except Quentin, who tookover her case. He actually let her move into his room and sleep in his bed, whilehe slept on the floor. Then he made a catastrophic mistake.Dennis Erlich, the chief “cramming oɽcer” at Flag, who supervised the upper-level auditors, noted jarring disparities between Quentin’s upbeat reports onAlpe and her glaring lack of progress. Erlich called Quentin in for a meeting.“Quentin, or ‘Q’ as his friends called him, was 22 at the time,” Erlich laterwrote. “He looked 15 and acted 5.” During the interview, Quentin continuallyzoomed his hand through the air and made airplane noises. He calmly told Erlichthat he had falsely reported the results. “I think a lot of my father’s stuʃ doesn’twork,” he said. “So I false report whenever I need to. Personally, I think my"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"father’s crazy.”Not only was Quentin the founder’s son, he was also one of the highest-rankedauditors in the church, and yet he had committed an unpardonable oʃense.Erlich had no choice but to tell him that he would have to surrender all of histraining certiɹcates and start the entire Scientology series all over again—yearsof work. Quentin seemed completely nonchalant.What happened after this is full of contradiction and mystery. Tracy Ekstrand,who was Quentin’s steward, set a cookie on his bedside table that evening. Itwas still there the next night. The bed had not been slept in. Erlich wasexpecting Quentin to show up to go over his new training program, but he didn’tappear that day or the next. Word went out that Quentin had “blown”—in otherwords, he had ɻed. He left a confused note, full of references to UFOs, sayingthat he was going to Area 51, the secret airbase north of Las Vegas, Nevada,where the CIA has developed spy planes; in popular culture, Area 51 was said tobe where an alien spacecraft was stored. Quentin had only just learned to drivea car, in the parking garage of the condominium, where he accidentally ran intothe wall with such force that the entire building registered the shock. He wasscarcely qualiɹed to drive all the way across the country by himself. Quentinhad repeatedly requested a leave to take ɻying lessons, but Hubbard wasconvinced that Quentin couldn’t be trusted to ɻy a plane under anycircumstances.Frantic, Mary Sue dispatched three hundred Guardian’s Oɽce operatives toɹnd him. Weeks passed, as the Scientologists checked hotels and ɻying schoolsin multiple states. A cover story was put out that Quentin had been given ɻyinglessons as a present from his parents, and he was driving to California to fulɹllhis lifelong ambition.Quentin was indeed headed for Nevada. It was one of the very few times inhis life when he was on his own and free. He stopped in St. Louis on his drivewest and took a VIP tour of the giant aerospace manufacturer McDonnellDouglas. He was enthralled by the display of aircraft and artifacts of theMercury and Gemini space programs; he even got a ride in one of the company’sbusiness jets. “He was so happy,” Cindy Mallien, who had lunch with him thatafternoon, recalled. “He was just beaming.”But only a few days later, Las Vegas police were trying to identify a slightyoung man with blond hair and a reddish moustache who had been discoveredcomatose in a car parked on Sunset Road facing the end of the runway ofMcCarran Airport. He was naked. He was ɹve feet one inch tall, and weighedjust over a hundred pounds. There were no identifying marks on his body and"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"no personal identiɹcation. The license plates had been removed. The engine ofthe white Pontiac was still running when he was discovered. The windows wererolled up, and a vacuum tube led from the exhaust through the passenger’s ventwindow. Two weeks later, on November 12, 1976, the young man died withoutregaining consciousness. Las Vegas police were ɹnally able to connect thePontiac with Quentin through a Florida smog sticker and the vehicleidentification number.An agent from the Guardian’s Oɽce came into Hubbard’s oɽce in La Quintaas he was having breakfast and handed him the report on Quentin’s death. “Thatlittle shit has done it to me again!” Hubbard cried. He threw the report at KimaDouglas and ordered her to read it. The report said Quentin had died ofasphyxiation of carbon monoxide. It also noted that there was semen in hisrectum. When Hubbard told Mary Sue that Quentin was dead, she screamed forten minutes. For months, she was disconsolate, hiding behind dark glasses.Everyone knew that Quentin was her favorite.A spokesman for the church said that Quentin had been on vacation.Meantime, Mary Sue arranged for three further autopsies to be performed. Inthe last one, the cause of death was said to be unknown. She put out the wordthat he had died of encephalitis. Hubbard himself was convinced that Quentinwas murdered as a way of getting at him.1 Harriet Whitehead, an anthropologist who conducted ɹeldwork in Scientology in the United States andthe United Kingdom between 1969 and 1971, writes of the “fundamental kinship” between psychotherapyand religion. “The cosmological system that surrounds a renunciatory discipline cannot for long remain‘secular,’ that is, ɹnite and this-worldly, in its orientation,” she writes. “This is one of the reasons ... seculartherapeutic doctrines often develop a religious or mystical cast.” Although Freud was a nonreligious Jew,the techniques of analysis he developed may have had their roots in certain mystical practices rooted in thekabbalah, such as the interpretation of dreams and the use of free association to uncover hiddenmotivations. Jung subsequently steered psychoanalysis into deeply spiritual waters—a course, as Whiteheadpoints out, that parallels the evolution of Dianetics into Scientology: “It would thus be facile to dismiss thepromulgation of a quasi-empirical supernaturalism in the Dianetics movement as simply the product ofamateur theorizing by a spinner of tales, when Hubbard’s predecessors who established the frameworkwithin which psychotherapy, amateur and otherwise, would subsequently develop, did hardly any better”(Whitehead, Renunciation and Reformulation, pp. 27–8).2 A federal district court eventually allowed E-Meters to be used for “bona ɹde religious counseling,” butordered that each device bear a warning that “the E-Meter is not medically or scientiɹcally useful for the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"diagnosis, treatment or prevention of any disease. It is not medically or scientiɹcally capable of improvingthe health or bodily functions of anyone” (Amended Order of US District Court for the District of Columbia,No.71–2064, Mar. 1, 1973).3 The ban was repealed in 1973.4 According to the church, “The ɹrst Sea Organization members formulated a one-billion-year pledge tosymbolize their eternal commitment to the religion and it is still signed by all members today. It is asymbolic document which, similar to vows of dedication in other faiths and orders, serves to signify anindividual’s eternal commitment to the goals, purposes and principles of the Scientology religion.”5 The church explained, “As it became a matter of tradition among the crew members at that time havingadopted the practice of overboarding, Mr. Hubbard set forth rules in October of 1968 to ensure it wasconducted safely in attaining the spiritual beneɹt intended. To that end, given that it was an ecclesiasticalpenance, the procedure includes the Chaplain making the following statement as part of the observance:‘We commit your sins and errors to the waves and trust you will arise a better thetan.’ ”6 The church denies that Scientologists worked with General Oufkir’s men or used the E-Meter to providesecurity checking for the Moroccan government.7 The church supplied me with a number of aɽdavits from former Sea Org members saying that they hadnot been forced to terminate their pregnancies.8 The CIA at the time was taking note of Hubbard, mainly through newspaper clippings. “There is noindication that HUBBARD or members of his organization have been engaged in intelligence or securitymatters,” an agency dispatch notes. “Rather, HUBBARD appears to be a shrewd businessman who hasparlayed his Scientology ‘religion’ into a multi-million dollar business by taking advantage of that portionof society prone to fall for such gimmicks” (“Scientology/L. Ron HUBBARD,” CIA dispatch, Mar. 18, 1971)."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"D4The Faith Factoryespite its reputation for carnality and narcissism, Los Angeles has alwaysbeen a spawning ground for new religions. In 1906, a one-eyed blackpreacher named William Seymour set up a church in a livery stable onAzusa Street and began a revival that lasted for three years. Hundreds ofthousands of pilgrims came to hear his message. Stigmatized as Holy Rollers anddecried because of their interracial worship, Seymour’s followers gave birth tothe Pentecostal movement, which quickly spread across the world, becoming anenduring force in modern Christianity. In 1912, a theosophist colony calledKrotona took root just below the current Hollywood sign, where the hills weresaid to be “magnetically impregnated.” An organization called Mighty I AMPresence began in Los Angeles and expanded all across America, gaining about amillion followers by 1938. The founders were Guy and Edna Ballard, whoclaimed to be able to communicate with “ascended masters.” Guy wrote apopular book titled Unveiled Mysteries, in which he related his travels throughthe stratosphere, visiting great cities of antiquity and unearthing buried loot—much as Hubbard attempted to do several decades later. Writers William ButlerYeats, D. H. Lawrence, Christopher Isherwood, and Aldous Huxley passedthrough the city, all drawn by its reputation as a center for spiritual innovation.One of the most famous preachers in American history, Aimee SempleMcPherson, built the Angelus Temple near Echo Park in 1923, where shemarried Pentecostalism with Hollywood theatricality. She created sets for hersermons on a stage designed for her by Charlie Chaplin, who may have been oneof her secret Hollywood paramours (Milton Berle claimed to be another).Anticipating the garb of Hubbard and the Sea Org, McPherson liked to dress inan admiral’s uniform, while her disciples wore nautical outɹts. As a teenager,Anthony Quinn played the saxophone in the church and translated for SisterAimee when she preached in Mexican neighborhoods. After he became a moviestar, Quinn would compare her to the great actresses he worked with, includingIngrid Bergman and Katharine Hepburn. “They all fell short of that ɹrst electricshock Aimee Semple McPherson produced in me.”And so when the Church of Scientology was oɽcially founded in Los Angeles,"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"in February 1954, by several of Hubbard’s devoted followers, there was alreadya history of religious celebrities and celebrity religions. The cultivation offamous people—or people who aspired to be famous—was a feature ofHubbard’s grand design. He foresaw that the best way of promoting Scientologyas a ladder to enlightenment was to court celebrities, whom he deɹned as “anyperson important enough in his ɹeld or an opinion leader or his entourage,business associates, family or friends with particular attention to the arts, sportsand management and government.” It was not surprising that Hubbard wouldhire as his personal assistant Richard de Mille, son of the legendary producerand director Cecil B. DeMille, who had started Paramount Pictures and was insome ways responsible for the creation of Hollywood itself.In 1955, a year after the church’s founding, an editorial in Ability, apublication aɽliated with the church, urged Scientologists to recruit celebrities.A long list of desirable prospects followed, including Marlene Dietrich, WaltDisney, Jackie Gleason, John Ford, Bob Hope, and Howard Hughes. “If youwant one of these celebrities as your game, write us at once so the notable willbe yours to hunt without interference,” the editorial promised. “If you bring oneof them home you will get a small plaque as your reward.” Author WilliamBurroughs and actor Stephen Boyd were drawn into the church in its early days.Scientology was a religion rather perfectly calibrated for its time and place,since American culture, and soon the rest of the world, was bending increasinglytoward the worship of celebrity, with Hollywood as its chief shrine. At the endof the sixties, the church established its ɹrst Celebrity Centre, in Hollywood.(There are now satellites in Paris, Vienna, Düsseldorf, Munich, Florence,London, New York, Las Vegas, and Nashville.) The object was to “makecelebrities even better known and to help their careers with Scientology,”Hubbard wrote. “By accomplishing this Major Target I know that CelebrityCentres can take over the whole acting-artists world.”Hubbard was particularly interested in stars whose careers had crested butstill had enough luster that they could be rehabilitated and made into icons ofScientology. The prototype was Gloria Swanson, one of the greatest stars of thesilent movie era, who personiɹed the lavish glamour of that era. Although shenever regained the international fame she had known before the talkies, shecontinued acting on television and in occasional movies—most memorably, asNorma Desmond in the 1950 classic Sunset Boulevard. Hubbard’s top auditor,Peggy Conway, a South African entertainer, ardently cultivated Swanson, callingher “My Adorable Glory,” in her many letters to the star, although she saves herhighest praise for Hubbard, who was also her auditor: “The Master did his"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Sunday best on me,” she wrote Swanson in 1956. “He never went to bed—wetalked the clock around—day after day—night after night—I was six thousandlight years above Arcturus—what a genius is our Great Red Father!”A constant stream of aspiring young actors, writers, and directors came toHollywood with common dreams, trying to leverage whatever ability or looksthey might have in a market already overwhelmed by beautiful and talented andchronically unemployed young people. Many of them were rather poorlyeducated—they had left school to gamble on stardom—but they were smart,talented, and desperately ambitious. Scientology promised these neophytes anentry into the gated community of celebrity. The church claimed to have amethod for getting ahead; just as enticing was the whispered assertion that anetwork of Scientologists existed at the upper levels of the entertainmentindustry eager to advance like-minded believers—a claim that never had muchto support it, but was not entirely untrue. Scientology was a small but growingsubculture in the Hollywood studios.Kirstie Alley was an aspiring actress from Wichita who left the University ofKansas in her sophomore year, then struggled with an addiction to cocaine. Shesays that a single auditing session cured her habit. “Without Scientology, I wouldbe dead,” she declared. The testimonials of such celebrities would lead manycurious seekers to follow their example. Posters with the faces of television andmovie stars were placed outside Scientology churches and missions, saying, “IAM A SCIENTOLOGIST...COME IN AND FIND OUT WHY.” In the Hollywoodtrade magazine Variety, Scientology oʃered courses promising to help neophyteactors “increase your self-conɹdence” and “make it in the industry.”Scientologists stood outside Central Casting, where actors sign up for roles asextras, passing out ɻyers for workshops on how to ɹnd an agent or get into theScreen Actors Guild. Courses at the Celebrity Centre focused on communicationand self-presentation skills, which were especially prized in the entertainmentindustry. The drills and training routines would have felt somewhat familiar toanyone who had done scene work in an acting class. Many actors, at onceinsecure but competitive by nature, were looking for an advantage, whichScientology promised to give them. The fact that anyone was interested in themat all must have come as a welcome surprise.Others who passed through Scientology at the same time as Paul Haggis wereactors Tom Berenger, Christopher Reeve, and Anne Francis; and musicians LouRawls, Leonard Cohen, Sonny Bono, and Gordon Lightfoot.

Rock Hudson visited the Celebrity Centre butstormed out when his auditor had the nerve to tell him he couldn’t leave untilhe ɹnished with his session, although the matinee idol had run out of time onhis parking meter. The exemplary figure that Hubbard sought eluded capture.VERY EARLY ONE MORNING in July 1977, the FBI, having been tipped oʃ aboutOperation Snow White, carried out raids on Scientology oɽces in Los Angelesand Washington, DC, carting oʃ nearly ɹfty thousand documents. One of theɹles was titled “Operation Freakout.” It concerned the treatment of PauletteCooper, the journalist who had published an exposé of Scientology, The Scandalof Scientology, six years earlier.After having been indicted for perjury and making bomb threats againstScientology, Cooper had gone into a deep depression. She stopped eating. At onepoint, she weighed just eighty-three pounds. She considered suicide. Finally, shepersuaded a doctor to give her sodium pentothal, or “truth serum,” and questionher under the anesthesia. The government was suɽciently impressed that theprosecutor dropped the case against her, but her reputation was ruined, she wasbroke, and her health was uncertain.The day after the FBI raid on the Scientology headquarters, Cooper was ɻyingback from Africa, on assignment for a travel magazine, when she read a story inthe International Herald Tribune about the raid. One of the files the federal agentsdiscovered was titled “Operation Freakout.” The goal of the operation was toget Cooper “incarcerated in a mental institution or jail.”One of the doors the federal agents opened during the raid in Los Angeles ledto the darkened basement of the old Cedars of Lebanon Hospital on FountainAvenue, newly christened as Scientology’s Advanced Org building. There wereno lights, so the heavily armed agents made their way down the stairs withflashlights. They found a warren of small cubicles, each occupied by half a dozenpeople dressed in black boiler suits and wearing ɹlthy rags around their arms toindicate their degraded status. Altogether, about 120 people were huddled in thepitch-black basement, serving time in the Rehabilitation Project Force. Theranks of the RPF had expanded along with the church’s need for cheap labor torenovate its recently purchased buildings in Hollywood. The federal agents hadno idea what they were seeing. Within moments, a representative of thechurch’s Guardian’s Oɽce arrived and began shouting at the agents that theywere exceeding the limits of their search warrants. Seeing that the Sea Orgmembers posed no threat to them, the agents shrugged and moved on."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"It is instructive to realize that none of the Sea Org members consigned to theRPF dungeon took the opportunity to escape. If the FBI had bothered tointerrogate them, it’s unlikely that any of them would have said that they werethere against their will. Most of them believed that they were there by mistake,or that they deserved their punishment and would beneɹt by the work andstudy they were prescribed. Even those who had been physically forced into theRPF were not inclined to leave. Despite federal laws against human traɽckingand unlawful imprisonment, the FBI never opened the door on the RPF again.Jesse Prince, one of the very few black members of the Sea Org, was amongthose being punished. He had been attracted to Scientology by the beautiful girlsand the promise of superhuman powers. He recalls being told he would learn tolevitate, travel through time, control the thoughts of others, and have totalcommand over the material universe. In 1976, when he signed up for the SeaOrg, Scientology had just purchased the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, part of thereal-estate empire that the church was acquiring in Hollywood, along with theChâteau Élysée and the old Wilcox Hotel, which functioned as Sea Org berthing.The hospital was a mess; there were leftover medical devices and body parts inlaboratory jars; there was even a corpse in the basement morgue. The Sea Orgcrew slaved to convert the hospital into a dormitory and oɽces. One nightPrince was awakened after an hour of sleep and ordered to report to a superior,who chewed him out for slacking oʃ. Prince had had enough. “Fuck you, I’moutta here,” he said. His superior told him he wasn’t going anywhere. “Hesnapped his ɹngers and six people came and put me in a room,” Prince recalled.“I was literally incarcerated.” It was March 1977. Prince was placed in the RPFwith two hundred other Sea Org members, doing heavy labor and studyingHubbard’s spiritual technology. He would be held there for eighteen months.“They told me the only way to get out is to learn this tech to a ‘T’ and then beable to apply it.”The question posed by Prince’s experience in the RPF is whether or not hewas brainwashed. It is a charge often leveled at Scientologists, although socialscientists have long been at war with each other over whether such aphenomenon is even possible. The decade of the 1950s, when Scientology wasborn, was a time of extreme concern—even hysteria—about mind control.Robert Jay Lifton, a young American psychiatrist, began studying victims ofwhat Chinese Communists called “thought reform,” which they were carryingout in prisons and revolutionary universities during the Maoist era; it was one ofthe greatest eʃorts to manipulate human behavior ever attempted. In 1949, anumber of Americans and Europeans who had been imprisoned during the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"Maoist revolution emerged from their cells apparently converted toCommunism. Then, during the Korean War, several United Nations soldierscaptured by Chinese troops defected to the enemy. Some American soldiersamong them went on camera to denounce capitalism and imperialism withapparent sincerity. It was a stunning ideological betrayal. To explain thisphenomenon, an American journalist and CIA operative, Edward Hunter, coinedthe term “brainwashing.” Hunter described robotic agents with glassy eyes, likezombies or the products of demon possession. A popular novel, The ManchurianCandidate, published in 1959, and a ɹlm of the same name that came out threeyears later, capitalized on this conception of brainwashing as being the totalsurrender of free will through coercive forms of persuasion.Lifton’s early work on thought reform has become the basis for much of thescholarship on the subject since then. Lifton deɹned thought reform as havingtwo basic elements: confession, which is the renunciation of past “evil,” and re-education, which in China meant refashioning an individual in the Communistimage. “Behind ideological totalism lies the ever-present human quest for theomnipotent guide—for the supernatural force, political party, philosophicalideas, great leader, or precise science—that will bring ultimate solidarity to allmen and eliminate the terror of death and nothingness,” Lifton observes. Infacing the commonplace charge that psychiatry, or the Marines, or Catholicschools all engage in forms of brainwashing, Lifton developed a set of criteria toidentify a totalistic environment, and contrasted these with more-openapproaches to reshaping human behavior.The totalist paradigm begins with shutting oʃ the individual’s access to theoutside world, so that his perceptions of reality can be manipulated withoutinterference. The goal at this stage is to provoke expectable patterns of behaviorthat will appear to arise spontaneously, adding to the impression of omniscienceon the part of the controlling group. Those who are involved in themanipulation are guided by a sense of higher purpose that permits them—actually, compels them—to set aside ordinary feelings of human decency inorder to accomplish their great mission. Those who are being manipulated maycome to endorse the goals and means of the group—as Prince did—or simplyabandon the will to resist. In either case, the individual is robbed of the chancefor independent action or self-expression.Because the moral climate is entirely controlled by the group, the “sins” thatone is made to confess function as pledges of loyalty to the ideals of themovement. The repetitive nature of these confessions inevitably turns them intoperformances. When the treasury of real sins is emptied, new ones may be"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"coined to satisfy the incessant demands of the inquisitors. In Scientology, onecan conveniently reach into previous existences to produce an endless supply ofmisdeeds. Lifton points out that in totalist hands, confession is used to exploitvulnerabilities, rather than to provide the solace or forgiveness that therapy andreligion seek to provide. The paradoxical result can be the opposite of totalexposure: secrets proliferate, and doubts about the movement go underground.The dogma of the group is promoted as scientiɹcally incontestable—in fact,truer than anything any human being has ever experienced. Resistance is not justimmoral; it is illogical and unscientiɹc. In order to support this notion, languageis constricted by what Lifton calls the “thought-terminating cliché.” “The mostfar-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highlyreductive, deɹnitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed,”he writes. “These become the start and ɹnish of any ideological analysis.” Forinstance, the Chinese Communists dismissed the quest for individual expressionand the exploration of alternative ideas as examples of “bourgeois mentality.” InScientology, terms such as “Suppressive Person” and “Potential Trouble Source”play a similar role of declaring allegiance to the group and pushing discussionoʃ the table. The Chinese Communists divided the world into the “people” (thepeasantry, the petite bourgeoisie) and the “reactionaries” or “lackeys ofimperialism” (landlords and capitalists), who were essentially non-people. In asimilar manner, Hubbard distinguished between Scientologists and “wogs.” Theword is a derogatory artifact of British imperialism, when it was used todescribe dark-skinned peoples, especially South Asians. Hubbard appropriatedthe slur, which he said stood for “worthy Oriental gentleman.” To him, a wogrepresented “a common, ordinary, run-of-the-mill, garden-variety humanoid”—an individual who is not present as a spirit. Those who are within the group aremade to strive for a condition of perfection that is unattainable—the idealCommunist state, for instance, or the clearing of the planet by Scientology.When a preclear voices a criticism of Scientology or expresses a desire toleave the church, the auditor’s response is to discover the “crimes” that theclient has committed against the group. In Scientology jargon, those crimes arecalled “overts and withholds.” An overt is an action taken against the moralcode of the group, and a withhold is an overt action that the person is refusingto acknowledge. Hubbard explained that the only reason a person would want toleave Scientology is because he has committed a crime against the group.Paradoxically, this is because humanity is basically good; he wants to separatehimself from the others in order to protect the group from his own badbehavior."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"In order to save the preclear from his self-destructive thoughts, the E-Meter isused in a security check (sec-check) to probe for other thoughts or actions. Forextreme cases, Hubbard developed what he called the JohannesburgConfessional List. The questions include:Have you ever stolen anything?Have you ever blackmailed anybody?Have you ever been involved in an abortion?There are further questions asking if the respondent has ever sold drugs,committed adultery, practiced homosexuality, had sex with a family member ora person of another race. It winds up by inquiring:Have you ever had unkind thoughts about LRH?Are you upset about this Confessional List?The result of the sec-check procedure is that the person expressing doubtsabout the church is steered into thinking about his own faults that led him toquestion Scientology in the ɹrst place. In the Chinese Communist example,Lifton points out, the combination of enforced logic and clichéd discoursecreates a kind of melodrama, in which formulaic thoughts and handicappedlanguage substitute for real emotions and complex understandings of humannature. Once inside the powerful logic of the group, one drifts further andfurther from the shore of common understanding.According to Lifton, factors such as these award the group life-and-deathauthority over individual members. And yet, despite the Communists’ absolutecontrol of the environment, of the forty victims that Lifton studied, only threewere “apparent converts” to the ideology. That ɹgure has been used to discreditthe notion of brainwashing, although Lifton himself later said that he wasimpressed by the extent to which minds could be altered and “truth blurred tothe point of near extinction.”The CIA, alarmed by the reputed success of Chinese indoctrination, started itsown research into mind control, through a program called MKUltra. In the mid-1950s, the agency began funding Dr. Ewen Cameron, a Scottish-born Americancitizen who was then directing the Allan Memorial Institute at McGill Universityin Montreal. Cameron was one of the most eminent psychiatrists of his time:earlier in his career, he had been a part of the Nuremberg tribunal thatexamined the atrocious human experiments of Nazi doctors; later he becamepresident of the American Psychiatric Association, the Canadian Psychiatric"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Association, and—when the CIA stumbled onto his work—president of theWorld Psychiatric Association. Cameron hoped to cure mental illness byeliminating painful memories and reordering the personality through positivesuggestion. The agency’s goal was somewhat diʃerent, of course; the statedreason was to uncover eʃective methods of mind control and then trainAmerican soldiers in ways of resisting such eʃorts. The CIA eventuallydestroyed the ɹles of the MKUltra program, saying that it had acquired nouseful information, but the real intention of the agency may have been to learnscientiɹc ways of extracting information from unwilling subjects. (After 9/11,documents emerging from the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base showed that themethods used by US interrogators to question al-Qaeda suspects were based onChinese Communist techniques.)The methods that Cameron used to erase his patients’ memories certainlymeet the deɹnition of torture. Electroshock therapy was administered to breakthe “patterns” of personality; up to 360 shocks were administered in a singlemonth in order to make the subject hyper-suggestible. On top of that, powerfuldrugs—uppers, downers, and hallucinogens—were fed to the incapacitatedpatients to increase their disorientation. According to author Naomi Klein, whowrote about these experiments in The Shock Doctrine, when Cameron ɹnallybelieved he had achieved the desired blank slate, he placed the patients inisolation and played tape-recorded messages of positive reinforcement, such as“You are a good mother and wife and people enjoy your company.” Somepatients were put into an insulin coma to keep them from resisting; in that statethey were forced to listen to such mantras up to twenty hours a day. In onecase, Cameron played a message continuously for more than a hundred days.Cameron was a perfect archetype for the evil that science has done in thename of mental health, and in the minds of many Scientologists, his workjustiɹes the campaign the church has waged against psychiatry. It is intriguing tocompare these actual experiments with Hubbard’s mythic vision of Xenu and theR6 implants, in which the disembodied thetans were forced to sit in front ofmovie screens for thirty-six days of programming at the hands of psychiatrists.Although it is unlikely that Hubbard would have known about MKUltra whenit was going on, he had become fascinated by the mind-control scare. In 1955,he distributed a pamphlet, which he probably wrote, called “Brain-Washing: ASynthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics.” For some formerScientologists, “Brain-Washing” provides a codex for Hubbard’s grand scheme.There is an eerie mirroring of the techniques described in the pamphlet andsome Scientology practices, especially those put into effect in the RPF."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The pamphlet opens with what is claimed to be a purloined speech given byLavrenti Beria, the head of the Soviet secret police under Joseph Stalin, toAmerican students studying at Lenin University, on the subject of “psycho-politics.” The term is deɹned as “[t]he art and science of asserting andmaintaining dominion over the thoughts and loyalties of individuals, bureaus,and masses, and the eʃecting of the conquest of enemy nations through ‘mentalhealing.’ ”The text speciɹes how to realign the goals of the individual with those of thegroup. The ɹrst task is to undermine the ability of the person to act and to trusthimself. Next, his loyalty to his family is destroyed by breaking the economicdependency of the family unit, lessening the value of marriage, and turning overthe raising of children to the State or the group. The individual’s trust andaʃection for his friends is shattered by anonymous reports to the authorities,supposedly from people close to him. Ultimately, all other emotional claims onthe person have been broken; only the State or the group remains. “Apsychopolitician must work hard to produce the maximum chaos in the ɹelds of‘mental healing,’ ” Beria says in his introductory speech. “You must labour untilwe have dominion over the minds and bodies of every important person in yournation.”FROM THE PERSPECTIVE of those social scientists who believe that brainwashing is amyth or a fraud that has been used to denigrate new religious movements,including Scientology, Jesse Prince must already have been a convert, or closeto one, before he went into the RPF. Although he says he was attracted to thechurch largely because of the girls, he was aware of the rigors of the Sea Orgbefore he joined it. Perhaps, like the three victims of Chinese Communistthought reform that Lifton termed “apparent converts,” Prince was predisposedto be a part of a totalitarian movement because of his own psychological need toconform, or to be a part of a polarized system that separates all humanity intothe saved and the damned. Such persons, the theory goes, are reared in eitherchaotic or extremely authoritarian homes. They have conɻicted images ofthemselves as being at once extremely good and extremely bad. This isparticularly true in adolescence, when identities are still volatile. Prince didn’tneed to be brainwashed, the theory goes; he was actively looking for a totalisticorganization that accommodated his polarized personality.Some incidents in Prince’s background support this hypothesis. Although hisupbringing was “tumultuous”—his mother died when he was ten—Prince"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"maintained close and loving relationships with his father and his three youngersiblings. After his mother died, however, he began experiencing bouts of totalbody paralysis accompanied by a sense of falling—“like jumping oʃ the GrandCanyon.” The feeling was of helpless, abject terror. Then, suddenly, he would beoutside his body, as if a parachute had opened, and he could observe himselfsleeping in his bed. The intensity of these experiences made them absolutely realto him, but he decided not to talk about them because “if you bring that up, yougo to the crazy house.” Prince now sees those episodes of body paralysis assevere anxiety attacks, but they prepared him to accept the truthfulness of theparanormal powers that Scientology claimed to provide.Brainwashing theory, on the other hand, proposes that strenuous inɻuencetechniques can overwhelm and actually convert an individual to a whollydiʃerent perspective, regardless of his background or pre-existing charactertraits, almost like an addiction to a powerful drug can create an overpoweringdependency that can transform an otherwise stable personality. Stripping away aperson’s prior convictions leaves him hungry for new ones. Through endlessrounds of confession and the constant, disarmingly unpredictable ɻuctuationsbetween leniency and assault, love and castigation, the individual is brokenloose from his previous identity and made into a valued and trusted member ofthe group. To keep alienated members in the fold, “exit costs”—such as ɹnancialpenalties, physical threats, and the loss of community—make the prospect ofleaving more painful than staying.Whether Prince was brainwashed, as he believes, or spiritually enlightened, asthe church would have it, his thinking did change over the year and a half hespent in the RPF. In order to move out of the RPF, a member has to have a“cognition” that he is a Suppressive Person; only then can he begin to deal withthe “crimes” that he committed that caused him to be conɹned in the RPF in theɹrst place. During his many hours of auditing, Prince later related, “You justkinda get sprinkles of little things that seem interesting, sprinkles of somethingthat’s insightful. And then you’re constantly audited and in a highly suggestiblestate ... like being pulled along very slightly to the point where now I might aswell just be here and see what this is about now. Maybe it’s not so bad, youknow?”ONE OF JESSE PRINCE’S COMPANIONS in RPF was Spanky Taylor, an old friend of PaulHaggis’s from his early days in Scientology. She had become close to Paul andDiane soon after they arrived in Los Angeles. She called him “Paulie,” and had"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"helped him market some of his early scripts when he was still trying to breakout of cartoons. From the beginning, she had seen his talent; her own talent washelping others realize theirs.“Spanky” was a schoolyard nickname for Sylvia, but it had such a teasingtwist that she could never escape it. She was the child of Mexican Americanlaborers in San Jose. When she was fourteen, she became a fan of a local coverband called People!, which included several Scientologists. She began helpingthe group with concert promotion, and soon she was working with some of theother great bands coming out of the Bay Area, such as Creedence ClearwaterRevival and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Scientology was just anotherexpression of the political and cultural upheaval of the times. Even members ofthe Grateful Dead were drawn into Scientology, which promised mysticalexperiences without hallucinogens. Albert Ribisi, the keyboard player forPeople!, introduced Spanky to the church. She joined the staʃ at the Santa Claramission when she was fifteen.She was a cheerful young woman with warm brown eyes who called everyone“honey.” Because of her experience with promotion, she was posted to theCelebrity Centre. The place was constantly buzzing with activity—tie-dyeing,fencing, poetry readings—and she loved it. Famous people were always passingthrough, which added to the sense that something fun and important washappening here.Spanky inevitably came to the notice of Yvonne Gillham, who had created theCelebrity Centre in 1969, after gaining Hubbard’s permission to go to LA andescape the tension of his romantic pursuit of her. Gillham came to look uponSpanky almost as an extension of herself, with the same easy, natural ɻair fordealing with people. Even though Spanky was still a teenager, Gillham arrangedfor her to take care of some of the most important ɹgures associated with thechurch.One celebrity quickly took precedence. John Travolta was in Mexico makinghis first film, The Devil’s Rain, a cheap horror movie starring Ernest Borgnine andWilliam Shatner. He got to be friends with Joan Prather, a promising youngactress and dancer, who was one of the few cast members his age. “He glommedonto me from day one,” she said. “He was extremely unhappy and not doingwell.” Prather began talking about how much Scientology had helped her. Actorsare often asked to get in touch with feelings that can be quite devastating.“Dianetics oʃered a tool to get to one’s raw emotions without going completelybonkers,” she observed.“It sounded really interesting, so I brought up certain things about my case"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"and asked if that could be handled,” Travolta later recalled. “And she said itcould. I said, ‘Come on ... could THAT be handled? You know, I couldn’t believeit.” Prather gave him a copy of Dianetics. It helped with his bouts of depressionand insomnia. “Sometimes people say the most incredible things in the world tome that last year would make me suicidal,” he observed. On another occasion heremarked, “Before Dianetics, if people said negative things to me or about me, Iwould cave in easily. Being a man, that wasn’t a very appealing quality. Somepeople would say, ‘The boy is too sensitive.’ But many times I had suppressivepeople around me who would cave me in on purpose. I was sort of like aminefield.”Prather also counseled him using some of the basic processes of Scientology.“I went outside my body,” Travolta later said. “It was like the body was sort ofon its own and I was outside walking round it. I got real frightened, and shesaid, ‘Oh my goodness, you’ve gone exterior.’ ”When he returned to Los Angeles, Travolta began taking the HubbardQualiɹed Scientologist Course at the Celebrity Centre with about 150 otherstudents. He conɹded to the teacher, Sandy Kent, that he was about to auditionfor a television show, Welcome Back, Kotter. After roll call, Kent instructedeveryone to point in the direction of ABC Studios and telepathicallycommunicate the instruction: “We want John Travolta for the part.” At the nextmeeting, Travolta revealed he had gotten the role of Vinnie Barbarino—the partthat would soon make him famous. “My career immediately took oʃ,” Travoltaboasted in a church publication. “I would say Scientology put me in the bigtime.”Gillham adored Travolta and constantly told him he was going to be a star. Toprove it, she gave him Spanky.Although Travolta craved fame, he was taken aback by the clamor that camealong with it. Spanky managed his relationship with his fans. She went to thetapings of his television show, accompanied him to his many public appearances,and persuaded Paramount Pictures to buy a large block of Scientology auditingfor his birthday. She was his liaison with the church—in Scientology language,his terminal (“any person who receives, relays or sends communications”). Shealso became a conduit between the rising young star and other Scientologists inthe industry, such as Paul Haggis, who gave Spanky a spec script for WelcomeBack, Kotter to pass on to Travolta (it was never made).Travolta generously credited the church for advancing his career and givinghim the poise to handle his burgeoning celebrity. “You always have the fear,‘Success is terriɹc now, but will it last forever?’ ” he observed in one interview."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"“When you hit it quickly, you don’t know where it will go.... Scientology makesit all a lot saner.” He introduced a number of fellow actors to Scientology,including Forest Whitaker, Tom Berenger, and Patrick Swayze, as well as thegreat Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov. (Travolta’s friend Priscilla Presleywas the only one who actually stuck with the church.) Spanky Taylor was avisible reminder of Travolta’s increasing devotion to Scientology, as well as thechurch’s investment in his fame, which could be jeopardized by the indiscreetbehavior of a talented but entitled movie star.When the FBI raid on the Church of Scientology took place on July 8, 1977,Taylor was six months pregnant and living with her husband, Norman, in thesqualid Wilcox Hotel. Norm was an executive in the legal bureau. Early on themorning of the raid, he frantically called Spanky and told her to get over toYvonne’s oɽce right away to get the loaded gun she had been given by a friend,which she kept in her desk. By the time Taylor arrived, there were FBI agentseverywhere—more than 150 of them at two Scientology buildings, the AdvancedOrg and Château Élysée. It was the largest FBI raid in history, and it went on allday and night. They brought battering rams and sledgehammers to break thelocks and knock down walls. In addition to the 200,000 documents they werecarting oʃ—many of them purloined by Guardian’s Oɽce operatives fromgovernment workplaces—they found burglar tools and eavesdroppingequipment. Taylor dutifully made her way through the chaos to Yvonne’s oɽceand slipped the gun into her purse. She didn’t allow herself to think how crazy itwas to be carrying a weapon past all these lawmen.Outside the gates, reporters were clamoring to get in. Just then, a school buspulled up, full of kids from a religion class at the Paciɹc Palisades high school.Taylor recalled with alarm that they were coming to take a tour that she hadpreviously arranged. The wide-eyed teens watched as Taylor explained to theteacher that this wasn’t the best time for the tour. (They never rescheduled.)Within the church, the explanation for the raid was that some Scientologistswere being charged with stealing the Xerox paper they used when they hadcopied the reports on the church in government files—in other words, it was justanother example of jackbooted government goons twisting the Constitution inorder to crack down on religious freedom. But when the indictments came outthe following year, the scale of Operation Snow White was plainly exposed.Eleven Scientology executives, including Mary Sue Hubbard, were indicted inOperation Snow White. Her husband was named as an unindicted co-conspirator,although it had arisen from his original plan.Saturday Night Fever premiered at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood in"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"December. Travolta had spent ɹve months training for the ɹlm, running twomiles a day and dancing three hours a night. He recognized the opportunity thatthe ɹlm provided, and he supplied a singular, electrifying performance. Butwhen he walked down the red carpet past the fusillade of camera ɻashes, helooked dazed. “When I got out of the limo in front of Grauman’s, I wasdumbfounded, I didn’t know how to take it,” he said in a televised interview atthe after-party. “It was like a fantasy, it was like a dream tonight.” He wastwenty-three years old, now an international star. He was also the mostconspicuous Scientologist in the world, after only L. Ron Hubbard himself. Andwho is to say that Scientology didn’t help make his dreams come true?YVONNE GILLHAM HAD fallen ill. She complained of headaches and was losingweight. She wanted desperately to go to Flag, where she could get the upper-level auditing she thought could cure her, but she was told there wasn’t moneyfor that. Instead, she was sent on a mission to Mexico with her husband, HeberJentzsch, an actor and musician who later became president of the church, alargely ceremonial post. They had married ɹve years earlier. On her ɹftiethbirthday, October 20, 1977, while still in Mexico, Yvonne suʃered a stroke.Jentzsch sent her back to Los Angeles, while he completed the tour. After that,her daughter Janis, one of Hubbard’s original Messengers, received a beautifulsuitcase from her. Inside there was a letter, but it made no sense. Janis tried toɹnd out what was wrong, but no one would say. Her sister, Terri, went to theSea Org berthing and found Yvonne lying in her room unattended. Finally, shewas sent to a hospital, where doctors found a tumor in her brain, which hadcaused the stroke in the ɹrst place. It would have been operable if she had cometo them sooner, the doctors said.Desperate to get Gillham the auditing she still thought she needed, Taylorwent to the ɹnancial banking oɽcer and begged her for the funds to send herfriend to Flag. “If she wants to go to Flag, she can take the fucking Greyhound,”the officer responded.“You’re Yvonne’s assassin!” Taylor shouted.For her impertinence, Taylor was sentenced to RPF. Her new baby daughter,Vanessa, was taken away and placed in the Child Care Org, the Scientologynursery. There were thirty infants crammed into a small apartment with wall-to-wall cribs, with one nanny for every twelve children. It was dark and dank andthe children were rarely, if ever, taken outside.When she got the news, Taylor cried, “You can’t do that now!” She was"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"thinking of Travolta. He had just called her the day before, saying that he wasarriving on an Air France ɻight after his appearance at a ɹlm festival inDeauville, where he was promoting Saturday Night Fever. Despite his triumph,Travolta appeared depressed and withdrawn. During the ɹlming of SaturdayNight Fever his girlfriend, Diana Hyland, had died in his arms. She was twodecades older than he—she played his mother in a made-for-TV movie, The Boyin the Plastic Bubble—and had already had a double mastectomy when they met.Their romance was doomed when her cancer recurred. Taylor had helpedTravolta through that period of grief, but now his mother, the most importantɹgure in his life, had also developed cancer. Travolta asked Taylor if she wouldpick him up at the airport. She promised him, “Wild horses wouldn’t keep mefrom being there!”The church oɽcials now told Taylor that someone else would meet Travolta.Taylor knew the star would feel surprised and betrayed. He had come to rely onher, both as an unpaid assistant and for emotional support. He wouldimmediately suspect that something terrible had happened and worry about her.Taylor was mortified to think that she would be the cause of his discomfort.The RPF had moved out of the basement up to the top ɻoor of the old V-shaped building that formerly housed the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. Nearlytwo hundred people were crammed by the dozen into old patient rooms inbunks stacked three high. Because of the overcrowding, Taylor was given asoggy mattress on the roof. It was cold. She could hear the traɽc on SunsetBoulevard only a block away. She had a view of the Hollywood Hills and theendless lights of the wakeful city, which was throbbing all around her. So manyyoung people like her had been pulled into the matrix of Hollywood glamourand fame, even if they would never enjoy it themselves. And now, here she was,in the heart of it—isolated, trapped, humiliated, an unnoticed speck on arooftop. Who could believe that a person could be so lost in the middle of somuch life?Moreover, she was pregnant again. It happened a few weeks after she enteredRPF, during a brief marital visit from her husband. There was no maternal careor any easing of the intensely physical work she was made to do with the other“RPF’ers,” as they called themselves. For one two-week stretch, they wereputting in thirty hours at a stretch with only three hours oʃ. Like everyone else,Taylor ate slop from a bucket—table scraps or rice and beans. After six monthson this diet she still wasn’t showing her pregnancy; indeed, she was losingweight. She worried that she was going to lose the baby.A pair of missionaires came to see Taylor one day with a strange request."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"They were thinking about how to reward the RPF’ers for having done therenovations to the Advanced Org building, which were now almost complete.“We would like you to arrange a private screening of Saturday Night Fever,” theytold her.Of course, no one in the RPF had been able to see the movie, despite the factthat it was an international sensation. Getting to Travolta wasn’t easy, however.He was now the top box-oɽce star in the world. Playboy called him “America’snewest sex symbol.” The church hierarchy was worried that he was also driftingaway from Scientology. A screening of his movie would underscore hiscommitment to the religion at a moment when that seemed in doubt.As the church’s liaison to Travolta, Taylor was the obvious person to make thearrangements.“First of all, I can’t use the phone,” Taylor told the missionaires. “Secondly, Ican’t leave the building. Maybe you’d like a Beatles reunion while you’re askingfor that.”“We just think you could take care of this,” they replied.Taylor had to figure out a way to get a print of the film from Travolta withouthaving to explain why she had failed to pick him up at the airport and thendisappeared from his life for months, without a word. A couple of days later, themissionaires arranged for her to use a pay phone on one of the lower ɻoors ofthe building. Taylor called Kate Edwards, Travolta’s creative director at thetime.“Spanky! Where are you?” Edwards cried. Travolta and his productioncompany had been looking for her frantically.“Honey, I can’t really talk,” Taylor said. She told Edwards that she was in theLos Angeles complex. “I’ve been specially selected to do a program that willhelp me,” she explained vaguely. She said she had an urgent favor to ask—aprint of the film.That was a problem. The movie was being shown around the world and all theprints were out. The only one available was Travolta’s personal copy, butEdwards said she would make the request. “Johnny said if you ever called andneeded something, just do it,” Edwards assured her.“You can’t tell John about this call!” Taylor said.“I’m going to have to tell him,” Edwards replied. “I’m going to have to askhim to borrow it.”The next time Taylor was allowed to call, Edwards told her that Travolta hadagreed to loan Taylor the print, under one condition: that he could see her. Themissionaires conferred with their superiors. They decided that as long as Taylor"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"got the print, she could meet Travolta for dinner on the Sunday night after thescreening.1Travolta followed up by sending ɻowers, which were delivered to Taylor inRPF.The screening took place on Saturday night in Scientology’s Lebanon Hall. Itwas a high point for everyone, all the more so because it was followed by adisco dance. Across the country similar dances were taking place, inspired byTravolta’s passionate performance.Taylor wouldn’t be a part of it, however. As soon as the movie was over andthe credits were rolling, several Scientology executives, including Yvonne’sformer husband, Heber Jentzsch, escorted Taylor to an office and told her to callTravolta and cancel their date for dinner the following night.“I can’t do that!” Taylor said.“There have been all sorts of eʃorts to recover him, and we can’t let you getin the way of that,” Jentzsch told her. “Call him right now.”“It’s after midnight!”Travolta was furious when he heard what she had to say. “We had a deal!” hesaid.“I know, I’m sorry.”“How could you do this?” he demanded. “How could you leave your baby?”For the ɹrst time in their relationship, he raised his voice. “My mother died, andyou weren’t there!”Taylor began to bawl so hard she couldn’t speak. She recalled that Travoltawas asking questions she couldn’t answer, questions she had been afraid to poseherself. He seemed to know what she was going through. “Unless you killedsomebody, which I don’t think you did, there’s no reason for you to be whereyou are,” Travolta told her. He had never said an unkind word to her in theirentire relationship, and his frankness was devastating.“I’m doing this so I can be better!” Taylor sobbed. “So I can help you more.”Meanwhile, Jentzsch was jabbing his ɹnger at her and mouthing the order tohang up the phone. She quickly said good-bye and set the phone in the cradle.Then she was escorted back to RPF.All that night she cried and cried, but when the sun came up, she was ɻoodedwith clarity. “I am so fucking out of here!” she decided. “I don’t know how, butI’m getting out.”It wasn’t obvious how she could escape. She had been placed in RPF in March;now it was September. There hadn’t been time to plan because she was workingconstantly. She didn’t know where to turn. It didn’t occur to her to call her"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"parents because she was so apprehensive that she might bring shame onScientology if anybody knew what had happened to her. In any case, she wasforbidden to speak to anyone outside the RPF, even to other Sea Org members.And even if she did escape, she realized, she actually knew very little aboutwhat was going on in the world. Since she had joined Scientology at the age offourteen, she had never read a book that hadn’t been written by L. RonHubbard.Taylor managed to slip away to visit her ten-month-old daughter in the ChildCare Org across the street. To her horror, she discovered that Vanessa hadcontracted whooping cough, which is highly contagious and occasionally fatal.The baby’s eyes were welded shut with mucus, and her diaper was wet—in fact,her whole crib was soaking. She was covered with fruit ɻies. Taylor recoiled.The prospect of losing both her unborn baby and her daughter seemed verylikely.She ɹnally conceived a plan. Explaining to her guards that she had totelephone the doctor, she managed a brief call to Travolta’s oɽce and askedKate Edwards to meet her the next day at a certain time, giving the address ofthe Child Care Org. She hung up without even hearing Edwards’s response.The next day she was allowed a brief visit to the nursery. Taylor put an extradiaper in her purse. She had four dimes, all the money she had in the world, anda toothbrush. Fortunately, Edwards arrived, right on time.Taylor explained to her Scientology escort that Edwards was her sister-in-lawwho had come to take Vanessa to the doctor.“Is this approved?” he asked.“Oh, absolutely!” Taylor opened Edwards’s door and handed her the baby.Edwards stared in bewilderment as Taylor loudly told her to call as soon as shefound out what the doctor said. Then, under her breath, she added, “Kate, whenI shut this door, please drive away as quickly as you can.” Edwards nodded,then Taylor jumped in. Edwards hit the gas.“Spanky, no!” the escort cried.Taylor hadn’t planned any further than this.She was still dressed in a man’s black boiler suit, with the sleeves and legsrolled up. Edwards fetched some clothes from her mother that would ɹt Taylor’semaciated frame and picked up some diapers for Vanessa, then checked them into the Tropicana Hotel on Santa Monica Boulevard. Taylor ɹnally called herhusband in the Guardian’s Oɽce. Another executive picked up the line.“Spanky! They’re looking for you everywhere! Where are you?” he demanded.“I want to talk to Norm,” she said."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"“You need to come back!”Taylor said she would call back at eleven that night. This time, her husbandanswered.“Are they there?” Taylor asked him.“Yes.”She hung up. After an hour or two, she called again. He said he was alone. Shetold him she was out of the church and not going back. The baby was safe, shesaid. Norm wanted to meet, and Spanky ɹnally told him where she was. Sherealized their marriage was probably over, but she felt she owed him that. Normcame over to the Tropicana and they spoke for several hours.The next morning at nine there was a knock on the door of Taylor’s hotelroom. Three Sea Org executives were there to haul her back to RPF.Taylor still believed in the revelations of her religion. She worried that hersalvation was at stake. But she was also gripped with fear that her baby and herunborn child were in mortal danger.At ɹrst, she was ɹrm in telling the men that she wasn’t coming back. “If youlay a hand on me or my child, I’m ɹling charges!” she cried. They assured herthey just wanted to talk. They told her that they hated to see her be declared aSuppressive Person. She would be cut oʃ from any other Scientologist—nearlyeveryone she knew. There was a proper way to “route out,” they reminded her.Eventually, Taylor agreed to return to the oɽce to ɹle the paperwork thatwould allow her to leave the Sea Org on good terms and still be a Scientologist.As part of the routing process, Taylor was given a confession to sign detailingall the “crimes” she had committed. She glanced at the document. Some of theactions cited were drawn from her preclear folders, things she had confessed toher auditors that were supposed to remain conɹdential. She knew how itworked; she says she had once been assigned to go through members’ foldersand circle any “evil intentions” toward Scientology. Sexual indiscretions orillegal acts were always highlighted. These would be forwarded to theGuardian’s Oɽce to be used against anyone who threatened to subvert thechurch. If the crimes weren’t suɽciently damning, Taylor came to learn,scandalous material would simply be manufactured. She signed her confessionwithout really reading it. Later, she was given her bill.The theory of the “freeloader’s tab” is that people who join the Sea Org don’thave to pay for the cost of auditing and the coursework to move up the Bridge.The truth is that there is never much time to take advantage of such instruction.Taylor had been in the Sea Org for seven years, however, and the bill for theservices she might have taken amounted to more than $100,000."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Just before she left the oɽce, the executive handling her case was calledaway for a moment. Taylor took her confession oʃ his desk and stuʃed it in herpurse. When she finally left the building, she tore it to pieces.WHEN HUBBARD FOUND OUT Yvonne Gillham was dying, he sent her a telex asking ifshe wanted to keep her body or move on to the next cycle. She decided it wouldbe quicker just to let go, but she still wanted the auditing. Hubbard agreed to lether travel to Clearwater, to do an “end of cycle on her hats”—meaning that shewould brief her successor at the Celebrity Centre before she died.Hana Eltringham was stationed at Flag, and she was shocked at the sight ofher dear friend. Yvonne was dizzy and frequently lost her balance, and herthoughts trailed away. She refused to take pain medication because it wouldinterfere with her auditing. She tearfully blamed herself for the terrible “overt”of dying and deserting Hubbard. She was desperate to see her children, to saygood-bye, but they were kept away.Hubbard designated Elizabeth Gablehouse, one of Yvonne’s closest friends, totalk to her about the celebrities in her care—who was a reliable speaker, whowas good at recruiting other celebrities. Yvonne talked about various people—some television actors, a Mexican pop singer, the producer Don Simpson, KarenBlack, Chick Corea, and Paul Haggis, among others—but she was particularlyworried about Travolta. “Please help him. He’s especially sensitive,” she said.She advised Gablehouse to deal with the celebrities the same way she treatedHubbard—very delicately, and with an open mind. Gillham died in January1978.Spanky Taylor’s son, Travis, was born that March, weighing less than threepounds, although he was carried to full term. (Both of Taylor’s children are aliveand healthy today.)Many former Sea Org members found their departure from the church to betangled in confusion, panic, grief, and conɻicting loyalties. Many still cling to arelationship with the church, sometimes for years, like Taylor, or for the rest oftheir lives. The coda to Taylor’s story is that a year after leaving the Sea Org,she traveled to Houston to meet with Travolta. He was ɹlming Urban Cowboy atthe time. On her own initiative, she came to “recover” him for the church. Shehad heard that he was having problems in his life, and she worried that her owntroubles had prevented him from turning to the church for help. It was alsopossible that if she brought Travolta back into the fold, her standing in thechurch would be improved."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Like most celebrities, Travolta had been shielded from the church’s innerworkings. The scandals that periodically erupted in the press about Hubbard’sbiography, or his disappearance, or the church’s use of private investigators andthe courts to harass critics—these things rarely touched the awareness ofScientology luminaries. Many simply didn’t want to hear about the problemsinside their organization. It was easy enough to chalk such revelations up toreligious persecution or yellow journalism. “There are two sides to the story,but I don’t know both sides,” Travolta blithely said when he was asked aboutOperation Snow White. “I’m not involved with that.” In any case, for someonelike Travolta, who was so publicly associated with the church, it would be hardto just walk away. He had been asked to declare himself publicly, and he haddone so, again and again.The star was staying in a private house in Houston. He and Taylor met in theevening, after dinner, over a plate of chocolate-chip cookies that she hadbrought. She explained that she had left the Sea Org and was with her childrennow, then quickly changed the subject and asked about him. He described theproblems he was having.Former Scientologists have given conɻicting accounts of Travolta’s stressfulrelationship with the church at that time. The church hierarchy was desperatelyconcerned that their most valuable member would be revealed as gay; at thesame time, the hierarchy was prepared to use that against him. Bill Franks, thechurch’s former executive director, told Time magazine that Travolta wasworried that if he defected, the church would expose his sexual identity. JessePrince has stated that Travolta was threatening to marry a man, although thatwasn’t a legal option at the time. In Franks’s opinion, the church had Travoltatrapped. At one point, the star sought assurance from Franks that his privateconfessions wouldn’t be used against him. “My sessions are protected, right?” heasked Franks. In truth, intelligence oɽcers inside the church had already beendirected to gather material—called a Dead Agent pack—that would be usedagainst Travolta if he turned.In Houston, however, Travolta told Taylor that he didn’t really feel that heneeded to be recovered—he was just taking a break. However, Taylor didpersuade him to buy a costly package of auditing so that he could get back onthe Bridge. He had stopped his coursework after completing OT III.After that, Taylor received a letter from Hubbard saying, “Well done.” Thefounder asked if there was anything she needed. She asked nothing for herself,but begged Hubbard to do a “Folder Error Summary” on Travolta, in which thefounder would personally review all the star’s auditing over the years to spot"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"any mistakes—a tremendous honor for any Scientologist. A Messenger assuredher that it would be done.Not long afterward, however, Travolta stopped talking to Taylor. She got acall from Priscilla Presley, who asked what was going on. Presley had run intoTravolta and he said that they should get together. “I’ll call Spanky,” Presleyhad told him.“No, don’t go through Spanky,” Travolta said.When Spanky heard this, she realized she had been declared a SuppressivePerson. Nobody had bothered to tell her, but from now on, no Scientologistwould be allowed to talk to her.Taylor never tried to speak to Paul Haggis again, worried that she mightcompromise his relationship to the church. For his part, Haggis had no idea whathad happened to Spanky. He wondered why she had just disappeared. ButScientologists were always drifting in and out of his life. Sea Org members, evenfriends like Spanky, might be suddenly posted somewhere else withoutexplanation, or assigned to Clearwater for advanced training, or sent to a secretSea Org base where they were rarely in contact with the outside world. Thatmight explain her absence. He didn’t inquire. He readily identiɹed with thechurch’s narrative that Scientology was being victimized by an intolerant anduncomprehending press, self-serving politicians, careerist bureaucrats, andreactionary police agencies looking for headlines. By publicly defendingScientology, he took on the great burden of scorn and ridicule routinely directedat the church; and in that way, he also allied himself with persecuted minoritieseverywhere: he was one of them.If he had known that his friend had been declared a Suppressive, Haggiswould have had a diɽcult choice to make. It was one he would face soon in anycase. In 1983, Haggis’s writing partner on the TV series Diff’rent Strokes, HowardMeyers, who was also a Scientologist, decided to follow a splinter group led byDavid Mayo, who had been one of the highest officials in the church. Haggis toldMeyers that he couldn’t work with him anymore. Because Meyers was the seniorwriter on the show, Haggis resigned and went looking for other work.1 Travolta’s attorney denies there was an agreement to visit Spanky in exchange for his personal copy ofSaturday Night Fever."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"H5Dropping the Bodyubbard never lost his interest in being a movie director. He wroteinnumerable scripts for Scientology training films, but he still thought hecould take over Hollywood. He had particularly high hopes for onescript, “Revolt in the Stars,” that was based on one of his novels. Inspired by thethunderous success of Star Wars, Hubbard worked on the script in 1979 with thelegendary acting teacher Milton Katselas with the aim of having it made into afeature film.A journeyman theater and ɹlm director before taking over the Beverly HillsPlayhouse, Katselas had directed the 1972 ɹlm Butterɻies Are Free, starringGoldie Hawn and Edward Albert (Eileen Heckart won an Oscar for Best Actressin a Supporting Role). He was a vital link to the Hollywood celebrity machinethat Scientology depended upon. The list of his protégés included Al Pacino,Goldie Hawn, George C. Scott, Alec Baldwin, Ted Danson, Michelle Pfeiʃer,Gene Hackman, George Clooney, and many other now-familiar names. Hisinvitation-only Saturday master class was seen by many young actors as a portalto stardom. He attained OT V status and was one of the most proɹtable sourcesof recruits for the church, receiving in return a ten percent commission on themoney contributed by his students. At one point, Katselas asked if he could jointhe Sea Org, but Hubbard told him it was more important to continue doingwhat he was doing.When Katselas and Hubbard ɹnished the script of “Revolt in the Stars,”Hubbard dispatched one of his top Messengers, Elizabeth Gablehouse, toHollywood to make a deal. After the Moroccan adventure, Hubbard hadappointed her his Personal Public Relations Oɽcer. Gablehouse came from amoneyed background, and she knew how to talk about ɹnances. She shoppedthe script around and found a buyer willing to oʃer $10 million—which, at thetime, would have been the highest price ever paid for a script, she was told. TheGuardian’s Oɽce became suspicious and investigated the buyers, who theylearned were Mormons. Hubbard ɹgured that the only reason Mormons wouldbuy it was to put it on the shelf. Gablehouse wound up being sent to the RPF,and when she balked at that, she was demoted even further—to the RPF’s RPF,"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"alone, in the furnace room under the parking garage of the Clearwater base. Thescript never did get made into a film.Hubbard’s location was a deep secret. Scientologists who asked were told hewas “over the rainbow.” Meantime, a full-ɻedged movie studio, the Cine Org,was set up in a barn at Hubbard’s La Quinta hideaway. With his usual brio,Hubbard assumed that he was fully capable of writing, producing, and directinghis own material, but his novice staʃ often frustrated him. He would do scenesover and over again, exhausting everyone, but he was rarely satisɹed with theoutcome. He walked around the set bellowing orders through a bullhorn,sometimes right in the face of a humiliated staff member.Hubbard was becoming increasingly cranky and confused. He slept withguards outside his door, hiding in the tamarind trees that ɻanked his cottage.One morning he accused the Messenger outside his door of abandoning his post.“Someone came in and exchanged my left boot for a boot half a size smaller,” hesaid. “They even scuʃed it up to make it look the same. Someone is trying tomake me think I’m crazy.”IN AN EFFORT to lighten the mood, several of the crew made up a comic skit andgave a video of it to Hubbard. He was oʃended; he was sure they were mockinghim. “He was shouting at the TV,” one of his executives recalled. “He sent theMessengers to find the names of everyone involved.”One of the perpetrators of the skit was a cocky young camera operator namedDavid Miscavige. Only seventeen years old, Miscavige had already been markedas a rocket within the church. He spent his early years in Willingboro, NewJersey, a suburb of Philadelphia; it was one of the mass-produced Levittownsbuilt in America after World War II. He and his older brother, Ronnie, playedfootball in a children’s league for a team called the Pennypacker Park Patriots.Despite his athleticism, David was handicapped by his diminutive size andsevere bouts of asthma, which caused numerous trips to the emergency room.His father, Ron Miscavige, a salesman at various times of cookware, china,insurance, and cosmetics, was the ɹrst in the family to be drawn to the work ofHubbard. Frustrated with the ineʃective treatment his son was getting for hisasthma, Ron took David to a Dianetics counselor. “I experienced a miracle,”David later declared, “and as a result I decided to devote my life to thereligion.” But in fact asthma continued to aʀict him, and his disease was at thecenter of the Miscavige family drama.Soon Ron and his wife, Loretta, and their four children were getting auditing"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"at the Scientology mission in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Ronnie Junior was theoldest of the children, followed by the twins, David and Denise, and theyoungest, Laurie. In 1972, the family moved to England in order to takeadvanced courses at the church’s worldwide headquarters at Saint Hill. At theage of twelve, David became one of the youngest auditors in the history of thechurch—“the Wonder Kid,” he was called.The following year, in June, Ron and Loretta had to return to the UnitedStates for a couple of weeks. They needed someone to take care of David whilethey and the other children were gone. There was another American studying atSaint Hill, Ervin Scott, whose wife was also aʀicted with asthma. His memoryis that he agreed to let the boy stay with him. He recalls that in the ɹrstencounter David’s parents, along with his twin sister, met with him before theyleft. Scott immediately liked the family. The father was “wonderful and bright,”the mother was “very beautiful, with high aɽnity,” and the daughter was “thecutest thing.” David, however, sat at the end of the couch, unsmiling, with hisarms crossed. The family wanted to make sure that Scott knew what to do incase of an intense asthma attack. “They said, ‘We have to warn you aboutDave,’ ” Scott recalled. “ ‘David has episodes, very unusual episodes.’ ” Theparents explained that Dave became extremely angry when he was suʃering anasthma seizure. “Then they said, starting with the husband, ‘When theseepisodes occur, do not touch him!’ The mother reiterated, ‘Yes, please don’t touchhim!’ I said, ‘What happens?’ They said, ‘David gets very, very violent, and hebeats the hell out of you if you touch him.’ And the sister says, ‘Oh my God, hedoes beat you, really hard!’ ” Again and again, the family members emphasizedthat David had beaten them during an attack.Scott glanced at David, who, he recalls, nodded in agreement. He seemedalmost smug, Scott remembers thinking, “like he was arrogantly proud ofkicking their ass.”Scott was puzzled. He had never heard of asthma making a person violent. Inhis experience, a person in the grip of such an attack was frozen with fear. Hesaid he would heed the warning, however.The next morning, David moved in. Scott took him shopping and then to apub, where he bought him a Coke. Scott also got a nonalcoholic drink. Theychatted with some other Scientology auditors and David began to warm up. Heseemed pleased to be around auditors, but Scott felt that there was “a certainfalseness” in his behavior.They went back to Scott’s quarters and watched television, then turned inaround ten. Scott placed David in the bed by the window, which was cracked to"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"give him some fresh air. David went right to sleep. Scott was used to the rattleof asthmatic breathing, so he soon fell asleep as well.Scott remembers hearing a scream around one o’clock. He jumped up andturned on the light. David was leaning on the bed with one arm. His face wasblue and his eyes were rolled back. Scott had never seen anything like it. Hestarted to touch him, but drew back and performed a Scientology “assist.” Hesaid, “That’s it, David, come up to present time,” repeating the command twice.David blinked and then jolted awake. He was still disoriented, so Scottperformed another Scientology exercise, called a locational: “Look at that wall.Look at that bed.” Slowly, David began to focus. Finally he asked Scott, “Did Ihit you?”“No.”“Whew!”David was still groggy and quickly went back to sleep, but Scott wasunsettled. He watched the boy for another hour before drifting oʃ againhimself.In the morning, David remembered nothing of what had happened during thenight. He got ready to take a shower. When he took off his pajama top, Scott dida double take. He had never seen a thirteen-year-old boy with such muscles.“This kid is built like Arnold Schwarzenegger!” he thought. “A young, very smallArnold Schwarzenegger.”While David was in the shower, Scott took a look at the medication on hisnightstand. He remembers seeing two bottles and two inhalers. One of theinhalers was a typical over-the-counter medication, but all the others containedsteroids. Scott had grown up on a farm, and he had used steroids to treat somediseases in animals, but also to build up the muscle mass in cattle. Could thathave had the same eʃect on Miscavige? (Actually, asthma medications often usecorticosteroids, which do not have the same eʃect as the anabolic steroids thatweightlifters and athletes employ. Corticosteroids can stunt growth, however,and if Miscavige took them might have contributed to his short stature.) Scottdecided to write a Knowledge Report about what he had seen, which would goto the Ethics Oɽcer. “Here is a Scientologist, and he’s taking drugs, and he’shaving these very bad episodes of asthmatic attacks, that can and should behandled by auditing.” He also asked for David’s preclear folder, which shouldhave a record of his previous auditing. He was told that David didn’t have a PCfolder. Scott had never heard of a Scientologist without one.Scott worked with David on some of his coursework and training drills. Attimes, the teenager struck him as highly intelligent, but robotic, and there were"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"some concepts he couldn’t seem to grasp. For instance, with the most basic E-Meter drill, which was simply to touch the meter and then let go, Scott recallsthat David’s hand was shaking. “David, relax! This is just a drill,” Scott said.David settled down, and they continued the drill, but Scott was troubled. Theboy was supposed to be a qualiɹed auditor but he didn’t seem to be trained atall. According to Scott, David admitted that he had never audited anyone andthat, in fact, he had never even been audited himself. “Auditing is forweaklings,” he said. In any case, he said, he was Clear from a past life. Scottwrote up another Knowledge Report.The course supervisor was strangely impatient with Scott for taking extra timeto get Dave through the drills. There was something else that was peculiar, too.A photographer kept following David around. Later, Scott learned that aScientology magazine was preparing an article about the youngest auditor tocomplete an internship in the Sea Org. Scott was complicating matters byholding up David’s progress.Scott remembers that on Monday, David audited a preclear. When he cameback to the room, he seemed agitated, and Scott asked him what was going on.“Those fucking women!” Scott remembers David exclaiming. “There should beno women in the Sea Org.” Scott learned that there were three women whowere overseeing David’s internship at Saint Hill. David’s attitude toward womenwas deeply troubling, as Scott noted in yet another Knowledge Report. So far,no one in the Ethics Office had responded.That changed a few days later. Scott was called into the Ethics Oɽce and toldthat David had complained that Scott was enturbulating, or upsetting, him andcausing problems because of the abundant reports he was writing. “This kid is anSP,” Scott warned, “and you better handle him.” Then he opened the door toleave. David was standing just outside. His reaction told Scott that he hadoverheard him calling him a Suppressive Person. “He went into total fear,” Scottsaid. That very day, David was moved into another room, and his parents soonreturned from the United States. But David avoided Scott whenever they passedeach other.In August, Scott was sitting out in the yard across from the castle and theauditing rooms on the Saint Hill grounds. He was talking to a friend of his, aNorwegian nurse. Suddenly they heard a young woman wailing. Scottremembers looking up and seeing David, his face red and the veins visible in hisforehead. He had a preclear folder under his arm. Behind him was the cryinggirl, who was holding her side in apparent pain. According to Scott the nurseexclaimed, “He beat up his PC!”"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Karen de la Carriere was also a young intern at Saint Hill, and she wasdirected to join the others in the internship room. “They told us that DavidMiscavige had struck his PC,” she recalled. “He had been removed from hisinternship, and we were not to rumor-monger or gossip about it. We weresupposed to just bury it.”David was not done with Scientology, however. At ɹfteen, he went Clear inhis present life. On his sixteenth birthday in 1976, “sickened by the decliningmoral situation in schools illustrated by rampant drug use,” he dropped out oftenth grade and formally joined the Sea Org. He began his service in Clearwater;less than a year later, he was transferred to the Commodore’s Messengers inCalifornia, where once again he quickly captured the attention of the churchhierarchy with his energy and commitment. He rose to the position of ChiefCinematographer at the age of seventeen. After the skit that made such a poorimpression on Hubbard, David redeemed himself in the founder’s eyes byrenovating one of his houses and ridding it of ɹberglass, which Hubbard said hewas allergic to.David Miscavige ɹlled a spot in Hubbard’s plans that once might have beenoccupied by Quentin, although Miscavige displayed a passion and focus thatQuentin never really possessed. He was tough, tireless, and doctrinaire. DespiteDavid’s youth, Hubbard promoted him to Action Chief, the person in charge ofmaking sure that Hubbard’s directives were strictly and remorselessly carriedout. He ran missions around the world to perform operations that local orgswere unable to do themselves—at least, not to Hubbard’s satisfaction.1HUBBARD FINISHED WRITING his thousand-page opus, Battleɹeld Earth, in 1980. (MittRomney would name it as his favorite novel.) Hubbard hoped to have the bookmade into a major motion picture, so the Executive Director of the church, BillFranks, approached Travolta about producing and starring in it. Travolta wasexcited about the prospect. Suddenly Franks got a call from Miscavige saying,“Get me John Travolta. I want to meet that guy!” Miscavige began wining anddining the star. “He just moved in and took over Travolta,” Franks recalled. Buthe says that privately Miscavige was telling him, “The guy is a faggot. We’regoing to out him.”Fleeing subpoenas from three grand juries, and pursued by forty-eightlawsuits, all naming the founder, Hubbard slipped away from public view onValentine’s Day, 1980, in a white Dodge van, with velvet curtains and a daybed.It had been customized by John Brousseau, a Sea Org member who took care of"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"all of Hubbard’s vehicles. The elaborate escape plan involved ditching the Dodgefor an orange Ford. In the meantime, Brousseau purchased another Dodge vanfor Hubbard, identical to the ɹrst. He then cut the original one into pieces andtook them to the dump. The Ford was chopped up and dumped as well.Hubbard brieɻy settled in Newport Beach, California, in a one-bedroomapartment with a kitchenette. In the apartment next door were Pat and AnnieBroeker, his two closest aides. Pat, a handsome former rock-and-roll guitarplayer, enthusiastically adopted the role of an undercover operative, runningsecret errands for Hubbard and going to any lengths to keep their location asecret. His wife, Annie, one of the original Commodore’s Messengers, was a shyblonde, totally devoted to Hubbard.Hubbard soon decided that the Newport Beach location was compromised, sothe three of them hit the road. Pat drove a Chevrolet pickup with a forty-footCountry Aire trailer, which mainly contained Hubbard’s wardrobe, and Anniepiloted a luxurious Blue Bird mobile home that John Brousseau had purchasedfor $120,000 in cash under a false name. The Blue Bird towed a Nissan pickupthat Brousseau had converted into a mobile kitchen. For most of a year, thiscumbersome caravan roamed the Sierras, lighting in parks along the way. At onepoint, Hubbard bought a small ranch with a gold mine, but he didn’t really settledown until 1983, on a horse farm in Creston, California, population 270, outsideSan Luis Obispo, near a spread owned by the country singer Kenny Rogers. Hegrew a beard and called himself “Jack Farnsworth.”Hubbard had been used to receiving regular shipments of money, but after hetook ɻight, the entire structure of the church was reorganized, making suchunder-the-table transfers more diɽcult to disguise. Miscavige ordered that $1million a week be transferred to the founder, but now it had to be done in anominally legal manner. One scheme was to commission screenplays based onHubbard’s innumerable movie ideas. That way, Hubbard could be paid for the“treatment”—about $100,000 for each idea. Fifty such treatments wereprepared. Paul Haggis was one of the writers asked to participate. He received amessage from the old man asking him to write a script called “Inɻuencing thePlanet.” The script was supposed to demonstrate the range of Hubbard’s effortsto improve civilization. Haggis co-wrote the script with another Scientologist,Steve Johnstone. “What they wanted was really quite dreadful,” Haggisadmitted. Hubbard sent him notes on the draft, but apparently the ɹlm wasnever made.Meanwhile, Miscavige consolidated his position in the church as the essentialconduit to the founder. Miscavige’s title was head of Special Project Ops, a"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"mysterious post, and he reported only to Pat Broeker. Miscavige was twenty-three years old at the time and Broeker a decade older. As gatekeepers, theydetermined what information reached Hubbard’s ears. Under their regency,some of Hubbard’s most senior executives were booted out—people who mighthave been considered competitors to Miscavige and Broeker in the futuremanagement of the church—and replaced by much younger counterparts.Miscavige and Broeker would communicate in code on their pagers. At anyhour of the night, John Brousseau, who was Miscavige’s driver, would take himto one of the several designated pay telephone booths between Los Angeles andRiverside County to wait for a call revealing the rendezvous point. It wasusually a parking lot somewhere. The drivers of the two men would wait whileMiscavige and Broeker talked, sometimes for hours.Gale Irwin, who had been on the Apollo when she was sixteen years old andhad risen to being the head of the Commodore’s Messengers Org, began towonder what was going on. Hubbard’s dispatches had become increasinglyparanoid, and his only line of communication to the outside world was throughthese two ambitious young men. Nearly every one of the original Messengerswho had joined Hubbard on the Apollo had been purged. David Mayo, who wasHubbard’s personal auditor, had also been shut oʃ from contact. He, too,became suspicious of Miscavige and ordered him to be security-checked, butMiscavige refused this direct order from a superior. Gale Irwin says sheconfronted him, and Miscavige knocked her to the ground with a ɻying tackle.(The church denies all charges of Miscavige’s abuse.)Brousseau got a call from Irwin. She was agitated. She told him that Miscavigehad gone psychotic. She said she had to contact Pat Broeker right away for ameeting. When Brousseau asked to talk to Miscavige, Irwin began shoutingorders at him, saying that Miscavige was raving and had to be restrained. In noway could Brousseau talk to him! He must arrange the meeting with Broekerimmediately!Brousseau drove her to a prearranged pay phone outside a Denny’s restaurantin San Bernardino, which was used only for emergencies. As they waited for thecall from Broeker’s driver, a black Dodge van came barreling into the parkinglot and slammed to a halt between Brousseau’s car and the phone booth. Thedoors blew open and half a dozen men spilled out of the van, including DavidMiscavige. Irwin says that Miscavige used a tire iron to pummel the pay phone,without much eʃect. Finally he was able to yank the receiver oʃ the cable.Miscavige ordered Irwin into the van, and she meekly acquiesced.With this action, the coup was accomplished: Miscavige and Broeker were"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"now fully and deɹantly in control of Scientology. The founder was isolated,caged by his notoriety and paranoia. No one knew if the orders coming fromover the rainbow were from Hubbard or his lieutenants, but now it no longermattered. Irwin was busted. A year later, in 1984, Miscavige declared her aSuppressive Person, which would happen to nearly every one of the originalMessengers, the most trusted circle of Hubbard’s advisers. David Mayo was sentto the RPF. He was made to run around a pole in the searing desert heat fortwelve hours a day, until his teeth fell out.There was one last obstacle that Miscavige had to remove. In 1979, as a resultof the FBI raid, Mary Sue had been charged and convicted of conspiracy, alongwith ten other Scientology executives, and sentenced to ɹve years in prison,despite the evidence that her health was in decline. She suʃered from chronicpancreatitis, a painful condition that made it diɽcult to digest food. “She wasfrail and thin and completely oblivious to anything she had done wrong,”recalled a Scientologist who escorted her into the back door of the courthouse inWashington. “She said, ‘I don’t want to be photographed.’ That was moreimportant to her than the fact that she was going to jail for five years.”While her case was on appeal, Mary Sue was placed in a comfortable house inLos Angeles, well away from Hubbard. She posed a dilemma for the church, andparticularly for her husband. Hubbard was concerned that he might be indictedby a grand jury in New York that was looking into the church’s harassment ofPaulette Cooper, the journalist who had written The Scandal of Scientology. IfMary Sue were suɽciently alienated to implicate Hubbard, Scientology wouldbe devastated. Hubbard dictated frequent letters telling her what to say toprosecutors; the letters would be read to her and then destroyed. A crew ofMessengers spent weeks sorting through all the orders and correspondencerelating to Operation Snow White and other possible criminal activity that theFBI had not seized, making sure that Hubbard’s name was excised from anydamning evidence.Mary Sue still commanded the loyalty and aʃection of many Scientologistswho saw her as a martyr. Moreover, she refused to divorce Hubbard or to resignher position as head of the Guardian’s Oɽce. The sprawling intelligenceapparatus that she built still operated in secret, behind locked doors. TheCommodore’s Messengers Org and the Guardian’s Oɽce were parallel andsometimes competing arms of their founders, and they had often struggled forpower, in a kind of bureaucratic marital spat. Now that Miscavige was fully incontrol of the CMO, he concluded that the GO had to be ripped out of MarySue’s grasp—but without upsetting her to the point that she sought revenge."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"In the spring of 1981, a delegation of Commodore’s Messengers—includingMiscavige and Bill Franks—went to meet Mary Sue at a conference room in theWestin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. Each of them wore a hiddenmicrophone. Miscavige’s audacious plan was to seize control of the GO andplace it under control of the Messengers, who numbered only about ɹfty at thetime. Several thousand Guardians were still working for Mary Sue. She hadtreated them kindly, paying them decent wages and allowing them to live inprivate homes. Most of them remained loyal to her and thought that she wasbeing made a scapegoat. They would have to be purged.Mary Sue received the delegation of Messengers coolly. Her case was still onappeal, but the outcome was clear: she was taking the fall for a program thatHubbard, after all, had put in motion. She understood the inɻuence she stillwielded in the church and the threat she represented. She demanded to dealwith Hubbard himself, but Miscavige refused. He controlled access to thechurch’s founder so thoroughly that even his wife couldn’t talk to him. Indeed,they hadn’t spoken in more than a year. Mary Sue cursed Miscavige andthreatened to throw a heavy ashtray at him. But her negotiating position wasnot strong, unless she was willing to betray everything she had worked to buildwith the man she still believed was a savior.It must have been galling for her to negotiate with Miscavige, who wastwenty-one at the time—the age Mary Sue was when she married Hubbard.Privately, she called him “Little Napoleon.” In exchange for her resignation fromthe GO, the Messengers oʃered a house and a ɹnancial settlement. Mary Suehad substantial legal bills and no other means of support. Under the guise ofhaving to sort out the messes that would be left behind in the wake of herresignation, Miscavige went over a number of diʃerent subjects, even includinga couple of murders that were alleged to have been committed by a member ofthe GO oɽce in London. He wanted Mary Sue on tape, confessing to othercrimes, which could then be fed to the government. This was done, Bill Franksasserts, with Hubbard’s knowledge: “Hubbard wanted her out of the way. Hewanted all guns pointed at her so he could go about his old age withoutworrying about being thrown in jail.”Mary Sue lost her last appeal. She began serving a ɹve-year sentence inLexington, Kentucky, in January 1983. Hubbard never visited her in prison. Herletters went unanswered. “I don’t believe he’s getting them,” she later reasoned.Mary Sue was released after serving one year. She never saw her husband again."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"MANY PEOPLE WHO JOINED the church under Hubbard would later contend thatMiscavige’s machinations were opposed to the will of the founder. But there isevidence that Miscavige was acting on Hubbard’s direct orders. Jesse Prince saysthat when Hubbard was angry at someone he would command Miscavige to hitor spit on them, then report back when he had done so. Larry Brennan, who wasa member of the church’s Watchdog Committee in charge of dealing with legalaʃairs, had seen how a minor infraction could be inɻated into a major oʃensethat justiɹed the most severe penalty. There were no mistakes; there were onlycrimes. Every action was intended. This logic brooked no defense.Once a week, after Hubbard disappeared, Brennan had to drive ninety milessoutheast of Los Angeles to the little town of Hemet in order to write upconɹdential reports to be sent to the missing leader. The church operated asecret base there in a former resort known as Gilman Hot Springs. Two Sea Orgbases are located on the old Gilman resort, Gold and Int. Gold Base is namedafter Golden Era Productions, the lavishly equipped ɹlm and recording studioset up by Hubbard to make his movies and produce Scientology materials. Int.Base is the church’s international headquarters. On the north side of thehighway, nestled against the dry hills, is Bonnie View, the house that Hubbardhoped one day to live in. Miscavige keeps an oɽce on the property. FewScientologists, and almost no one outside of the church, knew of its existence.The local community was told that the bankrupt property on California Highway79 had been purchased in 1978 by the “Scottish Highland Quietude Club.” Mostof the Sea Org members on the base had no idea where they were; they hadbeen transported there overnight from the former base at La Quinta in adeliberately circuitous route.Gold Base was the only place deemed secure enough for Brennan to send hisdispatches. Brennan says that in late 1982 he witnessed Miscavige abusing threeScientology executives who had made some small error. The three oʃenderswere lined up before their leader. According to Brennan, he punched the ɹrstone in the mouth. The next he slapped hard in the face. He choked the thirdexecutive so hard that Brennan thought the man would black out. Noexplanation was oʃered. This came at a time when Hubbard was furious that hislegal situation left him in limbo, and he was upset about the church’s ɹnances.Brennan had access to all the correspondence coming from Hubbard to theWatchdog Committee, and he knew that Hubbard was demanding action. “Hewanted a head on a pike,” Brennan said."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Gold Base, the Scientology compound in Gilman Hot Springs, California. It includes Bonnie View (center rear), awaitingHubbard’s anticipated return from other realms; the management building (to its right), which houses David Miscavige’s offices;and staff apartments (right front).Brennan says that after the beating, the three executives were held asprisoners on the base.3 They were assigned lowly tasks and Sea Org membersspat on them whenever they passed. Later, one of the three men approachedBrennan, in tears, worried about what might happen to him. “He had to havegreat courage just to speak to me, because they were not allowed to speakunless spoken to,” Brennan recalled. “I had Hubbard’s orders in my hand to spiton him. I couldn’t do it.”In December 1982, David Miscavige married Michele “Shelly” Barnett, a slightblonde, twenty-one years old. She had been one of the early Commodore’sMessengers on the Apollo. She was quiet, petite, and younger than most of theother Messengers at the time—about twelve when she joined—and a bitovershadowed by the older girls. “She was a sweet, innocent thing thrown intochaos,” one of her shipmates recalled.John Brousseau was married to Shelly’s older sister, Clarisse, and one day heproposed that the two couples go ɹshing. Miscavige had never been. They droveup to Lake Hemet, a glacial lake in the mountains above Gold Base. It was abeautiful spring day, the sun was glinting oʃ the water, a mild breeze wasblowing, the wildɻowers were out, and birds were singing. Everyone wasdressed in shorts or jeans. They had brought sandwiches and sodas for a picnic.Brousseau baited the poles with salmon eggs, and then showed the others how"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"to cast. He said to just let the line sink to the bottom and then sit back and wait.Maybe a trout would take a bite.Brousseau recalls looking over at Miscavige ɹve minutes later. He was visiblyshaking, his veins were bulging. “You got to be kidding me!” he said. “This is it?You just sit here and fucking wait?”Brousseau said that was the general idea.“I can’t stand it!” Brousseau remembers Miscavige saying. “I feel like jumpingin and grabbing a ɹsh with my fucking hands! Or cramming the hook down theirfucking throats!”That was the end of the fishing trip.After Quentin’s suicide and Mary Sue’s prison sentence, the remainder ofHubbard’s family broke apart. His oldest daughter, Diana, had been Hubbard’smain supporter. She and her husband, Jonathan Horwich, lived at Flag Base inthe Fort Harrison penthouse in Clearwater, with their daughter, Roanne. As herfather became increasingly remote, Diana decided to try her luck as a singer andsongwriter. She released a soft-jazz album titled LifeTimes in 1979, using notableScientologist musicians, including Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke, as backup.The cover features her in a black dress, lips parted, arms crossed, her paleshoulders hunched, and her waist-length red hair stirring in the breeze.Although the album received little notice, Diana decided to leave her husband,and the Sea Org, and marry John Ryan, a public Scientologist who had producedher record. She moved to Los Angeles to dedicate herself to music. Horwichagreed to the divorce, but he refused to part with Roanne, who was two yearsold at the time. Hubbard strongly supported this decision, but Mary Sue wasopposed. She wanted her granddaughter to be nearby, and she began agitatingfor Diana to gain custody.Several missions were sent to bargain with Diana, but she was unmoved.Finally, Jesse Prince got the assignment. “It was a do or die mission,” herecalled. If he didn’t succeed in gaining clear custody of Roanne for Horwich, hewould be sent back to the RPF. For whatever reason, Diana signed the releasehe put in front of her. Hubbard was thrilled. He rewarded Prince with a leathercoat, a gold chain, some cash, and an M14 assault rifle.Suzette, Diana’s younger sister, was increasingly disaʃected. Quentin’s deathhad been a blow, but the fact that there had been no ceremony afterward—hisname was essentially erased from family history—left her embittered and wary.She longed for the warmth of her Saint Hill childhood, when her mother wouldread to her and her father would laugh and toss her in the air. Those days werelong gone. The forces pulling her family apart were far too powerful for her to"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"resist. She wanted nothing more than to walk away and start a family of herown. But that was not so easily done. She had tried to elope with another SeaOrg member she had met years before, in Washington. “We had fallen in loveand wanted to get married and live together for the rest of our lives,” her suitor,Arnaldo Lerma, later said. He ɻew to Clearwater; they got blood tests and amarriage license. Suzette then confessed the plan in an auditing session. “Shespilled the beans and I got arrested—well, detained,” Lerma said. “I rememberbeing in a room with a chair and a light bulb and two guys outside the door. Iwas interrogated for several hours. I was not struck, hit, or physically abused.However, what I do remember is the deal I was oʃered: ‘We will give you aguarantee of safe passage out of the state of Florida with all body parts attachedif you tell Suzette Hubbard the marriage is oʃ.’ ” Lerma did as he was told,leaving the church as well. Later, when Hubbard learned about another manSuzette was interested in, he paid him to leave her alone. She was isolated anddesperately lonely.She did ɹnally get married to a Scientologist named Michael Titmus, in 1980,when she was twenty-ɹve, but her father didn’t trust him either. Titmus wassent to RPF and denounced as an inɹltrator. Suzette was told to divorce him,which she did; soon after that, she was transferred to Gold Base to work in theHousehold Unit, cleaning rooms and doing the laundry—for David Miscavige,among others.IN 1985, with Hubbard in seclusion, the church faced two of its most diɽcultcourt challenges. In Los Angeles, a former Sea Org member, LawrenceWollersheim, sought $25 million for emotional distress caused by“brainwashing” and emotional abuse. He said he had been forced to disconnectfrom his family and locked for eighteen hours a day in the hold of a ship dockedin Long Beach, California, deprived of sleep, and fed only once a day. Afterattaining OT III status, Wollersheim said, his “core sense of identity” had beenshattered. “At OT III, you ɹnd out you’re really thousands of individual beingsstruggling for control of your body. Aliens left over from space wars that aregiving you cancer or making you crazy or making you impotent,” he laterrecalled. “I went psychotic on OT III. I lost a sense of who I was.”In order to substantiate the charges, Wollersheim’s attorney introducedScientology’s most conɹdential materials—including the OT III secrets—asevidence. At this point, those materials were still unknown to the general public.The loss of Scientology’s chest of secrets was not just a violation of the sanctity"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"of its esoteric doctrines; from the church’s perspective, open examination ofthese materials represented a copyright infringement and a potential businesscatastrophe. Those who were traveling up the Bridge would now know theirdestination. The fog of mystery would be dissipated.The Wollersheim suit had been ɹled in 1980, but Scientology lawyers hadbeen frantically dragging it out with writs and motions. An undercover campaignwas launched to discredit or blackmail Wollersheim’s lawyer, Charles O’Reilly.His house was bugged and his oɽce was inɹltrated by a Scientology operative.There was an attempt to trap him or his bodyguards in a compromising situationwith women. The church also harassed the judge in the case, Ronald Swearinger.“I was followed,” the judge later said. “My car tires were slashed. My colliedrowned in my pool.” A former Scientology executive, Vicki Aznaran, latertestiɹed that there was an eʃort to compromise the judge by setting up his son,who they heard was gay, with a minor boy.When the case finally came to trial, the church stacked the courtroom with OTVIIs. “They thought OT VIIs could move mountains,” Tory Christman, a formerSea Org member, said. Although she was only an OT III at the time, shepersuaded church oɽcials to let her into the room. The Scientologists directedtheir intentions toward the judge and the jury, hoping to inɻuence theirdecisions telepathically.On a Friday afternoon, the judge announced that the OT III documents wouldbe made public at nine a.m. the following Monday, on a ɹrst-come, ɹrst-servebasis. This was the disaster the church had been dreading. When the courthouseopened that Monday, there were ɹfteen hundred Scientologists lined up. Theyɹlled three hallways of the courthouse, and overwhelmed the clerk’s oɽce withrequests to photocopy the documents in order to keep anyone else from gettingtheir hands on the confidential materials. They kept it up until the judge issued arestraining order at noon, pending a hearing later in the week. Despite theseeʃorts, the Los Angeles Times managed to get a copy of the OT III materials andpublished a summary of them.“A major cause of mankind’s problems began 75 million years ago,” the Timesaccount begins. In a studiously neutral tone, the lengthy article revealsScientology’s occult cosmology. The planet Earth, formerly called Teegeeack,was part of a confederation of planets under the leadership of a despotic rulernamed Xenu. Although the details were sketchy, the secrets that had stunnedPaul Haggis were suddenly public knowledge. The jury awarded Wollersheim$30 million.3 Worse than the ɹnancial loss was the derision that greeted thechurch all over the world and the loss of control of its secret doctrines. The"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"church has never recovered from the blow.The other court challenge that year involved Julie Christoʃerson Titchbourne,a young defector who had spent her college savings on Scientology counseling.She argued that the church had falsely claimed that Scientology would improveher intelligence, creativity, communication skills, and even her eyesight. For theɹrst time, much of Hubbard’s biography came under attack. The litigant saidthat Hubbard had been portrayed as a nuclear physicist and civil engineer. Theevidence showed that he attended George Washington University but nevergraduated. In response to Hubbard’s claim that he had cured himself of hisinjuries in the Second World War, the evidence showed he had never beenwounded. Other embarrassing revelations came to light. The church stated thatHubbard was paid less than the average Scientology staʃ member—at the time,about ɹfteen dollars a week—but witnesses for the plaintiʃ testiɹed that in onesix-month period in 1982, about $34 million had been transferred from thechurch into Hubbard’s personal bank from a Liberian corporation.4 One formerScientologist described training sessions in which members were hectored andteased over sensitive issues until they were desensitized and would no longerreact. In two such instances of “bull-baiting,” Christofferson Titchbourne saw theeight-year-old son of the registrar repeatedly put his hands down the front of awoman student’s dress and a female coach unzipping the pants of a male studentand fondling his genitals. The jury seemed most disturbed by testimony thatmembers of the Guardian’s Oɽce had culled the auditing ɹles of members,looking for salacious material that could be used to blackmail potentialdefectors. Christoʃerson Titchbourne had originally sought a $30,000 refundfrom the church. The jury awarded her $39 million. At the time, that sum couldhave bankrupted Scientology.That evening, Miscavige and other members of the church hierarchy had agloomy meeting in a condo in Portland, Oregon. One of the executives vowedthat Christoʃerson Titchbourne would never collect because he was going to killher. “I don’t care if I get the chair,” he said. “It’s only one lifetime.” There was alengthy silence, and then Miscavige said, “No, here’s what we’re going to do.”And on the spot, he came up with the Portland crusade.As many as 12,000 Scientologists came from all over the world in May andJune 1985 to protest the judgment in what they called the Battle of Portland.Day after day they marched around the Multnomah County courthouse, shouting“Religious freedom now!” and carrying banners reading WE SHALL OVERCOME!Chick Corea ɻew in from Japan to play a concert, along with other musiciansaɽliated with the church, including Al Jarreau, Stanley Clarke, and Edgar"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Winter. Stevie Wonder phoned in and sang “I Just Called to Say I Love You” asthe crowd cheered.The most notable presence in Portland was John Travolta. It was a decisivemoment in his relationship with the religion. The church had made enormouseʃorts to persuade him to attend. Two years before the Portland crusade,Travolta had told Rolling Stone that although he still believed in Scientology, hehad not had any auditing for the past year and a half. When asked if he wasbeing exploited by the church to promote its cause, he responded, “I’ve beensomething of an ostrich about how it’s used me, because I haven’t investigatedexactly what the organization’s done. One part of me says that if somebody getssome good out of it, maybe it’s all right. The other part of me says that I hope ituses some taste and discretion. I wish I could defend Scientology better, but Idon’t think it even deserves to be defended, in a sense.”But here he was in Portland, unshaven and exhausted, having ɻown his ownplane in at midnight for a two-hour visit. “Once in a while you have to stand upfor what you believe in, and I’m here tonight, I’ve had counseling, I givecounseling, and I don’t want to lose that,” he declared. “And it’s as simple asthat.”The Portland march was one of the greatest triumphs in Scientology’s history,capped by the judge’s declaration of a mistrial. He ruled that ChristoʃersonTitchbourne’s lawyers had presented prejudicial arguments to the jury by sayingthat Hubbard was a sociopath and that Scientology was not a religion but aterrorist organization. Church members who had been in Portland would alwaysfeel an ecstatic sense of kinship. (A year and a half later, the church settled withChristofferson Titchbourne for an undisclosed sum.)FOR YEARS, Hubbard’s declining health was a secret known to few in the upperlevels of the church. Only a handful of his closest followers were allowed to seehim. He had made no clear arrangements for a successor, nor was there anyopen talk of it. There was an unstated belief that Operating Thetans did notgrow frail or lose their mental faculties. Old age and illness were embarrassingrefutations of Scientology’s core beliefs.Death was a subject that Hubbard rarely addressed, assuring Scientologiststhat it was of little importance: “If you had an automobile sitting out here onthe street and you came out totally expecting to ɹnd this automobile there andit’s gone, it’s been stolen and so forth, you’d be upset,” he said in 1957,reɻecting on the death of one of his close followers. “Well, that’s just about the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"frame of mind a thetan is usually in when he ɹnds his body dead.” The thetanhas to report to a “between-lives” area, Hubbard later explained, which for mostof them is the planet Mars. There the thetan is given a “forgetter implant.” “Theimplant is very interesting,” Hubbard later wrote. “The preclear is seated beforea wheel which contains numbers of pictures. As the wheel turns, these picturesgo away from him.... The whole eʃect is to give him the impression that he hasno past life.” The thetan is then sent back to Earth to pick up a baby’s body assoon as it is born. “The baby takes its ɹrst gasp, why, a thetan usually picks itup.” Sometimes there is a shortage of new bodies, and occasionally a thetan willfollow a pregnant woman around waiting for the moment of delivery so he canpounce. Contrarily, when a body dies, it’s important for the thetan to be freedas quickly as possible—preferably by cremating the corpse and scattering theashes in water, so that nothing clings together. “It’s very confused, this wholesubject of death,” Hubbard observed. “It’s quite funny, as a matter of fact, theamount of this and that that is paid, the amount of ɻowers and that sort of thingwhich are shipped around at dead corpses after the thetan has shoved oʃ, and soon. It’s very amusing.” He presented himself as an expert on the subject,claiming he had been pronounced dead but had come back to life on two orthree occasions.Hubbard suʃered a severe stroke on January 16, 1986, at the Creston ranch.He realized that he was in his ɹnal days. He summoned Ray Mithoʃ, one of hismost senior Messengers, to help him put his aʃairs in order and administer a“death assist.” He didn’t ask to see any of his family members; indeed, one ofhis last actions was to sign a will reducing their inheritance, except for aprovision for Mary Sue, who received $1 million, which may have been a partof the agreement that had kept her from testifying against him. He hadpreviously disowned his daughter Alexis, an embarrassing reminder of hisbigamous marriage to Sara Northrup. Hubbard was in a nightgown, pacing upand down, saying, “Let’s get this over with! My head is hurting!” He signed thewill with a shaky hand.Hubbard also proclaimed Flag Order 3879, “The Sea Org & the Future,” inwhich he promoted himself to Admiral and retired the rank of Commodore. Heinstituted a new rank, that of Loyal Oɽcer, after the stalwart members of theGalactic Confederacy who had imprisoned the tyrannical overlord Xenu.Hubbard appointed only two persons to serve at that level, Pat and AnnieBroeker. They were an attractive couple, his closest advisers; he was clearlypassing them the scepter. “I’ll be scouting the way and doing the ɹrst portsurvey missions,” Hubbard promised his followers. “We will meet again later.”"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"On Friday evening, January 24, 1986, Hubbard died in the Blue Bird bus thathad served as his living quarters for the past three years. Ray Mithoʃ, PatBroeker, and Hubbard’s personal physician, Eugene Denk, were at his side, alongwith a handful of acolytes and employees. His body had suʃered the usualinsults of old age, along with the consequences of obesity and a lifetime ofheavy smoking. Dr. Denk had given him injections of Vistaril, a tranquilizer,usually prescribed for anxiety. Whatever powers Scientology was supposed tobestow were no more evident in the death of its founder than they had been inhis life.Late that night, a handful of senior executives and a couple of privateinvestigators drove to a restaurant in Paso Robles, where they were met by PatBroeker, who guided them to the Creston ranch. The site was so secret that noneof the executives, including Miscavige, had ever actually been there. Theyarrived around four in the morning. Earle Cooley, a church attorney, tookcharge of the body. At seven thirty that morning, about twelve hours afterHubbard’s death, the mortuary in San Luis Obispo was notiɹed. Cooleydemanded an immediate cremation, but when the owner of the mortuary sawthe name on the death certiɹcate, she called the coroner. After learning thatHubbard had signed a new will the day before his death, the coroner ordered anautopsy, but Cooley was able to produce a document signed by Hubbard statingthat an autopsy would violate his religious beliefs. The lawyer did permit thecoroner to take a blood sample and ɹngerprints to verify that the corpse wasactually Hubbard. Many questions would be asked, since Hubbard hadn’t beenseen in public for nearly six years.There was another problem that had to be dealt with quickly: how to explainHubbard’s death to Scientologists. Broeker and Miscavige came up with a plan:Hubbard didn’t die, he had intentionally “dropped his body” in order to move onto a higher level of existence.Miscavige told one of the other executives he didn’t want to see “any griefbullshit.” Sinar Parman, Hubbard’s former chef, arrived that morning, to helpwith cooking and logistics. He found Annie Broeker sitting on the ɻoor of thecabin, with Miscavige’s wife, Shelly. Annie had obviously been crying.Meanwhile, he noticed Miscavige and Broeker in another room. “They werejoking,” he recalled. “They were ecstatic. They’d never been so happy.”That Sunday, Hubbard’s ashes were scattered in the Pacific.The next day, more than two thousand Scientologists gathered in theHollywood Palladium for a special announcement. The news had been keptquiet until then. Miscavige stepped onto the stage. He was twenty-ɹve years"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"old, wearing his double-breasted Sea Org uniform with a black tie and a goldlanyard over his right shoulder. For most Scientologists, this was their ɹrstintroduction to the man who would dominate the religion in the decades afterthe founder’s death. Short and trim, with brown hair and sharp features,Miscavige announced to the assembled Scientologists that for the past six yearsof exile, Hubbard had been investigating new, higher OT levels. “He has nowmoved on to the next level,” Miscavige said. “It’s beyond anything any of us hasimagined. This level is, in fact, done in an exterior state. Meaning that it is donecompletely exterior from the body.” Someone in the audience whistled inamazement. “At this level of OT, the body is nothing more than an impediment,an encumbrance to any further gain as an OT.” The audience began to stir as therealization began to sink in. “Thus—,” Miscavige said, then paused and adjustedthe microphone. “Thus, at two thousand hours, Friday, the twenty-fourth ofJanuary, A.D. 36 [that is, thirty-six years after the publication of Dianetics], L.Ron Hubbard discarded the body he had used in this lifetime for seventy-fouryears, ten months, and eleven days.” Miscavige turned to a large photograph ofCommodore Hubbard with the waves behind him and began to applaud. “Hip,hip, hooray!” he cried, as the audience echoed him. “Hip, hip, hooray!”MISSIONAIRES HAD BEEN SENT to Scientology centers all over the world to coordinatethe announcement of Hubbard’s death. Afterward, they ɻew back to Los Angelesand met at the Liberace mansion in West Hollywood, near the churchheadquarters. Most executives in the church naturally assumed that theleadership had already passed to Pat and Annie Broeker, who were the LoyalOɽcers, the highest post available. That seemed to be as clear a statement ofthe line of succession as anyone would ever ɹnd. Miscavige was not mentionedin the founder’s final declaration.Jesse Prince was at the gathering, having just returned from delivering thenews to Scientologists in Italy. After his lengthy indoctrination in RPF, Princehad become a trusted member of the Sea Org inner circle. He and Miscavigewere friendly. Prince could tell that he was upset when Miscavige conɹded thatsomething would have to be done about Pat Broeker. During the memorialservice at the Hollywood Palladium, Broeker had told the assembledScientologists that Hubbard had made signiɹcant breakthroughs in his research.At that point, the highest level possible on the Bridge to Total Freedom was OTVII (OT VIII would not be introduced for another two years).

Broeker even held up a handwritten page that herepresented as being from OT X. It was a very long string of numbers, which hesaid was a date. It was so far back in time he couldn’t denominate it, except tosay it was “twelve down and ɹfteen across,” about 180 numerals altogether. “Iwanted to show the signiɹcance, the magnitude of what he’s done,” Broeker hadsaid. The audience had tittered in amazement. The little teaser about the OT Xmaterials reinforced Broeker’s standing as the new leader of the church. Only heknew what lay ahead.Every new religion faces an existential crisis following the death of itscharismatic founder. Through his missionary work, Paul the Apostle keptChristianity alive after the cruciɹxion of Jesus. Brigham Young rescued theChurch of Latter Day Saints following the murder of Joseph Smith by leadingthe Mormon exodus across the Great Plains into Utah. Religious geniuses ariseall the time, but the historical test falls upon the successor, whose fate is to beforever overshadowed by the founder. Miscavige knew his own talents andlimitations. He didn’t pretend to be a prophet, nor was he skilled in publicrelations. “People think I’m trying to be the leader,” he conɹded to his brother-in-law, John Brousseau. “That’s not my job. I’m the whip.” Other possiblesuccessors had been purged or had ɻed the organization, however, leaving onlythe Broekers as rivals. Neither of them was a match for Miscavige. He angrilytold Prince that Pat had made a fool of himself at the Palladium. Prince wassurprised. Until that night in the Liberace mansion, he had been convinced thatMiscavige had no interest in leading the church; now he realized that Miscavigefelt compelled to remove the Broekers in order to keep Scientology from beingdestroyed. Whatever reservations Miscavige had had about seizing power hadfallen away.Over the past six years, Pat Broeker and David Miscavige had forged apowerful alliance. Broeker had been on one side of the gate, controlling allaccess to Hubbard; Miscavige had been on the other, acting as the conduit forthe church. Broeker deliberately stayed in the shadows, setting up elaboratedrops for the messages that had passed to and from Hubbard’s hideaway,sometimes adopting disguises and carrying an Uzi machine gun when he left theranch. He fancied himself a crafty undercover operative. The consequence of hissecrecy, however, was that even Scientology insiders knew little about him."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"David Miscavige speaking at the inauguration of the Church of Scientology in Madrid, 2004Miscavige was also well schooled in intrigue.

His fatherwas a graduate of the US Naval Academy. His artistic mother was the daughterof Haddon Sundblom, the illustrator who created some of the most enduringimages in American commercial history—Aunt Jemima, the Quaker Oats man,and the famous Santa Claus drinking a Coca-Cola beside the Christmas tree. TheRathbun family lived in Marin County, a Bohemian enclave just north of SanFrancisco. When Mark was a young child, his mother had a series of nervous"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"breakdowns. On ɹve or six occasions she received what was the standardtreatment of the day, electroshock therapy. In September 1962, when Mark wasɹve, his mother’s body was found ɻoating in San Francisco Bay. Her car wasparked on the Golden Gate Bridge.Mark turned into a restless young man. He went to college to study creativewriting but dropped out in order to experience the real world. In 1976 he wasliving in a camp of migrant workers, hoping to become the next Jack London,when he learned that his brother Bruce had become catatonic and had beencommitted to a state hospital in Oregon.Mark hitchhiked to Portland to oversee Bruce’s care. He carried around abackpack full of books on Buddhism and the works of Jiddu Krishnamurti.Although it is easy to see in hindsight that the nineteen-year-old Mark Rathbunwas primed, because of his troubled background and questing philosophy, tobecome a part of the Church of Scientology, it wasn’t clear to him at the time.His current spiritual mentor, Krishnamurti, preached against the idea ofmessiahs, but he also stated that every individual has the responsibility fordiscovering the causes of his own limitations in order to attain universalspiritual and psychological freedom. That resonated with Hubbard’s aim of“clearing the planet.”Psychotherapy had evolved somewhat from the indignities that had beeninɻicted on their mother; it had moved into pharmacology. But drugs didn’tseem to oʃer a solution to Bruce’s problems; in Mark’s opinion, his brother wasjust being warehoused, held in a chemical straitjacket. Rathbun got a job as ashort-order cook at Dave’s Deli, and each day, when he went to the bus stop indowntown Portland on his way to the hospital, he would pass the Scientologymission on Salmon Street. He would banter with the Scientology recruiters andsoon got to know them by name. One day, he told a recruiter, “I’ve got tenminutes. Why don’t you give me your best shot?” The Scientologist startedpitching the Hubbard communications course, which at the time cost ɹftydollars. It immediately appealed to Rathbun. “The problem is, I’ve only gottwenty-ɹve bucks to my entire name,” he said. The recruiter let him take thecourse, and threw in a copy of Dianetics as well.In that ɹrst course, Rathbun went exterior. It was completely real to him. Allthe Eastern philosophy he had absorbed had been leading to this moment. Heɹnally realized that he was separate from his body. Hadn’t this been the point ofthe Buddha’s teachings—to isolate the spirit and end the repetitive cycle of lifeand death? From that moment on, Rathbun never looked back. He wastransformed."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Another recruiter persuaded Rathbun that he would be better able to dealwith his brother’s problems if he had more training, which he could aʃord if hejoined the Sea Org. Rathbun signed the billion-year contract in January 1978.5A few months later, Rathbun was sent to work in LA. One night, he wasassigned to escort Diane Colletto, the twenty-ɹve-year-old editor ofScientology’s Auditor magazine, from the publications building to the Scientologycomplex in Hollywood where they both lived. It was late at night on August 19,1978. Diane was a petite and mousy intellectual, with thick glasses. A diligentworker, she was often the last to leave the oɽce. On this night, she wasfrightened.Diane’s husband, John Colletto, a highly trained auditor, had recently beendeclared a Suppressive Person. John had gotten into an argument with churchoɽcials over a matter of policy. After being declared, he went to visit aScientology chaplain, who could see that he was having a breakdown. He keptcrying and grabbing his head in despair. At that point, he was forcibly detainedin the RPF. He spent several weeks there, but managed to escape. Diane wasordered to disconnect from him. She told the chaplain that John had threatenedher, saying that if he couldn’t have Scientology, then neither could she.Rathbun—a big man, a former college basketball player—knew nothing of thisas he rode back to the berthing with Diane in her Fiat. She wasuncommunicative. She drove north on Rampart Boulevard, where the Pubs Orgwas located, to Sunset, and then left on Santa Monica Boulevard. It was mid-August, but there was a breeze from the ocean and the night air wasunseasonably cool. As soon as Diane turned the corner from North EdgemontStreet onto Fountain Avenue, in front of the Scientology complex, a pair ofheadlights on high beam blinded them, then a car rammed into them, pinningDiane’s vehicle against the curb.Rathbun was in shock, but he managed to get out of the passenger side of thecar. They had come to a stop in front of a small house with a picket fence. Hesaw the man in the other car get out and run toward Diane, who was still in thedriver’s seat. Rathbun came around the front of the car, just in time to hear apopping noise and the sound of glass shattering. It was the ɹrst time in his lifehe had ever heard a gunshot. Jesse Prince, who was in RPF on the seventh ɻoor,heard the sound and rushed to the windows. People were shouting, “JohnColletto!” Everyone knew immediately what was happening.Rathbun grabbed Colletto, and they spun around in the street. He got Collettoin a headlock, but Colletto pistol-whipped him and Rathbun momentarily lostconsciousness. Both of them tumbled to the ground."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"When Rathbun recovered, he saw Diane on all fours, crawling on thesidewalk, and Colletto running toward her with the gun. Rathbun says he got upand tackled John. They crashed through the picket fence and wrestled on thelawn. More shots were ɹred. At one point, according to Rathbun, the barrel ofthe revolver was pressed against the nape of his neck and Colletto pulled thetrigger. The gun didn’t ɹre, but Rathbun went exterior, viewing the scene fromtwelve feet above his body.Colletto broke free and caught up to his wife. He stuck the gun in her ear.Rathbun says he saw what was happening and did a “ɻying sidekick,” but at thatfatal moment the gun fired.Colletto was knocked to the ground by Rathbun’s blow and the gun skitteredacross the pavement. Rathbun picked it up and tried to fire it at Colletto, but thechambers were all empty. Colletto got in his car and screeched away.Rathbun went back to Diane. Blood was gurgling and spewing from hermouth. He thought she was drowning in her own blood. Rathbun took oʃ hisshirt and put it under her head. As he heard the sirens screaming, she died in hisarms.6Three days later, John Colletto’s decomposing body was found. He hadslashed his wrists and bled to death on the shoulder of the Ventura Freeway.Because of this incident, Rathbun was singled out for his fearlessness, or whatScientology terms his “high level of confront.” Soon after that, he was sent to LaQuinta, Hubbard’s winter headquarters, where the old man was just thenbuilding up his moviemaking enterprise. Miscavige had appointed Rathbun headof what was known as the “All Clear” unit. The object was to resolve the dozensof lawsuits around the country that had named Hubbard as a defendant. He wasalso the target of grand juries in Tampa, New York, and Washington, DC.Hubbard wanted to be able to return to his moviemaking full-time, but he wasafraid to show himself until he was assured that he wouldn’t be hauled intocourt. (He died before that happened.)Like many Sea Org members on the secret base, Rathbun adopted an alias forsecurity reasons, one that was similar to his real name but that separated himfrom his previous identity; it also made it more diɽcult for anyone to ɹnd him.Mark became Marty.AS THE NEW CHURCH LEADER, Pat Broeker quickly sought to exert his inɻuence. Hehad a special uniform made up for himself, with solid gold epaulettes, and a“Loyal Oɽcer” ɻag that was to be ɻown wherever he was in residence. He"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"announced that he was going to issue a new “Grade Chart” on Sea Org Day inClearwater. He justiɹed the alteration of Hubbard’s sacred material with hisown divinations because he claimed to be in telepathic communication with thefounder. His Sea Org Day speech was stymied, however, when he was told thatchurch authorities expected that a government raid would take place if heshowed himself in public. That wasn’t true, but it wasn’t out of the question. Forseveral years, the leaders of the church, including Hubbard, Miscavige, andBroeker, had been targets of an IRS criminal investigation. Church lawyerspersuaded Broeker that while the investigation was still ongoing he shouldconɹne himself to another ranch near Creston that Hubbard had purchased.Broeker was content with that arrangement. He seemed more at home with thequarter horses that he so lovingly purchased with the church’s money than hedid with the bureaucrats in the church hierarchy. He continued shopping forexemplary breeding stock even after Hubbard’s death, claiming he was carryingout the founder’s vision. He seemed to think he could run the church from thesidelines.Other than Hubbard’s imprimatur, Broeker had few assets on his side. He hadthe unfortunate combination of being garrulous without being articulate. Manyof the executives he had been close to had been forced out of the church or hadɻed. Even people who didn’t like him, however, were fond of Annie. She was inmany ways her husband’s opposite. She was measured where he was goofy andimpetuous. Sweet and shy, with a fragile beauty that some compared to theactress Jessica Lange, Annie had been born into Scientology and was one of thefew original Messengers who hadn’t been purged. In 1982, Hubbard had madeher Inspector General of the Religious Technology Center, the highest post in thechurch bureaucracy, in charge of protecting the sanctity of Scientology’s spiritualtechnology. It was a job she was ill suited for, by nature and also bycircumstance, as she was not an auditor, and for years she had been living at theremote ranch as Hubbard’s caretaker, away from the administration of churchaʃairs. In March 1987, Miscavige seized control of the RTC, making himself theChairman of the Board. He downgraded the Inspector General’s post by dividingit into three parts. His new lieutenant and henchman, Marty Rathbun, becamethe IG for Ethics.Still, both Pat and Annie remained untouchable because of Hubbard’s ɹnaldecree. And, most tantalizingly, only Pat seemed to know where the new OTlevels—which he now claimed went all the way up to XV—were hidden. Theywere his insurance. Nothing could be more precious in the world of Scientology—to its members, who sought to gain Hubbard’s ɹnal revelations on the Bridge"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"to Total Freedom, and to the organization, which profited from that journey.At Miscavige’s direction, Rathbun hired a team of private investigators tofollow Broeker and dig into his private life. One of them was a former cop whomet Broeker at a gun show, then began frequenting Broeker’s favorite tavern.He would chat him up whenever he came in. They got to be so friendly that atChristmas the ex-cop gave Broeker a cordless phone. Because such phones emit aweak radio signal, Rathbun’s minions were able to record Broeker’s calls. Thedetectives followed him everywhere, but there was no clue as to where thesecret OT levels might be hidden.Miscavige still worried that Broeker was holding vital material back. A fewmonths later, he and church attorneys went to the ranch to persuade theBroekers to hand over whatever conɹdential materials they might have to thechurch for safekeeping. While this was going on, a gang of a dozen powerfulmen assembled by Rathbun surrounded the ranch quarters and hid in the bushes.Inside the ranch house, Miscavige and the lawyers argued that Scientologywould never get its tax exemption if the church did not have in its possession itsmost important documents. Miscavige also threatened Broeker with the prospectof criminal prosecution. Rathbun had discovered that there was $1.8 million ofHubbard’s funds that Broeker couldn’t account for. Broeker appeared to cave in.He let Rathbun load the ɹle cabinets in the ranch house into a truck. HadBroeker not agreed, Rathbun was prepared to signal his goon squad to storm theplace and seize everything. It took months to sort through the voluminous ɹles,only to ɹnd that there was really nothing there—certainly, nothing thatresembled new OT levels.In November 1987, the IRS notiɹed the church that its criminal investigationhad concluded. No charges were ɹled, but that also reduced the leverageMiscavige had over Broeker. A few months later, Miscavige decided that a ɹnaloperation to retrieve the missing OT levels was in order. This time there wouldbe no subterfuge, no subtle argument. Rathbun brought along a team of armedprivate investigators and oʃ-duty LA cops as muscle, along with several otherchurch executives. One of them found ɹfty thousand dollars stashed under thekitchen sink.Miscavige concentrated his attention on Annie. He took her to a separateroom and interrogated her as a detective barred the door, preventing herhusband from seeing her. Eventually, Annie admitted that Pat kept a storagelocker in nearby Paso Robles, and she coughed up the key. Rathbun’s teamfound more ɹles, but not what they wanted. Rathbun eventually came to theconclusion that there were no further OT levels—no OT IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"XV—it was all a bluʃ on Broeker’s part, a lie that the church would have to livewith, since the levels had been so publicly announced.7In April 1988, Miscavige formally canceled Hubbard’s ɹnal directive, FlagOrder 3879, that had named the Broekers Loyal Oɽcers. Miscavige declaredthat Pat Broeker had fabricated the order, although he produced no evidence tosubstantiate his charge. Broeker’s last claim to the legacy of L. Ron Hubbard wasdestroyed. He ɻed the country, followed by two private detectives, PaulMarrick and Greg Arnold, who claim that they tailed Broeker for the nexttwenty-four years, even to foreign countries. They say they were supervisedpersonally by David Miscavige and paid from church funds. “He lived a veryquiet, normal life, and everybody around him loves him,” Marrick later said ofBroeker. “So that’s his whole story from our perspective.”The same day that Miscavige canceled Hubbard’s order, Annie showed up in aremote re-education camp, in the Soboba Indian Reservation in SouthernCalifornia, that Scientologists called Happy Valley. It had once belonged to anorder of nuns, who left a sign on the gate that said VALLEY OF THE SINGING HEART. Anarmed guard stood watch. Dogs were trained to track down anyone who tried toleave.Miscavige was now in complete control.1 Miscavige has been circumspect about what missions he actually performed in his capacity as ActionChief. He once testiɹed: “What is a mission? Okay. Well, you have a situation and a situation is deɹned as adeparture, major departure from the ideal scene, and at the bottom of that there’s some Y. Y is deɹned as anexplanation that opens a door to a handling. And if you have actually pulled the strings on the situation allthe way down, you will now have a Y, which means that the situation can be resolved. A mission wouldtake a situation, knowing what the Y is, and therefore knowing what exact handling steps are thus possibleas a result of the door being opened because the Y was found by evaluation, and they would ... operate onwhat is known as a set of mission orders, and the set of mission orders is an exact series of steps, sometimesconsecutive, sometimes not, sometimes they can be done concurrently within each other.... These missionorders have an exact purpose to be accomplished, exact major targets, exact primary targets, exact vitaltargets, exact operating targets; they have listed the means of mission communication, and they have alsolisted the target date for completion.” He did not clarify the situation further. (David Miscavige testimony,Bent Corydon v. Church of Scientology, July 1990.)2 The church categorically denies all charges of Miscavige’s abuse.3 In 1989, an appellate court reduced the judgment to $2.5 million, which the church ɹnally paid in 2002,plus interest, which brought the sum to $8.6 million."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"4 The church claims that Hubbard’s income was generated by his book sales.5 Rathbun was never able to apply those advanced techniques on his brother.

Shepherd, County of Los Angeles Case Report, Aug. 19, 1978).7 None of the promised levels has ever been released."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"I6In Service to the Starsn 1986, the same year that L. Ron Hubbard died, Paul Haggis appeared onthe cover of the church’s Celebrity magazine, marking his entry into thepantheon of the Scientology elite. The photo shows Haggis sitting in adirector’s chair, holding a coʃee cup. He’s clean-shaven, with glasses, wearing aherringbone jacket with a pocket square in the breast pocket and pleated linenslacks, looking like a nerdy Hollywood executive with a lot of money to spendon clothes. The article took note of his rising inɻuence in Hollywood. He hadbroken free of the cartoon ghetto after selling a script to The Love Boat, thenascended through the ranks of network television, writing movies of the weekand children’s shows before settling into sitcoms. He worked on Diʃ’rent Strokes,Who’s the Boss? and One Day at a Time. He was now the executive producer ofThe Facts of Life, a top-rated Saturday night staple. Celebrity noted, “He is one ofthe few writers in Hollywood who has major credits in all genres: comedy,suspense, human drama, animation.”In the article, Haggis said of Scientology, “What excited me about thetechnology was that you could actually handle life, and your problems, and nothave them handle you.” He added, “I also liked the motto, ‘Scientology makesthe able more able.’ ” He credited the church for improving his relationship withhis wife, Diane. “Instead of ɹghting (we did a lot of that before Scientologyphilosophy) we now talk things out, listen to each other and apply Scientologytechnology to our problems.”Haggis told the magazine that he had recently gone through the PurificationRundown, a program intended to eliminate body toxins that form a “biochemicalbarrier to spiritual well-being.” For an average of three weeks, participantsundergo a lengthy daily regimen, spending up to eight hours a day in a sauna,interspersed with exercise, and taking massive doses of vitamins, especiallyniacin. In large amounts, niacin can cause liver damage, but it will also stimulatethe skin to ɻush and create a tingling sensation. The church says that this isevidence of drugs and other toxins being purged from the body. Although manyin the medical profession have been hostile to the Puriɹcation Rundown, citingit as a fraud and a scam, Hubbard thought he deserved a Nobel Prize for it."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"In the Celebrity interview, Haggis admitted that he had been skeptical of theprocedure before going through it—“My idea of doing good for my body wassmoking low-tar cigarettes”—but the Puriɹcation Rundown, he said, “wasWONDERFUL. I really did feel more alert and more aware and more at ease—Iwasn’t running in six directions to get something done, or bouncing oʃ the wallswhen something went wrong.” He mentioned the drugs that he had taken whenhe was young. “Getting rid of all those residual toxins and medicines and drugsreally had an eʃect,” he said. “After completing the rundown I drank a diet colaand suddenly could really taste it: every single chemical!” He had recommendedthe Rundown to others, including his mother, when she was seriously ill, andhad persuaded a young writer on his staʃ to take the course in order to weanherself from various medications. “She could tell Scientology worked by theexample I set,” Haggis told the magazine. “That made me feel very good.”The Puriɹcation Rundown is a fundamental feature of Scientology’s drugrehabilitation program, Narconon, which operates nearly two hundredresidential centers around the world. Celebrity Scientologists conspicuouslypromote Narconon, citing the church’s claims that Narconon is “the mosteʃective rehabilitation program there is.” Kirstie Alley, who served as thenational spokesperson for Narconon for a number of years, describes herself as“the heart and soul of the project,” because it had helped break her dependencyon cocaine. A year after 9/11, Tom Cruise set up a program for over a thousandrescue workers in New York to go through a similar procedure, which was paidfor in part by using city money. Many participants reported positive results,saying that they had sweated a kind of black paste through their pores while inthe sauna. The Borough of Manhattan gratefully declared March 13 (Hubbard’sbirthday), 2004, as “Hubbard Detoxification Day.”Kelly Preston has promoted Narconon in her native Hawaii. “Starting in theschools, we’ve delivered to over ten thousand diʃerent kids,” she said. Prestonand Travolta’s sixteen-year-old son, Jett, who was autistic, died of a seizure inJanuary 2009. His parents had taken him oʃ of Depakote, an anti-seizuremedication, saying it was ineʃective. (The church claims that it does not opposethe use of such drugs when prescribed by a doctor; however, Hubbard himselfdenounced the use of anti-seizure medications.) Previously, Preston asserted onthe Montel Williams Show that Jett suʃered from Kawasaki syndrome, a raredisorder that she thought was brought on by his exposure to pesticides andhousehold chemicals.“With Jett, you started him on a program that I think is talked about in thisbook by L. Ron Hubbard,” Williams said, holding up Clear Body, Clear Mind,"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"which outlines the principles of the Purification Rundown.“Exactly,” Preston replied.1 She then talked about her own profoundexperience on the program. Novocaine from previous dental work began tosurface. “I had my entire mouth get numb again for an hour and a half,” shesaid. Other drugs were purged as well, along with radiation exposure from thesun. “I had a bathing suit when I was seven years old—this is completely true. Ihad a bathing suit that I thought was so cool with holes in the side and a hole inthe center,” she said. “And I got a sunburn in it. And twenty years later, I hadthis same sunburn come out in my skin, the entire sunburn.” Preston broughtcopies of Hubbard’s book for the entire studio audience.DESPITE HIS EXUBERANT TESTIMONIAL, Haggis was increasingly troubled by thecontradictions in the church. Scientology had begun to seem like two diʃerentthings: a systematic approach to self-knowledge, which he found useful andinsightful; and a religion that he simply couldn’t grasp. He liked and admired hisauditor, and the confessions were helpful, and he continued to advance on theBridge, even after his unsettling encounter with OT III. He saw so manyintelligent people on the path, and he always expected that his concerns wouldbe addressed at the next level. They never were. After OT III, it was all“intergalactic spirituality,” in his opinion. On the other hand, he had alreadypaid for the complete package, so why not continue and see what happened?“Maybe there is something, and I’m missing it,” he told himself.When Haggis reached OT VII, which was the peak at the time, he still feltconfused and unsatisfied. At the top of the OT pyramid, the thetan was promisedthe ability to control “thought, life, form, matter, energy, space and time,subjective and objective.” The ɹnal exercise (according to documents obtainedby WikiLeaks—Haggis refused to talk about it) was “Go out to a park, trainstation or other busy area. Practice placing an intention into individuals untilyou can successfully and easily place an intention into or on a Being and/or abody.” But even if you could do that, how would you know if you succeeded? Ifyou were transmitting the intention “Scratch your head” and a person did so,was he responding to your psychic order or was it simply coincidental? It wasdifficult to evaluate.Haggis thought that Hubbard was such a brilliant intellect that the failure tograsp these concepts and abilities must be his alone. He ɹnally conɹded to acounselor at the Celebrity Centre that he didn’t think he was a very goodScientologist because he couldn’t bring himself to believe. He said he felt like a"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"fraud and thought he might have to leave the church. She told him, “There areall sorts of Scientologists,” just as there are many varieties of Jews andChristians with varying levels of belief. The implication was that Haggis couldbelieve whatever he wanted, to “pick and choose,” as he says.Haggis’s career was going so well that in 1987 he was approached by EdZwick and Marshall Herskovitz to write for a new television series calledthirtysomething. They were looking for distinctive voices. “I love the fact thatyou guys are doing a show that’s about emotions,” Haggis told them. “I hatewriting about emotions. And I don’t like to talk about my own.” But he seemedto be looking for a chance to push himself creatively. With his ɹrst script, Zwickand Herskovitz told him, “This is really good, but where does it come from?”Haggis didn’t know what they meant. “Where does it come from—within you?”they explained. The thought that his own experience mattered was a revelation.Zwick and Herskovitz sensed that Haggis wasn’t happy on the show; in anycase, he got a lucrative oʃer to create his own series and left after the ɹrstseason. But he had won two Emmys, for writing and producing, and theexperience transformed him as a writer. From working with Zwick andHerskovitz, Haggis became interested in directing. He ɹnally got the chance todo a brief ad for the church about Dianetics. He decided against the usualportrayal of Scientology as a triumphal march toward enlightenment, choosinginstead to shoot a group of people talking about practical ways they had usedDianetics in their lives. It was casual and naturalistic. Church authorities hatedit. They told him it looked like a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous.Then, out of the blue, Haggis got a huge break. He did a favor for a friendwho wanted to create a new series that would star Chuck Norris, whose careeras an action-movie hero had gone into decline. Haggis wrote the pilot forWalker, Texas Ranger, which ran for eight seasons and was broadcast in ahundred countries. Haggis was credited as a co-creator. “It was the mostsuccessful thing I ever did,” he said. “Two weeks of work. And they never evenused my script.”With his growing accomplishments and wealth, Haggis became a bigger prizefor the church. He agreed to teach a workshop on television writing while hewas still the executive producer of Facts of Life, and that brought a number ofaspiring scriptwriters into the Celebrity Centre. Then, in 1988, Scientologysponsored a Dianetics car in the Indianapolis 500, and Paul and Diane wereinvited to attend. Executives from the major book chains were attracted to theScientology reception by the presence of stars, including Kirstie Alley and JohnTravolta, and also by the fact that Hubbard’s books have traditionally sold"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"extraordinarily well. B. Dalton ordered 65,000 copies of Dianetics andWaldenbooks asked for 100,000. Dianetics went back on the New York Timespaperback best-seller list for advice books, thirty-eight years after it wasoriginally published.David Miscavige was at the race. It was one of the few times he and Haggisever met. The organizer of the event, Bill Dendiu, recalled that Miscavige wasnot pleased that Haggis had been invited. Dendiu defended his decision becauseHaggis was now a bona ɹde celebrity. “He has had a string of hit TV shows andby my estimation is a very devoted member of the church,” he told Miscavige.Paul and Diane met Miscavige and other top-level members of the church fordinner. “Paul takes no shit from anybody,” Dendiu recalled. “The fact that hedid not suck up to Miscavige—and in fact, had a couple of little zingers or one-liners for him while we were at the dinner—that got me some additionalbrowbeating.” He added: “You have to understand that no one challenges DavidMiscavige.”The Dianetics car crashed in the ɹrst lap. Paul and Diane ɻew home inTravolta’s plane, with Travolta himself at the controls.SUZETTE HUBBARD BLEW in February 1988.Five years earlier she had met Guy White, a Sea Org marketing executive, onthe RPF running program, which at the time was in Griɽth Park in Los Angeles—about ɹfty people running all day long, even after dinner, stuɽng themselveson bread and honey to keep themselves going. Suzette was warned by an auditorthat Guy was gay. In fact, Guy didn’t know if he was gay or not. When he joinedthe staʃ, he had to respond to a questionnaire that asked, “Have you ever beeninvolved in prostitution, homosexuality, illegal sex or perversion? Give who,when, where, what in each instance.” He had never actually had a homosexualrelationship and had been celibate for a decade; moreover, it was generallyassumed that homosexuality was a false identity, a “valence,” in Hubbard’slanguage, and that such longings would disappear when he got to OT III.Suzette and Guy married in March 1986, three months after her father died.Their son, Tyson, was born nine months and a day later. It was strange having achild on Gold Base. Suzette had been pregnant when the order was issuedbanning Sea Org members from having children,2 and the only other childaround was Roanne, Diana Hubbard’s daughter. Other Sea Org members lookedupon the children longingly. “People could see what they could never have,”Guy White said. The fact that Tyson had been born so soon after Hubbard’s"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"death, and that he had shockingly red hair, stirred speculation that he might be areincarnation of the founder. “Is he? Is he?” they asked themselves.Every church or mission maintains an oɽce for the day Hubbard returns. Apen and a yellow legal pad await him at each of his desks. His personalbathrooms have toothbrushes and identical sets of Thom McAn sandals besidethe shower. On Gold Base, his modest original house was razed and replacedwith a $10 million mansion. A full-time staʃ attends the empty residence,regularly laundering the founder’s clothes and keeping the house ready for hiswhite-glove inspection. His vehicles are still in the garage, gassed up, with thekeys in the ignition. On his nightstand is a Louis L’Amour novel, with abookmark placed midway through. The dining table is set for one.The search for Hubbard’s reincarnated being resembles the quest for the newDalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, although there are few clues about hisidentity. He had prophesied that he would be out of action “for the next 20–25years.” In some versions of the story, Hubbard will be recognized by his redhair, which is why Tyson’s birth aroused such expectations.Suzette was terriɹed that Tyson would be taken away from her. She had littletime with him as it was. There was a Sea Org policy, written by her father,which mandated an hour a day of “family time,” but that had been canceled.Now Suzette was pregnant again. Over a period of days she smuggled toys andclothes via a laundry basket into her little Mazda; then one night she left afarewell note for Guy, grabbed Tyson, and drove to San Diego. A few days later,she moved in with Mary Sue. Mary Sue was living in a house in the Los Felizneighborhood of Los Angeles that the church provided when she got out ofprison. Amid all the anxiety, Suzette had a miscarriage.After Suzette blew, Guy recalls being sent to Happy Valley and being told hewould have to divorce his wife. Jonathan Horwich, Roanne’s father, was also inHappy Valley, along with Arthur Hubbard, Ron and Mary Sue’s youngest child.One night, while Horwich was supposed to be standing guard, Arthur blew andwas never recovered.In October 1988, Guy also decided to escape. Each evening, he went for astroll along the fence line, a little farther each time, carrying a snack for theGerman shepherd guard dogs. One night, he jumped the fence, but the dogsbetrayed him and began barking. He had to dive oʃ the road when he saw thelights of the blow team coming after him. For hours, he stumbled through thebrush, bleeding, his clothes torn, until he made it to Hemet, where he poundedon the door of a bowling alley. In broken Spanish, he told the person whopeeked out that he had been in a car wreck."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Guy ɹnally rejoined Suzette. (They had two other children before he came outto her as gay. They divorced in 1998.)LIKE PAUL HAGGIS, Tom Cruise had been raised Catholic, although he was morereligiously inclined than Paul. His family moved frequently, and he spent part ofhis childhood in Canada, where he had the reputation of being a headstrong,troublesome, charismatic, and charming boy. His schoolwork suʃered becauseof dyslexia, and he later said that when he graduated from high school he was “afunctional illiterate.” However, he excelled in sports and drama. His family, likethe Haggis family, threw themselves into theater, founding an amateur troupe ofplayers in Ottawa. His antisocial, bullying father was a disruptive force in thefamily, and early one morning, when Cruise was twelve, his mother packed upher three daughters and her precocious son and ɻed back to America. “We feltlike fugitives,” Cruise later recalled.Spiritual questing and a tendency toward piety were already features ofCruise’s personality. He spent a year in seminary in Cincinnati, with a viewtoward joining the priesthood. But there was another, intensely ambitious sidethat was focused entirely on stardom. He went to Hollywood when he waseighteen, and managed to get a role in Endless Love, a movie starring BrookeShields. He was a natural actor, but also persistent and choosy, quickly ɹndinghis way into memorable roles. The longing to express his spiritual side hadnever gone away, but it was diɽcult, in Hollywood, to know exactly how to ɹtthat in.There was one church that was especially designed to resolve this dilemma.Cruise’s ɹrst wife, the actress Mimi Rogers, introduced him to Scientology in1986. He had just ɹnished ɹlming Top Gun, which had made him the world’sbiggest movie star. He had little incentive to publicly declare himself aScientologist after the widespread opprobrium directed at Scientology followingthe FBI raids on Operation Snow White and the exposure of the church’s esotericbeliefs. Rumors of his involvement began to mount, however. For several yearshe managed to keep his aɽliation quiet, even from church management. Usinghis birth name, Thomas Mapother IV, he received auditing at a small Scientologymission called the Enhancement Center in Sherman Oaks, which Rogers hadstarted with her former husband. Rogers’s close friend, and former roommate,Kirstie Alley, did her auditing there, along with singer—and later, congressman—Sonny Bono, who had also been brought into the church by Rogers. Cruisewould later credit Scientology’s study methods for helping him overcome his"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"dyslexia.The triumph of adding Cruise to the Scientology stable was fraught withproblems. Mimi Rogers was at the top of that list. Her parents had beeninvolved with Dianetics since the early days of the movement. In 1957, whenMimi was a year old, they had moved to Washington, DC, to work for Hubbard,and her father, Philip Spickler, had brieɻy joined the Sea Org. But Mimi’sparents had become disaʃected by the end of the seventies. They wereconsidered “squirrels,” because they continued to practice Scientology outsidethe guidance of the church. It would be one thing to have Tom Cruise as atrophy for Scientology, but it would be a disaster if he became a walkingadvertisement for the squirrels.When Miscavige learned of Cruise’s involvement in Scientology, he arrangedto have the star brought to Gold Base, alone, at its secret desert location nearHemet, in August 1989. He assigned his top people to audit and supervise theyoung star during his ɹrst weekend stay. Cruise arrived wearing a baseball capand dark glasses, trying to keep a low proɹle, although everyone on the baseknew he was there.Cruise was preparing to make Days of Thunder that fall. He had just seen atwenty-one-year-old Australian actress, Nicole Kidman, in the thriller Dead Calm,and he was so enchanted that he cast her in a part she was far too young to play:a brain surgeon who brings Cruise’s character back to life after he crashes hisrace car. They had an immediate, intense connection, one that quickly became asubject of tabloid speculation.According to Rathbun, Cruise and Miscavige now had a common interest:getting rid of Mimi. She demanded and received a church mediation of theirrelationship, which involves each partner being put on E-Meters and confessingtheir “crimes” in front of the other. But with Cruise ready to move on andMiscavige seemingly set against her, Rogers stood little chance. Marty Rathbunand a church attorney went to her home carrying divorce papers. “I told her thiswas the right thing to do for Tom, because he was going to do lots of good forScientology,” Rathbun recalled. “That was the end of Mimi Rogers.”Rogers later said that she and Cruise were already having diɽculty in theirmarriage. He had been seriously thinking about becoming a monk, in which casemarriage wouldn’t ɹt into his plans. “He thought he had to be celibate tomaintain the purity of his instrument,” she told Playboy. “Therefore, it becameobvious that we had to split.”"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"AFTER TWO YEARS, Annie Broeker had worked her way out of Happy Valley. Shewas assigned to Gold Base, which serves as the headquarters for theCommodore’s Messengers Org; Golden Era Productions, which makesScientology ɹlms and manufactures the audiovisual materials for the church, aswell as E-Meters; and the Religious Technology Center, which enforces theorthodoxy of Scientology practices. Through his position as chairman of theRTC, Miscavige directed the church’s operations, spending much of his timeliving on the base. Rathbun and other top executives were also living andworking on the ɹve-hundred-acre base, which was still so hush-hush that fewScientologists knew of its existence. Rathbun believed that Miscavige wantedAnnie close by, in case Pat Broeker ever stirred back to life.An ex-marine named Andre Tabayoyon, who oversaw construction of thesecurity at the Gold Base, later testiɹed that church funds were used to purchaseassault riɻes, shotguns, and pistols; he also said that explosive devices wereplaced around the perimeter to be used in case of assault by law enforcementoɽcials. Surrounded by a security fence with three-inch spikes, patrolled byarmed guards, and monitored by cameras, motion detectors, infrared scanners,and a sniper’s nest at the top of a hill, the property houses about eight hundredSea Org members, in conditions that the church describes as “like one wouldfind in a convent or seminary, albeit much more comfortable.”Annie resumed using her maiden name, Tidman. Although she wascontinuously under guard, she had fallen in love with another Sea Org member—Jim Logan, the same man who had recruited Paul Haggis into Scientology onthe street corner in London, Ontario. Annie had met Logan in Happy Valleywhen both were on the RPF. Jim and Annie married in June 1990 and moved toSea Org berthing near Gold Base. Logan was no longer the long-haired hippie hehad been in those days; he was now middle-aged and balding, with a blackmoustache, but he still had those intense, playful eyes and a ready laugh. Hisoutsized, boisterous personality didn’t always ɹt well in the highly regimentedlife he had signed up for. In the summer of 1992, Logan was served with a “non-enturbulation order,” which meant that he should stop stirring things up. InOctober, eight men came to escort him to a detention facility wheretroublesome staʃ members were conɹned. Logan was told that he had beendeclared a Suppressive Person and was going to be booted out of the Sea Org.Annie had previously conɹded that she was “ɹnished” with the Sea Org andwould leave if Jim was ready. He didn’t want to go then; he still hoped torehabilitate himself in the eyes of the church, but Annie made application toformally route out of the Sea Org. In a few months, if all went well, they would"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"have a quiet reunion in Nova Scotia, where they could have children and forgetthe past. Annie promised him, “They can’t make me divorce you.” But onOctober 8, 1992, Logan’s last day in the Sea Org, church oɽcials told him thatAnnie had been ordered to disconnect from him. He was served with divorcepapers, given a freeloader tab for more than $350,000, and then dropped oʃ atthe bus station with a ticket to Bangor, Maine.Several times after that, Jim and Annie were able to speak secretly. Shewould manage to sneak a call to him late at night, or he would have his mothercall her. When Annie couldn’t wait any longer to see him, Jim bought her anopen ticket from Ontario, California—the nearest airport—to Bangor. It wouldbe waiting for her to pick up whenever she wanted. A few weeks later, Jim gota call from Annie: she was on her way. It was about ɹve in the morning inCalifornia. She was catching a ɻight that stopped in Denver, then went on toBoston, where she would change planes for Bangor. Jim set out from NovaScotia for the nine-hour drive to the airport.Rathbun got the message that Annie had ɻed the base about an hour and ahalf after she left. He was panicked. Annie knew as well as anyone the insidestory of the secret money transfers to Hubbard, the oʃshore accounts, theshredding of incriminating documents. She could torpedo the church’sapplication for tax-exempt status. She also knew the true circumstances ofHubbard’s last days. She might even reunite with Pat Broeker, and the two ofthem could pose a challenge to Miscavige. Rathbun saw Annie as a potential“doomsday machine.”According to Gary Morehead, the hulking chief of security at Gold Base at thetime, a “blow drill” went into eʃect immediately. Morehead had reɹned theprocess to a model of Sea Org eɽciency. Each year, a minimum of a hundredpeople attempted to escape from Gold, but few got away cleanly. Morehead’ssecurity team kept ɹles on members, containing bank account and credit cardnumbers, family contacts, even hobbies and predilections. When one seniorexecutive ɻed in 1992, for instance, Morehead knew he was a baseball fan. Hecaught him a week later in the parking lot of the San Francisco Giants stadium.Morehead’s team was aided by the isolation of the base—Gold was in anarrow valley in the middle of the desert, seven miles from the village ofHemet. There was a single highway, easy to patrol; mountain ranges enclosedthe base on either side, and the rocky slopes were copiously supplied withcactus and rattlesnakes. Many of the Sea Org members had neither the resourcesnor the skills to get very far. There was an ingrained distrust of the non-Scientology “wog” world and its system of justice, as well as a fatalistic view of"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"the reach of the church, especially among Sea Org members who, like Annie,had grown up in Scientology. Those who had cell phones used them mainly aswalkie-talkies for communication on the base; phone records were monitoredand the phones would be taken away if they were used to make outside calls.Few of them had cars of their own, or even driver’s licenses, so the best theycould do was to try to get to the bus station before they were discoveredmissing. By the time the bus made its next stop, however, there was usually amember of Morehead’s team waiting for them. If that failed, Morehead’ssecurity squad would stake out the houses of the blown member’s family andfriends, using scanners that could listen in on cordless phones and cell phones,and running the license plates of everyone who came and went. When the teamɹnally confronted their prey, they would try to talk them into returning to thebase voluntarily. If that failed, occasionally they would use force.3Most of those who ɻed were torn by conɻicting emotions. On the one hand,they were often frightened, humiliated, and angry. They desperately wanted alife outside the organization. Some, like Annie, wanted to have children, whichshe was forbidden to do as a Sea Org member. On the other hand, they believedthat their eternal salvation was at stake. The youthful enthusiasm that hadcaused them to sign their billion-year contract of service may have beendampened, but there was usually some residual idealism that the security teamcould appeal to. Typically, in these confrontations, Morehead would bring alongthe escapee’s “opinion leader,” which could be his case supervisor, or anotherfamily member who was in Scientology—his wife or his mother, for instance. Inmany instances, the ɻeeing Sea Org member didn’t even argue; he just gave up,knowing that he would probably be taken directly to RPF, where he mightspend months or years working his way back into good standing.At any time, a fleeing member could guarantee his safety by simply calling thepolice, but that rarely if ever happened. The Riverside County Sheriʃ’sDepartment, whose jurisdiction includes Gold Base, says that there has neverbeen an outcry of abuse, or an accusation of illegal detention from members ofthe church at the base. Although the Sea Org members lived inside a highlysecure compound in a desert hideaway, surrounded by fences and high-techsensors, most of them weren’t really being held against their will. On thecontrary, it was their will that held them. But according to Morehead, no onewho escaped ever returned voluntarily.As soon as Morehead learned that Annie had blown, his team began combingthrough her personal eʃects, calling hotels and motels in the area, and lookingfor clues as to where she was headed. The easiest way of doing that was to have"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"someone pretend to be Annie and try to book a ɻight, then be told, for instance,“Oh, we already have you on the eleven-ten ɻight to Boston.” If that didn’twork, another member would call the airlines, posing as a sick relative, anddemand help in ɹnding the missing “son” or “wife” or whatever; if the airlinerepresentative refused to give out that information, the member would continueasking to speak to a higher-up, until he got the information. In one case, it wasthe vice president of an airline who, thinking he was responding to a familymedical emergency, gave up the pertinent details. Morehead also hired formerFBI or CIA agents as private investigators. As soon as an escapee made themistake of using a credit card, the team would know almost immediately wherethe charge was placed. Morehead was always surprised at how easily suchsupposedly conɹdential information could be obtained. His team quickly learnedthat Annie was on the flight to Boston.Minutes later, Marty Rathbun lit out for the airport at a hundred miles anhour. He didn’t even have time to change clothes. He was wearing a T-shirt,sweatpants, and sneakers. His secretary booked a direct ɻight that would arriveat Boston only twenty minutes after Annie’s, and just twenty minutes before herconnecting flight to Bangor.It was winter and snowing in Boston when he landed, at ten at night, whenmost of the air traɽc had ended. He ran through the nearly empty corridors ofLogan Airport to the gate for the Bangor ɻight. There was a stairwell that leddownstairs, and a door that opened to the tarmac. Rathbun rushed outside intothe frigid air. The passengers were still on the ramp; Annie was only six feetaway from him. “Annie!” he cried. She turned around. As soon as she saw who itwas, her shoulders slumped, and she walked toward him.Rathbun talked to Miscavige and said that he would get a couple of hotelrooms in Boston and bring Annie back in the morning, but Miscavige wasunwilling to risk it. He told Rathbun that he had already arranged for JohnTravolta’s jet to pick them up a few hours later.Annie and Jim Logan were ɹnally divorced on August 26, 1993. He never sawher again. (She died in 2011 of lung cancer, at the age of fifty-five.)BY HIS ACTIONS, Miscavige showed his instinctive understanding of how to cater tothe sense of entitlement that comes with great stardom. It was not just a matterof disposing of awkward personal problems, such as clinging spouses; there werealso the endless demands for nourishment of an ego that is always aware of thefragility of success; the longing for privacy that is constantly at war with the"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"demand for recognition; the need to be fortiɹed against ordinariness andfeelings of mortality; and the sense that the quality of the material world thatsurrounds you reɻects upon your own value, and therefore everything must bemade perfect. These were qualities Miscavige demanded for himself as well. Hesurrounded Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman with an approving and completelydeferential environment, as spotless and odorless as a fairy tale. A specialbungalow was prepared for their stay at Gold Base, along with a private rosegarden. When the couple longed to play tennis, a court was rehabilitated, atsigniɹcant expense. Miscavige heard about the couple’s fantasy of runningthrough a ɹeld of wildɻowers together, so he had Sea Org members plant asection of the desert; when that failed to meet his expectations, the meadow wasplowed up and sodded with grass. Miscavige assigned them a personal chef,Sinar Parman, who had cooked for Hubbard, and had a high-end gymconstructed that was mainly for the use of Cruise and himself. When a ɻoodtriggered a mudslide that despoiled the couple’s romantic bungalow, Miscavigeheld the entire base responsible, and ordered everyone to work sixteen-hourdays until everything was restored to its previous pristine condition.In July 1990, Cruise’s involvement with the church became public in anarticle in the tabloid Star. (Cruise himself didn’t admit his aɽliation until twoyears later, in an interview with Barbara Walters.) The fact that the informationwas leaked, probably from a source within the church, was at once a greatembarrassment for Miscavige and a relief, because Cruise’s name was nowɹnally linked irrevocably in the public mind with Scientology. He oʃered anunparalleled conduit to Hollywood celebrity culture, and Miscavige went togreat lengths to court him. At Thanksgiving, 1990, he ordered Parman to cookdinner for Cruise’s whole family. Miscavige even arranged for Cruise to placesome investments with the Feshbach brothers—Kurt, Joseph, and Matthew—three Palo Alto, California, stockbrokers. They were devoted Scientologists whohad made a fortune by selling short on the stock market. According to Rathbun,when Cruise’s investments actually lost money, the Feshbachs obliginglyreplenished the star’s account with their personal funds.Early on, Cruise and Miscavige shared a powerful sense of identity with eachother. They were both short but powerfully built, “East Coast personalities,” asParman diagnosed them. They shared a love of motorcycles, cars, andadventurous sports. Miscavige was bedazzled by the glamour surrounding thestar, who introduced him to a social set outside of Scientology, a worldMiscavige knew little about. He had spent most of his life cloistered in the SeaOrg. He was thrilled when he visited Cruise on the set of Days of Thunder, and"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"the actor took him skydiving for the ɹrst time. Cruise, for his part, fell underthe spell of Miscavige’s commanding personality. He modeled his determinednaval-officer hero in A Few Good Men on Miscavige, a fact that the church leaderliked to brag about.Just before Christmas, 1990, Sinar Parman was told that Tom and Nicole weregoing to get married, and that he and a Sea Org pastry chef, along with theirwives, would be cooking for the wedding party. Parman was assured that theywould get paid for their trouble; in the meantime, they should buy some civilianclothes suitable for a cold climate. Parman went shopping and put everything onhis credit card, along with a Christmas present for Cruise. Then Cruise’s privatejet ɻew them to Telluride, Colorado, where the wedding took place. They spentthree days preparing meals for guests. Cruise’s auditor, Ray Mithoʃ, performedthe ceremony, and David Miscavige served as best man. Afterward, Parman wasinformed that Miscavige had changed his mind about paying for his services andthe expenses incurred. Parman was left with hundreds of dollars charged to hiscredit card, which he struggled to pay oʃ on his Sea Org salary—ɹfty dollars aweek at the time.At ɹrst, Tom and Nicole seemed like the ideal Scientology power match. Theywere intelligent, articulate, extraordinarily attractive people. At Gold Base, Tomreached OT III. He would have spent a considerable amount of time after thatself-auditing in order to exorcise his body thetans. Although Nicole didn’t shareTom’s obvious enthusiasm for Scientology—she was a cooler personality in anycase—she was drawn along by his intensity. She went Clear in no time. Within ayear, she had reached OT II, but then, mysteriously, stopped. A candidate whohas begun the OT levels is not supposed to pause until OT III has been achieved.Miscavige suspected the inɻuence of a Suppressive Person—speciɹcally,Kidman’s father, Antony Kidman, a clinical psychologist who had written severalpopular self-help books in Australia. From the beginning Kidman was privatelyconsidered a Potential Trouble Source.One day at Gold Base, Marty Rathbun summoned a sixteen-year-old Sea Orgmember, Marc Headley, and told him that he had been selected to undergospecial auditing. He was to tell no one about it, including his co-workers and hisfamily. And by the way, the auditor would be Tom Cruise.Headley reported to a large conference room. Right away he noticed NicoleKidman, who was also receiving auditing, and Kirstie Alley, who he later cameto believe was there mainly as a “celebrity prop,” since she did little other thanread.“Hello, I am Tom,” Headley remembers Cruise saying, vigorously shaking his"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"hand.4 He handed Headley the metal cans that were attached to the E-Meter andasked if the temperature in the room was all right. Then he instructed Headleyto take a deep breath and let it out. This was a metabolism test, which issupposed to show whether the preclear was prepared for the session.Apparently, the needle on the E-Meter didn’t fall suɽciently. Headley was sostarstruck that he was having trouble focusing.“Did you get enough sleep?” Cruise asked.“Yeah.”“Did you get enough to eat?”“Yeah.”“Did you take your vitamins?”Headley said he never took vitamins.“That might be the problem,” Cruise said. He went into the pantry, which wasɹlled with snacks for the celebrities. Headley was used to the meager Sea Orgfare, and he was taken aback by the cornucopia laid out for the stars to nibbleon. As Cruise rummaged through the cabinets, Headley bit into a cheese Danish.The actor found several vitamins and then asked, “Do you take a lot of beepollen?”Headley had no idea what he meant.“Never had bee pollen?” Cruise said excitedly. “Oh, that will do the trick forsure.”He led Headley to his Yamaha motorcycle and rode the two of them to thebase canteen. It was dinnertime, and the canteen was ɹlled with Headley’sgawking co-workers. Headley was surprised to learn that there was bee pollenfor sale, although he says Cruise didn’t pay for it; he just grabbed it and theywent back to the conference room. This time, Headley passed the metabolismtest, although he privately credited the Danish over the bee pollen.According to Headley, Cruise helped him through the Upper IndoctrinationTraining Routines. “Look at the wall,” Cruise would have said, according toHubbard’s speciɹcations. “Thank you. Walk over to the wall. Thank you. Touchthe wall. Thank you.” The purpose of this exercise, according to Hubbard, is to“assert control over the preclear and increase the preclear’s havingness.” Cruisewent on to ask Headley to make an object, such as a desk, hold still, or becomemore solid. Another exercise involved telling an ashtray to stand up, at whichpoint the preclear stands and lifts the ashtray, thanks the ashtray, and thencommands the ashtray to sit down. With each repetition, the preclear’scommands get louder, so soon he is yelling at the ashtray at the top of his voice.The purpose of this drill is to come to the realization that your intention is"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"separate from your words and the sound waves that carry them. Theseprocedures went on for hours, as Headley robotically responded to Cruise’scommands. “You learn that if you don’t do what they say, they’ll just ask thesame questions ɹve million times,” Headley recalled. At one point, he fellasleep, but he kept responding automatically. This training went on for hoursevery day for several weeks, until Tom and Nicole returned to Hollywood.When Nicole moved into Tom’s mansion in Paciɹc Palisades, they were underconstant watch. Miscavige’s wife, Shelly, interviewed Scientology candidates forTom and Nicole’s household staʃ. According to former executives, theScientologists who worked for Cruise and Kidman reported to the church aboutwhatever they observed. Miscavige oʃered the couple signiɹcant gifts of servicefrom Sea Org members. They installed a sophisticated audiovisual system. SinarParman, the chef, says he helped design the kitchen. There was a comfortable,symbiotic relationship between the star and the church. The use of unpaidchurch clergy to help him renovate his house, hire his staʃ, and installsophisticated technology was simply a part of the deal.5PAUL HAGGIS WAS ALWAYS a workaholic, and as his career took oʃ, he spent evenless time with his family. He wouldn’t get home till late at night or early in themorning. His three daughters scarcely knew who he was.In general, Haggis was far more interested in causes than people. He drove anenvironmentally friendly car—a little yellow Mini Cooper with a WAR IS NOT THEANSWER bumper sticker. The Haggis house became a regular stop for the social-justice sector of the Hollywood left. Once when Haggis threw a fund-raiser forTibet, the Dalai Lama came. The backyard was strewn with celebrities andchanting monks. The girls thought it was hysterical. Barbra Streisand introducedherself to the Dalai Lama, and he asked what she did. “A little singing, a littledancing,” she told him.For years, Paul and Diane’s marriage had been in turmoil, and in 1983 theybegan an epic and bitter divorce. The proceedings lasted for nine years. The girlslived with Diane, visiting Paul every other weekend. During this period ofestrangement from his wife, Haggis ɻew to New York with a casting director,who was also a Scientologist. They shared a kiss. He later confessed the incidentduring an auditing session and was sent to the Ethics Oɽce, where he wasassigned some minor punishment. He had been to Ethics before, usually formissing coursework, but he was beginning to feel that the more famous hebecame, the less likely he was to be rebuked for behavior that was considered"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"“out ethics” for other members.Anytime Haggis boggled at an illogical or fanciful piece of data, he wasinvariably reminded that it was his failure entirely. He had come intoScientology as an adult, so his experience outside the church still informed hisjudgments. When he stumbled on something in Scientology that he thought wasridiculous, he would make a mental detour around it, not wanting to spend thetime and money to do the “repairs” that his supervisors would prescribe.Although he never lost his skepticism, his daughters were born into the religion.They were schooled in it from the beginning. Nearly everyone they knew was aScientologist.Each of the girls was a near clone of one of the parents. Alissa and Katy werePaul, pale and blond, but more sharp-featured, with dimpled noses and sculptedcheekbones. Lauren, the middle daughter, was Diane, inheriting her half-Greekmother’s olive skin and dark, Mediterranean eyes. The girls were bright,inquisitive, and cheerful by nature, but their parents’ divorce was an endless,churning, distracting, heartbreaking trauma, and it took a toll.The girls went to Delphi Academy, a private school that uses Hubbard “studytech.” It is largely self-guided. According to Scientology pedagogy, there arethree barriers that retard a student’s progress. The ɹrst is “Lack of Mass.” Thisprinciple was derived from Alfred Korzybski’s observation that the word and theobject that it names are not the same thing. If the student is studying tractors,for instance, it is best to have a real tractor in front of him. The absence of theactual object is disorienting to the student. “It makes him feel physiologicallycondensed,” Hubbard writes. “Actually makes him feel squashed. Makes himfeel bent, sort of spinny, sort of dead, bored, exasperated.” Photographs of theobject can help, or motion pictures, as they are “a sort of promise of hope of themass,” but they are not an adequate substitute for the tractor under study. Theresult for the student is that he becomes dizzy, he’ll have headaches, his stomachgets upset, his eyes will hurt, and “he’s going to wind up with a face that feelssquashed.” Illness and even suicide may be the expected result. Hubbard’s studytech remedies the problem by using clay or Play-Doh for the student to makereplicas of the object.The second principle is “Too Steep a Gradient,” which Hubbard describes asthe diɽculty a student encounters when he makes a leap he’s not prepared for.“It is a sort of a confusion or a reelingness that goes with this one,” Hubbardwrites. His solution is to go back to the point where the student fullyunderstands the subject, then break the material into bite-size pieces.The “Undefined Word”—the third and most important principle—occurs when"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"the student tries to absorb material while bypassing the deɹnition of the wordsemployed. “THE ONLY REASON A PERSON GIVES UP A STUDY OR BECOMESCONFUSED OR UNABLE TO LEARN IS BECAUSE HE HAS GONE PAST A WORDTHAT WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD,” Hubbard emphasizes in one of his chidingtechnical bulletins. “WORDS SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFERENT OR MORE THANONE MEANING.” A misunderstood word “gives one a distinctly blank feeling ora washed out feeling,” Hubbard writes. “A not-there feeling and a sort of anhysteria will follow in the back of that.” The solution is to have a largedictionary at hand, preferably one with lots of pictures in it. All Scientologytexts contain glossaries for specialized Scientology terms. The need tounderstand the meaning of words, Hubbard writes, “is a sweepingly fantasticdiscovery in the field of education and don’t neglect it.”These last two principles are fundamental to the induction of Scientologyitself. Because the church asserts that everything Hubbard wrote or spoke isinarguably true, whatever you don’t understand or accept is your fault. Thesolution is to go back and study the words and approach the material in a moredeliberate fashion. Eventually, you’ll get it. Then you can move on.Lauren loved her teacher at Delphi, but the Hubbard method placed theresponsibility of learning almost entirely on the student. For Lauren, herparents’ tumultuous divorce was a crushing distraction. It seemed to her that noone was paying attention to her, either at home or at school. She was illiterateuntil she was eleven. She couldn’t read or write her own name.Second-generation Scientologists are typically far more at home with thelanguage and culture of the church than their parents are. And yet they may ɹndthemselves a little lost when trying to deal with an uncomprehending society.The ɹrst time Alissa noticed that she was doing something diʃerent from mostpeople was when she performed a Contact Assist. Scientology preaches that ifyou repeatedly touch a fresh wound to the object that caused the injury andsilently concentrate, the pain lessens and the sense of trauma fades. If aScientologist sees a person close his hand in a door, for instance, a churchmanual instructs the Scientologist to “have him go back and, with his injuredhand, touch the exact spot on the same door, duplicating the same motions thatoccurred at the time of the injury.” There are other kinds of assists that willawaken an unconscious person, eliminate boils, reduce earaches and back pain,and make a drunk sober. Instead of crying when she hurt herself, Alissa wouldquietly redo the action over and over, until she had drained it of its sting. Shenoticed that non-Scientologists had no idea what she was doing. She was alsosurprised when she went to a friend’s house for dinner and the family said grace"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"before the meal. It took her a second to realize what they were doing. In heropinion, God plays a negligible role in Scientology. “I mean, there’s a spot for it,but it’s sort of a blank spot.” So whenever her friends began to pray, “I wouldbow my head and let them have their ceremony.”Paul was also scarred by the divorce—although, as would often be the casefor him, he would mine the experience for his work. He created a televisionseries, Family Law, that was based to some extent on his divorce from Diane. Healways found more solace and meaning in his work than he did in his family.Each year he grew more successful, but the gap between him and his daughtersgrew wider. They knew him better as a writer than as a father, and they wouldpuzzle over the fact that he was so cool to them, when his scripts were often fullof emotion. Paul felt guilty about not spending time with the girls, so he wouldarrange to bring them to the set and assign them some small task. Alissa got todo nearly every job in the industry, from wardrobe to production assistant; shereceived a Directors Guild card in Canada by the time she was fifteen.In 1991, Haggis went to a Fourth of July party at the home of someScientologist friends. He met a striking actress there named Deborah Rennard.She had grown up in Scientology. In her early twenties she had studied acting atthe Beverly Hills Playhouse and had fallen under the inɻuence of MiltonKatselas, the legendary acting teacher and Hubbard’s former collaborator. Theybecame lovers. Milton was spellbinding, but he was twenty-seven years olderthan Deborah, and their relationship was an exhausting roller-coaster ride. Theystayed together for six years. When Paul met her, Deborah and Milton hadrecently broken up. She was a successful actress with a recurring role in thelong-running television series Dallas—as J. R. Ewing’s loyal but alwaysunattainable secretary."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Deborah Rennard and Milton Katselas in Silverlake, California, 1985Paul was still going through his epic divorce. Early in his relationship withDeborah, Paul admitted that he was having a spiritual crisis. He said he’d racedup to the top of the Bridge on faith, but he hadn’t gotten what he expected. “Idon’t believe I’m a spiritual being. I actually am what you see,” Paul told her.Deborah advised him to get more auditing. Personally, she was havingbreakthroughs that led her to discover past lives. Images ɻoated through hermind, and she realized, “That’s not here. I’m not in my body, I’m in anotherplace.” She might be confronting what the church calls a “contra-survivalaction”—“like the time I clobbered Paul or threw something at him.” She wouldlook for an “earlier similar” in her life. Suddenly she would see herself inEngland in the nineteenth century. “It was a ɻeeting glimpse at what I wasdoing then. Clobbering husbands.” When she examined these kindred momentsin her current existence and past ones, the emotional charge would dissipate.Paul would say, “Don’t you think you’re making this up?” At ɹrst, she thoughthe might be right. But then she wondered if that really mattered. She felt shewas getting better, so who cared whether they were memories or fantasies? Asan actor she went through an analogous process when working on a scene; shewould grab hold of a feeling from who knows where. It felt real. It helped herget into the role. As long as the process worked, why quibble?Deborah made sure Paul showed up at the annual gala and became involved inScientology charitable organizations. Over the years, Haggis spent about"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"$100,000 on courses and auditing and an equal amount on various Scientologyinitiatives. This ɹgure doesn’t include the money that Diane gave to the churchwhile she was married to Paul. Haggis also gave $250,000 to the InternationalAssociation of Scientologists, a fund set up to protect and promote the church.Deborah spent about $150,000 on coursework of her own. Paul and Deborahheld a fund-raiser in their home that raised $200,000 for a new Scientologybuilding in Nashville, and they contributed an additional $10,000 from theirown pocket. The demands for money—“regging,” it’s called in Scientology,because the calls come from the Registrar’s Oɽce—never stopped. Paul gavethem money just to keep them from calling.1 A lawyer for Preston and Travolta claims that the couple “never put their son through a ‘PuriɹcationRundown’ treatment and would never have engaged in any type of conduct that would have endangeredtheir son’s health, welfare, or well-being in any way.” He maintains that Preston was referring to herselfwhen she responded to Williams’s question.2 According to the church, “The Sea Org policy on children changed in 1986. The Executive DirectorInternational, Mr. Guillaume Lesevre, issued the change in policy which provided that Sea Org memberscould no longer have children and remain in the Sea Org.”3 The church denies that there is such a thing as the blow drill. The church produced an aɽdavit byMorehead, executed Mar. 31, 1997, in which he says: “I have seen people leave and they were free to do so. Iam now doing so myself.... I am aware of stories of individuals claiming to have been held against theirwill, but I know for myself and from my security position that the stories are completely false.” Moreheadrepudiates the statement, saying, “In March of 1997 at that specific moment I would have signed anything.”4 Cruise, through his attorney, says he has no recollection of meeting Marc Headley. Bruce Hines, who wasthere to make sure the process was done correctly, witnessed the sessions and clearly remembers Cruiseauditing Headley.5 Cruise’s attorney remarks, “So far as I know, Mr. Cruise has always paid for any services he received.”"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"N7The Future Is Oursow that he was ɹrmly in control of the church, Miscavige sought torestore the image of Scientology. The 1980s had been a devastatingperiod for the church’s reputation, with Hubbard’s disappearance andeventual death, the high-proɹle lawsuits, and the avalanche of embarrassingpublicity. Miscavige hired Hill & Knowlton, the oldest and largest publicrelations ɹrm in the world, to oversee a national campaign. The legendarilyslick worldwide chairman of Hill & Knowlton, Robert Keith Gray, specialized inrehabilitating disgraced dictators, arms dealers, and governments with appallinghuman-rights records. As representatives of the government of Kuwait, Hill &Knowlton had been partly responsible for selling the Persian Gulf War to theAmerican people. One of the company’s tactics was to provide the testimony ofa ɹfteen-year-old girl, “Nayirah,” to a human-rights committee in the US Houseof Representatives in October 1990. Nayirah described herself as an ordinaryKuwaiti who had volunteered in a hospital. She tearfully told the Housemembers of watching Iraqi soldiers storm into the prenatal unit. “They took thebabies out of the incubators, took the incubators, and left the babies on the coldɻoor to die,” she said. The incident could never be conɹrmed, and the girlturned out to be the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United Statesand had never volunteered at the hospital. The propaganda operation was, at thetime, the most expensive and sophisticated public relations campaign ever run inthe United States by a foreign government.Gray had also worked closely with the Reagan campaign. He regaled theScientologists with his ability to take a “mindless actor” and turn him into the“Teɻon President.” Hill & Knowlton went to work for the church, putting outphony news stories, often in the form of video news releases made to look likeactual reports rather than advertisements. The church began supporting high-proɹle causes, such as Ted Turner’s Goodwill Games, thereby associating itselfwith other well-known corporate sponsors, such as Sony and Pepsi. There werefull-page ads in newsmagazines touting the church’s philosophy, and cabletelevision ads promoting Scientology books and Dianetics seminars.Then, in May 1991, came one of the greatest public relations catastrophes in"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"the church’s history. Time magazine published a scathing cover story titled“Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power,” by investigative reporterRichard Behar. The exposé revealed that just one of the religion’s many entities,the Church of Spiritual Technology, had taken in half a billion dollars in 1987alone. Hundreds of millions of dollars from the parent organization were buriedin secret accounts in Lichtenstein, Switzerland, and Cyprus. Many of thepersonalities linked with the church were savaged in the article. Hubbardhimself was described as “part storyteller, part ɻimɻam man.” The Feshbachbrothers were the “terrors of the stock exchanges,” who spread false informationabout companies in order to drive down their valuations. Behar quoted a formerchurch executive as saying that John Travolta stayed in the church only becausehe was worried that details of his sex life would be made public if he left. Thearticle asserted that Miscavige made frequent jokes about Travolta’s “allegedlypromiscuous homosexual behavior.” When Behar queried Travolta’s attorney forthe star’s comment, he was told that such questions were “bizarre.” “Two weekslater, Travolta announced that he was getting married to actress Kelly Preston, afellow Scientologist,” Behar wrote.“Those who criticize the church—journalists, doctors, lawyers, and evenjudges—often ɹnd themselves engulfed in litigation, stalked by private eyes,framed for ɹctional crimes, beaten up, or threatened by death,” Behar noted. Heaccused the Justice Department of failing to back the IRS and the FBI in bringinga racketeering suit against the church because it was unwilling to spend themoney required to take the organization on. He quoted Cynthia Kisser, head ofthe Cult Awareness Network in Chicago: “Scientology is quite likely the mostruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious and the most lucrativecult the country has ever seen.”After the Time article appeared, Miscavige was invited to appear on ABC’sNightline, a highly prestigious news show, to defend the image of the church. Hehad never been interviewed in his life. He rehearsed for months, as much asfour hours per day, with Rathbun and Rinder. He would prod them to ask himquestions, then complain that they didn’t sound like Ted Koppel, the show’scourtly but incisive host. Miscavige would ask himself the questions in what hethought was Koppel’s voice, then respond with a hypothetical answer. He sortedthrough what seemed to his aides an endless number of wardrobe choices beforesettling on a blue suit with a purple tie and a handkerchief in his breast pocket.Finally, on Valentine’s Day, 1992, he went to New York, where the show wouldbe broadcast live.The interview was preceded by a ɹfteen-minute report by Forrest Sawyer"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"about Scientology’s claims and controversies. “The church says it now hascenters in over seventy countries, with more on the way,” Sawyer said. HeberJentzsch, the president of the Church of Scientology International, was featured,claiming a membership of eight million people. Sawyer also intervieweddefectors, who talked about their families being ripped apart, or being bilked oftens of thousands of dollars. Richard Behar, the Time reporter, recounted howScientology’s private investigators had obtained his phone records. VickiAznaran, a former high oɽcial in the church, who was then suing the church,told Sawyer that Miscavige ordered attacks on those he consideredtroublemakers—“have them, their homes, broken into, have them beaten, havethings stolen from them, slash their tires, break their car windows, whatever.”Koppel allowed Miscavige to respond to the Sawyer report. “Every singledetractor on there is a part of a religious hate group called Cult AwarenessNetwork and their sister group called American Family Foundation,” Miscavigesaid. “It’s the same as the KKK would be with blacks.” He seemed completely atease.“You realize there’s a little bit of a problem getting people to talk criticallyabout Scientology because, quite frankly, they’re scared,” Koppel observed.“Oh, no, no, no, no.”“I’m telling you, people are scared,” Koppel insisted.“Let’s not give the American public the wrong impression,” said Miscavige.“The person getting harassed is myself and the church.”Koppel then lobbed what seemed like an easy question for a man who hadspent so much time preparing for this encounter. “See if you can explain to mewhy I would want to be a Scientologist.”“Because you care about yourself and life itself,” Miscavige said eagerly. Hegave the example of communication skills. “This is something that majorbreakthroughs exist in Scientology, being able to communicate in the worldaround you,” he said. “There’s an actual formula for communication which canbe understood. You can drill on this formula.”“So far in life, I haven’t had a whole lot of trouble communicating,” Koppeldrolly noted.“What in your life do you feel is not right, that you would like to help?”Miscavige asked. It was a classic Scientology technique, to ɹnd a subject’s“ruin,” the thing that was blocking his access to happiness.“I feel perfectly comfortable with my life,” Koppel replied.Miscavige switched tactics. “Let’s look at it this way, then, what Scientologydoes. If you look out across the world today, you could say that if you take a"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"person who’s healthy, doing well, like yourself, you’d say that person is normal,not a crazy, not somebody who is psychotic, you look at a wall and they call itan elephant,” he said, extemporizing. “And you can see people below that—crazy people, criminals—that I think society in general will look at and say,‘That breed of person hasn’t something quite right because they’re not up to thislevel of personality.’...What we are trying to do in Scientology is take somebodyfrom this higher level and move them up to greater ability.”“What about the folks ‘down there’?”“We don’t ignore them. My point is this: Scientology is there to make the ablemore able.”“Another way of saying that is: you’re interested in folks who’ve got money.”Miscavige objected, claiming that the money in the church goes to goodcauses. “We are the largest social reform group in the world,” he said, addingthat if a person stays in Scientology long enough, he’ll have plenty of money.Then he referenced Sawyer’s report again. “The one girl there that wascomplaining about it, a girl named Vicki Aznaran, which by the way, this is agirl who was kicked out for trying to bring criminals into the church, somethingshe didn’t mention.”“You say a ‘girl.’ I think we’re talking about a grown woman, right?”“A grown woman, excuse me,” Miscavige said. “She violated the mores andcodes of the group.”“Either you have made an accurate charge against someone or—what anumber of ... the pieces written about Scientology suggest is that when you havea critic before you, you destroy those people.”“That’s easy to say—”“You smear them.”“That’s easy for the person to say, but she’s the one on that program smearingme.”As for Richard Behar, the Time reporter, Miscavige remarked, “The man wason record on two occasions attempting to get Scientologists kidnapped. That isan illegal act.”The hour had ended, but Miscavige had just made another unsupportedallegation. Koppel decided to extend the show “a few minutes,” but it went onanother half hour without any commercial breaks. He asked Miscavige toexplain what he meant about Behar. “Some people had called him up and he wastelling them to kidnap Scientologists out,” Miscavige said.“Now, kidnapping, as you well know, is a federal crime,” Koppel observed.“So, why didn’t you bring charges against him?”"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"“He didn’t succeed,” Miscavige said. “Ted, Ted, you’re missing the point.”“There is such a thing as attempted rape, attempted murder, attemptedkidnapping. It’s also a crime.”“I think you’re really missing the issue, Ted, because my point is this: Thatman represents himself as an objective reporter. Here he is on record a fullthree years before he wrote this article, stating that he felt Scientologists shouldbe kidnapped to change their religion.“Second of all,” Miscavige continued, “let’s look at this article, and let’s notfool ourselves. It wasn’t an objective piece. It was done at the behest of EliLilly,” the pharmaceutical manufacturer. “They were upset because of thedamage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac.”“I’m sure you have evidence of that,” Koppel said. “You have affidavits?”“Let me tell you what else I have—”“You have affidavits?”“From them? Of course not. You think they’d admit it?” Miscavige said. “Weput in a call to Eli Lilly. Their response was, ‘We can neither conɹrm nordeny.’ ”1In Sawyer’s report there was a brief clip of Hubbard telling his followers, “Iwas up in the Van Allen Belt. This is factual. And I don’t know why they’rescared of the Van Allen Belt, because it’s simply hot. You’d be surprised howwarm space is.” Koppel observed, “When I hear about a man talking abouthaving been taken out to the Van Allen space radiation belt or space ships thatwere essentially the same thing as the DC-8, I’ve got to tell you, I mean, if we’retalking about this man’s credibility, that certainly raises some questions in mymind.”Miscavige said that Hubbard’s quote had been taken out of context.“Take a minute, if you would, and see if you can put it into context for us sothat it does not sound ridiculous,” Koppel said.“Okay,” said Miscavige. “I want you to take the Catholic Church and takeright now and explain to me, to make sense that the Virgin Mary was a virgin,scientiɹcally impossible, unless we’re talking about something ...” He trailedoʃ, then said, “Okay, I’ll be like you, I’ll be the cynic. If we’re talking aboutartiɹcial insemination, how could that be? If you’re talking about going toHeaven, except we have a space shuttle going out there, we have the Apollogoing out there, you do that. I’m not here—” He was obviously confused anduncomfortable.“You were a Catholic as a child, right?” Koppel asked helpfully.“Yeah.”"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"“So you know full well that those issues are questions of faith.”Miscavige wouldn’t accept the life raft that Koppel oʃered him. Scientology issold as an entirely rational approach to understanding and mastering existence.“No, no,” Miscavige replied. “Talk about the Van Allen Belt or whatever, thatforms no part of current Scientology, none whatsoever.”“But what did he mean when he was talking about it?”“Quite frankly, this tape here, he’s talking about the origins of the universe,and I think you’re going to ɹnd that in any, any, any religion, and I think youcan make the same mockery of it. I think it’s offensive.”“I’m not mocking it, I’m asking you a question,” Koppel replied. “You turn itaround and ask me about Catholicism. I say we’re talking about areas of faith.”“Well, it’s not even a matter of faith,” Miscavige insisted, “becauseScientology is about you, yourself, and what you do. You’re bringing upsomething that isn’t part of current Scientology, that isn’t something thatScientologists study, that is part of some tape taken from, I have no idea, andasking me about it and asking me to put it in context, that I can’t do.” Later,Miscavige told Koppel that he had never heard the Hubbard tape before. (It wasa part of a lecture Hubbard gave in 1963, in which he talked about the between-lives period, when thetans are transported to Venus to have their memorieserased.)After the show, Miscavige returned to the greenroom, where Rinder, Rathbun,and Norman Starkey, another executive, were waiting. “How’d I do?” he asked.“Gee, sir, you kicked ass,” one of the men said.“It was a home run,” Rathbun assured him.“Really?” Miscavige asked doubtfully. “Jesus Christ, I was just there and Idon’t know. The guy was pissing me off so much.”Koppel won an Emmy for that show. Miscavige took credit for it, saying, “Igot Ted the Emmy.” He even had a replica of an Emmy made and placed in theOfficers Lounge at Gold Base. But he never went on television again.THE TIME STORY WAS a turning point in the church’s history. The embarrassment forScientology celebrities undercut the church’s strategy of making the religionappear to be a spiritual refuge for the show-business elite. One of the chiefappeals of the religion to prospective recruits was the perceived network thatScientology provided its members, especially in Hollywood, awarding them anadvantage in a ruthlessly competitive industry. With the Time article, aɽliationwith the church became an embarrassing liability."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Tom Cruise was one of the stars who appeared to be backing away fromScientology.2 He stopped moving up the Bridge. He and Nicole adopted twochildren, Isabella and Connor, and began spending more time in Sydney,Kidman’s hometown, where she could be close to her family. He hired apowerful publicist, Pat Kingsley, who was able to enforce rigid control over thecontent of the interviews the star granted. Although his aɽliation withScientology was generally known, there was no more fuel for the media mill. Heseemed to be putting as much distance between himself and the church aspossible.The church began to plot its counterattack. The Cult Awareness Network,besieged by more than ɹfty lawsuits brought by Scientologists, went bankrupt in1996. An individual Scientologist purchased its name and assets at auction. Soonafter that, the reorganized Cult Awareness Network sent out a brochure laudingthe Church of Scientology for its eʃorts to “increase happiness and improveconditions for oneself and others.” The church also began a $3 million campaignagainst Time, placing full-page ads every day in USA Today for twelve weeks,charging that the magazine had “supported” Adolf Hitler, for instance, bynaming him the 1938 “Man of the Year” because of his dominance in Europeanaʃairs. A lengthy supplement was placed in USA Today titled “The Story ThatTime Couldn’t Tell: Who Really Controls the News at Time—and Why,” in whichthe church claimed that Time was actually under the sway of the pharmaceuticalindustry—speciɹcally, Eli Lilly and Company, the maker of Prozac. The churchhad charged that Prozac caused people to commit mass murder and suicide. TheTime article was the drug company’s revenge, the church alleged.3Rathbun directed the ferocious legal assault on Time and oversaw the team ofprivate detectives probing into Behar’s private life. The church, employing whatwas reported to be an annual litigation budget of $20 million and a team ofmore than a hundred lawyers to handle the suits already in the courts, ɹled a$416 million libel action against Time Warner, the parent company of themagazine, and Behar. Because the church is regarded under American law as a“public ɹgure,” Scientology’s lawyers had to prove not only that the magazine’sallegations were wrong but also that Behar acted with “actual malice”—a legalterm meaning that he knowingly published information he knew to be false, orthat he recklessly disregarded the facts, because he intended to damage thechurch. Although there was no convincing evidence proving that the facts werewrong or that the reporter was biased, the case went all the way to the USSupreme Court, which sustained the district court’s initial ruling against thechurch. In the process, it cost Time more money in defense costs than any other"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"case in its history.Rathbun’s strategy followed Hubbard’s dictate that the purpose of a lawsuit is“to harass and discourage rather than win.” Hubbard also wrote: “If attacked onsome vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization, always ɹndor manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace....Don’t ever defend. Always attack.” He added: “NEVER agree to an investigationof Scientology. ONLY agree to an investigation of the attackers.” He advisedScientologists: “Start feeding lurid, blood, sex, crime, actual evidence on theattackers to the press.... Make it rough, rough on attackers all the way.... Therehas never yet been an attacker who was not reeking with crime. All we had todo was look for it and murder would come out.” These were maxims thatRathbun took as his guidelines.The Time article capsized Miscavige’s attempts to break free of the negativeassociations so many people had with Scientology. But there was an even largerbattle under way, one in which the church’s very existence was at stake: its ɹghtwith the IRS to regain its tax-exempt status as a bona ɹde religion, which it hadlost in 1967.The government’s stance was that the Church of Scientology was in fact acommercial enterprise, with “virtually incomprehensible ɹnancial procedures”and a “scripturally based hostility to taxation.” The IRS had ruled that thechurch was largely operated to beneɹt its founder. Miscavige inherited some ofthat liability when he took over after Hubbard’s death. A tax exemption wouldnot only put the imprimatur of the American government on the church as acertiɹed religion, rather than a corrupt, proɹt-making concern, but it would alsoprovide a substantial amount of immunity from civil suits and the persistentfederal criminal investigations. A decision against the tax exemption, on theother hand, would destroy the entire enterprise, because Hubbard had decidedin 1973 that the church should not pay its back taxes. Twenty years later, thechurch was $1 billion in arrears, with only $125 million in reserves. The founderhad placed Scientology’s head on the executioner’s block.The war between the church and the IRS had already gone on for more thantwo decades, with both sides waging a campaign of intimidation and espionage.Miscavige accused the Criminal Investigation Division of the IRS of engaging insurveillance of church leaders, wiretaps, and illegal opening of the church’s mail.Now the church upped the ante by besieging the IRS with 200 lawsuits on thepart of the church and more than 2,300 suits on behalf of individual parishionersin every jurisdiction in the country, overwhelming government lawyers, runningup fantastic expenses, and causing an immense amount of havoc inside the IRS."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Miscavige boasted that the entire legal budget of the federal agency wasexhausted: “They didn’t even have money to attend the annual American BarAssociation conference of lawyers—which they were supposed to speak at!” Thechurch ran ads against the agency, using the images of beloved celebrities (whowere not Scientologists) such as John Wayne and Willie Nelson, who had beenaudited by the IRS. “All of America Loved Lucy,” one ad said, over an iconicphoto of Lucille Ball, “except the IRS.” A ten-thousand-dollar reward was offeredto potential whistle-blowers to expose IRS abuses. Private investigators dug intothe private lives of IRS oɽcials, going so far as to attend seminars and pose asIRS workers, to see who had a drinking problem or might be cheating on aspouse. Stories based on these investigations were promoted by a phony newsbureau the church established, and also published in the church’s Freedommagazine, which Scientologists passed out for free on the steps of the IRSheadquarters in Washington. The hatred on both sides for the other was intense.It seemed bizarre that a rather small organization could overmatch the USgovernment, but the harassment campaign was having an eʃect. Somegovernment workers were getting anonymous calls in the middle of the night, orɹnding that their pets had disappeared. Whether or not these events were partof the Scientology onslaught, they added to the paranoia many in the agencywere feeling.Both the church and the IRS faced the challenge of addressing the question ofwhat, exactly, constituted a religion in the eyes of the American government. Onthe church’s side was a body of scholars who had arisen in defense of what werecalled “new religious movements,” such as the Hare Krishnas, the UnificationChurch, and of course the Church of Scientology. The term was employed toreplace the word “cult,” because these academics found no reliable way ofdistinguishing a cult from a religion. They believe that new religious movementsare persecuted and ridiculed simply because they are recent and seem exotic.Often, such experts are paid to testify in court on behalf of these organizations.In the courtroom setting, the casual distinctions that many people often makeabout cults and brainwashing have proven to be diɽcult to sustain, as theexperts pose telling comparisons with the history of mainstream religions,whose practices and rituals have long since been folded into a broad culturalacceptance.The Church of Scientology had decided to enlist such experts following the FBIraids in 1977, which exposed Operation Snow White and created a major crisisin the church. There was a deliberate campaign to provide religious cloaking forthe church’s activities. A Scientology cross was created. Scientology ministers"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"now appeared wearing Roman collars. And religious scholars were courted; theywere given tours and allowed to interview carefully coached church members.Frank K. Flinn, a former Franciscan friar and a graduate of Harvard DivinitySchool, has testiɹed repeatedly on behalf of Scientology—notably, in 1984,when the Church of Scientology, along with Mary Sue Hubbard, sued GeraldArmstrong, the former archivist for the church. Flinn deɹned religion as asystem of beliefs of a spiritual nature. There must be norms for behavior—positive commands and negative prohibitions or taboos—as well as rites andceremonies, such as initiations, sacraments, prayers, and services for weddingsand funerals. By these means, the believers are united into an identiɹablecommunity that seeks to live in harmony with what they perceive as theultimate meaning of life. Flinn argued that Scientology amply fulɹlled theserequirements, even if it diʃered in its expression of them from traditionaldenominations.Like Catholicism, Flinn explained, Scientology is a hierarchical religion. Hecompared L. Ron Hubbard to the founders of Catholic religious orders, includinghis own, started by Saint Francis of Assisi, whose followers adopted a vow ofpoverty. Financial disparities within a church are not unusual. Within thehierarchy of Catholicism, for instance, bishops often enjoy a mansion,limousines, servants, and housekeepers; the papacy itself maintains thousands ofpeople on its staʃ, including the Swiss Guards who protect the pope, and anentire order of nuns dedicated to being housekeepers for the papal apartments.The Catholic Church also maintains houses of rehabilitation (like the RPF) forerrant priests hoping to reform themselves. Flinn saw the RPF as being entirelyvoluntary and even tame compared to what he experienced as a friar in theFranciscan Order. He willingly submitted to the religious practice of ɻagellationon Fridays, whipping his legs and back in emulation of the suʃering of Jesusbefore his cruciɹxion. Flinn also spent several hours a day doing manual labor.As a member of a mendicant order, he owned no material possessions at all, noteven the robe he wore. Low wages and humble work were essential to hisspiritual commitment.There is a place for a Supreme Being in Scientology—in Hubbard’s EightDynamics, it’s at the top—but the God idea plays a diminished role compared tomany religions. On the other hand, some religions worship objects—stones oricons or mandalas—rather than a deity. Scientologists don’t pray; but then,neither do Buddhists. The idea of salvation, so central to Christianity, is not sodiʃerent from Hubbard’s assertion that the fundamental law of the universe isthe urge to survive. Flinn compared the Scientology distinction between preclear"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"and Clear to Buddhist notions of entanglement and enlightenment, or Christiandoctrines of sin and grace. The Scientology creed that humans are “thetans”simply means we are beings with immortal souls, which no Christian wouldargue with.One of Flinn’s most interesting and contested points had to do withhagiography, by which he meant attributing extraordinary powers—such asclairvoyance, visions of God or angels, or the ability to perform miracles—to thecharismatic founders of a religion. He pointed to the virgin birth of Jesus, theability of the Buddha to “transmigrate” his soul into the heavens, or Mosesbringing manna to the people of Israel. Such legends are useful in that theybolster the faith of a community, Flinn said. The glaring discrepancies inHubbard’s biography should be seen in the light of the fact that any religiontends to make its founder into something more than human.Flinn was asked to testify about a policy Hubbard had written in 1965 titled“Fair Game Law,” in which he laid down the rules for dealing with SuppressivePersons. That category includes non-Scientologists who are hostile to the church,apostates, and defectors, as well as their spouses, family members, and closefriends. “A truly Suppressive Person or Group has no rights of any kind,”Hubbard wrote. Such enemies, he said, may be “tricked, lied to or destroyed.”In 1965, he wrote another policy letter ambiguously stating, “The practice ofdeclaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on anyEthics Order. It causes bad public relations. [The new ruling] does not cancelany policy on the treatment or handling of an SP.” The supposed revocation ofFair Game took place before Operation Snow White, the harassment of PauletteCooper and other journalists, the persecution of defectors, and many otheractions undertaken by church insiders that were done in the spirit, if not thename, of the original policy.“Almost all religious movements in their very early phase tend to be harsh,”Flinn reminded the court. He contended that they tend to evolve and becomemore lenient over time. As for disconnection, he declared that it was“functionally equivalent to other types of religious exclusions,” such as shunningof nonbelievers among Mennonites and the Amish. In the Book of Leviticus, forinstance, which is part of the Torah and the Old Testament of the ChristianBible, idolaters and those who have strayed from the faith were to be stoned todeath. That practice has disappeared; instead, Orthodox Jews will sit Shiva forthe nonbeliever, treating him as if he is already dead. “So this kind ofphenomenon is not peculiar to Scientology,” Flinn concluded. The implicationunderlying Flinn’s testimony was that Scientology is a new religion that is"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"reinventing old religious norms; whatever abuses it may be committing areerrors of youthful exuberance, and in any case they are pale imitators of thepractices once employed by the mainstream religions that judges and jurorswere likely to be members of.In the 1990s, Flinn had interviewed several Scientologists who were doingRPF in Los Angeles. Their quarters didn’t look any worse than his cell in themonastery, where he slept on a straw bed on a board. He asked if they werefree to go. They told him they were, but they wanted to stay and do penance.Flinn admits to having been a cutup when he was in the order, and he felt outof place. “I was an Irishman in a sea of Germans.” He would be sent out to digthe potato ɹeld as punishment for his misbehavior. However, when he ɹnallydecided to leave his order, instead of being incarcerated or given a freeloadertab, he was given a dispensation releasing him from his vows. He never felt theneed to escape. He took oʃ his robe, put on civilian clothes, and walked away.His spiritual adviser gave him ɹve hundred dollars to help him out. He wasnever punished or fined, or made to disconnect from anyone.IN TRUTH, the IRS was ill equipped to make a case in court that Scientology—orany other creed—was not a religion. Moreover, the commissioner of the IRS,Fred T. Goldberg, Jr., had to balance the longing on the part of some of hisexecutives to destroy the church against the need to keep his resources, bothhuman and ɹnancial, from being sucked into the black hole that Scientology hadcreated.One afternoon in Washington, in October 1991, Miscavige and Rathbun werehaving lunch at the Bombay Club, a swank Indian restaurant near the WhiteHouse. Miscavige was fed up with the stalemate, which looked as if it could goon forever, in an endless stream of billable hours to the church’s attorneys. Atthe lunch, Miscavige announced to Gerald Feʃer, one of their lawyers, “Martyand I are just going to bypass you entirely. We’re going to see Fred.”Feʃer laughed at the thought that Miscavige would talk directly to thecommissioner.“I’m not joking,” Miscavige said. “Marty, do you want to go?”The two men hailed a cab after lunch and went to 1111 Constitution Avenue,the IRS headquarters, and announced to the security oɽcer that they wanted tosee the commissioner.“Is he expecting you?”“No, but if you phone him on the intercom and tell him we are from the"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Church of Scientology, I’m sure he’d love to see us.”Within a few moments, several of the commissioner’s aides came down to thelobby. Miscavige told them that he wanted to bury the hatchet. He said he knewhow much hatred there was on each side, going back for decades, and that anintervention from the top was necessary. An hour later there was a call in theirhotel room saying the commissioner would see them the following week.In that ɹrst meeting with Goldberg, in a drab government conference room ata giant table, Miscavige, Rathbun, and Heber Jentzsch were facing about adozen upper-level government bureaucrats, including the commissioner. Thelevel of distrust between the negotiating parties was extreme, made evengreater for the IRS representatives who knew that Scientologists had stolendocuments and wiretapped meetings in that very building. Both sides had anincentive to bring the hostilities to an end, however. Miscavige and Rathbunmade their carefully rehearsed presentation. Miscavige recited a litany ofexamples in which he felt the IRS had singled out Scientology for unfairtreatment. “Am I lying?” he would turn and ask Rathbun theatrically. Rathbunhad a briefcase stuʃed with documents obtained from the 2,300 Freedom ofInformation Act lawsuits the church had ɹled, or the countless public recordsthat the church had combed through. Among the many internal memos theScientologists had gathered was one they called the Final Solution document. Itwas the minutes of a meeting in 1974 of several top IRS executives who weretrying to deɹne “religion” in a manner that excluded Scientology but not otherfaiths.Miscavige made it clear that the barrage of lawsuits lodged against the IRSwould come to an immediate halt if the church got what it wanted, which wasan unqualiɹed exemption for all of its activities. When Miscavige ɹnished hispresentation, Goldberg called for a break, but he signaled to Rathbun to hangback. Goldberg asked him privately if the government settled, wouldScientology also turn off the personal attacks in Freedom magazine?“Like a faucet,” Rathbun told him.Goldberg appointed his deputy commissioner, John Burke, who had no historywith the conɻict, to oversee a lengthy review of Scientology’s ɹnances andpractices. That process went on for two years. During that time, Rathbun andMiscavige commuted to Washington nearly every week, toting banker’s boxesstuʃed with responses to the government’s queries. Two hundred Scientologistsin Los Angeles and New York were mobilized to go through the books of thechurch’s tangled bureaucracy. The odds against success were high; the courts hadrepeatedly sided with the IRS’s assertion that the Church of Scientology was a"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"commercial enterprise. Miscavige and Rathbun were very much aware that thefuture of Scientology, if there was one, awaited the result of the IRS probe.Either the panel would rule against them, in which case the church’s tax liabilityfor the previous two decades would destroy it, or they would fall under thegracious protection of the freedom of religion clause of the First Amendment, inwhich case the Church of Scientology, and all its practices, would be shelteredby the US Constitution.Overshadowing this debate was an incident that renewed the public concernabout the dangerousness of totalistic movements. In February 1993, agents forthe US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms tried to execute a searchwarrant on a religious commune a few miles east of Waco, Texas, that was runby a Christian apocalyptic group calling themselves the Branch Davidians. Theleader, David Koresh, was stockpiling weapons, practicing polygamy,committing statutory rape, and was said to be physically abusing children,although that last charge was never proved. Following a shoot-out that causedthe deaths of four government agents and six Branch Davidians, the FBI began asiege lasting nearly two months and culminating in a catastrophic blaze—broadcast all over the world—that consumed the entire compound. Seventy-ɹvemembers of the sect died in the ɹnal assault, including twenty-ɹve children. TheWaco siege threatened to create a backlash against all new religious movements.On the other hand, the government’s handling of the siege, and the disastrousɹnale, provoked an international uproar. The hazards of unorthodox belief wereclearly displayed, as were the limitations of police forces to understand and dealwith fanatical movements.On October 8, more than a thousand Scientologists stood and cheered in theLos Angeles Sports Arena as Miscavige announced, “The war is over!” The IRShad settled with the church. Although the terms were secret, they were laterleaked to the Wall Street Journal. Instead of the $1 billion bill for back taxes andpenalties that the church owed, Scientology agreed to pay just $12.5 million toresolve outstanding disputes; the church also agreed to stop the cascade oflawsuits against the agency. In return, the IRS dropped its investigations. “Themagnitude of this is greater than you can imagine,” Miscavige said that night atthe Sports Arena. He held up a thick folder of the letters of exemption for everyone of the church’s 150 American entities. The victory over the IRS was total, heexplained. It gave Scientology ɹnancial advantages that were unusual, perhapsunique, among religions in the United States. For instance, schools usingHubbard educational methods received tax exemption. Eighty percent ofindividual auditing on the part of members was now a tax-deductible expense."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Two Scientology publishing houses that were solely dedicated to turning outHubbard’s books, including his commercial ɹction, also gained the taxexemption. The church even gained the power to extend its tax exemption toany of its future branches—“They will no longer need to apply to the IRS,”Miscavige marveled. From now on, the church could make its own decisionsabout which of its activities were exempt.“And what about all those battles and wars still being fought overseas?”Miscavige continued. “Well, there’s good news on that front, too.” In the past,he observed, foreign governments would say, “You are an American religion. Ifthe IRS doesn’t recognize you, why should we?” As a part of the settlement,Miscavige revealed, the agency agreed to send notices to every country in theworld, explaining what Scientology was. “It is very complete and veryaccurate,” Miscavige said of the government brochure. “How do I know? Wewrote it!”Miscavige summed up the mood in the Sports Arena: “The future is ours.”A MONTH AFTER the church’s historic triumph over the IRS in 1993, Rathbun blew.He had come to see Miscavige in a diʃerent light during the two years theylabored over the tax case. The last six months of the tax case had beenparticularly arduous. During that period, he slept only about four hours a night.The former athlete was a physical wreck. “I’m only doing this for LRH,” he toldhimself, as he and Miscavige ate dinners together night after night inWashington and trudged back to the Four Seasons in Georgetown. “I’m not goingto be this guy’s bitch for the rest of my life.”No doubt the stress aʃected Miscavige as well. On the night of his big victoryspeech in the Sports Arena, Miscavige showed up for a run-through, but thestage manager, Stefan Castle, was still ɹddling with the cues for a complicatedlaser and pyrotechnic display. According to Castle, Miscavige stormed out intothe arena and began to strangle him. Miscavige let him go before any real harmwas done, but it was an alarming signal. Amy Scobee, head of the CelebrityCentre at the time, also noted that Miscavige’s personality began to shiftimmediately after the IRS decision, becoming more aggressive and hostile. Atthe party at the Celebrity Centre following his speech, Miscavige rudely shovedher aside as he entered. “You just want to get rid of me,” she remembers himsaying.As far as Rathbun was concerned, it didn’t help that Miscavige scarcelyacknowledged him in the speech that night. Immediately after the event,"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"reporters from The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times were callingRathbun to ask about Miscavige’s salary, which had been disclosed in the IRSdocuments. Miscavige and his wife together were making more than $100,000 ayear—not an extraordinary ɹgure by the standards of world religious leaders,but quite a contrast to the $30 a week most of the Sea Org members wereearning. Miscavige was outraged by the impertinence of the reporters, andRathbun felt that he was taking it out on him. This was all coming at a timewhen he had been postponing a ɹnal visit to see his father, who was dying ofcancer.The St. Petersburg Times published an editorial demanding that Congressinvestigate the tax-exemption decision. Rathbun was sent to Florida to turnaround the Times editorial board, who were not at all persuaded by hisarguments. Miscavige was furious that Rathbun failed to handle the situation.One evening, Shelly Miscavige called everyone in Rathbun’s oɽce together, andin front of his subordinates she stripped the captain’s bars off his uniform.The next day, Rathbun took four gold Krugerrands that he had stored in asafe, got on his motorcycle, and drove to Yuma, Arizona. He called his father inLos Angeles from a bar, but a church oɽcial answered. He was waiting therewith Rathbun’s wife, Anne, who begged him to come back. Rathbun felt guiltyand conɻicted. Drinking steadily, he somehow made it to San Antonio, althoughhe was in frequent communication with church leaders. He ɹnally agreed to callMiscavige, who apologized for his treatment. “You know the kind of pressure Iwas under. Please just see me,” the church leader said, adding that he could bein San Antonio in a matter of hours. “No, I want to see the Alamo,” Rathbun toldhim. They agreed to meet for dinner at the Marriott in New Orleans two dayslater.That evening, Miscavige showed a chastened, vulnerable side of himself thatRathbun had never seen before. According to Rathbun, Miscavige promised to“cease acting like a madman.” He praised Rathbun for his part in gaining the IRSexemption. “Because you did this,” he declared, “you’re Kha-Khan.” It was a titlethat Hubbard had come up with in one of his policy letters for a highlyproductive staʃ member, but in the culture it was understood that such a personwould be forgiven for misdeeds in future lifetimes. Hubbard had awarded it toYvonne Gillham after she died. Rathbun knew that Miscavige was manipulatinghim, but he was touched nonetheless. As a further reward, Miscavige oʃeredRathbun the opportunity to go to the Scientology ship, the Freewinds, and cruisethe Caribbean for two years doing nothing but studying and training to be anauditor. Rathbun could finally obtain OT III. It was an offer he couldn’t resist."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"That was a rewarding time for Rathbun. But as soon as he got oʃ the shipafter his time away, Miscavige called him into his oɽce and said, “I ɹnallyknow who my SP is. The two years you were gone was the only unenturbulatedtime in my life.” He ordered him to Clearwater, his rank broken, as a trainee.That didn’t last, either. A number of tabloid sensations arose surroundingScientology celebrities—Lisa Marie Presley was divorcing Michael Jackson,Kirstie Alley was divorcing actor Parker Stevenson—and Miscavige again turnedto Rathbun to cool the press down.Then, on December 5, 1995, a Scientologist named Lisa McPherson diedfollowing a mental breakdown. She had rear-ended a boat that was being towedin downtown Clearwater, Florida, near the church’s spiritual headquarters.When paramedics arrived, she stripped oʃ her clothes and wandered nakeddown the street. She said she needed help and was taken to a nearby hospital.Soon afterward, a delegation of ten Scientologists arrived at the hospital andpersuaded McPherson to check out, against doctors’ advice. McPherson spent thenext seventeen days under guard in room 174 of the Fort Harrison Hotel.For Scientologists, McPherson’s mental breakdown presented a confoundingdilemma. McPherson had been declared Clear just three months before, after tenyears of courses and auditing and substantial contributions to the church. Theprocess had been like “a gopher being pulled through a garden hose,” she latersaid, but it had been worth it. “I am so full of life I am overwhelmed at the joyof it all!” she wrote. “WOW!”Clears are supposed to be invulnerable to mental frailty. People on the baseknew that McPherson had been acting strangely before her breakdown. MartyRathbun, who was at Flag Base during this time, remembers seeing McPhersonscreaming in the hallways of the Fort Harrison Hotel, because she had just beendeclared Clear. “Aaaaaah! Yahoo!” she cried. She looked insane. How did she getto be Clear when she was obviously irrational? And who was responsible fordeciding that she had achieved that state? According to Rathbun and severalother former church oɽcials who were present at the time, the case supervisorwho pronounced Lisa McPherson Clear was David Miscavige. He had gone toFlag in the summer of 1995 to take over the auditing delivered at the base. Hewould also supervise the treatment of McPherson that followed.4When McPherson entered room 174, she was a lovely, shapely young woman.She underwent an Introspection Rundown, the same procedure that Hubbardhad developed on the Apollo two decades earlier to treat psychotic behavior. Itinvolved placing McPherson in solitary conɹnement and providing her withwater, food, and vitamin supplements. All communication had to be in writing."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Instead of calming down, McPherson stopped eating. She screamed, she clawedher attendants, she spoke in gibberish, she fouled herself, she banged her headagainst the wall. Staʃ members strapped her down and tried to feed her with aturkey baster.On December 5, McPherson slipped into a coma. When church membersdecided to take her to the hospital that night, they bypassed the Morton PlantHospital, just down the street, where McPherson had originally been seen, anddrove her forty-ɹve minutes away, passing four other hospitals, to the ColumbiaNew Port Richey Hospital, where there was a doctor aɽliated with the church.The woman they ɹnally wheeled into the emergency room was skeletally thinand covered with scratches, bruises, and dark brown lesions. She was also dead.She had suʃered a pulmonary embolism on the way to the hospital. In the eyesof the world press, Scientology had murdered Lisa McPherson. She was one ofnine Scientologists who had died under mysterious circumstances at theClearwater facility.The night after McPherson died, Rathbun got word from church oɽcials towait for a call at a pay phone at a nearby Holiday Inn. “Why aren’t you all overthis mess?” Miscavige demanded, when Rathbun answered the call. “The policeare poking around. Do something.”Rathbun discovered that church oɽcials in Clearwater had already lied in twosworn statements to the police, claiming that McPherson hadn’t been subjectedto an Introspection Rundown. The church’s oɽcial response, under Rathbun’sdirection, was to continue to lie, stating that McPherson had been at thechurch’s Fort Harrison Hotel only for “rest and relaxation” and there wasnothing unusual about her stay. In the meantime, Rathbun went through the logsthat McPherson’s attendants had kept. As many as twenty people had beenrotating in and out of McPherson’s room; some of them were scratched andbruised from trying to subdue her; that was hardly the isolation and absolutesilence and calm that the Introspection Rundown called for. Rathbun noted that,among other entries in the logs, one of the caretakers admitted that the situationwas out of control and that McPherson needed to see a doctor. In the presenceof a Scientology lawyer, Rathbun handed several of the most incriminating logsto a church executive, and said, “Lose ’em.”The McPherson case loomed over the church for ɹve years, with an ongoingpolice investigation, protests in front of Scientology facilities, lawsuits on thepart of the family, and endless unwanted press. Embarrassing details emerged,including the fact that McPherson had spent $176,700 on Scientology services inher last ɹve years, but she had died with only $11 in her savings account."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"Rathbun and Mike Rinder, the church’s spokesman, were responsible formanaging the situation, but Miscavige supervised every detail. The level oftension was nearly unbearable.Rinder had the particularly unrewarding task of defending the church to thepublic. He was articulate and seemingly unɻappable, and he had a talent fordisarming hostile interviewers. He had been a Scientologist since he was ɹveyears old, in South Australia, when the religion was banned. He had sailed withHubbard aboard the Apollo. Few had a deeper experience of the religion than heand no one was more publicly identiɹed with it. But even Rinder could not quellthe furor that arose from the McPherson affair.Perhaps because of Rinder’s lifelong service to the church, Miscavige saw himas a rival; or perhaps the leader’s frustration with the continual bad press madehis spokesperson a particular object of his wrath. At any rate, Marty Rathbungot a call from Shelly Miscavige around Christmas in 1997, the ɹrst year of theprotests over Lisa McPherson’s death. Rathbun was back at Gold Base. Shellysaid that Dave wanted him to report to his quarters right away. Rathbun rusheddown the hill to Miscavige’s bungalow, where Shelly was waiting just outsidethe screen door. A moment later, Mike Rinder, who had also been summoned,came racing around the corner of the house. According to both men, the screendoor suddenly ɻew open and Miscavige came out, wearing a terry-clothbathrobe. According to Rathbun and Rinder, Miscavige hit Rinder in the face andstomach, then grabbed him around the neck and slammed him into a tree.Rinder fell into the ivy, where Miscavige continued kicking him several times.5Rathbun just stood there, stunned and puzzled about why he had been orderedto watch this display. Afterward, he decided that he was there to back upMiscavige in case Rinder had the nerve to resist. He was the “silent enforcer.”Rathbun’s management of the defense in the McPherson case was one of hismost successful accomplishments for the church. The medical examiner in thecase, Joan Wood, had vehemently denied the church’s assertion that LisaMcPherson’s illness and death were sudden. Her health had obviouslydeteriorated over a long period. She had been without liquids for at least ɹvedays, the medical examiner told a reporter, saying, “This is the most severe caseof dehydration I’ve ever seen.” She ruled that the cause of death wasundetermined, and the State of Florida ɹled criminal charges against the church.If the church were to be convicted of a felony, it could lead to the loss of its taxexemption and then its probable extinction.Miscavige and his team brought to bear Scientology’s two greatest assets,money and celebrity. The church was building up a strong defense in its case by"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"hiring some of the most prestigious medical examiners and forensic scientists inthe country—experts who questioned Joan Wood’s conclusion that the likelycause of death was a blood clot caused by dehydration. One of the local lawyersretained by the church arranged a personal meeting between Miscavige andWood’s attorney, Jeʃrey Goodis. Miscavige and Rathbun made a number ofpresentations to Goodis, trying to persuade him that his client was in legaljeopardy because of her ruling in the McPherson case. Wood was known as anunɻappable witness and a formidable opponent to defense attorneys; hertestimony would be crucial if the case went to trial. Rathbun says that Miscavigerepeatedly warned Goodis that the church was going to discredit his client andsue her “into the Stone Age.” Four months before the McPherson case was set togo to trial, Joan Wood changed her ruling to say that McPherson’s death was“accidental.” The State’s case collapsed, charges against the church weredropped, and Wood avoided a lawsuit. Wood retired and became a recluse. Shetold the St. Petersburg Times that she suʃered panic attacks and insomnia. (Shedied of a stroke in 2011.)The civil case against the church on the part of McPherson’s family continued,however, along with the negative publicity. Tom De Vocht, who was head of theFlag Land Base in Clearwater, says he arranged a meeting with Mary Repper, aninɻuential political consultant who had led the campaigns of many of the stateand local oɽcials in the area, including the state attorney who had ɹled thecriminal charges against the church. Repper had the reputation of being anti-Scientology, but she agreed to have lunch with Rinder, Rathbun, and Miscavigeat the Fort Harrison Hotel. It turned out that she was a fan of the soap-operastar Michelle Staʃord, who was a Scientologist. Repper was invited to LosAngeles to meet her at a Celebrity Centre gala. When she returned, Repperbegan hosting a series of dinners and lunches for local oɽcials to meet otherScientology celebrities. Tom Cruise dropped by Repper’s house on severaloccasions to enjoy her famous coconut cake and schmooze with local oɽcialsincluding the mayor of Tampa and inɻuential lawyers and judges. He showedclips of his movies and testiɹed about how Scientology had changed his life. FoxNews host Greta van Susteren provided sunset cruises on her yacht. Repper helda brunch for Michelle Staʃord; the guests were mainly women who were fans ofThe Young and the Restless, including the secretaries of local judges. Meantime,the church threw black-tie galas in the ballroom of the Fort Harrison Hotel,where Edgar Winter, Chick Corea, or Isaac Hayes would perform. The PinellasCounty sheriʃ attended these events, along with the mayors of Clearwater andTampa, as well as a number of lawyers and judges who had been targeted by the"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"church as community leaders. Rathbun says that when Miscavige learned thatJeʃrey Goodis and his wife were big fans of John Travolta, they were invited toa gala at the Fort Harrison Hotel, and Travolta was asked to thank them fortheir help. Rathbun says the star was told, “This guy is really going to bat forus.”The church poured money into local charities. According to Rathbun andRinder, the idea was to change the climate of public opinion and therebyinɻuence the attitude of the courts toward the church. Rathbun says there was aparallel campaign to discredit Lisa McPherson’s family as golddiggers who wereexploiting their daughter’s death.In a recent deposition, Rathbun estimated that the entire campaign to shutdown the prosecution of the church cost over $20 to $30 million. (The civil suitbrought by the family settled for an undisclosed sum in 2004.)SCIENTOLOGY WAS UNDER ATTACK elsewhere in the world as well. Germany, acutelysensitive to the danger of extremist movements, viewed Scientology withparticular alarm. In Hamburg, in 1992, the state parliament created acommission to investigate “destructive groups,” a category that included theChurch of Satan, Transcendental Meditation, and the Uniɹcation Church, butwas mainly aimed at Scientology. Scientologists were barred from holdinggovernment jobs and forbidden to join Germany’s main political party, theChristian Democratic Union, because they weren’t considered Christians. Theyouth wing of the party organized boycotts of Cruise’s ɹrst Mission: Impossibleand Travolta’s movie Phenomenon. The city of Stuttgart canceled a concert byChick Corea when it was discovered that he was a Scientologist. Seventy percentof Germans favored the idea of banning the organization altogether.The 1990s saw the rise of apocalyptic movements in many diʃerent countries.As the millennium drew near, the theme of science ɹction and UFOs becameespecially pronounced and deadly. In October 1994, police in Switzerland,investigating a ɹre in a farmhouse, discovered a hidden room with eighteencorpses wearing ceremonial garments, arranged like spokes in a wheel. Otherbodies were found elsewhere on the farm. Their heads were covered with plasticbags; some had been shot or beaten. The next day, three chalets burned inanother Swiss village. Investigators found more than two dozen bodies in theruins. They had been poisoned. Some of the dead had been lured to the sceneand murdered, but most were followers of Joseph Di Mambro, a French jeweler,who had created a new religion, the Order of the Solar Temple. Di Mambro’s"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"chief lieutenant, a charismatic Belgian obstetrician named Luc Journet, preachedthat after death the members would be picked up by a spaceship and reunited onthe star Sirius. Like Hubbard, Journet had been inɻuenced by Aleister Crowleyand the Ordo Templi Orientis. A year after these macabre incidents, the burnedcorpses of sixteen other members of the group were found in Grenoble, France;then, in 1997, ɹve more members of the order burned themselves to death inQuebec, making a total of seventy-four deaths. In contrast to the BranchDavidians or the followers of Jim Jones, who were predominantly lower class,the members of the Solar Temple were aʀuent, well-educated members of thecommunities they lived in, with families and regular jobs, and yet they hadgiven themselves over to a mystical science-ɹction fantasy that turned them intokillers, suicides, or helpless victims.In March 1995, adherents of a Japanese movement called Aum Shinrikyo(“Supreme Truth”) attacked ɹve subway trains in Tokyo with sarin gas. Twelvecommuters died; thousands more might have if the gas had been more highlyreɹned. It was later discovered that this was just one of at least fourteen attacksthe group staged in order to set oʃ a chain of events intended to result in anapocalyptic world war. The leader of the group, Shoko Asahara, a blind yogainstructor, combined the tenets of Buddhism with notions drawn from IsaacAsimov’s Foundation Trilogy, which depicts a secretive group of scientists whoare preparing to take over the world. Many of Asahara’s followers were indeedscientists and engineers from top Japanese universities who were enchanted bythis scheme. They purchased military hardware in the former Soviet Union andsought to acquire nuclear warheads. When that failed, they bought a sheep farmin Western Australia that happened to be atop a rich vein of uranium. Theycultivated chemical and biological weapons, such as anthrax, Ebola virus,cyanide, and VX gas. They had used such agents in previous attacks, but failed tocreate the kind of mass slaughter they hoped would bring on civil war andnuclear Armageddon. Still, Aum exposed the narrow boundary between religiouscultism and terror, which would soon become more obvious with the rise of al-Qaeda. A spokesperson for the Church of Scientology in New Zealand explainedthat the source of Aum Shinrikyo’s crimes was the practice of psychiatry inJapan.Just as the debate in Germany was coming to a climax, in March 1997, thirty-nine members of a group calling itself Heaven’s Gate committed suicide in a SanDiego mansion. They apparently had hoped to time their deaths in order toascend to a spacecraft that they believed was following Comet Hale-Bopp.Marshall Applewhite, their leader, a former choirmaster, represented himself as"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"a reincarnated Jesus who was receiving guidance from the television show StarTrek.Although Scientology has persecuted its critics and defectors, it has neverengaged in mass murder or suicides; however, the public anxiety surroundingthese sensational events added to the rancor and fear that welled up inGermany. Could Scientology also turn violent? There were elements mixed intothese various groups that resembled some features of Scientology—magicalbeliefs and science ɹction being the most obvious. Past lives were a commontheme. Like Aum Shinrikyo, Scientology has ties to Buddhist notions ofenlightenment and Hindu beliefs in karma and reincarnation. Structurally, AumShinrikyo was the most similar to Scientology, having both a public membershipand a cloistered clergy, like the Sea Org, called renunciates, who carried outdirectives that the larger organization knew little or nothing about. When theattacks on the subway took place, Aum’s membership in Japan was estimated tobe about 10,000, with an additional 30,000 in Russia, and some scatteredpockets worldwide, with resources close to $1 billion—ɹgures that comparewith some estimates of Scientology today. What separated these groups fromScientology was their orientation toward apocalypse and their yearning for theend-time. That has never been a feature of Scientology. Clearly, however, thelure of totalistic religious movements deɹes easy categorization. Such groupscan arise anywhere and spread like viruses, and it is impossible to know whichones will turn lethal, or why.Both the German government and the Scientologists viewed their strugglethrough the prism of Germany’s Nazi past. Ursula Caberta, the head of theHamburg anti-Scientology task force, compared Hubbard’s Introduction toScientology Ethics to Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf: “Hitler was thinking that theAryans were going to rule the world, the untermenschen. The philosophy of L.Ron Hubbard is the same.” In response to such statements, in January 1997 agroup of Hollywood celebrities, agents, lawyers, and movie executives publisheda full-page open letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the International HeraldTribune. “Hitler made religious intolerance oɽcial government policy,” theletter stated. “In the 1930s it was the Jews. Today it is the Scientologists.” Theletter compared the boycotts of Cruise, Travolta, and Corea to Nazi book-burnings. The letter was written and paid for by Bertram Fields, then the mostpowerful lawyer in Hollywood, whose clients included Travolta and Cruise.None of the thirty-four signatories of the document were Scientologists, butmany were Jews. Most of them—such as Oliver Stone, Dustin Hoʃman, andGoldie Hawn—had worked with the two stars or were friends or clients of"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Fields.Entertainment Tonight sent the actress Anne Archer, a well-knownScientologist, to Germany on a “fact-ɹnding mission.” She later testiɹed beforethe US Congress, as did other Scientology celebrities—Travolta, Corea, and IsaacHayes—about the suppression of religious freedom in Germany. “Individualsand businesses throughout Germany are routinely required to sign a declaration,referred to as a ‘sect ɹlter,’ swearing that they are not Scientologists,” Travoltatold Congress. “Failure to sign means that companies will not hire them, tradeunions will not admit them, they will not be permitted to join social groups,banks will not open accounts for them, and they are even excluded from sportsclubs, solely because of their religion.”In April, John Travolta met with President Bill Clinton at a conference onvolunteerism in Philadelphia. It was a freighted moment for the president, sinceTravolta was portraying a character based on him in the forthcoming moviePrimary Colors. “He said he wanted to help me out with the situation inGermany,” Travolta later said. “He had a roommate years ago who was aScientologist and had really liked him, and respected his views on it. He said hefelt we were given an unfair hand in that country, and that he wanted to ɹx it.”Clinton set up a meeting for Travolta and Cruise with Sandy Berger, his nationalsecurity advisor, who was given the additional assignment of being theadministration’s “Scientology point person.”None of this had any eʃect on Travolta’s character in the ɹlm, as the moviehad already been shot, nor on Germany’s policy toward the church, whichrefused to recognize Scientology as a religion or allow members to join politicalparties. However, the US State Department began pressuring the Germangovernment on behalf of Scientology. The Germans were puzzled that theirAmerican counterparts seemed not to know or care about the church’s RPFcamps, which the Germans called penal colonies, and the reported practices ofconɹnement, forced confessions, and punishing physical labor, which they saidamounted to brainwashing. There was a belief within the German cabinet thatthe church’s real goal was to inɹltrate the government and create a Scientologysuperstate. “This is not a church or a religious organization,” the labor minister,Norbert Blum, told Maclean’s magazine. “Scientology is a machine formanipulating human beings.”1 Behar says that a private investigator, posing as a distraught parent, called him and begged for help with"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"a child who had gone into Scientology.

Paul was still seeking joint custody ofhis three daughters. Without consulting him, Diane had taken Lauren andKaty out of the Delphi Academy, apparently intending to enroll them in publicschool. Paul and Diane were ordered by the court to undergo psychiatricevaluation, a procedure that Scientology abhors. In December 1998, the courtsurprised everyone by awarding Paul full custody of his daughters. According tocourt records, the ruling followed the discovery that the girls were not enrolledin school at all.The girls were stunned. They had watched the hostilities through Diane’s eyes.No one had prepared them for the possibility that they might be taken from her—until then, it had been the three girls and their mother against the world. Thegirls thought the decision was unbalanced and unfairly inɻuenced by the factthat their father had more money. Alissa vowed she would never speak to himagain.Haggis was also caught short by the court’s decision. In addition to the year-old son, James, he had with Deborah, he suddenly had two teenage daughters onhis hands as well. (Alissa was twenty-one at the time, and lived on her own.)The girls felt uprooted and they missed the emotional support of their mother.They didn’t resent Deborah; actually, they appreciated her advocacy and theway she balanced out Paul. Still, it was a difficult adjustment for everyone.Paul put the girls in a private school, but that lasted only six months. Theyweren’t entirely comfortable talking to people who weren’t Scientologists, andbasic things like multiple-choice tests were unfamiliar. They demanded to besent to a boarding institution on an isolated hilltop near Sheridan, Oregon,called the Delphian School—or the “mother school,” as it was known toScientologists.Alissa had gone there when she was fourteen years old. It had been a mixedexperience for her. She had brought a copy of The Autobiography of Malcolm Xand books of eighteenth-century poetry, a CD of great speeches by Lincoln andMartin Luther King, and a pack of tarot cards. Although she loved the school,"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"she never felt she ɹt in with the other kids. They wanted to talk about boys andpop culture, and she was more interested in philosophy and religion. ButDelphian was just what Lauren needed. She got intensive tutoring to help herovercome her educational deɹcits; however, she also began to come up againstsome of the constraints of her church.While she was at Delphian, Lauren decided to write a paper about religiousintolerance. In particular, she felt that Scientology was under attack and shecouldn’t understand why. When she went online to see what the opposition wassaying, a fellow student turned her in to Ethics. Lauren was told thatScientologists shouldn’t look at negative stories about their religion. She wassupposed to be saving the planet, so why was she wasting her time reading lies?Because of her isolation, and the censorship imposed on her education, whenLauren ɹnally graduated from high school, at the age of twenty, she had neverheard anyone speak ill of Scientology, nor did she question the ban on researchabout her religion. She thought, “I guess I’m not supposed to do these things. Iwill stay away.” Like her father, she learned it was easier not to look.Alissa had a diʃerent issue. She didn’t really date in high school, and by thetime she got to junior college it began to dawn on her that she was gay. Sheactually wasn’t sure what that meant. She had two uncles who were gay, but forthe longest time she didn’t know what a lesbian was. Then her sister Katy, whois ɹve years younger, and had grown up in the Internet-savvy culture, came outto her parents. Paul told Katy that there was no way that he would ever loveher less. That made it easier for Alissa to talk about what she was discoveringabout herself. The vow never to speak to her father again began to lose its holdon her.All the girls had grown up hearing prejudiced remarks from people in thechurch who saw homosexuality as an “aberration” that undermined the survivalof the species; gays themselves were seen as sinister perverts. These attitudeswere informed by Hubbard’s writings on the subject. But it wasn’t justScientology, Alissa realized; the entire society was biased against homosexuals.In her early twenties, Alissa ɹnally found the courage to come out to her father.“Oh, yeah, I already knew that,” he told her. He said he wondered why she hadever dated boys in the first place.“You knew?” she said. “I didn’t know! How did you know? Why didn’t youtell me? You could have clued me in. It would have made it easier for me.”That was so typical of her father.

Both Cruise and Nicole Kidman were attaining ever greater success;Cruise became the ɹrst actor to star in ɹve consecutive ɹlms to gross more than$100 million in the United States, including Jerry Maguire and the ɹrst Mission:Impossible; Kidman was also gaining international renown with her roles inBatman Forever and To Die For. They gave the impression that they were puttingScientology behind them.In 1996, Marty Rathbun had gone to Los Angeles to audit Cruise, but that onesession went nowhere. According to Rathbun, Miscavige blamed Nicole Kidman,and viewed her as a gold digger who was faking Scientology. He says thatMiscavige was hopeful that if they portrayed Nicole Kidman as a SuppressivePerson, Cruise could be peeled away from her.It was two years before Cruise agreed to go through another bout of auditing.This time, strict secrecy was imposed. Worried about scaring oʃ the tentativestar, Rathbun arranged the sessions so that even top oɽcials in the church wereunaware that Cruise was receiving services. For ɹve days in October 1998,Cruise drove into a private parking lot in the back of the historic GuarantyBuilding on Hollywood Boulevard, with the yellow Scientology sign atop it thatlooms over the fabled district. Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino used tohave their oɽces here. Now the lobby is a shrine to the life and works of L. RonHubbard. A giant bust of the founder greets the occasional visitor. Embedded inthe sidewalk in front of the building are the stars of bygone celebrities on theHollywood Walk of Fame—Otto Kruger, Tony Martin, Ann Rutherford, RichardCarlson, Jetta Goudal, Paul Winchell—who had their own moments of greatrenown and are now largely forgotten.Cruise went in a back door that led to a basement hallway. There was anelevator at the end of the hallway that went directly to the “secret” eleventhɻoor, where both Miscavige and Rathbun maintained oɽces. The World Serieswas under way—New York versus San Diego—and Cruise wore his Yankees hat.“He was not in good shape, spiritually or mentally,” Rathbun observed. “He waspersonally very enturbulated.”After that episode of auditing, Cruise went quiet again. He and Kidman werein England ɹlming Eyes Wide Shut for Stanley Kubrick. In any case, Rathbun and"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Miscavige had their hands full, fending oʃ the lawsuits and reporters swirlingaround the McPherson case. Rathbun said that, in January 2001, he got a callfrom Cruise asking for help. Cruise said that he and Kidman were finished.Cruise never oʃered a public explanation for the divorce, and Kidman herselfwas clearly surprised by his decision. She later revealed that she had suʃered amiscarriage two months after Cruise moved out, and she had asked the doctorsto preserve samples of the fetus’s DNA to prove that Cruise was the father. Shepleaded with him to undergo marriage counseling at the church. Cruise refused,publicly declaring, “Nic knows exactly why we are getting a divorce.”This was a decisive moment in Cruise’s relationship with Scientology. Rathbunprovided the star with more than two hundred hours of auditing over the nextcouple of years. From July through Thanksgiving, 2001, Rathbun was withCruise at the Celebrity Centre frequently, doing auditing rundowns and thePTS/SP (Potential Trouble Source/Suppressive Persons) course. He pairedCruise with another actor, Jason Beghe, to do training drills; for instance, Beghewould think of a hypothetical date, which Cruise had to ɹgure out, using the E-Meter, an exercise Cruise found really frustrating.A young man named Tommy Davis began acting as Rathbun’s assistant. Hebrought sandwiches and helped out with Cruise’s children, making sure theywere receiving church services. Despite his youth, Davis was already a uniqueɹgure in the church: He was a second-generation Scientologist, a Sea Orgmember, and the scion of the Hollywood elite. His mother was Anne Archer, atalented and popular actress who had starred in a number of movies, includingPatriot Games and Fatal Attraction, for which she was nominated for an AcademyAward. She had been a deeply committed Scientologist since she began studyingwith Milton Katselas at the Beverly Hills Playhouse in her twenties. She hadalways been proud to associate herself with Scientology in public, speaking atinnumerable events on behalf of the church. Her son Tommy embodied theaspiration of the church to establish itself in the Hollywood community; indeed,he was living proof that it had done so. He had known Cruise since he waseighteen years old, so it was natural that he soon became the church’s liaisonwith the star, reporting directly to Shelly Miscavige. He had a relationship withCruise similar to the one that Spanky Taylor once enjoyed with John Travolta.Rathbun assigned Davis to sit with Cruise in the parking lot of Home Depot inHollywood while the star was doing his Tone Scale drills—guessing theemotional state of random people coming out of the store.Cruise then took a break to promote his movie Vanilla Sky. The followingFebruary through April 2002, Cruise and Rathbun were once again working"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"together full-time, mostly at Gold Base. Cruise was preparing for his role in TheLast Samurai, directed by Ed Zwick, and between sessions with Rathbun hewould go into the courtyard to practice his swordplay.Cruise had begun dating the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz, and in the fall of2001 Rathbun began auditing her as well. At the same time, he was still actingas Nicole Kidman’s Ethics Oɽcer in the church, even though she and Cruisewere engaged in a bitter divorce proceeding. One of the issues was whether thechildren would be educated in schools using the Hubbard method, which Kidmanopposed. That was another battle she lost. Although Tom and Nicole splitcustody of their children, both Isabella and Connor soon chose to liveexclusively with their father. Rathbun says this was because the Scientologystaʃ, especially Tommy Davis, quietly worked to turn the children againstKidman. “Tommy told them over and over again their mother was a sociopathand after a while they believed him,” he recalled. “They had daily sessions withTommy. I was there. I saw it.”According to several former Sea Org members, Rathbun’s auditing sessionswith Cruise were videotaped. Tom De Vocht, a former church oɽcial, saidMiscavige would watch them and then regale his inner circle, over his nightlywhiskey, with stories of Cruise’s confessions, dwelling especially on his sex life.1Rathbun was opposed to the endless courtship of Cruise. In his opinion, therewas no need for it once Cruise was securely back on the Bridge. Rathbun toldMiscavige, “I think I’m done with this guy.” Miscavige responded, “He’ll be donewhen he calls me.” The leader was galled by the fact that Cruise had nevercontacted him when he came back for counseling. Rathbun continually urgedCruise to call “COB,” as Miscavige is known in the church—Chairman of theBoard. At one point Cruise asked for Miscavige’s number, but then failed to call.His tentativeness was worrisome.Whatever restraint Cruise felt about Miscavige eventually fell away, however,and Miscavige was once again folded into the star’s inner circle. There weremovie nights in Cruise’s mansion. Miscavige ɻew with Cruise in the WarnerBrothers jet to a test screening of The Last Samurai in Arizona. The two menbecame closer than ever. Cruise later said of Miscavige, “I have never met amore competent, a more intelligent, a more compassionate being outside ofwhat I have experienced from LRH. And I’ve met the leaders of leaders. I’ve metthem all.”Cruise’s renewed dedication to Scientology permanently changed therelationship between the church and the Hollywood celebrity community. Cruisepoured millions of dollars into the church—$3 million in 2004 alone. He was not"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"simply a figurehead; he was an activist with an international following. He couldtake the church into places it had never been before. Whenever Cruise traveledabroad to promote his movies, he used the opportunity to lobby foreign leadersand American ambassadors to promote Scientology. Davis usually accompaniedhim on these diplomatic and lobbying missions. Cruise repeatedly consultedwith former President Clinton, lobbying him to get Prime Minister Tony Blair’shelp in getting the Church of Scientology declared a tax-deductible charitableorganization in the United Kingdom. Rathbun was present for one telephone callin which Clinton advised Cruise he would be better served by contacting Blair’swife, Cherie, rather than the prime minister, because she was a lawyer and“would understand the details.” Later, Cruise went to London, where he metwith a couple of Blair’s representatives, although nothing came of those eʃorts.In 2003, he met with Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and VicePresident Dick Cheney’s chief of staʃ, Scooter Libby, to express the church’sconcerns over its treatment in Germany. Cruise had access to practically anyonein the world.That same year, Cruise and Davis lobbied Rod Paige, the secretary ofeducation during the ɹrst term of President George W. Bush, to endorseHubbard’s study tech educational methods. Paige had been impressed. Formonths, Cruise kept in contact with Paige’s oɽce, urging that Scientologytechniques be folded into the president’s No Child Left Behind program. One dayCruise ɻew his little red-and-white-striped Pitts Special biplane, designed foraerobatics, to Hemet, along with his Scientologist chief of staʃ, Michael Doven.Miscavige and Rathbun picked them up and drove them to Gold Base. Rathbunwas in the backseat and recalls Cruise boasting to COB about his talks with thesecretary.“Bush may be an idiot,” Miscavige observed, “but I wouldn’t mind his beingour Constantine.”Cruise agreed. “If fucking Arnold can be governor, I could be president.”Miscavige responded, “Well, absolutely, Tom.”2IN 2001, Haggis was ɹred from Family Law, the show he had created. His career,which for so long seemed to be a limitless staircase toward fame and fortune,now took a plunge. He began working at home.Within a week, he started writing a movie script called Million Dollar Baby,based on a series of short stories by F. X. Toole. He spent a year working on it,drawing upon some of his own painful memories. He identiɹed with the"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"character of a sour old boxing coach, Frankie Dunn.

All of the loss and longing hefeels for his daughter is apparent in his mentoring of this gritty young ɹghter,who has more faith in him than he has in himself. But Maggie is paralyzed whenher neck is broken in a ɹght. In a climactic moment, she begs Frankie to pull theplug and let her die. Haggis faced a similar choice in real life with his bestfriend, who was brain-dead from a staph infection. “They don’t die easily,” herecalled. “Even in a coma, he kicked and moaned for twelve hours.”Haggis dreamed of directing the movie himself. But as much as studiosadmired the writing, the story was so dark nobody wanted to get near it. Haggisbegan borrowing money to stay aɻoat. He turned down another TV seriesbecause he realized that his heart hadn’t been in television for years.One of his abandoned TV projects still haunted him. The idea sprang from anunsettling incident a decade before, when he and Diane were driving home fromthe premiere of Silence of the Lambs. Paul was wearing a tuxedo and driving aPorsche convertible. He stopped at a Blockbuster Video store on WilshireBoulevard to rent some obscure Dutch ɹlm. When they got back into the car,two young black men with guns suddenly rushed up to them. The robbersordered them out of the car and told them to walk toward a dark parking lot.That seemed like a really bad idea. Haggis pretended not to hear them. He putDiane in front of him and headed down Wilshire instead.“Stop!”Paul and Diane froze. They heard footsteps, and one of the thieves snatchedthe video out of Diane’s hand. Then the Porsche roared oʃ. That was the lastHaggis ever saw of it.Ten years later, Haggis awakened in the middle of the night and beganchewing over this frightening episode once again. He often thought about it. Theentire experience had lasted less than a minute, but it had colored his stancetoward life in complicated ways. Where did these kids come from? They wereliving in the same city as he, but a universe of race and class separated them. Hecould imagine who he was in their eyes, just some rich white guy with muchmore than his share of what life had to oʃer. In a way, Haggis was on their side.But it could have turned out so much worse; guns always make thingsdangerously unpredictable. He was shaken by that thought. The unexpected codaof snatching the rented videotape was intriguing. Haggis had managed a"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"wisecrack to the cops at the time. “I think you’ll discover that these men havebeen here quite often, looking for that video, and it was never in.”Speciɹcally, what he thought about in the middle of the night was what thosekids said to each other as they sped out of the Blockbuster parking lot ontoWilshire in his pearlescent Cabriolet. Could he ɹnd himself in them? Haggis gotout of bed and began writing. By mid-morning he had a lengthy outline. It wasabout the manifold ways that people interact with each other—how theexperience of having someone honk at you in traɽc and shoot you the ɹngercan aʃect your mood, so that you take it out on someone else at the ɹrstopportunity; or how, alternatively, someone lets you into a long line of traɽc,and your day brightens. He saw life in America as a volatile collision of cultures—of immigrants who fail to read the codes that underlie our system, of racesthat resent and mistrust each other, of people coexisting in diʃerent social stratawho look at each other with uncomprehending fear and hatred.He had shopped the proposal around to diʃerent television producers, butthey unanimously passed on it. Now, as he was struggling ɹnancially andartistically, Deborah suggested he consider writing the script as a movie. “You’llwin an Academy Award,” she told him.Haggis contacted his friend Robert Moresco, who had been a writer onHaggis’s series EZ Streets. He told Moresco, “I don’t think anybody’s going tomake this, but it’s a great story.” The two men began working in Haggis’s homeoɽce, next to the laundry room. They wrote a ɹrst draft in two weeks. Haggisdecided to call it Crash.The title refers to a fender bender that sets oʃ a chain of events, revealing thecontradictory elements of the characters and the city they inhabit. In thedizzying seconds after the collision an LAPD detective suddenly realizes what’smissing in his life. “It’s the sense of touch,” he says in the movie’s opening lines.“In LA no one touches you.... We’re always behind metal and glass. Think wemiss that touch so much, we crash into each other just to feel something.”Haggis insists on turning his heroes into villains and vice versa, such as theracist white cop who molests a tony, upper-class black woman in one scene,then saves her life in another. Haggis felt that by exploring such complexities hewas teasing out the dark and light threads of his own personality.For the next year and a half, he struggled to get the movie green-lit. He wasstill a ɹrst-time movie director, and that posed an obstacle. Moreover, the scriptcalled for an ensemble cast with no single starring role—always an obstacle inHollywood. Haggis ɹnally interested a producer, Bob Yari, who agreed to makethe movie for $10 million if Haggis could assemble a star-studded cast."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Don Cheadle was the ɹrst to sign on, both as an actor and a producer, and hisname added credibility to the project. Matt Dillon and Tony Danza came aboard.Heath Ledger and John Cusack agreed to work for scale, as everyone did. Still,the project dragged on. Finally, Haggis was told the movie was a go. He thensent the script to John Travolta and Kelly Preston, who he thought would beperfect as the district attorney and his wife.“That’s great, because now we really need them,” one of the producers, CathySchulman, told him the next day. Heath Ledger had dropped out and Cusack wasnot far behind. Once again, the movie would need more big-name stars to getthe ɹnancing. Haggis immediately sent a note to Preston, telling her he waswithdrawing his oʃer. As a matter of pride, he felt it was wrong to use hisfriends in such a way—especially other Scientologists. Preston was miʃed, sincehe had failed to explain his decision.Priscilla Presley, John Travolta, and Kelly Preston at the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre’s thirty-seventh-anniversary gala,Hollywood, August 2006But without two more signature names the movie was back in limbo. Haggiswas about to lose Cheadle as well, because he was scheduled to make HotelRwanda. Yari finally told Haggis to shut the production down.The following Monday, when Schulman came into the production oɽce, shefound Haggis there, alone.“What are you doing?” she asked."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"“I’m prepping the movie.”Yari agreed to keep the oɽce open for one more week, and then another, aseach Monday Schulman would ɹnd Haggis at work preparing for a movie thatnow had no budget at all. Gradually, other people began working with him, forno pay.“If you get Sandy Bullock, you got a green light,” Schulman told him.Haggis got Sandra Bullock for the role of the district attorney’s wife, a brittle,racist socialite, a role far from the plucky gamines she had played in the past. Inthe movie, she’s the one who gets carjacked at gunpoint. But the producerswanted one more name: Brendan Fraser. Haggis thought he was much too youngfor the part, as did Fraser, but he agreed to do it. The movie was ɹnally green-lit, just four weeks before the shooting started. Only now, the ten milliondollars had shrunk to six and a half.For Haggis, everything was riding on this ɹlm. He mortgaged his house threetimes; he also used it as a set, in order to save on his location budget. Hecanceled many of the exterior scenes and borrowed the set of the televisionshow Monk to ɹlm interiors. He was eating carelessly and smoking constantly.He lost weight. He desperately needed more time.When he ɹnished shooting a scene in Chinatown, Cathy Schulman caught upwith him to ask about the next day’s shoot. “You look like you’re clutching yourchest,” she observed.Haggis admitted that he was having some pains.“Sharp pains?” Schulman urged him to see a doctor. He didn’t want to hearthat. He went home.He woke the next morning in agony. He called his doctor, who told him it wasprobably stress, but agreed to see him just to set his mind at ease. By now, Paulwas short of breath, so Deborah drove him to the doctor’s oɽce. The doctor dida few tests and said yes, it was stress and muscle fatigue. “But we’ll do anelectrocardiogram just in case.”A few moments later the doctor returned. His face was snow white. “Don’tstand up!” he said in a professionally measured voice. “You’ve had a heartattack!”That night in the hospital, Haggis suʃered another cardiac failure. He receivedthree stents in the arteries to his heart in an emergency operation. He was ableto watch the entire procedure on the monitor. It was really like an out-of-bodyexperience, watching his own fragile heart being repaired. The movie he wasmaking didn’t seem so important anymore.That changed as soon as the operation was over."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Schulman arrived with some more bad news. “I talked to your doctor,” shetold Haggis. “He’s not going to allow you to go back to work for another four orfive months. I’ve got to hire another director.”“Fine,” Haggis responded. He said he’d talk it over with his doctor.The doctor conɹrmed the decision. “Paul, it’s not just your heart attack,” hetold him. “You’ve had an operation. It’ll put too much stress on your heart.”“I totally understand,” Haggis replied. “Let me ask you how much stress youthink I would be experiencing if I were just sitting at home while anotherdirector is finishing my fucking film!”Production was shut down for a week and a half until Haggis returned, with anurse at his side who checked his vital signs every quarter hour. Sandra Bullockbrought him green tea and refused to let him drink coʃee. Every time Haggistried to stand up, she told him to sit down. She had a kind of implacablematernal authority. He ɹnished the ɹlm in his chair with a cup of tea in hishands.Clint Eastwood had been asked to read Million Dollar Baby for the role ofFrankie Dunn, the boxing coach. He loved the script, but said he would only dothe role if he could direct as well. Although Haggis hated to surrender theopportunity to direct, he knew it would be a bigger picture if Eastwood werebehind it. Hilary Swank was cast as Maggie Fitzgerald, a part that would bringher an Academy Award. Morgan Freeman also would win in a supporting role,and Eastwood for directing—all that in addition to winning the Oscar for BestPicture. Haggis would be nominated for Best Screenplay. But that was still onthe horizon.While he was still editing Crash, Haggis began writing another movie forEastwood, Flags of Our Fathers. They went to visit the producer of that project,Steven Spielberg, on the set of War of the Worlds, which he was shooting withTom Cruise. Spielberg had called Haggis to talk over an idea for another script.Haggis had met Cruise on a couple of occasions, once at a fund-raiser andagain at the Celebrity Centre. As the most popular and sought-after leading manin Hollywood, Cruise was given perks that few other stars could match. He hadasked Tommy Davis, now his full-time Scientology handler, to set up a tent onthe set of War of the Worlds in order to distribute church materials to the crewand provide Scientology assists. The precedent alarmed many in Hollywood, andSpielberg was widely criticized for letting it happen.“It’s really remarkable to me,” Spielberg observed, as he and Haggis walkedto his trailer. “I’ve met all these Scientologists, and they seem like the nicestpeople.”"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"“Yeah, we keep all the evil ones in the closet,” Haggis replied.3A couple of days later, Tommy Davis called Haggis at home and told himsomeone from senior management needed to see him urgently. Haggis had noidea what was going on. He assumed that the church was going to pressure himto take some more auditing or another course, as had happened so often in thepast. Davis met him at the Celebrity Centre and escorted him to a room whereGreg Wilhere was waiting. Wilhere, a handsome former college football player,was a senior executive in the church assigned to be Cruise’s personal auditor.(He accompanied the star even to the shooting of Days of Thunder, where acharacter in the movie was named after him.) Wilhere was livid because Haggishad upset Tom Cruise by subverting years of work on Cruise’s part to recruitSpielberg into the church.“It was a joke,” Haggis protested. He said he had no idea how that could haveundermined Cruise’s eʃorts to draw the most powerful man in Hollywood intoScientology. Wilhere said that Steven was having a problem with one of hisseven children, and Tom was working to “steer him in the right direction.” Allthat was ruined, Wilhere said, because Spielberg now believed there were evilScientologists who were locked in a closet.Haggis felt like he was trapped in a farce. It all seemed wildly ridiculous, buthe was the only one who thought so. Still, he’d be crazy to antagonize TomCruise and Steven Spielberg. He oʃered to explain to Spielberg that he had beenkidding, there were no evil Scientologists, and if there were, they wouldn’t bekept in a closet. He couldn’t believe that Spielberg would actually think he hadbeen serious.Wilhere was unappeased. He said Cruise was apoplectic. He directed Haggis towrite the star a letter of apology—this minute. Haggis dutifully wrote out a noteon the paper handed to him, but Wilhere said it wasn’t sufficient. Haggis wrote amore contrite note. Wilhere said he would pass it along. But Haggis never got aresponse from Cruise.4Haggis came away from that meeting with a new appreciation of thesigniɹcance of Tom Cruise to Scientology. He had heard that Cruise had oftenbeen enlisted to try to recruit famous people. They included James Packer, therichest man in Australia; David Beckham, the British soccer star, and his wife,Victoria, the former Spice Girl; and Cruise’s good friends, the actors Will andJada Pinkett Smith, who later funded a school that used Hubbard educationaltechniques. But there was no one else like Spielberg. Had Cruise been successfulin his eʃorts, it would have been a transformative moment in the history of thechurch, especially in its relation to Hollywood. It would have given reality to"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"the mythology of Scientology’s inɻuence in the entertainment industry. Whocould guess how many recruits would ɻood into the church because ofSpielberg’s imprimatur? Or how much money would pour into Scientology’scoʃers by moguls and agents and aspiring movie stars seeking to gain favor?The ambition behind such a play on the part of the church was breathtaking.And Haggis had stepped into the middle of it with an innocent jest.Cruise turned his attention to the other Scientologists in the industry. Manyhad gone quiet following the scandals in the church or had never openlyadmitted their aɽliation with the church. Cruise called a meeting of otherScientology celebrities and urged them to become more outspoken about theirreligion. The popular singer Beck, who had grown up in the church,subsequently began speaking openly about his faith. Erika Christensen, a risingyoung actress who was also a second-generation Scientologist, called Cruise herspiritual mentor.Inspired by a new sense of activism, a group of Scientology actors turnedagainst Milton Katselas, the gray eminence of the Beverly Hills Playhouse. Noone had been more instrumental in forging the bond between Scientology andHollywood. Katselas had been a longtime friend of Hubbard’s and still kept aphotograph of him on his desk. The two men were similar in many ways, butespecially in their transformative eʃect on those who studied under them.Humorous, compassionate, and charismatic, but also vain and demanding,Katselas was not above bullying his students to make a point; however, many ofthem felt that he had taken them to a higher level of artistry than they had everthought they could achieve. When Katselas addressed an acting student, it wasn’tjust about technique; his lessons were full of savvy observations about life andbehavior.One of those students, Allen Barton, was a classical pianist as well as apromising actor. When Katselas heard him play, he found him a teacher and paidfor his piano lessons. Barton eventually arranged a recital on a Sunday evening.Katselas showed up at the theater at eight that morning, just as the piano wasbeing delivered. He noticed that the stage was scratched, there were piled-upboxes spilling out of the wings, and a large spiral staircase—a prop from an oldproduction—was left on the stage, because it was simply too big to move.Barton explained that he was going to cover up as much as possible with blackdrapes. Katselas called his oɽce and within an hour ten people arrived. He sentBarton oʃ to relax and prepare himself for the performance. When Bartonreturned that afternoon, the staircase was gone, the boxes had disappeared, thestage had been sanded and painted, and four trees surrounded the piano. Even"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"the pots the trees were planted in had been painted to match the backdrop. Theoverall eʃect was stunning. “Have a good show,” Katselas said, and walkedaway. Overwhelmed, Barton ran after him. “How can I ever thank you?” heasked. As he drove off, Katselas said, “Learn to expect it of yourself.”Such stories became a part of the Katselas legend. He was an OT V and a verypublic Scientologist, but he had stopped moving up the Bridge, in part becausehe refused to travel to Flag, where the upper-level courses were oʃered.Moreover, he had gotten into Ethics trouble because of his behavior with someof his female students. Jenna Elfman was a leader of the revolt against Katselas.She had been one of his prize students, winning a Golden Globe Award in 1999for her free-spirited performance in the sitcom Dharma & Greg. Allen Barton,who had become a teacher at the Playhouse, wrote Elfman a letter in June2004, begging her to relent. He called the movement against Katselas“Scientological McCarthyism,” harking back to the blacklisting of Hollywoodcelebrities in the 1950s because of their supposed Communist sympathies. “AsScientologists, are we now a group that blacklists, that casts aside friendshipsand alliances on the basis of how fast someone is moving up the Bridge?” hewrote. “If we as a group are going to take on the billions of wogs out in theworld, how can we disconnect from each other?” Elfman never responded.After Cruise rallied the Scientology celebrities, a group of students demandedthat Katselas make the Playhouse a “WISE” business. The acronym stands forWorld Institute of Scientology Enterprises. Katselas refused, even though he losta hundred students in a mass Scientology walkout. Many of them went toanother school, the Acting Center, which was founded in 2006, based in part onScientology techniques. Katselas died of heart failure in 2008, and the BeverlyHills Playhouse is no longer connected with the church. The long line ofprotégés that Katselas left behind cemented the association between the churchand the Hollywood acting community, but in the end he was ostracized by thevery people whose careers he had nurtured.Tom Cruise was now considered the unoɽcial Ethics Oɽcer of Hollywood.He was the embodiment of Hubbard’s vision of a church with temples dedicatedto celebrity rather than God. Cruise’s intensity and commitment, along with hisspectacular ambition, matched Miscavige’s own. It was as if Miscavige hadrubbed a magic lantern and Cruise had appeared, a genie who could open anydoor. He was one of the few people that Miscavige saw as a peer. Miscavigeeven wondered if there was some way to appoint Cruise the church’s InspectorGeneral for Ethics—Rathbun’s job. “He’d say that Tom Cruise was the onlyperson in Scientology, other than himself, that he would trust to run the"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"church,” one former Sea Org member recalled. Rathbun observed: “Miscavigeconvinced Cruise that he and Tom were two of only a handful of truly ‘bigbeings’ on the planet. He instructed Cruise that LRH was relying upon them tounite with the few others of their ilk on earth to make it onto ‘Target Two’—some unspeciɹed galactic locale where they would meet up with Hubbard in theafterlife.”HAGGIS HAD ALSO BEEN folded into the celebrity recruitment apparatus. He had puthis money and his reputation in the hands of the church. He, too, was servingScientology. But he rarely spoke about his aɽliation to his employees orassociates. Even his close friends were surprised to learn that he was in thechurch. “He didn’t have that sort of straight-on, unambiguous, unambivalentview that so many Scientologists project into the world,” Marshall Herskovitzobserved.For years, Herskovitz and several of Haggis’s closest non-Scientology friendsparticipated in an irregular Friday get-together called Boys’ Night. They met atan Italian restaurant on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica. The actor Josh Brolinusually attended, along with director Oliver Stone, producer Stephen Nathan,and a peace activist and former priest named Blase Bonpane, among others. Onenight an attractive New York Times reporter came to write about the event, andthe men decided that she made them all a lot more appealing than they were onother occasions. After that, they voted to invite one woman to join themwhenever they met. Usually, it’s a beautiful actress. Julie Delpy and CharlizeTheron have both been accorded this honor. Madeleine Stowe recalled it as thefunniest evening she had ever had, although she had the sense to bring herhusband along. She remembered Haggis sitting back, wisecracking, smoking acigarette, watching it all happen.Although Brolin, Nathan, and Stone are three of Haggis’s closest male friends,they never talked to him about Scientology. And yet each of the three had anexperience in the church, which the others weren’t aware of. Steve Nathan hadbeen hooked up to an E-Meter in the late 1960s by some British Scientologistswho were looking for recruits, but he hadn’t been impressed. Oliver Stone didn’teven know Haggis was in Scientology. But for that matter, few knew that Stonehad also spent a month in the church. He was a young man just back fromVietnam, full of trouble and questions. He signed up at the church’s New Yorkcenter in the old Hotel Martinique. “It was like going to college and readingDale Carnegie, something you do to ɹnd yourself.” The diʃerence was that in"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Scientology there were nice parties and beautiful girls. Scientology didn’t answerhis questions; but on the other hand, he noted, “I got laid.”Brolin had known Haggis for many years. They had worked together intelevision, and Brolin had helped with Haggis’s charities. Brolin and his wife,actress Diane Lane, shared a house in Italy during the summers with Paul andDeborah. One evening, lubricated with grappa, Brolin began recounting a storyof a friend who had “inɹltrated” Scientology. He wondered why Paul andDeborah were listening stony-faced. When he ɹnished the tale, Deborah ɹnallysaid, “You know, we’re Scientologists.”“What?” Brolin exclaimed. “When the fuck did that happen?”“A long time ago,” Deborah said.“I am so sorry, I had no idea!” Brolin said.After that, Brolin went with Deborah to a couple of gatherings to hear aboutScientology’s opposition to psychotropic drugs. Although Brolin had never talkedabout it, he had gone to the Celebrity Centre himself, “in a moment of realdesperation,” and received spiritual counseling. He quickly decided Scientologywasn’t for him. But he still wondered what the religion did for celebrities likeTom Cruise and John Travolta: “Each has a good head on his shoulders, theymake great business decisions, they seem to have wonderful families. Is thatbecause they were helped by Scientology?”Brolin once witnessed Travolta giving a Scientology assist at a dinner party inLos Angeles. Marlon Brando arrived with a cut on his leg. He had been injuredwhile helping a stranded motorist on the Paciɹc Coast Highway pull his car outof a mudslide, and he was in pain. Travolta oʃered to help, saying that he hadjust reached a new level in Scientology, which gave him enhanced abilities.Brando said, “Well, John, if you have powers, then absolutely.” Travoltatouched Brando’s leg and they each closed their eyes. Brolin watched, thinking itwas bizarre and surprisingly physical. After ten minutes, Brando opened his eyesand said, “That really helped. I actually feel different!”IN 2003, Cruise continued working with Rathbun on his upper levels. While hewas at Gold Base, instead of staying in the cottage he had formerly shared withNicole Kidman, Cruise moved into the guesthouse of L. Ron Hubbard’sresidence, Bonnie View. One Sunday night, following a late-night meal inHubbard’s baronial dining room, Cruise got food poisoning. The culprit wasthought to be an appetizer of fried shrimp in an egg roll. The cook wassummarily sent to Happy Valley."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Rathbun accompanied Cruise to Flag Base in Clearwater where he couldperform the exercises required to attain OT VII. Because Miscavige depended onRathbun to handle so many of the church’s most sensitive problems, he had beenlulled into feeling a kind of immunity from the leader’s violent temper. InSeptember, he returned to Gold Base and gave a report to Miscavige aboutCruise’s progress.Miscavige asked where Cruise would be doing his semiannual checkups. “AtFlag,” Rathbun said. All OT VIIs do their checkups at Flag.“Who’s going to do it?”Rathbun named an auditor in Clearwater that he thought highly of.Miscavige turned to his wife and said, “Can you believe this SP?” He declaredthat unlike any other OT VII, Cruise would get his checkups at Gold Base.When Cruise duly arrived at Gold for his semiannual check, he was preparingfor his role as a contract killer in Collateral. Miscavige took him out to the gunrange and showed him how to shoot a .45-caliber pistol. Meanwhile, Rathbunadministered the star’s six-month checkup.Because of his insubordination, Rathbun had to go through a program ofpenitence. One of the steps was to write up a list of his oʃenses against thechurch, which Miscavige had sketched out for him. “I am writing this publicannouncement to inform executives and staʃ that I have come to my senses andI am no longer committing present time overts and have ceased all attacks andsuppressions on Scientology,” Rathbun admitted in September 2003, adoptingthe abject tone that characterizes many Scientology confessions. Speaking in full-blown Scientologese, he wrote, “The end result is unmocked org form,overworked and enturbulated executives and staʃ.” This meant that he had notthought out his intentions clearly, causing the church and the people whoworked for it to be in disarray. He had a particular apology to make to DavidMiscavige: “Each and every time on major situations, COB has had to interveneto clean up wars I had exacerbated.... The cumulative amount of COB’s time Ihave cost in terms of dropping balls, creating situations internally andexternally, is on the order of eight years.”Rathbun was shocked, not just by being declared an SP, but also by thechanges at Gold Base in the year and a half he had been posted to Flag. Allcommunications into and out of the base had been cut oʃ. The leader hadseveral of his top executives conɹned to the Watchdog Committee headquarters—a pair of double-wide trailers that had been married together. By the end ofthe year, the number who were living there under guard had grown to aboutforty or fifty people. It was now called the Hole. Except for one long conference"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"table, there was no furniture—no chairs or beds, just an expanse of outdoorcarpet—so the executives had to eat standing up and sleep on the ɻoor, whichwas swarming with ants. In the morning, they were marched outside for groupshowers with a hose, then back to the Hole. Their meals were brought to them—a slop of reheated leftovers. When temperatures in the desert locationmounted to more than a hundred degrees, Miscavige turned oʃ the electricity,letting the executives roast inside the locked quarters.The leader ordered them to stay until they ɹnally had rearranged the “OrgBoard”—the church’s organizational chart—to his satisfaction, which was nevergiven. Photographs of Sea Org personnel were continually moved from oneposition to another on the chart, which meant that people were constantly beingreassigned to diʃerent posts, whimsically, and no post was secure. About ninehundred positions needed to be ɹlled at Int and Gold Bases, and the stack ofpersonnel and ethics ɹles was ɹve feet high. This anarchic process had beengoing on more or less intensively for four years.At odd, unpredictable hours, often in the middle of the night, Miscavige wouldshow up in the Hole, accompanied by his wife, Shelly, and his Communicator,Laurisse Stuckenbrock, each of whom carried a tape recorder to take downwhatever Miscavige had to say. The detainees could hear the drumbeat of theshoes as Miscavige’s entourage marched toward the trailers. The leaderdemanded that the executives engage in what were termed “séances”—endlesshours of confessions about their crimes and failures, in this and previous lives,as well as whatever dark thoughts—“counter-intentions”—they might beharboring against him. If someone was not forthcoming with such confessions,the group would harass that person until he produced a confession. Sometimesthese were sexual fantasies. That would be written up in a report, whichMiscavige would then read aloud to other church officials.The entire base became paralyzed with anxiety about being thrown into theHole. People were trying desperately to police their thoughts, but it wasdiɽcult to keep secrets when staʃ members were constantly being security-checked with E-Meters. Even conɹdences whispered to a spouse were regularlybetrayed. After one of COB’s lengthy rants, recordings of his statement would besent to a steno pool, then transcripts were delivered to the executives in theHole, who had to read them aloud to each other repeatedly.Mike Rinder was in the Hole for two years, even though he continued to bethe church’s chief spokesperson. Bizarrely, he would sometimes be pulled outand ordered to conduct a press conference, or to put on a tuxedo and jet oʃ to aScientology gala; then he would be returned to conɹnement. He and other"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"executives were made to race around the room on their hands and bare knees,day after day, tearing open scabs on their knees and leaving permanent scars.Miscavige once directed De Vocht to rough up Rinder, because “he’s just an SP.”De Vocht took Rinder outside and gave him a going-over. But De Vocht was alsofrightened of Miscavige. He took to sleeping with a broken broom handle. Whenanother executive spoke up about the violence, he was beaten by two ofMiscavige’s assistants and made to mop the bathroom floor with his tongue.Mike Rinder, former chief spokesperson for the church, in Florida, 2012The detainees developed a particular expression whenever Miscavige came in,which he took note of. He called them “Pie Faces.” To illustrate what he meant,Miscavige drew a circle with two dots for eyes and a straight line for a mouth.He had T-shirts made up with the pie face on it. Rinder was “the Father of PieFaces.” People didn’t know how to react. They didn’t want to call attention tothemselves, but they also didn’t want to be a Pie Face.In Scientology, there is a phrase that explains mob psychology: Contagion ofAberration, meaning that groups of people can stimulate each other to do thingsthat are insane. According to former church executives, one day Miscavigearrived at the Hole and demanded that Marc Yager, the Commanding Oɽcer ofthe Commodore’s Messengers Org, and Guillaume Lesevre, the ExecutiveDirector of the Church of Scientology International, confess that they werehomosexual lovers. He threatened that Tom Cruise would come to “punch you"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"guys out” if the other Sea Org members in the Hole failed to get a confessionfrom the two men. The captive executives took this threat seriously. WhenMiscavige left, a group of women executives who had been appointed as leadersof the detainees urged some of the bigger men in the Hole to “give some peoplesome black eyes before Tom has to.” Several men dutifully beat up Lesevre andYager. Then one of the women reported to Miscavige that the men hadconfessed that they were gay lovers. When Debbie Cook, the former Captain ofFlag Service Org and one of the most respected executives in the church, saidthat wasn’t true, she was declared a traitor. She was made to stand in a garbagecan for twelve hours, as the other detainees demanded that she confess her own“homosexual tendencies.” The women in the room repeatedly slapped her andpoured water over her head. A sign was hung around her neck, saying LESBO.Rathbun was seen as being COB’s chief enforcer. During meetings in the Holeor elsewhere on the base, he would stand to one side and glare at his colleagueswhile he says Miscavige berated and abused them. Although he was physicallyintimidating, Rathbun was suʃering from a number of physical ailments,including a bad back, gallstones, calcium deposits in his neck, and painfulvaricose veins, which he believed came from having to stand at attention forhours on end. He, too, was prone to bursts of sudden violence. “Once on aphone call I saw him get so mad that he put his ɹst right through a computerscreen,” his former wife recalled. Miscavige would send him down to observewhat was going on in the Hole and come back with reports. In January 2004,when Rinder was accused of withholding a confession from the group, Rathbuntook him outside and beat him up. Rathbun says Miscavige wasn’t satisɹed. Hecalled Rathbun into his massive office in the Religious Technology Center, a coldand imposing room with steel walls and eighteen-foot ceilings, and accused himof letting Rinder “get away with murder.” Then, according to Rathbun, out ofnowhere, Miscavige grabbed him by the throat and slammed his head againstthe steel wall.5 Rathbun blacked out for a moment. He wasn’t hurt, but theterms had changed.A few days later, Rathbun found himself in the Hole, along with the entireInternational Management team and other executives. Miscavige said they weregoing to stay there until they got the Org Board done.Scientologists are trained to believe that whatever happens to them issomehow their fault, so much of the discussion in the Hole centered on whatthey had done to deserve this fate. The possibility that the leader of the churchmight be irrational or even insane was so taboo that no one could even think it,much less voice it aloud. Most of the people in the Hole had a strong allegiance"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"to the group—Scientology and the Sea Org—and they didn’t want to let theircomrades down. Many had been in the Sea Org their entire adult lives andportions of their childhood. Mike Rinder joined the Sea Org when he waseighteen. Amy Scobee was sixteen. Tom De Vocht was thirteen. They hadalready surrendered the possibility of ordinary family life. Sex outside ofmarriage was taboo, so many members married in their teens; but since 1986,children have been forbidden to Sea Org members. Former church executivessay that abortions were common and forcefully encouraged. Claire Headleymarried Marc when she was seventeen; by the time she was twenty-one she hadbeen pushed to have two abortions. She estimates that sixty to eighty percent ofthe women on Gold Base have had abortions. “It’s a constant practice,” shesaid.6Worried about pillow talk, Miscavige instituted a policy of imposed divorcesin 2004; people in the Religious Technology Center, the Commodore’sMessenger Organization, and Golden Era Productions could not be married tomembers in other divisions. For many of those people in the Hole, everyonethey knew or cared about was in the church. The cost of leaving—emotionallyand spiritually, as well as ɹnancially—was forbidding. And they knew if theytried to run away, they’d likely be found and punished.Those who attempted to leave the Sea Org through the formal process of“routing out” would be presented with a freeloader tab for all the courseworkand counseling they had received over the years. Claire and Marc Headley, forinstance, were billed more than $150,000 when they left and told they wouldhave to pay if they ever wanted to see their family again. Those who accept thisoʃer can spend years paying oʃ their debt. Those who don’t stand to lose anyconnection to their friends and family who remain in Scientology.Many had long since turned their back on friends and family who were not inthe church, and the prospect of facing them again brought up feelings of shame.The thought of leaving loved ones still in the church was even more fraught. Allof these conɻicting emotions were informed by the Scientology theory that lifegoes on and on, and that the mission of the church is to clear the planet, so inthe scheme of things the misery one might be suʃering now is temporary andnegligible. There is a larger goal. One is always working for “the greatest goodfor the greatest number of dynamics,” as Scientology ethics prescribed. And sothe executives of the church who had given their lives to the Sea Org directedtheir confusion and their anger inward, or toward their helpless colleagues.Rinder was an inevitable target. He was seen as being arrogant and above itall. Few people other than Rathbun really understood Rinder’s job; unlike the"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"others, the two men were often oʃ the base, dealing with lawyers, thegovernment, and the press. No doubt there was resentment at work as well. Thenext time the Sea Org executives turned on Rinder, Rathbun exploded. Hecaught his friend in a headlock and slammed him to the ground, then sat astridehim, pounding his head into the ɻoor and shouting at him, nose to nose. Rindermanaged to whisper, “Marty, I don’t want to play this game anymore.”Suddenly, Rathbun froze. Words had been spoken that broke the spell. But itwas only a moment.One evening about eight o’clock, Miscavige arrived, with his wife and hisCommunicator, Shelly and Laurisse, ɻanking him as usual with tape recorders intheir hands. He ordered that the conference table be taken away and chairs bebrought in for everyone in the Hole—about seventy people at the time,including many of the most senior people in the Sea Org. He asked if anyoneknew what “musical chairs” meant. In Scientology, it refers to frequent changesof post. About ɹve hundred people had been moved oʃ their jobs in the last ɹveyears, creating anarchy in the management structure. But that wasn’t the pointhe was trying to make. Finally, someone suggested that it was also a game.Miscavige had him explain the rules: Chairs are arranged in a circle and then, asthe players march around them, one chair is removed. When the music stops,everybody grabs a seat. The one left standing is eliminated. Then the musicstarts again. Miscavige explained that in this game the last person to grab a chairwould be the only one allowed to stay on the base; everyone else was to be“oʀoaded”—kicked out of the Sea Org—or sent away to the least desirableScientology bases around the world. Those whose spouses were not in the Holewould be forced to divorce.While Queen’s Greatest Hits played on a boom box, the church executivesmarched around and around, then fought for a seat when the music stopped. Asthe number of chairs diminished, the game got more physical. The executivesshoved and punched each other; clothes were torn; a chair was ripped apart. Allthis time, the biting lyrics of “Bohemian Rhapsody” ɻoated over the saccharinemelody:Is this the real life?Is this just a fantasy?Caught in a landslideNo escape from reality."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Rathbun, with his bad back, was eliminated fairly quickly. Rinder, De Vocht,Marc Headley—one by one, they found themselves standing alone, behind lowcubicle walls, watching the surviving contestants desperately ɹghting to remainin the Hole rather than be sent oʃ to God knows where. There was a clock overthe door marking the hours that passed as the music played on and on thensuddenly stopped and the riot began again. As people fell out of the game, COBhad airline tickets for distant locations printed up for them at the base’s traveloɽce. There were U-Haul trucks waiting outside to haul away their belongings.“Is it real to you now?” Miscavige teased. They were told that buses would beready to leave at six in the morning. Many were in tears. “I don’t see anybodyweeping for me,” Miscavige said. The utter powerlessness of everyone else inthe room was made nakedly clear to them. The game continued until 4 a.m.,when a woman named Lisa Schroer grabbed the final chair.The next morning the whole event was forgotten. No one went anywhere.In several legal declarations he has made over the years, Miscavige hasprotested, “I am the ecclesiastical leader of the religion, not the Church.” Thedistinction is important when the church is dragged into lawsuits or threatenedwith criminal liability; Miscavige can point to a chart that assigns organizationalresponsibility to other departments, whereas the sole responsibility of theReligious Technology Center, which he heads, is to protect Scientology doctrineand literature. And yet, Miscavige freely consigned those other departmentheads to the Hole or sent them to RPF. During the period that the organizationalchart was being constantly rearranged, the only reliable posting on the base washis, that of COB RTC; everyone else was constantly being uprooted and repottedin other temporary assignments. There is really only one person in charge of theChurch of Scientology.A few days after the musical chairs episode, Miscavige ordered everyone inthe Hole to report to Golden Era Productions to stuʃ CDs into cases. At onepoint, he began sharply interrogating De Vocht, who was shaken and stuttered inresponse. According to De Vocht, Miscavige punched him in the face. He felt hishead vibrate. He tried to turn away from the next blow, but Miscavige grabbedhis neck and shoved him into the ɻoor, pummeling and kicking him.7 De Vochthad served Miscavige for years, and had even considered him a friend. He haddedicated his life to Scientology and had been in the Sea Org for nearly thirtyyears. He recalls thinking, “Now here I am, being beat up by the top dog in frontof my peers.”After the attack, Miscavige continued his speech. De Vocht was so humiliatedthat he couldn’t bring himself to look at his companions. Finally, he managed a"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"glance at them. Pie faces.Rathbun was there, and at that moment he made a decision. As the otherexecutives were being led back to the Hole, he slipped away and got hismotorcycle and hid in the bushes. When a car ɹnally approached, he racedthrough the open gate into the outside world.1 The church denies that Cruise was videotaped, or that Miscavige watched such tapes, or used suchinformation to manipulate anyone. Noriyuki Matsumaru, who worked in the RTC with Miscavige, conɹrmsDe Vocht’s account.2 Cruise, through his lawyer, denies this exchange and says he has no political ambition.3 Spielberg’s publicist says that the director doesn’t recall the conversation.4 Tom Cruise’s lawyer says that the actor doesn’t remember the incident or his being upset with Haggis.5 As previously noted, the church denies all allegations of abuse by Miscavige.6 The church denies that anyone in the Sea Org has ever been pressured to have an abortion.7 The church denies that Miscavige has ever abused members of the church."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"G9TC and COBreat fame also imposes a kind of cloister on those who join its ranks.Tom Cruise had been a movie star since he was twenty-one, with twopopular movies in the same year, The Outsiders and Risky Business. By agetwenty-ɹve, he was the biggest star in Hollywood, on his way to becoming oneof the most famous movie legends in history. At the same age, Miscavige hadbecome the de facto leader of Scientology. Each of these men assumedextraordinary responsibilities when their peers were barely beginning theircareers. Their youth and position set them apart. So it was natural that two suchpowerful, isolated men would see themselves mirrored in each other.A number of Sea Org members who observed Cruise when he came to GoldBase remarked that he seemed liberated to be in an environment where no onehassled him, or took his photograph, or asked for autographs. There are cottagesbuilt for the use of other well-known Scientologists, such as John Travolta,Kirstie Alley, Edgar Winter, and Priscilla Presley, so the base can sometimes feellike a secret celebrity spa. Once, Miscavige had the entire Gold Base crew lineup at the gate and salute Cruise when he arrived. Cruise must have felt self-conscious about this display, because it happened only once. People on the basehave been directed not to speak to Cruise at all, unless spoken to. In this way,Cruise tastes the life that Miscavige has lived for decades, one of seclusion anddeference, concentrated on spiritual advancement.1Similarly, after becoming associated with Cruise, the style of Miscavige’s lifebegan to reɻect that of a fantastically wealthy and leisured movie star. Henormally awakens at noon, with a cup of coʃee and a Camel cigarette. Thecoʃee is fresh-ground Starbucks, preferably a Guatemala or Arabian MochaJava, made with distilled water, to which he adds raw sugar and half-and-half.Then he takes breakfast, the first of his five meals.According to Miscavige’s former chef, Sinar Parman, the church leader waseating “three squares and a snack at night,” until the late nineties. One day,while on a Delta ɻight from LA to Clearwater, Miscavige walked to the cabinfrom his seat in ɹrst class and showed some photos from a muscle magazine toParman and his steward, who traveled with him. He told them he wanted to"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"“get ripped and have six-pack abs.” After the ɻight, Miscavige changed physicaltrainers and began taking bodybuilding supplements. He also adopted a strictdiet that requires each meal to be at least forty percent protein and to containno more than four hundred calories. Soon, he was looking like the men in themuscle magazines.To maintain his physique, Miscavige’s chefs have to enter each portion sizeinto a computer, including the cream in his morning coʃee. Miscavige oftenstarts with an omelet of one whole egg and ɹve egg whites. Two and a halfhours later, lunch is provided. Two choices would be prepared daily, for bothhim and his wife—four meals altogether. Miscavige prefers pizza, soup, andsubmarine sandwiches. Throughout the day cigarettes, bottled water, andprotein bars are stationed wherever he might be working. Dinner is a five-coursemeal, and once again, dual entrées are prepared for him to choose from.Miscavige’s favorite foods include wild mushroom risotto, linguine in whiteclam sauce, and pâté de foie gras. Fresh fruit and vegetables are purchased fromlocal markets or shipped in from overseas. Several times a week, a truck fromSanta Monica Seafood brings Atlantic salmon, or live lobster, ɻown in freshfrom the East Coast or Canada. Corn-fed lamb arrives from New Zealand. Whenguests such as Tom Cruise come to dinner, the kitchen goes into extravagantbursts of invention, with ingredients sometimes ɻown in from diʃerentcontinents. Two hours after dinner, the ɹrst evening snack arrives, with lighteroʃerings, such as Italian white bean soup or clam chowder. After midnight,there is a ɹnal late-night snack—a selection of nonfat cheeses, an apple crisp, orblueberry crepes, often garnished with edible ɻowers. Shelly usually preferred afruit platter. She would drink only almond milk, which was made on-site fromorganic almonds. She insisted that all the food be consistent with the dietrecommended for their blood type (both Shelly and David are type O). Two full-time chefs work all day preparing these meals, with several full-time stewardsto serve them.According to Claire Headley, who oversaw the ɹnances for the ReligiousTechnology Center between 2000 and 2004, the food costs for David and Shellyand their guests would range between $3,000 to as much as $20,000 per week.At the end of the evening, Miscavige retires to his den and drinks MacallanScotch and plays backgammon with members of his entourage, or listens tomusic on his $150,000 stereo system (he loves Michael Jackson), or watchesmovies in his private screening room (his favorite ɹlms are Scarface and theGodfather trilogy). He usually turns in around three or four in the morning.Miscavige enjoys shooting pool or playing video games in his lounge. He has a"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"tanning bed, and a high-end gym that few people other than Cruise arepermitted to use. Although he is short in stature, Miscavige exudes physicalpower. He favors tight-ɹtting T-shirts that show oʃ his chiseled biceps. Hecollects guns, maintains at least six motorcycles, and has a number ofautomobiles, including an armor-plated GMC Safari van with bulletproofwindows and satellite television, and a souped-up Saleen Mustang that Cruisegave him to match his own. His uniforms and business suits are fashioned byRichard Lim, a Los Angeles tailor whose clients include Cruise, Will Smith, andMartin Sheen. Miscavige’s shoes are custom-made in London by John Lobb,bootmaker to the royal family. His wardrobe ɹlls an entire room. Two full-timestewards are responsible for his cleaning and laundry. Cruise admired thehousecleaning so much—even Miscavige’s lightbulbs are polished once a month—that the church leader sent a Sea Org team to Cruise’s Telluride retreat totrain the star’s staff.Until 2007, when he traveled, Miscavige would often rent Cruise’s Gulfstreamjet, but he has since upgraded to a roomier Boeing business jet, at a cost ofthirty to ɹfty thousand dollars per trip. He brings along his personal hairdresserand chiropractor. He loves underwater photography, and when he returns fromhis annual trip on the Freewinds, he has the photography staff put the photos intoslides so they can be appreciated by the entire Gold Base staff.The contrast with the other Sea Org members is stark. They eat in a mess hall,which features a meat-and-potatoes diet and a salad bar, except for occasionalextended periods of rice and beans for those who are being punished. Theaverage cost per meal as of 2005 (according to Marc Headley, who participatedin the ɹnancial planning each week) was about seventy-ɹve cents a head—signiɹcantly less than what is spent per inmate in the California prison system.When members join the Sea Org, they are issued two sets of pants, two shirts,and a pair of shoes, which is their lifetime clothing allotment; anything else,they purchase themselves. Although the nominal pay for Sea Org members isɹfty dollars a week, many are ɹned for various infractions, so it’s not unusual tobe paid as little as thirteen or fourteen dollars. Married couples at Gold Baseshare a two-bedroom apartment with two other couples, meaning that one pairsleeps on the couch. In any case, few get more than ɹve or six hours of sleep anight. There are lavish exercise facilities at the base—an Olympic pool, a golfcourse, basketball courts—but they are rarely used. Few are permitted to haveaccess to computers. Every personal phone call is listened to; every letter isinspected. Bank records are opened and records kept of how much moneypeople have. Cultural touchstones common to most Americans are often lost on"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Sea Org members at Gold Base. They may not know the name of the presidentof the United States or be able to tell the diʃerence between the Republican andDemocratic parties. It’s not as if there is no access to outside information; thereis a big-screen television in the dining hall, and people can listen to the radio orsubscribe to newspapers and magazines; however, news from the outside worldbegins to lose its relevance when people are outside of the wider society forextended periods of time. Many Sea Org members have not left the base for adecade.On April 30 of each year, Scientology staʃ from around the world are pressedto contribute to Miscavige’s birthday present. One year, as birthday assessmentswere being passed around, few could contribute because they hadn’t been paidfor months. Finally, staʃers got their back pay so that they could make theirdonations. Janela Webster, who worked directly under Miscavige for ɹfteenyears, received $325, out of which she paid $150 for Miscavige’s gift. Suchpresents include tailored suits and leather jackets, high-end cameras, divingequipment, Italian shoes, and a handmade titanium bicycle. One year FlagService Org in Clearwater gave him a Vyrus 985 C3 4V, a motorcycle with aretail price of $70,000.2 Another division presented him with a BMW.Miscavige keeps a number of dogs, including ɹve beagles. He had blue vestsmade up for each of them, with four stripes on the shoulder epaulets, indicatingthe rank of Sea Org Captain. He insists that people salute the dogs as theyparade by. The dogs have a mini-treadmill where they work out. A full-timestaʃ member feeds, walks, and trains the dogs, takes them to the veterinarian,and enters one of them, Jelly, into contests, where he has attained championshipstatus. Another of Miscavige’s favorites, a Dalmatian–pit bull mix named Buster,went on a rampage one day and killed ten peacocks on the property, thenproudly laid them out for all to see. Buster has also attacked various members ofthe staʃ, sending one elderly woman to the emergency room and earning Busterhis own Ethics folder. Miscavige eventually had the dog taken away to anotherSea Org base, even though he believed that Buster had a nose for “out ethics”behavior. The relieved staʃ members joked that Buster had been sent to DogRPF.From an early age, Miscavige had taken control of his family. His father, RonSenior, joined the Sea Org following a charge of attempted rape lodged againsthim in 1985. Former church members say that signiɹcant church resources wereused to contain the scandal, and that David forced his father to join the Sea Org.Because David’s mother, Loretta, refused to sign up for that, she and Ron agreedto divorce. She continued in Scientology, rising to the summit as an OT VIII. She"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"worked as an accountant for the law ɹrm of Greta Van Susteren, the televisioncommentator, and her husband, John Coale, both Scientologists, who maintain amansion on Clearwater Beach. Loretta was a heavy smoker who suʃered fromemphysema and obesity—scarcely the image of an Operating Thetan—but herself-deprecating, sometimes goofy sense of humor made her popular among thestaʃ and upper-level Scientologists—“the court jester of the Scientology countryclub,” as Rathbun called her. Loretta’s regal position as the leader’s motherallowed her to give rein to gossipy stories about Dave’s childhood, which shetold in a thick Philly accent. Miscavige complained that his mother was trying todestroy him. He ordered Rathbun to run a security check on her, using the E-Meter. When Loretta realized what he was up to, she burst out laughing.Miscavige sent his personal trainer to help his mother get in shape, and he hadchurch members monitoring her diet, but her chronic health problems overtookher. “She was sick for a long time,” her granddaughter, Jenna Miscavige Hill,recalled. “She was not happy with the turn the church took.” Sometimes Lorettawould burst into tears. “I would try to help her the only way I knew how,” Hillsaid. “She was an amazing grandma.” (Loretta Miscavige died in 2005.)THE LEVEL OF ABUSE at the Gold Base was increasing year by year as—unpoliced byoutside forces—other senior executives began emulating their leader. Rinder, DeVocht, and Rathbun all admit to striking other staʃ members. Even some of thewomen became physically aggressive, slapping underlings when they didn’tperform up to standard. Debbie Cook, the former leader of Flag Base, says thatalthough Miscavige never struck her, he ordered his Communicator to do so.Another time, she said, he told his Communicator to break Cook’s ɹnger. Shebent Cook’s finger but failed to actually break it.Miscavige can be charming and kind, especially to Sea Org members who needemotional or medical assistance. He has a glittering smile and a commandingvoice. And yet former Scientologists who were close to him recall that hisconstant profanity and bursts of unprovoked violence kept everyone oʃ balance.Jeʃerson Hawkins, a former Sea Org executive who had worked with PaulHaggis on the rejected Dianetics campaign, says he was beaten by Miscavige onɹve occasions, the ɹrst time in 2002. He had just written an infomercial for thechurch. Miscavige summoned him to a meeting, where about forty memberswere seated on one side of a long conference table; Miscavige routinely sits byhimself on the other side. He began a tirade about the shortcomings of theinfomercial. When Hawkins started to respond, Miscavige cut him short. “The"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"only thing I want to hear from you is your crimes,” Miscavige said, meaning thatHawkins was to confess his subversive intentions. Then, without warning,Miscavige jumped on the table and launched himself at Hawkins, knocking himagainst a cubicle wall and battering him in the face. The two men fell to thefloor, and their legs became entangled. “Let go of my legs!” Miscavige shouted.Miscavige extricated himself and left the room, leaving Hawkins on the ɻoor,shocked, bruised, disheveled, humiliated, and staring at the forty people whodid nothing to support him. “Get up! Get up!” they told him. “Don’t make himwrong.”Even if he had had access to a phone, Hawkins wouldn’t have called thepolice. If a Sea Org member were to seek outside help, he would be punished,either by being declared a Suppressive Person or by being sent oʃ to do manuallabor for months or years. Far more important, Hawkins believed, was the factthat his spiritual immortality was on the line. Scientology had made him awareof his eternal nature as he moved from life to life, erasing his fear of mortality.Without that, he would be doomed to dying over and over again, “in ignoranceand darkness,” he said, “never knowing my true nature as a spirit.” Miscavige,he concluded, “holds the power of eternal life and death over you.”The church provided an aɽdavit of a former Sea Org member, YaelLustgarten, who stated that she was present at the meeting and that the attackby Miscavige never happened. She claims that Hawkins made a mess of hispresentation—“He smelled of body odor, he was unshaven, his voice tone wasvery low and he could hardly be heard”—and he was merely instructed to shapeup. On the other hand, Amy Scobee said she witnessed the attack—it was hercubicle the two men fell into—and after the altercation, she recalled, “I gatheredall the buttons from Jeʃ’s shirt and the change from his pockets and gave themback to him.”Tommy Davis later testiɹed that he had conducted an investigation of thecharges of abuse at the base. He said that all of the abuse had been committedby Rinder, Rathbun, and De Vocht—none by Miscavige.TOM DE VOCHT GREW UP in a little central Florida town called Fort Meade. When hewas ten years old, in 1974, his cousin, Dicky Thompson, a keyboardist in theSteve Miller Band, came to visit, riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Thatyear the band had a number one song, “The Joker,” and Thompson rode intotown with a glow of fame around him. “He had a weird stare,” De Vochtremembered. “He invited my sister to meet Steve Miller and John Travolta.”"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Within a year, most of De Vocht’s family had joined the Church of Scientology.In July 1977, thirteen-year-old Tom De Vocht signed the billion-year contractfor the Sea Org.De Vocht became one of Miscavige’s allies and moved up the bureaucraticladder quickly. In 1986, he was appointed the Commanding Oɽcer of theCommodore’s Messengers Org at Flag. In 2001, Miscavige called him,complaining, “Tom, I can’t get my building done.” The new headquarters for theReligious Technology Center at Gold Base, Building 50, was years behindschedule and well over budget. Miscavige directed De Vocht to come to GoldBase and oversee the construction. The ɹrst day he got there, De Vocht realizedthat “this building is going to be the end of me.”Forty-seven million dollars—more than a thousand dollars per square foot—had previously been spent on the new center. The building had already beencompleted a couple of times, using the highest-grade materials—cold rolledsteel, and anigre, a beautiful but extremely hard, pinkish African wood—only tohave components ripped out because they didn’t meet Miscavige’s standards.Miscavige’s desk, also made of steel, was so heavy that De Vocht worriedwhether the structure would support it. He discovered that there were no actualarchitectural drawings for the building; there were only renderings of what itshould look like. The stucco exterior walls were already cracked because thewhole ediɹce was at a 1.25-inch tilt. The walls weren’t actually connected to theɻoors. Even a minor earthquake (Gold Base was just west of the San AndreasFault) might cause the whole building to collapse. De Vocht recommended thatthe building be torn down and rebuilt from scratch, but Miscavige rejected thatidea.The expense of essentially rebuilding a poorly constructed building from theinside was immense. When De Vocht had almost ɹnished construction, havingspent an additional $60 million, Miscavige still had a list of complaints. He wasalso critical of the landscaping. Gold Base is in a desert, but Miscavigedemanded that the building appear to be set in a forest.One morning, De Vocht says, Miscavige and his wife were inspecting the largevault in the legal department of Building 50, when the leader stopped in histracks and began rubbing his head. He turned pale. “Where did we put the goldbullion?” he asked his wife. For a full minute, Miscavige kept rubbing his headand asking about the gold, but then he snapped out of it and went on as ifnothing had happened. De Vocht recalls that forty-ɹve minutes later, ShellyMiscavige called him and asked him, “What are we going to do? He’s losing it.”She told him that Dave had gone “Type 3”—psychotic—because of all the"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Suppressive Persons at the base.3While De Vocht was working on Building 50, he was forced to attend a séancewith ɹve hundred other Sea Org members on Gold Base. People were called outby name and asked, “What crimes have you committed against DavidMiscavige?” One after another, people approached the microphone andconfessed to ways in which they were suppressing the dissemination ofScientology or thinking taboo thoughts. De Vocht was disgusted by the orgy ofself-abasement. One night, he simply took over the meeting and brought somesemblance of order to it. That night, Shelly Miscavige asked him to be theCommanding Oɽcer of the Commodore’s Messengers Org, which essentially puthim in charge of the entire base. “It’s out of control,” she pleaded, saying thather husband counted on him and had no one else to turn to.In 2004, De Vocht ɹnished reconstructing the 45,000-square-foot Building 50,which wound up costing $70 million. “You’re the biggest spender in the historyof Scientology,” Miscavige told him. “You should be shot.”EVEN THOUGH MEMBERSHIP in the church has been declining for years, according topolls and census ɹgures, money continues to pour into Scientology coʃers infantastic sums. Donors are accorded higher status depending on the size of theirgifts to the International Association of Scientologists—Patron Maximus for a$25 million pledge, for instance. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson,became a Patron Laureate for her $10 million gift to the association in 2007.The IAS now holds more than $1 billion, mostly in oʃshore accounts, accordingto former executives of the church. Scientology coursework alone can be verypricey—as much as $400,000 to reach the level of OT VIII. That doesn’t countthe books and materials or the latest-model E-Meter, which is priced at $4,650.Then there is the auditing, which ranges in price from $5,000 to $8,000 for atwelve-hour “intensive,” depending on the location and the level of the auditor.Services sold in Clearwater alone amount to $100 million a year.Despite the frequent cost overruns on construction, Scientology undertook aworldwide building campaign, kicked oʃ by Miscavige’s decision to use theoccasion of 9/11 to issue a call for a massive expansion of the church. “Bluntly,we are the only people of Earth who can reverse the decline,” he announced.“The way to do better is to get big.”In some cases, the building projects have become signiɹcant moneymakers forthe church. Across the street from Scientology’s Fort Harrison Hotel inClearwater is the Super Power Building, intended to be a training facility to"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"enhance the perceptions of upper-level thetans. The fund-raising kicked oʃ witha $1 million gift from the Feshbach brothers. Despite years-long constructiondelays and ɹnes imposed by the City of Clearwater, the 380,000-square-footSuper Power Building has proven to be a bonanza for the church, which hastaken in at least $145 million in donations to complete the project—$120million more than it was projected to cost when ɹrst proposed, in 1993. Thechurch explains that the plan has been enlarged from its original goals, whichhas created delays and additional expenses. Tom De Vocht, who worked on theconstruction for years, said that the building remained unɹnished for so longbecause no one knew what super power was.Under Miscavige’s leadership, the church has aggressively launched a programcalled Ideal Orgs, which aim to replicate the grandeur of Hubbard’s Saint HillManor. A number of the Ideal Orgs have been shuttered—including Seattle,Boston, and New Haven—because the local Scientology communities wereunable to support them. Other notable churches and missions are now boardedup or unloaded—including one in Santa Monica that Paul and Deborah Haggisraised money to establish.THE INTENSITY OF the pressure on Sea Org members to raise money for the church—while working for next to nothing—can be understood in part through theaccount of Daniel Montalvo. His parents joined the Sea Org when he was ɹve,and the very next year he signed his own billion-year contract. He says that hebegan working full-time in the organization when he was eleven and recalls that,along with other Sea Org members, including children, his days stretched fromeight in the morning until eleven thirty at night. Part of his work was shovelingup asbestos that had been removed during the renovation of the Fort HarrisonHotel. He says no protective gear was provided, not even a mask. He rarely sawhis parents. While he was at Flag Base in 2005, when he was fourteen, heguarded the door while Tom Cruise was in session. The sight of childrenworking at a Sea Org facility would not have been unusual. They were separatedfrom their parents and out of school. According to Florida child labor laws,minors who are fourteen and ɹfteen years old are prohibited from workingduring school hours, and may work only up to ɹfteen hours a week. Daniel saidthat he was allowed schooling only one day a week, on Saturday.When Daniel was ɹfteen, he was assigned to work on the renovation ofScientology’s publications building in Los Angeles, operating scissors lifts andother heavy equipment. According to California child labor laws, ɹfteen-year-"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"old children are allowed to work only three hours per day outside of school,except on weekends—no more than eighteen hours per week total. Sixteen is theminimum age for children to work in any manufacturing establishment usingpower-driven hoisting apparatus, such as the scissors lift. Daniel graduated towork at the church’s auditing complex nearby, called the American Saint HillOrganization; then from six in the evening until three in the morning hevolunteered at Bridge Publications. He was paid thirty-six dollars a week.Daniel’s work at Bridge Publications was suɽciently impressive that he wasposted full-time in the manufacturing division there the following year. Thechurch had issued a new edition of Hubbard’s books and lectures called TheBasics, which was being aggressively marketed to Scientologists. One of Daniel’sjobs was to cut the “thumb notches” that mark the glossary and the appendix inthese handsomely made books, like the notches one would ɹnd in an unabridgeddictionary. A machine with a guillotine steel blade slices through the pages toproduce the half-moon indentation. California law speciɹcally forbids theoperation of the machine by anyone under the age of eighteen. Daniel notedabout twenty other minors working at the plant, all of them sleep deprived andworking around heavy equipment. One night Daniel chopped oʃ his right indexɹnger on the notching machine. A security oɽcer picked up his ɹnger and put itin a plastic bag with ice, then took Daniel to the children’s hospital inHollywood. He was instructed to tell the admitting nurse that he had injuredhimself in a skateboarding accident. The doctors were unable to reattach hisfinger.After that, Daniel was sent to the sales division of Bridge Publications. Saleshad been declining since The Basics had ɹrst been published in 2007. The Basicsincluded eighteen books and a number of Hubbard lectures on CD; the completepackage cost $6,500. Sea Orgs all over the world had call centers set up to sellthem. In Los Angeles, there were hourly quotas to be met, and those who failedsuʃered various punishments, such as having water dumped on their head orbeing made to do push-ups or run up and down the stairs. There were securityguards on every ɻoor. A salesperson had to get a slip verifying that he had madehis quota before he was permitted to go to bed.Often it was simply impossible to make the quota legitimately, so people ranunauthorized credit cards. Members of the Sea Org sales force would break intothe church’s ɹnancial records and pull up the credit card information of publicmembers. Members who had money on account at the church for future courseswould see it drained to pay for books they didn’t order. Parishioners who balkedat making contributions or buying unwanted materials were told they were in"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"violation of church ethics, and their progress in Scientology was blocked orthreatened.Members who pledge more than they can aʃord can ɹnd themselves in acompromised situation. One Scientologist who was a bank teller says he wastold to comply with a robbery in order to pay oʃ his debt to the church; therobbers took four thousand dollars. In 2009, Nancy Cartwright’s ɹancé, StephenE. Brackett, a contractor, had taken a substantial construction advance torenovate a restaurant. The company that insured the project later suedCartwright, claiming that she and Brackett had diverted the money to theChurch of Scientology. Brackett, an OT V, had been featured in a church ad forthe Super Power Building, identiɹed as a “key contributor.” “Mankind needsyour help,” Brackett was quoted as saying in the ad. He later took his life byjumping off a bridge on Pacific Coast Highway near Big Sur.4The biggest ɹnancial scandal involving church members was a Ponzi schemeoperated by Reed Slatkin; he was one of the co-founders, with Paul Haggis’sfriend Sky Dayton, of EarthLink. Slatkin’s massive fraud involved more than halfa billion dollars in investments; much of the initial “proɹt” was returned toScientology investors, such as Daniel and Myrna Jacobs, who earned nearly $3million on a $760,500 “investment.” According to Marty Rathbun, Slatkin’sScientology investors included Anne Archer and Fox News commentator GretaVan Susteren. Later investors were not so lucky. Slatkin was convicted ofdefrauding $240 million; it is still not known how much of that money wentdirectly to the church, although the court found that about $50 million wasfunneled to the church indirectly by investors with massive gains. In 2006,groups aɽliated with the Church of Scientology, including the Celebrity Centre,agreed to pay back $3.5 million.IN JULY 2004 Miscavige hosted Tom Cruise’s forty-second birthday party aboardthe Scientology cruise ship Freewinds. The Golden Era Musicians, includingMiscavige’s father on trumpet, played songs from Cruise’s movies as ɹlm clipsɻickered on the giant overhead screens installed especially for the occasion.Cruise himself danced and sang “Old Time Rock and Roll,” reprising a famousscene in Risky Business, the movie that firmly established him as a star.Occasionally, the Freewinds is used to conɹne those Sea Org members that thechurch considers most at risk for ɻight. Among the crew on the ship duringCruise’s birthday party was Valeska Paris, a twenty-six-year-old Swiss woman.Paris had grown up in Scientology and joined the Sea Org when she was"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"fourteen. Three years later, her stepfather, a self-made millionaire, committedsuicide, leaving a diary in which he blamed the church for ɻeecing his fortune.When Valeska’s mother denounced the church on French television, Valeska wasisolated at the Clearwater base in order to keep her away from her mother. Thenext year, at the age of eighteen, she was sent to the Freewinds. She was told shewould be on the ship for two weeks. She was held there against her will fortwelve years. Shortly before Cruise arrived, Paris developed a cold sore, whichcaused Miscavige to consign her to a condition of Treason, so she wasn’t allowedto go to the birthday party, but she later did wind up serving Cruise and hisgirlfriend at the time, the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz.In October, Miscavige acknowledged Cruise’s place in Scientology byawarding him the Freedom Medal of Valor. Miscavige called Cruise “the mostdedicated Scientologist I know” before an audience of Sea Org members whohad spent much of their lives working for the church for a little more than sevendollars a day. Then he hung the diamond-encrusted platinum medallion aroundthe star’s neck.“I think you know that I am there for you,” Cruise said to the thrilledaudience. “And I do care, so very, very, very much.” He turned to an imposingportrait of Hubbard, standing beside a globe. “To LRH!” he said, with a crispsalute.Lana Mitchell, the cook who had been accused of feeding Cruise the poisonedshrimp a few months before, had gotten out of Happy Valley, but she watchedthe ceremony while in RPF, along with some two hundred of her detainedcolleagues. About ɹfty of them were Sea Org executives who had been purgedby Miscavige. They were being held in the Los Angeles complex on L. RonHubbard Way, in the massive blue former hospital where Spanky Taylor and somany others had been conɹned. Some had been in the organization for morethan twenty years and had worked directly for Hubbard. They were completelycut oʃ from the outside world—no television, radio, or even any music. Asmany as forty people were crammed into each of the former hospital rooms,with only one bathroom to share. Often there was not enough food to goaround. Some of those conɹned had severe medical conditions, including UweStuckenbrock, the former international security chief, who suʃered frommultiple sclerosis and had deteriorated to the point of being unable to speak.One of the jobs Mitchell was assigned on RPF was welding, but she had neverdone it before, and she burned her eyes because she wasn’t wearing theprotective glasses correctly. She got no medical attention at all.Every eʃort was made to keep RPF’ers out of view. Windows were curtained"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"so no one could see in or out. They traveled through tunnels and over rooftopswhen they needed to move about within the complex. There were no days oʃ,although they were allowed to call their families on Christmas. Their solediversion was watching the big Scientology galas on television. After all, theelaborate sets for these events were constructed by the RPF’ers in Los Angelesor at Flag Base in Clearwater. To view the big Cruise event, they were all takento the mess hall.One of the penitents was Mark McKinstry, who had been National SalesManager at Bridge Publications when the movie version of Battleɹeld Earth,starring John Travolta, came out in 2000. Hubbard’s tale is about an alien raceof “Psychlos,” who have turned people into slaves—until a hero arises toliberate humanity. Travolta had worked for years to get the movie made, andwound up paying a signiɹcant portion out of his own pocket. It was at the peakof his career. “I told my manager, ‘If we can’t do the things now that we want todo, what good is the power?’ ” he remarked at the time. Miscavige had beendeeply involved in the ɹlming from the beginning. He would watch dailies ofthe ɹlm in Clearwater while he was overseeing the handling of the LisaMcPherson case. His critiques would then be typed up and sent to theScientology representative who was always at Travolta’s side. When the moviewas completed, Miscavige called Travolta to congratulate him, saying that LRHwould be proud. He predicted it was going to be a blockbuster.McKinstry had been working for a year promoting the movie edition of thebook. He traveled across the country with Travolta to push the book inbookstores, malls, and Walmarts. About 750,000 copies were sold. Like manyothers who have spent time with Travolta, McKinstry came to like himimmensely. The actor was devoting a substantial amount of his own time andenergy to making the book a success. But when the movie came out, it was acritical and box-oɽce catastrophe. Even at the premiere, Sea Org members hadto be bused in to Mann’s Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard to ɹll theempty seats for as many as three shows a day. For some of them, it was the ɹrstmovie they had seen in years. “ ‘Battleɹeld Earth’ may well turn out to be theworst movie of this century,” the New York Times critic observed, in whatproved to be a typical review. There were false accusations that the ɹlmcontained subliminal messages promoting Scientology. Travolta’s career wentinto a lengthy dark period. Cruise later complained to Miscavige, saying that themovie was terrible for the church’s public image.5 Miscavige responded that itwould never have been made if he’d had anything to do with it.McKinstry was dismayed when he went to a screening of the movie and"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"watched people walking out or booing. His wife could see that he was upset andasked what was wrong. “Why didn’t anyone watch this movie before it wasreleased?” he said. She reported to the church what he had said, and he wasordered to RPF.SHORTLY BEFORE HE RECEIVED Scientology’s top award, Cruise ended his three-yearrelationship with Penélope Cruz. Shelly Miscavige had been supervising herauditing and helping her through the Puriɹcation Rundown. But, like Nicole,Penélope was suspect in the eyes of the church’s leader. She was anindependent-minded person and continued to meditate and identify herself as aBuddhist.Cruise traveled with a Scientology delegation to open a magniɹcent newchurch in Madrid, where he read his speech to the crowd in halting Spanish.Before the opening, however, he was sitting with his sister Lee Anne, who hadbecome his publicist. Mike Rinder, who was in the room, remembers that Cruiseheatedly complained to his sister that no one had been able to ɹnd him a newgirlfriend. Miscavige walked in, Rinder says, and Cruise made the samecomplaint to him.6Miscavige took the hint. “I want you to look for the prettiest women in thechurch,” Tom De Vocht remembers Miscavige saying. “Get their names andphone numbers.” Miscavige then assigned Greg Wilhere and Tommy Davis toaudition all the young actresses who were in Scientology—about a hundred,according to Marc Headley, who observed some of the videos. Shelly Miscavige,the leader’s wife, oversaw the project personally. Wilhere and Davisimmediately went to work. The women weren’t told why they were beinginterviewed, but they were asked about their opinions of Cruise and where theywere on the Bridge. Wilhere, who was actually in the Hole at the time, wastaken out of conɹnement, given a BlackBerry and ɹve thousand dollars to buycivilian clothes at a Saks Fifth Avenue outlet, then sent to New York and LosAngeles to videotape the interviews. Rinder noticed that when Cruise arrived atthe Freedom Medal of Valor ceremony a month later, he was accompanied by araven-haired young actress and model, Yolanda Pecoraro. She was born intoScientology and had completed a number of courses at the Celebrity Centre andon the Freewinds, but she was only nineteen years old. Cruise was forty-two atthe time.The Scientology search team came up with another aspiring actress, NazaninBoniadi, twenty-ɹve years old, who had been born in Iran and raised in London."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Naz was well educated and beautiful in the way that Cruise was inclined torespond to—dark and slender, with large eyes and a ɻashing smile. She hadstudied pre-med at the University of California at Irvine before deciding to tryher luck as an actress. More important for the purposes of the match, however,was the fact that Boniadi was an OT V. Her mother was also a Scientologist.In early November 2004, Naz was informed that she had been selected for aspecial program that was critical to the future of the church, but it was so secretshe wouldn’t be allowed to tell anyone, even her mother. Naz was movedimmediately into the Celebrity Centre, where she spent a month going throughsecurity checks and special auditing programs. She hoped the project hadsomething to do with human rights, which was her special interest, but all shewas told was that her participation would end bigotry against Scientology.At one point during the intensive auditing and security checks, Wilhereinformed her that she would have to break up with her longtime boyfriend inorder for the project to proceed. She refused. She couldn’t understand why herboyfriend posed any kind of problem; indeed, she had personally introduced himto Scientology. Wilhere persisted, asking what it would take for her to break oʃthe romance. Flustered, she responded that she would break up if she knew hehad been cheating on her. According to Naz’s friends, the very next day, Wilherebrought in her boyfriend’s conɹdential auditing ɹles and showed her severalinstances of his inɹdelities, which had been circled in red. Naz felt betrayed, butalso guilty, because Wilhere blamed her for failing to know and report herboyfriend’s ethical lapses herself; after all, she had audited him on severaloccasions. Obviously, she had missed his “withhold.” She confronted herboyfriend and he confessed. That was the end of their relationship.7Another time, Naz was asked what her “ideal scene for 2-D”—in other words,her dream date—would be. It was eating sushi and going ice-skating. But shewondered why that was important.One of her assignments was to study a bulletin of Hubbard’s titled “TheResponsibilities of Leaders.” It is Hubbard’s deconstruction of the lives of thenineteenth-century South American military leader Simón Bolívar and hisferociously protective mistress, a socialite named Manuela Sáenz. Bolívar,Hubbard writes, “was a military commander without peer in history. Why hewould fail and die an exile to be later deiɹed is thus of great interest. Whatmistakes did he make?” Sáenz, his consort, “was a brilliant, beautiful and ablewoman. She was loyal, devoted, quite comparable to Bolivar, far above the cutof average humanoids. Why then did she live a viliɹed outcast, receive suchviolent social rejection and die of poverty and remain unknown to history?"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"What mistakes did she make?”Hubbard’s analysis was that Bolívar knew how to do only one thing brilliantly—to lead men in battle—and therefore he tended to resort to military solutionswhen diplomacy or politics would better serve. “He was too good at this onething,” Hubbard observes. “So he never looked to any other skill and he nevereven dreamed there was any other way.” Bolívar failed to use his immenseauthority to reward his friends and punish his enemies; thus his friends desertedhim and his enemies grew stronger. Craving glory and the love of his people,Bolívar disdained the bloody intrigues that might have kept him in power. “Henever began to recognize a suppressive and never considered anyone neededkilling except on a battleɹeld,” Hubbard coldly sums up. “His addiction to themost unstable drug in history—fame—killed Bolivar.”Manuela Sáenz might have saved him. She had qualities that he lacked, butshe, too, made mistakes. For all her cleverness, she never contrived to makeBolívar marry her, which would have given her the standing that she badlyneeded. “She was utterly devoted, completely brilliant and utterly incapable ofbringing oʃ an action of any ɹnal kind,” Hubbard notes. “She violated thepower formula in not realizing that she had power.” She should have taken onthe portfolio of Bolívar’s secret police chief (as Mary Sue did for Hubbard). “Shewas not ruthless enough to make up for his lack of ruthlessness and notprovident enough to make up for his lack of providence,” Hubbard writes. “Shewas an actress for the theater alone.”In Hubbard’s view, the moral of Bolívar and Sáenz’s tragedy is that those withpower must use it. Someone close to power, like Manuela, has to dedicateherself to enlarging the strength of her partner. “Real powers are developed bytight conspiracies of this kind,” Hubbard writes. If Manuela had been willing tosupport Bolívar completely, Hubbard concludes, she would have been a trulyhistoric ɹgure, rather than being “unknown even in the archives of her countryas the heroine she was.”Nazanin Boniadi was obviously being groomed for leadership. Why else wouldshe be reading about Bolívar and Sáenz? But what lesson was she supposed todraw? She was puzzled by the demands the church was placing on her, whichhad little to do with human rights. Along with the security checks and thecoursework, Naz was told to have her braces taken oʃ and was given veryexpensive beauty treatments. Wilhere informed her that the “director” of thespecial project had decided that her hair had too much red in it, so a stylist tothe stars came to the Celebrity Centre to darken and highlight her hair. Thencame the shopping spree. Wilhere took Naz to Rodeo Drive and spent twenty"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"thousand dollars for her new wardrobe.Finally, Naz and Wilhere ɻew to New York, ɹrst class. She guessed that themission would ɹnally be revealed to her. They stopped at the New York Org,ostensibly on routine business, but there they happened to run into Tom Cruise.Tommy Davis was with him. Although it all seemed like a happy coincidence,Naz was a little ɻustered. Not only was Cruise the biggest star in the world, hehad also just been accorded the highest honor in Scientology. She said to him,“Very well done, sir.” (Later she was corrected for saying that, because youdon’t commend your senior.)Cruise was charming. He said that he and Davis were headed over to theEmpire State Building and then to Nobu for some sushi—why didn’t they jointhem? Afterward, they all went skating at Rockefeller Center, which was closedto the public while they were on the rink. It was beginning to seem a little tooperfect. She spent that first night with Cruise in the Trump Tower, where he hadtaken an entire floor for his entourage.Cruise invited Naz to hang out on the set of War of the Worlds, which wasshooting in Athens, New York, the next morning. At the end of the day, Davisaccompanied her back to the city. In the limo, he handed Naz a non-disclosureagreement. There was no lawyer present, and she wasn’t given a copy of whatshe signed. He informed her that the “mission” was now oʃ the table. This—therelationship with Cruise—was far more important. Davis warned that if she didanything to upset Cruise he would personally destroy her.Naz wasn’t resistant. She wanted to help the world, and she had faith thatScientology could do that. Cruise was dazzling. Scientology was deeplyimportant to both of them. It was obviously meant to be, so why question it?According to several knowledgeable sources, within a few weeks Naz movedinto Cruise’s house. Davis and Jessica Feshbach were constantly tutoring her inhow to behave toward the star. One evening, she and Cruise had dinner withseveral Scientologists, including Tommy Davis and Cruise’s niece, LaurenHaigney, who was in the Sea Org and was posted to Gold Base. She had beenKaty Haggis’s best friend all through their childhood. They were at the DelphianSchool together. At the dinner, Lauren talked about her friendship with Katy,and how she had decided to break oʃ their relationship when Katy said she wasa lesbian. Naz was shocked, not just by the comment but by the fact thateveryone agreed with her decision.8In December, Cruise took Naz to his vacation house in Telluride, where theywere joined by David and Shelly Miscavige. While they were at Cruise’s retreat,David and Shelly watched a screener of Million Dollar Baby. Afterward,"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Miscavige said it had been diɽcult to sit through. He complained about what apoor example of a Scientologist Haggis was, and said that he needed to get backon the Bridge and stop making such awful, low-tone ɹlms. Cruise agreed. “Heneeds to get his ethics in,” he remarked.Naz was having an awful menstrual period, and she wanted to beg oʃ thefestive dinner they had planned, but she knew she was obliged to play thehostess. Still, she felt miserable and her mind was foggy. A couple of times,Miscavige addressed comments to her, and she couldn’t quite understand whathe said. Miscavige speaks in a rapid-ɹre Philly brogue, and Naz had to ask himto repeat himself more than once. The next day, both Davis and Cruise dressedher down for disrespecting the church leader—speciɹcally, for “insulting his TR1.” In Scientology lingo, that refers to the basic Training Routine aboutcommunicating with another person. Naz had embarrassed Miscavige because hewasn’t able to get his message across. Davis said that her conduct wasinexcusable. If she was in pain, she should have taken a Tylenol.With his characteristic intensity, Cruise himself later explained the seriousnessof the situation: “You don’t get it. It goes like this.” He raised his hand over hishead. “First, there’s LRH.” He moved his hand down a few inches. “Then, thereis COB.” Bringing his hand down to his own eye level, he said, “Then there’sme.”Two weeks later, Jessica Feshbach told Naz to pack her things. Cruise was toobusy to say good-bye. Naz’s last glimpse was of him working out in his homegym.Davis later explained to her that Cruise had simply changed his mind aboutthe relationship, deciding that he needed someone with more power. But thestar was willing to make amends by paying for a package that would allow herto attain OT VII. Continuing up the Bridge would help her deal with her griefand loss, Davis assured her.In February 2005, Naz went to Clearwater to take the courses. At ɹrst, shewas treated like a VIP, but soon one of her friends noticed dramatic changes inher—she was weeping all the time. Naz conɹded that she had just gone througha wrenching breakup with Tom Cruise. The shocked friend immediatelyreported her to Ethics. Naz was assigned a condition of Treason and ordered todo reparations for the damages she had done to the group by revealing herrelationship with Cruise. She was made to dig ditches and scrub public toiletswith a toothbrush. Finally, in June, she worked her way back into good standingwith the church, but she was ordered to stay away from the Celebrity Centre.Davis advised her to go live in some far corner of the world and never utter"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"another word about Tom Cruise.9The search for a new mate for the star now went beyond Scientologists.Cruise brieɻy courted the Colombian actress Sofía Vergara, whom he met at apre-Oscar party hosted by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, but that relationshipdissolved when Vergara refused to become a Scientologist. The religion was acrucial factor, both for Cruise and for the church. Cruise was particularlyinterested in Jennifer Garner. Other actresses were invited to the CelebrityCentre to audition for what they believed was a role in the Mission: Impossibleseries. The names included Kate Bosworth, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan, ScarlettJohansson—and Katie Holmes.Holmes was an ingenue with almond-shaped brown eyes, who describedherself as a twenty-six-year-old virgin. She had been a top student at an all-girlsCatholic high school in Toledo, Ohio, but like Tommy Davis, she had droppedout of Columbia University after a single semester. Soon she was starring on theteenage soap opera Dawson’s Creek and had a modest ɹlm career in coquettishroles. Church researchers discovered an interview she had given to Seventeen inOctober 2004. “I think every young girl dreams about [her wedding],” Holmestold the magazine. “I used to think I was going to marry Tom Cruise.” She haddeveloped a crush on the actor when he appeared in Risky Business. At the time,she was four years old.Katie and Tom met in April 2005. “I was in love from the moment that Ishook his hand for the ɹrst time,” she later told talk-show host Jay Leno. Cruiseis famous for his ardent courtship—ɻowers, jewelry, and imaginative dates. Hetook Katie on a nighttime helicopter ride over Los Angeles, with take-out sushi.Within a little more than two weeks, she had moved into Cruise’s Beverly Hillsmansion, ɹred her manager and agent and replaced them with hisrepresentatives, and had begun to be accompanied by Jessica Feshbach, whowas explained in press interviews as being her “best friend.”In May, Cruise appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The audience, nearly allwomen, were in a near-hysterical state of anticipation even before Cruise cameout on the stage, so his behavior has to be seen against a backdrop of a highlytitillated screaming mass, to which he responded like a surfer catching a massivewave. He pumped his ɹst in the air and knelt on the ɻoor. “Something’shappened to you!” Winfrey exclaimed.“I’m in love!” he explained.“We’ve never seen you behave like this before!”“I know!” Cruise said, jumping backward onto her couch. Then he grabbedWinfrey’s hands and began wrestling with her. “You’re gone!” she kept saying."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"“You’re gone!” It was a scene of complete delirium.Cruise’s spectacular and highly public romance was overshadowing thepromotion for War of the Worlds, the movie he had just made with Spielberg,which would be released the following month. A few weeks after the Winfreyshow, Cruise did an interview with Today show host Matt Lauer as Holmes satnearby. The questions were friendly, and Cruise seemed happy and relaxed untilLauer mentioned that Holmes had agreed to take up Scientology. “At this stagein your life, could you be with someone who doesn’t have an interest?” Lauerasked.“You know, Scientology is something that you don’t understand,” Cruiseresponded. “It’s like, you could be a Christian and be a Scientologist, okay.”“So, it doesn’t replace religion,” Lauer offered.“It is a religion, because it’s dealing with the spirit. You as a spiritual being.”Lauer then asked about a comment that Cruise had recently made aboutactress Brooke Shields, who had written that antidepressants had helped her getthrough her postpartum depression. “I’ve never agreed with psychiatry—ever!”Cruise said. He was dressed in black, his muscular arms on display; he had astubble beard and his hair was draped in bangs across his forehead. He radiatedan athletic intensity and a barely contained fury. “As far as the Brooke Shieldsthing, look, you’ve got to understand, I really care about Brooke Shields. I think,here’s a wonderful and talented woman. And I want to see her do well. And Iknow that psychiatry is a pseudo-science.”“But, Tom, if she said that this particular thing helped her feel better, whetherit was the antidepressants or going to a counselor or psychiatrist, isn’t thatenough?”“Matt, you have to understand this,” Cruise said, glowering. “Here we aretoday, where I talk out against drugs and psychiatric abuses of electric-shockingpeople—okay, against their will—of drugging children with them not knowingthe eʃect of these drugs. Do you know what Adderall is? Do you know Ritalin?Do you know now that Ritalin is a street drug? Do you understand that?”“The difference is—”“No, no, Matt.”“This wasn’t against her will, though.”“Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.”“But this wasn’t against her will.”“Matt, I’m asking you a question.”“I understand there’s abuse of all these things.”“No, you see, here’s the problem,” Cruise said. “You don’t know the history of"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"psychiatry. I do.”Lauer was taken aback by Cruise’s aggressiveness, but he pressed on. “Do youexamine the possibility that these things do work for some people? That yes,there are abuses, and yes, maybe they’ve gone too far in some areas. Maybethere are too many kids on Ritalin. Maybe electric shock—”“Too many kids on Ritalin?” Cruise said, shaking his head. “Matt.”“Aren’t there examples where it works?”“Matt, Matt, Matt, you don’t even—you’re glib. You don’t even know whatRitalin is.” He said there were ways that Shields could solve her depression—hementioned diet and exercise—other than drugs. “And there are ways of doing itwithout that, so that we don’t end up in a brave new world. The thing that I’msaying about Brooke is that there’s misinformation, okay. And she doesn’tunderstand the history of psychiatry. She doesn’t understand in the same waythat you don’t understand it, Matt.”SCIENTOLOGY’S HISTORY OF psychiatry holds it responsible for many of the ills thathave aʃected humanity—war, racism, ethnic cleansing, terrorism—all in thepursuit of social control and proɹt. The church has opened an exhibit,“Psychiatry: An Industry of Death,” on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Itdescribes the often grisly and benighted practices that have characterized theevolution of the profession, including madhouses, lobotomies, electroshocktherapy, and the proliferation of psychiatric drugs to treat spurious diagnoses.Scientology views this history as a long march by psychiatrists to manipulatehuman behavior and institute world government.Although it’s not included in the exhibit, Hubbard’s chronology of psychiatryactually begins “ɹve billion years ago” with the development of a particulartechnique that was developed “in the Maw Confederation of the Sixty-thirdGalaxy”:Take a sheet of glass and put it in front of the preclear—clear, very clear glass—which is supercooled,preferably about a −100 centigrade. You got that? Supercooled, you know? And then put the preclearright in front of this supercooled sheet of glass and suddenly shove his face into the glass....Takes about twenty seconds, then, to accomplish a total brainwash of a case.Now, if you wish to play God, as the whole-track psychiatrist did at that time, all you have to say atthis time is, of course, “Go to Earth and be president,” or something like that, you know? And a thetan,being properly brainwashed now, will take off, and that’s that."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Hubbard also blamed psychiatrists, allied with the tyrant Xenu, for carryingout genocide in the Galactic Confederacy seventy-ɹve million years ago. Thereare obvious parallels in this legend with the Nazi regime, which used doctors,including psychiatrists, to carry out the extermination of the mentally ill, alongwith homosexuals, Gypsies, and Jews; and also by the Soviet government, whichemployed psychiatrists to diagnose political dissidents and lock them away.Hubbard lived through these shameful events, and they no doubt colored hisimagination.After Hubbard’s death, Miscavige continued the campaign. In 1995, he toldthe International Association of Scientologists that the church’s goals for the newmillennium were to “place Scientology at the absolute center of society” and to“eliminate psychiatry in all its forms.” The Citizens Commission on HumanRights, a lobby group created by the Church of Scientology that runs thepsychiatry museum, maintains that no mental diseases have ever been proven toexist. In this view, psychiatrists have been responsible for the Holocaust,apartheid, and even 9/11. The commission is not above bending the truth tomake its point. The president of CCHR, Dave Figueroa, asserts that Osama binLaden’s chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a psychiatrist who took control ofbin Laden’s “thought patterns.” “Whatever type of drugs that Zawahiri used tomake that change in bin Laden, we don’t know,” Figueroa explained. “We knowthere was a real change in that guy’s attitude.” This view is reiterated in theterrorism portion of the museum. (In fact, Zawahiri is a general surgeon, not apsychiatrist.)10CCHR’s main eʃort has been an international campaign against the use ofpsychiatric drugs, especially for children. The surgeon general of the UnitedStates issued a report in 2001 claiming that more than twenty percent ofchildren ages nine to seventeen had a diagnosable mental or addictive disorder,and that four million American children suʃered from major mental illness.There is obviously an immense market for medications to treat such disorders.About ten percent of Americans over the age of six are on antidepressants, andantipsychotic drugs are the top-selling category of drugs in the country. Theyhave become a plague on the schoolgrounds of America, with indiscriminateprescriptions creating a new culture of drug dependency—one that thepharmaceutical industry and the medical profession bear some responsibility for.Haggis has been a substantial supporter of the CCHR. As a boy, he says, hespent most of his days staring out the window, daydreaming—a candidate for anattention deɹcit disorder diagnosis. “I identiɹed with the oddballs and themisɹts,” he said. “Those who conform have very little chance of making a"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"diʃerence in life.” He was sure that if his parents had medicated him, he mightnever have become a writer. He hosted fund-raisers for CCHR in his home. “Isimply believe that psychiatric drugs are over-prescribed, especially tochildren,” he said. “I think that is a crime.”Scientologists have been seeking ways of criminalizing psychiatric remedies.In the same period that Cruise was chastising Brooke Shields for takingantidepressants, Kirstie Alley and Kelly Preston were testifying before statelawmakers in Florida, who passed a bill, written in part by Scientologists, thatwould hold schoolteachers criminally liable for suggesting to parents that theirchildren might be suʃering from a mental health condition, such as attentiondeɹcit disorder. Governor Jeb Bush vetoed the bill. Governor Jon Huntsman didthe same in Utah. Similar bills have been pushed by the CCHR in other states. Inher Florida testimony, Kirstie Alley held up photographs of children who hadcommitted suicide after taking psychotropic drugs. “None of these children werepsychotic before they took these drugs,” she asserted, sobbing so hard she couldbarely speak. “None of these children were suicidal before they took thesedrugs.”Some drug makers have covered up studies that indicate an increased dangerof suicidal or violent thoughts caused by psychotropic medicines. Eli Lilly, forinstance, suppressed data showing that patients who were taking the populardrug Prozac—the only antidepressant certiɹed as safe for children—were twelvetimes more likely to attempt suicide than patients taking similar medications.Antidepressants have been implicated in a number of schoolyard shootings, suchas the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, where two students killed twelveof their classmates and a teacher. One of the killers was taking Luvox at thetime. Adderall—one of the drugs cited by Cruise—is an amphetamine oftenprescribed for attention-deɹcit/hyperactivity disorder; it sometimes causesincreased aggression in children and adolescents. Ritalin, the most common drugprescribed for ADHD, is similar to cocaine in its potential for addiction.According to The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, aperson using Ritalin, Adderall, or other cocaine-like drugs “can experiencenervousness, restlessness, agitation, suspiciousness, paranoia, hallucinations anddelusions, impaired cognitive functions, delirium, violence, suicide, andhomicide.”But people who are taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood-stabilizing drugs are already at a higher risk for suicide or violent behavior. Oneof the dangers of prescribing an antidepressant is that it may give the patient thestimulus he or she needs to act on suicidal impulses that are already present."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Sudden withdrawal from antidepressants can prompt suicidal thoughts as well.Several studies have found that the risk of suicide was just as great for thosewho don’t receive antidepressants as for those who do; over time, however,patients taking antidepressants are less likely to kill themselves. Suchmedications now come with warnings about increased suicidal behavior. Andyet, one study noted the steady decline of overall suicide rates in the UnitedStates since ɻuoxetine (Prozac) was introduced in the American market. Theauthors estimated that the drug was responsible for saving 33,600 lives between1988 and 2002.There are numerous examples of Scientologists who have considered oractually committed suicide, or engaged in violence, who might have been helpedif they had taken psychotropic medicines. In Buʃalo, New York, on March 13,2003 (L. Ron Hubbard’s birthday), twenty-eight-year-old Jeremy Perkinsstabbed his mother seventy-seven times. He was a schizophrenic with a historyof violence and hallucinations, who had rejected psychiatric treatment becausehe was a Scientologist. Hana Eltringham, who had been Hubbard’s chief deputy,believes that Scientology itself caused her own shattered mental state. For yearsafter attaining OT III, Eltringham had frequent thoughts of suicide. Theunremitting migraines and voices in her head made her despair. Several times,she came close to jumping oʃ the top ɻoor of the church’s headquarters inClearwater, but restrained herself because she was worried that it would bringdisgrace upon the church and Hubbard’s teachings. It was only when she left thechurch and began taking Prozac that her headaches and her suicidal thoughtswent away. “It has changed my life,” she claimed. Her friend Mary FlorenceBarnett, Shelly Miscavige’s mother, had similar symptoms—constant headachesand suicidal thoughts. She conɹded to Eltringham that she wanted to kill herselfin order to stop the suppressive body thetans from taking over her mind. Barnetteventually went outside the oɽcial church to receive Scientology counseling, aheretical practice known in Scientology as squirreling. (The church denies thatBarnett became involved with dissident Scientologists, but if she had, that wouldhave placed David and Shelly Miscavige in a compromised position with thechurch. They would have been Potential Trouble Sources if they failed todisconnect from her.) On September 8, 1985, Barnett’s body was found. She hadbeen shot three times in the chest and once through the temple with a riɻe. Bothof her wrists were slashed. She left two suicide notes. The Los Angeles CountyMedical Examiner ruled her death a suicide.In 2007, Kyle Brennan, twenty years old, who was not a Scientologist, went tostay with his father, a member of the church, in Clearwater. Brennan was taking"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Lexapro, an antidepressant heavily promoted by its manufacturer, ForestLaboratories. He was also under the care of a psychiatrist. According to courtrecords, Brennan’s father, Thomas, was ordered to “handle” his son. ThomasBrennan’s auditor was Denise Miscavige Gentile, David Miscavige’s twin sister.She spoke on the phone to Kyle’s mother, who was not a Scientologist, andurged her to enroll her son in Narconon, the church’s drug-treatment program.His mother refused, pointing out that the program costs approximately $25,000;moreover, Kyle was not a drug addict. She sued, charging that church oɽcialshad ordered Thomas Brennan to lock his son’s Lexapro in the trunk of his car.Days after that, Kyle shot himself to death with a .357 Magnum that his fatherkept in his bedside table. (The suit was dismissed for lack of evidence.)The long history of humanity’s inadequate attempts to deal with depression,and the manifold ways in which insanity expresses itself, have never yielded aclear path. Tragedies such as the suicide of Kyle Brennan demonstrate thedanger of dogmatic interpretations of psychiatry, such as those oʃered by TomCruise and other Scientology celebrities on the subject. The AmericanPsychiatric Association felt so threatened by Cruise’s statements on the Todayshow that the president of the organization issued a statement aɽrming thatmental illnesses are real medical conditions. “It is irresponsible for Mr. Cruise touse his movie publicity tour to promote his own ideological views and deterpeople with mental illness from getting the care they need,” said Steven S.Sharfstein, the president of the APA. But at the 2005 annual meeting of theInternational Association of Scientologists, Mike Rinder, who had been let out ofthe Hole for the occasion, credited Cruise with persuading the Food and DrugAdministration to post suicide warnings on the labels of two psychiatric drugswithin days of his interview with Lauer.“If someone wants to get oʃ drugs, I can help them,” Cruise told the Germanmagazine Der Spiegel, in April 2005. “I myself have helped hundreds of peopleget off drugs.”HAGGIS HAD SENT a rough cut of his movie Crash to the Toronto Film Festival, animportant venue for independent ɹlms that are looking for distribution. InSeptember 2004, the movie met its ɹrst audience at the Elgin Theatre, anelegant old vaudeville house downtown, not far from the spot where Paul soldtickets at the soft-porn theater his professor used to run.As he watched the movie, Haggis was appalled. Everything that was wrongwas glaringly apparent on the huge screen. He sat glumly waiting for it to end,"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"calculating what could be salvaged. So when the audience rose to its feet at theend, cheering, Haggis couldn’t believe what was happening. Lion’s Gate Filmsbought Crash for $3.5 million and scheduled it for release the following spring.Crash opened quietly in April 2005. There were no billboards or bus signs,which were already touting the arrival of War of the Worlds in June. The reviewsfor Crash were passionate but polarized. Roger Ebert gave it four stars, calling it“a movie of intense fascination.” A. O. Scott, who reviewed it for The New YorkTimes, was less infatuated. It was a “frustrating movie,” he wrote, “full of heartand devoid of life; crudely manipulative when it tries hardest to be subtle; andprofoundly complacent in spite of its intention to unsettle and disturb.” Therewas no actual premiere, just a screening at the Academy Theater on WilshireBoulevard, and no grand party afterward. Haggis and his family went out todinner.Despite the conɻicting reviews and limited distribution, a groundswell wasbuilding for the movie, driven entirely by audiences who were caught up in anational conversation over race and class that the movie prompted. It would goon to earn nearly $100 million in international sales. Million Dollar Baby had justwon the Academy Award for Best Picture that February. Haggis was writing aJames Bond movie, Casino Royale, in addition to the Eastwood picture Flags ofOur Fathers. He was flying.Tom Cruise’s career was headed in the opposite direction. Haggis had seenhim at the Vanity Fair Oscar party. Cruise and Tommy Davis arrived on Ducatimotorcycles, wearing black jackets, and were let in the back door of Morton’sSteakhouse in Beverly Hills. They said hello to Haggis, but nothing more. Pollsshowed that Cruise was still ranked as the most powerful actor in Hollywood,and even the most powerful celebrity in the world, but he was also rankednumber one as the celebrity that people would least like to have as their bestfriend.When Cruise returned to Gold Base, Miscavige showed oʃ his Harley-Davidson V-rod motorcycle, which had been custom-painted a candy-apple redover a brushed nickel surface. Miscavige’s brother-in-law, John Brousseau,known for his elegant craftsmanship, had done the work. In addition tooverseeing the renovation of the Freewinds, Brousseau had installed bars on thedoors of the Hole shortly after Rathbun escaped.According to Brousseau, “Cruise was drooling” over the motorcycle. “God,could you paint my bike like that?” he asked. Brousseau looked at Miscavige,who nodded. Cruise brought in two motorcycles to be painted, a TriumphRocket III and a Honda Rune. Spielberg had given him the Honda after the"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"ɹlming of War of the Worlds; it had already been custom-painted by the setdesigner. Brousseau had to take each motorcycle apart completely and nickel-plate all the parts before painting them.11 Cruise drove the newly painted Rune,with Katie on the back, to the fans’ screening of his movie at Grauman’s ChineseTheatre in June.Tom Cruise and David Miscavige at the Church of Scientology opening in central Madrid, 2004After that, Brousseau was regularly assigned to work on special projects forCruise. Shelly Miscavige had drafted Brousseau and seven other Sea Orgmembers, along with many of Cruise’s employees at Odin Productions, to workfor more than two weeks rehabilitating Cruise’s leased nine-bedroom mansionon Alpine Drive in Beverly Hills—painting, ɹxing the roof, doing cabinet work,stretching the carpet, rewiring, pressure-washing the tennis court, weeding andplanting, repairing the irrigation system, and even reorganizing the clothes in"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"the closets. In the last week, Brousseau says, he had at least a hundredcontractors under his direction in order to get the house ready for Cruise.Brousseau and a Sea Org executive, Steve Marlowe, also oversaw therenovations on a Blue Bird bus, like Hubbard’s, that Cruise had purchased. Later,Cruise bought another bus, which he called The Silver Screen. Brousseau spentthree months commuting to the Marathon Coach factory in Coburg, Oregon, tooversee the retroɹtting of the forty-foot vehicle into an elaborate motor home.Brousseau estimates that the redesign cost about $1.5 million, but that doesn’tinclude his labor or that of Sea Org members in the Golden Era propdepartment, who manufactured the furniture, countertops, and cabinetry. In2006, Brousseau also customized a limousine for the star, using the body of aFord Excursion that he says Cruise acquired using the Scientology ɻeet discount.Katie was pregnant and wanted a new vehicle with a baby seat. Miscavige hadwanted to impress the couple by renovating the Excursion at a local customshop, but the job was poorly done. Miscavige purchased another Excursion forCruise to replace the one that had been botched. Meanwhile, Brousseau spentthe next six months personally rebuilding the original Excursion. He ripped thevehicle down to its frame and installed handmade reclining seats and woodpaneling fashioned from a burl of a eucalyptus tree that had been toppled in astorm. He spent about two thousand hours on the project. The materials werepaid for by Cruise’s production company, but according to Brousseau, his labor,and that of about ten other Sea Org members, was not compensated. “It was ahalf-million-dollar beauty all done by me, with other folks from Scientology,”Brousseau said.Brousseau had even carved a matching Montblanc pen out of the burl, its ownhidden storage case in the vehicle. When Cruise showed it to Katie, she wasdazzled. She turned to Brousseau and asked, “Oh, J.B., did you make that?”“Don’t thank me,” Brousseau quickly responded. “I’m just the hammer. This—,” he said, pointing to Miscavige, “is the hand that wields me.”Cruise, who became a pilot while ɹlming Top Gun, keeps a hangar at anairport in Burbank for his airplane collection. Sea Org members completelyrenovated the hangar, installing a luxurious oɽce that had been fabricated atGolden Era Productions. Brousseau says that the furniture—a dry bar, table andchairs, desks, et cetera—was milled at an RPF base in Los Angeles. Brousseautook dozens of photographs documenting his handiwork on the star’s behalf.No member of the Sea Org has spent more time in Cruise’s service thanTommy Davis, who was viewed within the church as the star’s special handlerand personal assistant. Although Davis maintains that he provided similar"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"services for other celebrities, his assignment to Cruise was his primary dutybetween 2000 and 2004. However, he asserted, “None of the Church staʃinvolved were coerced in any way to assist Mr. Cruise. Church staʃ, and indeedChurch members, hold Mr. Cruise in very high regard and are honored to assisthim.”IN JUNE 2006, Shelly Miscavige disappeared.She had spent her whole life conveying orders and gathering intelligence for apowerful, erratic, domineering church leader, ɹrst for Hubbard and then for herhusband. She and Miscavige were always respectful toward each other in public,if not openly aʃectionate. As he gained power within the church, she began tosee the two of them as reincarnations of Simón Bolívar and Manuela Sáenz, andthe lesson she drew from that previous existence was that she needed to beɹercely protective of her mate, and to keep him from making the kinds ofmistakes that his character was destined to commit. In the eyes of some Sea Orgmembers, Shelly was brittle and imperious, but Rathbun noted that shesometimes objected when Miscavige’s physical assaults threatened to get out ofhand. No one else did.That spring, Shelly returned from a Freewinds voyage before her husband did,and in his absence she decided to arrange the Org Board herself. There were nosettled posts, executives were still churning in the Hole, and the managementstructure was a mess. Taking matters into her own hands, Shelly made a numberof appointments.Soon after her husband came back, Shelly’s mood visibly changed. Herbrother-in-law, John Brousseau, observed that she looked cowed: “The bulldogwas gone.” Shortly before she disappeared, she asked Mike Rinder if Dave stillhad his wedding ring on. Then she vanished. Although a missing-person reporthas been ɹled, the Los Angeles Police Department will not comment on herwhereabouts. She was escorted to her father’s funeral in August 2007. That’s thelast time she was seen in public. Former Sea Org members say she is beingguarded at a church facility in Running Springs, California, near LakeArrowhead, one of the several repositories for Hubbard’s writings. It gets coldthere in the winter. Miscavige sent Shelly a sweater and a pair of gloves forChristmas.In November 2007, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes married in a ɹfteenth-century castle outside of Rome. Among the celebrities attending were JenniferLopez and Marc Anthony, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, Jenna Elfman, and even"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"Brooke Shields. Once again, David Miscavige served as the best man.1 Cruise’s attorney says that Sea Org members were not directed to salute him and that he has had manycordial exchanges with them.2 According to Tommy Davis, “From their perspective, it was the least they could do to express theiraffection.”3 According to Tommy Davis, “These incidents are pure fantasy by Tom De Vocht.”4 The case against Cartwright was settled out of court.5 Cruise’s attorney notes, “Mr. Cruise has never expressed anything but support and respect for the work onBattlefield Earth.”6 Cruise’s attorney says Cruise did not complain about not having a girlfriend at the opening of the churchin Madrid.7 The church has stated, “Scientology ministers maintain and practice a code of conduct known as theAuditor’s Code. The Auditor’s Code provides standards to ensure that priest-penitent communicationsremain strictly conɹdential. All such information is kept strictly conɹdential by a Scientology minister andthe Church.”8 Cruise’s attorney says that this conversation never took place. According to Tommy Davis: “Katy did notlose her friend because she admitted she was gay, she lost her friend because Katy lied to her about beinggay.”9 Several sources independently told me of Boniadi’s experiences with Tom Cruise. All their recollectionswere consistent. Cruise’s attorney says that no Scientology executives set him up with girlfriends, and thatno female Scientologist that Cruise dated moved into his home.10 Also in the exhibit is a photograph of Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, known as Abu Dadah, who is describedas a psychiatrist and the mastermind of the Madrid train bombings in 2004. Yarkas, an al-Qaeda fund-raiser, was a used-car salesman who had little or nothing to do with the Madrid bombings. In a list of 218international known Islamist militants, the only one who ever studied psychology was Ali Mohammed, anEgyptian operative who helped plan the American Embassy bombings in 1998. “Psychologists areconspicuous by their absence,” Steʃen Hertog, a lecturer in comparative politics at the London School ofEconomics, wrote me in a private communication. “The pattern is similar for other types of extremistgroups: Among 215 leading German Nazis with known higher education, there are only 2 psychologists,compared to 71 lawyers.” In another Citizens Commission on Human Rights report, titled “Chaos andTerror: Manufactured by Psychiatry” (www.cchrstl.org/documents/terror.pdf), the supposed mastermind ofthe Madrid bombings is now said to be “Moroccan psychiatrist Abu Haɹzah.” No such person exists on thelist of known Islamist terrorists, nor is anyone by that name attached to the Madrid bombings.11 The church denies Brousseau’s account. Cruise’s attorney denies that his client ever saw Miscavige’s"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"motorcycle and claims,“We have photographic evidence showing the actual painter doing the job. It’s notMr. Brousseau.” However, the attorney did not provide the photos. Brousseau did provide photos of the workhe says he did on each of Cruise’s vehicles he claimed to have worked on."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"P10The Investigationroposition 8, the California initiative to ban marriage between same-sexcouples, appeared on the ballot in 2008. Paul Haggis was deeply involvedin ɹghting the initiative, marching in demonstrations and contributingɹnancially. His advocacy placed a strain on his relationship with Scientology.For several years, he had been concerned about the bigotry he found inside thechurch, especially when it was directed at his two gay daughters. Katy, inparticular, had expressed her discomfort with the way she was treated at theCelebrity Centre, where she had been taking some courses. She had decided togo to another Scientology mission where she wouldn’t feel so judged.One evening, Paul and Deborah went to a small fund-raising dinner at JohnTravolta and Kelly Preston’s house. Deborah and Kelly were on the parents’committee to raise funds for a new Delphi school in Santa Monica. Several othercouples were there, all of them Operating Thetans. One of the guests referred tothe waiter as a faggot.It is diɽcult to imagine such open bigotry in Hollywood, a liberal stronghold,but especially in the home of John Travolta, who has dodged rumors of hissexual orientation since he ɹrst became a star. Despite the onslaught of publicityand sexual harassment suits that have been lodged against the star over theyears, many Scientologists, including Haggis, believed that Travolta was not gay.Haggis had been impressed by his apparently loving relationship with his wifeand children; but it is also common to assume that homosexuality is handled atthe OT III level, where the body thetans that cause such problems can beaudited away. The other diners may have been so convinced of Travolta’s sexualorientation that they felt free to display their prejudice. In any case, Travoltareprimanded his guest, saying that such remarks were not tolerated in theirhome.Haggis was ɻooded with admiration for the ɹrm but graceful way that thestar had handled the situation. After the other guests had departed, Haggis andTravolta had a conversation in his small study. They talked about the bigotrythey had observed in the church. Haggis conɹded that Katy had been made tofeel unwanted at the Celebrity Centre. Travolta said that Hubbard’s writings had"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"been misinterpreted, and he later provided some references that Katy could useto defend herself.When Hubbard wrote Dianetics, in 1950, he reɻected the prevailing socialprejudices, including the psychiatric community, which consideredhomosexuality a mental illness. (It was not removed from the AmericanPsychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders until1973.) “The sexual pervert”—by which Hubbard meant the homosexual—“isactually quite ill physically,” he writes. The following year, he published theTone Scale in Science of Survival. Near the bottom, at 1.1 on the scale, is theCovertly Hostile personality. People in this state engage in casual sex, sadism—and homosexual activity. Hubbard describes this as “the most dangerous andwicked level.... Here is the person who smiles when he inserts a knife bladebetween your vertebrae.” “This is the level of the pervert, the hypocrite, theturncoat. This is the level of the subversive.... A 1.1 is the most dangerouslyinsane person in society and is likely to cause the most damage.... Such peopleshould be taken from the society as rapidly as possible and uniformlyinstitutionalized.” Another way of dealing with them, he writes, is “to dispose ofthem quietly and without sorrow.” He went on: “The sudden and abruptdeletion of all individuals occupying the lower bands of the Tone Scale from thesocial order would result in an almost instant rise in the cultural tone and wouldinterrupt the dwindling spiral into which any society may have entered.”Hubbard occasionally moderated his stance, although he never entirelyrepudiated or discarded his prejudice. In 1952, he said, “Homosexuality is aboutas serious as sneezes.” In 1965, he refers in an executive letter to a “squirrel”who, he says, “was sacked for homosexuality and theft.” Another disaʃectedScientologist, Hubbard notes in the same letter, “is a set-up for an arrest as ahomosexual.” Two years later, when social attitudes toward gays were slowlychanging, he declared, “It has never been any part of my plans to regulate orattempt to regulate the private lives of individuals.” However, becauseeverything Hubbard wrote is sacrosanct in the church, these early views areindelibly ɹxed in the minds of many Scientologists. Long after the founder’sdeath it was still generally believed that auditing would “sort out”homosexuality. Gays in the church were frequently pressed to buy courses ortake additional auditing in order to handle their condition.The ambivalence in the church over the question of sexual orientation isevident in its treatment of Travolta. Over the years, the church has acted toprotect his reputation. Marty Rathbun has said there were many allegations thathe helped “to make go away.” He sometimes worked in concert with Travolta’s"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"attorneys, attempting to keep stories out of the press. In 2003, a gay artist,Michael Pattinson, sued the church, Travolta, and more than twenty otherindividuals, claiming that the star had been held up as an example of howScientology can cure homosexuality. Pattinson said that he spent twenty-ɹveyears in the church, and half a million dollars, trying to change his sexualorientation, without success. (That case was voluntarily withdrawn following anavalanche of countersuits. Both Pattinson and his attorney say they were driveninto bankruptcy.)Haggis identiɹed with homosexuals because they were a minority. They werethe underdogs. They were also two of his daughters. The backers of Proposition8 were using scare tactics to drive their campaign, claiming that homosexualswere going to take over the schools and teach people to be gay. Lauren Haggisactually heard people saying that. Then someone pointed her to a website thatlisted the proposition’s backers. The Church of Scientology of San Diego was onthe list. “I was just ɻoored,” she said. “And so I sent an e-mail to my sisters andmy dad saying, um, what’s going on?”Haggis began peppering Tommy Davis with e-mails, demanding that thechurch support efforts to reverse the marriage ban. “I am going to an anti Prop 8rally in a couple of hours,” he wrote on November 11, 2008, a week after theinitiative passed with 52 percent of the state’s voters. “When can we expect thepublic statement?” Davis responded with a proposed letter that would go to theSan Diego media, saying that the church had been “erroneously listed among thesupporters of Proposition 8.” “ ‘Erroneous’ doesn’t cut it,” Haggis ɹred back.“The church may have had the luxury of not taking a position on this issuebefore, but after taking a position, even erroneously, it can no longer standneutral.” He demanded that the church openly declare itself in favor of gayrights. “Anything less won’t do.”Davis stopped responding. When Haggis prodded him again, Davis admittedthat the correction to the San Diego media was never actually sent. “To behonest I was dismayed when our emails (which I thought were communicationsbetween us) were being cc’d to your daughters,” he wrote. Davis was frustratedbecause, as he explained to Haggis, the church avoids taking political stances.1Davis insisted that it wasn’t the “church” in San Diego that adopted a positionagainst Prop 8. “It was one guy who somehow got it in his head it would be aneat idea and put Church of Scientology San Diego on the list,” Davis insisted.“When I found out, I had it removed from the list.”As far as Davis was concerned, that should have been the end of the matter.Any further actions on the part of the church would only call attention to a"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"mistaken position on an issue that the church wanted to go away. “Paul, I’vereceived no press inquiries,” he said. “If I were to make a statement on this itwould actually bring more attention to the subject than if we leave it be.”But Haggis refused to let the matter drop. “This is not a PR issue, it is a moralissue,” he wrote in February 2009. “Standing neutral is not an option.”In the ɹnal note of this exchange, Haggis conceded, “You were right: nothinghappened—it didn’t ɻap—at least not very much. But I feel we shamedourselves.”Since Haggis’s children had been copied on the correspondence with Davis, ithelped clarify Lauren’s stance with the church. At ɹrst, Davis’s responses gaveher hope, but then she realized, “They’re just trying to minimize it as much aspossible.” After that, “I was totally done with the church.”The experience also helped her to see her father in a diʃerent light. “It’s likenight and day from when I ɹrst moved in with him,” she said. “I didn’t knowthat my dad loved me.”BECAUSE HAGGIS STOPPED COMPLAINING, Davis felt that the issue had been laid to rest.But, far from putting the matter behind him, Haggis began an investigation intothe church. His inquiry, much of it conducted online, echoed the actions of thelead character he was writing for Russell Crowe in The Next Three Days, whogoes on the Internet to research a way to break his wife out of jail.What is so striking about Haggis’s investigation is that few prominent ɹguresattached to the Church of Scientology have actually looked into the charges thathave surrounded their institution for many years. The church discourages suchexamination, telling its members that negative articles are “entheta” and willonly cause spiritual upset. In 1996, the church sent CDs to members to helpthem build their own websites, which would then link them to the Scientologysite; included in the software was a ɹlter that would block any sites containingmaterial that viliɹed the church or revealed esoteric doctrines. Keywords thattriggered the censorship were Xenu, OT III, and the names of prominentScientology critics.Although Haggis never used such a ɹlter, one already existed in his mind.During his thirty-four years in the church he had purposely avoided asking toomany questions or reading materials that he knew would disparage his faith. Butnow, frustrated by his exchange with Davis, he began “poking around.” He cameupon an interview on YouTube with Tommy Davis that had been broadcast byCNN in May 2008. “The worldwide interest in Scientology has never been"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"higher,” Davis boasts on the show. “Scientology has grown more in the last ɹveyears than the last ɹve decades combined.” The anchor, John Roberts, asksDavis about the church’s policy of disconnection, in which followers are urged toseparate themselves from friends or family members who might be critical ofthe organization. “This is a perfect example of how the Internet turns things andtwists things,” Davis responds. “There’s no such thing as disconnection as you’recharacterizing it. And certainly, we have to understand—”“Well, what is disconnection?” Roberts tries to interject.“Scientology is a new religion,” Davis continues, talking over the host. “Themajority of Scientologists in the world, they’re ɹrst generation. So their familymembers aren’t going to be Scientologists.... So, certainly, someone who is aScientologist is going to respect their family members’ beliefs—”“Well, what is disconnection?” Roberts asks again.“And we consider family to be a building block of any society, so anythingthat’s characterized as disconnection, or this kind of thing, it’s just not true.There isn’t any such policy.”Haggis knew this was a lie. His wife, Deborah, had disconnected from herparents twice. When she was in her twenties and acting in Dallas, her motherand stepfather broke away from the church. They were close friends of HanaEltringham, who had stood up for them at their wedding, so when they haddoubts about their faith, they went to see her. Eltringham was then counselingpeople who were considering getting out of Scientology or other new religions.She helped Scientologists confront the contradictions that were implicit in theirfaith, such as Hubbard speaking of events that had taken place trillions orquadrillions of years in the past, although scientists estimate the age of theuniverse to be less than 14 billion years, or the fact that it has never been shownthat anyone has ever obtained any enhanced OT abilities. Eltringham also talkedabout the abuses she observed and experienced. “Hana told us how Sea Orgmembers were treated,” Mary Benjamin, Deborah’s mother, recalled, “how theywere kept in a basement in Los Angeles and fed rice and beans if they didn’tkeep their stats up. How, in the desert, in terrible heat, they would march in acircle for hours.”Like many active members of the church, the Benjamins kept money onaccount—in their case, $2,500—for future courses they intended to take.Deborah’s mother insisted on getting the money back. Deborah knew what a bigdeal that was for the church. She didn’t speak to her parents for more than threeyears, automatically assuming that they must have been declared SuppressivePersons. But when her sister was about to get married, Deborah wrote to the"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"International Justice Chief, the Scientology oɽcial in charge of such matters,who said that she was allowed to see her parents as long as they didn’t sayanything against Scientology. The Benjamins readily agreed.A decade later, however, Deborah went to Clearwater, intending to take someupper-level courses, and learned that the previous ruling no longer applied. Ifshe wanted to do more training, she would have to confront her parents’mistakes. The church recommended that she take the Potential TroubleSource/Suppressive Persons course.Many Scientologists have taken the same course. Deborah’s friend KellyPreston had taken it as well. “I was PTS, but I didn’t realize it, and so I was told,‘You need to be on PTS/SP,’ ” Preston later recalled in her interview forCelebrity magazine. She discovered that her life was full of Suppressive Persons.“Being an artist and having a lot of theta, you really attract those type ofpeople,” Preston said. (“Theta” is a Scientology term for life force.) “I ended uphaving to handle or disconnect from quite a few different people.”It took Deborah a year to complete the course, but it didn’t change herparents’ status. She petitioned oɽcials at the Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles forhelp. They put her on another program that took two more years to ɹnish. Still,nothing changed. If she failed to “handle” her parents—by persuading them tomake amends to the church—she would have to disconnect not only from thembut also from everyone who spoke to them, including her siblings. She realized,“It was that, or else I had to give up being a Scientologist.” The fact that Paulrefused to disconnect from her parents posed yet another conflict.According to the church, Deborah’s parents had been part of a class-actionlawsuit against Scientology by disaʃected members in 1987, which wasdismissed the following year.2 The church required them to denounce the anti-Scientology group and oʃer a “token” restitution. That meant performingcommunity service and following a rehabilitation course, called A to E, forpenitents seeking to get back into the church’s good graces; it includes repayingdebts, taking additional courses, and making public declarations of error.Deborah told her parents that if they wanted to remain in contact with her theyhad to follow the church’s procedures. Her parents, worried that they wouldalso be cut oʃ from their grandson, agreed to perform community service. Forthree months they delivered food in a Meals on Wheels program in Los Angeles.But the church wasn’t satisɹed. Deborah was told that if she maintained contactwith her parents she would be labeled a Potential Trouble Source—a designationthat would alienate her from the entire Scientology community and render herineligible for further training. A senior oɽcial counseled her to agree to"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"disconnect from her parents and have them formally branded SPs. “Until then,they won’t turn around and recognize their responsibilities,” he said.“Okay, fine,” Deborah responded. “Go ahead and declare them. Maybe it’ll getbetter.”The oɽcial then granted Deborah permission to begin upper-level courseworkin Clearwater.In August 2006, a formal notice on yellow parchment, called a “goldenrod,”was posted at the Celebrity Centre declaring Deborah’s parents SuppressivePersons, explaining that they had withdrawn the money they had placed ondeposit for future coursework and that they had associated with “squirrels”—that is, they received unauthorized Scientology counseling. A month later, MaryBenjamin sent her daughter a letter. “We tried to do what you asked, Deborah.We worked the whole months of July & Aug. on A-E.” They gave the churchback the $2,500 for the courses that they never intended to take. After all that,she continued, a church adjudicator had told them to hand out three hundredcopies of L. Ron Hubbard’s booklet “The Way to Happiness” to libraries and todocument each exchange with photographs. Her parents had had enough. “If thiscan’t be resolved, we will have to say Good-Bye to you & James will lose hisGrand-Parents,” her mother wrote. “This is ridiculous.”In April 2007, Deborah received a letter from the lawyer who represented herparents, threatening a lawsuit for the right to visit their grandson. Deborah hadto hire an attorney. Eventually, the church relented. Deborah was summoned tothe Celebrity Centre and shown a statement rescinding the decision, althoughshe wasn’t allowed to have a copy of it.WHILE HE WAS RESEARCHING on the Internet, Haggis came upon a series of articlesthat had run in the St. Petersburg Times3 beginning in June 2009, titled “TheTruth Rundown.” The paper has maintained a special focus on Scientology, sincethe church maintains such a commanding presence in Clearwater, which isadjacent to St. Petersburg. Although the paper and the church have frequentlybeen at odds, the only interview that David Miscavige has ever given to anewspaper resulted in a rather ɻattering proɹle in the Times in 1998. (Sincethen, Miscavige has not spoken to the press at all.)In the series, Haggis learned for the ɹrst time that several of the top managersof the church had quietly defected—including Marty Rathbun. For several years,the word in the Scientology community was that Rathbun had died of cancer.Mike Rinder, the chief spokesperson, and Tom De Vocht, the former landlord of"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"all the church properties in Clearwater, were also speaking out about the abusesthat were taking place inside the top tier of management—mainly at the handsof the church leader. Amy Scobee, who had overseen the Celebrity Centre in LosAngeles, pointed out that the reason no one outside of the executive circlesknew of the abuse, even other Scientologists like Haggis, was that people wereterriɹed of Miscavige—and not just physically. Their greatest fear wasexpulsion. “You don’t have any money. You don’t have job experience. Youdon’t have anything. And he could put you on the streets and ruin you.”Tommy Davis had produced nine senior church executives who told the Timesthat the abuse had never taken place. Dan Sherman, the church’s oɽcialHubbard biographer and Miscavige’s speechwriter, recounted a scene in whichhe observed Miscavige talking to an injured sparrow. “It was immenselytender,” Sherman told the reporters.Much of the abuse being alleged had taken place at Gold Base. Haggis hadvisited the place only once, in the early 1980s, when its existence was still aclosely held secret. That was when he was preparing to direct the Scientologycommercial that was ultimately rejected. At ɹrst glance, it seemed like a spa,beautiful and restful; but he had been put oʃ by the uniforms, the security, andthe militarized feel of the place.“At the top of the church, people were whacking folks about like Laurel andHardy,” Haggis said. He was embarrassed to admit that he had never even askedhimself where Rathbun and Rinder had gone. He decided to call Rathbun, whowas now living on Galveston Bay in South Texas. Although the two men hadnever met, they were well known to each other. After being one of the mostpowerful ɹgures in Scientology, Rathbun was scraping together a living byfreelancing stories to local newspapers and selling beer at a ballpark. He ɹguredthat South Texas was about as far from Los Angeles and Clearwater as he couldhope to get. Haggis was ɻoored when he learned that Rathbun had had toescape. He was also surprised to learn that other friends, such as Jim Logan, theman who brought him into the church so long ago on the street corner inOntario, had also ɻed or been declared Suppressive Persons. One of Haggis’sclosest friends in the church hierarchy, Bill Dendiu, told Haggis that he hadescaped from Gold Base by driving a car—actually, an Alfa Romeo convertiblethat Haggis had sold him—through the fence. He still had scars on his foreheadto show for that.“What kind of organization are we involved in where people just disappear?”Haggis wondered.He also came across a number of anti-Scientology websites, including"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Exscientologykids.com, which was created by Jenna Miscavige Hill, the leader’sniece, who joined the Sea Org when she was twelve. For her and many others,formal education had stopped when they entered the organization, leaving themill prepared for life outside the church. Jenna says that for much of her earlylife, she was kept in a camp with other Sea Org children and little adultsupervision. They rarely saw their parents. “We ran ourselves completely,” sherecalled.For several years, Haggis had been working with a charity he established toset up schools in Haiti. These stories reminded him of the child slaves he hadencountered in that country. “They were ten, twelve years old, signing billion-year contracts—and their parents go along with this!” he said of the Sea Orgchildren. “And they work morning, noon and night.... Scrubbing pots, manuallabor—that so deeply touched me. My God, it horrified me!”AFTER TOM CRUISE’S BEHAVIOR on Oprah and the Today show, Sumner Redstone, thechairman of Viacom, which owns Paramount Studios, chose not to renewCruise’s deal. “He turned oʃ all women,” Redstone explained. “He wasembarrassing the studio. And he was costing us a lot of money.” Cruise and hislongtime producing partner, Paula Wagner, worked out a deal with MGM toresurrect the struggling United Artists studio. Soon after that, Wagnerapproached Haggis, oʃering him a very generous deal. He wrote one script forthem, a big-budget children’s movie, but the studio was so ɹnancially pressedthat it couldn’t afford to produce it.In January 2008, just as it seemed that the derision that was directed atCruise was about to die down, a video was posted on the Internet. It was ataped interview with the star that preceded his acceptance of the FreedomMedal of Valor four years earlier. Wearing a black turtleneck, with the thememusic from Mission: Impossible playing in the background, Cruise spoke toScientologists in language they understood. “Being a Scientologist, you can lookat someone and know absolutely that you can help them,” Cruise said. “So forme it really is KSW, and it’s something that I don’t mince words with that—withanything!—but that policy with me has really gone—phist!” He made a vigorousgesture. “Boy! There’s a time I went through when I said, you know what, whenI read it I just went pooh! That’s it! That’s exactly it!”The video was placed on YouTube and viewed by millions who had no ideawhat he was talking about. Cruise’s urgency came oʃ as the ravings of a wild-eyed fanatic, but to Scientologists it was a sermon they had heard many times."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"“KSW” refers to a policy letter that Hubbard wrote in 1965 titled “KeepingScientology Working.” In the letter Hubbard reprimanded his followers forstraying from the narrow path he had laid out for them. “When somebody enrols[sic], consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe—neverpermit an ‘open-minded’ approach,” Hubbard writes. “If they’re aboard, they’rehere on the same terms as the rest of us—win or die in the attempt.” Hubbardconcludes: “The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman andChild on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years dependon what you do here and now with and in Scientology.”The church instantly began taking down the video from the Internet,threatening lawsuits because of copyright violations. A loose coalition ofInternet hackers who called themselves Anonymous seized on the issue. “Wewere a bunch of kids who didn’t care about anything,” Gregg Housh, acomputer-repair technician in Boston who acts as an unoɽcial spokesperson forthe group, recalled. Until then, they had never protested anything, but theyconsidered the Internet their turf and were oʃended that the church wouldattempt to control what they watched. In truth, they knew little aboutScientology, but the more they learned, the more aroused they became.“We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantlethe Church of Scientology in its present form,” Anonymous declared in a creepyvideo of its own. “We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We donot forget. Expect us.” Some members of the Anonymous coalition wageddenial-of-service attacks on church computers, shutting down their websites foran extended period. On February 10, 2008, Anonymous organized protests infront of Scientology churches and missions in a hundred cities across the world.Many of the demonstrators were wearing what has now become the signature ofthe Anonymous movement—the Guy Fawkes mask, taken from the ɹlm V forVendetta.At the center of the controversy was the beleaguered Tom Cruise. Anunɻattering, unauthorized biography by the British writer Andrew Morton waspublished days after the YouTube video of Cruise appeared, creating a newround of headlines—“Cruise Out of Control,” “Explosive Claims on CruiseBaby,” “German Historian Likens Cruise Speech to Goebbels”—that wereintensely personal and insulting. Questions of his religion, his sexual orientation,his relationship with his wife, even the paternity of his daughter were laid outlike a banquet for public consumption. Several top executives at United Artists,including Cruise’s partner, Paula Wagner, decided to leave.Haggis was in his oɽce in Santa Monica when he got a call from Cruise. He"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"hadn’t heard a word from him since writing the apology for his wisecrack toSpielberg. Haggis still had his deal at United Artists, which Cruise was running.Now the star had a favor to ask. He wanted to gather a group of topScientologists in Hollywood—Kirstie Alley, Anne Archer, and Haggis—to go onOprah or Larry King Live to denounce the attacks on Cruise as religiouspersecution. Haggis told Cruise that was a terrible idea. He said that Cruiseshould stop trying to be a mouthpiece for the church and go back to doing whathe does best—being a movie star. People love him for that, not for having theanswers to all of life’s problems. He also advised the star to have a sense ofhumor about himself—something that is often lacking in Scientology. Instead ofconstantly going on the attack, he might simply say, “Yeah, I get that it soundscrazy, but it works for me.”4Cruise didn’t want to hear what Haggis had to say at the time, but soon afterthis conversation, he took a wildly comic turn in the Ben Stiller ɹlm TropicThunder, playing a profane studio executive who reminded a number ofHollywood insiders of Sumner Redstone. He also went back on the Today showfor another interview with Matt Lauer. This time, he was chastened andintrospective. “I came across as arrogant,” he admitted, when reɻecting on theirprevious interview three years earlier. “That’s not who I am. That’s not theperson I am.... I’m here to entertain people. That’s who I am and what I want todo.” Outside the windows of the studio, a crowd of people in the plaza ofRockefeller Center waved and blew kisses.HAGGIS WAS CASTING The Next Three Days in the summer of 2009, and he askedJason Beghe to read for the part of a detective. Beghe’s best-known ɹlm rolewas as the love interest for Demi Moore in G.I. Jane. In the late nineties, whenHaggis had worked with the gravel-voiced actor on a CBS series, Family Law,Beghe had been an occasional front man for Scientology. He had come to thechurch, like so many others, through the Beverly Hills Playhouse. In oldpromotional materials for the church, Beghe is quoted as saying that Scientologyis “a rocket ride to spiritual freedom.” He says that Miscavige once called him“the poster boy for Scientology.”"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Paul Haggis on the set of The Next Three Days, in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, train yard“I just want you to know I’m no longer in Scientology,” Beghe told Haggiswhen he called. “Actually, I’m one of its most outspoken critics. The churchwould be very unhappy if you hire me.”“Nobody tells me who I cast,” Haggis responded, but he decided to look at thelengthy video Beghe had posted on the Internet, in which he denounces thechurch as “destructive and a rip-oʃ.” Haggis thought the actor had gone over theedge, but he asked if they could talk.The two men met at Patrick’s Roadhouse, a pleasantly shabby coʃee shop onthe Paciɹc Coast Highway. Beghe was calmer than he had been in the video,which he now called “a snapshot of me having been out only three months.” Hecould see that Haggis was troubled. Even though Beghe had renounced thechurch, he continued to use Scientology when dealing with former members. Inhis several meetings with Haggis, he employed techniques based on Hubbard’sEthics Conditions. These range from Confusion at the bottom and ascend"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"through Treason, Enemy, Doubt, Liability, Emergency, and so on, up to Power.Each of the conditions has a speciɹc set of steps to follow in order to advance toa higher state. Assuming that Haggis was in the condition of Doubt, Beghe knewthat the proper formula required him to provide information.He told Haggis that in the late nineties he began having emotional problems.The church prescribed more auditing and coursework. In retrospect, Beghe feltthat it had done no good. “I was paying money for them to fuck me up,” he said,estimating that he had spent as much as $600,000 in the process, and nearly $1million in his thirteen-year Scientology career. When he ɹnally decided to leavethe church, he told Tommy Davis that the church was in a condition of Liabilityto him. Ordinarily, when a Scientologist does something wrong, especiallysomething that might damage the image of the organization, he has to makeamends, often in the form of a substantial contribution. But now the situationwas reversed, Beghe maintained. He proposed that the church buy someproperty and lease it to him at a negligible rate. “You guys don’t have anypolicies to make up the damage, so I’m doing this for your own good—and formine,” he explained to Davis and others. “Because I don’t have a policy of takingit in the ass.”5While talking to Haggis, Beghe was reluctant to use the word“brainwashing”—“whatever the fuck that is”—but he did say that somehow hismind had been taken over. “You have all these thoughts, all these ways oflooking at things, that are L. Ron Hubbard’s,” he explained. “You think you’rebecoming more you, but within that is an implanted thing, which is You theScientologist.”Haggis was disturbed by Beghe’s account of what had happened after he leftthe church. He claimed that none of his Scientology friends would talk to him,his son had been kicked out of school, he was being followed by privateinvestigators and threatened with lawsuits. Perhaps because Haggis had neverbeen as much of a true believer as some members, he didn’t nurse the samesense of betrayal. “I didn’t feel that some worm had buried itself in my ear, andif you plucked it out you would ɹnd L. Ron Hubbard and his thought,” he said.But he did feel that he had been cautioned.“TOMMY,” HAGGIS’S LETTER of August 19, 2009, abruptly begins. “As you know, forten months now I have been writing to ask you to make a public statementdenouncing the actions of the Church of Scientology of San Diego. Their publicsponsorship of Proposition 8, which succeeded in taking away the civil rights of"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"gay and lesbian citizens of California—rights that were granted them by theSupreme Court of our state—is a stain on the integrity of our organization and astain on us personally. Our public association with that hate-ɹlled legislationshames us.”The tone of the letter is both aggrieved and outraged, mixing Haggis’spersonal experiences with the results of his one-man investigation into thechurch. He mentions how Katy Haggis’s friends had turned against her when shecame out to them as a lesbian. Katy had told him that another friend of hers hadapplied to be the assistant for Jenna and Bodhi Elfman, the Scientology actingcouple. Lauren Haigney, Tom Cruise’s niece in the Sea Org, had been assigned tovet the applicants. Katy says that Lauren wrote up a report saying that Katy’sfriend was known to hang out with lesbians. The friend did not get the job, Katysaid.6Haggis also recounted the scene at John Travolta and Kelly Preston’s house,when another Scientologist made the slur about the gay waiter. “I admire Johnand Kelly for many reasons; one of them is the way they handled that,” Haggisstated. “You and I both know there has been a hidden anti-gay sentiment in thechurch for a long time. I have been shocked on too many occasions to hearScientologists make derogatory remarks about gay people, and then quote LRHin their defense.” He said that the church’s decision not to denounce the bigotswho supported Proposition 8 was cowardly. “Silence is consent, Tommy. Irefuse to consent.”He referenced Davis’s interview on CNN. “I saw you deny the church’s policyof disconnection. You said straight-out there was no such policy, that it did notexist,” he wrote. “I was shocked. We all know this policy exists. I didn’t have tosearch for verification. I didn’t have to look any further than my own home.” Hereminded Davis of Deborah’s experience with her parents. “Although it causedher terrible personal pain, my wife broke oʃ all contact with them.... That’s notancient history, Tommy. It was a year ago.” He added: “To see you lie so easily,I am afraid to ask myself: what else are you lying about?”Then, he said, he had read the series of articles in the St. Petersburg Times.“They left me dumbstruck and horriɹed. These were not the claims made by‘outsiders’ looking to dig up dirt against us. These accusations were made by topinternational executives who had devoted most of their lives to the church. Saywhat you will about them now, these were staunch defenders of the church,including Mike Rinder, the church’s official spokesman for 20 years!“Tommy, if only a fraction of these accusations are true, we are talking aboutserious, indefensible human and civil rights violations.”"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"He continued:And when I pictured you assuring me that it is all lies, that this is nothing but an unfounded andvicious attack by a group of disgruntled employees, I am afraid that I saw the same face that looked inthe camera and denied the policy of disconnection. I heard the same voice that professed outrage at oursupport of Proposition 8, who promised to correct it, and did nothing.I was left feeling outraged, and frankly, more than a little stupid.Haggis was especially disturbed by the way the church’s Freedom magazinehad responded to the newspaper’s revelations. It included a lengthy annotatedtranscript of conversations that had taken place prior to the publication of theseries between the Times reporters, Joe Childs and Thomas C. Tobin, andrepresentatives of the church, including Tommy Davis and Jessica Feshbach, thetwo international spokespersons for the church. In the Freedom account, thenames of the defectors were never actually stated, perhaps to shieldScientologists from the shock of seeing familiar ɹgures such as Marty Rathbunand Amy Scobee publicly denouncing the organization and its leader. Rathbunwas called “Kingpin” and Amy Scobee “The Adulteress.” At one point in theconversation, Davis had told reporters that Scobee had been expelled from thechurch because she had had an aʃair. The reporters responded that she haddenied any sexual contact outside her marriage. “That’s a lie,” Davis told them.Feshbach, who carried a stack of documents, then said, “She has a writtenadmission [of] each one of her instances of extramarital indiscretions.... Ibelieve there were five.”When Haggis read this, he immediately assumed that the church had gotten itsinformation from auditing sessions.7 He was inɻamed. “A priest would go to jailbefore revealing secrets from the confessional, no matter what the cost tohimself or his church,” he wrote. “You took Amy Scobee’s most intimateadmissions about her sexual life and passed them on to the press and thensmeared them all over the pages of your newsletter!...This is the woman whojoined the Sea Org at 16! She ran the entire celebrity center network, and was aloyal senior executive of the church for what, 20 years?” He added that he wasaware that the church might do the same to him. “Well, luckily, I have neverheld myself up to be anyone’s role model.”Haggis concluded:The great majority of Scientologists I know are good people who are genuinely interested in improvingconditions on this planet and helping others. I have to believe that if they knew what I now know, they"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"too would be horriɹed. But I know how easy it was for me to defend our organization and dismiss ourcritics, without ever truly looking at what was being said; I did it for thirty-ɹve years.... I am onlyashamed that I waited this many months to act. I hereby resign my membership in the Church ofScientology.AT THE TIME Haggis was doing his investigation, the FBI was also looking intoScientology. In December 2009, Tricia Whitehill, a special agent from the LosAngeles oɽce, ɻew to Florida to interview former members of the church at thebureau’s office in downtown Clearwater, which happens to be directly across thestreet from Scientology’s spiritual headquarters. Tom De Vocht, who spoke toWhitehill then, got the impression that the investigation had been going on forquite a while. He says that Whitehill conɹded that she hadn’t told the localagents what the investigation was about, in case the oɽce had been inɹltrated.Amy Scobee also spoke to Whitehill for two full days, mainly about the abuseshe had witnessed.Whitehill and Valerie Venegas, the lead agent on the case, also interviewedformer Sea Org members in California. One was Gary Morehead, who haddeveloped the blow drill. He explained how his security team would useemotional and psychological pressure to bring escapees back; but failing that,physical force has been used.8Whitehill and Venegas worked on a special task force devoted to humantraɽcking. The laws regarding traɽcking were built largely around forcedprostitution, but they also pertain to slave labor. Under federal law, slavery isdeɹned, in part, by the use of coercion, torture, starvation, imprisonment,threats, and psychological abuse. The California Penal Code lists severalindicators that someone may be a victim of human traɽcking: signs of traumaor fatigue; being afraid or unable to talk because of censorship or securitymeasures that prevent communication with others; working in one place withoutthe freedom to move about; owing a debt to one’s employer; and not havingcontrol over identiɹcation documents. Those conditions resemble the accountsof many former Sea Org members who lived at Gold Base. If proven, thoseallegations would still be diɽcult to prosecute given the religious status ofScientology.Marc Headley escaped from Gold Base in 2005; he says this was after beingbeaten by Miscavige.9 His defection was especially painful for the church,because Marc says he was the ɹrst person Tom Cruise audited. In Scientology,the auditor bears a signiɹcant responsibility for the progress of his subject. “Ifyou audit somebody and that person leaves the organization, there’s only one"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"person whose fault that is—the auditor,” Headley explained. Later that year,Marc’s wife, Claire, also escaped. In 2009, they sued the church, claiming thatthe working conditions at Gold Base violated labor and human-traɽcking laws.The church responded that the Headleys were ministers who had voluntarilysubmitted to the rigors of their calling, and that the First Amendment protectedScientology’s religious practices. The court agreed with this argument anddismissed the Headleys’ complaints, awarding the church forty thousand dollarsin litigation costs.In April 2010, John Brousseau also ɻed. He, too, represented a dangerousliability to the church. He had been a Sea Org member for decades; he hadworked personally for Hubbard; and he knew Miscavige intimately. But whatwas of most concern to the church was the fact that he had worked on oroverseen numerous special projects for Tom Cruise. None of these unique andcostly gifts come anywhere close to the millions of dollars that the star hasdonated to the church over the years, but they do call into question the privatebenefit afforded a single individual by a tax-exempt religious organization.Brousseau knew the lengths to which the church would go in order to ɹnd himand bring him back. He drove to Carson City, Nevada, and bought a netbookcomputer at a Walmart, along with an air card, then set up an encrypted e-mailaccount. He sent a note to Rathbun, saying, “I just left and I’m freaked out, andI’ve got nowhere to go.” Rathbun invited him to South Texas. Expecting that thechurch would have hired private detectives to stake out key intersections on theinterstate highways, Brousseau stuck to county roads. It took him three days tomake it to Texas. He was driving a black Ford Excursion, much like the one thathe had fashioned into a limousine for Cruise.Brousseau and Rathbun met at a Chili’s restaurant near Corpus Christi. Theydecided to hide Brousseau’s truck at a friend’s house. Rathbun then checkedBrousseau into a Best Western motel under a diʃerent name. Despite theprecautions, two days later, at ɹve thirty in the morning, when Brousseau wentout on the balcony to smoke, he heard a door open nearby and footstepswalking toward him. It was Tommy Davis and three other church members.“Hey, J.B.,” Davis said. “You got yourself in some shit.”Brousseau turned and walked away.“Where are you going?” Davis demanded.Brousseau said he was going to get some coʃee. Davis and the Scientologydelegation followed behind him. The Circle K across the street wasn’t open yet,so Brousseau went into the motel lobby. He told the receptionist, “Call thepolice. These guys are stalking me.”"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"She laughed in disbelief.“We’ve got a room here, too,” Davis said.Brousseau said he needed to go to the bathroom. As soon as he got back to hisroom he bolted the door and called Rathbun. “Marty, they came for me,” hesaid.After calling 911, Rathbun jumped in his truck to go to the motel, but fourcars ɹlled with Scientologists blocked his way. He says they were led byMichael Doven, Cruise’s former personal assistant.Brousseau waited in his room until the police oɽcers arrived. Davis and theothers left empty-handed.10Brousseau talked to Whitehill and Venegas at the FBI. He was under theimpression that the federal agents were considering a raid on Gold Base.Brousseau says he was shown high-resolution photos of the base taken from adrone aircraft. He says he was told that they had even gathered the tail numberson Tom Cruise’s aircraft, in case Miscavige tried to escape. Brousseau and othersclaim to have discouraged the idea, saying that such a raid would turn Miscavigeinto a martyr; and, in any case, no one would testify against him. Rinder toldthe agents it would be a waste of time, because everyone would tell them theirlives are all “seashells and butterɻies.” The investigation was reportedlydropped.11AFTER SENDING COPIES of his resignation letter to his closest friends in Scientology,Haggis wasn’t surprised when he came home from work a few days later to ɹndnine or ten of them standing in his front yard. “I can’t imagine why you’rehere,” he joked, but he invited them to sit on the back porch and talk. AnneArcher and her husband, Terry Jastrow, an Emmy-winning producer for ABCSports, were there. Mark Isham, a composer who worked with Haggis for years,came with his wife, Donna. Sky Dayton, the founder of EarthLink and BoingoWireless, joined them, along with several other friends and a representative ofthe church that Haggis didn’t know. His friends could have served as anadvertisement for Scientology—they were wealthy high achievers with solidmarriages who exuded a sense of spiritual well-being.Scientologists are trained to believe in their persuasive powers and the needto keep a positive frame of mind. But the mood on Haggis’s porch was downbeatand his friends’ questions were full of reproach.“Do you have any idea that this might damage a lot of wonderfulScientologists?” Jastrow asked. “It’s such a betrayal of our group.”"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Haggis responded that he didn’t mean to be critical of Scientology. “I loveScientology,” he said. Everyone knew about Haggis’s ɹnancial support of thechurch and the occasions when he had spoken out in its defense. He remindedhis friends that he had been with them at the Portland Crusade, when he hadbeen drafted to write speeches.Archer had a particular reason to feel aggrieved: Haggis’s letter had called herson a liar. She could understand the pain and anger Haggis felt over thetreatment of his own gay daughters, but she didn’t think that was relevant. Inher opinion, homosexuality is not the church’s issue. She had personallyintroduced gay friends to Scientology.Isham was especially frustrated. He felt that they weren’t breaking through toHaggis. Of all the friends present, Isham was the closest to Haggis. They had acommon artistic sensibility that made it easy to work together. Isham had wonan Emmy for the theme music he composed for Haggis’s 1996 television series,EZ Streets. He had scored Crash and Haggis’s last movie, The Valley of Elah. Soonhe was supposed to start work on The Next Three Days. Now both theirfriendship and their professional relationship were at risk.Isham had been analyzing the discussion from a Scientological perspective. Inhis view, Haggis’s emotional state on the Tone Scale at that moment was a 1.1,Covertly Hostile. By adopting a tone just above it—Anger—he hoped to blastHaggis out of the psychic place where he seemed to be lodged. Isham madewhat he calls an intellectual decision to be angry.“Paul, I’m pissed off,” he told Haggis. “There are better ways to do this. If youhave a complaint, there’s a complaint line.” Anyone who genuinely wanted tochange Scientology should stay within the organization, Isham argued, not quit.All of his friends believed that if he wanted to change Scientology, he should doit from within. They wanted him to recant and return to the fold or elsewithdraw his letter and walk away without making a fuss.Haggis listened patiently. A fundamental tenet of Scientology is that diʃeringpoints of view must be fully heard and acknowledged. But when his friendsɹnished, they were still red-faced and angry. Haggis suggested that as goodScientologists, they should at least examine the evidence. He referred them tothe St. Petersburg Times articles that had so shaken him, and to certain websiteswritten by former members. He explained that his quarrel was with themanagement and the culture of the church, not with Scientology itself. Bycopying them on his resignation letter, he had hoped that they would be ashorriɹed as he by the practices that were going on in the name of Scientology.Instead, he realized, they were mainly appalled by his actions in calling the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"management of the church to account.Haggis’s friends came away from the meeting with mixed feelings—“noclearer than when we went in,” Archer felt. What wasn’t said in this meetingwas that this would be the last time any of them would ever speak to Haggis.Isham did consider Haggis’s plea to look at the websites or the articles in the St.Petersburg Times, but he decided “it was like reading Mein Kampf if you wantedto know something about the Jewish religion.”After that ɹrst meeting with friends on his back porch, Haggis had severallengthy encounters with Tommy Davis and other representatives of the church.They showed up at his oɽce in Santa Monica—a low-slung brick building onBroadway, covered in graɽti, like a gang headquarters. The oɽcials broughtthick ɹles to discredit people they heard or assumed he had been talking to. Thiswas August 2009; shooting for The Next Three Days in Pittsburgh was going tostart within days, and the oɽce desperately needed Haggis’s attention. Hisproducing partner, Michael Nozik, who is not a Scientologist, was frustrated.Haggis was spending hours, day after day, dealing with Scientology delegations.He resorted to getting members of his staʃ to walk him out to his car becausehe knew that Scientology executives would be waiting for him, and he wantedto give the impression he was too busy to speak—which he was. But then hewould give up and let them into the office for another lengthy confrontation.During one of these meetings, Davis showed Haggis a policy letter thatHubbard had written, listing the acts for which one could be declared aSuppressive Person. Haggis had stepped over the line on four of them.“Tommy, you are absolutely right, I did all those things,” Haggis responded.“If you want to call me that, that’s what I am.”“We can still put this genie back in the bottle,” Tommy assured him, but itwould mean that Haggis would withdraw the letter and then resign quietly.Although Haggis listened, he didn’t change his mind. It seemed to him that theScientology oɽcials became more “livid and irrational” the longer they talked.For instance, Davis and the other church oɽcials insisted that Miscavige had notbeaten his employees; his accusers, they said, had committed the violence.“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Haggis responded, “okay, let’s say that’s true, Miscavigenever touched anyone. I’m sorry, but if someone in my organization were goingaround beating people, I’d know about it! You think I’d put up with it? And I’mnot that good a person.” Haggis noted that if the rumors about Miscavige’sviolent temper were true, it just proved that even the greatest leaders arefallible. “Look at Martin Luther King, Jr.,” he said, referring to one of hisheroes. “If you look at his personal life, it’s been said he has a few problems in"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"that area.”“How dare you compare Dave Miscavige with Martin Luther King!” one of theofficials shouted.Haggis was aghast. “They thought that comparing Miscavige to Martin LutherKing was debasing his character,” he said. “If they were trying to convince methat Scientology was not a cult, they did a very poor job of it.”12Copies of Haggis’s e-mail resignation letter were forwarded to variousmembers of the church, although few outside of church circles knew about it. ByOctober, the letter had found its way to Marty Rathbun. He had become aninformal spokesperson for Scientology defectors who, like him, believed that thechurch had broken away from Hubbard’s original teachings. He called Haggis,who was shooting in Pittsburgh, and asked if he could publish the letter on hisblog. “You’re a journalist, you don’t need my permission,” Haggis said, althoughhe did ask him to excise the portion of the letter that dealt with his dinner withJohn Travolta and Kelly Preston and the part about his daughter Katy’shomosexuality.Haggis didn’t think about the consequences of his decision. He thought itwould show up on a couple of websites. He was a writer, not a movie star. ButRathbun got fifty-five thousand hits on his blog that afternoon.The next morning, the story was in newspapers around the world. Haggis gota call from Tommy Davis. “Paul, what the hell!”1 Four years before, the church had actively campaigned against Proposition 63, the Mental Health ServicesAct, which raised taxes to provide for increased care for the mentally ill; the proposition passed.2 Mary Benjamin says they were never parties to the suit.3 Now called the Tampa Bay Times.4 Cruise’s attorney, Bertram Fields, denies this took place: “Mr. Cruise has never asked Mr. Haggis or anyoneelse to denounce media attacks on Mr. Cruise on the Larry King show or anywhere else or to do anythinglike that.”5 The church characterizes this as an attempt at extortion.6 The church forwarded a letter to me from Katy Haggis’s friend in which she denies losing a job because oftheir friendship and asserting that the church is welcoming to everyone, regardless of their sexualorientation. The friend, whose parents are both employed by the church, did not respond to a request to talkfurther.7 Tommy Davis gave me an aɽdavit, signed by Scobee, in which she admits to having liaisons. Scobee told"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"me there were only two incidents, both of which involved a kiss and nothing more. She says she did notwrite the aɽdavit; she says she only signed it in the hope of leaving the church on good terms so that shecould stay in touch with relatives. The church maintains that it does not use conɹdential informationderived from auditing sessions.8 The church denies that blow drills exist.9 According to Tommy Davis, “Mr. Miscavige has never physically assaulted Marc Headley or anyone else.”10 Davis later said that he had never followed a Sea Org member who had blown and had only gone to seeBrousseau because he was “a very good friend of mine” (Deposition of Thomas Davis, Marc Headley vs.Church of Scientology International, and Claire Headley vs. Church of Scientology International, US DistrictCourt, Central District of California, July 2, 2010).11 Valerie Venegas told one of her sources that higher-up oɽcials had spiked it; later, she blamed me,because I had uncovered the probe and had called to verify it with the agents (Tony Ortega, “FBIInvestigation of Scientology: Already Over before We Even Heard of It,” Village Voice Blogs, Mar. 19, 2012).12 Tommy Davis says that Martin Luther King, Jr.’s name never came up."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"W11Tommyhen I ɹrst contacted Davis in April 2010, asking for his cooperation ona proɹle I was writing about Haggis for The New Yorker, he expresseda reluctance to talk, saying that he had already spent a monthresponding to similar queries. “It made little diʃerence,” he said. “The last thingI’m interested in is dredging all this up again.” He kept putting me oʃ, sayingthat he was too busy to get together, although he promised that we would meetwhen he was more available. “I want our time to be undistracted,” he explainedin an e-mail. “We should plan on spending at least a full day together as there isa lot I would want to show you.” We ɹnally arranged to meet on Memorial Dayweekend.I ɻew to Los Angeles and spent much of that weekend waiting for him to call.On Sunday at three o’clock, Davis appeared at my hotel, with Jessica Feshbach.We sat at a table on the patio. Davis has his mother’s sleepy eyes. His thickblack hair was combed forward, with a lock falling boyishly onto his forehead.He wore a wheat-colored suit with a blue shirt that opened onto a chest thatseemed, among the sun-worshippers at the pool, strikingly pallid. Feshbach, aslender, attractive woman, anxiously twirled her hair.Davis now told me that he was “not willing to participate in, or contribute to,an article about Scientology through the lens of Paul Haggis.” I had come to LosAngeles speciɹcally to talk to him, at a time he had chosen. I wondered aloud ifhe had been told not to talk to me. He said no.“Maybe Paul shouldn’t have posted the letter on the Internet,” Feshbachinterjected. “There are all sorts of shoulda woulda coulda.” She said that she hadjust spoken to Mark Isham, the composer, whom I had interviewed. “He talkedto you about what are supposed to be our conɹdential scriptures.” That I wouldask about the church’s secret doctrines was oʃensive, she said. “It’s a two-waystreet happening,” she concluded.1“Everything I have to say about Paul, I’ve already said,” Davis declared. Heagreed to respond to fact-checking queries, however."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"THE GARDEN BEHIND Anne Archer and Terry Jastrow’s home in the Brentwoodneighborhood of Los Angeles is a peaceful retreat, ɹlled with olive trees andhummingbirds. A fountain gurgles beside the swimming pool. Jastrow wasrecounting his ɹrst meeting with Archer, in Milton Katselas’s class. His friendDavid Ladd, son of the Hollywood legend Alan Ladd, had invited him to visit. “Isaw this girl sitting next to Milton,” Jastrow recalled. “I said, ‘Who’s that?’ ”Archer smiled. There was a cool wind blowing in from the Paciɹc, and shedrew a shawl around her. “We were friends for about a year and a half beforewe had our first date,” she said. They were married in 1978.“Our relationship really works,” Jastrow said. “We attribute that essentially ahundred percent to applying Scientology.”The two spoke of the techniques that had helped them, such as never beingcritical of the other and never interrupting.Scientology “isn’t a ‘creed,’ ” Archer said. “These are basic natural laws oflife.” She described L. Ron Hubbard as “an engineer, not a faith healer,” whohad codified human emotional states, in order to guide the adept to higher levelsof existence—“to help a guy rise up the Tone Scale and feel a zest and a love forlife.”Jastrow had been an acolyte in an Episcopal church when he was studying atthe University of Houston, but doubts overwhelmed him. “I walked out in themiddle of communion,” he said. “I was an atheist for ten years. That was thecondition I was in when I started at the Beverly Hills Playhouse.” He had neverheard of Scientology at the time.Archer said that the controversy that continually surrounds the church hadn’ttouched her. “It’s not that I’m not aware of it.” She added that Scientology isgrowing despite the public criticism. “It’s in a hundred and sixty-five countries.”“Translated into ɹfty languages!” Jastrow interjected. “It’s the fastest-growingreligion.” In his opinion, “Scientologists do more good things for more people inmore places around the world than any other organization ever.” He added,“When you study historical perspective of new faiths, they’ve all been—”“Attacked,” said Archer. “Look at what happened to the—”“The Christians!” Jastrow said simultaneously. “Think of the Mormons andthe Christian Scientists.”They talked about the church’s focus on celebrities. “Hubbard recognized thatif you really want to inspire a culture to have peace and greatness and harmonyamong men, you need to respect and help the artist to prosper and ɻourish,”Archer said. “And if he’s particularly well known he needs a place where he canbe comfortable. So, Celebrity Centres provide that.” She blamed the press for"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"concentrating too much on Scientology celebrities. Journalists, she said, “don’twrite about the hundreds of thousands of other Scientologists.”“Millions!”“Millions of other Scientologists. They only write about four friggin’ people!”Jastrow suggested that Scientology’s critics often had a vested interest. Hepointed to psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, drug makers, pharmacies—“allthose people who make a living and proɹt and pay their mortgages and paytheir college educations and buy their cars, et cetera, et cetera, based on peoplenot being well.”“Who advertise in the newspapers and on television, more than any otheradvertisers,” Archer added.“But this is a collateral issue, darling, in terms of what I’m talking about,”Jastrow continued. “For the ɹrst time in America’s experience with war, thereare more mental illnesses from Iraq and Afghanistan than physical illnesses,” hesaid, citing a recent article in USA Today. “So mental illnesses become a bigbusiness.” Drugs merely mask mental distress, he said, whereas “Scientologywill solve the source of the problem.” The medical and pharmaceuticalindustries are “prime funders and sponsors of the media,” he said, and thereforemight exert “inɻuence on people telling the whole and true story aboutScientology just because of the proɹt motive.” He said that only Scientologycould help mankind right itself. “What else is there that we can hang our hopeson?”“That’s improving civilization,” Archer added.“Is there some other religion on the horizon that’s going to help mankind?”Jastrow asked. “Just tell me where. If not Scientology, where?”ANNE ARCHER BEGAN STUDYING with Katselas in 1974, two years after her sonTommy Davis was born. She was the exceptionally beautiful daughter of twosuccessful actors. Her father, John Archer, was best known during the 1930s and1940s as the voice introducing the radio drama The Shadow. (“Who knows whatevil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows,” he said at the beginning ofthe program.) He went on to appear in more than ɹfty ɹlms. Her mother,Marjorie Lord, played Danny Thomas’s wife on the popular television showMake Room for Daddy. With such a bloodline, it might be expected that Archerwould be aiming toward stardom, but when she entered the Beverly HillsPlayhouse she was coming oʃ a television series (Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice)that she didn’t respect and that had been canceled after a single season. She was"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"a young mother in a dissolving marriage and an actor with diminishing careerprospects.Katselas had a transformative eʃect. Like so many others, Archer wasmagnetized by this ebullient Greek, with his magniɹcent beard and hisbadgering, teasing, encouraging, and infuriating personality. He was one of themost inspiring people Archer had ever met. Where had he acquired suchwisdom? Some of the other students told her that Katselas was a Scientologist,so she decided to try it out. She began going two or three times a week to theCelebrity Centre to take the Life Repair Program. “I remember walking out ofthe building and walking down the street toward my car, and I felt like my feetwere not touching the ground. I said to myself, ‘My God, this is the happiest I’veever been in my entire life. I’ve ɹnally found something that works!’ ” Sheadded, “Life didn’t seem so hard anymore. I was back in the driver’s seat.”When Tommy was old enough, Archer would bring him to the Playhousewhile she was taking lessons. He would wander around the theater, venturinginto the light booth and watching his mother learning her craft. Jastrow recalledbeing struck by Tommy’s poise even as a ɹve-year-old child. “I am a really gooddad, and he taught me how,” Jastrow said. He gave the example of a visit fromhis own parents, who had ɻown out from Midland, Texas, to meet Terry’s newfamily. After Jastrow had driven them back to the airport, Tommy said, “Inotice that your dad was pretty strict with you.” Jastrow agreed that his fatherhad been very stern when he was growing up. Then Tommy continued, “I wasnoticing that you’re pretty strict with me.” Jastrow pointed to that as a deɹningmoment in their relationship. “I realized I wanted to be his friend ɹrst,” he said.“He was the senior being in that relationship.”Anne and Terry soon found their way into Scientology, but Tommy wasinitially raised in his mother’s original faith, Christian Science. His father,William Davis, is a wealthy ɹnancier and real-estate developer who was oncereported to be among the largest owners of agricultural property in California.He was also a well-known fund-raiser for Ronald Reagan and George H. W.Bush, and personally contributed an estimated $350,000 a year to Republicancauses. Although Tommy grew up in an environment of money and celebrity, heimpressed people with his modesty. He longed to do something to helphumanity. Scientology seemed to offer a direction.Paul Haggis met Tommy at the Celebrity Centre in 1989, when he wasseventeen years old—“a sweet and bright boy.” Their meeting came at a criticalmoment in Tommy’s life. He had just broken up with his girlfriend. Archer hadtaken him to the Celebrity Centre for counseling, where he took a course called"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Personal Values and Integrity.Tommy’s presence immediately caused a stir inside the church. The presidentof the Celebrity Centre, Karen Hollander, ɹxed on the idea that Tommy shouldbe her personal assistant. He was young, very rich, and handsome enough to bea movie star himself. He had grown up mixing with famous people. It would bea perfect ɹt. Whenever celebrities came in, there would be Anne Archer’s son.But that required coaxing Tommy to join the Sea Org. Hollander called in theyounger members of her staʃ to woo him. “You can either go to college and geta wog education, or you can join Sea Org and be doing the best service youcould ever do for mankind—and for yourself,” John Peeler, Hollander’ssecretary at the time, would tell him.Although Anne and Terry say they wanted Tommy to get a college education,they knew of the eʃorts to recruit him and didn’t stand in the way. That fall,Tommy entered Columbia University, but lasted only a single semester. OverChristmas break, he went back into Hollander’s oɽce, and when he came out,he excitedly told Peeler he had just signed the billion-year contract.His job for Hollander was to attend to the celebrities who lounged around thepresident’s oɽce. Lisa Marie Presley was often there, as were Kirstie Alley, andwriter-director Floyd Mutrux. John Travolta would drop by occasionally. Also inthis crowd was a clique of young actors who had grown up in the church,including Giovanni Ribisi and his sister Marissa, Jenna Elfman, and JulietteLewis. Davis would arrange for them all to go to movies together. He wascharming, attractive, he had a great sense of humor, and eventually, DavidMiscavige began to notice. “Miscavige liked the fact that he was young andlooked trendy and wore Brioni or Armani suits,” Mike Rinder observed. “He hada cute BMW. It was an image that Miscavige liked.”Davis moved into Sea Org berthing in a dodgy neighborhood on Wilcox Streetin West Hollywood. It was quite a step down from the luxurious life he hadenjoyed until then. He was quickly introduced to some of the inner secrets ofthe organization. In about 1994, he was involved in an embarrassing cover-upwhen a well-known spokesperson for the church was captured in a video havingsex with several other men. Amy Scobee says that church executives werefrantic that their spokesperson would be exposed as being gay. Scobee andKaren Hollander set a briefcase with the spokesperson’s auditing ɹles in thebackseat of the car that Hollander was borrowing at the time—actually, TommyDavis’s BMW—intending to take the ɹles to Gold Base the next day for seniormanagers to review. Because the car was in a highly secure parking lot, theythought nothing of it. Davis returned late that night, however. He found his car"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"and decided to take it back to the Sea Org dormitory. When he parked the caron Wilcox Street, he happened to notice the briefcase, so he locked it in thetrunk and went to bed.The next day, Scobee got a call from a sheepish Davis. He said that someonehad broken into his car and stolen the briefcase out of the trunk. “When we toldTommy what was in the briefcase, he freaked,” Scobee recalled. “He wentaround for a week, searching through Dumpsters.” Finally, someone approachedDavis about the reward he had oʃered and led him to the thief, a homeless manwho was trying to sell the briefcase; the contents, which were still in it, meantnothing to him. Davis gave the man twenty dollars.2 Davis was disappointedbecause the search forced him to miss the ceremony where John Travolta wasawarded a Scientology medal.Davis went through a period of doubt and actually considered dropping out ofthe Sea Org, according to Scobee, but then he recommitted and became soenthusiastic that he had the Sea Org logo—a laurel wreath with twenty-sixleaves representing the stars in the Galactic Confederacy—tattooed on his arm.When Miscavige found out, he berated Davis, saying that he had violated thechurch’s copyright.Davis began working with Marty Rathbun during his intensive auditing ofCruise. When Rathbun was thrown in the Hole, Davis became something morethan a gofer for the star. He provided a line to Cruise at a time when the actor’srelationship with the church was not yet solidiɹed, and his constant presencebeside the superstar boosted the image of Scientology as a hip, insider network.Although Cruise is ten years older, the two men physically resemble each other,with long faces and strong jaws, a likeness that is enhanced by similar spikyhaircuts. Their relationship evolved into a friendship, but one that reɻected theimmense power imbalance between them, as well as Davis’s position as a deputyof the church in the service of its most precious asset. Until his association withCruise, Davis had been called Tom, but he became Tommy to distinguish himfrom the star. In other ways, he became more like him—his clothes, his hair, hisintensity.At the age of nineteen, Davis married a dreamy Belgian woman, Nadine vanHootegem, who was also in the Sea Org. “I made the decision to forward theaims of Scientology,” she told the ABC News program 20/20 in 1998. “I actuallycompare it a little bit like Mother Teresa.” She added, “It’s a fun activity to setmen free.” According to Mike Rinder, Nadine Davis became intensely involvedin Tom Cruise’s entourage. “Somehow dealing with Katie Holmes, she didsomething wrong,” Rinder says. “She became a non-person.” He says that"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Tommy was forced to divorce her.3Soon after Cruise’s troubles in 2005, Tommy Davis was sent to Clearwater toparticipate in the Estates Project Force. Normally, the EPF functions as a kind ofboot camp for new Sea Org members. Donna Shannon was a veterinarian whohad risen to OT VII before signing her billion-year contract. She was surprised toɹnd that about half the people undergoing training were veteran Sea Orgmembers who were being disciplined, including Davis. He seemed like a niceguy, so she was puzzled that he was subjected to the worst hazing. “Hecomplained about being out scrubbing the Dumpster with a toothbrush till lateat night,” she recalled, “then he’d be up at six to do our laundry.” SometimesDavis would be paraded in front of the other Sea Org members as his EthicsOɽcer shouted, “This guy is not a big shot! He’s lying to you!” Only later didShannon learn that Davis was Anne Archer’s son. (As it happens, Archer was alsoat the Clearwater base, taking advanced courses. A teenage Sea Org member—Daniel Montalvo, the same one who guarded Cruise during his auditingsessions—was assigned to keep her in the dark and make sure that she neverencountered her son.)Shannon and Davis worked together, maintaining the grounds. “I wassupposedly supervising him,” Shannon said. “I was told to make him work reallyhard.” That didn’t seem to be a problem for Davis. At one point, Shannon said,he borrowed about a hundred dollars from her because he didn’t have money forfood.One day, Shannon and Davis were taking the bus to a work project. Shannonasked why he was in the EPF.“I got busted,” Davis told her. “I fucked up on Tom Cruise’s lines”—meaningthat he had botched a project Cruise was involved in.“So what are your plans now?” she asked.“I just want to do my stuff and get back on post,” Davis replied.Shannon said that suddenly “it was like a veil went over his eyes, and he goes,‘I already said too much.’ ”Several months later, Davis paid her back the money.4"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"Tommy DavisWhen Davis finished the EPF, he replaced Rinder as chief spokesperson for thechurch, because Rinder was conɹned to the Hole. One of his ɹrst assignmentswas to deal with John Sweeney, an aggressive reporter for the BBC, who wasdoing a story on Scientology and had been working with Rinder until then. Davismade the mistake of admitting to Sweeney that he reported to Miscavige everyday, spoiling the illusion of the leader as being unavailable and above the fray.Miscavige pulled Rinder out of the Hole and ordered him to help Davis dealwith the BBC, although he added, “You’re Tommy Davis’s servant.”Sweeney immediately sensed that Rinder had been demoted. Rinder was“gaunt, hollow-eyed, strange with a hint of niceness.” Tommy was now “the topdog, gleaming teeth, snappily suited, charming but creepily so.” When Sweeneyrefused to accede to the church’s restrictions (mainly that he agree not to usethe word “cult” in his report) and began independently reporting on theaccusations of defectors, he was shadowed by private investigators. AScientology ɹlm crew showed up to document the making of the BBCdocumentary. Cameras were pointed at cameras. Davis appeared unannouncedat Sweeney’s hotel and even traveled across the country to disrupt hisinterviews with Scientology dissidents. Sweeney had covered wars inAfghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya, but he had never had such emotional andpsychological pressure placed upon him. During these confrontations, Rinder"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"trailed behind Davis, staring blankly into space as Davis goaded the reporter,inches from his face. When Sweeney suggested that Scientology is a “sadisticcult,” Davis, wearing sunglasses, checked with his cameraman to see that thecamcorder was running, then said, “Now listen to me for a second. You have noright to say what is and what isn’t a religion. The Constitution of the UnitedStates of America guarantees one’s right to practice and believe freely in thiscountry. And the deɹnition of religion is very clear. And it’s not deɹned by JohnSweeney. For you to repeatedly refer to my faith in those terms is so derogatoryand so oʃensive and so bigoted. And the reason you kept repeating it is ’causeyou wanted a reaction like you’re getting right now. Well, buddy, you got it!Right here, right now, I’m angry! Real angry!”Davis turned and walked away, trailed by Sweeney, who protested, “It’s yourturn to listen to me! I’m a British subject.... ”Another confrontation took place at the “Psychiatry: An Industry of Death”exhibit in Hollywood. Davis once again moved in, nose to nose with Sweeney.“You’re accusing members of my religion of brainwashing!” He was referring toan earlier interview Sweeney had conducted with another Scientologist.“No, Tommy,” Sweeney responded, his voice rising, “you were not there—”“Brainwashing is a crime,” Davis said.“Listen to me! You were not there! At the beginning! Of the interview!”Sweeney shouted in an oddly slow cadence. “You did not hear! Or record! Theinterview!”“Do you understand that brainwashing is a crime?” Davis said, unfazed bySweeney’s enraged screams.Davis’s composure and his spirited defense of his church made quite a contrastwith the sputtering and eventually deeply chagrined reporter, who apologized toBBC viewers on the air.In March 2007, John Travolta’s new movie, Wild Hogs, a comedy about twomiddle-aged men who decide to become bikers, was scheduled to open inBritain. Concerned that Sweeney would confront Travolta during the publicityfor the ɹlm, Rinder and Davis planned to travel together to London, but on theday of departure, Davis failed to show up. Someone went to his room, but hewas nowhere to be found. Rinder had to travel to London alone. He learnedfrom Miscavige’s communicator that Davis had blown. Sweeney immediatelysensed that something was up and kept pestering Rinder about where Davis was.Rinder told him Davis had the flu.As part of the ɹlm promotion, Travolta arrived at the red-carpet Londonpremiere on a motorcycle. Sweeney was standing in the crowd in Leicester"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"Square, well away from the star, crying out, “Are you a member of a sinister,brainwashing cult?” Travolta’s fans shouted Sweeney down.Later, Sweeney asked Rinder if it was true that Miscavige had beaten him,claiming to have an eyewitness.“Who’s the witness?” Rinder asked.“He wishes to remain confidential because he says he is scared.”“John, that is typical of what you do,” Rinder said.“He says that David Miscavige knocked you to the ground.”“Absolute rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, not true, rubbish.”Rinder threatened to sue if Sweeney aired such allegations. When the BBCprogram ran, there was no mention of physical abuse. Rinder felt that he hadspared the church considerable embarrassment. But, far from being grateful,Miscavige told him that Sweeney’s piece should never have run at all. Heordered Rinder to report to an RPF facility in England. Rinder decided he’d hadenough. He blew.Davis called the church and returned voluntarily from Las Vegas, where hehad been hiding.5 He was sent to Clearwater, where he was security-checked byJessica Feshbach. The aim of the check is to gain a confession using an E-Meter.It can function as a powerful form of thought control.Davis and Feshbach subsequently married.ON A RAINY MORNING in late September 2010, I finally got my meeting with TommyDavis. The proɹle of Paul Haggis I had been preparing was nearing publication.Davis and Feshbach, along with four attorneys representing the church, traveledto Manhattan to meet with me; my editor, Daniel Zalewski, and David Remnick,the editor of The New Yorker; the two lead fact-checkers on the story, JenniferStahl and Tim Farrington, as well as the head of the magazine’s fact-checkingdepartment, Peter Canby; and our lawyer, Lynn Oberlander. Leading theScientology legal delegation was Anthony Michael Glassman, a former assistantUS attorney who now has a boutique law ɹrm in Beverly Hills, specializing inrepresenting movie stars. On his website, he boasts of a $10 million judgmentagainst The New York Times. The stakes were obvious to everyone.The Scientology delegation brought with them forty-eight three-ring binders ofsupporting material, stretching nearly seven linear feet, to respond to the 971questions the checkers had posed. It was an impressive display. The binderswere labeled according to categories, such as “Disappearance of L. RonHubbard,” “Tom Cruise,” “Gold Base,” and “Haggis’s Involvement in"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Scientology.” Davis emphasized that the church had gone to extraordinarylengths to prepare for this meeting. “Frankly, the only thing I can think thatcompares would be the presentation that we made in the early 1990s to theIRS.”We sat around a large blond conference table with the kaleidoscopic lights ofTimes Square garishly whirling in the background. I particularly recall theDunkin’ Donuts sign over Davis’s shoulder as he began his presentation. First, heruled out any discussion of the church’s conɹdential scripture. He compared it to“shoving an image of the Prophet Mohammed in the face of a Muslim” or“insisting that a Jew eat pork.” He then attacked the credibility of some of thesources for the piece, whom he called “bitter apostates.” “They are unreliable,”he said. “They make up stories.” He produced a paper by Bryan Wilson, whowas an eminent Oxford sociologist and prominent defender of new religiousmovements (he died in 2004). Wilson argues that testimony from disaʃectedmembers should be treated skeptically, noting, “The apostate is generally inneed of self-justiɹcation. He seeks to reconstruct his own past to excuse hisformer aɽliations and to blame those who were formerly his closest associates.... He is likely to be suggestible and ready to enlarge or embellish his grievancesto satisfy that species of journalist whose interest is more in sensational copythan in an objective statement of the truth.” Davis had highlighted the last partfor my benefit.As an example, Davis singled out Gerald Armstrong, the former Scientologyarchivist, who received an $800,000 settlement in a fraud suit against the churchin 1986. Davis charged that Armstrong had forged many of the documents thathe later disseminated in order to discredit the church’s founder, although heproduced no evidence to substantiate that allegation. He passed around aphotograph of Armstrong, which, he said, showed Armstrong “sitting naked”with a giant globe in his lap. “This was a photo that was in a newspaper articlehe did where he said that all people should give up money,” Davis said. “He’snot a very sane person.”6Davis also displayed photographs of what he said were bruises sustained byMike Rinder’s former wife in 2010, after Rinder physically assaulted her in aFlorida parking lot.7 Davis then showed a mug shot of Marty Rathbun in ajailhouse jumpsuit, after being detained in New Orleans in July 2010 for publicdrunkenness. “Getting arrested for being drunk on the intersection of Bourbonand Toulouse?” Davis cracked. “That’s like getting arrested for being a leper in aleper colony.” Other defectors, such as Claire and Marc Headley, were “the mostdespicable people in the world.” Jefferson Hawkins was “an inveterate liar.”"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"If these people were so reprehensible, I asked, how had they all arrived atsuch elevated positions in the church?“They weren’t like that when they were in those positions,” Davis replied.The defectors we were discussing had not only risen to positions ofresponsibility within the church; they had also ascended Scientology’s ladder ofspiritual accomplishment. I suggested that Scientology didn’t seem to beeʃective if people at the highest levels of spiritual attainment were actuallyliars, adulterers, wife beaters, drunks, and embezzlers.“This is a religion,” Davis responded movingly. “It aspires to greatness, hope,humanity, spiritual freedom. To be greater than we are. To rise above ourcraven, humanoid instincts.” Scientology doesn’t pretend to be perfect, he said,and it shouldn’t be judged on the misconduct of a few apostates. “I haven’t donethings like that,” Davis said. “I haven’t suborned perjury, destroyed evidence,lied—contrary to what Paul Haggis says.” He spoke of his frustration withHaggis after his resignation: “If he was so troubled and shaken on thefundamentals of Scientology ... then why the hell did he stick around for thirty-ɹve years?” He continued: “Did he stay a closet Scientologist for some career-advancement purpose?” Davis shook his head in disgust. “I think he’s the mosthypocritical person in the world.” He said he felt that he’d done all he could indealing with Haggis over the issue of Proposition 8. He added that the individualwho had made the mistake of listing the San Diego church as a supporter of theinitiative—he didn’t divulge his name—had been “disciplined” for it. I askedwhat that meant. “He was sat down by a staʃ member of the localorganization,” Davis explained. “He got sorted out.”Davis thought I was making too much out of the issue of Suppressive Personsin the piece. “Do you know how many people, grand total, there are in theworld who have been declared Suppressive?” he asked rhetorically. “A couple ofthousand over the years. At most.” He said that in fact many had been restoredto good standing. “Yet again, you’re falling into the trap of deɹning our religionby the people who’ve left.”Hubbard had said that only two and a half percent of the human populationwere suppressive, but one of the problems I faced in writing about Scientology,especially its early days, is that the preponderance of people who had been closeto Hubbard had either quietly left the church or been declared Suppressive.Some, like Pat Broeker, had gone underground. Many others, like David Mayo,had signed non-disclosure agreements. Those who remained in the church wereoff-limits to me.8We discussed the allegations of abuse lodged by many former members"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"against Miscavige. “The only people who will corroborate are their fellowapostates,” Davis said. “They’re a pack of sanctimonious liars.” He producedaɽdavits from other Scientologists refuting their accusations. He noted that inthe tales about Miscavige, the violence always seemed to come out of nowhere.“One would think that if such a thing occurred, which it most certainly did not,there’d have to be a reason,” Davis said.I had wondered about these outbursts as well. When Rinder and Rathbun werein the church, they claimed that allegations of abuse were baseless. Then, afterRinder defected, he said that Miscavige had beaten him ɹfty times. Rathbun hadtold the St. Petersburg Times in 1998 that in the twenty years he had workedclosely with Miscavige, he had never seen him hit anyone. “That’s not histemperament,” he had said. “He’s got enough personal horsepower that hedoesn’t need to resort to things like that.” Later, he acknowledged to the Times,“That’s the biggest lie I ever told you.” He has also confessed that in 1997 heordered incriminating documents destroyed in the case of Lisa McPherson, theScientologist who died of an embolism while under church care. If these menwere capable of lying to protect the church, might they not also be capable oflying to destroy it?However, eleven former Sea Org members told me that Miscavige hadassaulted them; twenty-two have told me or testiɹed in court that they havewitnessed one or more assaults on other church staʃ members by their leader.9Marc Headley, one of those who say Miscavige beat them on several occasions,said he knows thirty others who were attacked by the church leader. Rinder sayshe witnessed fourteen other executives who were assaulted, some on multipleoccasions, such as the elderly church president, Heber Jentzsch, who has been inthe Hole since 2006. Some people were slapped, others punched or kicked orchoked. Lana Mitchell, who worked in Miscavige’s oɽce, saw him hit hisbrother, Ronnie, in the stomach, during a meeting. Mariette Lindstein, who alsoworked in Miscavige’s oɽce, witnessed as many as twenty attacks. “You getvery hardened,” she admitted. She saw Miscavige banging the heads of two ofhis senior executives, Marc Yager and Guillaume Lesevre, together repeatedly,until blood came from Lesevre’s ear. Tom De Vocht says he witnessed Miscavigestriking other members of the staʃ about a hundred times. Others who neversaw such violence spoke of their constant fear of the leader’s wrath.The attacks often came out of the blue, “like the snap of a ɹnger,” as JohnPeeler described it. Bruce Hines, who was a senior auditor in 1994, told me thatbefore he was struck, “I heard his voice in the hallway, deep and distinctive,‘Where is that motherfucker?’ He looked in my oɽce. ‘There he is!’ Without"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"another word he came up and hit me with an open hand. I didn’t fall down. Itwas at that point I was put in RPF. I was incarcerated six years.”Davis admitted that the musical chairs episode occurred, even though thechurch denies the existence of the Hole, where it took place. He explained thatMiscavige had been away from Gold Base for some time, and when he returned,he found that many jobs had been reassigned without his permission. The gamewas intended to demonstrate how disruptive such wholesale changes could be onan organization. “All the rest of it is a bunch of embellishment and noise andhoo-haw,” Davis told me. “Chairs being ripped apart, and people beingthreatened that they’re going to be sent to far-ɻung places in the world, planetickets being purchased, and they’re going to force their spouses—and on and onand on. I mean, it’s just nuts!”The Scientology delegation objected to the negative tenor of The New Yorkerqueries about the church’s leader, including such small details as whether or nothe had a tanning bed. “I mean, this is The New Yorker. It sounds like the NationalEnquirer,” Davis complained. He wouldn’t say what Miscavige’s salary was (thechurch is not required to publicly disclose that information), but he derided theidea that the church leader enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle. Miscavige, hecontended, doesn’t live on the ostentatious scale of many other religious leaders.“There’s no big rings. There’s no fancy silk robes,” he said. “There’s no mansion.There’s no none of that. None, none, none. Zero, zilcho, not.” As for theextravagant birthday presents given to the church leader, Davis said that it wastradition for Sea Org members to give each other gifts for their birthdays. It was“just obnoxious” for me to single out Miscavige.“It’s not true that he’s gotten for his birthday a motorcycle, ɹne suits, andleather jackets?” I asked.“I gave him a leather jacket once,” Davis conceded.“So it is true?” I asked. “A motorcycle, fine suits?”“I never heard that,” he responded. “And as far as ɹne suits, I’ve got someɹne suits. The church bought those.” In fact, he was wearing a beautiful custom-made suit, with actual buttonholes on the cuʃs. He explained that for IRSpurposes it was considered a uniform. When Sea Org members mix with thepublic, he explained, they dress appropriately. “It’s called Uniform K.”Davis declined to let me speak to Miscavige; nor would he or the othermembers of the group agree to talk about their own experiences with the churchleader.I asked about the leader’s missing wife, Shelly Miscavige. John Brousseau andClaire Headley believe that she was taken to Running Springs, near Big Bear,"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"California, one of several sites where Hubbard’s works are stored inunderground vaults. “She’ll be out of sight, out of mind until the day she dies,”Brousseau had predicted, “like Mary Sue Hubbard.”In the meeting, Tommy Davis told me, “I deɹnitely know where she is,” buthe wouldn’t disclose the location.Davis brought up Jack Parsons’s black magic society, which he assertedHubbard had inɹltrated. “He was sent in there by Robert Heinlein, who wasrunning oʃ-book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time.”Davis said that the church had been looking for additional documentation tosupport its claim. “A biography that just came out three weeks ago on BobHeinlein actually conɹrmed it at a level that we’d never been able to before,because of something his biographer had found.”The book Davis was referring to is the ɹrst volume of an authorized Heinleinbiography, by William H. Patterson, Jr. There is no mention there of Heinleinsending Hubbard to break up the Parsons ring. I wrote Patterson, asking if hisresearch supported the church’s assertion. He responded that Scientologists hadbeen the source of the claim in the first place, and that they provided him with aset of documents that supposedly backed it up. Patterson said that the materialdid not support the factual assertions the church was making. “I was unable tomake any direct connection of the facts of Heinlein’s life at the time to thatnarrative or any of its supporting documents,” Patterson wrote. (The bookreveals that Heinlein’s second wife, Leslyn, had an aʃair with Hubbard.Interestingly, given Hubbard’s condemnation of homosexuality, the wife chargedthat Heinlein had as well.)“Even those allegations from Sara Northrup,” Davis continued, mentioning thewoman who had been Parsons’s girlfriend before running oʃ with Hubbard. “Hewas never married to Sara Northrup. She ɹled for divorce in an eʃort to try andcreate a false record that she had been married to him.” He said that she hadbeen under a cloud of suspicion, even when she lived with Parsons. “It alwayshad been considered that she had been sent in there by the Russians,” he said. “Ican never pronounce her name. Her actual true name is a Russian name.” Daviswas referencing a charge that Hubbard once made when he was portraying hiswife as a Communist spy named Sara Komkovadamanov. “That was one of thereasons L. Ron Hubbard never had a relationship with her,” Davis continued.“He never had a child with her. He wasn’t married to her. But he did save herlife and pull her out of that whole black magic ring.” Davis described Sara as “acouple beers short of a six-pack, to use a phrase.” He included in the binders aletter from her, dated June 11, 1951, a few days before their divorce"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"proceedings:I, Sara Northrup Hubbard, do hereby state that the things I have said about L. Ron Hubbard in thecourts and the public prints have been grossly exaggerated or are entirely false.I have not at any time believed otherwise than that L. Ron Hubbard was a fine and brilliant man.She went on to say, “In the future I wish to lead a quiet and orderly existencewith my little girl far away from the enturbulating inɻuences which have ruinedmy marriage.” (Sara did live a quiet and orderly existence until her death, ofbreast cancer, in 1997. She explained why she made the tapes, in her lastmonths of life. “I’m not interested in revenge,” she said. “I’m interested in thetruth.”)The meeting with the Scientology delegation lasted all day. Sandwiches werebrought in. Davis and I discussed an assertion that Marty Rathbun had made tome about the OT III creation story. While Hubbard was in exile, Rathbun said,he wrote a memo suggesting an experiment in which ascending Scientologistsmight skip the OT III level—a memo Rathbun says that Miscavige had ordereddestroyed. “Of every allegation that’s in here,” Davis said, waving the bindercontaining fact-checking queries, “this one would perhaps be, hands down, theabsolutely, without question, most libelous.” He explained that the cornerstoneof the faith was the writings of the founder. “Mr. Hubbard’s material must beand is applied precisely as written,” Davis said. “It’s never altered. It’s neverchanged. And there probably is no more heretical or more horriɹc transgressionthat you could have in the Scientology religion than to alter the technology.”But hadn’t certain derogatory references to homosexuality found in someeditions of Hubbard’s books been changed after his death?Davis agreed that was so, but he maintained that “the current editions areone-hundred-percent, absolutely fully veriɹed as being according to what Mr.Hubbard wrote.” Davis said they were checked against Hubbard’s originaldictation.“The extent to which the references to homosexuality have changed arebecause of mistaken dictation?” I asked.“No, because of the insertion, I guess, of somebody who was a bigot,” Davisreplied. “The point is, it wasn’t Mr. Hubbard.”“Somebody put the material in those—”“I can only imagine,” Davis said, cutting me off.“Who would have done it?”“I have no idea.”"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"“Hmm.”“I don’t think it really matters,” Davis said. “The point is that neither Mr.Hubbard nor the church has any opinion on the subject of anyone’s sexualorientation....”“Someone inserted words that were not his into literature that was propagatedunder his name, and that’s been corrected now?” I asked, trying to be clear.“Yeah, I can only assume that’s what happened,” Davis said. “And by theway,” he added, referring to Quentin Hubbard, “his son’s not gay.”During his presentation, Davis showed an impressively produced video thatportrayed Scientology’s worldwide eʃorts for literary programs and drugeducation, the translation of Hubbard’s work into dozens of languages, and thedeluxe production facilities at Gold Base. “The real question is who wouldproduce the kind of material we produce and do the kinds of things we do, setup the kind of organizational structure that we set up?” Davis asked. “Or whatkind of man, like L. Ron Hubbard, would spend an entire lifetime researching,putting together the kind of material, suʃer all the trials and tribulations and gothrough all the things he went through in his life ... or even with the things thatwe, as individuals, have to go through, as part of the new religion? Work sevendays a week, three hundred sixty-ɹve days a year, fourteen-, ɹfteen-, eighteen-hour days sometimes, out of sheer total complete dedication to our faith. And doit all, for what? As some sort of sham? Just to pull the wool over everyone’seyes?” He concluded, “It’s ridiculous. Nobody works that hard to cheat people.Nobody gets that little sleep to screw over their fellow man.”We came to the section in the queries dealing with Hubbard’s war record. Hisvoice ɹlling with emotion, Davis said that if it was true that Hubbard had notbeen injured, then “the injuries that he handled by the use of Dianeticsprocedures were never handled, because they were injuries that never existed;therefore, Dianetics is based on a lie; therefore, Scientology is based on a lie.”He concluded: “The fact of the matter is that Mr. Hubbard was a war hero.”I believe everyone on The New Yorker side of the table was taken aback bythis daring equation, one that seemed not only fair but testable. As proof of hisclaim that Hubbard had been injured, Davis provided a letter from the US NavalHospital in Oakland, dated December 1, 1945. It states that Hubbard had beenhospitalized that year for a duodenal ulcer, but was pronounced “ɹt for duty.”Davis had highlighted a passage in the letter: “Eyesight very poor, beginningwith conjunctivitis actinic in 1942. Lame in right hip from service connectedinjury. Infection in bone. Not misconduct, all service connected.” Davis addedlater that according to Robert Heinlein, Hubbard’s ankles had suʃered a"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"“drumhead-type injury”; this can result, Davis explained, “when a ship istorpedoed or bombed.”Despite subsequent requests to produce additional records, this was the onlydocument Davis provided to prove that the founder of Scientology was not lyingabout his war injuries. And yet, Hubbard’s medical records show that only ɹvedays after receiving the doctor’s note, Hubbard applied for a pension based onhis conjunctivitis, an ulcer, a sprained knee, malaria, and arthritis in his righthip and shoulder. His vision was little changed from what it had been before thewar. This was the same period during which Hubbard claimed to have beenblinded and made a hopeless cripple.Davis acknowledged that some of Hubbard’s medical records did notcorroborate the founder’s version of events. The church itself, Davis conɹded,had been troubled by the contradiction between Hubbard’s story and the oɽcialmedical records. But he said there were other records that did conɹrmHubbard’s version of events, based on various documents the church hadassembled. I asked where the documents had come from. “From St. Louis,”Davis explained, “from the archives of navy and military service. And also, thechurch got it from various avenues of research. Just meeting people, gettingrecords from people.”The man who examined the records and reconciled the dilemma, he said, was“Mr. X.” Davis explained, “Anyone who saw JFK remembers a scene on the Mallwhere Kevin Costner’s character goes and meets a man named Mr. X, who’splayed by Donald Sutherland.” In the ɹlm, Mr. X is an embittered intelligenceagent who explains that the Kennedy assassination was actually a coup staged bythe military-industrial complex. In real life, Davis said, Mr. X was Colonel LeroyFletcher Prouty, who had worked in the Oɽce of Special Operations at thePentagon. (Oliver Stone, who directed JFK, says that Mr. X was a compositecharacter, based in part on Prouty.) In the 1980s, Prouty worked as a consultantfor Scientology and was a frequent contributor to Freedom magazine. “We finallygot so frustrated with this point of conɻicting medical records that we took allof Mr. Hubbard’s records to Fletcher Prouty,” Davis continued. Prouty told thechurch representatives that because Hubbard had an “intelligence background,”his records were subjected to a process known as “sheep-dipping.” Davisexplained that this was military parlance for “what gets done to a set of recordsfor an intelligence oɽcer. And, essentially, they create two sets.” (Prouty diedin 2001.)The sun was setting and the Dunkin’ Donuts sign glowed brighter. As themeeting was ɹnally coming to an end, Davis made a plea for understanding."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"“We’re an organization that’s new and tough and diʃerent and has been througha hell of a lot, and has had its ups and downs,” he said. “And the fact of thematter is nobody will take the time and do the story right.”Davis had staked much of his argument on the veracity of Hubbard’s militaryrecords. The fact-checkers had already ɹled a Freedom of Information Actrequest for all such material with the National Archives in St. Louis, wheremilitary records are kept. Such requests can drag on well past deadline, and wewere running short on time. An editorial assistant, Yvette Siegert, ɻew to St.Louis to speed things along.Meantime, Davis sent me a copy of a document that he said clearly conɹrmedHubbard’s heroism: a “Notice of Separation from the US Naval Service,” datedDecember 6, 1945. The document speciɹes medals won by Hubbard, including aPurple Heart with a Palm, implying that he was wounded in action twice. ButJohn E. Bircher, the spokesman for the Military Order of the Purple Heart,wrote me that the Navy uses gold and silver stars, “NOT a palm,” to indicatemultiple wounds. Davis included a photograph of the actual medals Hubbardsupposedly won, but two of them weren’t even created until after Hubbard leftactive service.There was a ɹre in the St. Louis archives in 1973, which destroyed a numberof documents, but Yvette returned with more than nine hundred pages of whatthe archivists insisted were Hubbard’s complete military records. Nowhere inthe ɹle is there mention of Hubbard’s being wounded in battle or breaking hisfeet. X-rays taken of Hubbard’s right shoulder and hip showed calcium deposits,but there was no evidence of any bone or joint disease in his ankles.There is a Notice of Separation in the oɽcial records, but it is not the oneDavis sent me. The diʃerences in the two documents are telling. The St. Louisdocument indicates that Hubbard earned four medals for service, but theyreɻect no distinction or valor. The church document indicates, falsely, thatHubbard completed four years of college, obtaining a degree in civilengineering. The oɽcial document correctly notes two years of college and nodegree.The oɽcial Notice of Separation was signed by Lieutenant (jg) J. C. Rhodes,who also signed Hubbard’s detachment paperwork. On the church document, thecommanding oɽcer who signed oʃ on Hubbard’s separation was “Howard D.Thompson, Lt. Cmdr.” The ɹle contains a letter, from 2000, to anotherresearcher, who had written for more information about Thompson. An analystwith the National Archives responded that the records of commissioned navaloɽcers at that time had been reviewed and “there was no Howard D. Thompson"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"listed.”The church, after being informed of these discrepancies, asserted, “Our experton military records has advised us that, in his considered opinion, there isnothing in the Thompson notice that would lead him to question its validity.”Eric Voelz and William Seibert, two longtime archivists at the St. Louis facility,examined the church’s document and pronounced it a forgery.10Eric Voelz additionally told The New Yorker, “The United States has neverhanded out Purple Hearts with a palm.” He said that ditto marks, which arefound on the document provided by the church, do not typically appear onforms of this kind. The font was also suspect, since it was not consistent withthe size or style of the times. Voelz had never heard of the “Marine Medal,” andhe took issue with the “Br. & Dtch. Vict. Meds.” found on the church document,saying that medals awarded by foreign countries are not listed on a Notice ofSeparation, and that they were unlikely to have been awarded to an American inany case.A few months after this meeting, Davis and Feshbach stopped representingScientology, even though they continued to be listed as the top spokespeople onthe church website. Rumor from former members is that Davis blew but wasrecovered and once again subjected to sec-checking. Then Feshbach becameseriously ill. According to the church, they are on a leave of absence from theSea Org for medical reasons. They are now living in Texas. When I last spoke toDavis, he said, “I think you should know my allegiances haven’t changed—atall.” He added: “I don’t have to answer your questions anymore.”1 In my meeting with Isham, he had asserted that Scientology is not a “faith-based religion.” Leaving asidethe question of what religion is without faith, I pointed out that in Scientology’s upper levels, there was acosmology that would have to be accepted on faith. Isham responded that he wasn’t going to discuss thedetails of OT III, nor had I asked him to. “You understand the only reason it’s conɹdential is because in thewrong hands it can hurt people,” he told me, evidently referring to Hubbard’s warning that those who arenot spiritually prepared to receive the information would die, of pneumonia.2 The church denies that this ever happened. Davis admits that the briefcase was lost but claims that therewere no sex-related videos inside.3 Davis says he and his wife divorced because of irreconcilable diʃerences, and that “it had nothing to dowith the organization.”4 Davis says that he does not recall meeting Shannon, has never scrubbed a Dumpster, and has no need toborrow money."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"5 Davis denies that he blew or was in Las Vegas.

Did Jesus’ disciples actually encounter their cruciɹed leaderafter his burial? Were these miracles or visions or lies? Would the religionssurvive without them?There is no question that a belief system can have positive, transformativeeʃects on people’s lives. Many current and former Scientologists have attestedto the value of their training and the insight they derived from their study of thereligion. They have the right to believe whatever they choose. But it is adiʃerent matter to use the protections aʃorded a religion by the FirstAmendment to falsify history, to propagate forgeries, and to cover up human-rights abuses.Hubbard once wrote that “the old religion”—by which he meant Christianity—was based on “a very painful lie,” which was the idea of Heaven. “Yes, I’vebeen to Heaven. And so have you,” he writes. “It was complete with gates,angels and plaster saints—and electronic implantation equipment.” Heaven, hesays, was built as an implant station 43 trillion years ago. “So there was aHeaven after all—which is why you are on this planet and were condemnednever to be free again—until Scientology.” He went on: “What does this do toany religious nature of Scientology? It strengthens it. New religions alwaysoverthrow the false gods of the old, they do something to better man. We canimprove man. We can show the old gods false. And we can open up the universeas a happier place in which a spirit may dwell.”One might compare Scientology with the Church of Latter Day Saints, a newreligion of the previous century. The founder of the movement, Joseph Smith,claimed to have received a pair of golden plates from the angel Moroni inupstate New York in 1827, along with a pair of magical “seeing stones,” whichallowed him to read the contents. Three years later, he published The Book ofMormon, founding a movement that would provoke the worst outbreak of"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"religious persecution in American history. Mormons were chased all across thecountry because of their practice of polygamy and their presumed heresy. Smithhimself was murdered by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. His beleaguered followerssought to escape the United States and establish a religious theocracy in theterritory of Utah, which they called Zion. Mormons were so despised that therewas a bill in Congress to exterminate them. And yet Mormonism would evolveand go on to become one of the fastest-growing denominations in the twentieth,and now the twenty-ɹrst, centuries. Members of the faith now openly run forpresident of the United States. In much of the world, this religion, which wasonce tormented because of its perceived anti-American values, is now thought ofas being the most American of religions; indeed, that’s how many Mormonsthink of it as well. It is a measure not only of the religion’s success but also ofthe ability of a faith to adapt and change.And yet Joseph Smith was plainly a liar. In answer to the charge of polygamy,he claimed he had only one wife, when he had already accumulated a harem. Astrange but revealing episode occurred in 1835, when Smith purchased severalEgyptian mummies from an itinerant merchant selling such curiosities. Insidethe mummy cases were scrolls of papyrus, reduced to fragments, which Smithdeclared were the actual writings of the Old Testament patriarchs Abraham andJoseph. Smith produced what he called a translation of the papyri, titled TheBook of Abraham. It still forms a portion of Mormon doctrine. In America at thetime, Egyptian was still thought to be indecipherable, but the Rosetta Stone hadalready been discovered, and Jean-François Champollion had successfullyrendered the hieroglyphic language into French. In 1966, the Joseph Smithpapyri were discovered in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Itwas soon shown that the passages that Smith “translated” were commonfunerary documents with no reference to Abraham or Joseph whatsoever. Thisfraud has been known for decades, but it has made little diʃerence in thegrowth of the religion or the devotion of its adherents. Belief in the irrational isone deɹnition of faith, but it is also true that clinging to absurd or disputeddoctrines binds a community of faith together and deɹnes a barrier to theoutside world.The evolution of Scientology into a religion also resembles the progression ofChristian Science, the faith Tommy Davis was born into. Like Hubbard, MaryBaker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, experimented with alternativeways of healing. Like Hubbard, she claimed to have been an invalid who curedherself; she, too, wrote a book based on her experience, Science and Health withKey to the Scriptures, which became the basis for the founding of the Church of"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Christ, Scientist, in 1879. Far more than is the case with Scientology, ChristianScience stands against mainstream medical practices, even though bothorganizations lay claim to being more “scientiɹc” than religious. Many religions,including Christian Science, Jehovah’s Witnesses, even Christianity—haveknown scorn and persecution. Some, like the Shakers and the Millerites, diedout, but others, including Mormons and Pentecostals, have elbowed their wayinto the crowded religious landscape of American society.The practice of disconnection, or shunning, is not unique to Scientology, nor isthe longing for religious sanctuary. America itself was founded by true believerswho separated themselves from their non-Puritan kinfolk by placing an oceanbetween them. New religious leaders continually appear, giving expression tounmet spiritual needs. There is a constant churning of spiritual movements anddenominations all over the world, one that advances with freedom ofexpression. One must look at L. Ron Hubbard and the odyssey of his movementagainst this historical backdrop and the natural human yearning fortranscendence and submission.In the late 1970s, I lived for several months in an Amish and Mennonitecommunity in central Pennsylvania, researching my first book.1 Their movementhad been nearly annihilated in Europe, but in the 1720s they began takingrefuge in William Penn’s colony, the “holy experiment” of Pennsylvania. Amishlife has remained essentially unchanged since then, a kind of museum ofeighteenth-century farm life. The adherents live sequestered lives, out of thedrift of popular culture, on a kind of religious atoll. I was moved by the beautyand simplicity of their lives. The Amish see the Earth as God’s garden, and theirduty is to tend it. The environment they surround themselves with is ɹlled witha sense of peace and a purposeful orderliness. Individuality is sanded down tothe point that one’s opinions are as similar to another’s as the approved shape ofa bonnet or the regulation beard. Because fashion and novelty are outlawed, onefeels comfortably encased in a timeless, unchanging vacuum. The enforcedconformity dims the noise of diversity and the anxiety of uncertainty; one feelscloser to eternity. One is also aware of the electriɹed fence of orthodoxy thatsurrounds and protects this Edenic paradise, and the expulsion that awaits thosewho doubt or question. Still, there is a kind of quiet majesty in the Amishculture—not because of their rejection of modernity, but because of theirprincipled non-violence and their adherence to a way of living that tempers theirfanaticism. The Amish suʃer none of the social opprobrium that Scientologistsmust endure; indeed, they are generally treated like beloved endangeredanimals, coddled by their neighbors and smiled upon by society. And yet they"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"are highly schismatic, willing to break oʃ all relations with their dearestrelatives on what would seem to an outsider to be an inane point of doctrine oreven the question of whether one can allow eaves on a house or pictures on awall.As adorable as the Amish appear to strangers, such isolated and intellectuallydeprived religious communities can become self-destructive, especially whenthey revolve around the whims of a single tyrannical leader. David Koreshcreated such a community in the Branch Davidian compound that he establishednear Waco and aptly called Ranch Apocalypse. In 1993, I was asked to writeabout the siege that was then under way. I decided not to, because there weremore reporters on the scene than Branch Davidians; however, I had beenunsettled by the sight of the twenty-one children that Koresh sent out of thecompound shortly before the fatal inferno. Those children left behind theirparents and the only life they had known. They were ripped out of thecommunity of faith, placed in government vans, and ushered through a curtainof federal agents and reporters onto the stage of an alien world and who knowswhat future. I thought there must be other children who had experienced similartraumas; what had become of them?There is a strangely contorted mound in a cemetery in Oakland, California,close by the naval hospital where Hubbard spent his last months in uniform.Under an undistinguished headstone rest four hundred bodies out of the morethan nine hundred followers of Jim Jones who perished in Jonestown in 1978.The caskets had been stacked on top of each other on the side of a bulldozedhillside, then the earth was ɹlled in, grass was planted, and the tragedy ofJonestown was buried in the national memory as one more inexplicablereligious calamity. The members of the Peoples Temple, as Jones called hismovement, had been drawn to his Pentecostal healing services, his socialactivism, and his racial egalitarianism. Charisma and madness were inextricablywoven into the fabric of his personality, along with an insatiable sexual appetitethat accompanied Jones’s terror of abandonment. In his search for a securereligious community, Jones had repeatedly uprooted his congregation. Finally,in May 1977, the entire movement disappeared, virtually overnight. Withoutwarning, leaving jobs and homes and family members who were not a part ofthe Peoples Temple, they were spirited away to a jungle encampment inGuyana, South America, which Jones billed as a socialist paradise. There hebegan to school them in suicide.I learned that not everyone had died in Jonestown. Among the survivors wereJones’s three sons: Stephan, Tim, and Jim Junior. They had been away from the"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"camp playing basketball against the Guyanese national team in the capital cityof Georgetown. These haunted young men had never before told their stories.One of the privileges of being a journalist is to be trusted to hear such memoriesin all their emotional complexity. One night I went to dinner with Tim Jonesand his wife, Lorna. Tim was physically powerful, able to press a hundredpounds with either arm, but he couldn’t ɻy on an airplane because of his panicattacks. He wanted his wife to come along because he had never given her a fullaccount, and he wanted to be in a public place so he wouldn’t cry. It was Timwho had to return to Jonestown to identify the bodies of everyone he knew,including his parents, his siblings, and his own wife and children, his wholeworld. He was convinced that, if he had been there, he could have prevented thesuicides. He told this story, bawling, pounding the table, as the waiter steeredaway and the other diners stared at their plates. Never have I felt so keenly thedanger of new religious movements and the damage that is done to people whoare lured into such groups, not out of weakness in character but through theirdesire to do good and live meaningful lives.SCIENTOLOGY WANTS TO BE understood as a scientiɹc approach to spiritualenlightenment. It has, really, no grounding in science at all. It would be betterunderstood as a philosophy of human nature; seen in that light, Hubbard’sthought could be compared with that of other moral philosophers, such asImmanuel Kant and Søren Kierkegaard, although no one has ever approachedthe sweep of Hubbard’s work. His often ingenious and minutely observedcategories of behavior have been shadowed by the bogus elements of hispersonality and the absurdity that is interwoven with his bouts of brilliance,making it diɽcult for non-Scientologists to know what to make of it. Seriousacademic study of his writing has also been constrained by the vindictivereputation of the church.The ɹeld of psychotherapy is Scientology’s more respectable cousin, althoughit cannot honestly claim to be a science, either. Freud’s legacy is that of a freeand open inquiry into the motivations of behavior. He also created postulates—such as the ego, the superego, and the id—that might not endure strict scientiɹctesting, but do oʃer an approach to understanding the inner workings of thepersonality. Hubbard’s concept of the reactive and analytical minds attempts todo something similar. Jung’s exploration of archetypes, based on hispsychological explorations, anticipates the evolution of Dianetics intoScientology—in other words, the drift from therapy to spiritualism."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"There is no point in questioning Scientology’s standing as a religion; in theUnited States, the only opinion that really counts is that of the IRS; moreover,people do believe in the principles of Scientology and live within a community offaith—what else is required to accept it as such? The stories that invite ridiculeor disbelief, such as Xenu and the Galactic Confederacy, may be fanciful—orpure “space opera,” to use Hubbard’s term—but every religion features bizarreand uncanny elements. Just consider some of the obvious sources of Hubbard’sunique concoction—Buddhism, Hinduism, magic, General Semantics, andshamanism—that also provide esoteric categories to explain the ineʃablemysteries of life and consciousness. One can ɹnd parallels in many faiths withthe occult beliefs and practices of Scientology. The concept of expelling bodythetans, for instance, is akin to casting out demons in the Christian tradition. Butlike every new religion, Scientology is handicapped by the frailties of its founderand the absence of venerable traditions that enshrine it in the culture.To an outsider who has struggled to understand the deep appeal ofScientology to its adherents, despite the ɻaws and contradictions of the religionthat many of them reluctantly admit, perhaps the missing element is art. Olderfaiths have a body of literature, music, ceremony, and iconography that infusesthe doctrinal aspects of the religion with mystery and importance. The sensualexperience of being in a great cathedral or mosque may have nothing to do with“belief,” but it does draw people to the religion and rewards them emotionally.Scientology has built many impressive churches, but they are not redolentpalaces of art. The aesthetic element in Scientology is Hubbard’s arresting voiceas a writer. His authoritative but folksy tone and his impressionistic grasp ofhuman nature have cast a spell over millions of readers. More important,however, is the nature of his project: the self-portrait of the inside of his mind.It is perhaps impossible to reduce his mentality to a psychiatric diagnosis, inpart because his own rendering of it is so complex, intricate, and comprehensivethat one can only stand back and appreciate the qualities that drove him, hourafter hour, year after year, to try to get it all on the page—his insight, hisdaring, his narcissism, his defiance, his relentlessness, his imagination—these arethe traits of an artist. It is one reason that Hubbard identiɹed with the creativecommunity and many of them with him.Scientology orients itself toward celebrity, and by doing so, the church awardsfamousness a spiritual value. People who seek fame—especially in theentertainment industry—naturally gravitate to Hollywood, where Scientology iswaiting for them, validating their ambition and promising recruits a way in. Thechurch has pursued a marketing strategy that relies heavily on endorsements by"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"celebrities, who actively promote the religion. They speak of the positive rolethat Scientology has played in their lives. When David Miscavige awarded TomCruise the Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004, he praised his eʃectiveness as aspokesperson, saying, “Across ninety nations, ɹve thousand people hear hisword of Scientology every hour.” It is diɽcult to know how such a ɹgure wasderived, but according to Miscavige, “Every minute of every hour someonereaches for LRH technology, simply because they know Tom Cruise is aScientologist.” Probably no other member of the church derives as muchmaterial beneɹt from his religion as Cruise does, and consequently none bears agreater moral responsibility for the indignities inɻicted on members of the SeaOrg, sometimes directly because of his membership. Excepting Paul Haggis, noprominent Hollywood Scientologist has spoken out publicly against thewidespread allegations of physical abuse, involuntary conɹnement, and forcedservitude within the church’s clergy, although many such ɹgures have quietlywalked away.Since leaving Scientology, Haggis has been in therapy, which he has foundhelpful. He’s learned how much he blames others for his problems, especiallythose closest to him. “I really wish I had found a good therapist when I wastwenty-one,” he said. In Scientology, he always felt a subtle pressure to impresshis auditor and then write up a glowing success story. Now, he said, “I’m notfooling myself that I’m a better man than I am.”The same month that Haggis’s resignation from the church had become public,United Artists, Tom Cruise’s studio, terminated Haggis’s development deal. Iasked if the break had anything to do with his resignation. Haggis thought for amoment, then said, “You don’t do something that obvious—it’d be a bad PRmove.” He added, “They’d run out of money, so we all knew we were beingkicked out.”Recently, he and Deborah decided to divorce. They have moved to the sameneighborhood in New York, so that they can share custody of their son. Deborahhas also left the church. Both say that the decision to end their marriage hasnothing to do with their renunciation of Scientology.On November 9, 2010, The Next Three Days premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre,in Manhattan. Movie stars lined the red carpet as photographers ɹred away.Jason Beghe was there, and he told me that he had taken in Daniel Montalvo,the young man who lost his ɹnger in the church book-publishing plant.Montalvo had recently blown from the Sea Org. He was nineteen years old.“He’s never seen television,” the actor marveled. “He doesn’t even know whoRobert Redford is.” Nazanin Boniadi, who has a small part in the movie, was"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"also there; Haggis had given her the role after learning what had happened toher after the church had engineered her match with Tom Cruise. “Naz’s storywas one of those that made me realize I had been lied to for a long time, that Ihad to leave and do so loudly,” Haggis later confided.After the screening, everyone drifted over to the Oak Room of the PlazaHotel. Haggis was in a corner receiving accolades from his friends when I foundhim. I asked if he felt that he had ɹnally left Scientology. “I feel much moremyself, but there’s a sadness,” he admitted. “If you identify yourself withsomething for so long, and suddenly you think of yourself as not that thing, itleaves a bit of space.” He went on, “It’s not really the sense of a loss ofcommunity. Those people who walked away from me were never really myfriends.” He understood how they felt about him, and why. “In Scientology, inthe Ethics Conditions, as you go down from Normal through Doubt, you get toEnemy, and ɹnally, near the bottom, there is Treason. What I did was atreasonous act.”The ɹlm did poorly at the box oɽce. It had the misfortune of opening tomixed reviews on the same night that the last installment of the Harry Potterseries premiered. Haggis had to close his oɽce. It looked like another bleakperiod in his career, but he followed it by writing a screenplay for a video game,Modern Warfare 3, which would go on to set a sales record, earning $1 billion inthe first sixteen days after its release.I once asked Haggis about the future of his relationship with Scientology.“These people have long memories,” he told me. “My bet is that, within twoyears, you’re going to read something about me in a scandal that looks like ithas nothing to do with the church.” He thought for a moment, then said, “I wasin a cult for thirty-four years. Everyone else could see it. I don’t know why Icouldn’t.”MARTY RATHBUN DIVIDES the people who leave Scientology into three camps. Thereare those who reject the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard entirely, such as PaulHaggis; and those who still believe entirely, but think that the church underDavid Miscavige has taken Scientology away from the original, true teachings ofthe founder. There is a third category, which he has been struggling to deɹne,that includes those people who are willing neither to swallow all the dogma norto throw away the insights they gained from their experience. Hubbard’s life andteachings are still the guideposts of their lives. “It wouldn’t stick if there wasn’ta tremendous amount of good it did for them,” Rathbun says. He’s been studying"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"the history of other religions for parallels, and he quotes an old Zen proverb:“When the master points at the Moon, many people never see it at all, they onlylook at the master.”Rathbun has been counseling Scientologists who leave the church, and becauseof that he’s been subject to continual monitoring and harassment from thechurch. His computers have been hacked and phone records have been stolen. Agroup of “Squirrel Busters” moved into his little community of Ingleside on theBay, near Corpus Christi, in order to spy on him and drive him away throughconstant harassment. They wore video cameras on their hats and patrolled theneighborhood in a golf cart or occasionally a paddleboat. This lasted for 199days. That tactic didn’t work, because his neighbors rallied to his support. Manyother defectors have been harassed and followed by private investigators.On a sweltering Fourth of July weekend, 2011, a group of about a hundred“independent” Scientologists gathered at a lake cabin in East Texas. Rathbun andMike Rinder had organized it. A few courageous swimmers were leaping oʃ thedock, but rumors of alligators kept most people on the shore. A brief, powerfulstorm rolled through, driving everyone to shelter.One of the attendees was Stephen Pfauth, known as Sarge, a Vietnam veteranwho had gotten into Scientology in 1975. He is a slender man with hauntedeyes. “It was one of those sudden things that happened,” he explained. “I waslooking for something, especially spiritually.” He had run across anadvertisement on the back of a magazine for Hubbard’s book Fundamentals ofThought. Soon after reading it, he ɻew to Washington, DC, and took a three-dayworkshop called Life Repair Auditing. “I was blown away.” He immediately quithis job. “I sold my house and bought the Bridge.” Soon, a church oɽcial begancultivating him, saying, “LRH needs your help.” Pfauth joined the Sea Org thatNovember.He became head of Hubbard’s security detail, and was with the founder on hisCreston ranch in his ɹnal days, with Pat and Annie Broeker. In early 1985,Hubbard became extremely ill and spent a week in a hospital. Pfauth was told itwas for pancreatitis. “I didn’t ɹnd out about the strokes until later,” he said.After that, Hubbard stayed mostly in his Blue Bird bus, except when he came outto do his own laundry. Pfauth might be shoveling out the stables and they’d talk."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"Marty Rathbun with an E-Meter at his home in Ingleside on the Bay, Texas, 2011Six weeks before the leader died, Pfauth hesitantly related, Hubbard calledhim into the bus. He was sitting in his little breakfast nook. “He told me he wasdropping his body. He named a speciɹc star he was going to circle. That rehabsa being. He told me he’d failed, he’s leaving,” Pfauth said. “He said he’s notcoming back here to Earth. He didn’t know where he’d wind up.”“How’d you react?” I asked.“I got good and pissy-ass drunk,” Pfauth said. “Annie found me at ɹve in themorning in my old truck, Kris Kringle, and I had beer cans all around me. I didnot take it well.”I mentioned the legend in Scientology that Hubbard will return.“That’s bull crap,” Pfauth said. “He wanted to drop the body and leave. Andhe told me basically that he’d failed. All the work and everything, he’d failed.”I had heard a story that Pfauth had built some kind of electroshockmechanism for Hubbard in the last month of his life. I didn’t know what tomake of it, given Hubbard’s horror of electroshock therapy. Pfauth’s eyessearched the ceiling as if he were looking for divine help. He explained thatHubbard was having trouble getting rid of a body thetan. “He wanted me tobuild a machine that would up the voltage and basically blow the thetan away.You can’t kill a thetan but just get him out of there. And also kill the body.”“So it was a suicide machine?”"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"“Basically.”Pfauth was staggered by Hubbard’s request, but the challenge interested him.“I ɹgured that building a Tesla coil was the best way to go.” The Tesla coil is atransformer that increases the voltage without upping the current. Pfauthpowered it with a 12-volt automobile battery, and then hooked the entireapparatus to an E-Meter. “So, if you’re on the cans, you can ɻip a button and itdoes its thing,” Pfauth explained. “I didn’t want to kill him, just to scare him.”“Did he try it?”“He blew up my E-Meter. Annie brought it back to me, all burnt up.”This was just before Christmas, 1985. Hubbard died a few weeks later of anunrelated stroke.The believers are still waiting for his return.1 City Children, Country Summer (Scribner’s, 1979)."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Acknowledgments and a Note on SourcesCompared with other religions I have written about, the published literature onScientology is impoverished and clouded by bogus assertions. Some crucialdetails one would want to know about the church have been withheld—forinstance, the number of people who are members of the InternationalAssociation of Scientologists, which would be the best guide to knowing the truedimensions of the church’s membership. The church promised to provide anorganizational chart, but never did so; in any case, it would have been morenotional than actual in terms of the ɻow of authority and responsibility, sincemany of the church’s executive hierarchy have been quarantined for years in theHole at the direction of the only individual who controls the institution.L. Ron Hubbard’s extensive—indeed, record-breaking—published works formthe core of the documentary material that this book draws upon. Hubbardexpressed himself variously in books, articles, bulletins, letters, lectures, andjournals; one cannot understand the man or the organization he created withoutexamining his work in each of these media. The church has published a usefulcompendium of Hubbard’s thought in What Is Scientology? Although the churchemploys a full-time Hubbard biographer and has commissioned severalcomprehensive works in the past, there is still no authorized account ofHubbard’s life. One of the previous Hubbard biographers, Omar Garrison, didwrite a full-scale account of Hubbard’s life, which was suppressed. The churchhas published a series of Ron magazines, which have been compiled as a highlyselective encyclopedia. For years, the church has been mopping up otherdocuments—journals, letters, photographs—and withholding them from publicview, which makes it diɽcult for independent researchers to ɹll in blanks in thehistorical record.There are several important repositories of information that I have used inthis book, however: the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress; theHeinlein Prize Trust and the UC Santa Cruz Archives; the Kenneth SpencerResearch Library of the University of Kansas; and the National PersonnelRecords Center in St. Louis, Missouri. The Stephen A. Kent Collection onAlternative Religions, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, housesan important collection of Scientology material, and Professor Kent graciouslyallowed my assistant, Lauren Wolf, to work in his archive. In addition to beingan endless source of memories on the history of the church, Karen de la Carrieremade her extensive photographic archive available. Many thanks to these"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"valuable resources for their cooperation.There are three major unauthorized biographies of L. Ron Hubbard: RussellMiller’s excellent Bare-Faced Messiah (1987) was the ɹrst in-depth look at theman. Scientology unsuccessfully sued Miller, a British journalist, who says thatwhile researching his book he was spied upon, his phone was tapped, and eʃortswere made to frame him for a murder he did not commit. Soon thereafter, BentCorydon’s L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman? (1987) appeared, followed byJon Atack’s A Piece of Blue Sky (1990). The church attempts to discredit both ofthese authors because they are former Scientologists who the church says wereexpelled from the organization. It is notable that no comprehensive biography ofHubbard has been attempted since the church’s campaign against these books.The scarcity of academic work on the church and its leaders testiɹes to thecaution with which scholars regard the subject, as well as the reluctance of theorganization to divulge information about its members, beliefs, and innerworkings to qualified social scientists. In 1976, Roy Wallis published The Road toTotal Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology, the ɹrst signiɹcant academicstudy of the church. While he was researching his book, Wallis was spied upon,and forged letters were sent to his colleagues and employers implicating him ina homosexual relationship. Renunciation and Reformulation: A Study of Conversionin an American Sect, an insightful book by Harriet Whitehead, an anthropologist,appeared in 1987. Since then, contributions from the academy have beenmeager. At this point, I should also acknowledge the work of Hugh Urban, atOhio State University, David S. Touretzky at Carnegie Mellon University, andStephen Kent, at the University of Alberta. Each of these scholars has producedimportant contributions to the understanding of Scientology, despite theobstacles and threats posed by the church.Court documents contain a valuable record of the history and culture of thechurch and its founder; this is especially true of the landmark 1991 suit Churchof Scientology California vs. Gerald Armstrong. David Miscavige has been shy aboutgiving interviews, but he has provided testimony and declarations in severallawsuits, most extensively in 1990, in Bent Corydon v. Church of Scientology.A handful of courageous journalists have provided much of the essentialinformation available about the culture of Scientology. Paulette Cooper openedthe door with her 1971 exposé, The Scandal of Scientology. I have outlined in thisbook some of the harassment that she endured. Joel Sappell and Robert W.Welkos of the Los Angeles Times did a remarkable six-part series in 1990. RichardLeiby has been writing about Scientology since the early 1980s, ɹrst for theClearwater Sun and subsequently for the Washington Post. Richard Behar covered"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"the subject in Barron’s and most notably in his 1991 exposé for Time, “TheThriving Cult of Greed and Power.” Janet Reitman had unparalleled access tothe church for her 2006 Rolling Stone article, “Inside Scientology,” which becamea book of the same title in 2011. Chris Owen, an independent researcher, haswritten extensively about the church online, and has revealed much of theinformation available about Hubbard’s wartime experiences. Tom Smith hasconducted a number of knowledgeable interviews on his radio show, The Edge,broadcast by Hillsborough Community College in Tampa, Florida. Joe Childsand Thomas C. Tobin of the Tampa Bay Times (formerly the St. Petersburg Times)have written groundbreaking stories, especially about the abuse inside thechurch hierarchy. Tony Ortega has been writing about Scientology since 1995,for the Phoenix New Times, and he continued as a valuable resource in the pagesand the blog of the Village Voice until his recent resignation. Several of thesejournalists have been harassed, investigated, sued, or threatened in variousways. I am the beneficiary of their skill and persistence.In the last decade, defectors from the Sea Org have provided a rich trove ofpersonal accounts. These have taken the form of memoirs and blog postings, andthey have accumulated into an immense indictment of the inner workings of thechurch. Among the memoirs I should single out are Marc Headley’s Blown forGood: Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology (2009); Nancy Many’s My Billion YearContract (2009); Amy Scobee’s Abuse at the Top (2010); and Jeʃerson Hawkins’sCounterfeit Dreams (2010). Kate Bornstein’s A Queer and Pleasant Danger (2012)provides an especially interesting account of the Apollo days.Websites devoted to challenging the church have proliferated, beginning withalt.religion.scientology in 1991. Some of the most active are Andreas Heldal-Lund’s Operation Clambake at xenu.net; Steve Hall’s scientology-cult.com;Arnaldo Lerma’s lermanet.com, and the Ex Scientology Message Board, which isan online community for former members of the church, founded by “Emma”and now run by “Mick Wenlock and Ethercat.” Exscientologykids.org, started byJenna Miscavige Hill, David Miscavige’s niece, among others, played animportant role in Paul Haggis’s decision to leave the church. Although many ofthe postings on these websites are anonymous, they provide rich texture to asubculture that few outsiders can appreciate.One blog has become a rallying point for “independent” Scientologists whohave renounced the oɽcial church: Marty Rathbun’s Moving on Up a LittleHigher, which began in 2009. It has been the source of many telling personalstories, as well as documents leaked by church insiders. Rathbun and his wife,Monique Carle, have suʃered constant harassment, along with surveillance by"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"private investigators, because of his open challenge to Miscavige’s authority.In researching this book, I conducted hundreds of interviews, thepreponderance of them on the record. I have always been sparing in relying onanonymous sources, but writing about Scientology poses a challenge for areporter. A number of my sources were fearful of retribution by the church—inparticular, legal harassment and the loss of contact with family members. Manykey individuals have signed conɹdentiality agreements that enforce theirsilence. I owe all my sources a great debt of gratitude for their willingness tospeak to me despite the risk to their own well-being.Paul Haggis plays a unique role in this book. He never intended to talkpublicly about his experience in the church. That he opened up to me, knowingthe church’s reputation for retribution, is a measure of his courage and hisforthrightness.This book is dedicated to my colleagues at The New Yorker, and so my list ofdebts includes the many people there who assisted me in writing the proɹle ofPaul Haggis (“The Apostate,” Feb. 14 and 21, 2011) that became the startingpoint for my research into Scientology. I had talked previously with DavidRemnick, the editor of the magazine, about an article on the Church ofScientology. David appreciated the legal hazards, but I don’t think either of usrealized the amount of time and resources the piece would ultimately require.His commitment was all the more meaningful coming during a period when themagazine was under the same ɹnancial stress that other print media wereexperiencing. My editor at The New Yorker, Daniel Zalewski, has shepherded methrough many articles, and his steadiness and advocacy are always deeplyappreciated. Daniel’s assistant at the time, Yvette Siegert, cheerfully ɻew to St.Louis as our deadline approached to fetch L. Ron Hubbard’s military recordsfrom the archives there. Lynn Oberlander, the magazine’s lawyer, was a stalwartally, undaunted by the legal team arrayed by the church and by certaincelebrities who were mentioned in the article. Ann Goldstein, the magazine’scopy chief, did her usual careful and respectful job. Nick Traverse and KellyBare labored to put the thousands of pages of documents on the Cloud—a highlyexperimental procedure at this old-school magazine—so that we could all haveaccess to the same material simultaneously. I want to pay particular tribute tothe New Yorker fact-checking department, headed by Peter Canby. Jennifer Stahlwas the lead checker, spending six months full-time on the piece; herscrupulousness was inspiring, and she commanded the respect of everyone whodealt with her. Tim Farrington also worked intensely on the article. Eventually,a good portion of the department pitched in, including Nandi Rodrigo, Mike"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Spies, Katia Bachko, and even Peter himself. To be supported by such trulyprofessional colleagues means so much.Although the Church of Scientology was not a willing partner in the eʃort towrite this book, I want to thank the spokespeople I worked with—TommyDavis, Jessica Feshbach, and Karin Pouw—for responding to what must haveseemed an endless stream of queries from me and the fact-checkers. I have nodoubt that they will quarrel with the results, but the book is more accuratebecause of their participation, however reluctant that might have been. Initially,Davis permitted me to speak with several active members of the church, but thedoor closed on that opportunity. I was never allowed to talk to David Miscavigeor any of the upper-tier executives I requested. (As I would learn, many of themwere sequestered and not available in any case.) A reporter can only talk topeople who are willing to talk to him; whatever complaints the church mayhave about my reporting, many limitations can be attributed to its decision torestrict my interactions with people who might have provided more favorabletestimony.Robert Jay Lifton did me the honor of reading this book in manuscript andproviding his insights, especially on the issue of thought reform. R. ScottAppleby helped me place Scientology in the context of other world religions. Myfriend Stephen Harrigan also commented on an early draft, as he has done onmany occasions. A writer depends on such willing friends.My editor at Knopf, Ann Close, has been through ɹve books with me—amarvelous relationship that has now spanned a quarter of a century. For thisbook, the Knopf team labored under a stressful deadline, and I would like toacknowledge the extraordinary eʃorts of Anke Steinecke, legal counsel;Katherine Hourigan, the managing editor; Paul Bogaards, the director ofpublicity; Kim Thornton, the publicist for this book; Kevin Bourke, theproduction editor; Claire Bradley Ong, the production manager; and CassandraPappas, the designer. I also thank my agent, Andrew Wylie, for his sage counsel.When I began writing the book, I hired two young and talented fact-checkers,Axel Gerdau and Lauren Wolf. They were both interested in long-formjournalism, and I thought I might be able to teach them something about that;so, one evening a week, I held a class for them, in which the text was theunwritten book we were working on. Axel and Lauren were immediatelyplunged into the recondite world of Scientology, but they adroitly managed tonegotiate the language and the thinking. After Axel went on to other pursuits,Lauren remained as my research assistant.

By1990, more than twenty of Hubbard’s books—both novels and nonfiction—had become national best sellers, most of them after his death four yearsearlier. At one point, Hubbard had fourteen consecutive books on the NewYork Times best-seller lists. There were allegations that the church wassending members to buy massive quantities of Hubbard’s books to drive upthe sales figures. The Times investigated those charges but failed to findany instances where large numbers of Hubbard books were being sold tosingle individuals. In any case, the booksellers were happy to sell them.16 “He has had a string”: Tommy Davis denies that Miscavige met Haggis atthe race. “Indeed, we cannot find any record that Mr. Haggis ever met Mr.Miscavige.” Both Bill Dendiu and Haggis recall the conversation, however.Jefferson Hawkins has written that Miscavige and other Scientologyexecutives were at the race; Counterfeit Dreams, p. 174.
