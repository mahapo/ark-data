Administration.The purpose of this Series is to bring a standard in Auditor Administrationthroughout the world.DEFINITIONSAUDITOR—A listener or one who listens carefully to what people have to say. AnAuditor is a person trained and qualified in applying Scientologyprocesses to others for their betterment.ADMINISTRATION—Consists of the formation and handling of the lines andterminals involved in production.AUDITOR ADMINISTRATION—would include:1. The know-how of writing session reports.2. The know-how of folder arrangement.3. The know-how of all lines and terminals in the Tech Area. (Covered mainlyin C/S Series 25.)4. The know-how of other lines and terminals in the Org that directly relate toan Auditor getting out his product.LRH QUOTES“ALWAYS ADMINISTRATION IS A COMMUNICATION.”“Administration is important because the Administration is a piece of truth.”“‘Administration of a Folder’ is a responsibility and so is ‘The AdministrativeLines of the Technical Division’.”“NO AUDITOR HAS ANY BUSINESS BEING IGNORANT OFADMINISTRATION. “(Reference: TAPE 12.6.71 WELCOME TO THEFLAG INTERN COURSE)3"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"C/S SERIES 56C/S Series 56 can be considered as Auditor Admin Series 2 and comes next inthis Series.C/S Series 56 covers the function of Administration in obtaining excellent caseresults.USE OF THE SERIESThe Auditor Admin Series is made into packs.The packs are made available to Student Auditors, HGC Auditors, C/Ses, HGCAdmin Personnel, Cramming, the Qual Library, and all Technical Executives.The Series is added to Auditor and C/S Course Checksheets.It is used by HGC Auditors and Internes to check if the Admin they are turning inis “by the book”.It can be used by the C/S through the Cramming Officer to cram an Auditor on anAdmin Error.An Error would be handled by directing the Auditor to one specific HCO B orBTB in the Series that dealt with that specific point. Continuing Admin Errors wouldget the whole pack.PRODUCTThe product of the application of this Series is Standard Auditor Administrationthroughout the world, with the viability of improved Auditing Delivery and Results.

They think general techresults improve only by more tech study. If they continue to think this way they windup squirreling. For they are working on a wrong target for improvement, a wrongWHY or reason.Auditing is a team activity. The day of the individual country doctor is dead. Evenif an individual field auditor starts out as an individual he goes one of two directions—he overworks and squirrels himself into failure or he builds up a team—may only be areceptionist and an apprentice auditor but he is still building up a team. I have neverseen individual auditors succeed over a long period. Failing to form or become part of ateam, they eventually fade out or squirrel.The reason is simple enough.These rules apply:TO IMPROVE TECH RESULTS YOU MUST IMPROVE ADMINISTRATION.And I don’t mean just writing better in folders.DEFINITIONADMINISTRATION consists of the formation and handling of the lines andterminals involved in production.Unless an auditor understands this fully, he will never insist on a Tech Sec, aTech Establishment Officer, D of P, C/S, Examiner, Pages, Folder Admin and himselfwill begin to omit keeping a Folder Summary and then omit the session actions andthen, with big loses, retire from it all.If I were an auditor and saw some of these things missing, I’d be liable to say,“Are you guys kidding? I thought we were here to audit pcs.”Without the correct pattern of lines and terminals YOU DON’T GET RESULTS,you get headaches, mad neighbors and refunds.Auditing on lines, an auditor should regard himself as a highly skilled expert, atechnical specialist whose work requires respect and service.And Case Supervising on lines, a Case Supervisor should consider himself a sortof Czar whose word is so law even the Exec Director thinks several times before heapproaches—duly servile of course and bowing the prescribed three times as he exits.5"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"A Class XII on Flag is listened to by others with a hush even if he is onlycommenting on the weather.These are the stars of the team. Their worldwide reputation for smooth flublessauditing is an administrative result!Short of space, overloaded, short of admin personnel, turning out the highestwell done hours in the world, Flag’s Div IV produces because of an Admin system.The highest of these C/Ses and auditors goes to Cramming if he misplaces acomma or drops a TR 1.If the sessions’ exams at Examiner drop from 90% F/N the whole place getsoverhauled.Folders are Folder Error Summaried by an FES section. The Folder Summary iskept up each session (or Cramming). The folder is studied and C/Sed. The D of Passigns the sessions. The C/S is done correctly (or Cramming). The folder travels onits lines. The tests are done.In short it is a complex but constantly flowing pattern of moving pcs, folders andexaminations interspersed with testing and interviews and re-registration.There is a right way to do it.RESULTSIf an org has only 65% of its sessions F/N VGIs at Examiner the right answer isto organize the place.Why?Well, the first answer is that the third dynamic is stronger than the first dynamic.An auditor auditing alone is a first dynamic. The pc is a first dynamic. As it is theauditor plus pc that must be greater than the reactive mind, one can easily work the restout.If the auditor is part of a functioning third dynamic, not just an individual, theauditor plus pc versus the bank is a LOT more than the bank.Another answer is that an auditor knows the pc, if only because of sessions, andpersonal opinion enters into it. That is not a pure technical view as a C/S’s must be.Another answer is that an auditor in a group gets more auditing done.Individually practicing auditors often fail because nobody is taking care of theauditor as a person. Further they get loses. No one sends them to Cramming. Whenthey get loses they often start squirreling. Then they really get loses.That ends them as auditors.An auditor working in a good on policy organization is given service. He does getsent to Cramming. He does keep his tech updated. He gets wins. When he doesn’t he’sput back on standard tech. So he happily keeps going and makes lots of happy people.So if I were auditing in a group I would insist as a condition of work that Div IVand Div V be good on policy divisions, fully organized with no nonsense.I know whereof I speak. As a part-time duty I work as a consulting C/S with agood IV and a good V. Sometimes I have had to take over the whole C/S line. Whenthe organization bogs in any way I know the whole thing is heading toward single-6"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"handing the lot. So I get the lines back in and get people to Cramming and get the F/Nat Examiner ratio approaching 100% again.Thus, the advice you get about C/Sing is live-live-live, not canned theory.ORG WINSBeing on administrative lines to all orgs, I can tell you pointblank thatTHEIR STATS DEPEND ON THEIR VOLUME AND QUALITY OFSERVICE.That isn’t propaganda. It’s pure fact.The F/N-no F/N at Examiner ratio tells you at once if Divs IV and V are organizedand operating or if they are just fooling about.At 50% to 75% F/N at Examiner the administrative functions of Divs IV and Vare stinking bad. C/S Series 25 is out. Cramming is out. Hidden data lines exist. HCOBs, books and tapes are not used.The public, at that % of F/N, will stay away in droves. Registrars will go battyand adopt “Hot Prospect Systems”.The staff will go low pay and the execs will be a perpetual dark shade of purplefrom yelling. The cash-bills ratio will be the subject of finance missions and theneighbors will be phoning the police.Why?Because an org is itself a technical delivery organization and 50% to 75% F/N atExaminer is an overt product.The Academy has already failed to apply student study tech and word clearing.Qual is a joke.There is no library of tech available and if available isn’t read.The org as a tech service delivery unit is treating its public to a no-auditingsituation and will get in trouble.REMEDYThe way to remedy is to get on policy with tech organization.Put in a Qual with word clearing and a library and cramming.Put in the C/S Series 25 Tech lines.Tolerate NO out-tech or out-admin in folders.Dummy run the lines until they’re in.Cram Cram Cram C/S and auditor and tech personnel flubs whenever they occur.Get the organization functioning.Your F/N at Examiner ratio will climb straight up to 90% 95% 98%.By actual test pcs will flood in, Reg lines will get easy, success stats soar.More auditors more C/Ses, more organization. A second, a third HGC.7"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"And the more thoroughly the admin lines are manned the better the tech lineswork.This conclusion came from actual inspections of orgs and studies of their stats.Orgs should be selling more training than processing.But why train if you can’t interne them in a good Qual and HGC? They’ll neveramount to anything as auditors unless they work in an organization that is on tech andon policy.So you need an HGC.Tech, done in a proper administrative framework, works.Some orgs really don’t believe they could ever attain the flubless auditing qualityof Flag.But they can.It is even easy.It is even easier to attain flubless quality of auditing than any other kind.You put in a real on policy admin pattern in IV and V. You begin with a QualInterne Course.You send to Cramming for any C/S or auditing error no matter how minute.The results come up.The errors cease.You’re a success! If you do it.  L.

The month is writtenin letters so no confusion on numbers occurs.POSITION OF GRAPHThe graph is kept paper clipped on the inside cover of the folder (on top of the F/S and belowthe programs), so it can be taken out and the next OCA drawn in.The answer sheet that the pc fills in is placed with the worksheets of that date, after the graph isdrawn.RESPONSIBILITYIt is the responsibility of HGC Admin to see that when the C/S requests an OCA, the pc isrouted to Testing and the test gets done, and the results entered on the graph and the test sheets filed inthe folder.References: HCO B 17 July 71 C/S Series 51OUT OF VALENCE HCO B 19 Dec 71 C/S Series 71D OF P OPERATES BY OCAs HCO B 24 Feb 72 C/S Series 71AWORD CLEARING OCAs  Compiled by  Training & Services BurReissued as BTB by Flag Mission 1234  I/C: CPO Andrea Lewis  2nd: Molly Harlow  Authorized by AVUBDCS:SW:AL:MH:BL:MM:mh.rdfor theCopyright © 1972,1974BOARDS OF DIRECTORSby L.

Further it gives the proper number of pages the session went.The Worksheet is written in two columns. The Auditor writes down the left-handcolumn and then down the right-hand column.CONTENT OF WORKSHEETThe most important parts of the session to be noted are:A. When the TA goes up (on what?)B. When the TA goes down (on what?)C. When an F/N occurs (on what—any cog?)D. When VGIs occur (on what?)E. When BIs occur (on what?)F. How the process ran (what commands are being run?)G. ReadsTA and time notations should be made at regular intervals throughout the session.When a process reaches EP—write in the pc’s cognition, circle the F/N andwhether or not it was indicated, note the pc’s indicators, the time and TA.When Two-Way Comming a subject it is essential that all items (terminals,statements, etc) that read are so marked on the worksheets—LF, LFBD. All readingitems are circled in green after the session.R/S items, Ethics situations, Ser Facs and Evil Purps are marked, after thesession, by ringing them on the W/S with a red pen.41"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"SHORTHANDINGAuditors usually develop a system of shorthanding the session actions beingdone, so that session speed is not hampered by Admin.For example, the repetitive process: Recall a change Recall a no-change Recall a failed changeis run as a bracket (the pc is given the first command, then the second and then the thirdand then the first and then the second, etc).The first command can be abbreviated to 1, the second to 2, and the third to 3.The W/S therefore would look like:12.322.8a √failed √(note that each word of the command iscleared before clearing the command aschange √a whole)no-change √recall √(F/N)1. cleared2. cleared3. cleared12.492.61.

They are never recopied.The Auditor should always read over his W/sheets before turning in the folder tothe Case Supervisor and if any words or letters are missing or cannot be read, theyshould be put in in block print, in red.Example:This can be overdone, to the extent that it is almost sarcasm. At the most it shouldjust run into one or two corrections to a page. If the Auditor is having to correct thepage more than that he should learn how to write rapidly and legibly. See HCOB 3 Nov71, C/S Series 66, “Auditor’s Worksheets”, which also appears as Auditor AdminSeries 15 and comes next in this series.NECESSITY OF WORKSHEETSIt is a CRIME to give any session without making an Auditor’s Report (i.e. actualW/S taken at that time) or to copy the original W/sheets after the session and submit acopy instead of the real reports.Assist Reports that use only Contact or Touch Assist are written after the sessionand sent to HGC Admin to be filed in the pc folder.

The auditor after many such practice sessions winds up writing clearly andfast. This can be increased until an auditor can write clearly as fast as people talk.The occasional headaches a C/S might get are not from the restim of the case he’sstudying but are from the words on W/Ses he can’t make out.If a C/S does not insist on both block print clarification and auditor writingpractice, he will wind up not reading worksheets and may even get foggy about certaincases.A remedy is to go back to the first folders not understood and get the wordsclarified and then keep this C/S Series HCO B IN.

The first is a full detailed FES where one goes backand picks up and notes down all past errors on the case so that a Progress and Advance Program can bedone.Where the C/S is interested in handling the case more rapidly, the procedure is to go back towhere the Pc was running well and come forward, looking for the goofs to repair. This would alsoapply in the case of a Pc who, already repaired, was goofed in further auditing. These are different FESmethods—a Progress Program and Repair C/Sing. Neither one includes Admin errors or errors whichdo not affect the case.THE FLAWFolder Error Summaries (FESes) which do not show clearly whether an error has been correctedlater in the Pc’s auditing, can lead the C/S into over-repair. Such a flaw lessens the usefulness of anFES.NEW FORMATTo handle the above flaw, the layout and contents of the FES have been revised. The followingis the format of the FES which should be on legal or equivalent size pink or red paper according toavailability.One can see at a glance that all the noted errors have been corrected. A blank space in the right-hand column would indicate that the error had not yet been fixed.56"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"This column is filled in by the FESer as he goes along, or by the Auditor as correction is done.For example a note: “Chronic high TA” would be marked off by the Auditor “C/S 53RJ to F/N List.TA normal” with the date, when that action had been completed.Any error noted in the correction of the case IS NOTED AS A NEW ERROR ON THE FES.THE FES IS KEPT IN PT BY THE AUDITOR AS ERRORS ARE NOTED.The C/S will use the FES as a help in further programming of the Pc.It is kept in the inside back cover of the Pc’s folder.WHAT IS WANTED IN AN FESAn FES should contain those points of error in the auditing of a case which might cause the Pcfuture difficulty or may require handling. These would include rundowns left unflat or with missingsteps; signs of unflat grades; absence of any of the parts of EP, noting what was being run; any chronicproblem or difficulty; by-passed EP on any rundown; illness or ethics trouble after an auditing cycle.The most important points which can bog a case are well covered in the C/S Series, with whichan FESer should be familiar. In particular, anyone doing an FES must know very well C/S Series 1, 2,15, 19, 29, 30, 34, 38, 59. He must be able to recognize and pick out any of the case errors describedin the above issues.Anyone doing FES work must be thoroughly familiar with the GF40XRR. Anything on thecase which falls under any of the headings on this list should also be clearly noted in the FES, “Pc wasa member of black magic society” could be the thing which is stalling her case.WHAT ISN’T WANTEDAn FES is NOT the same as an FS. The 2 must not be combined or confused.Opinions have no part in FES.Do not note admin errors in an FES.Any error which is not part of the case or its auditing has no place on the FES.It can be the subject of a chit or separate report.Examples of this would be: “Auditor did not fill in the Folder Summary” or “Pc not beingaudited on any program” or “No-one C/Sing the folder”.Statements which R/Sed, and Ev Purps given off by the Pc are not usually noted in an FES.THE FACT THAT HE DOES R/S, OR DOES GIVE OFF EV PURPS MUST BE NOTED ON THELEFT-HAND EDGE OF THE PC’S TOPMOST PROGRAM.R/S statements (which the Pc said that R/Sed when he said it) and Ev Purps are noted on thePgm in red ink and may be noted on the FS.Dianetic chains that did not go to EP, flows not run, are noted on a Full Flow Table, not on theFES. The fact that a series of items was run F1 only, or did not EP, is noted on the FES, to bemarked off when corrected.A C/S and his FES unit work closely together and the C/S would usually apprentice thesepeople until they can very rapidly and accurately FES even a thick folder.Revised by Marion KimmichFlag Tech Comps I/Cfor W/O Ron Shafran, CS—4Approved byBDCS:RS:MK:nt jhCommodore’s Staff Aides andCopyright © 1972, 1975the Board of Issuesby L.

When the invoice indicating final payment of service is received, all relatedinvoices for that person and service are pulled out of the alphabetical AP files andstapled to the final payment invoice, and the name and date of expected arrival postedup on a board in Tech Services.

He is actually incapable of generatingvery much or as-ising very much.An individual considers himself mesty or massy and therefore he has to have asecond terminal. A second terminal is required to discharge the energy.Here we have two poles. We have an auditor and a pc and as long as the auditoraudits and the pc replies we get an exchange of energy from the pc’s point of view.Many auditors think they are being a second terminal to the degree that they pickup the somatics and illnesses of the pc. Actually there is no backflow of any kind thathits the auditor but if he is so convinced that he is mest he will turn on somatics in echoof the pc. Actually nothing hits the auditor, it has to be mocked up or envisioned byhim.You have set up in essence a two pole system and that will bring about an as-isingof mass.It isn’t burning the mass, it is as-ising the mass and that’s why there is nothinghitting the auditor.Now that is the essence of the situation. The magic involved in auditing iscontained in the communication cycle of auditing. You see now you are handling theSMOOTH INTERCHANGE BETWEEN THESE TWO POLES.When you look over the difficulties of auditing realize that you are handlingsimply the difficulties of the communication cycle and when you yourself as the auditordo not permit A SMOOTH FLOW BETWEEN YOU AS A TERMINAL AND THE PCAS A TERMINAL, AND THE PC AS A TERMINAL BACK TO YOU, you get a noas-ising of mass. So you don’t get TA action.Part of the trick of course is what has to be as-ised and how do you go about it,but that we call technique—(what button has to be pressed). We find, oddly enough, ifthe auditor is actually capable of making the pc willing to talk to him, he wouldn’t haveto hit a button to get tone arm action. (He cannot make the pc get tone arm actionbasically because a communication cycle doesn’t exist )63"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The person who is insisting continuously upon a new technique is neglecting thebasic tool of his auditing which is the communication cycle of auditing.When the communication cycle does not exist in an auditing session we get thishorrible compounding of a felony of trying to get a technique to work but the techniquecannot be administered because there is no communication cycle to administer it.Basic auditing is called basic auditing because it goes PRIOR to the technique.A communication cycle must exist before the technique can exist.The fundamental entrance to the case is not on a level of the technique but is on alevel of the communication cycle.Communication is simply a familiarization process based on reach and withdraw.When you speak to a pc you are reaching. When you cease to speak you arewithdrawing. When he hears you, he’s at that moment a bit withdrawn but then hereaches toward you with the answer.You’ll see him go into a withdraw while he thinks it all over. Then he reaches thereason. Now he will reach the auditor with the reason and he will say that was it.You have made an exchange from the pc to the auditor and will see it reflect onthe meter because that exchange now is giving an as-ising of energy.IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT COMMUNICATION YOU DO NOT GETMETER ACTION.So THE FUNDAMENTAL OF AUDITING IS THE COMMUNICATIONCYCLE.

To get into communication with that which you are trying to process.2. Do something for him.There is many a pc who will go around raving about his auditor, whose auditor hasnot done anything for the pc. All that has happened is that a tremendous communicationline has been established with the pc and this is so novel and so strange to the pc that hethen considers that something miraculous has occurred.Something miraculous has occurred but in this particular instance the auditor hastotally neglected why he formed that communication line in the first place. He formed itin the first place to do something for the pc.He very often mistakes the fact that he has formed a communication line, and thereaction on the pc for his having formed one, with having done something for the pc.There are two stages.1. Form a communication line.2. Do something for the pc.Those are the two distinct stages. It is something like (1) Walking up to the bus, and(2) Driving off. If you don’t drive off you never go anyplace.It is a very tricky and no small thing to be able to communicate to a human beingwho has never been communicated to before. This is quite remarkable, and is such aremarkable feat that it appears to be an end-all of Scientology to some.But you see that’s just walking up to the bus. Now you have got to go someplace.Any upset that the individual has is so poised, it is so delicately balanced, that it isdifficult to maintain. /t is not difficult to get well. It is very hard to remain batty. A fellowhas to work at it.If your communication line is very good and very smooth and if your auditingdiscipline is perfect so you don’t upset this communication line and if you just made aforay of no more importance than saying something like—What are you doing that’ssensible and why is it sensible?—and kept your communication line up all the while andkept your affinity up with the pc all the while, did it with perfect discipline, you would seemore aberration fall to pieces per square inch than you ever thought could exist.Now that’s what I mean when I say do something for the pc.65"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"You must audit well, get perfect discipline and get your communication cycle in.Don’t ARC Break the pc, let your cycles of action complete.All of that is simply an entrance. You see, the discipline of Scientology makes itpossible to do this, and one of the reasons why other fields of the mind never gotanyplace and could never get near anybody was because they couldn’t communicate toanybody.So that discipline is important.That is the ladder that goes up to the door and if you can’t get to the door youcan’t do anything.The perfect discipline of which we speak, the perfect communication cycle, theperfect auditor presence, perfect meter reading—all of these things are just to get you in astate where you can do something for somebody.So when you’re real slow picking up the discipline, real slow picking up keeping inthe communication cycle, when you’re pokey on the subject you are still 9 miles fromthe ball. You’re not even attending yet.What you want to be able to do is audit perfectly. By that we mean keep in acommunication cycle, be able to approach the pc, be able to talk to the pc, and be able tomaintain the ARC. Get the pc to give you answers to your questions. Be able to read ameter and get the reactions.All of those things have to be awfully good because it’s very difficult to get acommunication line in to somebody anyway. They all have to be present and they allhave to be perfect. If they are all present and they are all perfect, then we can start toprocess somebody. THEN we can start to process somebody.I’m giving you an entrance point here of, if all your cycles were perfect, if youwere able to sit there and confront the pc and meter that pc and keep your auditing reportand do all these multiple various things, and keep a pleasant smile on your face and notchop his communication, well then there is something you do with these things. It takes aprocess now.We used to have it all backwards. We used to try and teach people what they coulddo for somebody. But they could never get in communication with him to do it, sotherefore you had failures in processing.The most elementary procedure would be—’’What do you think is sensible?”—oranything of that sort. The pc says, “Well, I think horses sleep in beds. That’s sensible. ‘‘The auditor says, “Alright. Now why is that sensible?” The pc says, “Well ... ah .... Hey! .. . That’s not sensible. That’s nuts!”’ You actually wouldn’t have to do anything morethan that He’s cognited. You’ve flattened it. It’s so easy to do, but you keep looking forsome magic.Well, your magic is in getting into communication with the person. The rest is veryeasy to do, all you have to do is remain in communication with the person while you aredoing this, and realize that these huge aberrations he’s got are poised with the mostfantastically delicate balance on little pinheads. All you have to do is to phooph andthese things crash.Now if you’re not in communication with this person he doesn’t cognite. He takesit as an accusative action. He tries to justify thinking that way. He tries to make himselflook good to you and tries to put on a public front of some kind or another. He tries tohold up his status.Anytime I see a bunch of pcs around who want to jump happily to something elsebecause sane people run on that and crazy people run on something else, and they neverhave to be run on the crazy one, I right away know their auditors are not incommunication with them and that auditing discipline itself has broken down because thepc is trying to justify himself and trying to uphold his own status. So he must bedefending himself against the auditor.The auditor couldn’t possibly be in communication with him.66"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"So we are right back to the fundamental of why didn’t the auditor get into commwith the pc in the first place.You get into communication with the pc in the first place by doing properScientology discipline. That is not any trick. It goes off 1, 2, 3, 4.You sit down and you start the session and you start handling the pc and hisproblems and that sort of thing and you DO IT BY COMPLETING YOURCOMMUNICATION CYCLES AND NOT CUTTING HIS COMMUNICATION—THEVERY THINGS YOU ARE TAUGHT IN THE TRs, and you find you are in communicationwith the person. Now you’ve got to do something for the person.Unless, having gotten into communication, you do something for the person, youlose your communication line because the R-Factor of why you’re in communicationwith the pc breaks down. He doesn’t think you’re so good, and you go out ofcommunication with him. That having happened, the person will be in a sort of statusdefensive and wonder why he is being processed.On the other hand, if you have done something for the pc and he has had hiscognition, and you try and go on and get more TA action out of the fact that “all horsessleep in beds”—you don’t get there as you’ve already flattened the process.You can over-audit and you can under-audit.If you don’t notice that one answer come your way, that indicates you have donesomething for the pc and if you keep him working on that same thing, your TA actionwill disappear, your pc will get resentful and you’ll lose your communication line.He’s already had the cognition you see. You are now restimulating the pc. Youhave gotten your key-out destimulation factor—it has occurred right before your eyes.You have done something for the pc. One more mention of the subject and you’ve had it.There are a lot of things you could do with the pc, without doing anything for him.You can turn on some very very handsome somatics on a pc at one time or anotherwithout turning them off either. You’ve got to do something for the pc, not to him.Now you can be doing something (A), and the pc is doing (B), and you go ondoing (A), while the pc is doing (B) then somewhere on down the line you wind up in ahell of a mess and you wonder what happened.Well the pc never did what you said so you didn’t do anything for the pc. Therewas in actual fact no barrier to your willingness to do something for the pc but there musthave been a tremendous barrier to your understanding of what was going on.That you could ask (A), while the pc answered (B), in itself showed the auditorobservation was very poor so therefore the auditor wasn‘t in communication with the pc.So again the communication factor was out and once more we weren’t doinganything for the pc.It requires of the auditor discipline to keep in his communication line. He has got tostay in communication with his pc. Those cycles have got to be perfect. He can’t bedistracting the pc’s attention onto the TA, e.g. “I’m not getting any TA action now.”That’s not staying in communication with the pc—has nothing to do with it. You’redistracting the pc from his own zones and areas.Don’t put the pc’s attention out of session. Keep him going and keep thatcommunication line in. And the next requirement is to do something productive for thepc using the communication line.L. RON HUBBARDFounderLRH:nt.jhCopyright © 1971, 1974by L.

The first is the Pc’s line to his bank. The Itsa Maker line.2. The second is the Pc’s line to the Auditor. The Itsa line.3. The third is the Auditor’s line to the Pc. The What’s-it line.Now the definition, “Willing to talk to the Auditor”, is very easy to interpret as“Talking to the Auditor”. So the Auditor cuts the line the Pc has to the bank in order toget the Pc to talk, because “It’s the Itsa line that blows the charge,” he says.So the Auditor cuts the Pc’s communication line with his bank in order to bringabout an Itsa line—and then he wonders why he gets no TA action and why the PcARC Breaks.This cut communication line is not perceivable to the naked eye. It’s hiddenbecause it’s from the Pc—a Thetan unseen by the Auditor—to the Pc’s bank—unseenby the Auditor.The Auditor is simply there to use the What’s-it line in order to get the Pc toconfront his bank. The charge blows off it to the degree that it’s confronted and this isrepresented by the Itsa line.The Itsa line is a report on what has been as-ised, that gives it its flow.The sequence of use of these lines in an auditing cycle is 3, 1, and then 2.Where the Auditor neglects this hidden line from the Pc to the Pc’s bank, wherehe doesn’t understand that hidden line and can’t integrate it or do anything with it he isgoing to fail.

The only thing that connectsthem and makes an auditing cycle, is the fact that the Auditor, on his communicationcycle, has calculatingly restimulated something in the Pc which is then discharged bythe Pc’s communication cycle.What the Auditor has said has caused a restimulation and then the Pc needs toanswer the question to get rid of the restimulation.If the Pc does not answer the question he doesn’t get rid of the restimulation. Thatis the game that is being played in an auditing cycle and that is the entirety of the game.(Some auditing breaks down because the Auditor is unwilling to restimulate the Pc.)There is a little extra communication cycle on here. The Auditor says, “Thankyou” and you have this as the acknowledgement cycle.C ------------------------- Command --------------------> EAuditor E <---------------------------Answer------------------------ C PcE --------------------- Acknowledgement --------------->ENow there are some little inner cycles that can throw you off and make you thinkthat there are some other things to the auditing cycle. There is another little shadowcycle: it is the observation of “Has the Pc received the auditing command?” This is sucha tiny “cause” that nearly all Auditors who are having any trouble finding out what’sgoing on with the Pc are missing this one. “Does he receive it?” Actually there isanother cause in here and you’re missing that one when you’re not perceiving the Pc.69"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"You can tell by looking at the Pc that he didn’t hear or understand what you’dsaid or that he was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving.Whatever that message is in response, it rides on this line.Did Pc receive,e <------------------------understand and-------------------canswer command?C ------------------------- Command --------------------> EAuditor E <---------------------------Answer------------------------ C PcE --------------------- Acknowledgement --------------->EAn Auditor who isn’t watching a Pc at all never notices a Pc who isn’t receivingor understanding the auditing command. Then all of a sudden somewhere along the linethere is an ARC Break and then we do assessments and we patch up the session and allkinds of things go wrong.Well, they actually needn’t ever have gone wrong in the first place if this line hadbeen in. What is the Pc doing completely aside from answering? Well, what he is doingis this other little sub-cause, distance, effect line.Another of these tiny lines is the cause, distance, effect line of—”Is the Pc readyto receive an auditing command?”This is the Pc causing and it rides up the line across distance, is received at theAuditor and the Auditor perceives that the Pc is doing something else.It is an important one and you find that Auditors goof that one very often; the Pc’sattention is still on a prior action.Now here’s another one—”Has the Pc received the acknowledgement?”Sometimes you violate this one. You have been acknowledging but you’ve never seenthat he didn’t receive the acknowledgement. That perception has another little tiny onein it that actually comes on this line; it is—’’Has the Pc answered everything?’’The Auditor is watching the Pc and the Auditor sees that the Pc has not said allthat the Pc is going to say. You sometimes get into trouble with Pcs that way.Everything at “cause” hasn’t moved on down the line to effect and you haven’tperceived all of the “effect” and you go into the acknowledgement one before this linehas completed itself.That’s chopping the Pc’s communication. You didn’t let the communication cycleflow to its complete end. The acknowledgement takes place and of course it can’t gothrough as it’s an inflowing line and it jams right there on the Pc’s incompleteoutflowing answer line.Is Pc readye <----------------------for the command?-------------------cDid Pc receive,e <------------------------understand and-------------------canswer command?C ------------------------- Command --------------------> EAuditor E <---------------------------Answer------------------------ C PcE --------------------- Acknowledgement --------------->E70"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"So if you want to break it all down, there are six communication cycles whichmake up one auditing cycle. Six, not more than six unless you start running intotrouble. If you violate one of these six communication lines you of course are going toget into trouble which causes a mish-mash of one kind or another.There is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle and that is at thepoint of the Pc. It’s a little additional one and it’s between the Pc and himself. This ishim talking to him. You’re listening to the inside of his skull when you’re examining it./t actually can be multiple as it depends upon the complications of the mind.This happens to be the least important of all the actions except when it isn’t beingdone. And of course it’s the hardest to detect when it isn’t being done. Pc says: “Yes.‘‘ Now what has the Pc said yes to? And sometimes you are insufficiently curious. Andthat in essence is this internal perception of line. It includes this cause, distance, effectbackflash here—’’Is the Pc answering the command I gave him?’’So with this, there are seven communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle.It is a multiple cycle.A communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect with intention,attention, duplication and understanding. How many of these are there in one auditingcycle? You’d have to answer that with how many principal ones there are because someauditing cycles contain a few more. If a Pc indicates that he didn’t get the command(cause, distance, effect), the Auditor would give a repeat of it (cause, distance, effect)and that would add 2 more communication cycles to the auditing cycle, so you’ve got9—because there was a flub. So anything unusual that happens in a session adds to thenumber of communication cycles in the auditing cycle, but they are still all part of theauditing cycle.Repetitive commands as an auditing cycle, is doing the same cycle over and overagain.Now there is a completely different cycle inside the same pattern. The Pc is goingto originate and it’s got nothing to do with the auditing cycle. The only thing they havein common is that they both use communication cycles. But this is brand new. The Pcsays something that is not germane to what the Auditor is saying or doing and youactually have to be alert for this happening at any time and the way to prepare for it isjust to realize that it can happen at any time and just go into the drill that handles it.Don’t get it confused with the drill that you have as an auditing cycle. Consider it itsown drill. You shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected.And, by the way, this handles such a thing as the Pc originates by throwing downthe cans. That’s still an origin. It has nothing to do with the auditing cycle. Maybe theauditing cycle went to pieces and this origination cycle came in. Well, the auditing cyclecan’t complete because this origin cycle is now here. That doesn’t mean that this originhas precedence or dominance but it can start and take place and have to be finished offbefore the auditing cycle can resume.So this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause, distance, effect. The Pc causessomething. The Auditor now has to originate as the Auditor has to understand what thePc is talking about—and then acknowledge. And to the degree that it is hard tounderstand, you have the cause, distance, effect of the Auditor trying to clarify thisthing; and every time he asks a question, he’s got a new communication cycle.You can’t put a machine action at that point because the thing has to beunderstood. And this must be done in such a way that the Pc isn’t merely repeatinghis same origination or the Pc will go frantic. He’ll go frantic because he can’t get offthat line—he’s stuck in time and it really upsets him. So the Auditor has to be able tounderstand what the devil the Pc is talking about. And there’s really no substitute forsimply trying to understand it.71"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"There is a little line where the Pc indicates he is going to say something. This is aline (cause, distance, effect) that comes before the origination takes place so you don’trun into a jam and you don’t give the auditing command. The effect at the Auditor’spoint is to shut up and let him. There can be another little line (cause, distance, effect)where the Auditor indicates he is listening. Then there is the origination, the Auditor’sacknowledgement of it and then there is the perception of the fact that the Pc receivedthe acknowledgement.That’s your origination cycle.An Auditor should draw all these communication cycles out on a scrap of paper.Just take a look at all these things; mock up a session and all of a sudden it will becomevery straight how these things are and you won’t have a couple of them jammed up.What’s mainly wrong with your auditing cycle is that you have confused a couple ofcommunication cycles to such a degree that you don’t differentiate that they exist.That’s why you sometimes chop a Pc who is trying to answer the question.You know whether the Pc has answered the question or not. How did you know?Even if it’s telepathy it’s cause, distance, effect. It doesn’t matter how thatcommunication took place, you know whether he’s answered the command by acommunication cycle. I don’t care how you sense this.If you are nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing and if that’sgiving you trouble (and if you get into trouble by suddenly breaking it down andanalyzing it) then it should be broken down and analyzed at a time when you’reauditing something nice and simple.I’ve given you a general pattern for an auditing cycle; maybe in working it overyou can find a couple of extra communication cycles in the thing. But they are all thereand if you made someone go through each one painstakingly, you would find outwhere his auditing cycle is jammed up. It isn’t necessarily jammed up on his ability tosay “Thank you”. It may very well be jammed up in another quarter.L. RON HUBBARDFounderLRH:nt jhCopyright ©1971, 1974by L.

If you know yourcommunication cycle is good you haven’t any longer got to be upset about whetheryou’re doing it right or not. You know yours is good, so you don’t worry about it anymore.In actual auditing, the communication cycle that you watch is the pc’s. Yourbusiness is the communication cycle and responses of the pc.This is what makes the auditor who can crack any case and when absent you havean auditor who couldn’t crack an egg if he stepped on it.This is the difference, it’s whether or not this auditor can observe thecommunication cycle of the pc and repair its various lapses.It’s so simple.It simply consists of asking a question that the pc can answer, and then observingthat the pc answers it, and when the pc has answered it, observing that the pc hascompleted the answer to it and is through answering it. Then give him theacknowledgement. Then give him something else to do. You can ask the same questionor you can ask another question.Asking the pc a question he can answer involves clearing the auditing command.You also ask it of the pc so that the pc can hear it and knows what he’s being asked.When the pc answers the question be bright enough to know that the pc isanswering that question and not some other question.You have to develop a sensitivity—when did the pc finish answering what you’veasked. You can tell when the pc has finished. It’s a piece of knowingness. He looks73"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"like he’s finished and he feels like he’s finished. It’s part sense; it’s part his vocalintonation; but it’s an instinct that you develop.

Like—”You have now found and located the by-passed charge in answer to thequestion and you have said it.” That’s the magic of acknowledgement.If you don’t have that sensitivity for when the pc is finished answering—heanswers, gets nothing from you, you sit there and look at him, his social machinerygoes into action, he gets onto self auditing and you get no TA action.The degree of stop you put on your acknowledgement is also your good sensebecause you can acknowledge a pc so hard that you finish the session right there.It’s all very well to do this sort of thing in training and it’s forgivable, but NOT inan auditing session.Get your own communication cycle sufficiently well repaired that you don’t haveto worry about it after training.

Imagine my making one on the Comm Formula after allthese years.Do people ever explain to you long after you have understood?Do people get cross with you when they are trying to tell you something?If so, you are suffering from Premature Acknowledgement.Like body odor and bad breath, it is not conducive to social happiness. But youdon’t use Lifebuoy soap or Listerine to cure it, you use a proper comm formula.When you “coax” a person to talk after he has begun with a nod or a low “yes”you ack, make him forget, then make him believe you haven’t got it and then make himtell you at GREAT length. He feels bad and doesn’t cognite and may ARC Break.Try it out. Have somebody tell you about something and then encourage before hehas completely told you all.THAT’S why pcs Itsa on and on and on and on with no gain. The auditorprematurely acknowledged. THAT’S why pcs get cross “for no reason”. The auditor hasprematurely and unwittingly acknowledged. THAT’S why one feels dull when talking tocertain people. They prematurely acknowledge. That’s why one thinks another isstupid—that person prematurely acknowledges.The quickest way to become a social pariah (dog) is to prematurely acknowledge.One can do it in many ways.The quickest way to start the longest conversation is to prematurely acknowledgefor the person believes he has not been understood and so begins to explain at greaterand greater length.So this was the hidden ARC Break maker, the cognition wrecker, the stupidifier, theItsa prolonger in sessions.And why some people believe others are stupid or don’t understand.Any habit of agreeable noises and nods can be mistaken for acknowledgement,ends cycle on the speaker, causes him to forget, feel dull, believe the listener is stupid, getcross, get exhausted explaining and ARC Break. The missed withhold is inadvertent. Onedidn’t get a chance to say what one was going to say because one was stopped bypremature acknowledgement. Result, missed w/h in the speaker, with all its consequences.This can be counted on to make you feel frightened of being “agreeable withnoises or gestures” for a bit and then you’ll get it straight.What a piece of tech to remain incompletely explained.

He isn’t well. Analysts had people talk forfive years and they seldom got well.So how is it supposed to happen today that a pc, let talk enough, will get well.It won’t.The auditor does not know the very basics of auditing skills. That’s all. These arethe TRs.An auditor who can’t do his TRs can’t audit. Period.Instead he says he is “letting the pc Itsa”.If by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches,then this isn’t auditing.In auditing an auditor guides. He gives the pc something to answer. When the pcanswers the pc has said “IT IS A ..“ and that’s Itsa.If the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go intoan anxiety—he has been chopped. So he talks more than he wanted.If the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge, then the pc talks on andon, hoping for an acknowledgement that doesn’t come, “runs dry”, tries again, etc.So premature or late-or-never acks result in the same thing—the pc running onand on and on.And they call it “letting the pc Itsa”.

(The one single exception is the pc who had years in analysisbut even he begins to get better with proper TRs used on him.)The proper cure is to drill the auditor until the auditor realizes:1. The auditor asks the questions.2. The pc says what is the answer, “It’s a ........”3. The auditor acks when the pc has said it to the pc’s satisfaction and4. The auditor acks when the pc has finished saying “It’s a .......”And that’s Itsa.Scientology auditing is a precision skill, not a gag blop goo slup guck blah.1. The auditor wants to know ........2.

So he or she simply sits like a lump ofsacking hoping the pc will say something that makes the pc feel better.A sure sign that an auditor doesn’t know an engram from a cow about processesis seeing a pc “Itsa” on and on and on.In Scientology we do know what the mind is, what a being is, what goes wrongin the mind and how to correct it.We aren’t psychoanalysts or psychiatrists or Harley Street witch doctors. We doknow.The data about beings and life is there in Scientology to be learned.It isn’t “our idea” of how things are, or “our opinion of” ....Scientology is a precision subject. It has axioms. Like geometry. Two equilateraltriangles aren’t similar because Euclid said so. They’re similar because they are. If youdon’t believe it, look at them.There isn’t a single datum in Scientology that can’t be proven as precisely asteacups are teacups and not saucepans.Now if we get a person fresh out of the study of “the mystical metaphysics ofCuffbah” he’s going to have trouble. His pcs are going to “Itsa” their heads off andnever get well or better or anything. Because that person doesn’t know Scientology butthinks it’s all imprecise opinion.The news about Scientology is that it put the study of the mind into the preciseexact sciences. If one doesn’t know that, one’s pcs “Itsa” by the hour for one doesn’tknow what he is handling that he is calling “a pc”.By my definition, an auditor is a real auditor when his or her pcs DON’T overtalkor undertalk but answer the auditing question and happily now and then originate.79"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"So how to tell an auditor, how to determine if you have trained one at last, is DOHIS PCS ANSWER UP OR DO THEY TALK ON AND ON.If I had an auditor in an HGC whose pcs yapped and yapped and ran dry andyapped while the auditor just sat there like a Chinese pilot frozen on the controls, Iwould do the following to that “auditor”:1.

He is always trying to findsomething wrong with the pc. That’s the nature of Scientology; we assume that there issomething wrong with somebody otherwise he wouldn’t be here and be dead in hishead, and he would be capable of doing a great deal more than he is doing at theparticular moment.An individual is basically and routinely good, capable of many actions andconsiderable power.In the state of a Free Thetan or Native State he is a far more powerful individualthan when he’s been complicated up.It’s the idea of the additive data to the Thetan. Try to give somebody somethinghe doesn’t want and you are going to overthrow his power of choice. His power ofchoice is the only thing that he had to begin with, which gave him power, capabilityand anything else and that power of choice has been consistently and continuouslyoverthrown by giving him things he didn’t want and taking away from him things hedidn’t want to get rid of back and forth. You get the individual pretty overwhelmed andhe goes down in power.What happened to him actually is he solved something that didn’t need solving.There was something he couldn’t confront so he solved it and he fixed the solution.Anytime you fix these solutions, for ever and ever you put the individual downgrade. An individual becomes aberrated by additives. His experiences in this universeare usually calculated to degrade and depower him. Now all you have to do is pick upall of these criss-crosses and you return him to power.Man is an added-to being and everything that has been added to him hasdecreased his ability to cope. When you add something to the Being he gets worse.We are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual.Even the Freudian Analyst realized that some additive had been added that shouldbe deleted. So the idea of deleting something to bring about a recovery is not new withus.Because we are in the business of deleting wrongnesses from the individual weseldom look at rightnesses and that’s what’s wrong with most auditors. They are soanxious to find the wrongness—and quite properly—and they never really look at therightness. If they don’t look at the rightnesses that are present, then they aren’tappreciating the degrees of truth that are present that can be promoted into more truth.82"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"In other words they are starting at a level of no truth present all the time so ofcourse they never make any forward progress.You must realize that there must be truth present and that this truth must berecognized and that this is hand-in-glove a part of auditing—the recognition of the factthat truth is present.If you only look for wrongnesses and only recognize wrongnesses then you willnever be able to pull anything up a gradient because you won’t think you have anyrightnesses to work with. It just all looks wrong to you.You have to be able to look at the wrongnesses in order to right them but we alsohave to be able to look at the rightnesses in order to increase them.We are only trying to find wrongnesses in order to increase rightnesses, andthat’s very important. If you have no rightnesses present in a session you will never beable to make any progress of any kind. Progress is built on a gradient scale ofrightnesses by which you delete wrongnesses and they drop and fall away.Therefore, Processing is an action by which wrongnesses can be deleted from thecase to the degree that rightnesses are present in the session. You cannot take a case thatdoesn’t have any rightness present and delete a wrongness. So you have to realize thatthere are rightnesses present and then you increase those rightnesses That makes itpossible for you to pick up the wrongnesses and that’s what auditing consists of.Auditing is a contest of maintaining rightnesses so that we can deletewrongnesses. If you keep on deleting wrongnesses, all the while maintaining andincreasing the rightnesses you eventually wind up with a very right being. You aretrying to get a right being, therefore if you don’t continually encourage right beingnessyou never wind up with a right being.You must learn to observe an auditing session. You want your pc to wind up in aright state—in a more native, more capable, less overwhelmed, higher power of choicesort of state. You want him to wind up with more rightnesses.Therefore, if you audit so that you do not encourage and increase rightnesses thenyou won’t wind up with a right pc.The degree of rightness you have present must exceed the wrongness you aregoing to pick up. It’s a proportional action. If you’ve got as much wrongness in asession as you’ve got rightness you’re not riding on any cushion. It makes a verydifficult job of auditing. If you want to pick up this little wrongness, you have to haverightnesses present which are big enough to engulf it. That makes easy auditing.If the rightnesses in the session are very minor and the problem is a tiny one,there isn’t enough rightness in the session to handle the problem and the pc cannoterase it.THE PC’S ABILITY TO AS-IS OR ERASE IN A SESSION IS DIRECTLYPROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER OF GOOD INDICATORS PRESENT IN THESESSION.And his inability to cope in a session rises proportionally to the number of badindicators present in a session.Any process has its own series of bad indicators. And the bad indicator moves inwhen the good indicator moves out So you have to have a primary knowledge of goodindicators.Don’t look for bad indicators on and on and on; you’ll drive the pc around thebend and suppress the good indicators What you want to do is know your goodindicators for the level you are running so well that when one of them disappears out of83"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"the session, your ears go up and you instantly look for the bad indicator. Don’t look forthe bad indicator until you see the vanishment of the good indicator. Otherwise you’recontinually prowling around looking for wrongnesses in a session and you keep a pcvery upset and you get no auditing done of any kind whatsoever.Remember this next time you see a pc start to bog and drag and flounder one wayor the other. You’ve got to get the pc’s good indicators back in before you can get thepc to handle what you want him to handle.What influences the attitude of the pc is an ARC Break (that of course isinfluenced earlier by the auditor’s behavior), or the pc has an overt on the auditor or thepc has a missed withhold.An auditor who never gets in and finds out what is wrong in the session—thereasonable auditor—messes up pcs like mad.If all the good indicators are present the auditor knows he is doing a good job ofauditing.LRH: nt .rd L.

Heshould handle only causes— as basic as he can get. Then he sets the fellow back on theroad.Cramming requires individual, skilled attention by someone who is willing to 2-Way Comm and knows the subject under discussion well enough to be able to findwhere specific points are covered.Cramming’s purpose is to teach the student what he’s missed.To do that, it must handle both why he missed it and what was missed.Stable Data:1. Things are CAUSED, they do not “just happen”.2. The cause lies earlier than the effect.3. It is not “human to err” nor is it reasonable to forget things nor are there peoplewho are “naturally slow”.4. Though stupidity comes in general from charge on the case, thoroughlyremarkable changes can be effected in rate and thoroughness of data assimilation,independent of general auditing, by use of study technology.5. Basic, when blown, discharges the rest of the chain; Basic is earlier.In practice, the “why” of a suddenly slowed rate of study or of an overt productcan be found and gotten rid of by looking just before the change and fixing up whatyou find. (Sometimes one has to carry the matter earlier, especially in the case ofimproving a study rate that is generally slow.)RESULTSAnother Stable Datum is: If it didn’t resolve the situation, it wasn’t the right cause of it.You don’t know what was bogging the guy until you find it—it’s easy to evaluate whatyou think must be wrong with the guy or sell your wins or cogs . . . but it’s very hardon the guy you’re cramming.87"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The route to 100% results on the students is persistence in finding the actualcause. Hammering the same point over and over just doesn’t find the cause of arepeating error (and there shouldn’t even be the first error, if he did the courseproperly). When he’s found (not you’ve found, when he’s found) what’s out, you’llhave as many VGIs as you could ask for and the error will not repeat.LOG BOOKKeep a log book giving the date and name of student, reason sent to Cramming.This gives a good idea of how the student is doing.PROGRAMThe Cramming Officer gets into 2-Way Comm with the student to estimate whatneeds to be done, and lines up a short program of steps to be taken in Cramming. Thisis done in duplicate. The original is handed to the student. The Cramming Officerretains the duplicate for his record and so he can trace the student’s progress, and bringit to a rapid completion. The students should be kept busy.GRAPH TRENDGo over the student’s daily graph of study stats and from the point of downwardtrend, check the checksheet for what was being studied at that time, or just before.CRAMMING TECHThe standard of just taking the Bulletin he’s hung up on and asking for a missedword in the previous Bulletin (or previous Section of the Bulletin) works great andoften simply this would handle the situation.Whatever it is, it is something, and there are a finite number of things it can be.Frequently the student will offer a word and then half withdraw it—yet usuallyit’s the very first one he offers when asked. So when you ask for a word, take what’soffered . . . all too often the word the guy hung up on is one he almost believes, orfully believes, he knows.BASIC TOOLYour most basic tool is the full “cycle of the misunderstood”. A very large part ofthe time you have to use the whole thing.Say you’re cramming an Auditor who’s just goofed. C/S has sent him toCramming on R3R steps, as in the middle of session he started dropping commands.Your first task is to find what exactly occurred. There can be bad admin or othervarieties of false reports.Then why that occurred, looking earlier. In many cases something else precededgross obvious goofs. He did the course, he’s got no right ever to goof that data.Aha! He wasn’t sure if he should have been running that item on the Pc ...seemed like a narrative.Now with the initial goof to hand you find the principle that wasn’t understood.On check, yep, he doesn’t understand what it’s OK to run or not to run in Dianetics.Aha, Aha! And what word or term? Yes, he doesn’t know what “narrative”means.Clay Demo of “narrative” (full demo—not “can somebody guess”) after looking itup . . . a checkout on a couple of HCO Bs . . . and the guy’s in business. Then you88"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"can assess how much restudy of what is needed and groove him in to not omitcommands even when flustered. Now he can learn, and will apply.OTHER TOOLSAll standard study tech is at your disposal; HCOB Feb 21, 66, “DefinitionProcesses”, HC Stress Analysis, etc., will get many a student out of the soup bythemselves.Frequently a student proves to be pushed too far along the gradient and simplyneeds to be put back, to the proper slot. Often all mass and doingness get left aside andonly theory gets done—the guy never got an E-Meter or looked at a Pc. Sometimes theguy’s programmed onto the wrong course entirely—completely without a purpose onthe one he’s on.WHEN SIMPLY ASKING FOR A MISSED WORDDRAWS A BLANKSometimes he can’t spot one offhand.You can simply ask for the prior area the fellow feels “weak in” or “disagreeswith” or “feels unsure of” and from that easily get the missed term. Clay of termswhich the guy missed and hung up on helps a lot—whether in the present or a previoussimilar subject.This approach works very well when cramming in relation to a subject involvingonly activity, where there was no particular study of printed matter associated with it.WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE NO EARLIERCounter-Policy and Counter-Tech come into this. Frequently the guy “knows” thedata but also “knows” something else that is either directly misunderstood or the resultof a misunderstood. There’s no obvious earlier error, he just all the time erroneouslyomits the R3R step despite having been checked out . . . obviously if it’s simply amatter of “Gee! I never saw that before,” your job is easy and the Why is simply didn’tdo the material in the first place.But say the Exec did the course, but still won’t ever train his staff. He’s full ofapparent comprehension, but doesn’t apply.Well there’s the overt—won’t train—yet he feels he’s doing right or he wouldn’tbe doing it. Fine, your approach is, “Why was what you did the right thing to do inthose circumstances?” (“What made it OK to commit the overt?”) “One’s got to copeand get the product out.” “Good, what’s the policy covering that that you’re using—getme a copy, please.”You take the policy he’s using as the reason (whether an actual Policy, Bulletin,or someone’s order, or even an “everybody knows” from Psychology) and find theprinciple not understood and the word missed that led to the misunderstanding andyou’re back in business. Maybe, above, it turns out the guy didn’t know he shouldhave set someone to organize behind him and finally didn’t know what “product” meantat all.Repaired, the guy will now at last both cope and train.SLOW STUDENTSOften subjects studied earlier (and usually blown from) have to be addressed.E.g. One student couldn’t seem to get or find his misunderstood on the Ethics Sectionof OEC. This was traced back to a term he’d never understood while studying law, andmagically he suddenly understood the Ethics Policies he was studying.89"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Sometimes the student has gone past 20-30 misunderstoods, and each one has tobe defined. E.g. One student had never completed his HSDC because he “couldn’t readDMSMH”. He’d gone 1/3 way through and utterly bogged. After defining word afterword he hadn’t understood, with the student getting brighter and brighter, he suddenlystated—”Hey, it’s easy to read now.”CRAMMING AUDITORSThe first thing to do is to go over the C/S, the session, the C/S comments andCramming actions to be done. Trace back misunderstoods to basic and from thatindicate which HCO B(s) to restudy on.Often the Auditor will originate another area of uncertainty. Take these up too andhandle each one.OTHER STANDARD TOOLSStudent Rescue Intensives sometimes are a life-saver.The Learning Drill, even Op Pro by Dup (with C/S OK), TRs 0-9 and all sorts ofdrills as issued (e.g. 101-104) assist. TR errors are as fundamental errors as you canget on an Auditor—except perhaps, can he sit in the chair?THE COURSESA large part of the Cramming Officer’s responsibility lies in correcting the coursesthat trained the guy being crammed. If it had been run all that standardly you’d not haveexpected the fellow to wind up in Cramming.Sometimes the student himself isn’t at fault at all—common course outnesseswhich the Cramming Officer may have to see corrected before students can getanywhere are:1. No Supervisor.2. No materials.3. No checksheet.4. Improper checksheet.5. No checkouts available.6. All theory, or perhaps Theory with demos or clay substituted for an actualPractical section.7. No Supervisor 2-Way Comm in use. (Nothing mystic here just no one talks toanyone. )8. Evaluated tech, e.g. by Supervisor or fellow student.9. Uneducated Supervisors, in general—not using or applying the Study Techthemselves.10. Bad equipment, especially tape recorders.11. Student has never done the Student Hat, not knowing Study Tech at all himself.Doesn’t know how to study and so never learns anything!The Cramming Officer, in the face of Course and Supervisor outnesses, asabove, must firstly unbug the student and get him winning again, then call in theSupervisor or Supervisors involved and get them corrected. In the case of a Course90"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Admin who can’t maintain the tape recorders, he is pulled in and fully corrected in thisarea.SUPERVISION AND C/SVery often the student is having difficulty because of poor supervision. He wouldbe learning well and progressing if the Supervisor were better trained or crammed.The same situation could exist with the C/S—he may need training andcramming.This should not be overlooked by a Cramming Officer who sees too manystudents or Auditors being sent for the same difficulties.It is the Cramming Officer’s responsibility to keep Supervisors and C/Ses trainedas well.THE STUDENT HATThe Cramming Officer may find that the student has never learned how to be astudent. He was never hatted— never got an R-Factor on what was expected of him asa student. It is simple to get him hatted with the Student Hat.This does not apply only to students in Tech Training and Technical Personnelbut to Admin Students as well. Staff Personnel on Admin Courses, Staff Status, OEC,Hats, are also students and require Hatting and Cramming. They should not beneglected by the Cramming Officer.COACHING TO A NO WINOccasionally you will find a coach who can’t give himself or another a win. Hecoaches toward a loss. This could go so far as to not let himself progress just to keephis fellow student back. Or he may never let his fellow student pass—or pass himwhen he doesn’t deserve it.This could require auditing to resolve. But a good Cramming Officer can handlethis by finding the Why and getting it handled. And find the area he has losses on andget the misunderstoods off.INVALIDATION AND CORRECTING THE WRONG WHYOne barrier to study is the conviction that a right datum is wrong or not to beapplied. The only resolution to this is finding and pulling off whatever or however itgot invalidated and then rapid restudy of the area.A student ordered to “restudy his Finance Pack because ‘he doesn’t know hisfinance policy’ “ will profit from the study best after the Why is located specifically andstraightened up. Once he’s found, say, his misunderstood in “how to do payroll” hecan then study the rest of the pack in staff study with profit and certainty. A restudywithout finding what’s out tends to leave him in doubt about all his comprehension ofthe materials and he ends up more uncertain of the materials than before, unless hehappens to spot the exact error in the course of the general review.THERE IS A CAUSEPersistence is probably the keynote. Since, (a) HE CAN DO IT, and (b)sometimes the first thing you find and well handle does not resolve the situation, then(c) THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE AWRY TOO.You follow each cycle to a VGI/Cog. A VGI/Cog doesn’t necessarily resolve thewhole show, but it ends an action. Sometimes you get a good change as “My God, youknow I’ve never really known what an F/N was” or “You know, I’ve always avoided91"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Finance Policy and don’t really understand it at all.” That does end that action. But thenyou still have to find the misunderstoods in the Policy, and drill, checkout, etc.BASICSThe most common misunderstoods of Tech Students and Students on AdminCourses alike lie in the Basics— METERING, TRs, UNDERSTANDING OF THEAUDITOR’S CODE, THE BASIC THEORY OF THE HUMAN MIND, STRICTHONESTY AND HONOR AS AN AUDITOR.These are the things the student should learn early and what a good CrammingOfficer always looks for, because if the student did not learn them early in histraining—or if he had had an earlier than Scientology Misunderstood—his later trainingwill hang up somewhere.The Cramming Officer should check for things like:What is the Mind?What is Charge?What is the Time Track?What happens when something keys in?What happens when something keys out—or erases?What is it that makes the meter read?What is mass?Questions like this should be asked and good Demos done. Then the CrammingOfficer can go earlier and earlier. He may find the misunderstood in earlier subjectsalgebra, science, philosophy, simple multiplication, it could be anywhere; and theCramming Officer tracks it down.TRs, METERING, AUDITOR’S CODE, THE AUDITOR’S INTEGRITY AREDRILLED SO THAT THEY APPLY TO THE SESSIONS THE AUDITOR RUNS.The student or Auditor will cognite that these are for use and not just for drilling.The Cramming Officer is there to unbug the Auditor and student—wherever thebug or flaw may be. It must be tracked down to basic and cleared up.Every Org must have a good Cramming Officer. Without a Cramming Officer,auditing and training are not kept at the high quality our Tech requires.A good Cramming Officer is one of the Org’s most valuable personnel.Compiled and written from Flag Cramming and Qual Sec actions byReissued as BTB byFlag Mission 1234I/C: CPO Andrea Lewis2nd: Molly HarlowCommodore’s Staff Aides Approved by the Board of IssuesBDCS:BofI:AL:MH:JZ:JR:GE:JF:LM:mh for theCopyright © 1971, 1974BOARDS OF DIRECTORSby L.

Ensure the Cramming Order handles the Why, is short and written in sequence ofgradient handling, including basics.E. See that the misunderstoods are cleaned up back to the BASICS (e.g. errorshandling out Ruds traced back through Basic Auditing Series to the Auditor’sCode). Always use WC 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 in addition to starrates and clay.F. Have the Auditor drill the procedure flubbed until flawless.G. Have the Auditor do TRs 0-4 (6-9 if necessary), debugging individual TRs on agradient of perfection.H. If a chronic error, metering error or low hours, check over his meter position, eyesand his handling of the meter, and OT TR 0 and TR 0 particularly.I.

Show me.b. Tell me.c. Obnosis.d. What happened just before that?SHOW MEIn many instances, if a person is asked what was done, he will not report exactlywhat was done, so a Cramming Off should get a person to SHOW him what he did.A Cramming Off has to hand a Cramming Order. His first action is to get theperson to demonstrate by going through the motions. In many cases, he won’t have to goany further because the demonstration will immediately show what was wrong andrequiring correction.For example, an Interne is having trouble with assessment, but a simpledemonstration shows that he does not know how to set up for a session. He has his Meterway over to the left, the worksheets in the center and the assessment sheet way over to hisright, and thus cannot see the list, the Meter and the Pc all in one field of vision. Such ademo can take one minute and save a Cramming Off 20 minutes of digging.In Admin Cramming, Show Me can take the Cramming Off into the StaffMember’s area.TELL MEWhen Show Me is not possible, have the person tell what happened. “Exactly whatdid you do?” is a stable datum. Get the exact sequence of events not a lot of ramble. Ifvery confused have the person use a Demo Kit. Don’t get caught up in reasons orexplanations.OBNOSISThe Cramming Officer must be able to pick out the outnesses in what is being saidor shown. One doesn’t have to be an expert to recognize and follow down something thatdoesn’t make sense.WHAT HAPPENED JUST BEFORE THAT?In some cases, particularly in the Tech Cramming area, the Cramming Off will haveto find out what happened just before the goof.When checking for what happened just before a goof, the Cramming Off will findA. something he didn’t understand, and/or B. something he couldn’t control.A new Interne flubs the commands of R3R. Now, if the Cramming Off doesn’t askwhat happened just before that, he may miss out on his Why. He will probably find outthat the Interne realized he was running out of paper, or some such common incidence,which caused him to become flustered, TRs to go out, and he flubbed the commands. Inthis case, through his own lack of planning and set-up actions, the Interne lost control ofthe session. So the Cramming Off will cram the Interne on session set-up actions andstrengthen his TR 0 through the use of TRs booklets and tapes and see that he continuesdaily TRs Training on the Interneship.When a look into a situation does not readily show up a Why, go earlier and findout what happened.ETHICSThe only hidden barrier to real success in Cramming is non-participation, theindicator of Out Ethics. A Cramming Off must recognize Out Ethics and get it handled.He may be able to get the Staff Member to handle it on the spot, or he may have to sendthe person to Ethics or even to Integrity Processing. The point is to recognize the barrierto progress and get it removed.94"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"SUPERVISOR CRAMMINGUnless Qual is also correcting Training where needful, Cramming will beoverloaded with flubbed products who didn’t get the data in the first place and are nowgoofing on their Tech or Admin post.The Qual Sec should inspect Course rooms daily.

Do they do daily TRs?Are blown students immediately contacted, brought in and handled?Can the Supervisor “see” what is happening in the Classroom? Can he handle whathe sees?Any Supervisor with down stats, drop-outs, blows or slow students must become baitfor a continuing correction program until the standard is way up and into an acceptablelevel.The value of a good Academy or HSDC Supervisor, who runs snap and popcourses, gets his students through rapidly and thoroughly is extremely high. In this case,he is personally worth about two times that of a top HGC Auditor in terms of beans intothe Org. HAS and HQS Course Supers prove their worth in future beans and re-sign-upsin the Org. They help to create future business in the Academy and the HGC. Therefore,proven top Supervisors should not be ignored as areas of facility differential.A Supervisor is handled in Cramming like any other person in for correction. TheSituation is located, the Why found and the handling for that Why executed. There aremany such Situations and Whys to be found on most to get them to a point of beingflubless Supervisors.

Tech Cramming.2. Admin Cramming.There are two basic types of Cramming:A. To rapidly prepare a person for post or technical action, through intensivestudy, Word Clearing and drilling on key materials.B. To rapidly correct a person after the fact of an error or flub, by finding theWhy, and handling that Why with study and Word Clearing of the particulardata involved and drilling the actions to a point of confidence andcompetence. This covers Cramming Orders sent to Qual or originated by theCramming Off or Qual Sec on Outpoints in the Org.The administrative and executive staff of an Org require Cramming as much astechnical personnel. The handlings are analogous.The cycle goes like this:1. Hat checksheet completed in staff training.2. Cramming ordered when a staff member flubs.3. Cramming to find and handle the basic reason for the continued flubs, if present.4. Ethics, if proven necessary, to no change or improvement or refusal to becorrected, overtly or covertly.Post duties break down into various skills just as they do for Auditors or C/Ses orCourse Supervisors.Sources for Admin staff correction break down into:A. Basics of Scientology as applied in life—ARC, cycles of action, eight Dynamics,etc.B. Staff Member Basics—Staff Status 0, 1, 2, OEC Volume 0, Org Bd.96"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"C. Post Hat—Mini Hat, Full Hat.D. OEC Volumes by Division. All Policy.The Admin Cramming Off has a vested interest in seeing that Staff Training existsand produces hatted staff members who can do their post duties competently. Wherestaff training is lacking, he must work with the Qual Sec and STO to get it intooperation.The steps of handling an Admin Cramming cycle are:1. Find out what happened or is happening.2. Establish the situation (biggest departure from what should have happened orshould be happening).3. Find the why for that situation on a meter.4. Write up the handling to eradicate the why and get a return towards the IdealScene by Cramming on the key issues for the area and removing any blocks totheir implementation.ORG OUTPOINTSIn doing Org outpoint corrections per HCO PL 30 Aug 74, “Qual Stat Change”,look at the GDSes first. Take up any and all GDSes with down stats or trend, and cramall personnel directly involved with making the GDS on visible outpoints until the statstarts going up. That means keep on correcting outpoints, by pushing in Policy andTech until you get a stat recovery occurring. Then take up the Dept stats and get themgoing up. Then take up the Section stats and get them going up. Checking on statsbefore doing Org outpoint correct actions narrows the target to the areas needingcorrection.There are sometimes more areas which can cause trouble than a Cramming Officermay realize. These separate out into:1. Staff member’s actions, flubs and misunderstoods.2. Senior’s actions and reports. (Supplementary Situation per Data Series 27, HCOPL 25 May 73, “Supplementary Evaluations”.)3. Other staff influences. (Supplementary Situation per Data Series 27, HCO PL 25May 73, “Supplementary Evaluations”.)4. Out Basics in Scn, staff or post hat duties.5. Out Personal Ethics.6. Environmental influence.

Wrong purpose or products or products unknown.The Cramming Officer does not do all the handling on staff but gets the person towork with other staff in Cramming or bring in fellow staff to work with and theCramming Off sees that each step is done correctly.97"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The only test of successful Admin Cramming is that those staff crammed are nowdoing better and their stats are up.Ideally, an Admin Cramming Officer should be an HPCSC/OEC Graduate.

Watch out for Auditors who cannot orwill not do two hours of confront or Auditors who cannot deliver 2l/2 hours of auditingand short session. Be on the lookout for Supervisors whose students blow or whohave small classroom attendance.The Interne Supervisor is responsible for forcing in daily TRs on Auditors,Internes, C/Ses, Cramming Officer, Pc Examiner, Word Clearers, Basic CoursesSupervisors, Success Officer, D of P and D of T.Auditors and Internes get their TRs training done outside of production hours andtime must be provided daily for this to be done. Each personnel may not be preventedfrom doing daily TRs. Technical reports show that some Auditors do not get in theirminimum 25 WD hours showing the vital need for lots of TRs to be done. Poorscheduling keeps Auditors waiting, and unnecessarily lengthens their auditing day,leaving no time for daily TRs. Daily TRs and Auditor and Interne training times actuallyreduce time in Cramming.

A failed Auditor on post will only result in failedcorrection cycles. Another Cramming Officer is appointed to handle students and admincramming cycles. This has been proven a successful action.The Cramming Officer keeps a log book of all Cramming actions done andweekly reviews the types of Cramming actions going on with the different Auditors.He could find at this point that a certain Auditor has been crammed on three slightlydifferent but related areas. He can, at this point, call the Auditor in and handle the morebasic outness isolated.Packs of materials to do with a subject or action should be compiled forCramming—e.g. Rudiments, Listing and Nulling, TRs, etc. If an Auditor goofs onRudiments, he reviews the little pack, word clears it, drills the actions, etc.Word Clearing is used very heavily in Cramming. Auditors are not “sent to WordClearing” when it is required. They are just twinned up and word clear the materialsordered in Cramming. If a student is consistently goofing on data contained in aparticular level or course, he can be ordered to word clear the entire materials on thatchecksheet in Cramming.When certain materials have already been word cleared and the student is stillgoofing on the procedure, it must be considered that he has a confusion re thesequences of actions and the student must be very heavily drilled on that action.The Cramming Officer has the whole resources of the Org Library to call upon.Many books contain key data applicable to every level and these should be usedliberally in Cramming.If an Auditor is showing ignorance of a datum or rule, it is quite possible that henever read it.The three main areas investigated in Cramming are:1. The student or Auditor never read it.The exact data may not have been on an earlier checksheet done on a subject. Soone always ensures that all the data is to hand and reviewed.104"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"2. The student or Auditor has misunderstoods in the material.Handled fully with Word Clearing, always on the whole text of the materialsgoofed.3. The student or Interne has confusions on the sequences of actions.Handled by drilling. Can also be handled by HC lists.One point that the Cramming Officer must watch out for is overlong CrammingOrders. An overlong Cramming Order would be one that contained more than four orfive issues. Such a Cramming Order is actually a training cycle and should be done instaff training. Overlong Cramming cycles tend to bring about a backlog because theycannot be handled quickly and completed. Qual is a corrective Division and should notget into routine training actions. Routine training belongs in the Tech Division. TheCramming Officer does NOT accept overlong Cramming Orders.NO F/N AT EXAMSPer C/S Series 86RB, BTB 20 Jan 73RB, “The Red Tag Line”, the Examinersends a copy of the list of the day’s Red Tags to the Cramming Officer.A Red Tag Pc report must lead at once to Cramming of the Auditor, the D of P,the C/S and the Tech Sec. They are immediately crammed on the appropriate materialswith all Mis-U words cleared up and any Why found on the meter as needful.Any discovered instance of a non-F/N VGIs folder not being relayed to the C/S,and thus discovered by the Cramming Officer, must result in an immediate EthicsHearing for No Report.

It is part of theCramming Officer’s responsibility to prevent Wrong Target correction. According toQual Senior Datum, the Cramming Officer must not take orders but must do his owninvestigation and handling. It will be found that there is usually a valid corrective actionto be made.

But heaudited the Pc in a room that was overhot and the cans were too big. He has beendrilled on Auditor’s Code and session environment handling and HCO Bs on TAErrors and now has this down pat. It won’t happen again,” leaves the C/S in no doubtas to what really happened. What’s more he can order this repaired on the Pc by a “2wcon times he felt worried about his TA or F/Ns” taken E/Sim to F/N (which will clear itup).Furthermore the Auditor now knows that the C/S knows what the real error was,doesn’t get hung with a withhold or a false idea about his TRs from the C/S.In essence one is putting the Exact Truth on the line.So the following rule is now mandatory in all HGCs and Quals:THE CRAMMING OFFICER IS ALWAYS ON ANY CRAMMING ORDER TOREPORT THE EXACT OUTNESSES FOUND OR THE EXACT SESSION GOOFS,WITH ANY ADDITIONAL DATA, IN DETAIL, TO THE C/S.A C/S receiving a Cramming Order back giving no Why or an unreal Why thatdoes not make sense when compared with the session and its results MUST return theCramming Slip to the Cramming Officer requiring the Why be found or the wrong Whyabandoned and the real Why found and corrected.A good C/S should know his Data Series down cold and be able to spot suchoutpoints at once.

The Qual Sec and Org Officer must be alert to this or the area will getjammed and production lines slowed.The target being worked towards is:1. A Class VIII or IX Ex Dn HPCSC Tech Cramming Officer.2. A Class IV OEC HPCSC Admin Cramming Officer.Then you would really see the fur fly. As these levels of post training areacquired, we will see a gradient and continual improvement in the tech and adminquality, existence of Source and use of materials of Dianetics and Scientology in Orgs.Orgs will become fully On Tech, On Policy and In Ethics and will be trulyKEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING.

Admin Cramming is vital to pick up, revitalize and get afloundering Division, area or Org on its feet and operating.Word Clearing plays a key role in Cramming, so there must always be aminimum of two Word Clearers in any Org. If an enterprising Qual Sec wants to getsome Word Clearers, his best action would be to word clear the HAS and all HCO staffon their posts and duties until they get the message on the value of Word Clearing. AnyQual Sec who has no Word Clearers or Word Clearing being done in his Div should beordered to extensive Word Clearing by his CO or ED, and then crammed in his ownQual on his hat.Cramming is not an area for weaklings or persons with no confront. It isprobably one of the single most versatile posts in an Org. He has all types of staff withall types of flubs and outnesses to handle. He must use every skill he has, every pieceof knowledge about Scientology and Dianetics, every piece of Policy, to handle hiseveryday work cycles. Any piece of tech by LRH, if a relevant handling for thesituation, is grist for the mill of a Cramming Officer.A good Cramming Officer, who uses all the tools of Qual to get his product, isworth his weight in gold.

Staff member refuses to do the Cramming Orders through post overwhelmor incorrect Cramming Orders not corrected by the Cramming Officer, thusviolation of Qual Senior Datum.B. Staff member has done the Cramming Orders to apparent GIs and F/N buthas not been fully honest in Cramming, thus causing by-passed Whys andpost inefficiency. This person is glib and lacks confront.C. Staff member was never Crammed in the first place.There is a way out which can unlock the situation, enable the real data to belocated, so the Why or Whys can be found and handled.THE METHODThis method works in Tech and Admin Cramming quite efficiently, if thoroughlyand honestly done.1. Tell the person what you are going to do. Get his agreement to proceed and beassured of his participation.2. Get the person to write up a full list of all done or not done Cramming Orders,with exact specifics, and all outnesses listed separately. Details may have to beobtained from the Cramming Log Book. Every time something is repeated, put aslash alongside the item.3. Now ask the person to write up any other Off Policy or Out Tech actions beingdone or not done on post which have not been picked up.4. Add these to the original list, putting a slash every time an item is repeated.116"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"5. Now work with the staff member to group the outnesses together by subject area,level or basic.A. Tech personnel outnesses will sort out into training levels or into basics ofauditing, course or case supervision, as applicable.B. Admin staff outnesses will sort out into staff member basics, key hat duties,Scn basics and other categories listed in BTB 7 June 73 RA, “AdminCramming”.6. Add up all the slashes of the combined items. This will locate the Major Situation,as the one with the greatest number of slashes, and the Minor Situations, theremainder in order of number of slashes.7. Take up the Major Situation and indicate this to the staff member. This shouldbring in VGIs. If not, go back and redo the above steps, adding any missed data,until you do get VGIs.8. Now find the Why for the Major Situation. This must bring in VGIs. The WhyFinding is done on the Meter.9. Work out a Handling for the Why which will handle the hell out of it.10. Get the Handling done immediately.11. When the Handling has been completed, send the staff member to the PcExaminer. If no F/N VGIs, find the right Why and complete the Handlingindicated by the right Why.12. End off the Handling of the Major Situation to F/N VGIs.13. Now take up the Minor Situations in order of greatest number of slashes, and findeach Why and handle separately.14. There can be an EP to this action. The person has a tremendous resurgence ofpost efficiency, stats and morale and he is doing well again. End off theCramming at that point, but see that remaining Situations and Whys are handledeither in Interne or staff training.This action can be done on an old-time Auditor who is anxious to return toauditing, in order to clean up the past major areas of failure. An old HPA/HCA couldget this action done in Cramming, for a fee, of course, prior to doing an AcademyRetrain.The Cramming Officer must be familiar with all the tools he has at his disposal forthe handling: HC List, Slow Eval Assessment, C/S 78 Wrong Why FindingCorrection, Word Clearing, TRs, Admin TRs, Reach and Withdraw, 3 May 72 PL,C/S 53RI, PTS Tech, confront of MEST and work areas, various study and staffcorrection lists, Pre-PCRD assessment, disagreement checks, Integrity Processing,writing drill, plus the entirety of the Technology and Policy and Books of Dianetics andScientology.In working with lists which contain training and auditing correction actions, therelevant training correction actions are done in Qual and the Assessment form is routedto the Pc folder for the auditing actions needed to be done and Staff C/S advised.Do not buy case reasons as Whys for staff member post flubs. There are alwayspost or staff reasons for flubs. However, if the Cramming Officer finds that staff on hislines are mis-audited or not audited, he should chit the D of P and Staff Training Officerfor failure to take responsibility for seeing that staff get regular Intensives on arotational basis, and that staff members in trouble do have their folders checked for OutTech and do get corrected.117"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"When it is found that the staff member never studied or checked out on key dataor post hat material in the first place, the correct Cramming handling is to cram in thekey material so the person can now function, and see that a post training program iswritten up by Pers Programmer and done in staff training.The one to five steps in the method above do not take more than a half to one hourat the most.Do not hesitate to use TRs and drills on staff members in Admin Cramming. Theyneed TRs and drilling as much as Tech personnel.WHAT TO DO WITH THE STAFF MEMBER WHOHAS NEVER BEEN CRAMMED IN THEFIRST PLACEAs Admin Cramming starts being used more regularly in Orgs, CrammingOfficers will find themselves with bogged staff who have never had any Cramming. Hewill then be handling an actual backlog situation which is unexpressed.In this case, he should get a write-up from the Div Head involved of exactly howthis person has been operating and the outnesses observed. The Cramming Officershould then get the person himself to write up what he considers that he has been or hasnot been doing, plus a write-up of exactly what post training the person has had TheCramming Off goes over the data with the person and they sort out and group theoutnesses as found, thus locating the key outness to be handled. For this person, thehandling will be what will rapidly handle the Why found and enable the person tofunction on post. This action must be followed by an immediate post program by thePersonnel Programmer and completed in staff training.The Cramming Off must report Div Heads who won’t cram their staff to the QualSec for Cramming correction orders on the Div Heads themselves.The steps of this Bulletin are remarkably efficient in locating major hidden areasof outness in order to be able to handle them. The hardest part in handling a personwho is badly bogged is just where do you start? These steps give an exact sequence todo this and are incredibly easy to do.  Ens.

Cramming a person over a problemor W/H will produce no change so no correction will occur.Out ruds are easy to spot. The person with an ARC Break, won’t talk or ismisemotional or antagonistic. A problem produces fixated attention that preventsCramming from finding the actual area of difficulty. Natter and 1.1 remarks means awithhold.Recently a musician being crammed kept bringing up a dispatch that he was inmystery about concerning the group. Every time it was mentioned it read or BDed yetthe Cramming Officer continued “Cramming” him and never handled it. So no product.I sat the musician down, told him he was crammed over a problem, the mysteryabout the dispatch, cleaned it up by getting the dispatch and letting him go over it, madesure the problem was handled then found the area of misunderstood and traced it backto an early age and the Why fell right out.And I got the Cramming Officer crammed by the Senior C/S and found her Whytoo.So the moral of the story is DON’T CRAM OVER OUT RUDS.It is too costly in lost production and flaps.CRAMMING OFFICER FLUBSWhen the Cramming Officer flubs you must get him crammed fast because he willrepeat the error on others and there goes your results.In such cases, get him crammed immediately by the Qual Sec or Senior C/S. If itis the Qual Sec who has flubbed, then he is crammed either by the Senior C/S or theKeeper of Tech.INCOMPLETE HANDLINGIt is often not enough just to correct a Why and do no further handling inCramming. Most Cramming Cycles reveal a broader area of situation which must alsobe handled.An example is the Auditor who flubs on an L4BR and during the Crammingreveals he never really listened to the key SHSBC L&N tapes.119"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Cramming Officer who does not also program the Auditor for a review ofthose tapes would not have fully corrected that Auditor. You could accurately predictfuture L&N flubs and pc upsets.A subsequent program such as the one above would count as an additionalCramming Cycle for the Cramming Officer, or a Retread if lengthy and would count asadditional points.Therefore the maxim of Cramming is:HANDLE THE HELL OUT OF IT.Honest correction must be fully and completely done for the sake of the publicand the org as well as the staff member.SUMMARYCramming success depends on not Cramming over out ruds and on fully handlingall areas of confusion or weakness.Follow these operating rules and you will enjoy rave results and real correction.And your org stats will soar.

EXAMPLE: In LRH ED 1 74R INT the WHY of failures in Techand Admin areas was found to be “STUDY TECH NOT IN USE FOR INDIVIDUALWHYS FOR EACH SUPERVISOR AND STUDENT”. A similar example existswhere tapes with Scientology materials were not in full or proper use, the WHY being“TAPES WITH SCIENTOLOGY MATERIALS NOT IN USE FOR ANINDIVIDUAL WHY FOR EACH ORG PERSON CONCERNED”. In each case, thetech of finding the individual WHY is necessary to handling the broad WHY.This tech is contained in the DATA SERIES PLs and is restated here in brief formfor finding the WHY on a person.STEPS1. Know the Data Series PLs. (Don’t have any misunderstood words on them.)2. Work out exactly what the person should be producing.3. Work out the ideal scene.4. Investigate the existing scene.OBSERVE THE SCENE around the person for outpoints related to what theperson SHOULD be doing in an Ideal Scene.Verify that there is a situation with that individual and that you know what thesituation is. Don’t go trying to find the WHY of a no situation. (A bad situation ismeasured by the difference between existing scene and an Ideal Scene and threatto Ideal Scene.)5. Ask the person exact specific questions pertaining to the situation.6. Do not at any time ask the person for the WHY. If the person knew the WHY,the situation wouldn’t exist.7. Use the comm formula and get your questions answered. Don’t be diverted by theperson’s “reasons”.122"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"8. Note all outpoints.9. Be alert for the area(s) with the most outpoints which relate to the situation.10. Verify the data by looking This will often reveal the major outpoint which leads tothe WHY. It must be realized that you are often looking for an OMITTEDsomething, hence a knowledge of the Ideal Scene and product is required.11. When you find a major outpoint, trace down the chain of outpoints to the WHY.Pull the string by asking more questions in the area of the Major Outpoint.12. The big crashing outpoint that explains all the other outpoints will be the WHY.13. The WHY must have something to do with the person. If not, you will have a“Why is God” and it won’t resolve.14. Indicate the WHY to the person. Correct WHYs result in Cogs and VGIs. Awrong WHY can make the person feel degraded, will not bring in VGIs and willnot lead to a resolution of the situation.15. Look over existing resources.16. Get a Bright Idea of how to handle.17. Handle or recommend handling so that it stays handled. The handling of theWHY must directly relate to the WHY that was found.EXAMPLES1. Situation: Supervisor not using study tech.Investigation: Supervisor was observed, found to be very casual with students.No 8-C. Supervisor questioned. All outpoints in area of Supervisor not wanting to tellstudents what to do and himself not liking to be told what to do.WHY: Big button on control and does not want to control others. WHY wasindicated with cognitions and VGIs after initial HE&R on the subject.Handling: Objective processes especially SCS.2. Situation: Student taking forever on study of tapes.Investigation: Observed student transcribing tapes so he could later look up thewords. Didn’t know why you don’t go past a misunderstood word.WHY: Never studied the study tech.Handling: Primary Rundown.3. Situation: Staff member not doing his job. Ineffective on post.Investigation: Found out what the person was doing. Found he was given andhad been doing the functions of another post.WHY: Accepting illegal orders.Handling: Offload of extraneous functions. Word Clear relevant PLs.4. Situation: Folder Page backlogging folders. Not getting them through to C/S.123"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Investigation: Questioned Folder Page to find her product. Found it was a C/S notoverloaded with folders.WHY: Working for a wrong product. Didn’t know required product.Handling: Product Rundown.5. Situation: D of P not doing standard duties. Letting Pcs stall on lines.Investigation: Checked hat and flow chart. Found flow chart had been done butnever referred to and missing all the key points where Pcs can stall on lines. ExpectingPcs to arrive back at HGC of their own accord.WHY: Unawareness of lines and terminals and how they can be influenced.Handling: Line Drills (following pipes and flow lines in an engine room). Makeup correct flow chart and drill it.After finding the WHY and getting the handling implemented, the situation isagain reviewed to see if it still exists. If so, a wrong WHY was found. The Handling isto redo the steps and get the correct WHY. A WHY which cannot be handled or doesnot lead toward attainment of the Ideal Scene is of course a wrong WHY.The finding of individual WHYs on persons is normally a very fast action. TheWHY is simply found and the handling implemented.The more you do of them, the faster and more expert you become.METERED WHY FINDINGWhen Why Finding is done on a meter, the above steps still pertain; however,meter reads are used to help establish the situation and track down the WHY. Falls or aBD would indicate the right area. The correct WHY would result in F/N, Cog, VGIs.(At this point, you would indicate the WHY and continue with steps 14—16.)Metered Why Finding should end with an F/N. Worksheets are kept.After any Why Finding, metered or not, the person is sent to the Pc Examiner.The worksheets are routed to Tech Services so they can be filed in the person’s Pcfolder.Training & Services Aideand Dissem Aide  by order of  L.

A check for stability is also made after being audited on the PTSRundown.For this reason, HCO B 17 April 72 and all the checksheet of HCO P/L 31 May71 must be fully known to the Dianetic Specialist.HCO B 17 April 72 is also C/S Series 76 so as to be sure that Case Supervisorshandle the Admin and C/Sing correctly.

There are no sickpeople who are not PTS to someone or a group or something somewhere.A somewhat suppressive pc will find the good hats suppressive. This does not relieve hiscondition. He is PTS to SP people, groups, things or locations, no matter how SP he is.He can have been audited by someone he knew in an earlier life and who goofed the session. Afew auditors have since been declared. Not because they goofed but because they were SP.However, some PTS pc will make trouble for good people because that is what PTS means(Potential Trouble Source). So do not buy all the good people he is PTS to.Further, when you do get the person or group or thing or location the PTS person will F/N VGIand begin to get well.The PTS condition is actually a problem and a mystery and a withdrawal so it is sometimes hardto find and has to be specially processed (3 S&Ds) to locate it.Usually it is quite visible.Don’t have a sick, rollercoaster pc appear for Interview and then say “not PTS”. It’s a falsereport. It only means the Interviewer did not find it.The pc sometimes begins to list in such an Interview and such an Interview where a wrong itemis found has to be audited to complete the list or find the right item. (See C/S Series 78, HCO B 20Apr 72, Issue II.)So Interview worksheets are VITAL. The Interview should end on an F/N.The Interview is followed by the Ethics action of HCO PL 5 April 72 or other Ethics actionssuch as handling or disconnection and posting as called for in policy.An Interviewer has to use good TRs and operate his meter properly and know 2-way comm andPTS tech.Some Interviewers are extremely successful.Such Interviews and handling count as auditing hours.When properly done, plus good auditing on the PTS RD, well people result.LRH:mes.rdL.

One pc who had been on LSD for years had only a Ihour quickie drug rundown. Later this person relapsed.Tracing this, in each case the “Interest?” question had been used and the pc hadreplied “No interest” BUT MEANT “I’M NO LONGER INTERESTED IN DRUGS.”So Drug items that have read are run R3R without asking for interest. Thecommand is simply omitted.In Expanded Dianetics the same thing has occurred in running Evil Purposes orIntentions. The Auditor asked the pc if he was interested in running the item and the pcsaid “No” and so it went untouched. But the pc had it confused with interest in doing thepurpose and missed running it and then fell on his head later. Tracing the case back itwas found that R/Ses and such had not been run due to the pc saying “No Interest”.Nothing bad will happen if the item is run.C/S RESPONSIBILITYThe C/S must keep telling his auditors, on drugs or Expanded Dianetics, “Omitasking for interest on R3R on these (drug) (intentions). Run them if they read on themeter.”REPAIRIn repairing cases it is good sense to check this point on drugs and intentions to seeif they were neglected in R3R due to “no interest”.If so, then have them run and the case will suddenly do well.LRH:nt.ntm jh  L.

Theauditor asks if the pc is interested in running it. The pc says, “No.” The auditor does not run it.BANG, we have a BY-PASSED CASE.The pc will blow or go sour or not recover.One of these cases was unchanged after “a drug rundown”. He had a pair of eyes that looked likeblank discs. Check of folder showed all major drug items “not run due to no interest”. The solutionwas to recover the lists, run the items that had read R3R triple and complete the case.Another one blew. His folder was examined. Every evil purpose had been left unrun! Of theitems from the “Wants Handled Rundown” the intentions were mislisted. The drug rundown failed dueto “no interest”.Each flubbed case I am finding has had his drug items and evil purposes left unrun on R3R dueto “no interest”.So DON’T ASK FOR INTEREST ON INTENTIONS, EVIL PURPOSES AND DRUGITEMS.IF THEY READ, RUN THEM!REPAIR1.

Means a wildly PTS OUTOF VALENCE person on a wrong flow. The ‘SPs are in the org’, get it? Sohe’s outside the Org criticising the Org so ......Learn to audit-C/S cases by fundamentals not rules or orders. You wouldhave missed this product a mile. He’s still so PTS he’s out of valence and inan enemy valence. Those overts listed prove it.Requires a fast change of Pgm. I wondered where this case was at. Now Iknow. And so should you have.R-FACTOR: The next thing on your program is a 3 May 72 PL.1. 2wc ‘What do you have to say about that?’2. R-Factor: You are in Danger due to omissions.3. Step 1.4. Step 2. WC.5.

I did not want to gointo another action with the TA that high. He said he was feeling great nottired. (His sleep is irregular due to QM duties.)The pattern is usually the TA doesn’t start to climb until the first 20 minutesof the session or so. We should be able to handle this way:1. 2wc to F/N.2. Complete LRH C/S of 12.5.72.I don’t know where I am erring on this guy, but I’ll get him through it.LRH COMMENT AND C/S 13.5.72—“Oh well. With this many session errors you won’t make it.ANYBODY CAN AUDIT AN EASY PC. AN AUDITOR’S FLAWSSHOW UP GLARINGLY ONLY ON ROUGH PCS.As a Dn Spec will be auditing a lot of rough pcs he has to be flawless inTRs, metering and tech.The errors are obvious enough.1. You don’t begin a major action or an assessment list until you get anF/N. This is called set up. One has to know how to talk a TA down todo a HiLo. This holds true unless Int is out and that can be tested atonce by simply checking Went In? Exterior? at which you get a BD ifit’s what’s wrong and you just handle it. If it’s not Int you check lists.If not lists you check w/hs.Actually I can’t see how you’d get much of a read with a TA that high.Nevertheless a C/S 53RRR works even with a high TA.2. You tried to run an ARC Brk with a high TA. You checked it. YouNEVER touch ARC Brks on a High TA as High TA is not caused byARC Brks. And ARC Brks WILL NOT get a TA down and seriouslymesses up a pc if you try it.3. You are possibly assessing with a lilt—an upswing of tone as in aquestion. Assessments are done as a statement —a down tone. [Seefootnote p. 229]4. You have to have the pc’s attention. He has to be in session, thismeans interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor.5. To be in session a pc has to have confidence in his auditor and anauditor with overts on the pc or doubts or who makes funny cracksabout the pc’s items SHOWS IT IN SESSION and there goesconfidence. Because ARC is gone.6. An auditor’s tiny failures in TRs begin a grating on the pc. Thisthrows a pc out of session.7. The commonest cause of no item on an assessed list of prepared itemsis meter reading failure. The meter is placed wrongly so the auditorcan’t see it, pc and paper in ONE glance. This is the usual reason for‘no items’ on a prepared list. Eyesight can be a factor.224"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"8. An auditor has to have IMPINGEMENT on a pc to assess.

The lower class auditor just didn’t impinge (or missed the lot).There are NO pcs alive such as you are presenting here in this folder. Theydo not exist.Whenever in the past, we have thought one did we checked it out and therewas no such animal.There was an auditor whose TRs were poor, who couldn’t or didn’t read ameter and who had overts on the pc.The pc in question each time responded easily to standard auditing.You keep not doing C/Ses because you have not done the basic things.Anyone can run a Cadillac pc.

His only out is to try to stop something as he himself cannotstop living.This gives rise to fixed ideas as he is trying to stop—therefore the ideas hold intime and continue.His efforts to be right continue to stop him in a reverse flow.This is true because he is already at near total effect. He also becomes the effect ofhis own fixed idea efforts to handle.Just as a man being crushed by a house-size rock will still put his hands out tofend it off, so will a thetan continue to fend off his believed oppressions by stoppingthem.Insistence on rightness is a last refuge of beingness.

Thesehave been cancelled.I thought I’d better cover the developments since the original materials and clearup any questions or conflicts that may have arisen over the unauthorized HCO Bs.EXPANDED DIANETICS PROGRAMMINGExpanded Dianetics programming is not rote but each programme is laid out forthat individual pc taking him from his current state to a shiny product.The programme is worked out from data gotten by FES, OCA, Chart of HumanEvaluation and D of P Interviews.The product of an Ex Dn complete pc is visible by OCA, Chart of HumanEvaluation, and pc satisfaction in having handled what he wanted handled.Endless Ex Dn to no product occurs only when the C/S violates the basics of ExDn programming as covered in my tape lectures and the Case Histories, when the pc isrun on actions that he doesn’t need and aren’t reading or when the pc was not set up forEx Dn in the first place.EXPANDED DIANETICS SET-UPSUsually a C/S Series 53RF and a list correction are needed set-up actions if theyhaven’t been done. A thorough C/S-l and full word clearing are vital.A Drug RD must be done or completed before Ex Dn is done or it will fail. Thisincludes Objectives. You can’t do Ex Dn until Drugs are all handled.TROUBLE ON ENGRAMSThe pc who cannot run engrams has misunderstoods on the commands and termsof R3R and Dianetics, or it’s drugs. The pc will be able to run drugs because that’swhat he’s stuck in. He’ll run those automatically as long as you’ve done the necessaryWord Clearing.Pcs who won’t go backtrack are druggies or in recent shock of having died. Thisis handled by a thorough Drug RD and if necessary the usual Dianetic backtrackremedies As and Es double-assessed. Ss and Ps could be checked as well.251"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"LATER EX DN RUNDOWNSClass VIII C/S-6 list is useful in running out past bad auditing. It is fully coveredon Tape 1. Other Class VIII lists are not used as you won’t get anywhere running AEIsfrom a significance.Intentions in AEI Treble Assessments are run in order of read. Interest is notchecked. As intentions exist on all 3 flows you could list for the intentions on the other2 flows after you have listed the intentions connected with and run them R3R Triple.You can only list and run intentions connected with a terminal or mass or somatic nevera significance.The R3R commands are: F-1 ”Locate an incident of another causing you to havethe intention_____.” F-2 “Locate an incident of you causing another to have theintention_____.” F-3 “Locate an incident of others causing others to have the intention______.”Good Intentions are never run. Never. The cure for a pc who is run on a goodintention is a C/S Series 53RF. The cure for the auditor is to fully define the words:good, worthy, positive, pro-survival, evil, bad, unworthy, negative and contra-survival. Then have him re-study the related materials. If it recurs, get him audited on a3 May PL and Ex Dn.R3R all E. Purps culled from the folder is done as a first action in Ex Dn.Subsequent E. Purps brought up in sessions are noted and R3R’d later on in theprogramme before any PTS RD is done.These E. Purps have to be verified as to wording and checked for read beforerunning, but not interest.Considerable charge can be bypassed if E. Purps are missed so this action isthoroughly done.R/S Handling, also called the Responsibility RD, is done as OCA right-hand sidehandling. A list of all R/Sing statements is made then each taken up. The idea is an R/Swill occur in connection with a terminal which will read when checked, and that’s whatyou want to run. The R/Sing statement itself will often mention a terminal. If not theauditor can do a brief TWC to find out the terminal connected with the statement.Once the terminal is obtained the auditor lists (L & N) for the E. Purp F-l, 2 & 3R3R Triple on each after it’s listed.If no terminal can be found the auditor would have to L & N for the intention ofsomeone who would (R/S statement).The Wants Handled Rundown is shown in Cases B, C and F. The importantpoints of the RD are to run it as a “wants to get rid of”, not a “wants to achieve” and tocomplete each thing the pc wants handled before going on.Handling of each thing the pc wants handled is dictated by what the “thing” is. Asomatic is run R3R Triple. The intention connected with it can also be run. An intentionis run R3R Triple. If it’s a terminal, L & N for the intention connected with it and runit. You can also L & N and run the intentions on the other 2 flows. If it’s a condition L& N W/W would have it then list for and run that terminal’s intention. If it’s adoingness L & N for the intention of someone who would do that and run it.Additional handling could be done such as PSEAIs double-assessed R3R Triple,handling it as a problem by finding and running out the prior confusion or tracing itback to the earlier problem it is a solution to and running that R3R Triple. Difficultieson this RD stem from not getting the thing the pc really wants handled which will readvery well and run like a bomb, or errors in the L & N or R3R or out ethics holding thecondition in place.252"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The Multiple-Flow E. Purp Rundown is a very high-powered action which mustbe precisely done. Its use is covered in C/S Series 22 and Case C.

C/Sing and auditing are doneto achieve a product.When you’re paralleling the mind the meter will be reading like mad, the pc willbe wildly interested and the results will follow big and fast.With this broad change in Ex Dn I recommend that you re-listen to the Ex Dntapes, review DMSMH and The Original Thesis as well as the ‘63 Time Track and R3Rmaterials and re-study the Case Histories working out why each C/S and pgm wasdone. Better yet do a thorough Ex Dn C/S Course.I’m counting on you to really apply these materials and expect to see lots of goodresults.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:amsjhCopyright © 1974by L.

Where the item being listed is a significance the terminal must be found by L&Nand then the intention of that terminal listed.The procedure on AEIs where Intentions has the LARGEST READ would be toL&N for the intention, R3R Triple or Quad, then go on to As or Es or reassess.It is highly unlikely that Intentions will continue to read on reassessment of AEIs.If this does happen suspect a wrong list and verify or correct.It could read on an Intention on another flow, but then Intentions can be listedTriple or Quad.QUAD EX DNWhen catching up unrun Flow 0s on an Ex Dn completion it is usual to Quad theR3R items, leaving the L&N questions alone.

This is a withhold which anotherperson nearly found out about, leaving the person with the withhold in a state ofwondering whether his hidden deed is known or notINTEGRITY is defined as:1. The condition of having no part or element taken away or wanting; undivided orunbroken state; wholeness.2. The condition of not being marred or violated; unimpaired or uncorruptedcondition; soundness.3. Soundness or moral principle; the character of uncorrupted virtue, especially inrelation to truth and fair dealing; uprightness, honesty, sincerity.This relates to ETHICS which is defined as “the principles of right and wrongconduct and the specific moral choices to be made by the individual in his relationshipwith others”.Thus we see that a person who acts against his own moral codes and the mores ofthe group violates his integrity and is said to be out-ethics.Such acts are called overts. A person having committed an overt and thenwithholding the fact of that overt, and withholding himself from committing furtheroverts, will individuate from the group. The group itself will then lose integrity as itbecomes divided and lacks wholeness.Integrity Processing is therefore that processing which enables a person, withinthe reality of his own moral codes and those of the group, to reveal his overts so he nolonger requires to withhold and so enhances his own integrity and that of the group.DEVELOPMENTIn the ear/y ‘60s LRH developed the technology known as Sec Checking. Asissued it was used for two purposes: as a general processing tool to clean up a pc’soverts and withholds and as a security tool to detect out-ethics persons and securityrisks261"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"In 1970 this technology was refined and issued under the name of Confessionals.In 1972 a complete update was done of basic O/W tech and the earlier proceduresof Sec Checking and Confessionals. A new technology emerged—IntegrityProcessing.Recently Integrity Processing has been reviewed as to its workability and mostoptimum usage by LRH and certain revisions have been made.USAGEIntegrity Processing has two uses. Its basic use is as a tool for pc case gain,increase in responsibility and case progress. As such it belongs at Exp Grade II on theGrade Chart You can’t expect a pc with unhandled Drugs, who can’t communicatebecause others don’t really exist (Grade 0), and who is caved in by problems (Grade I)that he hasn’t even cognited on, to have enough responsibility to answer up on O/Ws(Grade II). Therefore, Integ as a full RD goes at Exp Grade II. It is usuallyprogrammed to be done at or towards the end of the Grade and a full battery of Integlists are used. It is not a mandatory Grade II Exp process, but is recommended.The second use of Integrity Processing is as an ethics or security measure. It isused here as part of staff requirements or when a security clearance is needed. As suchit has no case prerequisites and is not subject to such things as the Drug RD rule as it isnot being used for pc case gain. Only one or at most two Integ lists would be used.When used as an ethics or security measure, Integ can be done as auditing in asession (and is therefore subject to the Auditor’s Code), or can be done as a straightsecurity action, not “in session” In the case of the latter, the person must be informedthat he isn’t being audited. The technical procedure in either case would be the same.It is noted that use of Integ as a non-session security measure or in the case ofsevere out-ethics is rare, and nothing here condones misuse or abuse of IntegrityProcessing as a security or ethics action. Such misuse would be itself subject toimmediate and severe Ethics action as it would constitute an extreme betrayal of trustHISTORICAL PRECEDENCE—RELIGIOUS CONFESSIONThe need for a person to be able to morally cleanse himself by confession of sinshas long been recognized in religion.The Buddhist monk 2,500 years ago was permitted to confess and seek expiationfor “acts of censure”. The penalty for failure to confess was loss of the rights andprivileges of a monk. This was enforcement of the natural law that he who commitsactions against the codes or mores of the group separates himself from that group.The Bible, in the Books of James and John, calls for the confession of sins.Early Christian handling of confession was largely concerned with disciplinaryaspects. The sinner had to wear sackcloth, make his bed in ashes, and fast. This wenton for a time proportionate to the gravity of the offence, sometimes for years.Certain sins were previously considered too serious for forgiveness and thereforenot open to confession, but a gradual leniency developed as in the case of Calixtus,Bishop of Rome 217-222, who decided to admit adulterers to exomologesis (Greek forpublic confession).In the 4th Century at Rome and Constantinople we hear of “penitentiaries”—priests appointed to act for the Bishop in hearing the confession of sins and decidingwhether public discipline was necessary.Due to some misuse of public confession, individual private confession becamemore prominent in the 5th Century.262"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"In 1215 the Council of the Lateran ruled that everyone must make confession atleast once a year before his parish priest.In Confession as now administered in Christian Churches the disciplinarypenance is often little more than nominal, stress being laid rather on the fullness of theconfession.Thus for at least 2,500 years confession has played an important role in religiouspractice.Throughout the centuries two points of question have arisen which led to someunpopularity of confession. One was the possible misuse of information disclosed inpublic confession, hence the development of private confession before an authorizedperson whose code of conduct prevented misuse. The other was the infliction ofdisciplinary action as atonement for the sins confessed. But the latter goes beyond therealm of personal morals and ethics into justice. Confession itself, and the need forsome form of confession has not been in question.With Integrity Processing Scientology follows in the tradition of religion. Thisprocessing enables the individual to confess to overts without duress. It is done with aqualified Auditor bound by the Auditor’s Code. Disciplinary action forms no part of theprocessing.The technology by which Integrity Processing is delivered is new. It is not thesame as any earlier technology either in Scientology or other religion. It does howeverfollow in the longstanding tradition of religion in providing a means for the individualto admit to and take responsibility for transgression against the mores of the group andso regain a spiritual and moral integrity.Compiled from LRH briefingsand materialsReissued as BTB byFlag Mission 1234Revised byW/O Ron ShafranCS-4Approved byCommodore’s Staff AidesBoard of Issuesfor theBOARDS OF DIRECTORSBDCS:RS:AL:MG:BL:clb.rdof theCopyright © 1972,1974,1975CHURCHES OF SCIENTOLOGYby L.

The actualform question must be taken to F/N, not some other question.Here is the basic procedure for Integrity Processing:1. Set up the room, chairs, table, etc., as you would for any auditing session withall admin to hand, worksheet paper, Integ Form you will use, etc.2. Make sure your pc’s hands are not too dry or moist, the cans are the correct sizeand the pc knows how to hold them. Ref. False TA HCO Bs.3. Start the session and fly a Rud if no F/N. If TA high or low do not try to fly aRud but do a C/S Series 53RJ, assess and handle. If you are not trained in doinga C/S Series 53, end off for C/S instruction.4. Put in any needed R-Factor on doing Integrity Processing.5. Clear the procedure and the use of the buttons “suppress” and “false” etc. Ifnecessary as an example run a non-significant question to demonstrate theprocedure (e.g. Have you ever eaten an apple?).6. Take up the first question and clear the words backwards, then the full commandnoting any read while clearing, which is valid. See BTB 2 May 72R, “ClearingCommands”, and HCO B 28 Feb 71, C/S Series 24, “Metering Reading Items”.Then, as needed, groove in the question further by asking for the time period thequestion would cover, the activities and people that would be involved, etc. Thiswill steer the pc to the area and bring it into view.7. With good TR 1 give the pc the first question, keeping an eye on the meter andnoting any instant read. Even the smallest change of characteristic is checked inIntegrity Processing and that question taken up if it develops into an “SF”, “F”,“LF” or “LFBD”.8. Take up each reading question getting the who, what, when and where of everyovert, going earlier similar to F/N. Get specifics, not general or vague answers. Ifthe pc gives off another’s overt ask him if he ever did something like that. Youwant what the pc has done.9. TAKE THE ORIGINAL READING QUESTION TO F/N. Not some otherquestion. Always repeat the original question as part of the earlier similarcommand to keep the pc on that question.10. If the question does not read and does not F/N put in Suppress on the question(and if necessary Invalidate, Abandoned, Not-Is, etc.) asking, “On the264"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"question______has anything been suppressed?” and noting any instant read. IfSuppress (or one of the other buttons read) has read it means the read hastransferred from the question to the button, so take up the question as in 8 aboveto F/N. If there is no read on the buttons the question should just F/N) After thequestion is taken to F/N there is no need to then check Suppress. Just go on to thenext question.11. If the pc gets critical realize you have missed a withhold and pull the MWH.12. If an R/S occurs note it large and clear on the worksheets and then circle it in redafter session with the statement or question on which it occurred. Note the fact onthe Auditor Report Form and Program Sheet with session date and W/S page.13. If a reading question does not go to F/N and bogs or the TA goes high, take up anL1 RA (Integ Repair List), assess and handle per instructions.14. EXAMINER. All Integrity Processing sessions must be followed immediately bya standard Pc Examination.15. On any Bad Exam Report (non-F/N, BIs or non-optimum statement) after anInteg session, or on any pc who gets sick or upset or does not do well or has ahigh or low TA, give an L1 RA as the next action.The 24 Hour Red Tag Rule must be strictly enforced.In the case of a pc requiring an L1 RA the Case Supervisor would also look forevidence of questions F/Ned on something else, unflat questions, or withholdsgotten off more than once.A poor or comm lag TR 2, hidden from the view of the C/S, can also mess up apc on Integ as it invalidates his answers and makes him feel he hasn’t gotten itoff. If suspected this could be checked by D of P Interview or pc to Exams:“What did the auditor do?”16. The Integrity Form is complete when all questions on the Form have beenhandled as above and all reading questions taken to an F/N on that question.SUMMARYIf this procedure is followed and the Integrity Processing done with good TRsand metering the pc will get great results and regain abilities.Originally reissued as BTBby Flag Mission 1234Revised & Reissued by CS—4Approved byCommodore’s Staff Aidesand the Board of Issuesfor theBOARDS OF DIRECTORSof theCHURCHES OF SCIENTOLOGYBDCS:RS:AL:MG:clb.rdCopyright © 1972,1974, 1975by L.

It is useful inIntegrity Processing.)ARC BREAKSThe commonest cause of failure in running overt acts is “cleaning cleans” whetheror not one is using a meter. The pc who really has more to tell doesn’t ARC Breakwhen the Auditor continues to ask for one but may snarl and eventually give it up.On the other hand leaving an overt touched on the case and calling it clean willcause a future ARC Break with the Auditor.“Have you told all?” prevents cleaning a clean. On the unmetered pc one can seethe pc brighten up. On the meter you get a nice fall if it’s true that all is told.“Have I not found out about something?” prevents leaving an overt undisclosed.On the unmetered pc the reaction is a sly flinch. On a metered pc it gives a read.A pc’s protest against a question will also be visible in an unmetered pc in areeling sort of exasperation which eventually becomes a howl of pure bafflement atwhy the Auditor won’t accept the answer that that’s all. On a meter, protest of aquestion falls on being asked for: “Is this question being protested?”There is no real excuse for ARC Breaking a pc by:1. Demanding more than is there or2. Leaving an overt undisclosed that will later make the pc upset with theAuditor.WHY OVERTS WORKOverts give the highest gain in raising cause level because they are the biggestreason why a person restrains himself and withholds self from action.Man is basically good. But the reactive mind tends to force him into evil actions.These evil actions are instinctively regretted and the individual tries to refrain fromdoing anything at all. The “best” remedy, the individual thinks, is to withhold. “If Icommit evil actions, then my best guarantee for not committing is to do nothingwhatever.” Thus we have the “lazy”, inactive person.268"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Others who try to make an individual guilty for committing evil actions onlyincrease this tendency to laziness.Punishment is supposed to bring about inaction. And it does. In some unexpectedways.However, there is also an inversion (a turnabout) where the individual sinksbelow recognition of any action. The individual in such a state cannot conceive of anyaction and therefore cannot withhold action. And thus we have the criminal who can’tact really but can only re-act and is without any self direction. This is why punishmentdoes not cure criminality but in actual fact creates it; the individual is driven belowwithholding or any recognition of any action. A thief’s hands stole the jewel, the thiefwas merely an innocent spectator to the action of his own hands. Criminals are verysick people physically.So there is a level below withholding that an Auditor should be alert to in somepcs, for these “have no withholds” and “have done nothing”. All of which, seenthrough their eyes, is true. They are merely saying “I cannot restrain myself” and “Ihave not willed myself to do what I have done”.The road out for such a case is the same as that for any other case. It is justlonger. The processes for levels above hold also for such cases. But don’t be anxiousto see a sudden return of responsibility, for the first owned “done” that this personknows he or she has done may be “ate breakfast”. Don’t disdain such answers in LevelII particularly. Rather, in such people, seek such answers.There is another type of case in all this, just one more to end the list. This is thecase who never runs O/W but “seeks the explanation of what I did that made it allhappen to me”.This person easily goes into past lives for answers. Their reaction to a questionabout what they’ve done is to try to find out what they did that earned all thosemotivators. That, of course, isn’t running the process and the Auditor should be alertfor it and stop it when it happens.This type of case goes into its extreme on guilt. It dreams up overts to explainwhy. After most big murders the police routinely have a dozen or two people comearound and confess. You see, if they had done the murder, this would explain whythey feel guilty. As a terror stomach is pretty awful grim to live with, one is apt to seekany explanation for it if it will only explain it.On such cases the same approach as given works, but one should be very carefulnot to let the pc get off overts the pc didn’t commit.Such a pc (recognizable by the ease they dive into the extreme past) when beingaudited off a meter gets more and more frantic and wilder and wilder in overts reported.They should get calmer under processing of course, but the false overts make themfrantic and hectic in a session. On a meter one simply checks for “Have you told meanything beyond what really has occurred?” Or “Have you told me any untruths?”The observation and meter guides given in this section are used during a sessionwhen they apply but not systematically such as after every pc answer. Theseobservations and meter guides are used always at the end of every session on the pcs towhom they apply.LRH:nt.rdL. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1964, 1974Founderby L.

And the next most fundamental element to know is that: ACASE WITH WITHHOLDS WILL NOT CLEAR. Perhaps, if this is repeated loudenough and long enough, not only Preclears, but perhaps even Auditors will realize thatthis is an absolute, unavoidable truth, one which can not be overlooked or neglected atany time, under any circumstances.First of all, what is a withhold? A withhold is a no action after the fact of action inwhich the individual has done or been an accessory to doing something which is atransgression against some moral code consisting of agreements to which the individualhas subscribed in order to guarantee, with others, the survival of a group with which heis co-acting or has co-acted toward survival.Because a withhold is a no action or a no motion after doingness, it naturallyhangs up in time and floats in time due to the actions or the overts which preceded theno action or no motion of the withhold. The reactive mind is, therefore, the combinedwithholds stocked up which the individual has against groups from which he feels thathe is individuated but from which he has not separated due to the fact that he has thesewithholds in his bank and also all the combined agreements toward survival of all thesegroups, from which he is not separate, and which he uses reactively to solve problemsnow without inspection.Example: The individual belonged at some time to the Holy Fighters. One of themores of this group was that all should be destroyed who do not accept the Word. TheHoly Fighters went out on a punitive expedition against a neighboring tribe who wouldnot accept the Word, but accepted some other belief. There was a great battle with muchkilling; however, during the battle, the individual took pity upon a helpless child anddid not kill him, but took the child off the field of battle, gave him food and drink, andleft him, returning, himself, to the battle.After the battle was successfully won, the Holy Fighters had their usual serviceduring which all spoke of how they had killed all non-believers. Our individualwithheld from the group that he had not only failed to kill, but had saved the life of anon-believer. Thus we have the no action of the withhold after the overt or action ofsaving the child, all of which added up to a transgression against the mores of the HolyFighters.Because of such similar transgressions, the individual finally individuated fromthe group of Holy Fighters and became a member of the Board of Directors of theSociety for Kindness to Humans, which itself had its own agreements to survival andwith which the individual agreed; however, when difficulties or problems arose, theindividual instead of treating all with kindness tended to covertly try to destroy all whowould not accept the tenets of kindness. So he reactively was solving the problems ofthe Society of Kindness with a survival mores of the Holy Fighters. Due to all histransgressions and withholds of his destructive impulses while a member of the Societyfor Kindness, he finally individuated from this group.270"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Now he is a member of Anti-Emotions, Incorporated, but he finds that he can’trule out all his emotions, but tends to be destructive and kind at the same time. So he isstill solving problems not only with the mores of the Holy Fighters, but with those ofthe Society for Kindness to Humans. And so it goes.Processing this individual we will find that he has all these withholds of overtsagainst the Holy Fighters, the Society for Kindness to Humans, and Anti-Emotions,Incorporated. After we have pulled all these overts, he will truly be separate from thesegroups and no longer reactively use their survival mechanisms as solutions toproblems.Further the action of withholding is one point where the Preclear does what thereactive mind does. He withholds his own overts of transgressions against the moralcode of a group in order to avoid punishment, thusly enhance his own survival, and hewithholds himself from the group finally in an effort to avoid committing furtheroverts. So just as the reactive mind contains all past survival agreements which are usedto solve problems threatening the survival of the individual, so does the individualdecide to withhold transgressions, in order to survive himself, and withholds himselffrom groups to avoid committing overts.Withholding and surviving occur at the same time. So the communication bridgebetween the Preclear and the reactive mind is the withhold.The pulling of overts which have been withheld then is the first step towardsgetting the Preclear to take control of the reactive mind. The more withholds he givesup, the more the old survival mechanisms of the reactive mind are destroyed.Further as a withhold of an overt creates a further overt act of not-know on thegroup with which one is co-acting toward survival along an agreed upon moral code,so we are running off all the ignorance created for others by an individual which resultsin ignorance to himself. In this fashion, we are processing the individual up towardNative State or Knowingness.Therefore, in doing Integrity Processing on a Preclear, you are really attacking thewhole basis of the reactive mind. It is an activity which the Auditor should earnestlyand effectively engage upon. In doing this the Auditor always assumes that the Preclearcan remember his overts and can overwhelm the reactive mind. Just as with the CCHsso with Processing Checks, any objections raised by the Preclear as regards IntegrityProcessing are only a confusion being thrown up by the reactive mind, but theindividual is really trying to look for what is there despite the reactive mind’s doingthis. This is why any failure to pull an overt is considered a crime against the Preclear.The Auditor in failing to pull an overt has given the reactive mind a win and the Precleara failure, and has further given the Preclear another overt against the group he is nowassociated with, namely, that of Scientology, because he has succeeded in withholdingfrom it.So in Integrity Processing the Auditor must get the Preclear to answer thequestion without developing meter-dependency. This creates confidence that theAuditor and the Preclear are really working together to overwhelm the reactive mind.If the meter gives an instant read to the question then the Auditor uses the E-Meterto assist the Preclear in pulling all further overts and takes it earlier similar to get an F/NON THE QUESTION BEING ASKED.A stable datum as regards this is that if the question reacts, there are withholdsthere or not all about a particular withhold was pulled. Never allow a Preclear topersuade you that it is only already pulled withholds which are still reacting. Awithhold pulled will not cause a question to still react; it can only be that not all aboutthe withhold was pulled or that there are further undisclosed withholds on thatquestion, or it is a false read (withhold of nothing) in which case the question will F/Non false.271"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"DO NOT LEAVE AN INTEGRITY PROCESSING QUESTION UNTIL THEAUDITOR, THE PRECLEAR, THE REACTIVE MIND, AND THE E-METER AREIN ABSOLUTE AGREEMENT THAT THERE IS NOTHING MORE ON APARTICULAR QUESTION. THIS WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY THE EP OF F/NCOG VGIs ON THE QUESTION.Remember the E-Meter is not bound by the Auditor’s Code. If it reacts on aquestion, then the Auditor must take that question to full EP with an F/N. A question,having once read, is NOT nulled to a no-read. It is audited to an F/N. Obtaining a readand taking the read to F/N depends on good Auditor presence and excellence of TRs,Basic Auditing and Metering.A Processing Check question must never be left without F/Ning. If the Preclear’sintensive is terminating, you must complete that question no matter how many extrahours you have to put in on the Preclear. Do not end session without carrying thequestion you are working on to EP. Any failure to pull an overt is a crime against thatPreclear.Eliminate all “unkind thought” questions in Integrity Processing. Use “doneanything to” type questions. Unkind thoughts are merely tags telling you that thePreclear has actually done something. Unkind thoughts are merely a mechanism oflessening the overt.In pulling overts, be careful that you do not allow the Preclear to give you hisjustifications for having committed it. In allowing him to give you motivators or“reasons why” you are allowing him to lessen the overt.You are only interested in what the Preclear has done, not what he has heard thatothers have done. So never allow a Preclear to get off withholds to you about others,except in the case where he has been an accessory to a criminal act.“Other people’s overts” are handled by asking the Preclear, “Have you ever doneanything like that yourself?”Remember that your duty as an Auditor is to simply employ your skill to obtain agreater decency, ability and integrity on the part of others. You do this by performingwell your function of clearing the meter and getting off all overts and withholds. AnAuditor is not an enforcer of public morals. If an Auditor tries to make a Preclearguilty, he is violating Clause 15 of the Auditor’s Code, which says: “Never mix theprocesses of Scientology with those of various other practices”. Punishment is an oldpractice which is not part of our activities in Scientology. Audit against the reality of thePreclear and his moral code and do not try to make him guilty. The value of anywithhold is only the value the Preclear puts on it.As a case improves, his responsibility level will increase, and if his responsibilitylevel is increasing he will get off further, new withholds. If an Auditor is not gettingnew withholds coming off a Preclear, he had better look for a gross error in hisauditing. He either is disinterested and unwilling to help the Preclear, or he istechnically unskillful on his TRs, Basic Auditing and the E-Meter, or he does not havethe Preclear in session or he has withholds himself. Only an Auditor with withholdswill fail to pull them on others.The number of withholds a Preclear has available at any given time depends uponthose that are available at that given time. To clarify this point, assume that all Preclearshave the same set number of withholds. Well, the number available within the realm ofthe Preclear’s present state of reality and responsibility will naturally vary. Preclearswith a high reality and responsibility level will have more withholds available forpulling than Preclears with a low reality and responsibility level. This is why it is soimportant that Processing Checks be continued throughout auditing. His reality andresponsibility level will increase throughout processing bringing to light many new272"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"overts. If these are not pulled, the Preclear will be forced into unintentionallywithholding them and his case will bog down and not progress.There are prepared Integrity Processing Forms to assist you in pulling withholds.In using these, an Auditor must never, never omit a question on any of these, but hecan add questions to them. Then there are specialized Integrity Processing Formstailored to fit the professional or present activities of the Preclear, and special forms tocover the transgressions of the Preclear against the moral code of any group with whichhe has co-acted. On the latter, as a person in one lifetime only has belonged to manydifferent groups, you can see the tremendous possibility of Integrity Processing appliedto the moral code of all groups on a whole track basis. Particular attention must be paidto the present group with whom he is currently co-acting, namely Scientology. This iswhy it is important to do the last two pages* of the Basic Integrity Processing Formand others specifically related to the subject of Scientology as applicable on allScientologists first, because in the first place he is expecting something to help himagainst which he has overts and to that degree these overts are overts against himself asthey will, if not pulled, prevent him from being helped, and in the second place overtsagainst current groups are most important, then overts committed in this lifetime, andthen overts committed on the track, the reason being that he is still connected with thesecurrent groups and with this lifetime.Integrity Processing is a most fruitful source of cognition, because you arepulling off the Preclear’s not-knows on the Third Dynamic, which have kept others inignorance and himself in stupidity. Besides this, you tremendously increase thePreclear’s ability to communicate. And on top of all this you make a Preclear mucheasier to audit. And if all his withholds are pulled, he can be cleared.Pretty good gains to work for?Well then, let’s get busy.Compiled from LRH briefingsand materials byLt. Comdr.

RON HUBBARD.)HCO is primarily interested in JUSTICE.The method of justice practiced in the 17th and 18th Centuries was to catch theoffenders and hang them, thus keeping the countryside “quiet”.Although useful as a method of quieting things down, however, it doesn’t dopeople any good to be hung! You will find the remedy expressed in this rule:WHEN YOU GIVE INTEGRITY PROCESSING TO A PERSON WITHOUTFINDING THE EARLIER BASIC, YOU HANG THEM.If you can’t chase back an Integrity Processing question to an F/N you are goingto get continuous Ethics trouble from that person from then on until it is remedied.When you give a guy Integrity Processing and it doesn’t produce anything andthe needle is clean you should indicate that the Integrity Processing was unnecessary.You will probably get an F/N.HCO’s interest in someone is normally in what is going on, what is he up toNOW. So one tends to omit to ask how come this guy has been committing overts forthe past two-and-a-half years—the same ones—and it is still going on? Back in thatearlier zone is one hell of an overt, continuous overts against Scientology or LRH. Sowhat is it? You should trace it back and you could find a dilly!It’s the EARLIEST item available on that chain that will get the F/N. Andremember that overts of Omission are always preceded by overts of Commission. Soyou should ask yourself, “How come all these overts of omission?” There’s an earlierovert of commission, you can be sure.This gives us another rule:IF YOU CANNOT F/N A QUESTION, YOU HAVEN’T GOT IT.Now it could be the buttons are out (invalidate, protest, action unnecessary). Didyou know you can beef up a TA (send it up high) by doing an unnecessary action? Itacts somewhat like forcing a wrong item on a pc. It puts him on a protest, a rejectionand an effort to stop the action. That is where a lot of the unpopularity of earliertechniques stems from.Of the rudiments ARC Break, problem, withhold, Integrity Processing specializesin overts and withholds. So the full panorama of Integrity Processing buttons is Rudsplus False, Suppress, Invalidate, Evaluate, Protest, Unnecessary. So if the TA goes upduring Integrity Processing you should check buttons. If it doesn’t handle rapidly andeasily revert to the L 1RA (Integ Repair List).274"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"IF YOU CAN’T GET AN F/N ON INTEGRITY PROCESSING AND HAVETO END SESSION YOU MUST HAVE A LINE TO QUAL THAT CLEANS IT UPWITHIN 24 HOURS.Every time an Integrity Processing action won’t fly it has got to be a 24-hoururgent repair. The Integrity Processing Repair List consists of the ruds and buttons.People ARC Break with the physical universe, with fellow men, feel wronged insome way and have to take it out on somebody, and so commit the overt. But thesomebody they attack is not the source of the upset. They misidentify the source. Iftheir think was straight they would be able to see what the score was and have nocharge on it.An overt therefore is preceded by an ARC Break, and you will find an ARCBreak is the result of a problem.So each time you don’t take a question to F/N you run up against this. This givesanother way for them to get unpopular. But if it didn’t F/N, you also know it wasnecessary to give the person Integrity Processing!If you give a person Integrity Processing and you see a trail of catastrophes in thatperson’s wake afterwards you know it didn’t fly. Similarly a person who makes hugeoverts out of every little action, which is in essence self-invalidation, has behind thatsomewhere a huge overt—big enough to set the police of several galaxies after them !If it doesn’t F/N you haven’t got it!THE E-METER AND THE CRIMINALThe joker in all this is that the E-Meter reads on Reality. So you can have a guywho reads on none of your questions, but you find out the next day he had doneexactly what you asked him. Yet it didn’t read! A real criminal just doesn’t read onhaving killed his grandmother in cold blood five minutes before the Processing. Even ifhe admits it it doesn’t read! But a real criminal won’t clear and won’t F/N.Occasionally they will R/S.You have to handle it on a gradient of reality. “Why wasn’t that an overt?” is oneway you could try. He would at first be very surprised at the very thought of it being anovert. But you could get a stream of justifications off. Another way is to magnify theovert. You can use that on a “no-overt” case.The Tech of it belongs in the field of auditing.Anytime Integrity Processing is done the session reports must go into the pcfolder otherwise the C/S can make an error in C/Sing because of the omitted data.One does not do Integrity Processing in the middle of other auditing rundowns.The action therefore requires C/S clearance.HCO AND CASE GAIN(See HCO PL 20 July 1970,Cases and Morale of Staff”)The percentage of people who have case gain will be proportional to the level ofmorale in your Org. So it is of interest to HCO to ask the C/S how many no-case-gaincases he has (Pile 4), trace them down and isolate them. The names of those not doingwell (Piles 2 and 3) should also be known and the numbers so you can make sure thegreater percentage is getting good case gain.HCO can get trouble stemming from lack of staff case progress. For instance you findan Exec giving excuses for not doing his job. It can be due to a no-case-gain under himenturbulating seniors and associates. They in turn, not recognizing him as the source of275"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"the enturbulation, buy the stops and the “can’t be dones” and find some other excuse asto why not to do their job. Recognize that when someone dumps his hat on you he hasoverts, man!An Executive instead of reporting that people don’t want to work in his divisionshould be asking, “How come they don’t want to work in the division?”Things will get better to the degree that such cases producing stops and “can’ts”have a line for them to be handled on.Begin a campaign to get all these cases winning.If there is any query as to which of the four categories of case folders (per HCOPL 20 July 70) a person belongs on, it goes on the one lower. For instance a category,Pile 2, queried as to status immediately becomes Pile 3.Pile 4 cases are given Integrity Processing. Such processing is however notlimited to such cases.It is extremely valuable processing to raise the cause level of staff, students andothers.Compiled from LRH briefingsand materials byLt. Comdr.

The person may not immediately react. But the least thatwill happen is that he will be more difficult to audit in the future, and will go out of session moreeasily. More violently, a pc who has had an Integrity Processing question left unflat may leave thesession and do himself or Scientology considerable mischief.About the most unkind thing you could do to a person would be to leave an Integrity Processingquestion unflat and go on to the next one. Or to fail to obtain an F/N on withholds in the rudimentsand go on with the session.One girl, being audited, was left unflat on a withhold question. The Auditor blithely went on tothe next question. The girl went out after session, and told everyone she knew the most vicious lies shecould create about the immoral conduct of Scientologists. She wrote a stack of letters to people sheknew out of town, telling gruesome tales of sexual orgies. An alert Scientologist heard the rumors,rapidly traced them back, got hold of the girl, sat her down and checked auditing and found the unflatwithhold question. The withhold? Sexual misdemeanors. Once that was pulled, the girl hastily racedabout correcting all her previous efforts to discredit.A man had been a stalled case for about a year. He was violent to audit. The special question wasfinally asked, “What withhold question was left unflat on you?” It was found and handled. After that hiscase progressed again.The mechanisms of this are many. The reactions of the pc are many. The summation of it is,when an Integrity Processing question is left unflat on a pc and thereafter ignored, the consequences arenumerous.THE REMEDYThe prevention of Integrity Processing being left unflat is easily accomplished:1. Develop excellent TRs and Basic Auditing.2. Know the E-Meter.3. Work only with an approved E-Meter.4. Know the various bulletins on Integrity Processing.5. Get off your own withholds so that you won’t avoid those in others.6. Apply correct Integrity Processing procedure and handle each reading question to an honest F/N on that question.LRH:nt.rdL.

This is remedied by taking each reading question to an F/N on the question.The best way to “miss” an Integrity Processing question is to let the pc indulge ingeneralities or “I thought ....”A withhold given as “Oh, I got mad at them lots of times,” should be pulled downto when and where and the first time “you got mad” and finally, “What did you do tothem just before that?” Then earlier similar if no F/N.The pc who withholds somebody else’s withholds and gives them as answers is acard. But he isn’t helped when the auditor lets him do it.Situation: You ask the pc for a withhold about Joe. The pc who says, “I heardthat Joe . . . ,” should be asked right there, “What have you done to Joe? You. Justyou.” And it turns out he stole Joe’s last blonde. But if the auditor had let this pc go onand on about how the pc had heard how Joe was this or that, the session would havegone on and on and the Tone Arm up and up.We have pcs who use “withholds” to spread all manner of lies. We ask this pc,“Have you ever done anything to the Org?” The pc says, “Well, I’m withholding that Iheard . . . ,” or the pc says, “Well, I thought some bitter thoughts about the Org.” Orthe pc says, “I was critical of the Org when . . . ,” and we don’t sail in and get WHATTHE PC DID, we can comfortably stretch a 5-minute item to a session or two.If the pc “heard” and the pc “thought” and the pc “said” in answer to an IntegrityProcessing question, the pc’s reactive bank is really saying, “I’ve got a crashing bigwithhold and if I can keep on fooling around by giving critical thoughts, rumours, andwhat others did, you’ll never get it.” And if he gets away with it, the auditor has misseda withhold question.We only want to know what the pc did, when he did it, what was the first time hedid it and what he did just before that, and we’ll nail it every time.THE IRRESPONSIBLE PCIf you want to get withholds off an “irresponsible pc” you sometimes can’t askwhat the pc did or withheld and get a meter reaction.This problem has bugged us for some time; I finally got very bright and realizedthat no matter whether the pc thought it was a crime or not, he or she will answer up on“don’t know” versions as follows:Situation: “What have you done to your husband?” Pc’s answer, “Nothing bad.”E-Meter reaction, nul. Now we know this pc, through our noticing she is critical of herhusband, has overts on him. But she can take no responsibility for her own acts.279"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"But she can take responsibility for his not knowing. She is making certain ofthat.So we ask, “What have you done that your husband doesn’t know about?”And it takes an hour for her to spill it all, the quantity is so great. For the questionreleases the floodgates. The Meter bangs around.And with these withholds off, her responsibility comes up and she can takeresponsibility on the items.This applies to any zone or area or terminal of Integrity Processing.Situation: We are getting a lot of “I thought”, “I heard”, “They said”, “They did”in answer to a question. We take the terminal or terminals involved and put them in thisblank:“What have you done that ______(doesn’t) (don’t) know about?”And we can get the major overts that lay under the blanket of “How bad everyoneis but me.”This prevents you missing an Integrity Processing question. It’s a bad crime to doso. This will shorten the labour involved in getting every question flat.And if your pc is withholdy you can insert this “Have I missed an IntegrityProcessing question on you?” while doing the processing.Always clear up what was missed.A pc can be very upset by reason of a missed Integrity Processing question. Keepthem going up, not down.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH: nt.rdCopyright © 1972, 1973, 1974by L.

The auditor asks the question, the needle instantly reacts, thepc (as he or she usually does) looks puzzled if the auditor says “It reacts.” The pcthinks it over. As he or she is thinking, the auditor will see the same reaction on theneedle. Softly the auditor says “That” or “There” or “What’s that you’re looking at?”As the pc knows what he or she is looking at at that instant, the thing can be dug up.This is auditor co-operation, not triumph.Most often the pc does not know what it is that reacts as only unknowns react.Therefore an auditor’s “There” when the needle twitches again, before the pc hasanswered, co-ordinates with whatever the pc is looking at and thus it can be spotted andrevealed by the pc. This is only done when the pc comm lags for a few seconds.Remember, the pc is always willing to reveal. He or she doesn’t know What toreveal. Therein lies the difficulty. Pcs get driven out of session when asked to revealsomething yet do not know what to reveal.By the auditor’s saying “There” or “What’s that?” quietly each time the needlereacts newly, the pc is led to discover what should be revealed.Auditors and pcs get into a games condition in Integrity Processing and rudimentsonly when the auditor refuses this help to the pc.New auditors routinely believe that in Integrity Processing the pc knows theanswer and won’t give it. This is an error. If the pc knew all the answer, it wouldn’treact on the meter.Old-timers have found out that only if they steer by repeated meter reaction,giving the pc “There” or “What’s that?” can the pc answer up on most rudimentsquestions, missed withholds and so on.But don’t use steering to harass the pc, or cut his comm, or draw attention to theauditor.This is the only use of reads other than instant reads on the E-Meter.Help the pc.

Auditors must not be kind nor yet unkind. Thisdoes not mean that you steer a lukewarm middle course between kindness andunkindness. Neither of these two impostors have anything to do with it. You just go inand audit, you go in to find—and that means dig for—OVERTS. If you go in with Pc’sneedle clean and your questioning can get that needle to react, then you are winning.The success of an Auditor can be measured by the extent to which he can getreactions on the needle and then cleaning those reactions getting more reactions andcleaning those and so on. The skilled Auditor gets to the root of the trouble and clearsup a whole batch of overts at once by handling chains of overts to F/N.Integrity Processing is done in Model Session. The beginning rudiments are putin and by the time you start the body of the session, in this case the IntegrityProcessing, the Pc should have an F/N. The next thing is to tell the Pc that you aregoing to help him to clean up, and really clean up, the questions on the Form that youare using. REMEMBER IT IS THE QUESTION YOU ARE GOING TO CLEAN—NOT THE NEEDLE. You’ve already got a clean needle and you could probably keep itfrom reading on questions by bad TR 1, failure to dig, or just sheer bad auditing.The next action is to announce the first question that you are going to handle, atthe same time watching the meter for any read on first calling. It can be important togroove in the question. There are a variety of ways to do this, e.g. ask what thequestion means. What period or time the question covers. What activities would beincluded. Where the Pc has been that might be something to do with the question. Ifany other people are likely to be involved. In other words, you are steering the Pc’sattention to various parts of his bank and getting him to have a preliminary look. Whenthis has been done using very good TR 1, you give him the question again. A small tickmay now have developed into a real LF or BD. You take your Pc’s answer and get thespecifics. If he gives you a general answer you ask him for a specific time (or a specificexample). DON’T ACCEPT MOTIVATORS. If he gives you a motivator you say,“OK, but what did you do there?” and you want something before the motivator.Example: Pc: “I got mad at him because he kicked my foot.” Aud: “What had you donebefore he kicked your foot?” In this case the Pc is giving an overt, “I got mad at him,”but in fact he is cunningly selling the motivator “He kicked me in the foot.” So the rulehere is, “Go earlier than the motivator.” Similarly you don’t accept criticisms, unkindthoughts, explanations. You want what the Pc has done and you want the Time, Place,Form and Event.When you have succeeded in this you don’t leave it there. You ask for an earliertime he had done something like it and you keep going earlier. What you are after is theearliest time he stole, hit somebody, got angry with a Pc or whatever is his “crime”.Get the earliest one and you will find that the others will blow off like thistledown.Keep a sly eye on your meter and you can tell when you are in a hot area. Use itto help you to know where to dig, but don’t use it to steer the Pc at this stage. This285"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"encourages laziness on the part of the Pc. You want him in there foraging about anddigging up his bank in the process.Having once gotten a read on the question, the question is not further checked onthe meter. One simply follows the chain back earlier similar (same chain). Use standardIntegrity Processing procedure until an F/N is obtained with cognition and VGIs.If you do this properly you will have a well satisfied Pc. If he ARC breaks thenyou have missed something, so pull your missed withholds. A rising TA is a clue tosomething missed or a bypassed F/N. If Pc isn’t happy—very happy—at the end of aquestion then you have missed something. Pcs will tell you a hundred and one thingsthat are wrong with your auditing, the D of P’s instruction, the form of the question,etc., but they all add up to the same thing—something has been missed.One word of warning. If you leave a question unflat, mark it on your Auditor’sReport and TELL YOUR PC it isn’t flat.

Use the question as a guide for digging, not as a rote question.2. Follow each non-reading question with suppress and leave each reading questiononly when it has been taken to EP (per HCO B 13 Dec 72R, Integrity ProcessingSeries 10R, “Integrity Processing Questions Must Be F/Ned”). If suppression isfound, start the cycle over with the question itself after suppress is clean. Realizethat withholds exist, that they can be suppressed and that they can be restimulatedand pulled. Once you have EP, however, don’t recheck the question.3. Suppress is always asked “repetitively” and not as a “fast check”.4. An R/S means CRIMES that MUST be pulled. A sporadic R/S can be turned onfull by varying the question that produced it; the R/S will become wider and morechronic as the exact crime is approached. When the crime is found the R/S willbecome very pronounced, and then vanish. That’s CRIMES, not “failed to washthe car”.5. A DR (Dirty Read) is not an R/S but can sometimes turn into an R/S by probing ifa crime is present. It is noted on the worksheet as a “DR” though, never as anR/S.6. The specific details of each misdeed must be gotten. Don’t buy generalizedoverts, motivators and justifications.7. You still use a comm cycle. Avoid heavy accusation.8. ARC Breaks must be clean—you can’t audit over an ARC Break.9. Check for missed withholds every few questions.10. Clean up the Integrity Processing Form at the end with such questions as ‘‘l/2truth” and “Have you gotten away with anything?” etc.11. Follow questions with “Have you told me more than was there?” on a Pc whotends to dub in overts or motivators.12. Limit the Pc to this life if he takes up running track in an effort to avoid this lifeoffenses.13. Clean up any DN as soon as it appears by checking for a missed withhold orgetting all? of the one you’re on.14. Watch the Pc’s indicators, e.g. for signs of missed withholds.287"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"15. Keep track of the TA position during Integrity Processing. If a question sends theTA higher and if it then remains higher, something was missed on that question.16. Pursue each chain to basic.17. Pat “No’s” can be handled by asking for overwhelmingly large overts, e.g.“Have you robbed any banks?” (Murder technique) or by reverse questions suchas “Tell me about when you have not stolen something.”18. A question that reads sporadically isn’t quite the right one and needs to be varied.19. Keep aware of the needle—especially when a question is first called. Also,questions sometimes will show a need to be compartmented, e.g. “Have you everstolen (read) anything?” Here the read on “stolen” should be pursued. A Pc with aknown withhold can have a prior read and not an instant one—this is somethingto watch for.20. Keep your TR 1 in. Otherwise questions will not read due to lack of Auditorimpingement.21. Keep your TR 2 in. Otherwise the Pc will feel his answer has not been acceptedand it can put a Pc on a withhold of nothing.22. Help the Pc give a withhold he’s having trouble presenting. One way is by havinghim tell you what subject it’s about or “part of it”, another is by use of theoverwhelmingly large overt approach: “Well, did you murder someone?”23. Cut any natter line, pin down the critical thoughts and motivators and get the priorovert. The person getting Integrity Processing must not be allowed to sit andnatter about a person or an Org, etc.24. A person who has a valid EP on an Integrity Processing Form has the whole formended off. It’s the subject of the Integrity List which EPs, not just one question.25. Beware of a “false read”, which is thinking something read which didn’t. Protestcan then give you a read. Clean up questions with “Protest”, “Suppress”, “Inval”buttons where the Pc says there’s nothing there. Then if it still reads on check,there is something there. False reads (saying something read which really didn’t)can wreck a case. Can also check for demanding a withhold he doesn’t have.26. Make sure you get the question answered—question: “Did you steal the toolsfrom the tool shed?” is not answered by “I have a thing about keys.”  Reissued as BTB by  Flag Mission 1234  Revised by  W/O Ron Shafran  CS-4Approved byCommodore’s Staff AidesBoard of Issuesfor theBOARDS OF DIRECTORSof theCHURCHES OF SCIENTOLOGYBDCS:RS:MH:AL:nt.rdCopyright © 1968,1974, 1975by L.

When required it may be entered into a pgm at asuitable rest point but any current process or rundown in progress on the Pc would becompleted first. The C/S should not use this to unduly delay Integrity Processing whenrequired, as a person withholding overts will not make gains until those overts havebeen pulled.The Auditor must be qualified as a Hubbard Integrity Processing Specialist. Thisis a new tech. Its practitioners must be specialist trained.Standard C/Sing rules apply. In addition the C/S looks for the following keypoints.1. Any non-sequitur F/N on some other subject. Ensures that each question isF/Ned on the subject being asked about. This is the primary thing the C/Sinspects.2. Check that each reading question was taken to an F/N.3. Check that any R/Ses were recorded clearly and noted at the front of Pcfolder for future use.4. Ensure that an Integrity Processing Repair List (L1RA) is used if sessionends with no F/N or Pc at all upset or gets sick shortly after IntegrityProcessing. Examiner 24 Hour Rule must be rigorously applied.No. 1 above is of prime importance. Don’t permit Auditors to go into someunusual solution such as checking the question after it has been taken to F/N. Thatcould wreck a case. The Auditor simply audits, keeps the Pc on the right chain goingearlier as necessary to an F/N. It is the C/S who checks to see that it was in fact thequestion being asked that F/Ned. This is done by checking for any non-sequituranswers that F/Ned on some other subject.If a person falls on his head after an Integrity Processing session an L1RA isgiven. However an FES to find missing questions that F/Ned on something else isdone.The whole essence of this is contained in F/Ning every item; getting questionasked to F/N, not some other; Integrity Processing Repair List LIRA; fines for missingwithholds; and Expanded Dianetics for R/Sers (revealing and recording R/Ses andR/Sing statements for later use in Exp Dianetics).

That is the basic center line of Integrity Processing, transgressionsagainst the mores of the group.You can have a special mores between the individual and different groups,between the son and the mother, between the husband and the wife, between the staffmember and the organization, or between the Auditor and the Preclear (to which theAuditor Integrity Processing Form is directed).It’s a moral code that you are processing one way or the other. You’restraightening out somebody on the “now I’m supposed to’s” against which they havetransgressed. And having so transgressed they now are individuated. If theirindividuation is too obsessive they snap in and become the terminal and can assume thecharacteristics of that person.In dealing with this you go straight to the person’s handling of masses andchanges of spaces or into his most confused motional areas (not e-motional).A person has been a recluse and stayed inside a house ever since he was 20. Youdon’t start running houses in his Integrity Processing. You find what area he was inbefore he was 20. Staying in the house is a solution to something. We find an area ofconsiderable activity that lies prior to the difficulty and then run Integrity Processing onthat area.We find there was one boarding school he absolutely detests. That’s what wehandle. Every question would have to do with that boarding school. There are studentsand boys and instructors and coaches and headmasters and buildings and athleticequipment, etc. Write them all down (you don’t ask the Pc) then work out all the typesof crimes he might have been able to commit against those items. In this way youcompile a whole Integrity Processing Form to suit the situation.Most often one takes the most appropriate issued form and simply adds a fewquestions to cover the special situation. You can always add some questions but don’tomit any. When you want to handle a specific area or activity it can be more satisfactoryto compile a special form covering all the things you think of that he could have done inthat area that he is never going to tell anybody.291"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"This is particularly so when the area has its own special tight mores he has cut upagainst and so has individuated himself from that area, cannot as-is any part of the trackand of course gets trapped in that particular zone and activity.Forget is a version of Not Know. So any sensory perceptic shut-off is an effortnot to know and you have a target.So you can do little special Integrity Processing Forms to go along with a specialzone of activity and eventually you’ll get a “What do you know!” There is no use tellinghim what he has been doing wrong. He is too in the thing to see it. You can see itbecause you’re outside it.You just put “Have you ever done anything to_____” to a whole list and you’vegot a formulized method of getting together an Integrity Processing Form.A cognition is totally dependent upon a freedom to know. Overts and withholdsare dedicated to Not Knowingness. It takes the guidance of the Integrity ProcessingForm list of questions to handle this.The formula then is to just make a list of all the items you can think of that haveanything to do with the target and write up a list of possible overts against them orquestions that call for overts. Has he done anything to_____Has he interfered withanything about_____etc. Don’t include questions that call for motivators orjustifications.The first rule is—any area or zone of life with which a person is having difficultyin life, or has had difficulty, is a fruitful area for Integrity Processing. You’ll find outevery time he’s got withholds in that zone or area.The second rule is to break the problem down to its most fundamental expression.Then write down those nouns associated with it and those basic doingnesses associatedwith this fundamental expression. Then just phrase up your processing questions onthe basis of “Have you ever_____” and any other verb you want to put in. “Have youever done_____” “_____prevented “ etc. You don’t have to get too fancy as the needlewill fall when you get close to it.That area where an individual is having difficulty he is stupid. Stupidity is NotKnowingness. Not Knowingness occurs through overts. But the overt has to be hiddenso it must be an overt which is withheld. These withholds then add up to stupidity, soof course he has trouble. There isn’t anything complicated about it at all.Compiled from LRH briefingsand materials byLt. Comdr.

A11 subjects haveas their basis a point of first assumption. In Man’s technology this is usually weak and non-factualwhich makes his technology very frail and limited. To reform a subject one has to find this primaryassumption and improve it. This reforming of technical subjects is of great interest to us because oursubject Scientology is advanced even beyond the space travel technologies of very high civilizations.Yet it is flanked on all sides by Man’s corny antique technology in the field of physics, chemistry,”mathematics” and so on. This tends to hold us back somewhat. We strained his tech forward to get theE-Meter, the one thing we had to have.In Navigation, Man bases the whole subject on the assumption that one can’t confront where hecame from or is going or where he is. It assumes he is lost.This is a basis assumption of non-confront. He can’t directly see where he has been or where heis going at sea—it is so large—so he takes off from a point of no-confront in all his reasoning in thesubject.Therefore he goes into a series of symbols and begins to substitute symbols for symbols. Thiswinds him up in a mass of complexity. One spends 90% of his time in studying this subject trying tofind out what symbols the symbols are meant to represent. He says in his texts “G.H.A.” On search wefind this means “Greenwich Hour Angle”. On further search we find this means what angle someheavenly body forms when related to Greenwich as Zero. On further search we find the idiocy that thenavigator’s clock tells angles in HOURS when all he needs is a clock face giving 360 degrees. This isof course complete nonsense. Why hours, and two sets of 12 at that (midnight to Noon and Noon tomidnight) when what he is trying to find out is how many degrees of time have passed. He refers histime to the Sun which, because of the rotations of Earth every 24 hours, appears at an increasingnumber of degrees from Greenwich England as the day advances.Because he starts from a no-confront of ship or plane position he then carries no-confrontthrough the whole subject. If a man isn’t lost as he begins to “navigate” he very often is when hefinishes!Actually no ship or plane is ever lost as to position. One knows he is on Earth and in whatocean and on what side of what ocean and the subject really should be one which merely lets oneCORRECT his position a bit.309"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"Man in this subject of navigation even scorns direct observation (confront) and calls it “jackassnavigation!”In actual fact real navigation is the science of recognition of positions and objects and estimationof relative distances and angles between them.The subject is made complex because it has become, in Man’s hands, the substitution ofsymbols for symbols all based on the assumption that he can’t confront his departure, his current spotor his point of arrival.Out of this, with further study in other fields, I found that any complexity stemmed from aninitial point of non-confront.This is why looking at or recognizing the source of an aberration in processing “blows” it,makes it vanish.Mental mass accumulates in a vast complexity solely because one would not confrontsomething. To take apart a problem requires only to establish what one could not or would notconfront.The basic thing Man can’t or won’t confront is evil.These people who always rationalize evil behavior—”He wasn’t feeling well which is why hemurdered the policeman,” etc.—can be counted on to voice some theetieweetie (goodie-goodie)justification for somebody’s thoroughly evil conduct. Mr. X wrecks a house and you remark on it andMiss Theetie Weetie will feel compelled to say, “Oh, Mr. X had a poor childhood and he didn’t meanany wrong ....” She can’t confront the simple but evil fact that Mr. X is a complete dog. One feels hishair stand on end when Miss Theetie Weetie does this because one is observing a complete non-confront on the part of Miss Theetie Weetie. She is too unreal to do other than make one feel he hashad an ARC Break.One will also find that Miss Theetie Weetie leads a horribly complex life—adjusting herthinking to agree with “air spirits” and leaving her family because there might be mice in thebasement.When no-confront enters, a chain may be set up which leads to total complexity and totalunreality.This, in a very complex form, we call an “aberrated condition”.People like that can’t solve even rudimentary problems and act in an aimless and confused way.To resolve their troubles requires more than education or discipline. It requires processing.Some people are so “complex” that their full aberration does fully not resolve until they attain ahigh level of OT.A large number of people de-aberrate just by the education contained in Scientology as they findin our subject the natural laws of life and seeing (confronting) them, “blow” huge holes in theircomplexities and aberrations.Therefore the above laws are very important ones as they explain what aberration really is andwhy processing really works.Aberration is a chain of vias based on a primary non-confront.Processing is a series of methods arranged on an increasingly deep scale of bringing the preclearto confront the no-confront sources of his aberrations and leading him to a simple, powerful, effectivebeing.

Theitems are selected to add up to the required knowledge of the subject. They are arrangedin the sequence necessary to a gradient of increasing knowledge of the subject. Aftereach item there is a place for the initial of the student or the person checking the studentout. When the checksheet is fully initialed it is complete, meaning the student may nowtake an exam and be granted the award for completion. Some checksheets are requiredto be gone through twice before completion is granted.CHECKLIST: A list of actions or inspections to ready an activity or machinery orobject for use or estimate the needful repairs or corrections. This is erroneouslysometimes called a “checksheet”, but that word is reserved for study steps.CHECKOUT: The action of verifying a student’s knowledge of an item given ona checksheet.TWIN CHECKOUT: When two students are paired they check each other out.This is different than a Supervisor checkout.SUPERVISOR CHECKOUT: A checkout done by the Supervisor of a course orhis assistants.THEORY: The data part of a course where the data as in books, tapes andmanuals is given.PRACTICAL: The drills which permit the student to associate and coordinatetheory with the actual items and objects to which the theory applies. Practical isapplication of what one knows to what one is being taught to understand, handle orcontrol.TWIN: The study partner with whom one is paired. Two students studying thesame subject who are paired to check out or help each other are said to be “Twinned”.TWO-WAY COMM: The precise technology of a process used to clarify data withanother for the other. It is not chatter. It is governed by the rules of auditing. It is usedby Supervisors to clear up blocks to a person’s progress in study, on post, in life or inauditing. It is governed by the communication cycle as discovered in Scientology.METER CHECK: The action of checking the reaction of a student to subjectmatter, words or other things, isolating blocks to study, interpersonal relations or life.It is done with an E-Meter.COURSE SUPERVISOR: The instructor in charge of a course and its students.311"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"COURSE ADMINISTRATOR: The course staff member in charge of the coursematerials and records.TECH SERVICES: The activity which enrolls, routes, schedules, distributes themail of and assists the housing of students.STARRATE CHECKOUT: A very exact checkout which verifies the full andminute knowledge of the student of a portion of study materials and tests his fullunderstanding of the data and ability to apply it.ZERO RATE: Material which is only checked out on the basis of generalunderstanding.BLOW: Unauthorized departure from an area, usually caused by misunderstooddata or overts.LEAVE OF ABSENCE: An authorized period of absence from a course grantedin writing by a Course Supervisor and entered in the student’s study folder.ROLL BOOK: The master record of a course giving the student’s name, local andpermanent address and the date of enrollment and departure or completion.QUAL: The Qualifications Division (Division V of an org) where the student isexamined and where he may receive cramming or special assistance and where he isawarded completions and certificates and where his qualifications as attained on coursesor in auditing are made a permanent record.CRAMMING: A section in the Qualifications Div where a student is given highpressure instruction at his own cost after being found slow in study or when failing hisexams.PROGRAMMING: The overall planning for a person of the courses, auditing andstudy he should follow for the next extended time period.STUDENT CONSULTATION: The personal handling of student problems orprogress by a qualified consultant.HC: A HUBBARD CONSULTANT is skilled in testing, two-way comm,consultation, programming and interpersonal relations.

The one who couldn’t confront was too slow of perception to live long.In a more common line of work, the fast typist could confront study and typing inthe first place and the slow typist couldn’t and can’t.The confusions about “talent” and “native ability” and such are resolved to nosmall extent when one recognizes the role played by the ability to confront.Basically, if one can just be there with it, he can then achieve the skill ofcommunicating with whatever “it” is and handling it.Thus, before communicating with the components of a subject can properlybegin, one must be able to be there comfortably with the components of the subject.All power depends upon the ability to hold a location. To communicate one mustbe able to hold to a location.This is even true in the physical universe. You can’t move a chair unless you canhold a position yourself near the chair. If you don’t believe it, try it.Thus the ability to communicate with precedes the ability to handle. But beforeone can communicate with something one must be able to be in a location near it.The age-old puzzle of how some scholars can get “A” on a subject they havestudied and then not be able to apply even a scrap of the data is resolved by this fact ofconfronting. They can confront the book, the class and the thought. But they haven’tattained the ability to confront the physical objects of the subject.At least such “glib” students can confront the book, the paper, the thought. Theyare partway there.Now all they need to do is confront as well the physical things to which thesubject is applied and they would be able to apply what they know.314"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"Some people are not so lucky as to be “glib” students. They have to work up to“being there” with the book, paper, classroom and teacher.Thus “confronting” is actually the ability to be there comfortably and perceive.Amazing reactions occur when conscious effort is made to do this. Dullness,perception trouble, fogginess, sleep and even pains, emotions and convulsions canoccur when one knowingly sets out to BE THERE AND COMFORTABLYPERCEIVE with the various parts of a subject.These reactions discharge and vanish as one perseveres (continues) and at last,sometimes soon, sometimes after a long while, one can be there and perceive thecomponent.As one is able to confront one part he then finds it easier to confront othercomponents.People have mental tricks they use to get around actual confronting—to bedisinterested, to realize it’s not important, to be sort of half dead, etc—but thesedischarge (run out) as well eventually and at last they can just be there and comfortablyperceive.Eye blinks, swallows, twitches, aches, pains, are all systems of interruptingconfronting and are the symptoms of discomfort. There are many of these. If they arepresent then one is not just being there and perceiving.Confronting on a via (using a relay point) is another method of ducking out of it.The worst off cannot even tolerate the idea of being there and perceivinganything. They run away, even go into emotional fits rather than be there and perceive.Such people’s lives are a system of interruptions and vias, all substitutes forconfronting. They are not very successful. For success in life depends not on runningaway from it but by being there and perceiving it and then being able to communicatewith it and handle it.TERMS“A gradient scale” means a gradual increasing condition of, or a little more of,little by little.A “skipped gradient” means taking on a higher degree or amount before a lesserdegree of it has been handled. One has to go back and handle the missed degree orthing or else one will have just losses on a subject thereafter.“Flattening” something means to do it until it no longer produces a reaction.“Overrunning” something means accumulating protests and upsets about it until itis just a mass of stops. Anyone can do anything forever unless he begins to stop it.“Invalidation” means a refuting or degrading or discrediting or denying somethingsomeone else considers to be a fact.GRADIENTSSome of the things one would have to be able to be there and perceive in order tostudy, placed on a graduated scale of increasing difficulty are:Beginning at all.The classroom or work space.Paper.315"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Books.Writing materials.Sounds.A Student.The Supervisor.The area of the study subject’s physical components.The motionless equipment of the subject.The moving equipment of the subject.Masses connected with the subject.The subject as a whole.The next stages would have to be confronting while moving.

It isintended to set out the various axioms or laws necessary to an understanding of thesubject of confronting itself.From these brief notes all the axioms can be derived.The fundamental and basic simplicities of confronting itself is the first thing thatmust be grasped.

This is strictly a Western pattern. This is how teacher does it inOmaha or Cornell. But never in Shanghai!A Chinese class sings out in unison (all together) in response to the teacher. Theyparticipate!The only Western near equivalent is a German beer hall where the audiencechoruses items sung out by the song leader.Chinese School, then, is an action of class vocal participation. It is a very lively loudaffair. It sounds like chanting.In a real Chinese School the response is so timed that although spoken by manyvoices it is quite easy to tell what answer is being chorused.It is essentially a system that establishes instant thought responses so that the student,given “2x2” thinks instantly “4”.For example, the instructor, tapping a big multiplication chart cries “Two TimesTwo”. The class in one voice cries “Four”. Instructor: “Five times Two”. Class: “Ten”.And so on and on and on by the hour.This gets more complex when, let us say, the maxims of good conduct or the Koranare being taught. In such cases the tablets or scrolls are on the wall. The teacher callsChapter and verse and the students chant it.You could teach the Laws of Listing and Nulling, The Auditor’s Code, Axioms andso on in this way.The tools are the same—an instructor, a pointer, a chart or set of pictures or bigscrolls, a class.There are two steps in such teaching.A. The Instructor taps and says what it is. Then asks the Class what it is and theychant the answer.B. When the Class has learned by being told and repeating, the Instructor now tapswith the pointer and asks and the class chants the correct answer.DRILLThe Instructor himself has to grasp the drill.Here is how it would go on an org bd.318"},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"A.Instructor taps Div 1. “This is Division One HCO Division.”Class chants “Division One HCO Division”.Instructor taps Div 6. “This is Division 6 Distribution Division.”Class: “Division 6 Distribution Division.”And so on until all divisions have been named a few times.B.Instructor taps Div 1. “What is this?”Class: “Division One HCO Division.”Instructor taps Div 4. “What is this?”Class: “Division Four Tech Division.”And so on and on. The divisions are then considered trained in on the Class.Next one would go to Departments. Then to philosophic names of Departments.Then to Sections. Then one would go to the titles of each Division Head. Then to DeptHeads. Etc. Etc.If one had a function org board of what each div and department and post did onewould go on with the same thing.A Chinese School drill run for a short period each day will eventually cover anenormous amount of org bd.Newcomers to the drill have to be schooled in to catch up or join a new class.Anything can be taught by Chinese School that is to be learned by rote. The partsand actions are always the same.There is also a version that uses a text, preferably with a copy of it in each student’shands. It sounds the same.One is limited only by what he can put on a chart or even in a text where eachstudent has a copy of the text open before him.Crude charts are easy to draw up with a felt (heavy ink) pen. The size of a chart isdetermined by the ability of the students furthest away to see it easily.Cloud types, pictures to be named in a foreign language, even slides of airplanetypes, anything can be Chinese Schooled that is to be learned verbatim. And you’d besurprised how many things should be. And if they aren’t the person has a shakyfoundation under the subject.Care should be taken to define strange words. But it is not really a problem orexercise in word clearing. It is verbatim rote teaching.And it works.And is lots of fun.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH: nt.rdCopyright © 1972by L.

He onlylistens to words.In this and in Method 4 word clearing, when being checked he is asked “What isthe definition of (word)?” He is NOT asked “Do you know the meaning of(word)?” To this he could answer “Yes” and believe he did. But when asked forthe definition that he must then give, it is a different story entirely.This is also the right way to handle any defining of words. M2, M4. As well asMethods I & 3.Never let the student be unsure. Make him look it up.You will find that it is the simple word, “as”, “such”, “from”, that really bogsreading, not technical terms.In the Study Tapes there are some photographic terms. Any photo dictionary cangive these. Almost any camera store has such dictionaries.SECOND TIMEThe second time through the Study Tapes the student listens for the sense of thesentences._________It is very revealing to do the Primary Rundown in this fashion.Some students are actually getting meaning out of something heard or read for thefirst time in their lives._________No wonder schoolchildren, by test, get more stupid each additional year ofschool.

It makes a studentSUPER-LITERATE.The Primary Rundown is given in the TECH DIVISION (Div IV, Dept 11).(The TECH DIV may also give that portion of the Primary Correction Rundownwhich calls for Method 1 and Method 8 of the Primary Correction Rundown which isdescribed in HCO B 30 March 72 Revised 30 May 72.)SIMPLICITYThe Primary Rundown is very simple in its steps. Do NOT add things onto it. Donot do something else.HONESTYThe keynote of the Rundown is Honesty. The whole rundown can be wasted and thestudent fail and the End Phenomena missed if the student goes dishonest or he is justpushed for student points by the Supervisor.If done dishonestly the whole future study career of the student will be not onlymore difficult but may fail entirely.323"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"Honesty means don’t skip, don’t brush it off, don’t say it was done when it wasn’t.Later checks of auditing or administrative failures contain checks of the PrimaryRundown errors and honesty. The whole rundown would have to be done again.STEPS1. Verify if student’s Tone Arm on a meter is usually between position 2 and 3.If so he may proceed. If not he at once is sent to the Primary Correction Rundown as hiscase needs repair or handling before he can do the Rundown as mental mass will get inhis way and he may get upset. This step is checked by the Supervisor.(The Primary Correction Rundown is covered by HCO B 30 March 72 REVISED30 May 72. It consists of auditing and study correction actions.)2. If the Tone Arm is usually between 2 and 3 on the meter dial the person ismade into a Word Clear using Method 1 Word Clearing. (HCO B 30 June 71 RevisedIssue II, Revised 9 Aug 71, Revised 11 May 72, WORD CLEARING SERIES 8RB.) This isdone in the HGC or Dept 13 of Qual or may be done in a student Co-Audit. Failure to dothis step or do it well will make Study Tech difficult. A good job on this Method One willgive back a person’s education and send his Intelligence Quotient up. It is not a quickieaction. The person doing Word Clearing Method 1 on a person is doing an auditingaction. It has to be done well to achieve the final result of becoming a Word Clear.If any errors are made or the person does not F/N at the Examiner (where he goesafter each session for a meter check), HCO B 21 July 71 Revised (Revised 9 Aug 71, 31Mar 72), WORD CLEARING SERIES 35, the Word Clearing Correction List, is used. Itcan be used as often as there are upsets.This step should be done before the next step is begun as it makes the next step somuch easier.HCO P/L 19 Mar 72 Issue III, Word Clearing Series 34, HIGH CRIME POLICY, alsoapplies.3. If in doing Method 1 the person was found to be very deficient in Grammarand vocabulary, even though Method One was finished but took a very long time orcouldn’t be finished due to case, the person is sent to Dept 13 for the Primary CorrectionRundown.4. If the person did all right on Method 1, he is now put on Study Tapes. This isNOT just listening to Study Tapes, heaven forbid. This is HCO B 21 June 72 Issue IV,Word Clearing Series 41, METHOD 8.This is a long and careful cycle.It is completed in full.It consists of looking up every new word on the tape in a grammar or largedictionary and then listening to the tape.The full directions are given in HCO B 21 June 72 Issue IV, Word Clearing Series41, Method 8.5. The Student Hat is now done Method 8.This completes the Primary Rundown.If correctly done, the person will achieve the condition of Super-Literacy. This isfully described in LRH ED 178 International of 30 May 72.COURSE SUPERVISORIt is up to the Course Supervisor to hold this line in. His students will not prosper iftheir study is begun without a Primary Rundown.It is a high crime to omit this vital step.324"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"NO INTERFERENCE ZONEPersons who are on Solo Auditing between R6EW and OT III may not be put on aPrimary Rundown or a Primary Correction Rundown. See HCO B 16 Apr 72 Issue II.They may not be given Method 1 Word Clearing. They may only be Method 4edon Solo Instruction Materials.BUT THEY MAY NOT BE DEBARRED FROM STUDY.To all but those in the No Interference Area THE PRIMARY RUNDOWN IS THEREQUIRED FIRST STEP TO ALL STUDY.When on or after OT III, such persons must now do the Primary Rundown beforeany continuance of study. It now becomes Mandatory.CORRECTION RDThe Primary Correction Rundown takes care of people who have trouble on thePrimary Rundown.But do not lightly order the person to the Primary Correction RD. If they can getthrough the Primary Rundown with a bit of Supervisor time, let them go on through.But if they are nattery or upset or desperate even when given help, it is the PrimaryCorrection Rundown which will handle.Do not just get rid of a Class to Qual.DRUGSStudents who are or have been on Drugs need a Drug Rundown before tacklingMethod 1. Drugs fog up a student and prevent gains. And he loses the gains he gets.The answer is a full Drug Rundown. (See HCO B 25 Oct 71, “The Special DrugRundown”.) This will end off the drugs and let him live way above any plane he thoughtdrugs put him on.We handle drug cases so easily it is foolish not to take this obvious step. The reasonhe went on drugs or alcohol also comes off.Then he can study and retain what he learns.OPEN DOORThe Primary Rundown is the open door to brilliance.Super-Literacy is a new state for Man, existing in the past only in a few,accidentally, who became the geniuses and great names of the race.L.

BUT IF NOT WELL DONEOR MESSED UP OR DELAYED MUST BE DONE BY A PROFESSIONALAUDITOR AT THE STUDENT’S OWN EXPENSE.A STAFF MEMBER stalled on the Primary Rundown is put through the PCRDin Qual or Qual and HGC for different steps.Qualifications is the Correction Division. PCRD is a Correction action. Thereshould be word clearers in Qual. And these as Class IIIs should be competent to dosteps I to 9 of the PCRD.The object of a PCRD is not to stall the person and keep him off the PRD.The purpose of the PCRD is to get the person through the PRD.Where people have been put off the PRD for any reason and are not industriouslygoing through the PCRD IT IS UP TO QUAL TO MAKE SURE THEY DO GETTHROUGH PCRD AND PRD.Orgs that off load pcs or students on the thinnest excuses or Qual Divisions thatwill not service and speed the lines have to be watched as the discovery of trouble onthe PRD can be used to simply halt the student or pc. Instead of picking up the ball, aQual has been known to just send students back to class without handling or putstudents to “doing their hats” or other nonsense.The idea is to complete somebody on what they are supposed to complete.FOLDER STUDYIf you study the person’s folder, particularly a staff member’s, you will probablyfind that several of the steps 1 to 9 have already been done.These are checked off as done on the PCRD checklist.Any org that is worthy of the name has folder summaries in the inside left-handcover of the current folder. It is very easy to locate what have been done.326"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"OUT LISTSIt is not at all rare to find that various “whys have been found” but that the personis not doing well. This is a case of WRONG ITEMS and is handled by C/S Series 78.Thus steps I, 2, 3 and 6 of the PCRD may consist mainly of correcting botched uplists.IDLE STUDENTThe problem of putting someone off the PRD onto the PCRD is that he is now“idle as a student”. He cannot go forward on his studies as he has not done his PRD.In fact going on studying without the PRD is a waste of time as it’s mainlymisunderstood, glib and won’t be applied. It is actually faster to do a PRD (or aPCRD) and then study than it is to study without the PRD or PCRD. And it is certainlyfar more effective.The thing to do is to get the student who is assigned to the PCRD through thePCRD.As noted above he may have several points already done. And the rest can bedone easily and fast.RESISTIVE STUDENTSThere are situations where you have students or even executives who will noteven go to study.These are of course people who need the PCRD worst.But how to get them available even for that?In the case of a senior executive who will not study you can get a disarrangementof the study lines as they won’t push and will even impede study—for instance by notmaking staff go to study time or preventing them from going. Also policy and HCO Bsfall out or are not enforced and form of org is not held since reading and study aresimilar actions so standard actions are not known.Naturally such a thing has to be handled very fast.Because cooperation from such a student is VERY limited, time to do a wholePCRD is not possible.PRE-PCRDThere is a PRE-PCRD action that handles this.It has 2 steps.A. Assess Method 5 C/S 53RC. Take the LFBD item and INDICATE it to theperson. Don’t handle it or the rest of 53RC. Just Indicate it to the pc. Hewill usually agree and cognite. The TA will come down further and theneedle will float. That’s it.B. Now take the Study Correction List. Assess it Method 5. Pick out thebiggest LFBD you got. Indicate it to the pc. He will cognite, the TA willdrop down and an F/N will occur. That’s it.C. Put these 2 sheets in his pc folder for full handling of all reads by hisauditor and add them to the pc’s auditing program sheet inside the left frontcover of the pc’s folder.327"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"The result will often be magical. The person will become more agreeable aboutstudy or the Primary Correction Rundown.Of course they should now get a Primary Correction Rundown of which C/S53RC is the first step anyway.This Pre-PCRD gets them started. And it only takes a little while.The End Phenomena of a Primary Correction Rundown is “Can he now quicklyand easily do the Primary Rundown?” If yes, and if it works out in practice that he can,that’s it. Let him onto the Primary RD. But if he bogs, back to the PCRD.MORALThe moral of this HCO B is get them through the Primary Rundown. If they can’tor don’t go, do the PCRD. And if they’re shunted to the PCRD get it DONE. And getthem to the real EP which is SUPER LITERACY. The moral is, get them through.Don’t idle about. Get it DONE.Then they will whizz along on fast flow study and you’ve got COMPLETIONS.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1972by L.

These includethe right one: To face without flinching or avoiding. An example in a sentence: “Thetest of a free society is its capacity to confront rather than evade the vital questions ofChoice.”There is another meaning “To stand facing or opposing, especially in challenge,defiance or accusation.”English is a pretty limited language in many ways. I imagine the thought of facingsomething (which is what the word came from and originally meant way back—”fron”being “face”) was so horrifying to the types who write dictionaries they knew it wouldbe bad!In essence it is an action of being able to face.If one cannot, if he avoids, then he is not AWARE.Awareness is the ability to perceive the existence of. In the dictionary it also failsto confront that and says “Awareness: the quality or state of being aware.” And Awaremeans: “marked by realization, perception or knowledge.”So these chaps couldn’t confront and so conceived awareness to be figure-figure.We are moving out of the range of language when we want to say:“He could stand up to things and wasn’t always shrinking back into himself andavoiding, so he could be fully conscious of the real universe and others around him.”And that’s what Confront means.If one can confront he can be aware.If he is aware he can perceive and act.If he can’t confront he will not be aware of things and will be withdrawn and notperceiving. Thus he is unaware of things around him.That’s the tech of it.LRH:ntmjh L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1973, 1974 Founderby L.

WordClearing Technology is used to prevent the student losing interest because ofmisunderstood words.The tape players used must be equipped with a foot pedal start-stop control.The voice of the “sight” translator should be clear and the diction should be sharpand the tone should not be monotonous.A “sight” translator is one equally good in 2 languages who can hear onelanguage and speak the translation into the other language without hesitation. (They areemployed in the UN.)The material copied onto tapes can also be broken down into smaller reels forindependent study.By taking exact notes of the ‘‘auditing commands” and important rules the studentwill have the texts he needs for later reference.The exact rundown of this is given:In translating the materials of a course from a textbook or materials in onelanguage to another, the following steps are taken.PRIMARY TARGETS:1. A person fully competent in both the languages and their cultures is found andretained.2. The materials to be translated are made available.3. A tape recorder which can be started and stopped easily without leaving clicks onthe tape is procured. (Not a dictation machine.)4. An adequate supply of regular recording tape is made available.5. Other materials such as paper and ball-points are made available.6. A quiet place where interruptions and outside noises will not ruin the tapes is foundand the person is set up there.7. A person knowledgeable in the subject and the language in which the original iswritten is retained and assists the translator.349"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"OPERATING TARGETS:1. The translator (using Word Clearing Technology and a dictionary to clear up anymisunderstoods) rapidly reads or goes through the materials to get a general graspof the subject.2. The technical assistant who knows the subject and the original language now goesthrough the materials with the translator. Every technical word or phrase or culturalidiom is underlined.3. While underlining, the two persons decide on the correct translation of the technicalword or phrase.4. As these are decided, they are written down on note paper with a completedefinition.5. Each word, phrase and definition is translated into the language and written downon a separate sheet of paper.6. The translated words, phrases and definitions will become a mimeographed glossaryfor the eventual student.7. Each section and paragraph in the material is numbered.8. With this glossary to hand, the translator now begins direct translation of the textonto tape. The number of the tape and its materials is given at the beginning ofeach tape used or new chapter begun.9. The translator must be sure to read the materials in an interested voice and not letany hesitation or note of mystery creep in. The translator is actually lecturing andmust sound so.10. When the materials are complete, good production masters are copied off of themaster tape. The master tape is set aside and not used further.11. The production master is now cut into chapter lengths which are numbered thesame as the book chapters.12. Several sets of the Chapter Copies are now made and put in their boxes. Both trackscan be used. Even 4 tracks (not stereo) can be used.13. The glossary in both the original language and the translated language is printed upalong with course directions (which are described in another technical paper). Thechecksheet and course rules are also translated and printed in the local language.14. The course is boxed in sets with the glossary and course directions.Following this system one can rapidly produce sets of materials without the delaysalways experienced in printing as well as with cost reduction.The tapes are listened to on individual tape players equipped with earphones and afoot pedal start-stop control so the student’s hands are free for taking notes and lookingup words in the dictionary, etc).Learning rate in an aural society is much higher than in a society accustomed toprint.Even an illiterate person or a slow reader can be taught such a means.A dictionary in the translated language must also be available in a classroom.The quality of the translator’s voice and clear diction are highly desirable.LRH:nt.rd L.

It creates a demand for services. Thedemand for service must be met. An HAS Course in the language is not enough since itis not income producing. Thus the org could not survive financially. It must survivefinancially to deliver the service.Even in a total socialism the service would have to be given.Giving service depends on an org having the means of training auditors who canaudit well and establishing the organization. Then the org could audit preclears as wellas train more auditors.If the auditors who are trained can audit well, they will produce excellent resultsand public repute will spread.An org must produce to survive. By production is meant training auditors who canaudit, auditing pcs to a good result and making money, or in a total socialism, obtainingadequate support in ratio to production.If an org just teaches an HAS Course or tests people, it will not be able to survivefor it will not be able to obtain enough funds or support. For this it is vital to train lotsof auditors and audit lots of pcs.Without its staff knowing the basic data of organization, the org will havedifficulties in giving service. The technology of administration is important.Thus we get the MINIMUM materials in the language vital to an org’s survival:PRINTED MATERIALThe book DIANETICS: THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTHprinted with hard covers in the language is vital.When members of the public read it and take an HAS Course they want trainingor processing or both.This book placed in bookstores, advertised in magazines, and sold by Field StaffMembers and the org itself not only reaches the public but also in hardcover form paysfor its own distribution. As a paperback it does not pay for itself.351"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"To this add testing materials printed in the language for intelligence andpersonality testing and their marking directions.RECORDED TAPESRecorded tapes and tape players in the org to play to individuals in classes is theeasiest form in which to deliver data.From such tapes students may take notes.As time goes on the tapes will be transcribed and the material printed ormimeographed. (This is not to be done by the individual orgs.) It will be foundhowever that tapes will always be necessary even when some is printed as the volumeof data is very great.Students should not be permitted to print copies of their notes and sell them astime has shown that such notes are not accurate enough and spread errors that show upin training and auditing failures.In reviewing, a student must be sent back to the original, not to his notes, so hecan correct his notes and get the data accurately.Nearly all no-results are traced to altered data or poor training of the student,which amounts to the same thing.The MINIMUM list of tapes is: 1. Mini Course Supervisor Hat 2. HAS Course 3. HDC Course 4. Academy Courses Levels 0 to IV 5. Original Thesis 6. Notes on the Lectures 7. Hat of a Scientologist 8. Staff Status I 9. Staff Status II 10. A Translated Org Bd_________Given these bare essentials and teaching them well and using them will give anorg sufficient survival to deliver results.If every bit of the above is known and used by a staff they will not have too muchtrouble.Set up and functioning and solvent, an org can then think about further materials.Class VI, a Class VII, a Class VIII and a Class IX Course materials on tapeshould exist in a Saint Hill org in the language of that country.For the org itself a Volume Zero of the OEC Course should exist on tape.352"},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"After that the full Course Supervisor’s Course should exist.Then further books such as Dianetics ‘55!, Science of Survival and The Creationof Human Ability should come out as tape and then in published hardcover form.The full OEC should now be acquired on tape.The full Study Tapes should be to hand.The org will now be ready to use all the FEBC series and the FEBC tapes._________The hardest idea for an org staff to get is the idea of production in terms ofauditors trained who can audit, pcs audited to excellent results and money or supportproduced to keep the staff members and the org solvent.Because of this it is best for 2 or more bilingual executives to attain full FEBCtraining.However, with the above minimum materials fully studied and in use, an org cansurvive until it is ready to prosper._________Note, at this writing many are working hard to complete the listed materials. Theyare not yet available in all languages.There is only one other type of item needed by an org and that is the E-Meter.Supplies of these must be arranged for. A country running in very high volume willprobably manufacture its own meters against an exact prototype under existinginternational patents.ON SOURCEIt will be found in all countries where Dianetics and Scientology and orgs havebeen successful that a key part of the success was keeping the subject “on source”.The public at once distrusts persons or groups who alter the materials or “usesome of them” or attribute them to others. This is quite factual and the public is right.All great and lasting successes have been made by orgs that were on source andwhose materials were straight and correct and used that way.  L.

Keep this end very small. Long loose endsbreak off and can jam the machine.(b) The dull brown colored side of the tape must always face inwards against theplaying head when threading the tape. This is the side that Ron’s lectures are recordedon.(c) To wind back or fast wind the machine always press the stop key first. Harm isdone if the playing tape is suddenly switched over to reverse or fast forward by-passingthe stop button.(d) The magnetic materials of the earphones can harm the tape so never leave theearphones lying on top of an uncovered tape player.(e) Keep all dirt out of the tape player and when away from the player replace the lidto avoid dust entering into the machine.359"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"(f) Every care must be taken to avoid rough handling of tapes. Do not misplace tapesinto incorrect boxes and never permit loose ends to protrude out of the closed box.(g) Switch off the tape player when not in use (break time) and when you havefinished with the machine. This prevents overheating of inner parts and drive belts.(h) The tape counter indicator should be set at zero when you first start playing thetape. This counter will register your place whenever you stop the tape. Do not insert apiece of paper or anything else between the tape as a method of registering your place.(i) At the first sign of any fault with the tape player please call the Supervisor andreport what it is to him or her.(j) Twisting or knotting the earphone cord is strictly forbidden as this leads to innerwire breakage, which results in a concealed fault that can be difficult to locate.(k) The metal “playing head” across which the tape moves when playing must becleaned at regular intervals as it picks up dust from the tape resulting in blurred poorquality sound. This playing head should be cleaned after every 8 hours of playing timeor whenever the sound becomes blurred. The playing head is cleaned by use of a cottonswab on the end of a toothpick and cleaning fluid. This is wiped with firm pressureacross the playing head until the dirt and dust are removed and the metal is clean again.Great care must be taken not to scratch the playing head as the tape would then bedamaged as it passed across.(l) The tape player must also be demagnetized after every 8 hours playing time. Thisis done with a special demagnetizer designed for the purpose. The playing head and allthe metal parts on the tape “path” are demagnetized in this manner.These parts build up a magnetic attraction with continuous tape playing and thiscan be harmful to the quality of sound on the tape if not handled and removed as above.It is the Supervisor’s or Course Administrator’s responsibility to learn to do thisaction and to do it at least once per day on all tape players.(m) The moving parts of the tape machine mechanism also need regular cleaning andlubrication with a very fine lubricant. This procedure can be carefully learned by theCourse Administrator from a professional at the job and can be done by him thereafter.

Becausetapes have been almost uniformly misused in the past, these misunderstoods haveadded up to a general misunderstood on the subject of tapes themselves.Students have been known to copy down the whole tape so they could study it.This is a complete waste of time and misuse of student study hours.Some orgs even played advanced study tapes to the public.European orgs have even played translation quality tapes (usually not auditoriumquality) of OEC Volumes as raw public lectures! (And lost their audience through lackof quality and inaudible and strange words.)Casual staff briefing tapes, not okay for release, of very bad quality, have beenplayed to staffs of other orgs and the public.There is no end to the abuses.Therefore, for the benefit of understanding words alone, it is VITAL that tapes beproperly used and not abused.TYPES OF TAPESThere are four classes of tapes. These are:1. Course study tapes.2. Public lecture tapes.3. Briefing tapes.4. Model performance tapes.364"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"COURSE STUDY TAPESTapes made for courses are of two varieties:(a) English, usually by LRH.(b) Translations, done by translators.They are FOR COURSE USE. This is what the org sells—training on Tech orAdmin.These tapes appear on checksheets and are done at the points of checksheetswhere they are called for, and are done by Method 2 for tapes or Method 3 for tapes asrequired.The foreign language tape courses are done from a special tape checksheet and aredone exactly as laid down by Method 2 or Method 3.None of these tapes are all written out by the student and then studied. This is awaste of time.Further, such tapes are NOT played straight through with the student makingnotes of any misunderstood words “to look up later”. This will blank out the tapecontent on the student’s mind and knock out the student.So to play a course tape straight through to any student is to risk a stupidity and ablow. IT IS NOT DONE. It does not matter whether the student takes notes ofmisunderstoods or not. A COURSE TAPE IS NOT PLAYED STRAIGHTTHROUGH. Only the earphone, footpedal start-stop control procedures are used.A course tape is NEVER PLAYED TO A GROUP OF STUDENTS. Whenplayed to more than one student, some student is going to get a misunderstood andthere goes a blank student.Two students don’t even listen to a tape even on Method 2 Tape Word Clearing!One has the meter and footpedal and the other the earphones. The word clearer stops ateach read. He does not otherwise listen.Course tape quality must be good. All the words must be hearable and notinaudible. They must not be slurred or hard to make out.The earphones and tape player used must be high fidelity just any old earphoneswon’t do.The tape player “playing head” across which the tape passes must be clean—doneby a cotton swab on a toothpick and cleaning fluid. The tape coating comes off on theplaying head and after a time the sound is badly blurred.Using a course tape any other way is now FORBIDDEN. Tests have shown thatviolations of this are the reason for student failures and blows and out-Ethics.It goes without saying that the general handling of tape players and tapes must bewell learned and practiced by Course Supervisors and students.PUBLIC LECTURE TAPESThe probable reason stats fall after tape congresses is the misunderstood word.Congresses seldom use really high fidelity equipment. Further, tape copying isoften done by outside firms and the tape copies themselves may be of poor quality. Thecombination is deadly.365"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"We looked for the reason for stat drops after tape congresses and this is the onlyexplanation which has come forth.Doingness congresses that are mainly seminars have been very successful. (Bydoingness is meant TRs—training drills—and other ACTIONS.) The relay of data to apublic whose vocabulary is usually inadequate is not likely to win, as it hits their faultyvocabulary for one thing and uses new words for another. You can show somebodyhow to do things far better than you can tell him.This then extends into Div 6 Introductory Actions as well. The relay of datacomes AFTER the demonstration in action terms.The possibility of possible bad playing speakers, possible low tape copy quality,the barriers of languages not learned in the first place and the introduction of newmental concepts combine into a hurdle that makes tape or film public presentationadventurous.Listening to public type tapes, by using footpedal start-stop tape players, is beingput in a special public course category.Raw public tape and film presentations are however a must to keep the flavor andmeaning of Dianetics and Scientology. So ensure excellent quality tapes and equipmentare used with correct tapes for that public and you will have success.BRIEFING TAPESThese are not to be confused with Special Briefing Course Tapes.A briefing tape is done to brief or debrief missionaires or to record a conferenceor to record special instructions to a person or group. It can then be used for referenceor to settle any dispute. It can also be used to inform a staff or several staffs.A briefing tape is then a tape designed for a special and informed audience.If the tape quality is good and the audience is already a familiar or trainedaudience, a briefing tape can be played ONLY TO THE AUDIENCE FOR WHICH ITWAS INTENDED.To do otherwise is to risk misunderstood words and non-comprehension of whatit is all about in general.“Ron’s Journals” were staff briefing tapes. They began to be used for public.While they were not without success, one could no longer brief staffs on this line andthe line was therefore cut. One could not make them with a security that they would beplayed to staffs.An isolated briefing to a single executive on “these are our future hopes” has beenthereafter used as a staff briefing of many orgs as “these are your orders”.Any tape is designed for a specific public.Briefing tapes are especially subject to abuse by being played to wrong publics.Any briefing tape which contains specific orders and plans which could bemisunderstood should be played only to the individuals concerned with a stop-startfootpedal and Method 3 Word Clearing, not going past any misunderstood.After a person has been briefed verbally, it is very revelatory to then Word Clear2 the tape made at the same time. It will often be found that misunderstood words leadto potential alter-is in the actions required.366"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"Tape in this instance is an enormous help in assisting and clarifying briefings.A group can be briefed if thereafter each is Word Cleared Method 3 or 2 on thetape afterwards, using standard tape word clearing.Needless to say such tapes must be of good quality.MODEL PERFORMANCE TAPESTapes exist which give a standard of performance.In Dianetic and Scientology Auditing student auditors have never been known toachieve a high standard of session presence and Communication (and accordingly highresults) without the careful study of tapes made of similar sessions by high levelauditors.A student musician is unlikely to achieve professional performance level unless hehas heard a professional play.It would take a film or live demonstration to communicate a high standard ofperformance in a purely action subject. For instance for centuries no one believed thatRobin Hood could split his first target arrow with a second until a new generationworked on it and a few painfully recovered the lost art of archery and thendemonstrated how it was done for others to see.Tapes and films serve a vital purpose in maintaining a performance standard.As these tapes and films show HOW it is done and the ATMOSPHERE andRHYTHM of ACTION they are not subject to word clearing.CONCLUSIONTape and film training is vital, valuable and has its role.But like showing a child how to open a book and read, there is exact technologyin USING tapes and films.The first thing one must realize is that the use of tape and film is itself a technicalsubject that must be studied and learned. One does not naturally know it.The failures of universities to make educated and civilized men is because theirown professors know nothing of misunderstood words and so lectured happily on andon to a snoring student body. One professor of physics used to open the classroomwindows wide in freezing winter “to keep his students from going to sleep in HISclass”.

Points 10-19 have been revised.)Tape Course Series 7SETTING UP AND USING A TAPE PLAYERTapes of course materials must always be listened to through high quality high fidelityearphones. This permits the listener to be undisturbed by other noises in the area, as well as preventsothers from being disturbed by the tape being played. High fidelity earphones permit the listener tohave his undivided attention on the tape and produce a pleasant and easy to listen to sound whichclosely duplicates what is spoken on the tape.The tape player used must also be of high quality to reproduce the sound without adding to ordistorting what is on the tape. Poor quality sound is difficult and annoying to listen to and causesmisunderstoods by preventing the listener from hearing exactly what is said. Properly cared for andregularly maintained, a high quality player will last several times as long as one costing half as muchwhich never does produce a good quality sound.SETTING UP THE TAPE PLAYER1. The tape player is set up on a steady bench, table or platform at a comfortable height so thestudent can operate the controls easily when seated in front of it.2. If possible, the tape machines should be set up so that the student is facing the Supervisor of theCourse, rather than the student having his back to the Supervisor. This enables the Supervisorto spot easily if the student has gone dull or sleepy from a misunderstood word.3.The tape machine is plugged in, switched on, to check if the power is on and that the machine isoperating.4. The tape machine must be the type that is set up to operate with a start/stop foot pedal switch.These can easily be obtained and fitted to existing tape players that do not already have them.This is very important as the machine will be started and stopped many times by the student(with his foot on the pedal) while he is using his hands to look up words in the dictionary, fillin his checksheet, etc.The connected foot pedal is placed where it is in easy reach of the student’s foot.Test it to ensure it is working.5. The tape player “playing head” across which the tape passes, is checked to ensure that it is clean.The tape coating comes off on the playing head and after a time the sound is badly blurred.If the playing head appears dirty or the sound is blurred, the tape head must be cleaned. This isdone using a cotton swab on a toothpick and cleaning fluid. It is rubbed across the playing headuntil all the tape coating is removed.6. The tape that is to be heard is obtained and put on the player and set up for start-by passing the“coloured leader” on the tape past the playing head and onto the empty spool. Make sure it ispassed around the “roller guides” (designed to ensure it runs freely and doesn’t catch and tear onany sharp edges).368"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"7. Plug in the earphones, put them on, and switch on the tape to test them (to ensure they areworking and the quality of sound is good). Adjust the tone and volume to suitable levels. Switchoff the tape.8. Place a good dictionary, a “demonstration kit”, the Course checksheet and a notebook and penwhere they are in easy reach while seated at the tape machine.9. Set the “tape counter” at zero and the tape at the beginning (by winding it back if it has startedinto the Course lecture during the tests).USING THE TAPE PLAYER10. Play the tape at its correct speed.11.Listen to the tapes in the order they are entered on your Course checksheet.12. Mark off each item on your Course checksheet as you finish listening to it (or when you havechecked out on it if a checkout is required).13. Mark the “tape counter reading” of each item on your checksheet as that item begins on the tape.This gives you a reference by which you can find any item later on. You may be required torestudy some items by the Supervisor and you may want to hear some of them again yourself toclarify them with later tapes.14. If a word(s) or phrase on a tape cannot be understood, call for the Supervisor. The Supervisorlistens to the tape and if he can’t distinguish what is being said, with the help of the CourseAdmin, gets hold of the English text and locates the word or phrase, then using a good foreignlanguage dictionary translates the word or phrase for the student. This cycle should only take acouple of minutes.15. If a student bogs on listening to a translated tape, he is first Word Cleared. Should the confusionnot clear up, the translated tape is compared to the English material and if found to be atranslation error the Supervisor or Word Clearer, with the use of a good dictionary, translates theEnglish text correctly for the student. The Supervisor makes a note of the translation error byentering the error on a card which is placed in the Tape Box for student use, and sends a report toTU Chief Pubs DK.16. When rewinding a tape back a bit wait until the tape stops before you press the start buttonotherwise the tape is liable to break through mishandling.17. Rewind each tape onto its correct spool as you finish listening to it and turn off the tapemachine. Replace it in its box and return it to its correct place from which it came.18. Replace the cover on the tape machine when the machine has been finished with.19.

The tape machine and tape are set up exactly as per Tape Course Series 7, BTB25 Nov 71 R, Rev. 21 Nov 74, “Setting Up and Using a Tape Player”.2. Whilst listening to the tape, if the student hears a word he does not understand, heimmediately stops the tape by means of the foot pedal start-stop control.3. He writes the word down in his notebook and immediately looks up the wordexactly per BTB 4 Sept 71R, Rev. 15 Dec 73, Word Clearing Series 22R, “Howto Use a Dictionary”, clearing all definitions and any not understood ormisunderstood words in the definitions, and putting each into sentences.4. Student then checks the tape for the exact use of the word in the tape.5. Student then rewinds the tape to just before the word cleared above and relistensto the section to ensure that it is understood.6. The student continues listening to the tape until he encounters another word whichhe does not understand, at which point he does the actions outlined in 3, 4 and 5above.7. If at any point the student becomes bored, feels blank, washed out, not there,starts yawning, dopes off or wants to blow, he must recognize that he has gonepast a misunderstood word.8. The student must turn the tape back to the point where he was interested and alertand check the section just after that for the misunderstood word or words, andclear them according to steps 3, 4 and 5.9. The student then rewinds the tape back to the end of the section where he felt fineand relistens to the tape from that point on, picking up and clearing any otherwords found.370"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"10. If the student starts to feel squashed, gets a headache, stomach feels funny, getsdizzy from time to time, or eyes start to hurt, the student should locate the sectionon the tape where he had a lack of mass, and either go and find the actual massunder discussion and feel and inspect it, if possible, or find a photo of it, ordemonstrate the mass in clay with labels, or use his demo kit to demonstrate themass. The student should then relisten to the rest of the tape from that section on. 11. The Supervisor must be alert to the manifestations of lack of mass andmisunderstood words and quickly see that the correct handling is done rapidly. Ifhe does not handle, he will shortly end up with no students.12. If a student cannot locate the misunderstood word using Method 3, either on hisown or with the Supervisor, the Supervisor should apply Method 2 WordClearing to that section of the tape to quickly locate and handle the misunderstoodwords. If the student’s TA is above 3.5 or below 2.0, end off and send thestudent to Qual for a C/S 53RI.13. A Supervisor should check students who have just completed a tape and looktired or not there, by asking questions about the tape. If the student cannot answeror gives a wrong or altered answer, the Supervisor should make the student goback and relisten to the tape and find and clear the misunderstood words.The above procedure is very simple and the essential ingredients to have F/Ningstudents who know and can apply their materials.

It is done then and there in the classroom or Qual and does not requireC/S OK.This is done by locating and clearing the word that caused the E-Meter needle toread (small fall, fall, etc).The student having Method 2 Word Clearing done on him holds the cans of the E-Meter (E-Meter electrodes) while he listens to the tape. He does nothing else, other thanlisten to the tape.PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING STUDY DIFFICULTY ON A TAPE,WITH METHOD 2 WORD CLEARING1. The tape machine has been set up as in BTB 25 Nov 71R, Reissued 7 July 74 asBTB, Revised 21 Nov 74, Tape Course Series 7, “Setting Up and Using a TapePlayer”.2. The student, the classroom Word Clearer and the Course Supervisor have beenusing Method 3 Word Clearing as in Tape Course Series 8, BTB 26 Nov 71R,Revised & Reissued 17 Aug 74 as BTB, Revised 21 Nov 74, “HandlingMisunderstood Words on Tape Recorded Materials”.3. The student is having trouble with the tape or the subject. The difficulty hasn’tbeen resolved and the word causing the trouble hasn’t been located.4. The Course Supervisor or a trained Word Clearer now takes over to handle thedifficulty with Method 2 Word Clearing.372"},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"5. The student either takes the tape he is having trouble with to the Supervisor/WordClearer’s desk (where another tape machine and an E-Meter are set up)—or theSupervisor takes an E-Meter and sets it up at the student’s tape machine.6. The student is asked at which point on the tape he became bogged. He is thenasked for the point on the tape when he was doing OK. The tape is then reversedto the exact end point of where he was doing well. The first MU will be just afterthat and there may be others.7. The Supervisor/Word Clearer operates the foot pedal start-stop control of the tapemachine as well as the E-Meter, and does worksheets of the Word Clearing.8. The student listens to the tape. He also holds the cans of the E-Meter while he islistening to the tape. If the student’s TA is above 3.5 or below 2.0, send thestudent to Qual for rapid C/S Series 53RI handling and return to course.9. As the tape plays, the Supervisor/Word Clearer watches his Meter needle. Assoon as the needle reads (small fall, fall, etc) the Supervisor/Word Clearer stopsthe machine by use of the foot pedal, and asks the student for the misunderstoodword.It is extremely important that the Supervisor/Word Clearer stop the tape player atthe exact moment of the Meter read, otherwise he may be asking the student forthree or four or even six or eight words later than the reading word, and thuscause undue difficulty for the student.10. If the student can’t spot the word, the Supervisor/Word Clearer replays the lastshort section to assist the student to find the MU.11. If the student still can’t spot the word, the Supervisor/Word Clearer turns the tapeback a little further and replays that whole section, using the tape counter numbersto guide his stopping and starting actions. He locates the MU.12. All misunderstood words on tapes are cleared according to BTB 4 Sept 71R,Rev. 15 Dec 73, 20 July 74, WC Series 22R, “How to Use a Dictionary”,clearing each word to F/N.13. The student keeps hold of the cans and the Supervisor/Word Clearer locates theword in the dictionary, understands the definition himself and then holds it for thestudent to read.14. The student reads all definitions out loud whilst the Word Clearer watches theneedle in order to pick up any MUs in the definitions.15. The Word Clearer ensures that the student puts each definition into sentences toensure the word is fully understood, to F/N.16. The Word Clearer ensures that the student has clarified the exact definition of theword as used in the tape, and plays back that section of the tape for the student, inorder to ensure it is cleared.17. The tape is now turned back to the beginning of the section where the student raninto trouble to double check that it is now resolved. There should be no reads,and F/N, on that section of the material.If there are any more reads, these are picked up and cleared, and the sectionreplayed again, until there are no more reads on that section, and F/N on therepair.18. The trouble is now resolved and the student is returned to normal study, where heis expected to apply Method 3 Word Clearing as a routine.373"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"19. If the student’s difficulty has not resolved, the student is sent to Qual for a WordClearing Correction List, which will locate the cause of the trouble.20. The student is returned to Course when the difficulty has been located andhandled, resulting in an F/Ning student.METHOD 2 WORD CLEARING AS A STUDY METHODON TAPE MATERIALSOn some professional checksheets or special staff training actions, all thematerials of the course are required to be done Method 2 Word Clearing. Also whenearliest materials are being Word Cleared Method 2.Method 2 done for this purpose has steps as follows.A. The Case Supervisor OK must be obtained to ensure that the student is not in themiddle of a major auditing rundown or process or due for an InteriorizationRundown, etc. (Word Clearing M2 can be done between the processes of aprogram.)B. The tape player is set up as given earlier.C. Note: If the student has a high or low TA on the Meter (above 3.5 or below 2.0after the Meter has been turned on for a few minutes to warm up and the canshave been warmed by the student holding them for a few minutes) or if thestudent is in pain or upset—the Word Clearer does not start metered WordClearing. The Word Clearer informs the student, “I’m sorry we will not bestarting Word Clearing at this time.” The Word Clearer reports this in writingwith the student’s TA position to the Supervisor who forwards the report to theDPE so that the needed C/S Series 53RI session can be given the student. Thismust be done quickly so he can be gotten on to his Word Clearing. The student isimmediately called in for C/S 53RI handling to the result of an F/Ning student atwhich point the student is returned to his course.D. Starting the Word Clearing is done by informing the student, “I am not auditingyou.” The tape is then started and the procedure is as given earlier in this BTB forMethod 2. The only difference being that the whole materials are covered in thismanner with the Word Clearer taking up and clearing all reading words (and anywords originated by the student as misunderstood).E. Each word handled is cleared to Floating Needle on the Meter.F. The Word Clearing period is ended on Floating Needle.G. Note: If the Word Clearing bogs down and it can’t be resolved, the Word Cleareror Supervisor must end off and send the Worksheets to the Review Auditor inDept 14 at once, who will handle by doing a Word Clearing Correction List.

Asecondary factor is that using transcripts is easier for the Sight Translator andconsequently speed of production and morale are increased.The method for translating taped lectures is as follows:1. The Translator is provided with a typed transcript of the taped lecture. Transcriptsused must be expertly done and edited so they read well.2. The Translator (using Word Clearing Technology and a dictionary to clear up anymisunderstoods) rapidly reads or goes through the transcript to get a generalgrasp of the subject.3. The Technical Assistant who knows the subject and the original language nowgoes through the transcript with the Translator. Every technical word or phrase orcultural idiom is underlined.4. While underlining, the two persons decide on the correct translation of thetechnical word or phrase.5. As these are decided, they are written down on notepaper with a completedefinition.6. Each word, phrase and definition is translated into the language and written downon a separate sheet of paper.7. The translated words, phrases and definitions will become a mimeographedglossary for the eventual student.8. With this glossary to hand, the Translator then takes the transcript to the recordingbooth and begins direct translation of the transcript onto tape. At the beginning ofthe tape the tape is copyrighted, title of the tape and number are given.9. The translated master tape is then given to the recording engineer who handles themaking of Production Masters, editing, copying. In other words, gets the tapeprepared for distribution.379"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"10.

Hemust be able to do this without having to listen to all of the tapes or a whole tape eachtime he wants to find a particular piece of data from an issue.Tape counters are used by students listening to a translated tape course to keep arecord of where the issues are located on the tape. As the student listens to the itemsthrough the tape, he writes the tape counter reading (as the item begins) beside the itemon the checksheet.This gives him a tape counter reference for each item and makes it easy for anyspecific item on the tape to be located swiftly if he needs to listen to it again.So tape course checksheets contain the tape numbers of each tape, and a space forthe tape counter reading.The following is the exact procedure used by Translations Units in making tapecourse checksheets.A. The translator takes the English checksheet of the course he has translated ontotape and translates the checksheet onto paper with these additions:1. Just before the first item on the checksheet is a brief explanation of the tapecourse. (See attached sample for text.)2. The translator leaves more space than usual between items on the checksheetso there will be room to include the tape numbers on the checksheet.3. An extra column is put at the beginning margin of each checksheet item fornoting the tape counter reading of each item on the tape.B. Next, the tape numbers themselves must be entered on the checksheet,designating where each tape begins.For example: 12 09 71 would be the number of the tape made on the 9th day ofthe 1 2th month (Dec.) 1971.In addition to the tape number, the course and sequence are written out on thechecksheet, with the tape number below it, i.e: HSDC—Tape 1 Side A  Tape Number (120971)All of this is entered in a “square” on the checksheet. An addition is madealongside this square as below:381"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"eg.HSDC—Tape l Side A Note: (Be sure to reset your tapeTape Number (120971) counter reading to Zero.)The procedure for entering the tape numbers on the checksheet is as follows:1. A full set of the tape copies (NOT Master tapes or Production Masters) forthat particular course is obtained. The copies must be arranged in the propersequence (Tape 1, Tape 2, etc), and must be in their labelled tape boxes.2. The first tape is picked up, and the label on the back of the tape box is read.This label will list the items that are on the tape in the order they occur onthe tape.The translator (or another person who speaks the language) looks at thislabel to determine the first item on the first side of the tape (Side A).3. He then locates the same item on the checksheet, and enters the tape numberjust above that item on the checksheet.4. He puts a “square” around the tape number on the checksheet.5. Alongside the square he adds: (Be sure to reset your tape counter reading toZero.)6. He then looks at the side B of the tape box label and repeats steps 2-5.7. The same steps 2-6 are done with each tape for that course.C. The final checksheet is checked on all the above points before being given OK togo to mimeo for issue.D. The checksheet is sent to mimeo, where it is typed on stencils, proofread, and runoff.The final product is in the same format as the attached sample.ADDITIONAL NOTESIt must not be assumed that tape course checksheets for the same course will bealike from language to language.Translators speak at varying speeds, so the number of items on each tape will alsovary. Thus the first item on each tape will be different for each language.All of the above steps must be done for each course in each language.This special format for tape translated course checksheets appears on the attachedsample. It is to be used in all tape course translations.SAMPLETAPE COURSE CHECKSHEET FORMAT:(COURSE NAME)Usual Course introduction plus______________________________________________(Student’s Name)(Org Name)etc, etc.382"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"The material on this checksheet has been translated onto tape into your ownlanguage.Play the tapes in the order shown on the checksheet and indicated on the tapeboxes.Sign your initials for every recorded item (bulletin, etc) on the checksheet whenyou have finished listening to it.The name of every separate item is given on the tape before the item is recorded.Fill out the column “tape counter” with the numbers at the beginning of everyitem.

Then it is fully defined by dictionary. Theword is then used several times in sentences of the student’s own verbal composing.The misunderstood area is then reread until understood.(3) Verbal in classroom: The student says he does not understand something. TheSupervisor has him look earlier in the text for a misunderstood word, gets the studentto look it up, use it verbally several times in sentences of his own composition, thenread the text that contained it. Then come forward in the text to the area of the subject hedid not understand.If any other word clearing is going on it is OUT tech.There is a C/S on HCOB 30 June 71 to be followed exactly on word clearing in asession.

They are three different sets of symptoms.(1) Education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will beinvolved is very hard on the student.It actually makes him feel squashed. Makes him feel bent, sort of spinny, sort ofdead, bored, exasperated.If he is studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent this willbe the result.Photographs help and motion pictures would do pretty good as they are a sort ofpromise or hope of the mass but the printed page and the spoken word are not asubstitute for a tractor if he’s studying about tractors.You have to understand this data in its purity—and that is that educating a personin a mass that they don’t have and which isn’t available produces physiologicalreactions. That is what I am trying to teach you.It’s just a fact.You’re trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and you’re not giving him anytractors—well he’s going to wind up with a face that feels squashed, with headachesand with his stomach feeling funny. He’s going to feel dizzy from time to time and veryoften his eyes are going to hurt.It’s a physiological datum that has to do with processing and the field of themind.You could therefore expect the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that fieldof education most devoted to studying absent masses.This one of studying the something without its mass ever being around producesthe most distinctly recognizable reactions.If a child felt sick in the field of study and it were traced back to this one, thepositive remedy would be to supply the mass—the object or a reasonable substitute—and it would clear it up.-------------(2) There is another series of physiological phenomena that exist which is basedon the fact of too steep a study gradient.That’s another source of physiological study reaction because of too steep agradient.393"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"It is a sort of a confusion or a reelingness that goes with this one.You’ve hit too steep a gradient.There was too much of a jump because he didn’t understand what he was doingand he jumped to the next thing and that was too steep and he went too fast and he willassign all of his difficulties to this new thing.Now differentiate here—because gradients sounds terribly like the 3rd one ofthese study hang-ups, definitions—but remember that they are quite distinctly different.Gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness but they still hang overinto the field of understanding. In gradients however it is the actions we are interestedin. We have a plotted course of forward motion of actions. We find he was terriblyconfused on the second action he was supposed to do. We must assume then that henever really got out of the first one.The remedy for this one of too steep a gradient is cutting back. Find out when hewas not confused on the gradient, then what new action he undertook to do. Find whataction he understood well. Just before he was all confused what did he understandwell—and then we find out that he didn’t understand it well.It’s really at the tail end of what he understood and then he went over the gradientyou see.It is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness.That’s the gradient barrier and one full set of phenomena accompanies that.-------------(3) There is this third one. An entirely different set of physiological reactionsbrought about through—a bypassed definition. A bypassed definition gives one adistinctly blank feeling or a washed-out feeling. A not-there feeling and a sort ofnervous hysteria will follow in the back of that.The manifestation of “blow” stems from this 3rd aspect of study which is themisunderstood definition or the not comprehended definition, the undefined word.That’s the one that produces the blow.The person doesn’t necessarily blow on these other two—they are notpronouncedly blow phenomena. They are simply physiological phenomena.This one of the misunderstood definition is so much more important. It’s themake-up of human relations, the mind and subjects. It establishes aptitude and lack ofaptitude and it’s what psychologists have been trying to test for years withoutrecognizing what it was.It’s the definitions of words.The misunderstood word.That’s all it goes back to and that produces such a vast panorama of mental effectsthat it itself is the prime factor involved with stupidity and the prime factor involvedwith many other things.If a person didn’t have misunderstoods his talent might or might not be presentbut his doingness would be present.We can’t say that Joe would paint as well as Bill if both were unaberrated in thefield of art, but we can say that the inability of Joe to paint compared with the ability of394"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"Joe to do the motions of painting is dependent exclusively and only upon definitions—exclusively and only upon definitions.There is some word in the field of art that the person who is inept didn’t define orunderstand and that is followed by an inability to act in the field of the arts.That’s very important because it tells you what happens to doingness and that therestoration of doingness depends only upon the restoration of understanding on themisunderstood word—misunderstood definition.This is very fast processing. There is a very swift wide big result obtainable inthis.It has a technology which is a very simple technology.It enters in at the lower levels because it has to. This doesn’t mean it isunimportant, it means it has to be at the entrance gates of Scientology.It is a sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education and don’t neglect it.You can trace back the subject a person is dumb in or any allied subject that gotmixed up with it. The psychologist doesn’t understand Scientology. He neverunderstood a word in psychology so he doesn’t understand Scientology.Well that opens the gate to Education. Although I’ve given this one of themisunderstood definition last it is the most important one.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rd jhCopyright © 1971, 1974by L.

I’ve got it narrowed down to this.Apparently no matter how many times the study tapes have been played, nobodyhas ever heard of them.I watched a recent course run to find out how deep they would let the studentsstruggle—how long it would stay bogged—and it would have stayed bogged from hereon out !And do you know what’s out?It’s the study data tapes just that—and that’s all that’s out on a course.So when they say “2-way comm the students” you’ll find the Supervisors instantlystart to itsa them and are using auditor 2-way comm on these courses. It doesn’t belongon these courses.I’ll give you now the total dialogue of a Supervisor:The Supervisor shows interest. There can be a little bit of chatter, like—”I seeyou’ve just completed. Great!”—something like that, or he shows interest—”How areyou doing?”Student replies—”Ah well, I’m doing all right.”Supervisor—”Now are there any words there in that, that you havemisunderstood?”Student—”No ... no....”Supervisor—”Well what is the word that you didn’t quite understand?”Student—”Ah well . . . ah . . . this one.”Supervisor—”Good. Now look that word up.... Now what’s the word in theparagraph above that, where’s that? . . . Alright let’s look that up. Now use it in asentence a couple of times and I’ll be back in a minute.”He comes back, the student gives him the sentences for it and straightens it out andhe sees the student’s got it.396"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"That’s the 2-way comm of a Supervisor.If a Supervisor does any other thing you’ve got a wrecked course. I’ve got theproof of it.The way you teach a TR Course is you give the student the bulletin and you havehim read it. You don’t check the guy out on the bulletin, he just reads it.When you come back you say, “Alright, have you read it?”“Yeah. I’ve read it.”“What word don’t you understand on it?”You will find things like HCO B and TR, and you get those cleared up, etc.I am having some roaring success stories from FEBC students who are through this.One had gone through the bulletin 10 times and had found words he didn’t knowall 10 times, and he was all of a sudden finding new things on the bulletin that he’d neverheard of before.Another student had gone through it 20 times with the same result and they weredoing fine and getting down to TRs and passing them.On a TR Course you give them the bulletin and let them read it and you find whatword they didn’t understand. That’s the routine.Now that sounds so impossible—and it’s been on the study tapes for so long—thatyou wouldn’t believe that this thing is the key.Do you know there were students there for 15 or 20 days until we started doing this,then all of a sudden there was a breakthrough and their enthusiasm started coming up.They had been just going lose, lose, lose, out the bottom because Supervisors wereletting them itsa.Maybe Supervisors thought they were auditors.They aren’t.Neither are they supposed to give advice or tell students how—or ask them if theyblinked or anything else.The other thing they were doing was only emphasizing all the “can’ts”.The students just went into despair.This was because the Supervisors were inviting all kinds of itsa and criticizing andso forth.You may say, “Gee! Everybody knows it’s a misunderstood word.”Yeh—but they don’t use it.Now I’ll give you another one.I set up a test so that each student was brought up to the D of T who had a meter onhis desk and he’d ask them if they had anything they misunderstood—and see if they gota read on the meter.If it didn’t clear up at once he’d send them back to get the definitions and look thething up and of course use the word in a couple of sentences and then if it didn’t clear uphe’d send them to the word clearer and really let them get worked over because it goesway back.They even found a student who had a misunderstood word clear back into his lastlife.397"},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"There wasn’t any other 2-way comm and no other interest and they just about blewthe roof off with student stat points.This is the action of a Supervisor and that’s ALL the action a Supervisor does—andhe can do that.The course has plenty of dictionaries and so on.But, the main point is, it is the misunderstood word. This has been proven again.On a TR practical course it’s the misunderstood word and the misunderstoodaction.On other courses it’s just misunderstood words and misunderstood words andmisunderstood words, one right after the other.As fast as they clear this up—up the student’s production goes.It’s painfully slow on some of them at first and I suppose the Supervisors have somany misunderstood words of their own that they just won’t key into doing this actionand that’s what’s wrecking courses.It’s elementary, and it’s the wildest discovery of all time but they don’t use it.If it is used, your courses start running fast, your students start learning quickly andall starts going well.Other course outnesses like Supervisors not giving anybody a pack or no one togive checkouts are all Administrative outnesses.As far as actual Supervision is concerned it’s this other line of handlingmisunderstood words.The second that line is in there are wins all over the place.The second that line is out there is no delivery.If auditors are goofing, then in their training they have not been made to look upthe misunderstood word and a lot of itsa has gone on and people have evaluated for them.Then these auditors having made mistakes they never corrected with this tech, think theyneed something new to run on pcs, but they just wreck new tech too.We are shooting for a target, using just this misunderstood word tech, of a reductionof time by about a third on all major courses.Just using this misunderstood word tech. That’s all.If some student is a totally slow student, you can get him back to the first bulletin orbook he ever read and make him get every word in it he didn’t understand, and it will goup in a chain.People on courses were being itsa’d to death.

That’s all there is to teaching a course as far as thetechnology goes.It’s contained in the few words which I have just given you and there’s no othertechnology.That’s all there is to teaching a course because that’s all that’s wrong withstudents.You can monitor it this way. You can watch a student’s stats day to day. His statsare down today compared with yesterday’s so you go over and talk to him. He says,“Yes. I had a hard night last night, up all night arguing with my wife,” etc—whichcould go on for hours.But the Supervisor says, “Now yesterday or today what word did you run acrossthat you didn’t understand?”The meter gives a LF.He says, “Yes! Well I didn’t understand the word ‘waffle-waffle’.”The Supervisor says, “Well let’s look it up and get it defined.”399"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"The student says, “Well it wasn’t that word, it was the word before that.”Supervisor, “Good—let’s get this looked up and used a couple of times in asentence.”The student does and he gets an F/N and it’s all fine.His study stats go back up.That’s all there is to it!There are two ways to fail to communicate the tech. One is not to read the HCOBs and the other is not to use the misunderstood word tech.(Of course you can have no course and nobody there even trying.)The worst thing would be to pretend to have a course but have missing materialsand Supervisors giving verbal advice or tech. That is deadly and will turn any Academysour.Verbal tech comes about when course materials are not available to students andno or faulty Word Clearing is used.As long as the Administration of the course is in and all the course materials areavailable, the sole course Tech is this misunderstood word tech.

The F/N went off long before the student reached the point of dope-off, sowaiting for dope-off to occur before handling is waiting too long.Let us look at this from the point of view of the tone scale.If you consider that each student who is not at tone 5.0 during study has amisunderstood WORD—and if you do something about the misunderstood word—thenyou can drive up study velocity so that all students are flying along as F/Ning students.(It’s not a misunderstood phrase or idea or concept but a misunderstood WORD.)This always occurs before the subject itself is not understood.In comparison with waiting for dope-off to occur before handling themisunderstoods, this method is like high level auditing where slowed F/Ns are taken asreads—rather than TA rise being the read.An estimation of the tone level of students on one course showed them at aboutplus or minus 2.5.This would mean many students had a very tight meter needle if we compare themto the F/Ning student who is flying along successfully.This could be remedied.If you had this problem of a group of students at tone 2.5 it could be approachedthis way:1. Set up one or more Word Clearers in the classroom.2. Start with the faster study students, but not those at tone 5.0 or above.3.If TA above 3.5 or below 2.0 send to Qual for a C/S 53RI.4. Word Clearer inspects student stats graphs and locates with simple two-waycomm what was being studied at the specific period just before the graph levelledor started to go down. If the graph has not done either but just maintained at a lowlevel, the Word Clearer selects out the earliest materials on the course.402"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"5. Do Method 4 on the materials selected on each student, taking each word to F/N.6. Any student with BIs which do not clear up, or who runs into trouble on Method4 is sent to Qual for WCCL.7. Push back the action so it’s done within the first few days of course for all newstudents, once all existing students are handled.8. Keep in the M4 for all new students within the first few days as a standard action.9. Do Method 4 or use other Methods of Word Clearing on all course students at thefirst sign of a non-F/Ning student.By eliminating all these slows (misunderstood WORDS), the students’ averagepoints will rise and you will get all students flying along as F/Ning students.The above actions can be done on all students who are not at tone 5 or above oncourses, whether Super literate or on Fast Flow courses.These are organizing actions to speed production flow, which can be donewithout shattering stops such as “all students off course onto TRs”.Quality will rise as well as speed.

WORD CLEARING SUCCESS FROM FLAG D OF T:“When Ron put in full Word Clearing technology the FEBC daily student pointsaverage was greatly increased.“First a Supervisor finds the misunderstood word using M3 Word Clearing. If hecan’t and doesn’t resolve it then another Supervisor or Word Clearer would find itusing the meter (M4).“If we couldn’t find the word and resolve it, the student would get other methodsof Word Clearing.“The word was always found on one of these steps.“The students soon became conscious of exactly what caused them to bog—evenslightly—before full dope-off.“It’s another incredible piece of technology.  Jon Horwich  Flag D of T”B. SUCCESSES FROM SUPER VISOR—WORD CLEARING:“I found out meanings for words that I hadn’t known before. It’s a good action.W.T.”“What a maze of unbelievable confusion can lead back to a simple littlemisunderstood word. Wow! What a win. Thank you.S.T.”“The only reason a person gives up a study or feels bored about it is because ofmisunderstood words. Since I started clearing all the words things are different. I wasplanning to leave the OEC—now I’m looking forward to finishing it.W.P.”“Word Clearing! Again when LRH says a misunderstood word or symbol isbehind all problems in study he means it.

Damn—just do it like it says and what a winner!!! It was so good I told my friend and she’sgoing in to get some too. Boy you can really have enormous wins doing this WordClearing as per HCO B. Yes Sir! !S.C.”“I just want to put down in a success form the wins I’ve had from the WordClearer. Having him available to find that one word has helped me speed through thecourses I’ve had. He may just sit in the course out of the way seeming to beunimportant at times but he is truly a big aid to all students. If you’re having trouble—use the Word Clearer.C.T.”D. SUCCESSES FROM SESSION WORD CLEARING:“I just cleared up a whole load of misunderstoods on targeting and also on theBureaux System. I was amazed how problems on targeting could originate from basicmisunderstoods on photography (of all things) and how Bureaux went back toproblems in filling out my tax forms for the Government (Jeez! Those tax forms arereally screw-ball).“Thanks to Ron and my Word Clearer.J.B.”“I just had a great Word Clearing session. It really cleared some big things up. Ireally loved it. It’s very very basic and powerful.R.L.”“It was fantastic! I found a basic big fat ‘rat’ (laughing) called enforced religionand blew it. A lot of things were intermingled with disagreement and protest. I reachedseveral basics and felt tremendous relief to cast off another lie. Thank you Ron for thistech.M.O.”“The Word Clearing session I had was really terrific. I thought I didn’t have anymisunderstoods as I always ‘look them up in the dictionary’, but in the session Iunearthed basic misunderstoods which had caused me to go into apathy aboutdiscovering things about life—and the reason for blowing from earlier subjects andthrowing away old abilities. I’m very excited about what Word Clearing can do. It’slike a Grade as it restores ability.“My thanks to LRH, for this great tech, and to my Word Clearer, for a greatsession.P.M.”“What an experience!

Students are finding misunderstoods all over thetrack and blowing tons of charge—brightening up and getting on with it.W.V.”“If you consider the main purpose of Word Clearing to assist the student to studyfaster and easier, then it’s always but always successful. Yet in the time I’ve beendoing it I’ve seen case changes and other phenomena which I can only describe asfantastic through finding and clearing words by any of the 3 methods.“In a great percentage of students I’ve seen major case changes. A year’s hang-up on a Dynamic disintegrate on locating and clearing a couple of words. A remarkableexteriorization on finding a very basic word. A renewed enthusiasm for a five-yearcontemptuously discarded subject, achieved in less than half an hour. The ‘sourest’ ofpeople turns into a very cheerful person. Several ‘chronic high TA’ cases blow downfrom 5.0+ and float. Extreme natter and upset gradually fade right away as words werefound and located. An amazing return of recall (whole track) and certainty, and manymore I could name.“It’s the first time I’ve spent so much time on a specialized rundown and itsometimes takes a great deal of confront and persistence to get through a student’sconfusion but you can be certain that by persisting, no matter which method you’reusing, you will always always always increase that student’s understanding.“And often as a bonus give him a major case win (especially in the auditingrundown).“I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.

Make him do this as long as it isbringing the TA down. If you get into trouble with him go back and find the misunderstood youmissed.Keep hunting and keep working at it and his misunderstood words will blow and his inability tounderstand the post will blow.EXPLANATIONFailed posts and duties trace back to misunderstood words. Until you see it you won’t believe it.One student who had studied his post for a third of a year was given Method 2 on its materials.It took 15 hours of Method 2 work, protests, blows, upsets to finally discover that he did notknow what POST meant! OR what the words in the title meant.Another person studied half a year to be an administrator. Yet when he was given his personnelorders appointing him, and Method 2 was done on them, in the first 50 words of the personnel orderthere were 13 individual misunderstood words each one of which related to the post and were simpleEnglish. A similar ratio continued throughout the personnel order.He was about to fail with a fanfare. Behind post failure the explanation IS misunderstood words.Psychosis (evil intention) is the only other reason for failure but even this can be handled byauditing today. And even psychosis lessens when misunderstood words are handled.SUCCESSESIt is not difficult to use Method 2 Word Clearing.One must be able to handle ARC Breaks, Problems and withholds and read a meter.One must have a very big dictionary available when little ones fail.One must be persistent and not buy explanations or let the person run away.And the Successes one has are fantastic!LRH:sb.rdL.

METHOD NO. 2: A WORD READS. STUDENT SAYS HE KNOWS THE MEANING OFTHE WORD AND WORD CLEARER DOES NOT TAKE IT UP.When a word is isolated as having read always get all its definitions defined with the dictionaryand used in several sentences.2. METHODS NO. 2 & NO. 3: ASKING THE STUDENT FOR THE MEANING OF WORDFOUND.Always get it defined with the dictionary.3. ALL METERED METHODS: PUTTING THE STUDENT ON CANS AND STARTING HIMREADING BEFORE TA HAS SETTLED. LOSES EARLY READS BY ADJUSTING TA.4. ALL METERED METHODS: NOT CONTINUING TO USE A WORD IN SENTENCESWHEN DOING SO IS BRINGING THE TA DOWN.5. ALL METERED METHODS: NOT HAVING STUDENT ON CANS TO INTERROGATEHIM AS TO WHICH TEXT MUST BE LOCATED TO WORD CLEAR.6. ALL METERED METHODS: NOT USING SUFFICIENT 2WC TO LOCATE THE BOGGEDAREA.7. ALL METERED METHODS: WORD CLEARER CALLING WORD TO METER TOCHECK “IF IT READ OR NOT”.8. ALL METERED METHODS: TELLING STUDENT “THAT WORD READ”.9 . ALL METHODS: ABANDONING A WORD.If it’s not in your dictionary, get another or get the reference for the word from the Supervisor.Never leave it and try to carry on.10. ALL METERED METHODS: ALLOWING STUDENT OFF THE CANS TO LOOK UPWORDS.11. ALL METHODS: NOT ASKING A STUDENT WHO STILL DOESN’T COMPREHENDAFTER READING DICTIONARY, WHAT WORD IN THE DEFINITION HE DOESN’TFULLY UNDERSTAND.If that doesn’t handle, go back to the word just cleared and pick up any by-passed definition.Clear it up with dictionary definition, use in sentences and come back to original word.424"},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"12. ALL METHODS: USING OR ACCEPTING “WAITING FOR A METHOD NO. 1” AS ANEXCUSE NOT TO STUDY OR TO DO WORD CLEARING.13. ALL METHODS: ALLOWING EXCESSIVE ITSA OR TALK.Note: Don’t cut cognitions that occur after clearing a word.14. METHODS 2, 3, 4, 7, 9: NOT OBSERVING WHEN YOU HAVE HANDLED THECURRENT DIFFICULTY (AND ENDING OFF).15. ALL METHODS: NOT GOING EARLIER ON SOMEONE WHO IS “ALWAYS LOOKINGUP THAT WORD”.Find an earlier time on the course he encountered that word. Have him read just prior to it. Clearthe word found. You should now be able to terminatedly clear the troublesome word in the usualway.16. ALL METERED METHODS: NOT REPORTING TO THE C/S ANY CASES WHOSE TA’SARE HIGH AND DON’T COME DOWN OR WHOSE TA’S ARE BELOW 2.0 OR WHOROCK SLAM.17.

It indicates who has to be word cleared FAST, at once, NOW, before dutiesgo off the rails any further.B. It detects the area just before which there is a misunderstood word.A is useful to the administrator. Knowing it and knowing Word Clearing andbeing able to do it himself or get it done, he can avoid wholesale dismissals, frantictransfers, general inefficiency and organizational strain.B is very useful to the Word Clearer.Example of B. A person can do everything on an order except “File the Folder’s”which he insists on delivering to a wrong room. Look over the order and find where init talks about filing folders. Just above or beside that will be a misunderstood word.Locate it, get it identified, defined and used in sentences.

They read.It takes a BIG dictionary to define these simple words fully. This is anotheroddity. The small dictionaries also suppose everybody knows.It is almost incredible to see that a university graduate has gone through years andyears of study of complex subjects and yet does not know what “or” or “by” or “an”means. It has to be seen to be believed. Yet when cleaned up his whole education turnsfrom a solid mass of question marks to a clean useful view.A test of schoolchildren in Johannesburg once showed that IntelligenceDECREASED with each new year of school!The answer to the puzzle was simply that each year they added a few dozen morecrushing misunderstood words onto an already confused vocabulary that no one evergot them to look up.Stupidity is the effect of misunderstood words.In those areas which give Man the most trouble you will find the most alterationof fact, the most confused and conflicting ideas and of course the greatest number ofmisunderstood words. Take “economics” for example.The subject of psychology began its texts by saying they did not know what theword means. So the subject itself never arrived. Professor Wundt of Leipzig Universityin 1879 perverted the term. It really means just “a study (ology) of the soul (psyche)”.But Wundt, working under the eye of Bismarck, the greatest of German militaryfascists, at the height of German war ambitions, had to deny Man had a soul. So therewent the whole subject! Men were thereafter animals (it is all right to kill animals) andMan had no soul, so the word psychology could no longer be defined.THE EARLIEST MISUNDERSTOOD WORD IN A SUBJECT IS A KEY TOLATER MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS IN THAT SUBJECT.“HCO B” (Hubbard Communications Office Bulletin), “Remimeo” (Orgs whichreceive this must mimeograph it again and distribute it to staff), “TR” (Training Drill),427"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"“Issue I” (first issue of that date), are the commonest misunderstoods. Because theyoccur at the beginning of an HCO B!Then come words like “a”, “the” and other simple English as the next words thatoften read.In studying a foreign language it is often found that the grammar words of one’sown language that tell about the grammar in the foreign language are basic to not beingable to learn the foreign language.The test of whether the person understands a word is “does it read on the meter asa fall when he reads the word in the material being cleared”.That a person says he knows the meaning is not acceptable. Have him look it upno matter how simple the word is.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:sb.rdCopyright © 1971by L.

By getting these out of the way, it is nowpossible to clean up current materials much more rapidly with Method 2, where theperson is put on a meter and reads the material to another who is watching the meterand catching each read.With Method I out of the way, Method 2 becomes more rapid.Method 3 will then be done by the person himself because he now knows better.No. 2 and No. 3 can be used on and on one or the other.If you do it backwards, beginning with Method No. 3, much more time isconsumed. If Method No. 2 is used without No. I being done, much more work has tobe done to clean up an existing piece of study material or text.So the correct sequence is No. 1, No. 2 and then No. 3.This does not mean you cannot start with No. 3 or No. 2. It just means it is muchfaster to do them in correct sequence.PURPOSE CLEARINGWhen purpose of the post is to be cleared it is done after Method No. 1 in generaland Method No. 2 has been done on the duties and texts of the post.With all such material handled with word clearing it is time then to do a PurposeClearing of the person’s job or situation in life.PROGRAMThus a general program could be laid down as1.

The misunderstood word islooked up in the dictionary and the meaning read out loud and they tell you what theword means so that they know it WITHOUT AGAIN REFERRING TO THEDICTIONARY. Then the word is used in several sentences which clearly indicate that itconsults their understanding.WORDS SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFERENT OR MORE THAN ONEMEANING. YOU HAVE TO KNOW EVERY DIFFERENT MEANING SO ALLDEFINITIONS ARE LOOKED UP AND THE WORD IS FULLY DEFINED. YOUALSO MUST CHOOSE THE DEFINITION IN USE IN THE SENTENCE SO THATTHE MATERIALS ARE UNDERSTOOD.THE ALPHABETKnowledge of the alphabet is the key to finding words quickly. The alphabetmust be known cold. The Word Clearer who has to figure out which letter comes first,M or N or U or V, wastes many precious minutes which add up to many wasted hours.Words are arranged in alphabetical order in all dictionaries. All words beginningwith the letter A would be in the first section, all words beginning with the letter B inthe second section, and so on. Within these sections the words themselves are arrangedso that each second letter in the word is in alphabetical order. (For example, the wordfall precedes the word few, which precedes the word field, etc.)Near the top of each page, printed in bold type, are the first word and the lastword on the page (in very large dictionaries it’s every two columns). You can use thisas a guide to quickly find the page that contains the word you are looking for.HOW TO BREAK UP A WORDMany words are in a combined form and by separating the word you can look upeach part in the dictionary. By doing this, the meaning of the word often becomesclearer. Take the word Theo-logy. The first part, Theo- means god or gods and thesecond part of the word, -logy means discourse or expression or the science, theory orstudy of. When you put the two parts together, you have the science, theory or study ofgod. Sometimes in combining forms of words, a letter is changed, as in the word in-dividu(e)-ate.LOOK UP WORDS IN THE DEFINITIONMany times when looking up a word, you will find in its definition other wordswhich need to be looked up in order to understand the meaning of the original word.Therefore, each word given in the definition must also be clearly defined andunderstood so that there are no underlying misunderstood words on the word you arelooking up. Large child’s dictionaries are good as the definition words are simple.The so-called “Merriam Webster” dictionaries in the U.S. are almost useless and giveout more misunderstoods in definitions than they clarify in clearing, don’t bother with431"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"them. The World Book Dictionary available from Field Enterprises EducationalCorporation, Merchandise Mart Plaza, Chicago, Illinois, 60654, U.S.A. is a huge andvery good child’s dictionary. In the U.K. the 18 volume Oxford series are good.USE A BIG ENOUGH DICTIONARYThe smaller dictionaries (paperback or junior) seldom contain complete definitionsof a word. Sometimes a most vital part of a definition is omitted. This can involverunning around to look for another dictionary or missing the real meaning of the word.So always use a big enough dictionary.GET THE WORD USED IN SENTENCESAS LONG AS IT HAS TAThe word, when it reads on the meter, is used over and over in sentences until ithas no more TA. It doesn’t matter if the word was looked up in the dictionary as theword will still read if the word is misunderstood.The dictionary usually has several examples of use. These are not enough. Theperson has to make up several of his own before he really knows the word.WORDS OF A SPECIAL TECH REQUIRE A DICTIONARY OF IT IF POSSIBLE.Many students have been or are engaged in technical professions outside ofScientology such as engineering, computer programming, architecture, etc, and youwill need a glossary or dictionary of the terms involved in these technologies.When Word Clearing someone on his post hat aboard the Flagship or astationship you would need a nautical dictionary.BACK TRACK WORDS—GET THE EARLIER MISUNDERSTOOD WORDVery often you will get a word off the track and you won’t find it in anydictionary or glossary on this planet. You must get the earlier misunderstood word untilyou get the basic word that was misunderstood.FOREIGN WORDS—GET A DICTIONARY OF THAT LANGUAGEThere are two kinds of foreign language dictionaries. One is a dictionary entirelyin the foreign language. The other is the English/Foreign language dictionary, in whichone half of the dictionary is English words with the foreign word next to it, and theother half is the foreign word with its English counterpart next to it. You would use theall foreign dictionary only with a person who knew that language fluently.YOU USE A DICTIONARY.

This requires no extrastep. In fact it would be rather hard not to also see the definition of the word.A person trying to “blow” (leave) and refusing further Word Clearing almostalways has a HUGE misunderstood on some word not yet located. The correct action isto get him back and FIND AND CLEAR THE WORD.Not getting a good result using Methods 1, 2 or 3 is cured by using the WordClearing Correction List, HCO B 21 July 71, Revised 9 August 71.This Correction List applies to all methods of word clearing.For instance, if Method 2 goes sour and the student “knew all the words anyway”or “doesn’t understand it any better” or is critical or demonstrates any other unfavorablereactions which do not win through, there is always Word Clearing Correction List.This list is done by a Class III or above auditor. It is quite miraculous.Example: Student badly bogged after Method 2 by his twin. Handling: A Class IIIauditor does the Word Clearing Correction List on him.The Correction List is handled as per HCO B 14 Mar 71, “F/N Everything”. Inother words, one takes all reads on it to Floating Needle. Any other list called for byreads on the Correction List is taken to F/N and when that called-for list F/Ns then oneconsiders that the Word Clearing Correction List line has F/Ned. (Correction List readson 4. List Error. The auditor takes a list called L4B which corrects lists and makesevery read on “L4B” F/N. Then “4. List Error” is marked “F/N”.)The technology of handling a Word Clearing Correction List is all covered in thegeneral materials of auditing.Not knowing how to use a Meter can cause trouble.A special Course in using an E-Meter is available. The E-Meter Drill Book givesall the drills. It does not take long to learn. Also E-Meters are abundantly availabletoday.Learning to be a Class III or preferably a Class IV Academy Auditor is notdifficult IF one uses word clearing!All word clearing is done under the discipline of The Auditor’s Code.One’s “TRs” (TR = Training drills for auditing) can be straightened out on a TRCourse on which one learns to confront, to speak so one can be heard, to acknowledge,to be able to repeat commands and to handle originations by the student.433"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"Troubles in word clearing, then can be listed as coming from lack of training. Soanyone doing word clearing should organize himself to (I) Do a TR Course, (2) Learnto use and acquire an E-Meter, (3) Learn the Auditor’s Code and, (4) If not onealready, learn to be an Academy Class III Auditor.Knowing how to do 1 to 3 above is essential to do Method 2 Word Clearing. Andthe skills under (1) to (3) are very easy to acquire. Further, it is not all that difficult tobecome a Class III Auditor.People sometimes think only someone who wants to be a professional auditorstudies in the Academy, a false impression. One can’t imagine how a father orbusinessman or mother or clerk or official could succeed without knowing the basics ofhuman reaction and how to handle them. Someone who is a Class III or Class IVknows how. The real professional usually becomes a Class VI and the real experts arethe VIIIs, IXs and Xs. It’s a matter of how expert you want to be. A Flag Ship ClassXII could turn a severe mental case from raving lunacy to not only sane but bright andnormal in about 8 or 9 hours and a normal person to a genius in 15 to 20 hours.But here we are dealing with the whole range of the human mind.In word clearing Method 2 one certainly should know his “TRs”, his Auditor’sCode and his Meter. And for Method I it takes a Class III Academy Auditor.Almost all troubles will be found to stem from an omission of these requirementsAND not using Word Clearing on the materials one is studying to achieve these skills.Very few troubles actually will be encountered if this HCO B is followed.Word Clearing IS a precision technology and there IS something to know about itas it has never before been known.

Several, includinglarge ones, should be to hand. Those that use big words to define words keep a pcchasing around and around and are of course poor dictionaries. Often one dictionarygives a better definition than another. So an assortment of English dictionaries is a firstrequirement.Then come technical dictionaries or texts like engineering, physics, medical,chemistry, mechanics, seamanship, aviation, astronomy, military, etc, etc.Then come philosophical, psychiatric and religious dictionaries if they can befound.Foreign language dictionaries Latin, Greek, French, etc are a must.An auditor doing word clearing can come up with some remarkable demands.Texts or dictionaries covering the subject given on the assessment list (WordClearing Series 8RR) are a basic starter.I can see a word clearing auditor poking about in old mouldy bookshops andcoming up with triumph—”Ah, look! Priceless. A slang dictionary on oil fieldspublished in 1932! Priceless!”If you get too stopped and are in a major city, you could end the session and sendthe pc to the local library. But if so have him write the definition down. It is notrecommended but can be done.The best solution is to have a good library covering the assessed subjects.  L.

Becausetapes have been almost uniformly misused in the past, these misunderstoods haveadded up to a general misunderstood on the subject of tapes themselves.Students have been known to copy down the whole tape so they could study it.This is a complete waste of time and misuse of student study hours.Some orgs even played advanced study tapes to the public.European orgs have even played translation quality tapes (usually not auditoriumquality) of OEC Volumes as raw public lectures! (And lost their audience through lackof quality and inaudible and strange words.)Casual staff briefing tapes, not okay for release, of very bad quality, have beenplayed to staffs of other orgs and the public.There is no end to the abuses.Therefore, for the benefit of understanding words alone, it is VITAL that tapes beproperly used and not abused.TYPES OF TAPESThere are four classes of tapes. These are:1. Course study tapes.2. Public lecture tapes.3. Briefing tapes.4. Model performance tapes.436"},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"COURSE STUDY TAPESTapes made for courses are of two varieties:(a) English, usually by LRH.(b) Translations, done by translators.They are FOR COURSE USE. This is what the org sells—training on Tech orAdmin.These tapes appear on checksheets and are done at the points of checksheetswhere they are called for, and are done by Method 2 for tapes or Method 3 for tapes asrequired.The foreign language tape courses are done from a special tape checksheet and aredone exactly as laid down by Method 2 or Method 3.None of these tapes are all written out by the student and then studied. This is awaste of time.Further, such tapes are NOT played straight through with the student makingnotes of any misunderstood words “to look up later”. This will blank out the tapecontent on the student’s mind and knock out the student.So to play a course tape straight through to any student is to cause a stupidity anda blow. It also does not matter whether the student takes notes of misunderstoods ornot. A COURSE TAPE IS NOT PLAYED STRAIGHT THROUGH. Only theearphone, footpedal start-stop control procedures are used.A course tape is NEVER PLAYED TO A GROUP OF STUDENTS. Whenplayed to more than one student, some student is going to get a misunderstood andthere goes a blank student.Two students don’t even listen to a tape even on Method 2 Tape Word Clearing!One has the meter and footpedal and the other the earphones. The word clearer stops ateach read. He does not otherwise listen.Course tape quality must be good. All the words must be hearable and notinaudible. They must not be slurred or hard to make out.The earphones and tape player used must be high fidelity just any old earphoneswon’t do.The tape player “playing head” across which the tape passes must be clean—doneby a cotton swab on a toothpick and cleaning fluid. The tape coating comes off on theplaying head and after a time the sound is badly blurred.Using a course tape any other way is now FORBIDDEN. Tests have shown thatviolations of this are the reason for student failures and blows and out-Ethics.It goes without saying that the general handling of tape players and tapes must bewell learned and practiced by Course Supervisors and students.PUBLIC LECTURE TAPESThe probable reason stats fall after tape congresses is the misunderstood word.Congresses seldom use really high fidelity equipment. Further, tape copying isoften done by outside firms and the tape copies themselves may be of poor quality. Thecombination is deadly.437"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"We looked for the reason for stat drops after tape congresses and this is the onlyexplanation which has come forth.Doingness congresses that are mainly seminars have been very successful. (Bydoingness is meant TRs—training drills—and other ACTIONS.) The relay of data to apublic whose vocabulary is usually inadequate is not likely to win, as it hits their faultyvocabulary for one thing and uses new words for another. You can show somebodyhow to do things far better than you can tell him.This then extends into Div 6 Introductory Actions as well. The relay of datacomes AFTER the demonstration in action terms.The possibility of possible bad playing speakers, possible low tape copy quality,the barriers of languages not learned in the first place and the introduction of newmental concepts combine into a hurdle that makes tape or film public presentationadventurous.Listening to public type tapes, by using footpedal start-stop tape players, is beingput in a special public course category.Raw public tape and film presentations are however a must to keep the flavor andmeaning of Dianetics and Scientology. So ensure excellent quality tapes and equipmentare used with correct tapes for that public and you will have success.BRIEFING TAPESThese are not to be confused with Special Briefing Course Tapes.A briefing tape is done to brief or debrief missionaires or to record a conferenceor to record special instructions to a person or group. It can then be used for referenceor to settle any dispute. It can also be used to inform a staff or several staffs.A briefing tape is then a tape designed for a special and informed audience.If the tape quality is good and the audience is already a familiar or trainedaudience, a briefing tape can be played ONLY TO THE AUDIENCE FOR WHICH ITWAS INTENDED.To do otherwise is to risk misunderstood words and non-comprehension of whatit is all about in general.“Ron’s Journals” were staff briefing tapes. They began to be used for public.While they were not without success, one could no longer brief staffs on this line andthe line was therefore cut. One could not make them with a security that they would beplayed to staffs.An isolated briefing to a single executive on “these are our future hopes” has beenthereafter used as a staff briefing of many orgs as “these are your orders”.Any tape is designed for a specific public.Briefing tapes are especially subject to abuse by being played to wrong publics.Any briefing tape which contains specific orders and plans which could bemisunderstood should be played only to the individuals concerned with a stop-startfootpedal and Method 3 Word Clearing, not going past any misunderstood.After a person has been briefed verbally, it is very revelatory to then Word Clear2 the tape made at the same time. It will often be found that misunderstood words leadto potential alter-is in the actions required.438"},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Tape in this instance is an enormous help in assisting and clarifying briefings.A group can be briefed if thereafter each is Word Cleared Method 3 or 2 on thetape afterwards, using standard tape word clearing.Needless to say such tapes must be of good quality.MODEL PERFORMANCE TAPESTapes exist which give a standard of performance.In Dianetic and Scientology Auditing student auditors have never been known toachieve a high standard of session presence and Communication (and accordingly highresults) without the careful study of tapes made of similar sessions by high levelauditors.A student musician is unlikely to achieve professional performance level unless hehas heard a professional play.It would take a film or live demonstration to communicate a high standard ofperformance in a purely action subject. For instance for centuries no one believed thatRobin Hood could split his first target arrow with a second until a new generationworked on it and a few painfully recovered the lost art of archery and thendemonstrated how it was done for others to see.Tapes and films serve a vital purpose in maintaining a performance standard.As these tapes and films show HOW it is done and the ATMOSPHERE andRHYTHM of ACTION they are not subject to word clearing.CONCLUSIONTape and film training is vital, valuable and has its role.But like showing a child how to open a book and read, there is exact technologyin USING tapes and films.The first thing one must realize is that the use of tape and film is itself a technicalsubject that must be studied and learned. One does not naturally know it.The failures of universities to make educated and civilized men is because theirown professors know nothing of misunderstood words and so lectured happily on andon to a snoring student body. One professor of physics used to open the classroomwindows wide in freezing winter “to keep his students from going to sleep in HISclass”. And then stood on the platform and defined nothing as he rambled on. All it didfor his class was give them coughs between snores!The handling and use of tape and film in training and administration IS a subject.By failing to know it and use that information, one can block the road for himselfand all others to being learned and being free.

The tape machine and tape are set up exactly as per Tape Course Series 7, BTB25 Nov 71 R, Rev. 21 Nov 74, “Setting Up and Using a Tape Player”.2. Whilst listening to the tape, if the student hears a word he does not understand, heimmediately stops the tape by means of the foot pedal start-stop control.3. He writes the word down in his notebook and immediately looks up the wordexactly per BTB 4 Sept 71R, Rev. 15 Dec 73, Word Clearing Series 22R, “Howto Use a Dictionary”, clearing all definitions and any not understood ormisunderstood words in the definitions, and putting each into sentences.4. Student then checks the tape for the exact use of the word in the tape.5. Student then rewinds the tape to just before the word cleared above and relistensto the section to ensure that it is understood.6. The student continues listening to the tape until he encounters another word whichhe does not understand, at which point he does the actions outlined in 3, 4 and 5above.7. If at any point the student becomes bored, feels blank, washed out, not there,starts yawning, dopes off or wants to blow, he must recognize that he has gonepast a misunderstood word.8. The student must turn the tape back to the point where he was interested and alertand check the section just after that for the misunderstood word or words, andclear them according to steps 3, 4 and 5.9. The student then rewinds the tape back to the end of the section where he felt fineand relistens to the tape from that point on, picking up and clearing any otherwords found.440"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"10. If the student starts to feel squashed, gets a headache, stomach feels funny, getsdizzy from time to time, or eyes start to hurt, the student should locate the sectionon the tape where he had a lack of mass, and either go and find the actual massunder discussion and feel and inspect it, if possible, or find a photo of it, ordemonstrate the mass in clay with labels, or use his demo kit to demonstrate themass. The student should then relisten to the rest of the tape from that section on.11. The Supervisor must be alert to the manifestations of lack of mass andmisunderstood words and quickly see that the correct handling is done rapidly. Ifhe does not handle, he will shortly end up with no students.12. If a student cannot locate the misunderstood word using Method 3, either on hisown or with the Supervisor, the Supervisor should apply Method 2 WordClearing to that section of the tape to quickly locate and handle the misunderstoodwords. If the student’s TA is above 3.5 or below 2.0, end off and send thestudent to Qual for a C/S 53RI.13. A Supervisor should check students who have just completed a tape and looktired or not there, by asking questions about the tape. If the student cannot answeror gives a wrong or altered answer, the Supervisor should make the student goback and relisten to the tape and find and clear the misunderstood words.The above procedure is very simple and the essential ingredients to have F/Ningstudents who know and can apply their materials.

It is done then and there in the classroom or Qual and doesnot require C/S OK.This is done by locating and clearing the word that caused the E-Meter needle toread (small fall, fall, etc).The student having Method 2 Word Clearing done on him holds the cans of the E-Meter (E-Meter electrodes) while he listens to the tape. He does nothing else, other thanlisten to the tape.PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING STUDY DIFFICULTY ON A TAPE,WITH METHOD 2 WORD CLEARING1. The tape machine has been set up as in BTB 25 Nov 71R, Reissued 7 July 74 asBTB, Revised 21 Nov 74, Tape Course Series 7, “Setting Up and Using a TapePlayer”.2. The student, the classroom Word Clearer and the Course Supervisor have beenusing Method 3 Word Clearing as in Tape Course Series 8, BTB 26 Nov 71R,Revised & Reissued 17 Aug 74 as BTB, Revised 21 Nov 74, “HandlingMisunderstood Words on Tape Recorded Materials”.3. The student is having trouble with the tape or the subject. The difficulty hasn’tbeen resolved and the word causing the trouble hasn’t been located.4. The Course Supervisor or a trained Word Clearer now takes over to handle thedifficulty with Method 2 Word Clearing.442"},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"5. The student either takes the tape he is having trouble with to the Supervisor/WordClearer’s desk (where another tape machine and an E-Meter are set up)—or theSupervisor takes an E-Meter and sets it up at the student’s tape machine.6. The student is asked at which point on the tape he became bogged. He is thenasked for the point on the tape when he was doing OK. The tape is then reversedto the exact end point of where he was doing well. The first MU will be just afterthat and there may be others.7. The Supervisor/Word Clearer operates the foot pedal start-stop control of the tapemachine as well as the E-Meter, and does worksheets of the Word Clearing.8. The student listens to the tape. He also holds the cans of the E-Meter while he islistening to the tape. If the student’s TA is above 3.5 or below 2.0, send thestudent to Qual for rapid C/S Series 53RI handling and return to course.9. As the tape plays, the Supervisor/Word Clearer watches his Meter needle. Assoon as the needle reads (small fall, fall, etc) the Supervisor/Word Clearer stopsthe machine by use of the foot pedal, and asks the student for the misunderstoodword.It is extremely important that the Supervisor/Word Clearer stop the tape player atthe exact moment of the Meter read, otherwise he may be asking the student forthree or four or even six or eight words later than the reading word, and thuscause undue difficulty for the student.10. If the student can’t spot the word, the Supervisor/Word Clearer replays the lastshort section to assist the student to find the MU.11. If the student still can’t spot the word, the Supervisor/Word Clearer turns the tapeback a little further and replays that whole section, using the tape counter numbersto guide his stopping and starting actions. He locates the MU.12. All misunderstood words on tapes are cleared according to BTB 4 Sept 71R,Rev. 15 Dec 73, 20 July 74, WC Series 22R, “How to Use a Dictionary”,clearing each word to F/N.13. The student keeps hold of the cans and the Supervisor/Word Clearer locates theword in the dictionary, understands the definition himself and then holds it for thestudent to read.14. The student reads all definitions out loud whilst the Word Clearer watches theneedle in order to pick up any MUs in the definitions.15. The Word Clearer ensures that the student puts each definition into sentences toensure the word is fully understood, to F/N.16. The Word Clearer ensures that the student has clarified the exact definition of theword as used in the tape, and plays back that section of the tape for the student, inorder to ensure it is cleared.17. The tape is now turned back to the beginning of the section where the student raninto trouble to double check that it is now resolved. There should be no reads,and F/N, on that section of the material.If there are any more reads, these are picked up and cleared, and the sectionreplayed again, until there are no more reads on that section, and F/N on therepair.18. The trouble is now resolved and the student is returned to normal study, where heis expected to apply Method 3 Word Clearing as a routine.443"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"19. If the student’s difficulty has not resolved, the student is sent to Qual for a WordClearing Correction List, which will locate the cause of the trouble.20. The student is returned to Course when the difficulty has been located andhandled, resulting in an F/Ning student.METHOD 2 WORD CLEARING AS A STUDY METHODON TAPE MATERIALSOn some professional checksheets or special staff training actions, all the materials ofthe course are required to be done Method 2 Word Clearing. Also when earliestmaterials are being Word Cleared Method 2.Method 2 done for this purpose has steps as follows.A. The Case Supervisor OK must be obtained to ensure that the student is not in themiddle of a major auditing rundown or process or due for an InteriorizationRundown, etc. (Word Clearing M2 can be done between the processes of aprogram.)B. The tape player is set up as given earlier.C. Note: If the student has a high or low TA on the Meter (above 3.5 or below 2.0after the Meter has been turned on for a few minutes to warm up and the canshave been warmed by the student holding them for a few minutes) or if thestudent is in pain or upset—the Word Clearer does not start metered WordClearing. The Word Clearer informs the student, “I’m sorry we will not bestarting Word Clearing at this time.” The Word Clearer reports this in writingwith the student’s TA position to the Supervisor who forwards the report to theDPE so that the needed C/S Series 53RI session can be given the student. Thismust be done quickly so he can be gotten on to his Word Clearing. The student isimmediately called in for C/S 53RI handling to the result of an F/Ning student atwhich point the student is returned to his course.D. Starting the Word Clearing is done by informing the student, “I am not auditingyou.” The tape is then started and the procedure is as given earlier in this BTB forMethod 2. The only difference being that the whole materials are covered in thismanner with the Word Clearer taking up and clearing all reading words (and anywords originated by the student as misunderstood).E. Each word handled is cleared to Floating Needle on the Meter.F. The Word Clearing period is ended on Floating Needle.G. Note: If the Word Clearing bogs down and it can’t be resolved, the Word Cleareror Supervisor must end off and send the Worksheets to the Review Auditor inDept 14 at once, who will handle by doing a Word Clearing Correction List.

Course Word Clearing can be done on a student currently being audited.2. An F/N does not have to be obtained (by rudiments or talking the TA down)before Course Room Word Clearing can be started.3. If the TA is high (above 3.5) or low (below 2.0) or the student is upset (orbecomes upset) this must be reported at once to Department 14 and handled by aWord Clearing Correction List or C/S 53RI.4. Course Room Word Clearing must be started with the statement “I am notauditing you”.5. Course Room Word Clearing does not have to be C/Sed. (Worksheets must bemade however, and sent to the student’s preclear folder.)6. The student does not have to see the Pc Examiner after having metered WordClearing on course; but the Student C/S should be alert for any flubs, especiallywords not cleared to F/N.7. If a Tech Word Clearer flubs or causes upsets on Word Clearing, the correctaction is for the Supervisor to send the Word Clearer to Cramming. Qual cramsall flubs in Word Clearing.8. All metered Classroom Word Clearing takes each word to F/N.9. A Supervisor can order any student who is not an F/Ning student to WordClearing.10.

The “EP” has been reached.When the word clearer forces the student to go on beyond this, the reads gottenare often false or are from protest.Reads that are false come from cognitions (realizations) on the material. Protestreads come from just plain annoyance with having to go on.When the EP of 2 is reached on a specific set of materials, the student is thenpermitted to go on by himself, looking up words he doesn’t know or going back to findone that was missed.A person who enters a new subject or a new branch of a subject should be givenWC2 on it. A person who begins a higher level of a subject should be given WC2 on it.If thereafter there is any bog or failure to understand or apply or pass an exam onthe subject, a WC Correction List can be done on it and the bog found and handled.This EP is only valid if the person has had WC Method 1 before the WC Method2 was begun.The EP of Method 2 can be many times repeated on different subjects or branchesof subjects.

The F/N went off long before the student reached the point of dope-off, so waiting for dope-off to occur before handling is waiting too long. As soon asyour study stats dropped for half a day or you aren’t quite so “bright” as you were afew minutes ago is the time to look for the misunderstood word. (It’s not amisunderstood phrase or idea or concept but a misunderstood WORD.) This alwaysoccurs before the subject itself is not understood.This is Method 3 Word Clearing:1. The student notices he is not flying along and is not “bright” or it could be justplain lack of enthusiasm or too long on one item on the checksheet or yawning ordisinterest or doodling or daydreaming, etc.2. He then looks earlier in the text for a misunderstood word. There is one always,there are no exceptions. It may be that the misunderstood word is two pages ormore back, but it is always earlier in the text from where he is now.3. The word is found. He recognizes it in looking back for it. If the student can’tfind the misunderstood by looking back for it, he can get another student to spotcheck him. The other student takes words from the text that could bemisunderstood and asks: “What is the definition of the word ?” seeing if thestudent gives a correct definition.448"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"4. The student looks up the word found in a dictionary, thoroughly clears eachdefinition and uses it verbally several times in sentences of his own compositionuntil he has obviously demonstrated that he understands the word by thecomposition of his sentences—and feels fine about it.5. Then the student reads the text that contained the misunderstood word. If he isn’tnow “bright”, eager to get on with it, back up tone, etc, then there is anothermisunderstood word earlier in the text. This is found by repeating steps 2-5.6. When he is bright, up tone, etc (an F/Ning student), the student comes forwardfrom where the misunderstood word was in the text to the area of the subject hedid not understand (where step 1 began).He will now be enthusiastic with his study of the subject unless a misunderstoodword was missed, not fully cleared, or there’s an earlier one in the text. If so, do steps2-5. If the student is now enthusiastic, he continues on with studying.Students do NOT have to be Word Cleared Method 2 on the total of any course.Method 3 Word Clearing can be used by students on each other or by aSupervisor or Word Clearer whenever necessary.

E.g. Cramming Officers use it to fish formisunderstood words concerning what the person is being crammed on. Word Clearers use it on Internswhen the Intern needs a retrain or retread or even if the Intern is sent to Cramming. Course Supervisorsuse it in the classroom CONTINUOUSLY ON NON-F/N STUDENTS or queries.The whole idea is the person requiring the Method 4 Word Clearing has a Cramming Order or isnot an F/Ning student because of confusion as a result of a misunderstood word, as per Word ClearingSeries 16R or omitted materials.Method 4 fishes for the misunderstood word, finds it, clears it to F/N, looks for another in thearea until there are no more with an F/N VGIs, then moves to another area, handles that—eventuallyall the misunderstoods that resulted in the Cramming Order or non-F/N student are handled.It requires no C/S OK for it to be done.

Ask while watching the meter:“Is there any part of what you’re studying you did not fully get?”Trace the read. Use “fishing for a cog” drill (per HCO B 25 June 70, Issue III) if needed.If no read the question may be varied, e.g.“Is there any part of the materials you’re studying you disagree with?”or“Is there any part of what you’re studying you feel you could not apply?”or“In (material being checked) is there anything you didn’t understand?”Let the student tell you briefly. Do NOT tell him the data.Verify that his study pack is complete as the data might have been omitted.Also he might never have read the pack at all.450"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"If the data was missing do not go on to Step 3.

All thetools of Study Tech and Word Clearing are at the Word Clearer’s disposal to take the word toF/N. The Word Clearer does not stop at one misunderstood but makes sure all are cleared.4. Repeat 2 & 3 until the materials are fully cleared up and any and all misunderstoods orconfusions handled.5. If the action bogs when used in the classroom the student must be sent to Qual for handling andSupervisor to Cramming on TRs and metering and drilling on this procedure.The correct action is a W/C CORRECTION LIST DONE ON THE STUDENT ANDHANDLED.Of course if the above question F/Ns on asking, there would be no misunderstoods on thematerial being checked, but the person is in Cramming, not an F/Ning student or whatever, so thereobviously are misunderstood words to be found and handled.Look at HCO PL 16 Feb 72, “The Purpose of the Dept of Personnel Enhancement”. It says thisDept “reaches and looks for business all over the org and brings it in”. So someone with stats down—student or post stats, confusion about what to do, overloaded, can’t seem to handle it, how do you dothis, etc, etc, are all indicators of misunderstood words as the person is saying confusion, confusion.Well, underneath the confusion is a misunderstood word just as Word Clearing 1 6R says.Method 4 Word Clearing is what is used in doing and achieving the purpose of the Dept ofPersonnel Enhancement, HCO PL 16 Feb 72.One of the ways the Word Clearers in this Dept do the job is using Method 4 Word Clearing.METHOD 4 IS USED BY COURSE SUPERVISORS TO HANDLE ALL STUDENTQUERIES ABOUT CONTENTS OF COURSE MATERIALS.The reason students ask questions about “What is meant” is because of omitted pack materialsfrom their checksheet, failure to read what they have OR BECAUSE OF A MISUNDERSTOODWORD JUST BEFORE THEY GOT CONFUSED.The Super has to know only where the materials are and BE SMART ENOUGH TO DOMETHOD 4 INSTEAD OF GIVING THE STUDENT ALTER-ISED ANSWERS THAT STOPSCIENTOLOGY WORKING.Word Clearing, especially Method 4, is how to get in HIGH CRIME HCO PL 7 Feb 1965,Reissued 15 June 70, “KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING”.SUCCESSFUL COURSE SUPERVISION AND SUCCESSFUL CRAMMING REQUIRETHIS ACTION BE FULLY KNOWN AND U—S—E—D.**K * E * E * P****S * C * I * E * N * T * O * L * O * G * Y****W * O * R * K * I * N * G**LRH: clb.nt.rdL.

The Word Clearer makes a list of the KEY (or most important) words relating to theperson’s duties or post or the new subject.This is made up as a list. The Word Clearer looks up each word in the dictionary and writesdown the definitions.The list may have as few as three words or as many as twenty or thirty.(Example: A bank clerk’s key words would be “bank” “clerk” “money” “cash” “drafts” “teller”“accounts” “customer” etc.)(Example: There has just been a goof resulting in an upset. The goof centered around “radio”“repairs” “operation” “operator” “electronics” etc.)2. The Word Clearer, without showing the person the definitions, asks him to define eachword.3. The Word Clearer checks the definition on his list for general correctness not word forword but meaning.4. Any slow or hesitancy or misdefinition is met with having the person look the word upand look up any word in the definition the person does not have a grasp of.5. One completes his list.6. By then the person has been jarred into looking further by the above actions. The WordClearer asks “What other word relating to your post (or subject or error) didn’t you understand?”7. Each one mentioned is now defined by looking it up.8. The person can now be Method 4ed relating to his post to be sure all is clean and there areno upsets.Note: Where the person has just had an accident or ethics action it may be necessary to delay theaction until the person is calmer or not so upset as the action can be a heavy distraction if the person ishurt or frightened and will not be successful.IT WILL BE FOUND THAT LAZINESS, INACTIVITY, SLOWNESS AND ERRORS ON APOST OR IN USING A SUBJECT TRACE TO MISUNDERSTOOD KEY WORDS.THE REMEDY IS WC METHOD 6.LRH:nt.rdL.

It is done without a meter.It is used on such persons before other methods in order to get the personuntangled.If a person does not seem to be progressing by studying silently, one has him readaloud.Another copy of the same text must also be followed by the Word Clearer as theperson reads.Startling things can be observed.The person may omit the word “is” whenever it occurs. The person doesn’t read it.He may have some strange meaning for it like “Israel” (actual occurrence).He may omit “didn’t” each time it occurs and the reason traced to not knowingwhat the apostrophe is (actual occurrence).He may call one word quite another word such as “stop” for “happen” or“green” for “mean”.He may hesitate over certain words.The procedure is1. Have him read aloud.2. Note each omission or word change or hesitation or frown as he reads andtake it up at once.3. Correct it by looking it up for him or explaining it to him.4. Have him go on reading, noting the next omission, word change or hesitationor frown.5. Repeat steps 2 to 4.By doing this a person can be brought up to literacy.His next actions would be learning how to use a dictionary and look up words.Then a simple grammar.A very backward student can be boosted up to literacy by this method.LRH: nt.rd L.

(It is not a complete Dictionary and would require anotherlarger dictionary for full word clearing. But it gives American usages of words andphrases, which could be important as Dianetics and Scientology are written in AmericanEnglish.)It was sent to me by an SHSBC Student who found its definition of Grammarwas very helpful to other students.This definition also tells you why some college or school texts are so ghastly hardto read—they are not in standard English. It also tells you why, in 1950, the head ofthe English Department in an American University hailed Dianetics: The ModernScience of Mental Health as marking a new era of scientific writing. One reason is thatit was written by a writer, not a professor. The other was that it was written in theEnglish that was in use.But read the definition:GRAMMARGRAMMAR is a systematic description of the ways in which words are used in aparticular language. The grammarian groups words that behave similarly into classesand then draws up rules stating how each class of words behaves. What classes are setup and how the rules are phrased is a matter of convenience. A grammarian is free toclassify his material in any way that seems reasonable to him. But he is never free tosay that certain forms of speech are unacceptable merely because there is no place forthem in the system he has designed.THE CLASSESMost grammarians are interested in a number of languages. As a rule they set upclasses that are useful in handling many languages but that may have very little meaningfor a particular language. For example, the distinction between the dative him and theaccusative him is important in the Indo-European languages generally. But in agrammar designed solely to teach English, this distinction does not have to be made.Similarly, there is an etymological or historical difference between the English gerundin -ing and the participle in -ing. But it is sometimes impossible to say whether a givenword is a gerund or a participle; for example, in journeys end in lovers meeting. Forthis reason, some grammarians prefer to handle these forms together under one name,such as “participle” or “-ing”.The familiar terms of classical grammar are defined in this dictionary for theconvenience of persons who need to use these concepts. But a much simplerclassification, based on the structure of present-day English, is employed in all thediscussions of usage.THE RULES468"},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"In order to say how words are used, the grammarian must examine largequantities of spoken and written English. He will find some constructions used soconsistently that the exceptions have to be classed as errors. But he will also findcompeting, and even contradictory, constructions, which appear too often to be calledmistakes. He must then see whether one of these expressions is used by one kind ofperson and not by another or in one kind of situation and not in another. If he can findno difference of this sort he accepts the two constructions as interchangeable. In thisway he assembles a body of information on how English words are used that may alsoshow differences, such as those between one locality and another, or between spokenand written English, or between literary and illiterate speech. Studies of this kind arecalled “scientific” or “descriptive” grammars. This is a relatively new approach to theproblems of language and the information brought to light in this way is sometimessurprising.The first English grammarians, writing in the seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies, did not attempt to describe the English of their day. On the contrary, theywere attempting to “improve” English and they demanded Latin constructions whichwere not characteristic of English. They objected to the expression I am mistaken,because if translated into Latin this would mean I am misunderstood. They claimed thatunloose must mean tie, because un is a Latin negative. They objected to the “doublenegative” which was good Old English, and also good Greek, but not good Latin.These eighteenth century rules of prescriptive grammar have been repeated inschool books for two hundred years. They are the rules for a curious, Latinized Englishthat has never been spoken and is seldom used in literature, but that is now highlyrespected in some places, principally in scientific writing. It should be recognized thatthese rules were not designed to “preserve” English, or keep it “pure”. They weredesigned to create a language which would be “better” simply because it was more likeLatin. Dryden, writing in the seventeenth century, said: “I am often put to a stand inconsidering whether what I write be the idiom of the tongue or false grammar andnonsense, couched beneath that specious name of Anglicism, and have no other way toclear my doubts but by translating my English into Latin and thereby trying what sensethe words will bear in a more stable language.” One result of this double translationwas that Dryden went through his earlier works and rewrote all the sentences that hadoriginally ended in a preposition or adverb. A generation later, Swift complained thatthe English of his day “offends against every part of grammar”. Certainly this isblaming the foot because it doesn’t fit the shoe!Because some people would like to write the language of the textbooks, theentries in this dictionary not only tell what standing a given construction has in currentEnglish but also explain how the rules of the prescriptive grammarian would apply,wherever the rules and standard practice differ. But in such cases the rules are neversimple, and the person who has to use this type of English may feel that it would beeasier to follow Dryden’s example and write in Latin first.THIS BOOKThe grammar entries in this book are designed for persons who speak standardEnglish but who may be confused about certain isolated points. The entries arearranged so that the answer to a particular problem can be found in the least possibletime. But anyone who wishes to make a systematic study of English grammar, usingthis book, can do so by starting with the entry parts of speech and following thereferences to more and more detailed discussions of each concept.

Their training was for a sophisticated environment.The country of the program is just emerging from a nomadic level civilization intoagricultural and the agriculture done is extremely primitive, erodes whole plains withnon-contour plowing and doesn’t even know about irrigation.To these people they taught the highly complex technology of the electronic age!The people went back home, found no computers whatever, listened to the goatsand sat down and did nothing.U.S. AID had no explanation for this. But give them credit—the students likedthe U.S. and U.S. AID did honestly survey and admit the failure, a rare humility.From this point I did a local study and found that instead of computers thesepeople needed—guess what?TR 2! Acknowledgement. (Training Drill No. 2, How to Acknowledge aCommunication.)This primitive area had never heard of TR 2!“Good”, “fine”, “thank you” were unknown in all their work culture.Before they saw any need of any technology, they had first to see that there wasany reason to get any work done at all!Further, their cultural pattern contained dishonesty as a virtue! This is antipatheticto basic morale no matter what the culture and so they were in a cultural attitude orpattern which kept them sad, depressed and miserable! So they couldn’t work.The program, then, had to (a) recover honesty to increase morale, (b) introduceacknowledgement for accomplishment, (c) establish the possibility that one couldwork, (d) introduce statistics so that something existed that could be acknowledged and(e) establish bonuses for statistics so that acknowledgement could be real and stay thatway.These items are all very elementary and simple portions of our basic technology:470"},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"(a) Security checking, (b) TRs especially 2, (c) Problems of Work Course using tapeand Word Clearing, (d) Statistical policies and tech, (e) Bonus policies.So in U.S. AID Programs there was a skipped gradient in culture (nomad-agrarian skipped to electronic-nuclear) and a skipped gradient in training—Why learnwhen there is no reason to work? So why be literate? Or study?Any sophisticated technical layout would break down in the hands of thesepeople—and does.But this program would lift them up. Then they would have some reason tostudy.Factually, one cannot just sail into a culture blind and bash around with no data.

Student or staff member is sent to Pc Examiner for F/N VGIs check. If noF/N VGIs, student or staff member returns to Word Clearer to complete toF/N VGIs or WCCL, if required.6. The text is now restudied by the student or staff member.Method 9 can be used before or after the fact of a flub. For example, any upperlevel C/S to get an OK to C/S should M9 the C/S Series, restudy and starrate and do inclay as a basic action in Qual. Or an Auditor who is flubbing on Assessment gets M9on the Assessment pack. Or a Supervisor who is flubby gets M9 on key MCSCmaterials. In each case, the materials word cleared must be restudied and starrated.Word Clearers must be specifically and extensively drilled to do M9 (or M7) sothat they can read a text and pick up any and all physical manifestations at the sametime. Only then is an OK to do M9 (or M7) issued.473"},{"pageNumber":505,"pageContent":"The fact of having had material word cleared using a different method does notprevent M9 being used.

Word Clearing canbecome lengthy until Method One is completed.Some people have severe difficulty with all forms of Word Clearing until a fulland complete M1 with additional applicable subjects added and fully handled. Thesymptom of a person requiring M1 or M1 Expanded would be approaching all forms ofWord Clearing on a “subject” basis and handling chains on each word approached.This makes these shorter forms of Word Clearing very lengthy. This can happen on thePRD causing a bogged or very slow student. He can be cleaned up with a WCCL inQual followed by a completed Method One. If this doesn’t handle it, the student needsadditional correction or the Primary Correction Rundown. Everyone runs better on allforms of Word Clearing when Method One is fully completed. Others may require afull Primary Correction Rundown before they can easily tackle day to day WordClearing, as is required in any Org.In some rare cases, there may be a misunderstood symbol in the alphabet itself.M7, as the major undercut Word Clearing process, may require an undercut, by a directaddress to the alphabet. This can easily be done by getting the person to rattle off thealphabet and handling it itself with M7, handling all letters on which a person hasdifficulty, can’t remember, stumbles on, etc, until the person can rattle them all offwithout hesitation. The full New World Dictionary contains a section at the beginningof each letter, which may be of assistance in cleaning up the alphabet.INTERRELATED USES OFWORD CLEARINGAll forms of Word Clearing can be utilized to get a result. The fact of using oneform does not mean that another will not locate more misunderstoods.For example, a staff member could have M7 Word Clearing to improve hisreading to an EP, then have M6 on the key words of his post, then M7 the one or twokey PLs of his post, then study them and have a final M4 check before starrating.Don’t drop out M2 as one of the effective forms of Word Clearing. It has aspecialized use on whole texts of materials or tapes. The clearing of first or earliermaterials plays a key factor in unlocking some PT study problems or situations.

If the person speaks severallanguages, or lived in several countries, the languages would be handled in the sequence they wereencountered.To do Method One in English on a French person without first doing M1 in French is more orless a waste of time. The person won’t make it in English until the earlier misunderstoods connectedwith the earlier language are fully handled.When Word Clearing a person who speaks a foreign language, it is imperative to have a properdictionary in that language to hand. Do not use the English/French or English/German “dictionary” forit is not a dictionary but a reference manual only and does not contain full and proper definitions.The most charged language(s) will be that first learned and that used in school.Obviously, it is best for a foreign language person to be audited on M1 by an Auditor whospeaks the same language. However, if one was not available, it could be done by writing up the M1list phonetically in the language concerned and running a standard M1, making sure that the Pc keepsthe Auditor very well informed on the definitions in the dictionary.Foreign language students on Courses are usually provided with translated tape courses. In thiscase, the full technology on handling tape courses and their repair must be fully applied. M2 and 4 ontapes must be set up for immediate handling in Tech and Qual.It could be also that a foreign language student cannot read English because of unhandledproblems on reading his own language and so would greatly benefit from an M7 on a reading text inhis own language.If a foreign language student is studying an English text, he must have an English and theforeign language dictionary to hand, so that if he runs into difficulty on the English definition, he cancheck up on the foreign language definition difficulty, straighten that one, then handle the Englishdefinition.We can get any student, Pc or staff member through IF we fully use all forms ofWord Clearing fully.Ens.

Example: TheM4 Word Clearer in Qual says, “Look at definition No. 5.” The Student does and getsit but later has trouble with the same word or HCO B due to incompletely definedwords. Example: The PCRD Student who looks up words until she’s “got theconcept”, incompletely defines half the words on the PCRD and utterly defeats itspurpose, and hers.PROCEDUREIn clearing words the Student looks up every definition, using each meaning ofthe word in sentences until he’s got it. When all definitions have been cleared, thecontext of the sentence the word was found in is consulted and the Student chooses thedefinition that applies and ensures he understands it. At this point the word has beencleared, and not before.PRDThis procedure applies especially to the PRD where the context is unknown.

Any misduplicationon the part of the translator will result in mistranslations which will cause greatconfusion to the eventual student.When word clearing a translator, it will normally be found that his basicmisunderstood will be from the time he started to learn the language. Something is veryfunny about learning foreign languages; it won’t be the foreign language the persondoesn’t understand. It will be the grammatical terms in their own language used to learnthe foreign language.You could spend days, for example, working with a person who can’t seem tolearn French; and then all of a sudden find out it wasn’t a French word he was havingtrouble with at all—it was “Subjunctive mode” or something of that sort.This works the same way for another language back into English.A word clearer could go on forever working with a person having difficulty withEnglish if he didn’t know this one question:1. “What word in your own language that described how you spoke English didn’tyou understand?”This question is asked off the meter. The word clearer accepts whatever answerthe translator gives.2. The word clearer has the translator look up the words found in 1 above in asimple grammar book in his own language. There may be one or two words, orthere may be many. The word clearer gets them all thoroughly looked up andfully understood by the translator.3. If the translator cannot find an answer to the question, yet is having difficulty, theword clearer should realize that there are words—unseen—misunderstood. Havethe translator go through a simple book in his own language that teaches English,looking up every word he is the least bit unsure of. Have him do this until he isno longer having difficulty.480"},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"The above steps can be done for any languages the translator may speak inaddition to English, if he is multilingual.

The endless Semantic circles pursued by Korzybski and company (seeData Series 1, “The Anatomy of Thought”) never really led to the realization that a wordand its meanings are embodied in the basic concept or idea symbolized by that word.That conceptualization of meanings is foreign to dictionary writers and “experts”is evidenced by the fact that definitions are so subject to alter-is and change with thepassage of time.485"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"For example, modern definitions of the word “understand” are found to be largelyinadequate. A really full and meaningful definition of it could only be found in a FirstEdition of Webster’s Dictionary of Synonyms, 1942:“Understand. To have a clear and true idea or conception, or fulland exact knowledge, of something. In general it may be saidthat understand refers to the result of a mental process orprocesses (a clear and exact idea or notion, or full knowledge).Understand implies the power to receive and register a clear andtrue impression.”CLEARED WORDSOperating within a society steeped in misunderstood words and mis-definitions,Study Tech is subject to arbitraries. Thus, a CLEARED WORD is defined as follows:A WORD WHICH HAS BEEN CLEARED TO THE POINTOF FULL CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING.In Metered Word Clearing this translates as:F/N, VGIs.There are many ways and combinations to achieve this EP.

What is Art? is one of the least answered of human questions.Art abounds with authorities. It was chosen because “that field containing themost authorities contains the least codified knowledge”. The obvious invitation is toanswer the question and codify the subject. This has now been done.The subject was originally brought up in a conversation with Donald H. Rogers at42 Aberdeen Road, Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1950.As this zone of human activity seemed to stand outside the field of Dianetics andScientology, I thereafter worked with it on a casual basis.Having published 15,000,000 words between 1929 and 1941, I was notunacquainted with the arts. Since 1950 I have worked with other arts than that ofliterature in order to make an advance on the general subject of ART.I have made a breakthrough at last in this matter. And I find it is applicable towhat we are doing and therefore also has practical value.To make it a matter of record rather than a filed sheaf of notes, I am publishingthese findings as an HCO B. I also feel they will be of some assistance in forwardingScientology.As in the case of all “pure research” (by which is meant study without thought ofpossible application) there is a sudden pay-off in these answers including the betterdissemination of Scientology and the rehabilitation of the artist.My incidental studies in the fields of photography and music materially assistedthese discoveries.Approaching the state of Clear has also assisted in comprehending this rather vastsubject of ART. It is adventurous to state one has solved such a sweeping subject buthere at least are the fundamentals and basics.The following are rough notes but are in fact the basis of that branch of activitywe call ART.THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ARTBASIC DEFINITIONART is a word which summarizes THE QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION.It therefore follows the laws of communication.489"},{"pageNumber":521,"pageContent":"Too much originality throws the audience into unfamiliarity and thereforedisagreement, as communication contains duplication and “originality” is the foe ofduplication.TECHNIQUE should not rise above the level of workability for the purpose ofcommunication.PERFECTION cannot be attained at the expense of communication.Seeking perfection is a wrong target in art. One should primarily seekcommunication with it and then perfect it as far as reasonable. One attemptscommunication within the framework of applicable skill. If perfection greater than thatwhich can be attained for communication is sought, one will not communicate.Example: A camera that shoots perfectly but is not mobile enough to get pictures.One must settle for the highest level of technical perfection obtainable below the abilityto obtain the picture.The order of importance in art is:1. The resultant communication,2. The technical rendition.2 is always subordinate to 1. 2 may be as high as possible but never so high as toinjure 1.The communication is the primary target. The technical quality of it is thesecondary consideration. A person pushes 2 as high as possible within the reality of 1.A being can take a lot of trouble with 2 to achieve 1 but there is a point whereattempting 2 prevents 1.If the ardures of 2 prevent 1, then modify 2, don’t modify 1.Perfection is defined as the quality obtainable which still permits the delivery ofthe communication.Too much time on 2 of course prevents 1.It is usually necessary to lower a standard from absolute perfection to achievecommunication. The test of the artist is how little it is lowered not how high it ispushed.A professional in the arts is one who obtains communication with the art form atthe minimum sacrifice of technical quality. There is always some sacrifice of quality tocommunicate at all.The reduction of mass or time or impedimenta or facilities toward the ability torender a result is the exact measurement of how much technical perfection can beattempted. The rule is if one is being too perfectionistic to actually achieve acommunication, reduce the mass, time, impedimenta or facilities sufficiently low toaccomplish the communication but maintain the technique and perfection as high as isreconcilable with the result to be achieved and within one’s power to act.No communication is no art. To not do the communication for lack of technicalperfection is the primary error. It is also an error not to push up the technical aspects ofthe result as high as possible.One measures the degree of perfection to be achieved by the degree ofcommunication that will be accomplished.490"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"This is seen even in a workman and tools. The workman who cannot accomplishanything but must have tools is an artistic failure.“Art for art’s sake” is a complete paradox as a remark. “Art for the sake ofcommunication” and “Attempted perfection without communicating” are the plus andminus of it all.One can of course communicate to oneself if one wishes to be both cause andeffect.One studies art only if one wishes to communicate and the search for artisticperfection is the result of past failures to communicate.Self-improvement is based entirely on earlier lack of communicating.Living itself can be an art.The search for freedom is either the retreat from past failures to communicate orthe effort to attain new communication. To that degree then the search for freedom is asick or well impulse.Searching for and discovering one’s past failures to communicate an art form oridea about it will therefore inevitably rehabilitate the artist.However, due to the nature of the Reactive Mind, full rehabilitation is achievedonly through releasing and clearing.How much art is enough art? The amount necessary to produce an approximationof the desired effect on its receiver or beholder, within the reality of the possibility ofdoing so.A concept of the beholder and some understanding of his or her acceptance levelis necessary to the formulation of a successful art form or presentation. This includesan approximation of what is familiar to him and is associated with the desired effect.All Art depends for its success upon the former experience and associations of thebeholder. There is no pure general form since it must assume a sweeping generality offormer experiences in the beholder.Artists all, to a greater or lesser degree, need comprehension of the minds andviewpoints of others in order to have their work accepted; since the acceptability of acommunication depends upon the mental composition of the receiver. Scientology thenis a must for any artist if he would succeed without heartbreak.In any art form or activity one must conceive of the beholder (if only himself). Tofail to do so is to invite disappointment and eventual dissatisfaction with one’s owncreations.An artist who disagrees thoroughly with the “taste” of his potential audiencecannot of course communicate with that audience easily. His disagreement is actuallynot based on the audience but on former inabilities to communicate with such audiencesor rejections by a vaguely similar audience.The lack of desire to communicate with an art form may stem from an entirelydifferent inability than the one supposed to exist.Professionals often get into such disputes on how to present the art form that theentirety becomes a technology, not an art, and, lacking progress and newness ofacceptance, dies. This is probably the genus of all decline or vanishment of art forms. The idea of contemporary communication is lost. All old forms become beset bytechnical musts and must nots and so cease to communicate. The art is the form that491"},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"communicates not the technology of how, the last contributing to the ease of creatingthe effect and preservation of the steps used in doing it. A form’s reach, blunted,becomes involved with the perfection alone, and ceases to be an art form in its properdefinition.A communication can be blunted by suppressing its art form: Example, bad tapereproduction, scratched film, releasing bits not authorized. This then is the primarysuppression.On the other hand, failing continuously to permit a non-destructivecommunication on the grounds of its lack of art is also suppressive.Between these two extremes there is communication and the task is to attain thehighest art form possible that can be maintained in the act of communicating. To dootherwise is inartistic and objectionable.These, therefore, are the fundamentals of ART.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:Ml jhCopyright © 1965by L.

Verily,you say, you have just asked a question for which there are no answers except thesneers and applause of critics. Indeed, this is why we have art critics! For who can tellhow good good is. Who knows?I have a surprise for you. There IS an answer.As you know, I searched for many years, as a sort of minor counterpoint to whatI was hardwork doing, to dredge up some of the materials which might constitute thebasis of art. Art was the most uncodified and most opinionated subject on the planetafter men’s ideas about women and women’s ideas about men and Man’s ideas of Man.Art was anyone’s guess. Masterpieces have gone unapplauded, positive freaks havegained raves.So how good does a work of art have to be to be good?The painter will point out all the tiny technical details known only to painters, themusician will put a score through the Alto horn and explain about valve clicks and lip,the poet will talk about meter types, the actor will explain how the position and wave ofone hand per the instructions of one school can transform a clod into an actor. And so itgoes, art by art. bit by bit.But all these people will be discussing the special intricacies and holy mysteries oftechnique, the tiny things only the initiate of that art would recognize. They are talkingabout technique. They are not really answering how good a work of art has to be.Works of art are viewed by people. They are heard by people. They are felt bypeople. They are not just the fodder of a close-knit group of initiates. They are the soulfood of all people.One is at liberty of course to challenge that wide purpose of art. Some professorswho don’t want rivals tell their students “Art is for self-satisfaction” “It is a hobby.” Inother words, don’t display or exhibit, kid, or you’ll be competition! The world today isfull of that figure-figure. But as none of this self-satisfaction art meets a definition of artwider than self for the sake of self, the professional is not interested in it.In any artistic production, what does one have as an audience? People. Not,heaven forbid, critics. But people. Not experts in that line of art. But people.That old Chinese poet who, after he wrote a poem, went down out of histraditional garret and read it to the flower-selling old lady on the corner had the rightidea. If she understood it and thought it was great, he published. If she didn’t he put itin the bamboo trash can. Not remarkably, his poems have come down the centuriesawesomely praised.493"},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"Well, one could answer this now by just saying that art should communicate topeople high and low. But that really doesn’t get the sweating professional anywhere asa guide in actually putting together a piece of work and it doesn’t give him a yardstickwhereby he can say “That is that!” “I’ve done it.” And go out with confidence that hehas.What is technique? What is its value? Where does it fit? What is perfectionism?Where does one stop scraping off the paint and erasing notes and say “That is that”?For there is a point. Some artists don’t ever find it. The Impressionists practicallyspun in as a group trying to develop a new way of viewing and communicating it. Theymade it—or some of them did like Monet. But many of them never knew where to stopand they didn’t make it. They couldn’t answer the question “How good does a piece ofart work have to be to be good?”In this time of century, there are many communication lines for works of art.Because a few works of art can be shown so easily to so many there may even be fewerartists. The competition is very keen and even dagger sharp. To be good one has to bevery good. But in what way and how?Well, when I used to buy breakfasts for Greenwich Village artists (which they atehungrily, only stopping between bites to deplore my commercialism and bastardizingmy talents for the gold that bought their breakfasts) I used to ask this question andneedless to say I received an appalling variety of responses. They avalanched me withtechnique or lack of it, they vaguely dwelt on inherent talent, they rushed me around togalleries to show me Picasso or to a board fence covered with abstracts. But none ofthem told me how good a song had to be to be a song.So I wondered about this. And a clue came when the late Hubert Mathieu, a dearfriend, stamped with youth on the Left Bank of the Seine and painting dowagers at theBeaux Arts in middle age, said to me “To do any of these modern, abstract, cubistthings, you have to first be able to paint!” And he enlarged the theme while I plied himin the midnight hush of Manhattan with iced sherry and he finished up the First Lady ofNantucket’s somewhat swollen ball gown. Matty could PAINT. Finally he dashed meoff an abstract to show me how somebody who couldn’t paint would do it and how itcould be done.I got his point. To really make one of these too too modern things come off, youfirst had to be able to paint. So I said well, hell, there’s Gertrude Stein and ThomasMann and ink splatterers like those. Let’s see if it really is an art form. So I sharpenedup my electric typewriter and dashed off the last chapters of a novel in way far out acidprose and put THE END at the bottom and shipped it off to an editor who promptlypushed several large loaves down the telephone wire and had me to lunch and unlikehis normal blase self said, “I really got a big bang (this was decades ago, other years,other slang) out of the way that story wound up! You really put it over the plate.” Andit sent his circulation rating up. And this was very odd because you see the firstchapters were straight since they’d been written before Matty got thirsty for sherry andcalled me to come over and the last chapters were an impressionistic stream ofconsciousness that Mann himself would have called “an advanced rather adventurousover-Finneganized departure from the ultra school.”So just to see how far this sort of thing could go, for a short while I shiftedaround amongst various prose periods just to see what was going on. That they solddidn’t prove too much because I never had any trouble with that. But that they wereunderstood at all was surprising to me for their prose types (ranging from Shakespeareto Beowulf) were at wild variance with anything currently being published.So I showed them to Matty the next time he had a ball gown to do or three chinsto paint out and was thirsty. And he looked them over and he said, “Well, you provedmy point. There’s no mystery to it. Basically you’re a trained writer! It showsthrough.”494"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"And now we are getting somewhere, not just with me and my adventures andlong dead yesterdays.As time rolled on, this is what I began to see: The fellow technician in an art hearsand sees the small technical points. The artist himself is engrossed in the exactapplication of certain exact actions which produce, when done, his canvas, his score,his novel, his performance.The successful artist does these small things so well that he also then has attentionand skill left to get out his message, he is not still fiddling about with the cerulean blueand the semiquaver. He has these zeroed in. He can repeat them and repeat them astechnical actions. No ulcers. Strictly routine.And here we have three surrealist paintings. And they each have their ownmessage. And the public wanders by and they only look with awe on one. And why isthis one different than the other two? Is it a different message? No. Is it more popular?That’s too vague.If you look at or listen to any work of art, there is only one thing the casualaudience responds to en masse, and if this has it then you too will see it as a work ofart. If it doesn’t have it, you won’t.So what is it?TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ITSELF ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE ANEMOTIONAL IMPACT.And that is how good a work of art has to be to be good.If you look this over from various sides, you will see that the general spectator isgenerally unaware of technique. That is the zone of art’s creators.Were you to watch a crowd watching a magician, you would find one commondenominator eliciting uniform response. If he is a good magician he is a smoothshowman. He isn’t showing them how he does his tricks. He is showing them aflawless flowing performance. This alone is providing the carrier wave that takes thesubstance of his actions to his audience. Though a far cry from fine art, perhaps, yetthere is art in the way he does things. If he is good, the audience is seeing first of all,before anything else, the TECHNICAL EXPERTISE of his performance. They are alsowatching him do things they know they can’t do. And they are watching the outcome ofhis presentations. He is a good magician if he gives a technically flawless performancejust in terms of scenes and motions which provide the channel for what he ispresenting.Not to compare Bach with a magician (though you could), all great pieces of arthave this one factor in common. First of all, before one looks at the faces on the canvasor hears the meaning of the song, there is the TECHNICAL EXPERTISE thereadequate to produce an emotional impact. Before one adds message or meaning, thereis this TECHNICAL EXPERTISE.TECHNICAL EXPERTISE is composed of all the little and large bits oftechnique known to the skilled painter, musician, actor, any artist. He adds these thingstogether in his basic presentation. He knows what he is doing. And how to do it. Andthen to this he adds his message.All old masters were in there nailing canvas on frames as apprentices or grindingup the lapis lazuli or cleaning paintbrushes before they arrived at the Metropolitan.But how many paintbrushes do you have to clean? Enough to know that cleanpaintbrushes make clean color. How many clarinet reeds do you have to replace?Enough to know which types will hit high C.495"},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Back of every artist there is technique. You see them groping, finding,discarding, fooling about. What are they hunting for? A new blue? No, just a constantof blue that is an adequate quality.And you see somebody who can really paint still stumbling about looking fortechnique—a total overrun.Someplace one says, “That’s the TECHNICAL EXPERTISE adequate to producean emotional impact.” And that’s it. Now he CAN. So he devotes himself to messages.If you get this tangled up or backwards, the art does not have a good chance ofbeing good. If one bats out messages without a TECHNICALLY EXPERT carrierwave of art, the first standard of the many spectators seems to be violated.The nice trick is to be a technician and retain one’s fire. Then one can whip outthe masterpieces like chain lightning. And all the great artists seem to have managedthat. And when they forked off onto a new trail they mastered the technique and thenerupted with great works.It is a remarkable thing about expertise. Do you know that some artists get by on“Technical expertise adequate to produce an emotional impact” alone with no messages?They might not suspect that. But it is true.So the “expertise adequate” is important enough to be itself art. It is never greatart. But it produces an emotional impact just from quality alone.And how masterly an expertise? Not very masterly. Merely adequate. Howadequate is adequate? Well, people have been known to criticize a story because therewere typographical errors in the typing. And stories by the non-adept often go pagesbefore anyone appears or anything happens. And scores have been known to beconsidered dull simply because they were inexpertly chorded or clashed. And ahandsome actor has been known not to have made it because he never knew what to dowith his arms, for all his fiery thunderings of the Bard’s words.Any art demands a certain expertise. When this is basically sound, magic! Almostanyone will look at it and say Ah! For quality alone has an emotional impact. That it iscubist or dissonant or blank verse has very little bearing on it; the type of the art form isno limitation to audience attention generally when it has, underlying it and expressed init, the expertise adequate to produce an emotional impact.The message is what the audience thinks it sees or hears. The significance of theplay, the towering clouds of sound in the symphony, the scatter-batter of the currentpop group, are what the audience thinks it is perceiving and what they will describe,usually, or which they think they admire. If it comes to them with a basic expertiseitself able to produce an emotional impact they will think it is great. And it will be great.The artist is thought of as enthroned in some special heaven where all is clean andthere is no sweat, eyes half closed in the thrall of inspiration. Well maybe he issometimes. But every one I’ve seen had ink in his hair or a towel handy to mop hisbrow or a throat spray in his hand to ease the voice strain of having said his linestwenty-two times to the wall or the cat. I mean the great ones. The others were loafingand hoping and talking about the producer or the unfair art gallery proprietor.The great ones always worked to achieve the technical quality necessary. Whenthey had it they knew they had it. How did they know? Because it was technicallycorrect.Living itself is an art form. One puts up a mock-up. It doesn’t happen byaccident. One has to know how to wash his nylon shirts and girls have to know whatmascara runs and that too many candy bars spoil the silhouette, quite in addition to thepancreas.496"},{"pageNumber":528,"pageContent":"Some people are themselves a work of art because they have mastered the smallpractical techniques of living that give them a quality adequate to produce an emotionalimpact even before anyone knows their name or what they do.Even a beard and baggy pants require a certain art if they are to be the expertiseadequate to produce an emotional impact.And some products produce a bad misemotional impact without fully beingviewed. And by this reverse logic, of which you can think of many examples such as adirty room, you can then see that there might be an opposite expertise, all by itself,adequate to produce a strong but desirable emotional impact.That is how good a work of art has to be. Once one is capable of executing thattechnical expertise for that art form he can pour on the message. Unless theprofessional form is there first, the message will not transmit.A lot of artists are overstraining to obtain a quality far above that necessary toproduce an emotional impact. And many more are trying to machine gun messages atthe world without any expertise at all to form the vital carrier wave.So how good does a piece of art have to be?  L.

The performer purpose is basically Communication.(a) To Communicate one must have R (Reality)—which is to say one must bevisible.(b) To Communicate one must have R that there is an audience there to beCommunicated to.(c) A degree of Affinity with or for the audience must be physically expressed.(One cannot treat an audience with contempt, for instance.) (A perpetualsmile is not a must, a respectful look, a friendly look does as well.)If you look over the above ABCs you will see that the general basic of StageManners is the ARC Triangle. From this almost anything else can be derived.However, there are some traditional rules.I. You accept applause. This is the contribution of the audience. You do notcut it off. You acknowledge it with bows or other physical actions. But youaccept it. You don’t dodge it.II. You never turn your back on the audience. (An exception is an actor in playstage situations.) You turn in such a way as to turn facing the audience. Youdo not turn the other way around and so give them your back.III. Never express embarrassment or stage fright even when you feel it. Forceyourself into a physical appearance and expression of poise.IV. If you goof, ride right over it. Do not break off, call attention to it or lookhelpless or foolish. Just ride right over it and go on.V. If you do not know what to do with your hands or feet, don’t do anythingwith them. Avoid twisting your feet or legs or hands or arms around. Don’tfiddle with things. Be positive in motion.VI. During breaks or silent periods remember you are still on stage and StageManners still apply.VIIAlways appear to be in control of the place and the audience.498"},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"VIIINever let your poise be shattered by a sudden surprise. Ride over it andhandle.IX. A performer DOMINATES an audience: (a) By his comm, (b) By his art, (c) By his technical perfection,(d) By his Stage Manners.None of this means that one cannot clown, joke, act superior or even seemaustere. These are the arts of presence. But even in doing these, Stage Manners areobserved.If as a small child one was always cautioned about his manners and resented itone should get a clear idea of what manners are:In a culture manners are the lubrication that ease the frictions of social contacts.On the stage, Stage Manners are the means of smoothing the problems ofinterchange between audience and performer.The hallmark of the professional performer, next to his art and expertise, isflawless Stage Manners.Stand before a full-length mirror. (Or use Video Tape.) Assume the postures ofyour act. Accept applause gracefully. Bow gracefully. Smile pleasantly. Laugh. Bedignified. Demonstrate poise. Assume the posture needed for a non-applaudingaudience. Ride out boos. Demand more applause. Do the postures to end yourperformance after applause. Accept a standing ovation. Deplore not being able to givean encore. Appear at the start for a first part of a performance. Assume the postures andpoise needed on stage during a one minute break between numbers. Accept a plaque.Accept flowers. Ride over a bad goof. Be respectful to the audience. Kid the audienceout of it. Do each one of the IX rules. AND ALL WITHOUT SAYING A WORD. Doit with physical motions or lack of them.When you can do all these things and look right to yourself and feel easy aboutthem you will have and be confident of your Stage Manners.  L.

Rhythm denotes the regular patterned flow, the ebb and riseof sounds and movement in speech, music, writing, dance and in other physicalactivities. Meter basically means measure and applies to a system or pattern ofmeasured recurrence of length, beat or numbers in poetry or music.TYPES OF MUSICRHYTHMThere are SIX distinct types of rhythm in music. These are:REGULAR: Meaning the evenly accented (stressed) beat.SYNCOPATED: The placing of upbeats along with downbeats at regular orirregular intervals.STOPPED: In a stopped rhythm there are regular distinct halts to the flow ofmelody, but all the beats are there, they are simply regularly halted for an interval. (Theterm comes from choreography as in tap dancing where the dancer taps fill the stops.)ACCENTED: Where one or more beats in a measure received a stronger stress(beat) or accent. Accent in a rhythm can be done by volume, duration, pitch or tonequality (timbre).OMITTED BEAT: The regular omission of one or more beats in measures. Timemay have to be counted over two or more measures in order to regularly omit. (Soul,Motown. )ADDED BEAT: Additional strong or, generally, weak beats are added to therhythm in a consistent or inconsistent manner. (Bongos, Congas, etc.)USAGEAny and all rhythms are made up of the six basics above. One, two or more canbe employed in complex patterns.REPETITIONRhythm is rhythm because of repetition (recurrence).RAPPORTRAPPORT: Relationship, especially, one of mutual trust or affinity.An audience in rapport is different than an audience of spectators.An audience in rapport PARTICIPATES in small or large ways with theperformer or the artist or work of art, often by vocal or body motion.500"},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"Such participation is achieved by:1. Reliance on the even recurrence of the rhythm.2. Ability to predict it will recur.3. Formation of agreement by such reliable prediction.4. Permitting the audience to fill gaps or significances. Regular omission of abeat or step or full explanation causes the audience to fill it for themselvesand brings about physical or mental participation.RHYTHMAll life is a repeating pulse and ebb and surge of motion.Life becomes difficult when rhythmic prediction cannot occur. Anxiety sets in. Itis a relief to participate in predictable rhythm in an art form. It is safe and reassuring. Ifthe rhythm is exciting it is also exciting. Therefore participation in predictable rhythm ispleasure and even joy.IMPINGEMENTWhen one changes rhythm within a single work one “makes wrong” because theperson has predicted the rhythm but the prediction is not met. Thus he is wrong. If therhythm recurs, the person is made right.A new rhythm attracts attention. If it is agreed with and recurs it getsparticipation.ART FORMSThe above materials, while written from the viewpoint of music, apply to any artform.Even prose has a rhythm. Not all rhythms are pleasant or acceptable.Many ways exist to utilize these observations on rhythm—i.e. one can begin anunwanted rhythm, using the audience objection to impinge and then turn it into awanted rhythm.As life itself is going through time and as time is recurrence, some rhythms aretoo dull to attain any attention.Rhythm, used in art forms, must therefore slow or speed or change the expectedrhythms of ordinary life in order to command attention.Rhythm can sooth, lull, excite, arouse to any point of the emotional tone scale.A rhythm one half to one tone below the usual rhythm in life will depress ordegrade an audience.A rhythm one half to one tone above the usual rhythm will dominate and interest.Rhythm and its expression is the basic key to all art forms.LRH:ntm.rdL.

Many were writtenby others than myself.Accordingly, to correct certain outnesses and GET REAL RESULTS EVERYTIME, I gave a correct demonstration to the Medical Officers at Flag. They were alsotold by someone else it needed a Case Supervisor clearance and by another that it had tobe known by a Class IV Auditor. Both of these data were false and were cancelled.Being alerted now that students learning it do it all over a doll with no idea ofbalance, I wish to make sure the correct data is known so this tech, very powerfulwhen CORRECTLY DONE, is better understood as to exact use.I know no better way of giving the real scene than publishing these correct notesby one of the Medical Officers who took notes during the demonstration.TALK BY LRH TO FLAG MEDICAL OFFICERS ON TOUCH ASSISTS,WITH DEMONSTRATIONOn assists when you are speaking with medicos you talk to them in terms ofrestoring comm in blood and nerve channels.I’ve recently observed nobody does a correct touch assist. Hence I want to showyou how to get real results.Normal errors in a touch assist are: (1) Don’t go to extremities, (2) Don’t equalbalance to both sides, (3) Don’t carry through (they go to release point only), (4) Don’trepeat on following days if needed.A guy stubs a toe, the other toe is where it is locked up.There is a balance of the nerve energy of the body on 12 nerve channels going upand down the spine. The type of energy in the body travels at 10 ft a second.The energy from a shock will make a standing wave in the body.The brain is a shock cushion, that is all. It absorbs the shock from a large amountof energy. The neuron-synapse is a disconnection.A wave one way will have a wave reacting the other way. In the sympatheticsystem the wave locks up on both sides of the body. So do assist thoroughly on bothsides. Get both sides and unlock standing wave. The purpose of a touch assist is tounlock the standing waves that are small electronic ridges of nervous energy that is notflowing as it should.You can unlock an impulse in the leg and it can get into spine and lock up. So thisis where you get the Chiropractor fixing people. But the nerves are “telling themuscles” to hold the bone out of place.502"},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"A shock puts, via the nerves, a permanent command into a set of muscles, alldifferent “commands” going out from the shock. The system functions through stops totry to hold that shock back. It’s actually nerve to muscle to bone.Light massage along nerve channels will get muscles unlocked to permit bone togo in place. You unlock nerve channels.The trick is standing waves. The wave is slowed down as it goes through body,like at each joint. There are brain cells at each joint absorbing the shock.Inertia—when enough heavy charge goes through a nerve it stops passing thecharge through and just builds it up. A touch assist will bring the flow back and thesuspended pain, cold, electrical charges and muscle command will blow through.Shock impulse goes tearing down nerve in huge volume, all accumulatingnodules of standing waves all over body, trying to stop the nerve impulse. The nervegoes into apathy with the huge volume of impulse. Like 100,000 volts of electricityover a small wire, something goes.With auditing you are bringing back the nerve “from apathy” up through the tonescale. Like getting apathy of nerve up through the pain explosion. So the touch assist isshort sessioned and always balanced.At first you might just get an awareness of the area, then maybe after the 3rd or4th assist (third or fourth day or many more days with one done each day) there is alarge jolt that will go through.The comm cycle is not as important in the touch assist as it is with thetan auditing.But it must be present. Here we are dealing with the body. You do give the command,get an answer from the patient and acknowledge each time.THE ASSIST DEMO done on Arthur Hubbard(Arthur had a wound on his right foot right side at ball of foot location, woundnot healing quickly.)You want to get the guy where he is available. (Arthur was sitting on chair withlegs straight and feet on LRH’s knees [one foot on each knee], and Arthur’s handspalms down on his shins. Arthur was comfortable—LRH asked about his comfort.)The target of all this touch assist is the pain in the wound in the side of the foot.The extremity is the top end of the big toe. Both hands and especially finger tip are alsoextremities. It’s a sympathetic system.On the assist you must go to corresponding extremities.(R factor) I’m going to touch you like this (LRH touched Arthur’s foot). Whenyou feel it well tell me, okay? Okay.Feel my finger. Yes (Arthur). Good (LRH). This was done rapidly alternatingfrom one side of body to other, one command and answer and ack for each touch;assist done on each toe back and forth left to right, one for one touch on one side, touchon other side. Up foot, each toe, over to hands, left hand to right hand, one touch forone. This was done for several minutes.LRH then had Arthur bend over to get to the spine. Arthur said he had somenumbness in the lower spine when LRH asked about this area. LRH then did the spinetouching 3 inches from spine on one side then to three inches on the other sidealternately, up the head and around the neck and head.LRH asked, “How’s that?” Arthur said, “Better,” gave cognition on pants beingsame ones he had on during accident, and LRH ended off.503"},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"SPINEArthur during assist had numbness in kidney back area. This is the midpointbetween the extremities on the sympathetic system. In the future if the assist hadn’tbeen done he might have had kidney trouble.The impulse locks up in the spine, so you have to do the spine too to release thatcharge.EXTREMITYThe extremity is beyond the point of the body injury. Really handling theextremity furthest from the injury, the legs, would strip the blocked energy out (if youget the extremity). (During the assist LRH did not do the legs, or arms, only toes, feet,hands, fingers and back.)“The way you run the touch assist is give the commandthen touch.“Do not touch and then give the command as it’s backwards.“This requires a drill‘Feel my finger.’ Then touch a point” LRHSCHOOLS OF HEALINGThe thing that’s wrong with each school of healing is that it says it can do the jobtotally. It can’t. An example of this is a Swedish masseur saying he can cure a person.But in addition to massage, let us say, the person doesn’t eat. It’s not part of the cure,so doesn’t cure.The doctor’s bug is diagnosis. He is even setting up a computer system in thecountry to figure out what is with the person. But they don’t have logic or the DataSeries to program from so they won’t make it.There is a big hole in Adele Davis’s book on dieting. She doesn’t talk enoughabout iodine on diets, but that is what activates thyroid which burns up the food. So herreducing diets don’t always reduce.If you block out the fields of knowledge you won’t get anywhere.To cure things a doctor should use a number of things (schools of healing) and doeach one right.Regard body with a question mark in your mind.There is a “brain” at each joint. This is why acupuncture works. One can paralyzea whole body area with it by touching these minor “brains” with a needle. It can doother things as well if you know how.MESMERISMMesmerism is no relation to hypnotism at all. Mesmerism is animal magnetism.It’s a physiological rapport. Not a concentration on mental but on mental-physiological.To have rapport with something you can be it.504"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"Hypnotism is the reduction and absorption of mental power of the person. Inhypnotism one takes over the person. The subject has no control.When doing physical healing, if you stroke sympathetically (both sides)alternately inducing a rhythmic motion which is monotonous, you can mesmerize aperson.In Mesmerism there is an imposition on feeling. If you mesmerize a person andpinch your back, he will get red in the same place and feel the pain of the pinch. This isphysiological rapport. No words are said during mesmerism.In assists you don’t want rapport; avoid a rhythm; on stroking in massages keepperson talking; keep him saying Yes and you acking in an assist. Keep him in commwith you. That is why you use the comm cycle, or else all feeling can go out of thebody. The comm cycle prevents a mesmeric trance occurring that would leave thepatient in rapport.Rapport is mutual feelingness.In an assist (1) Keep talking, (2) Break rhythms, (3) End off. This is important.Mesmerism is the transfer of the feeling and fault of operator to patient. A womandoing massages quietly and rhythmically could be giving her patient her disjointed hip.A doctor with bad eyesight can make his patients worse or vice versa possibly, if hehad good eyesight, patient could get good eyesight.
