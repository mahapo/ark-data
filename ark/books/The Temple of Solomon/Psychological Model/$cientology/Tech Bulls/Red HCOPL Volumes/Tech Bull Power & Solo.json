The processes require the most skilled and exact application and have exact phenomena to be observed which becomes impossible to supervise outside the above departments. Only Class VI auditors may audit these processes first only at Saint Hill and only under the supervision of Mary Sue Hubbard until they have learned them perfectly. Training on such processes can be undertaken only by Provisional Class VI auditors after leaving the course, and only enrolled on staff as Internes in the Department of Review or the HGC. Orgs not having personnel so trained by Interneship may not use these processes in their Review Departments. The fact of having a Review personnel trained in Review at Saint Hill does not permit an org to train new Review personnel in the org. Anybody in an org’s Review who will be using or supervising the use of Power Processes must have been interned at Saint Hill. Such training, however, gives no right to train others. Holding this policy firmly guarantees the full success technically in all cases in any org in the world. Avoiding it in any way jeopardizes that success. These power"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"processes are simple. But so is T. N. T. The reason for this is that there is no adequate repair for errors made in running these processes if their existing remedies are also goofed. The strongest, swiftest Ethics action must follow any slightest violation of the above for these processes alone guarantee sweeping success for Scientology on the roughest cases everywhere. Any auditor who discovers that the pc he is auditing has been illegally audited previously on a power process or any higher level process for which the pc is not graded must report the matter at once to the nearest HCO Ethics Section by collect wire or phone call. R6 NEW STUDENTS Before enrollment in the R6 unit of the SHSBC all students who have not been run on the Power Processes and who have any slightest difficulty with R6 EW must be ordered at once to the Review Case Cracking Section for Power Processes. Any student not showing adequate case gain on the course must be ordered to the Review Case Cracking Section. The Power Processes must not appear on any check sheet.

This badge consists of a 3” X 2” white card with the lettering neatly printed on it in black, preferably sheathed in plastic.

The data on this overwhelmingly demands this policy be FIRMLY applied with no exceptions. These wonderful processes are capable of making a Release from even -34 in every case to which they are applied. Run by new Class VI auditors who have been star- checked at Saint Hill on them, goofs of huge magnitude have been made. In orgs, without full Class VII trained auditors, the Power Processes just wouldn’t work at all. Pcs would be folding up like accordions, Releases just wouldn’t happen. Tremendous experience and the closest supervision preceded by full training in the D of Ping of the Processes as well as running them is vital to success. They are easy. But until every faintest kink is taken out of an auditor’s auditing and every possible eventuality has been shown to him and until he has seen what misuse can do, the auditor cannot handle them. Thus Ethics must be very alert to illegal use of Power Processes. And must be very severe about it. Otherwise there will be some very sick pcs around and administrative chaos. There are then two grades of processes which demand the highest quality of training before they produce results. One is Class VI materials. The other is Class VII materials, the Power Process. This is no effort to make a monopoly. It is simply responsibility. After all, auditing on them is available right now. Training for Class VI and VII is available this very minute at Saint Hill. The technology will be passed on for training use in an Org when an Org is a Class VII Org- 22 to wit when it is fully qualified to teach and use them and when its Executive Secretaries of HCO and the Org and its Division Secretaries are Clears and its Tech and Qual personnel are Releases.

A result of test auditing done in the Sea Org following HCOB 2, November 1968 which states to remove all possible charge off a case before running the grades on it. THE STANDARD RUN DOWN which has proven to bring INVARIABLE STANDARD RESULTS NO MATTER THE BACKGROUND OF THE CASE IS AS FOLLOWS: 1. Clear each Rud per Scientology dictionary before running ( HCOB 13.12.68 ). 2. Fly each rud. 3. Do a pc assessment form; to get data on the case. 4. Assess “auditors, auditing etc.. per C/ S handbook C/ S 6” and prepcheck the result to F/ N. This cleans up any goofed auditing history he might have. And in the case of pc’s knowing very little terminology one goes through the assessment first clearing each word. This is different from say an LX1 assessment where such is forbidden as they are words contained in the bank. The assessment mentioned consists of SCIENTOLOGY TERMINOLOGY and as such is a different matter."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" 5. A complete beginner will at this point be run on ARC S/ W. 6.

If point 7 calls for engram and secondary running one does the same of course. AND YOU ALWAYS START OFF WITH SECONDARIES. The moment sufficient charge is off the case he’ll automatically go into the engrams. At that moment you cease running secondaries for THAT PARTICULAR BRACKET ONLY, and continue on engrams. 24 At this point the C/ S sees the folder and decides whether or not another 7 case assessment and/ or the LX1 R/ down is necessary. In practice we have found it always is. 12. Assess LX1 or 7 cases or both, omitting the item handled. 13. Handle the result.

How do you control it so it doesn’t backfire or disappear? Man has searched for the answers to these questions for eons. History books are glutted with tales of political intrigue and gory battles fought to capture that elusive goal, power. But, has anyone ever really gained power with a sword or a gun? Can a person maintain power, even if it’s given to him, if he knows not how to use it? Real power comes from being oneself. When a person has knowledge and certainty of himself and can hold his position, then he is truly powerful. But how can a person hold his own position when the reactive mind works against him, making him forget his true goals and his true identity? The answer exists on Power Processing. The Power Processes are a major step towards getting rid of the Reactive Mind. “ These knock out all factors of the track that force a person back into the R6 Bank (the Reactive Mind) and leave the person able to go into or get out of the R6 Bank easily. The person ceases to respond like a homo sapiens and has a fantastic capability to learn and act. “ - L. Ron Hubbard On Power you’ll finnd out wwhat the forces are that drive a person back into his bank and you’ll become free from their bad effects. What is more you’ll find yourself on the first of the confidential grades of Scientology. From Power on up through Clear and OT the processes are confidential. 26 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor , East , Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 11 MAY , AD 15 By Hand Saint Hill Only SCIENTOLOGY V I I Confidential Issue Qualifications Division Only ( Star- rated Checkout ) THE POWER PROCESSES There are three Power Processes being run at this time. They are known as the Source, Existence, and the Conditions Process. I - Source Definition: SOURCE: That from which something comes or develops; place of origin; cause. Source Process Commands 1. Tell me a source."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" 2. Tell me about it. 3. Tell me a no source. 4. Tell me about it. Flattening the Source Process The Source Process is ended when the preclear experiences brightness and solidity changes in the Auditing room. The preclear will comment that the room is brighter and more solid. Source Process Auditing of Commands 1. Clear the word “source” and the word “no source” by having the preclear look up the definition in the dictionary. 2. Clear the command, “Tell me a source.” 3. Clear the command, “Tell me a no source.” 4. Clear the command, “Tell me about it.” THEORY OF THE SOURCE PROCESS The Source Process is used to get a preclear not only to answer the Auditing command and tell where it is coming from, but also to handle the preclear on the entire scale from NO SOURCE to TOTAL SOURCE to AWARENESS OF SOURCES. 27 The No - Source Case One of the lowest levels of cases is the case who has never caused anything and who does not recognize that anyone else can cause things. This case is one of totally fixed attention units, all of which are completely fixated on something which is not there, but which is meaningful and malevolent; therefore, this case has sought the refuge of the nonexistence of source to avoid this something. To such a case there is no existence, and no conditions. Recognizing no source, this preclear, therefore, has no auditor, is not himself there either, and of course, has never done anything. Preclears in this state can quite easily admit to having done most anything because in actuality they have not ever done anything. Further, cases at NO SOURCE have no awareness of any emotion or sensation although they can exhibit physically the manifestations of emotion and sensation, but their awareness of doing so is nil or at the most a slight curiosity that their bodies are reacting in an odd manner. Everything is pointless to such a case as there is NO SOURCE and therefore no way to effect any changes. Such a case is self- invalidative, irresponsible, and speaks in total generalities, such reflecting the no source of causation. This person, too, is haunted by ghosts, delusions, and false Beings, all of which are phenomena of no source. The individual is quite theety- weety. The perception of such a case as the NO SOURCE case is that the environment is either rather dark or transparent. An Auditor, to get reality concerning how the world looks to such a case, should look at the reflection of a room as mirrored in"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"a window. The Total Source Case Up scale to a degree from the NO SOURCE case is the TOTAL SOURCE CASE, the case which is pretending to be total source when obviously the person is not. Here we have the megalomaniac, the self- assertive case, the pathological braggart, and the guilt case. Such cases think they cause everything or pretend to cause everything or think they have caused things they haven’t or pretend to cause things which they haven’t. Such cases are continuously making false assignments of cause. Such cases tend in two directions because they are “cause of everything,” they are guilty for all that has happened or is happening or because they are “cause of everything”, they are in a state of fighting everyone else in their environment as fancied threats to their own false cause. In the latter case falls the paranoid who is certain that he is being “done- in” because he is so important that the “FBI is after him.” Such a case, if he recognizes other source at all, recognizes it only as a threat to him or as a bad causation which only he can right. Usually such cases as the TOTAL SOURCE case flip- flops between the two extremes in his considerations - “he is either a guilty, horrible, blameworthy creature” or “he is a genius, a fantastic being whom others are trying to get at.” In auditing such a case as the TOTAL SOURCE case, the auditor for this preclear does not exist either, as such a preclear can admit of no other source or if the Auditor does exist, the Auditor is only to this preclear a source of distraction or a source of bad cause. If he is in propitiation to the Auditor, it will be those “above the Auditor” who are the source of bad cause. What the Auditor must recognize and know about both the NO SOURCE case and the TOTAL SOURCE case, and the various harmonics of such as dramatized on various dynamics, is that neither case can as- is, either because there is no source at all or because source is mis- assigned. As- isness can only occur with the proper assignment of source or authorship. Since the ability to perceive source is the key to solving problems, such people have enormous numbers of problems, but never seem to describe the real problem; thus they seem quite baffling. 28 Definitions: ATTENTION UNIT: A theta energy quantity of awareness existing in the mind in varying quantity from person to person. FIXED ATTENTION UNITS: Attention units which are caught somewhere down the Time Track in one incident or another in the form of entheta. GENERALITY: A general or nonspecific statement which is applicable to all and used to connote a statement made in an effort to either hide cause or to overwhelm another person with the all- inclusive. MEGALOMANIAC: A person who has delusions of grandeur, wealth, power, etc. DELUSION: A belief in something which is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception, misconception, or misassignment. PARANOID: A person with delusions, as of grandeur or, especially, persecution. II. EXISTENCE"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" Definition: EXISTENCE: An existing state or fact of being; life; living; continuance of being; an occurrence; specific manifestation. Existence Process Commands 1. What is? 2. What isn’t. Flattening the Existence Process The Existence Process is ended when the preclear gets into present time. Some preclears are “stuck in present time.” In such cases they will begin answering in present time and then cycle back on the Time Track and back into present time, many times repeating the cycle from present to past to present to past to present, each time going less far into the past until they are finally “in present time” for many commands. Existence Process Auditing of Commands 1. Clear the word “is” and clear the word “Isn’t” by having the preclear look up the definition in the dictionary. 2. Clear the question, “What is?” 3. Clear the question, “What isn’t?” THEORY OF THE EXISTENCE PROCESS The Existence Process is used to unburden the engram the preclear is stuck in so the 29 preclear can appear to come to present time. This process handles obsessive pretense, chronic alter- is, and dub- in, both in present time and on the track or objective dub- in and subjective dub- in. With the Source Process, the Auditor improved the preclear’s ability to be aware of the sources of things. Now with the Existence Process, the Auditor is to improve the preclear’s ability to be aware of the existence of the actual and the non- existence of the inactual. This process removes the extraneous incidents off the engram in which the preclear is stuck so that the preclear apparently comes to present time. Definitions: PRETENSE: A claim, profession, or allegation which is falsely made or assumed or stated. AS- ISNESS: This is the basic statement of Reality in the technology of Auditing and one of its major contributions. Instead of puzzling as to WHO made the universe or WHAT made it, the Auditor simply perceives that it IS. However, if you attempt to erase an “engram that didn’t happen” (dub- in) or get relief by running a problem that never existed, there is no case gain. Why? Because one can only confront or erase what IS, not an alteration of what IS. To AS- IS something is to"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"look at it AS it IS really, without decoration, excuse, embellishment, dub- in, lies, twists, and all that. The alterations prevent the erasure of the actual IS- NESS of the existence or the past or a problem, etc. One has to confront the truth of it without twists to erase it. A preclear who twists things, looks at birds and calls them birds when they are really chickens or was “punished every day” when no one actually touched him, can not erase any part of the bank. Thus, one sees no Range Arm or improvement. The Pc is working on fantasy or reputational excuses and isn’t AS- ISing. This must be cured before a preclear can make any real gains. The way to handle it is by getting the preclear to gradually come to looking at things as they are. When the preclear can do this, he or she can now “AS- IS”, which is to say, erase bank by looking at it. This is the purpose of the Existence Process. The Pc does not have to understand why it works to have it work. It just works. ALTER- IS: To introduce a change, and therefore time and persistence into an ASISNESS to obtain persistency. An introduction of an alter- is is, therefore, the addition of a lie to the real, which causes it to persist and not to blow or as- is. OBJECTIVE DUB- IN: The manifestation of putting, unknowingly, perceptions which do not in actual fact exist, in the environment. SUBJECTIVE DUB- IN: The manifestation of putting, unknowingly, perceptions which do not in actual fact exist, into incidents on the Time Track. III - CONDITIONS Definition: CONDITION: Anything called for as a requirement before the performance, completion, or effectiveness of something else; provision; stipulation. Anything essential to the existence or occurrence of something else; anything that modifies or restricts the nature, existence, or occurrence of something else; external circumstances or factors. Manner or state of being. Proper or healthy state. Conditions process commands 30 1. Tell me an existing condition. 2. Tell me how you’ve handled it. Flattening the conditions process The Conditions Process is ended when the preclear has a revivification of the engram in which he/ she is stuck on the Time Track. It is preceded at times by anaten or a secondary engram (misemotional) or both. Conditions process auditing of commands 1. Clear the words, “existing” and “condition” by having the preclear look up the definitions in the dictionary. 2. Clear the command, “Tell me an existing condition.” "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"3. Clear the word “handled” by having the preclear look up the definition in the dictionary. 4. Clear the command, “Tell me how you handled it.” THEORY OF THE CONDITIONS PROCESS The Conditions Process handles the engram the preclear is stuck in and knocks apart the stuck point on the Time Track. It is aimed at the preclear who is out of present time, but who is fighting a back track enemy as though it was in present time, and who is, therefore, solving a problem in present time which has ceased to exist in life. Because of this, the preclear is hostile, covert, and antagonistic. The case of the continuing perpetration’s in present time is resolved with the Conditions Process. All of this case’s continual perpetration’s in present time are efforts to solve the engram in which the preclear is stuck. The Conditions Process results in a revivification of this engram in which the preclear is stuck and thereby frees the individual on the Time Track so he can now really be in present time. While the preclear will recall or remember many incidents, and while he seems to be in many, he is, in actual fact, only in ONE and has been there for a long time with other incidents piling up on it. The Pc will eventually REVIVIFY (relive) the actual engram briefly and come for the first time to present time. That is the end of the process. A secondary (misemotional incident) has to have an engram (a moment of pain and unconsciousness) under it to be a secondary and remain in place. That is why it is called a secondary. A preclear commonly goes through the secondary (misemotional) charge before he revivifies. Thus the appearance of a secondary is a sign that one is approaching THE engram. One does not run the secondary or engram as a Auditor. One just goes on running the Conditions Process commands. It is a severe goof to stop or change processes just because the Pc has hit a secondary or the key engram. One runs the process exactly. When the Pc revivifies a few more commands usually gets him into PT and ends the process. It is a severe goof to overrun or underrun the process. 31 End words Sometimes persons who couldn’t run R- 6 well have had end words fly off for a while when run on one or another of the Power Processes. This soon ceases and the Pc runs quite normally. It’s just their R- 6 Auditing coming off. However, the major symptom of overrunning the process is that the Pc, his “Time Track” blown by a revivification, begins to clear off real end words much like R- 6EW. If a Pc has revivified and the process is overrun, it can become quite severe in reaction as the Pc will stick into the R- 6 bank! However, a preclear can be overrun for several days without being smashed. But don’t do it. Further Definitions "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PRESENT TIME: The time which is now and which becomes the past almost as rapidly as it is observed. It is a term loosely applied to the environment existing in now, as in “the Preclear came up to present time,” meaning the Preclear became aware of the existing matter, energy, space, and time of now. The point on anyone’s Time Track where his physical body (if alive) may be found. “Now.” STUCK IN PRESENT TIME: The condition of a person being incapable of moving on the Time Track into the past. In actuality the Preclear is in some incident which forces him to be in the apparent present. REVIVIFICATION: The bringing back to life of an engram in which a Preclear is stuck. The engram or some portion thereof is being acted out in present time by the Preclear. It is called a revivification because the engram is suddenly more real to the Preclear than present time has ever been. He re- lives that moment briefly. He does not merely recall or remember it. AN ENGRAM: A mental image picture of an experience containing pain, unconsciousness and a real or fancied threat to survival; it is a recording in the mind of something which actually happened to the Preclear in the past which contained pain and unconsciousness, both of which are recorded in the mental image picture called an engram. ANATEN: A composite of two words, “analytical attenuation,” or partial or complete dilution or weakening of the functions of the analytical mind. The Preclear goes “unconscious” for a moment in the session. A SECONDARY: A secondary engram is a mental image picture of a moment in the past containing misemotion - anger, fear, grief, apathy - where loss either is threatened or accomplished. However, a secondary can not exist unless an engram underlies it. TIME TRACK: The consecutive mental image pictures recording the consecutive moments of “now” through which the individual has lived. It consists of locks, secondaries, and engrams. L. RON HUBBARD LRH : msh : cs Copyright (c) 1965 by L. Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 32 THE POWER PROCESSES POWER PROCESS 1AA (Pr Pr 1AA) 1.

You will always mess up a case if you do. On VA, letting pc Itsa instead of getting F/ N on the additional steps is a goof. You take the first BD and handle it with No. 2 HCOB 6.6.66. Do not let the pc list on and on. It happens that the first BD (not necessarily BD F/ N) on listing is the item on VA but on a rework during a Rehab, the item may not BD. The list has to be nulled. The bulletin on the Laws of Listing must be followed. If the Pc gets ill after VA is complete, you should do an L4 to get the correct item, as the item found is probably not correct. VA is best run in one go. It is possible when a Pr Pr is left unflat at end of session for the end phenomena to occur between sessions. It should always be checked next session. In running Power, HIGH TA MEANS OVERRUN. You will always find an ARC break, PTP, M/ W/ H, Overt, Life Overrun, Self Auditing - something. Could even be a “coffee shop” session. Locate it. Get TA down. The rule is: DON’T START POWER OR ANY POWER PROCESS OR ANY GRADE PROCESS with the TA risen since last session or break. GET IT DOWN FIRST. L.

The purpose of Power is not to see how many Pcs one can audit in an hour but TO GIVE LASTING GAINS TO THE PC. In the first place, the case has to be set up for Power. All Dn Triples must have been run and the Pc must have gone whole track. Without Whole Track, don’t expect Power or anything else to last. All QScn Triples must have been successfully run. Any and all preparatory actions to make the case sure of full gains and all psychosomatic illnesses must have been handled by auditing. Given those requisites, one comes to Power. Each Power process has its own End Phenomena - Pr Pr 4, 5 and 6. You don’t run Power to just an F/ N. You audit it to: 1. F/ N. 2. The End Phenomena for that Power Process. 3. VGIs. The old saw “All Clearing Practitioners talk too much” was never truer than in Power. The first F/ N you see on the process in Power finds the Pc still introverted (looking inward). If you just carry on - maybe one more command or so you will see the Pc hit the end phenomena and extrovert. 39 Then VGIs will come in. The F/ N will broaden widely and really float. Now tell him his needle is floating if you like. But don’t use “I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” to chop off the end phenomena! SPEED AND RESULT "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Somewhere somebody got the idea that a “really good Clearing Practitioner can go from Grade 0 to IV in 15 minutes” and “Pr Pr 4 to VA 1C in 20 minutes.” Speed has nothing to do with it. As long as you don’t have a Pc waiting for commands, speed is a worthless commodity in auditing. One audits for results. The results of Pr Pr 4, 5 and 6 are the End Phenomena. Each of these 3 processes has its own particular end phenomena and if that isn’t obtained, YOU HAVE NOT DELIVERED POWER. I re- researched all this very recently and these end phenomena occur shortly after the first appearance of the F/ N. And when they occur you get a really wide float and a very happy pc. The pc may or may not say what happened but he sure will extrovert (look outward) sometimes with awe. Well, awe is not VGIs. What you really see is relief and then VGIs. So let him get his end phenomena. If you don’t, you leave a bit of charge there, by- passed, which can result in an ARC Break later with Scientology. ARC Breaks are by- passed charge. And did you know that the first beginnings of an F/ N are often an ARC Break coming off the incident or bank? The pc goes rapidly uptone as the F/ N widens. So don’t sell the team out. Run Power : 1.

Early on my Pcs went keyed out clear and went away. They stayed that way a long time. They were sure they had attained the zenith. Today we are going to have the same problem. Bits and pieces of the whole track remain after the locks, secondaries and engrams are reduced. These bits inhibit the Being from recovering knowledge. To obtain a Grade VA Release one has to tackle the Beings, places and subjects one has long detested. And when these are gone, one isn’t likely to be called back into the Reactive Mind very soon, as bits of his daily life don’t remind him of Beings, places and subjects he once detested. Now understand, at each of these stages one has to go unrelease to make it to the next stage of release. This requires guts- and faith. One is feeling GRAND. The world is beautiful. The unbrave get nervous at the thought of diving back into the asphalt. Add to all this that one has a present time, and a body to receive the slings and arrows and one sees that it is a complex picture. But we have the way. It is the way. Many will come along selling the frightening idea one can leap up through the numbers without pain or toil or Clearing by flexing one’s chest or eating wheaties or praying. But that isn’t the WAY.

There is a probable bug in the listing of all previous Routine 3 processes. I have been studying this for some time to solve why we are getting too few Clears after the goal is found. And why they are sometimes unclear after their needle frees. The answer comes out of Routine 2- 12. Never represent a rock slamming item. A rocket read as on a goal often follows this rule and becomes never represent a rocket reading item."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":" ln all previous R3 we were representing the rocket reading goal in two of the four lines and opposing it backwards in the remaining two. People went Clear on the four, sixteen and other multiple lines but something must have been wrong as others didn’t. Therefore abandon at once any listing on any older line series. A goal may be listed only on “Who or what does the goal oppose?” Never on who or what would want or not want the goal as that approximates a represent line to some cases. Do not list anything but goal- oppose. Never list even oppose- goal. I learned all this shaping up Routine 2. ___________ Wrong goals are still dynamite. But this newly developed listing below helps prove a goal out. Goal reliable items rocket read. If a goal won’t yield RR reliable items it’s probably wrong. In Routine 2, you use rock slams. The bigger the rock slam the better it will go for the pc. 55 In Routine 3 you use rocket reads, never rock slams. Routines 2 and 3 therefore do not mix. While you may encounter and use rocket reads in Routine 2, don’t mix goals into it. Goals just naturally emerge in doing Routine 2. When they check out, get the pc run on Routine 3. In Routine 3 you wholly ignore rock slams and use only rocket reads. To fill the gap I have put Routine 3MX together as a theoretical process. ___________ OLD GOALS Use your pc’s already- found goal. Prepcheck it back to a rocket read and use Routine 3MX from there on. ___________ ROUTINE 3MX For Experimental Use by Class III and IV Auditors and Z Unit SHSBC INTRODUCTION Routine 3MX is released as experimental. It is however already well worked out and as soon as I find any and all bugs, the X will be dropped. R3MX uses all I’ve learned about listing items in R2 and applies it to listing out goals. "},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"For the moment Z Unit of the SHSBC will use only R3MX, utilizing goals already found on R2MX Method A. ASSESSING FOR GOALS METHOD A Assessment for goals in R3MX Method A is by meter listing and rocket read. After doing R2- 12A on the pc and a good prepcheck, particularly on former goals work, one has the pc list goals in session on the meter. One lists the tone arm action out and goes well beyond. If the pc has already listed goals with none found list more on the pc to check for TA action. If it exists list it out. One looks for and notes goals that rocket read. 56 One then takes these rocket reading goals and tiger drills them, preferably the last one that rocket read first as it is the most likely. If pc ARC breaks, the list is probably incomplete according to R2 findings. So complete it. Don’t list, in Method A, goals from items or detour. Just go on and on listing goals. Do a Prepcheck on goals every fourth session. The list may go to 2,000 goals. But if it goes so high or beyond, the pc needs more R2- 12A. METHOD B R3MX Method B uses the ten lists of 3GAXX but uses any Routine 2 reliable item that still rock slams or one preferably that rocket reads. This method is not covered in this HCOB but will be familiar to Saint Hillers. METHOD C R3MX Method C uses R2- 12A until the goal starts pushing up and the pc starts insisting upon it without any prompting from the auditor. One does not grab the goal. The auditor notes it down. If one keeps on doing R2- 12A well, the goal will eventually rocket read easily for a checkout. Rock slams on a case indicate a lot of distance down to rocket reads. METHOD D R3MX Method D uses Problems Intensives until the goal appears. This has happened in many cases. GOAL CHECKOUT The goal must rocket read three times in three to be used for listing. If not, do more R2- 12A and check the goal out later. 57 LISTING GOALS OUT Goals listing was a more serious hazard in Routine 3 than finding goals. This simplified listing, while as yet theoretical in some respects, should be easier"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"than any earlier listing. It is done like R2- 12A but by rocket reads only. LINE ASSESSMENT One takes the goal found, makes sure that it rocket reads well (not rock slams) and assesses as follows: Use the pain- sensation analysis of the goal. If pain (as it should be) one tests: “Who or what would the goal ‘To be a Tiger oppose? ’ “ Or, “Who or what would ‘Being a Tiger oppose? ’ “ (the ‘ing’ form of the goal). One or the other question should rocket read. Use that one. We list just this one list on the goal itself and after that use reliable items that rocket read. Using long sheets of paper with the pc’s name, date and line question on every sheet, we write down all the items called off by the pc. We mark rock slams and rocket reads as we see them. We list to a still TA and then 50 items at least beyond and 50 items beyond the last rocket read (not a rock slam ever). We don’t null the list. We read the next to last rocket read to the pc and then the last rocket read item (and the item just above and below) and see if the tests of 2- 12A hold good (cogs, no ARC break, sudden drop of TA, lightening face color, etc.). If so, it’s the pc’s reliable item. We now begin the “Spiral Staircase.” We oppose and oppose and oppose and oppose and oppose always according to whether term or oppterm as long as we can as follows: We determine if the reliable item is a term or oppterm by calling it off to the pc for pain or sensation and then by test listing both- ways- to on the oppose. The wrong way tightens the needle and gives no real TA action. The right way loosens the needle and gives good TA action. Example: We found “Kitten” as the reliable item. We test for pain or sensation on it and find it gave pain. (Term) We list “Who or what would oppose a kitten?” then “Who or what would a kitten oppose?” and, guided by our test (pain) also and a loosening needle and moving TA, we complete the list, “Who or what would a kitten oppose?” 58 We list to a still TA and 50 items or more beyond and 50 past the last rocket read. We give the pc the next to last item that rocket read on listing, then the last rocket read item. We watch for the signs. (If it isn’t right we go on listing.) If there are two rocket reads still firing on the list it is incomplete and we must complete it. Thus we find our reliable item. In short we find reliable item after reliable item just exactly as above each time but always by rocket read, not rock slam. This is a “Spiral Staircase” down toward the Rock and Opp Rock. We pay no further heed to the goal until our “Spiral Staircase” folds up on us. No"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"more rocket reads on the lists or bank getting too solid. In brief, when we run out of reliable items, we go back to the goal we were using, we test it, mildly prepcheck it (put the big mid ruds in on it) and try to revive it. If it sparks up, rocket reads again or reads, we do all the above steps, the assessment from the 2 questions, the list, the first reliable item, the “Spiral Staircase” again. If we can’t get a peep out of the old goal, and our auditing was good, we just do another Goals Assessment and find a new goal that rocket reads and start all over again. ___________ As soon as I find what mistakes can be made, I’ll recodify and we’ll have an improved R3- 21 and I’ll take the X off. ___________ We need Clears as we’ve never needed them before and we need them now and we therefore need simpler, faster clearing. I’ve got R2 smoothed out in R2- 12A and it’s a real doll. Now I’m smoothing out R3- 21 using everything learned in watching R2- 12 in use, but using rocket reads not rock slams. L.

This process turned out to be R3- MX. The X at this writing is dropped as the process has proven itself and it becomes Routine 3- M. The designation of “M” is simply its consecutive letter in the development series, but it could stand for “Mary Sue” as she did the actual auditing under my direction that proved its rules. The rules of 3- MX were worked out in Routine 2- 12 and 2- 12A and then by examining Rocket Reading Item behaviour in 3- MX. The first thing you should know about 3- M is that it is more precise in application than any process you have handled. When it says “List the Tone Arm Action out and then 25 Items more” it means exactly that. (Surges of the needle don’t count in TA action as you couldn’t follow them with the TA and back that fast.) When R3- M says “List 25 Items Beyond the last RR or RS on a list” it means 25, not 24. In 3- M it says Rocket Reading Item and that’s what it means. And a Rocket Read is a Rocket Read not a fall. R3- M is therefore a masterpiece of precision. Do it wrong- not exactly by the rules- and it becomes a real nightmare. So know it before"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"you do it, and do what it says only. In both R2- 12A and R3- M an Item can appear anywhere on a source list so long as 2 Items do not RS or RR. One Item RSing and one RRing also means list is incomplete. On the w/ w wd goal opp list (the 3- M Source List) you have to make sure list is complete to 50 Items beyond last RSing or RRing Item and 50 beyond no TA action point (where TA stops moving). This is true for both 3- M and 2- 12A. You read every RRing Item back to pc from the 3- M Source List (goal opp) and every RSing Item on the 2- 12A source list. A source list is of course the primary list from the goal from which you get the first RRing RI. In 2- 12A the source list is what you choose to get your first list from or List One. 60 All other lists in 3- M are extended 25 Items beyond the last RR or RS and the Item is always the last RR on the list- if not you’ve goofed, didn’t get the TA action out of this or the just prior list. In 2- 12A you go 50 Items beyond the last RS and 50 beyond the 1st still TA. The 8 tests for mass increase, etc, must be done on every Item found in 3- M and 2- 12A. The best coverages of R- 3M are the HCO Bulletin of Feb 1, 1963, “Routine 3”, and the two hours of lecture of Feb 7, 1963, where it is covered. HCO Bulletins and other lectures will be forthcoming. R2- 12A If R3- M emerges so suddenly, then what of Routine 2- 10, 2- 12 and 2- 12A? With the single caution that you must not try to package a small RS and only use a wide RS (1/ 3 of a dial or more) as your source list’s RI, 2- 12A is very successful just as laid down. It will continue to be taught, and used. In it you have some very precise Rules. A list is continued 50 Items beyond the last RS. Never represent an RSing Item. Always carry a wide RSing RI around to a package of 4. It is not important how you get your first RI so long as it didn’t come from representing an RSing Item. The last RS on the list opposing an RI is the Right Item always unless you’ve goofed. There must not be 2 RSing Items on a list (except List One where you choose the biggest RS as your first RI). If two appear, your list is incomplete or you let the pc (as you must never do) Represent an RR or RS he’s heard or seen on the list. You don’t nul in 2- 12A (or 3- M), you just read the next to last, then the last RS or RR Item. Tough cases, the RS grabbed off List One Issue 3, will change with 2- 12A. Rockslammers sit back and get relaxed. The process is valuable. Therefore it must be taught and used. But as R3- M is even easier than 2- 12A, it also must be taught in Academies and used in HGCs. Valid Processes, then, are 1. The CCHs."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":" 2. Assists. 3. Ruds and Havingness. 4. Pulling Missed W/ Hs. 5. Prepchecking. 6. Problems Intensives. 7. R2- 12A. 8. R3- M.

RON HUBBARD Founder 61 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 22 FEBRUARY 1963 Missions CenOCon ROUTINE 3M RUNDOWN BY STEPS (HCO Secs Check out more thoroughly than any you’ve ever checked before on all staff auditors and staff clearing people. SHSBC Lecture of 26 Feb. 1963 also covers this HCOB.) The steps of Routine 3M are as follows: PREPARE THE GOAL 1. Get the goal prepchecked so that some rocket reads are seen. Get it checked out. It may only have been seen to rocket read sometime in the past and will not now rocket read; prepcheck it until it RRs at least once. If so, go to Step 2. (3M can be started without having the goal if you have an RR RI from 2- 12, if so start 3M with Step 8 and find goal as in Step 15.) DETERMINE GOAL QUESTION 2. Determine, by meter and by what the pc can answer, the wording for the goal oppose line: “Who or what would the goal oppose?” “Who or what would oppose?” “Who or what would somebody or something with the goal ____ oppose? “ “Who or what would (ing version of the goal) oppose?” Use only one of the above and use no other wording for the question."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":" LIST SOURCE LIST 3. List a list in the usual way on a meter, watching carefully for rocket reads or rock slams as the pc gives items. Note these accurately on the list. If no R/ Ses or RRs appear on this list assume that the goal was wrong or that the pc has been suppressed by other listing below RR or R/ S. Do not proceed if no RRs or R/ Ses were seen while listing; relegate the case to 2- 12 repair (see below) or other goal finding. If R/ Ses or RRs are seen on listing, proceed to next step. COMPLETE SOURCE LIST 4. List the list no less than 50 items (by actual count) beyond the last R/ S or RR 62 (whichever was last). In actual fact all TA action should be off the list by this time but auditors have trouble in some instances in interpreting what is TA action on the list. Keep going if you know what “no TA action” is but don’t use “. 005 divisions TA change” as an excuse to list pc black in the face. TEST LIST 5. Test list by reading two R/ Ses or RRs back to pc. If only one R/ S or RR is reading on the list, it is complete. If two are reading continue the list until you have new R/ Ses or RRs and 50 beyond the last one again. Then retest. Be sure list is complete, by which is meant “it has an R/ Sing or RRing item reading on it but not two, and an RI is on the list.” FIND RI 6. Search out the R/ Sing or RRing item by reading each one marked RR on listing back to pc. One should rocket read or rock slam without TD. If none are found that now R/ S or RR, read the non- R/ S, non- RR items just above and below each marked R/ S or RR. (You may have mistaken which item R/ Sed or RRed.) Work at it until you’ve found the reliable (reading on the meter when read back to the pc) item. If none R/ S or RR use small tiger on those that DR. If still none R/ S or RR extend the list until new R/ Ses or RRs are seen. If no RI yet, null the whole source list. You only do this with goal- oppose (source) list. CLEAN UP RI 7. Get the big mid ruds in on the reliable item found. If it R/ Sed it will turn into an RR if big mid ruds are put in on it. But even if it only still R/ Sed, proceed to next step. If it vanishes without being listed extend goal- oppose list. DETERMINE WHETHER TERMINAL OR OPPTERM 8. Determine if the RI is a terminal or an oppterm. Just because an oppterm was indicated by the list question is no reason an oppterm will come up. If an exaltedsounding item it is probably an oppterm. If a degraded reversal of the goal it is probably a terminal. As more RIs accumulate on the line plot the less this is true. It finally reverses. Use any tests released. Wrong- way- to gives more mass to pc and reads less on meter. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"LIST THE RI 9. List the RI as a terminal “Who or what would (RI) oppose?” or as an oppterm “ Who or what would oppose (RI) ? “ If pc’s face darkens or mass pulls in or if he can’t keep the question in mind or can’t think of answers easily or if needle tightens, etc., quickly abandon and start a new list with the reverse question. But be very careful not to keep reversing an R3 list. Don’t test list as in R2. Be right in the first place and unload fast if you’re wrong in the way it’s being opposed. The more you change the way you oppose it the more mass you’ll pull up on the 63 pc. A reverse- way oppose list also has RRs and R/ Ses on it. COMPLETE RI LIST 10. List 25 (not 23 or 20) items beyond the last R/ S or RR. If you can read a tone arm, be sure the TA action is out of the list. But don’t use TA action of one/ millionth of a division as an excuse to list the pc into the ground with overlisting. The actual rule is “25 items beyond the last TA change and 25 beyond the last RR or R/ S.” Never list less than 25 items beyond the last RR or R/ S. If a new RR or R/ S occurs go 25 beyond it. TA action can be caused by Protest, Decide, ARC break. If the pc ARC breaks after you’ve stopped listing, the list must be extended as the ARC break, no matter what the pc says, comes from the item not being on the list. This step is very easy. Just list and note down the RRs and R/ Ses seen on the meter as you list. Write fast. Get the item down correctly. Ask the list question only often enough to keep the pc listing. When he stops you ask the question. Or ask it when he asks for it. Don’t overlist. R3 overlisting is brutally cruel. Don’t underlist. Don’t miss reads. The sensitivity is set at about 3 on a Mark V and 4 on a Mark IV for listing. The eye looks across the dial at the sheet beside the meter. You move the sheet up as you write. Left- hand meters are available at HCO WW for southpaws. Put your TA reads on your listing sheet each time TA changes. CHECK RI BEING LISTED 11. Check the item you are listingfrom. If it ticks or fires, don’t do anything with the list you’ve just done. Continue it to a new RR or R/ S and do 25 beyond it. The item can read because the pc is protesting or invalidating but usually it’s just list more. If item being listed from doesn’t read, proceed to 12. READ NEW RI 12. Say to the pc, “I will now read the last rock slamming item on the list.” (Omit saying the above if the last item was an RR.) “That didn’t read.” (If it did, and an RR is above it your list is incomplete so do Step 11 again.) If it didn’t read (which it shouldn’t) say “I will now read the next- to- last rocket reading item on the list.” Do so. If it RRs or R/ Ses do Step 11 again. If it doesn’t (which it shouldn’t) say “That doesn’t read.” Now say, “I will now read the last rocket reading item on the list.” Do so. If it reads (R/ S or RR) say “That rocket reads.” or “That rock slams.” This is the one that must read. If it RRed when being written"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"down but R/ Sed when read back to pc, the only action necessary is to put in the big mid ruds on it and it will RR. If the last RR noted on list doesn’t read, then say, “I will now read the item above it.” (Read the one above, the one below, the one 2 above, the one 2 below.) As soon as you have one that fires, say, “That reads.” Now don’t do anything else when you have the item. Look silently at the pc. You will see him get lighter colored in the face, the tone arm will blow down, the meter will fire rocket reads as the pc cognites. If pc is in doubt say “That’s your item.” The needle may go free only for a space of 5 seconds if you go on into the next GPM. The residual mass of the goal you’ve just blown is held in more by the next GPM than by odd bits. So getting the next GPM is the most constructive and timesaving action. 64 END OF STEPS ____________________ COMMENTS You mustn’t let the pc represent RRing or R/ Sing item as he lists. If he knows something R/ Sed or RRed he may repeat variations of it. However, interfere as little as possible with the listing by the pc. Don’t force listing or prevent it. Mask your paper from the pc. The frequency of the bank can get thrown awry by listing both ways or by doing a list wrong- way- to and getting a reverse item. But the upset is limited to the 25- item rule. On any one GPM where goofs have occurred, you may have to extend lists due to finding a tick (Step 11). All rules and steps still apply. You just have to extend a list (as in Step 11) more often. The item doesn’t start appearing earlier on the list and the rule of the last RR is never violated. It’s just that the “25 items after the last R/ S or RR rule” becomes unworkable and you keep finding that the item you are listing from still ticks so you have to extend. Step 12 remains true. R3M is a purely mechanical activity. The better you know it, the more exactly you follow it, the more RR RIs you get, the less you figure- figure on it, the more Clears you’ll make. 3M works because of 3M, not because of auditing frills. The only thing missing from these steps is the test battery to find if an RI is a terminal or oppterm. That is given on tapes and will be the subject of a whole HCO Bulletin. When an RI that is a terminal is used as an oppterm (wrong- wayoppose) more mass turns on. And vice versa. Wrongly call an RI and it’s more mass, a darkening pc, discomfort, etc. Any RI that gives the pc unmistakable pain when said to the pc is a terminal always. The SEN is not as good to determine with as many terms also turn on SEN and no pain. Don’t test list every RI both ways. In 3M that half kills the pc. Do it only in R2. Be right before you list. Look the pc over after you’ve listed 10 items to see if the face has darkened or discolored, watch out for a tightening needle. And list right- wayto only. Do 3M carelessly or wrong and you’ll wrap the pc around a telephone pole. Crash. Be honest. Never fake a read. Never falsify a report. Somebody’s future 200 trillion depends on that honesty. If it reads, say so. If it doesn’t read, say so. Don’t try to look good at the expense of a pc’s future life."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" Repair 3M by TDing every RI on the line plot for reads. If none are reading at all, examine the lists for completeness. If these are short or goofed, complete them for an RI as per the rules. If all else fails, prepcheck the pc on auditing, listing and do a goal- oppose list. If that doesn’t RR while being listed, examine the repair steps above in that order. This pc either had a wrong goal and the auditor didn’t know a rocket read or the RR is hung up somewhere in the incomplete lists. 65 The point is, don’t goof. You can clear a whole goal GPM while trying to repair some nutty departure from 3M. You’ve got one clearing technique. Protect it. ___________ TWO TYPES OF LIST Remember, there are two types of lists in R3M: l. The goal- oppose as covered in Steps 1- 7. This is called a “Source List.” 2. The RI oppose (either way) as covered in Steps 8- 13. This is called an “RI List.” These follow different rules. The item can be any RR or R/ S seen on a goaloppose list. The item is always the last RR on the RI oppose list. Realize that all goal- oppose lists follow the rules of Steps 1- 7 and all RI oppose lists follow the rules of Steps 8- 13. There are no exceptions. If the list you’ve done as a goal- oppose source list deviates from the phenomena found in Steps l- 7, you’ve goofed, not 3M. If the RI oppose list you’ve done doesn’t contain the phenomena in Steps 8- 13, you’ve goofed, not 3M. Example: Auditor finds on an RI oppose list that the “RI” was the third RR from the bottom. That’s wrong. Complete the list. It’s that exact. ___________ OLD GOALS With the advent of 3M, the question of what to do about old goals or partially run goals or Keyed- Out Clears arises. ___________ RULE ON OLD GOALS On anybody who has ever had a goal found, whether it was listed partially or fully, run R3M just as though the goal had just been found. If it doesn’t RR now it will still give RRs on the source list from it. It is all right to test list it. If the goal was wrong it will not give RRs on the source (goal opp) list. L.

It is vital to do so. STEP ONE Third line middle sentence, correct to read: Prepcheck it until it consistently RRs at least once out of three, every time it is said three times to the pc. In a Goals Prepcheck, Tiger Drill or Mid Ruds Prepcheck, do not use, never use, “On the goal to catch catfish has anything been .” Use only and always just the wording of the actual goal: “On to catch catfish, has anything been .” See Step 2 for reasons why. STEP TWO Delete entire step. Substitute: Use only the wording, “Who or what would (the exact wording of the goal) oppose.” Do not use, “Who or what would ‘the goal to catch catfish’ oppose.” Do not use, “Who or what would ‘somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish’ oppose.” Do not use, “Who or what would ‘catching catfish’ oppose.” Why? Using the hypothetical goal “to catch catfish,” in GPMs toward the bottom there are reliable items called “The goal to catch catfish,” “Somebody with the goal to catch catfish,” “Somebody or something with the goal to catch catfish,” and “Catching catfish.” As these are RIs using anything but the naked goal in goal oppose or prepchecking can restimulate the RI and cause the goal not to fire. Therefore use only the naked goal in any operation involving the goal. Don’t add “the goal” to it or any other words. Just “To catch catfish.” L.

ROUTINE 3- M GOAL FINDING BY METHOD B"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" (Information taken from HCO Bulletin of August 22, 1962) If your pc has a Rockslamming or Rocket Reading Oppterm anywhere on his line plot, you can list goals on the following 10 questions. Be sure that the item is now RSing or RRing and that the item is proven an oppterm by actual test. METHOD B LISTING QUESTIONS What goal might you have ( 1) That would be an overt against (item)? (2) That (item) would consider impossible? (3) That (item) might consider was an overt? (4) That (item) would consider undesirable (also - for itself or themselves)? (5) That (item) would prevent you from doing? (6) That would be impossible to achieve if you were (item or part of item)? (7) That would be impossible if (item) were you? (8) That couldn’t be achieved because (item) acted as a barrier? (9) That (item) would make too difficult? (10) (Simply) What goal might you have? Complete List One to at least 50 goals past a still TA and the last RS or RR. List each of the other questions in turn. Lists Two through Ten can be continued as long as the pc lists easily on each one. Be sure to note TA position, RS and RR. Clear each question with pc before listing on it. ASSESSMENT Tiger Drill the RRing goals on List Six above first, being careful of Suppress, working it over hard. If the goal is not on List Six, use List Five. If not on Five, go over List Four. If not on List Four, Tiger Drill the RRing goals on the remaining Lists One through Ten. The pc will probably know his goal. Or his goal will recur on several of the Lists. It is most likely that the first RRing goal on List Six will be it. The goal must be checked out by a Class IV auditor before it can be listed. L.

VANISHING R/ S AND RR The ONLY thing that makes a pc’s ability to RR or R/ S vanish on a meter is finding too many RIs without finding the goal. The pc can be overwhelmed by RIs if he or she has no goal to align them to. THIS IS TRUE OF ROUTINE 2. Every RI found is part of a GPM. Finding too many (more than 4) RIs (whether they R/ S or RR) with Routine 2 or Routine 3M will narrow the pc’s ability to R/ S and RR and will cause his or her R/ S or RR to VANISH. Thereafter you will see no R/ Ses or RRs on any list. It is natural for the R/ S or RR to vanish on a Routine 2 or 3M item when it is opposed. The R/ S and RR on a goal vanish when the goal is run out. What I’m talking about is the ability of the pc to R/ S and RR on lists and new goals. ROUTINE 2 Every R2 item is a GPM RI. Find too many R2 RIs, no matter how, and fail to find a goal that RRs and you’ll not see any more R/ Ses or RRs on that pc until the goal has been found. The difficulties of finding a goal with the pc’s RR off is something I need not stress. The right goal, well prepchecked and seen to RR, will turn on the pc’s ability to R/ S and RR in general. This is life and death data. DON’T find too many R2 or 3M RIs without finding a goal. The RR and R/ S ability does not vanish by failing to package up, oppose and square away RIs. It only vanishes if you fail to find a goal. 69 Four RIs with no goal is MAXIMUM. You can get two Routine 2 RIs to help find a goal. After that STOP until the goal is found. 3DXX, ETC., ITEMS All the 3DXX, 3GA, 3GAXX items, no matter how found, must be put on a pc’s 3M line plot. They were all GPM RIs. Use them to find the goal. Get them added up to the goal when the goal is found. FAVORITE GOAL Some pcs have a second GPM goal (or third or fourth) which won’t RR yet. And is not"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"ready to run. Their attention gets so stuck on it they can’t cooperate in finding the first GPM’s goal. The thing to do is to list “ What goal might have been postulated after (favorite goal, bare words like ‘To Catch Catfish’) had failed.” This moves pc’s attention to a later GPM. And you’ll again get TA action on listing goals. By favorite goal is meant the goal that the pc thought (and fought) was his but no amount of prepchecking could make RR regularly. Most pcs on whom you can’t find a firing (RRing) goal had a favorite goal. Ask them what it was or when it went out and use it in the above. Five is the common TA read for a pc who hasn’t got a goal and is stuck on the last (now run out) goal or on a favorite (too deep) goal. When the TA goes to 5.0 or thereabouts in listing goals, and you can’t get it to move and you haven’t got a firing (RRing) goal, use the above method. It applies to R2 and R3M pcs alike at any stage of case or in any GPM. The wording can also be (for pcs in first, second or third GPM) “What goal might have failed before (last goal) was postulated.” Various wordings can be used, the intention being to get pc’s attention off a GPM and onto another GPM. CHANGE IN R3M STEP 13 As auditors can easily slide on by a GPM into the next and miss the rocket firing blowdown, or don’t heed it, this must be added to Step 13 and never omitted. If omitted you can turn off the pc’s ability to RR no matter how many (up to 5 or 6 anyway) GPMs have been run. Add after “Just take pc’s opinion for use in making tests.” NOW READ THE PC’S GOAL THREE TIMES, CAREFULLY NOTICING WHETHER IT RRs OR R/ Ses ONCE OUT OF THREE OR NOT OR IF IT TICKS OR FALLS. If the pc’s old goal only ticks or falls and the RR or R/ S has vanished, then you 70 have passed THE ROCKET FIRING BLOWDOWN. When the goal closes to RR or R/S you have only 5 or 6 or at the most 8 RIs to go before free needle occurs on that goal. Keep finding RIs so long as you can make the goal tick or fall with Tiger Drill. The moment the goal ceases to react with a tick or fall do this: l. Find a new goal by ordinary listing or any means; 2. Give the old goal an 18 button Prepcheck. Do not Tiger Drill the old goal to get it to R/ S or RR as it will briefly and then fold up. The new goal, if it R/ Ses, must be tiger drilled or prepchecked until it RRs. This happens right after a rocket firing blowdown (or blow up in low TA cases) to Clear read but auditors miss it and often a brief blowdown to Clear read occurs with the old goal still in action. The only test then is whether the old goal RRs or R/ Ses. And then in your Step 14 pick up the last RRing item on the spiral staircase, get it to fire and oppose it. Don’t do a goal oppose with the new goal. If no RRing item now exists on the line plot, then use the new goal for a goal oppose list as in Step 2 and proceed on down the steps of 3M. If you always read the goal to the pc in Step 13 and never go on opposing if the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"goal does not RR or R/ S, you will never turn off a pc’s ability to RR or R/ S and the GPMs will stay straight. To keep on opposing and finding items after the old goal has ceased to rocket read or R/ S is to court real disaster. This is the commonest auditor error in R3M, to shoot on past the old GPM and go racing into the next with no goal. Suddenly, disaster, RR and R/ S off, pc screaming. No atmosphere in which to find a new goal. R3M STEP 14 Delete second paragraph in step “Occasionally, etc.” Delete fourth paragraph. Substitute: The number of RIs in a GPM vary greatly. The first GPM encountered may be newly formed and have only two or three RIs in it. A GPM is as long as the goal of it will continue to RR or R/ S while opposing items. When its goal no longer R/ Ses or RRs when read to pc, the GPM limit has been reached. A new goal for a GPM must be made to RR before being used. Listing will improve its read. The RR then becomes an R/ S, then an RR again but latent or prior and as it finally discharges from the bank in a rocket firing blowdown and only then ticks, falls or DRs. L.

If no RRs or RSes are seen on a preclear’s list or any list while listing and also if no Items RS when called back, the preclear can be said to be ‘~ incapable of Rocket Reading or Rockslamming”. Some preclears are incapable of producing an RS or RR except on the first GPM goal when found. No matter how much Item listing is done, no matter from what source, no RR or RS is seen while listing and none is found when the list is complete. No technique to turn on a pc’s RS or RR will ever be found except one: Find the pc’s goal for the 1st GPM. WHAT MAKES RRs & RSes VANISH The thing which turns off a pc’s RR or RS is TOO MANY RELIABLE ITEMS FOUND WITHOUT FINDING THE PC’S GOAL. This can be done by life or by Auditing. As it can be done by life, some raw meat pcs will not RR or RS. It can be surmised that they have been set about in life by"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"too many Reliable Items in full view. For instance a pc has an RI, FATHER, an RI POLTTICIAN, an RI, CITY. His father is politician who insists on living in a city. These and others in his bank, although undisclosed, are yet restimulated, and this pc will not be seen to RS or RR on listing, and no RS or RR is likely to be seen even if an actual RI is found. There is no use here for a more forceful way to get RIs. The rules are very plain, unvaried and uncompromising: RULE. WHEN A PC’S RS OR RR IS OFF, STOP TRYING TO FIND MORE RIs. No matter if you could find them, the RR or RS would just go more thoroughly off if you did. RULE. FINDING MORE RIs WILL NOT TURN AN RR OR RS BACK ON. There is a danger signal in this. The pc’s RR or RS starts getting smaller, Item by Item, RI by RI, get off fast. Let the last RI be the last one looked for. If just one more is found, bang, no RR or RS on this pc no matter what is “found” in the way of RIs. 72 RULE: COMPLETING R2 OR R3 PACKAGE WILL NOT TURN ON THE RR OR RS. However don’t let the pc ARC Break on an incomplete list by starting one. It may be possible to find one more RI that gives a feeble slam, but then you’ve had it. However the picture is not all black. Pcs who were “incapable of RR or RS” have been subjected to 26 lists after with no RR or RS seen and still have recovered. RESTORING THE RR & RS The Rockslam and Rocket Read are brothers. A pc will Rockslam and yet not Rocket Read because the Rocket Read is the frailer brother. A pc going down hill toward no RR or RS first loses his RR. It now shows only as an RS. Then the RS vanishes too. You can’t Prepcheck an RS into an RR on some pcs if the pc is on the way down toward no RR or RS. Ordinarily, however, a lot of RSes can be Prepchecked into RRing if there is an RR there to fire. An RR as it expires may become an RS. The ability to RR, then, goes out first. There is only one thing that restores the pc’s ability to RR or RS. RULE. THE ONLY THING THAT WILL RESTORE THE ABILITY OF A PC TO RR OR RS IS TO FIND THE PC’S FIRST (or next) GPM GOAL. Naturally it is far easier to find a Rocket Read on a goal before the pc loses his ability to Rocket Read. It is far from impossible however to find a goal on a pc that is “incapable of RRing or RSing” and far from impossible to get it to RR by Prepcheck as the pc will always RR again on the right goal. Just listing goals eases the condition of “no RR or RS”. And once an RR or RS that has been shut off is found again on the goal, the pc’s RR or RS is “on again” on everything. On some pcs, the goal is so charged that you will find an immediate Rocket Firing"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Blow Down of the TA. You get long Rocket Reads one after another as the pc realizes it is the goal. This is particularly true on some pcs who have had a lot of RIs found. In such a case you no more find the goal and Prepcheck it than you have to find another for the next GPM. ALL ITEMS COUNT ANY ITEM found by 3DXX, 3GA, 3GAXX, or even earlier “for running processes on” are ALL part of the GPM and must be put on the pc’s Line Plot. It doesn’t matter how they were found or by whom, or if they were checked out or not. They belong on the Line Plot and can be used to find goals. RULE: PUT ANY ITEM EVER FOUND ON THE PC BY ANY PROCESS ON THE LINE PLOT. EVERY ONE WILL ADD UP TO A GOAL. 73 Therefore even “bad Items”, Items that were found from representing RSing Items, backwards oppose Items, all belong on the Line Plot. It is understood here that there was some kind of an assessment. Whatever was found by any kind of an assessment since 1954 belongs on the Line Plot and can be used to help find goals. FOUR RIs In R2- 10, 2- 12 and 2- 12A you are allowed only four RIs before the pc’s goal must bc found. If the RS or RR is seen to get smaller from one Item to the next, abandon 2- 12 and begin 3- M goal finding at once. When you find the pc’s goal, and when you are adding up and Prepchecking the first GPM, you will discover that everything found on the pc for the last nine years was part of his first or another GPM. So, old auditing paid off! In view of this, on old pcs, it’s safest to go for the goal as your first auditing action. You can use any Item ever found to help get that goal. On raw meat pcs get a couple Rls if you can by R2- 12 and use that to help find the goal. With luck one will even RR. But find the goal before opposing it. SUMMARY This discovery of what monitors the RS and RR of a pc is a very important one. I’ve worked ceaselessly on this since the first of the year and finally isolated it. Even a 3rd goal clear isn’t immune to losing his RS and RR if you keep finding scores of Items with no goal or a wrong goal. So treat the RS and RR with respect when found, and find the pc’s goal when he won’t RS or RR and you’ve got it made. You don’t need a better meter. Only the pc’s goal . This rules out unlimited R2- 10, 2- 12 and 2- 12A on a pc. But these give you the two or four RIs necessary for easy goal finding so R2 is of value after all! And I’ve a Prepcheck coming up that helps loosen up the pc’s goal, so we’re still all right."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":" L RON HUBBARD Founder 74 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 13 MARCH 1963 Issue II Central Orgs Missions THE END OF A GPM A Goals Problem Mass has an exact anatomy. It does not vary pc to pc except in significance. The mechanics are all the same. A full dissertation on the GPM exists on tapes. This is not a repeat of that data, although it corrects some of it. I wish to give you exactly what you need to know to pilot through a GPM with a pc. There are many GPMs. Four of them take one back about 20 trillion at a rough estimate. Some cover 2 1/ 2 trillion. Some as much, at a guess, as 15 trillion. The last one formed may be only partially formed and cover as little as 60,000 years. The first one encountered then, by the auditor, may be the least standard but only at its top. The bottom RIs of the first GPM will be standard. This is the old story of the hardest part of the case is the beginning. This is a standard GPM. The first GPM encountered is just the same but may be missing its top RIs (those closest to PT).

There may be more items, and in the first GPM you contact there may be less from the top down, but this synthetic plot will assist you in knowing what to do with your preclear. Note that the first oppterm in a complete GPM is the most likely to be a successful form of goal RI, and the first terminal at the top the least successful RI terminal of the goal. This will keep you from making errors in selecting out the first RI"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"you contact. RULE: THE FIRST TERMINAL CONTACTED WILL BE FOUND TO BE THE MOST DEGRADED FORM OF THE GOAL OF THAT GPM AND THE FIRST OPPTERM AN EXALTED FORM OF THE GOAL. Of course, in a first GPM that is not fully complete, the above rule may not hold true but this is an exception. A first oppterm found is usually a better expression of the goal even in the first GPM than the first terminal. In all subsequent GPMs (second, third, fourth) there are no exceptions to the above rule. It is very upsetting to the pc and the bank to oppose the first thing you find in a GPM wrong- way- to. Or to oppose any RI wrong- way- to for that matter. But even this doesn’t change the rules. Note that the RI HAPPY PEOPLE in the next GPM does not fit the goal TO SCREAM. The real time to get the next goal after TO SCREAM is when you have found HAPPY PEOPLE. If you go more than 4 RIs into the next GPM (after you saw TO SCREAM cease all reads) after the goal TO SCREAM, you are putting the pc in real danger as THE R/ S AND RR MAY SHUT OFF on the pc, thus making it very hard to find the next goal. However, if you try to find the next goal after TO SCREAM with the pc no further along than the RI A REPROVER in the above plot, you won’t find the next goal. The TA will go up to 5 and the pc will muddle about giving you goals (which won’t RR) out of the remaining (unfound) items of the goal TO SCREAM. If you find RIs into the next GPM after RI HAPPY PEOPLE without first finding its goal, not only will the pc’s ability to RR and R/ S eventually vanish (about 12 RIs later than RI HAPPY PEOPLE) but a goal oppose list done on TO SCREAM may give you the goal of the GPM two down from that of TO SCREAM and you will have skipped a whole GPM (the one with HAPPY PEOPLE at the top). Now, you’ve missed the goal of a whole GPM (although you have half its items), and my, won’t that poor pc ARC break. RULE: THE FURTHER THE PC GOES INTO A GPM WITHOUT THE GOAL, THE HARDER IT IS TO GET THE GOAL AND THE MORE LIKELY IT IS THAT YOU’LL GET THE NEXT GPM’S GOAL AND MISS THE GOAL OF THE GPM YOU HAVE ITEMS FOR. TROUBLE 77 What you can say with certainty is the more you depart from SOP 3M, the more trouble you’ll have. Don’t invite trouble by thinking and worrying too much. WORRY is the occupational hazard of the auditor doing 3M. The Worry Rule: RULE: SO LONG AS THE PC IS HAPPILY GOING ALONG AND YOU’RE FINDING GOALS AND RIs ON SCHEDULE, KEEP CALM. START WORRYING AND CORRECTING WHEN THE PC IS ARC BREAKY AND LOOKS BAD. Example: Auditor finds the RR on the list (on reading back to the pc) 5 items above the last RR marked on the list. There is no RR on the list after the RRing item found. Pc is happy with item found. It RRed. It was the last RR found on nulling. How the auditor saw an RR 5 items later is caused by the pc continuing to think about the one 5 above while he lists. The pc is actually representing the item the auditor finds. Hence it looks like a list item 5 down fired. There was no fire on the list item in nulling. What should the auditor do? Well, the pc is cheerful about the RRing item that was found. There is no RR on nulling after it. No other"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"item on the list now fires. So it’s the pc’s item, a bona fide RI. The above is excess worry. It will all come out all right as it follows the senior rules. But there is another extreme. Too little worry: Example: The auditor finds HAPPY PEOPLE in sequence on the above plot. The pc (out of pride) says that’s a terminal. The auditor carelessly lists it without any careful test. The pc starts looking black. The auditor keeps on going. The pc gets “flu.” The auditor plunges on without correcting the item, finds 4 more without a goal found, runs out of RR RIs (blank lists), does a goal oppose on TO SCREAM, lands in the GPM after next (beyond the one of HAPPY PEOPLE), runs out of all RRs and R/ Ses on the pc, can’t hold the pc in- session, pulls missed withholds and prepchecks. Pc and auditor together dive off highest bridge on “realizing 3M doesn’t work and case is hopeless.” (Joke.) The auditor didn’t start worrying when the pc started looking and feeling bad, kept adding more errors to an unhealed ARC Break and BANG! R2- 45. RULE: THE MORE YOU DO AFTER AN ARC BREAK OR PC UPSET WITHOUT CORRECTING THE EXACT REASON FOR THE UPSET, THE HARDER THE UPSET IS TO CORRECT. Routine 3M has a terrific wallop. Its ARC breaks are fantastic. When it starts to go wrong, stop and set it right. But if it isn’t going wrong, don’t try to set it right. Keep going. After you have done a few GPMs your heart will settle back into your chest and you’ll lose that hunted look. So for the auditor, the start of auditing 3M is the worst, as in the pc the start of the case is the worst. Fortunately, GPMs are carbon copies, with terrific precision of construction. Do one and you’ll have done the actions you’ll do on all. 78 So learn the rules right. And make Clears. WARNING Auditors who are not well trained make errors and then in failing, try to correct by inventing new rules and procedures. We have already had a “3M” where the RIs did not have to fire to be used. We have had several other brands. Remember this: a Clear is a Clear. The attainment of Clear lies on the other side of a GPM. Man has been unable to crack the riddle of the bank until now. We have the rules. 3M makes Clears. There are only about 20 errors you can make. There is only 1 path through the GPM. It has been found. The myth of one- shot Clear has been exploded. There is no easier way to Clear. So learn the rules well; don’t think you’ve found exceptions to the rules. You haven’t. Banks “got built” that way. Thetans are freed this way. Study 3M like you’ve never studied anything before. You can learn it. You can make Clears. You can be Clear. Who said it was easy? Man, it’s impossible! And has been for trillennia! And we can do it. The first of all the ages to understand and free the human spirit. So, get"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"busy. L.

It does not R/ S until somewhere around “Whatever might make a sound.” Before starting into the GPM a goal must RR. Do not take an R/ Sing goal as the goal. On prepchecking it, a goal that originally is found by R/ S will begin RR. In some cases the GPM item first contacted from a goal oppose list may not RR but R/ S. Delete the arrow from “The Goal to Scream” to “Happy People.” Extend arrow from “To Scream” to “Happy People.” Also the goal oppose list may have given “The Most Screamish” instead of “A Mute.” This is quite ordinary. If so, then the horizontal arrows throughout the plot would be pointing to the right in each case and the arrow from the “Goal Oppose List” would point to “The Most Screamish” instead of “A Mute.” And the diagonal arrows would go from the terms down to the left to the next oppterm. Which way these arrows face is of small importance so long as the line plot shows which RI came, on listing, from which RI. If you did not get an RI from an RI you listed or got one wrong way to, put all items found on the line plot anyway.

Leave all reliable items and goals already found by the original version of 3M on the line plot. Don’t invalidate the pc’s goals and items.

In repair, address the first GPM you contacted. l. CHECK OUT GOAL: Make sure it fires once in any three consecutive times read. (Or make sure a Class IV has seen it RR at sometime.) 2. OBTAIN CONDITIONAL TOP OPPTERM: (See line plot HCOB 13 Mar. 63.) DO NOT DO A GOAL- OPPOSE LIST TO START. (Abandon any goaloppose list you have done.) This is done by listing only this question with this wording: “WHO OR WHAT WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL?” (Pc knows what goal it is. Don’t name it in the question.) Do a relatively short list. List only until the question above no longer reads on the meter. Check the question for read about every five items. When it no longer ticks (make sure it isn’t ticking from Protest or Decided) add five more items. Test read it. If it still doesn’t tick, end list. If it does, continue list. Null this list by elimination, starting at the top of the list, calling each item three times and marking in or out, until only 1 or 2 are in."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":" Put in left- hand buttons on remaining items. One should now rocket read. That is your top oppterm RI. This source list is a source list. The reliable item may appear anywhere on it. (Consider all lists of 3M as source lists now. In R2- 12 RI oppose lists still exist.) This “most likely” list will probably be less than a hundred items long. It may be only 10 items long. If it’s longer, the question is being protested which makes the question read. 81 This gives you the top of the GPM, hitherto hard to get and usually missing in case repairs. (I had to get clever on this one. Everybody was missing the top of GPMs until case was repaired.) (Note: The exact listing rules for this “most likely” list will be published in a subsequent HCOB. Take whatever you get that is an unmistakable top oppterm [see line plot HCOB 13 Mar. 63 II, THE END OF A GPM where it is “The Most Screamish”]. Use it and go on with the following steps. After you find 3 or 4 RIs downwards, go back and see if the RI you found for top oppterm ticks when read to pc on meter. If it does now, don’t throw away the RIs you’ve just gotten. Just extend the “most likely” list and null what you extended. Take the RI you now find for top oppterm and use it as per steps below. You will find you are going up now higher in the GPM. Complete it upwards until you reach the real top of the oppterm column. Then resume with the former last RI lower in the GPM where you left off going down and continue to the bottom of the GPM exactly as in these steps below. The toughest part of the GPM to get is the top end, and as it’s the one most dramatized by the pc, it is the most important in his estimation. If you don’t get it all at the top, the pc will drag that mass down through the lower GPMs and things will be less real on the lower RIs and harder to find. The only time you will have difficulty is when a “few RI GPM” extends into present time up from the “first GPM” you contact. That means a goal above the “pc’s first goal.” You can also have trouble when this “most likely” listing system is used if the pc’s first GPM is only half lived through and has its top missing [never formed]. This will become apparent as the pc lists and tests will show you have a terminal. You can in such a case cope by using what you find but realizing you have a terminal on the “most likely list.” This is rare so don’t invite it. The status of a pc’s “first GPM” can be established by meter questions, “Do you have a goal closer to present time?” or “ above this?” If the pc’s first GPM [meaning the first one contacted by the auditor, always, not the earliest one on the track] is “truncated,” missing at the top, the remaining GPMs in the bank will still be of standard size and content. Even if you have trouble finding the top of a “truncated” GPM, still don’t do a goal- oppose list. If “most likely” doesn’t work on a truncated GPM, try a least likely version.) 3. COMPARE AND TEST RI: Note if getting RI blew down TA. Ask pc if this is the item, if it turns on more mass. Ask how it relates to the goal. Check goal for read. Read next question to pc as a terminal, then as an oppterm. Determine which one gives least mass and use that way of oppose. However, if this RI found in step (2) is anything but an oppterm you have bypassed an item or over- or underlisted or it’s not pc’s goal. Also, the “first GPM” can have been only partially formed and the top oppterm does not easily express the"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"goal, in which case you’ll get a terminal. If so, you’ll know by test. 4. OBTAIN CONDITIONAL TOP TERMINAL: Using question “Who or what would oppose (top oppterm just found)?” list. Check the question about every five items given. Immediately that it no longer ticks, add five more. Test RI and question again for tick. If it still doesn’t tick, null it. If it does, get five more, etc. 82 Null either by calling each item 3 times in sequence until only one is left and put in left hand buttons on it (Suppress, Careful of, Failed to Reveal), or by calling only the RRs seen on listing each one one time and put in left- hand buttons on it. As all lists in R3M are now all to be considered source lists, the former method is safer but harder on the pc. These are very short lists. All RI oppose lists are. They may be as small as 10 items, certainly seldom more than 20. Length is determined by the needle tick of the question (read to pc) vanishing. If you overlist you will miss an RI, err with a bypassed item, do the next one wrong way oppose and send the pc into another GPM! The whole error in listing is bypassing items by over- or underlisting. That the listing question ticks means the reliable item is not yet on the list or there are more items needed to discharge the tick. That the listing question ceases to tick means the reliable item is either on the list or will be in the next three or four given by the pc. 5. COMPARE AND TEST RI: Ask the pc if item turned on more mass. Ask pc if it’s the item. Ask pc if RI found opposes the one it was listed from. Ask pc how it relates to goal. Test RI for term or oppterm by asking next listing question one way and then the other. “ Who or what would oppose ? “ “ Who or what would ____ oppose?” The one that turns on the least mass is it. This is, however, a terminal and if it isn’t, the list you did to find it was a little too long or a little too short. Find an earlier RI on it or extend it for another RI. 6. OBTAIN NEXT OPPTERM: List “Who or what would (RI just found) oppose?” Null list by elimination or by RRs as above. Find RI. Always read the RI you are listing from and then the question you are listing on. Doing this jogs the question to read again when it might not. If the read won’t go off the RI you are listing from, it is surely arrived at after an RI has been bypassed. Redo the list it came off from."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":" 83 7. COMPARE AND TEST RI: Ask pc if RI turned on more mass. Ask pc if it’s pc’s item. Ask pc if RI is opposed by terminal it was listed from. Ask pc how RI relates to goal. Test goal.

Obtain RI. Test RI you’re listing from for a tick. 9. COMPARE AND TEST RI: Ask pc if RI turned on more mass. Ask pc if it’s pc’s item. Ask pc if RI opposes the one it was listed from. Ask pc how it relates to the goal. Read goal. Test RI for term or oppterm. It should be a terminal. 10. CONTINUE STEPS 6, 7, 8, 9 ABOVE IN SEQUENCE. 11. Toward bottom of the GPM, 20 or 30 (number is a guess) RIs from top, you will find (and this is not a guess) a terminal “Somebody or something with the goal (pc’s goal)” or “Somebody with the goal (pc’s goal).” There will be an oppterm, then “The goal (pc’s goal).” Then an oppterm. Then just the pc’s goal “To whatever.” This last RI is called “the goal as an RI.” There we stop all actions as above. The pc can know that these pat bottom GPM RIs exist. He can even be shown a model line plot. In a misguided enthusiasm the pc can put all of them on the list at once. Only the right one in sequence will RR, and if he’s been premature in putting them down 84 they won’t fire, so don’t worry about it. Just be sure you get those RIs. (See HCOB 13 Mar. 63 for the pattern.) 12. LIST FINAL LIST: When you definitely arrive honestly at “the goal as an RI” (“ To Scream,” “To Whatever,”) just the goal all by itself, you will find that although the goal has ceased to RR, this “goal as an RI” still has an RR on it. Now, the list we do from this is the final list of that GPM. And it works like the old goal oppose list. And it is the only place we now do a goal oppose list. It’s a long list. The only long list we now do. The list wording is exactly and only this “Who or what would (pc’s goal) oppose?” (Who or what would To Scream oppose?) We ignore any complaints from the pc that he or she can’t answer the question. Even hint there are some goals it might oppose as well as items. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"This is listed to fifty beyond the last RR or R/ S on the list and until the question no longer ticks. THIS LIST WILL HAVE ON IT THE NEXT GOAL WHEN COMPLETE. (And so, I found a way to give you the next goal without any fumbling.) It may be very long. It must have goals on it as well as items. Don’t do it until the line plot is complete. Or you’ll get an item off it, not a goal. 13. NULL THE FINAL LIST: Null by elimination. The RRs seen on listing will have no real bearing on the final RI, so don’t just read off the RRs. Chances are the final item (the goal) won’t RR while listing and won’t RR until the list is completely nulled. Find item. It should be a goal. The goal of the next GPM. 14. SMOOTH OUT LAST GPM: As soon as the goal of the next GPM is found, make sure it fires nicely but don’t get pc involved in it. Don’t start to find RIs in it yet. Or you’ll have to go on with next GPM and be trying to make an OT before you make a Clear! 15. INSPECT OLD LINE PLOT: Each GPM should have its own line plot. Make sure pc’s line plot is complete, particularly at the top. 16. INSPECT RIs: 85 Read over each RI on old line plot to see if one ticks. INCLUDE THOSE ON THE PLOT THAT OBVIOUSLY BELONG TO SOME OTHER GPM. If one is found ticking, take the list off which it came (not the list listed from it) and renull it or extend it somewhat and renull. A new heretofore missing RI will turn up. Oppose it gently (short list) and in short, do steps 6, 7, 8, 9 on it (depending for sequence on whether it’s a terminal or an oppterm) until the RR vanishes. Be careful not to leap into a new GPM by overlisting or opposing backwards. (Wrong- way oppose lands you in a different GPM usually.) If during inspection you find a firing RI on the line plot rocket reading even though it was opposed, the rule in the above paragraph still applies. It was backwards oppose. BUT, the fault is that an RI was bypassed on an earlier list. Find the bypass and oppose it. In this patch up (or patching up a GPM done by earlier versions) you will find a list, even though RRs were seen on listing, suddenly fail to give up an RI. That’s usually because the RI is already found. The list has been tied back into the already existing RIs. PUT EVERYTHING YOU FIND RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY ON THE LINE PLOT. THEY’RE ALL THE PC’s ITEMS.

No danger, only discomfort and more frequent ARC breaks attend the condition where the auditor tried to make an OT before making a Clear. Just do the goal with the biggest read, complete its plot, but don’t find RIs in a new goal found from it, and work around as you can in the old mess until each GPM is complete. 17.

To repair R3M2 (when you run out of RIs suddenly) the rule is to find the item on the line plot that reacts on the meter, renull or extend the list it came from and locate the bypassed item and proceed with that as though you hadn’t found anything else. _____________ If you encounter an RI that, given to the pc, turns on more mass, extend or renull the list it came from and get another RI that doesn’t. But don’t be too harsh with this rule. Some RIs do turn on a bit more mass, particularly when the top of a GPM has not been found. _____________ If you find an RI that doesn’t belong in this GPM, put it on the line plot. Realize it came from a wrong- way oppose. See if the list the RI you just opposed came from doesn’t have a bypassed item on it. If so, don’t bother to right- way oppose the RI you wrong- way opposed. Use the earlier RI and go on. 87 The reason you can’t find an RI on a list even though you saw RRs on listing is because the RI for that list has already been found, or your list is just a trifle short. If you suddenly find no RRs seen on listing a list, an earlier item was wrong, bypassed or wrong- way opposed. Locate and go on. If RR on items is getting smaller, beware of having a wrong goal, or having gone into a GPM you have no goal for. Don’t find more RIs until you find what’s wrong. Only finding RIs for which you have no goal will shut off the RR and R/ S. Finding the goal for them will turn the RR and R/ S back on. _____________ If you have to put a question mark after the list RRs and R/ Ses, you are nulling with too low a sensitivity setting. Put up the sensitivity until you can see what’s happening. Or get one of the new listing meters. _____________ If a pc cognites on an item as you list and it RRs (it must RR to be an RI), say “Very good.” Test the question for a read. If the question is clean, read the item to the pc to make sure it RRs. If the question still reads say, “I’m sure you’re right. However, give me a few more so I can get the tick off this question.” Do so, test the question and read the pc the RI. If it doesn’t read, put left- hand buttons in on it. If it still doesn’t read, find the one that does. Pc won’t ARC break unless you give him an item that doesn’t RR. _____________ There are no bonus packages in R3M.

To avoid bypassed items consider every list a source list, the RI can appear anywhere on it. Considering them all source lists ensures your finding the RI that should RR and in sequence. _____________ The main danger in R3M is not wrong- way oppose. You can tell that fairly easily. The danger lies in bypassing RIs. The way these get bypassed is to overlist or underlist. _____________ 88 If the RR seen on consecutive RIs found is getting smaller as you find more, you have the wrong goal for the GPM you’re in. Either get into the right GPM or, less preferably, find the goal of the one you’re working. You can only get into the wrong GPM by having a wrong goal in the first place or by bypassing RIs, resulting in opposing an RI wrong way to and getting thrown into another GPM, or by moving down into the next GPM after the old goal has ceased to tick. _____________ A goal RR improves as you find successive RIs, right up to the moment it begins to occasionally R /S and RR, as marked on the line plot of HCOB 13 Mar. 63. If a goal doesn’t read better on the meter after you find the top oppterm and terminal, there’s something wrong with that goal. If the goal was wrong and the RIs you found did RR, use the oppterm to list goals from and the terminal to list goals against. “What might be the goal of (oppterm)?” and “What goal would (terminal) be an overt against?” _____________ Watch overshooting into the GPM below the one you should be working in. You can miss the low RIs (“ Somebody with the goal,” etc.) and plow on into the GPM below it without its goal. After a dozen or so RIs without having the goal, the pc’s ability to R/ S and RR will shut off, to be restored only when the goal for them is found. _____________ Tell your pc the best way in the world to commit thetancide is to self- audit or selflist on R3M, or to dope the line plot in advance. If the pc thinks of goals or items out of session, make the pc write them down and bring the list in. But discourage it. _____________ I saw the troubles you were having and have been researching swiftly to remedy it with a more positive version of R3M. It’s getting simpler. It can’t get much easier.

RON HUBBARD Founder"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":" 89 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 6 APRIL 1963 Central Orgs Missions R3M2 WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IN CLEARING The final object of the auditor in clearing is: TO FIND GOALS AND RELIABLE ITEMS UNTIL ALL GOALS AND RELIABLE ITEMS HAVE BEEN FOUND AND EACH GPM IS COMPLETE AND ALL GPMs ARE DISCHARGED. Now, there are many ways to do this, but finding and discarding the pc’s RIs is not one of them. The more you get hold of RIs and say “That’s not it” the more miserable your pc will feel and the less clearing you’ll get done. You can actually fumble and grope and get wrong RIs and fall on your head but if you continue to get RIs and put them on the line plot the pc will eventually get them all. The length of time it takes to make a multi- goal Clear does not depend upon the care with which RRing RIs are found, it depends upon the number of RRing RIs and goals found. Only the comfort of the pc depends upon the care with which RRing RIs are found. It is a mechanical proposition. There is just so much charge on a case. The case recovers when the charge is released. “Charge” is manifested on the E- Meter in the rocket reads contained in goals and their RIs. Charge vanishes when RIs are found and paired. If you understand this, much will come plain to you. The idiocy of giving the pc an item that doesn’t RR lies in the fact that it doesn’t bleed off charge, not that it will soon lead to an ARC break. The question is only: How many reliable items and goals can be found on this case? Not how much time can be spent repairing the case. A smooth run to Clear would consist of the auditor finding the exact top of a GPM, running out the exact RIs in it, getting the next goal and prepchecking the goal of the bank just cleared, all by 3M2. But with auditors and the pcs green (and worried), is this ideal always obtainable? The answer is, I am afraid, No. The following is far more likely to be the case: A goal is found. A lot of RIs are run out of its GPM. The next goal is found. It is discovered then that half the RIs found in the old bank belonged in this new bank. The new goal is run and many RIs are found. The auditor then finds the 3rd goal and many RIs in it. The auditor now discovers the top of the first bank was missing and goes back to find it. He does so and discovers a goal above the “first goal.” He finds it and gets RIs in it. Then to his horror finds there is a bank two above the “first bank” found. He finds that goal and gets RIs in it and discovers the pc’s present time. He also finds that everything the pc was groaning about is contained in the bank that was closest to present time. He cleans this up and then goes back down to discover that although the goals of the lower banks no longer read, he had never found half the"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"RIs in any one of them. He remedies this and only then, in succeeding banks, finds he can smoothly carry on, cleaning up each GPM fully as he goes. 90 There is nothing wrong with this. When we had R2- 12 it worked well. Then we got 2- 12A and wasted fantastic amounts of time repairing 2- 12, and we had few gains to show for it. It’s the same with 3M and 3M2. The pc is far from comfortable with the auditor battering around missing GPMs and goals. The pc will swear he’d rather be dead. But the message is, he’ll get Clear if they keep at it on the basis of finding RIs and goals as they can. And there’ll come a day when the pc will really shine. Do a perfect clearing job if you can. If you can’t, just find goals and RIs and just keep going and you’ll still achieve the same end. The error is not to find lots of RRing RIs and goals per unit of auditing time. Keep your records well. Just barrel along. Sounds barbarous and you’ll have to get used to ARC breaks but the point is, clearing can be done that way. Clearing can’t be done by finding an RI, getting nervous about it, abandoning it, finding another RI, abandoning it, fooling around whole sessions trying to find the top of a GPM when a whole panorama of RIs exist lower down. Find goals and RIs! Get the GPM as complete as you can but not at the expense of not finding RIs. Yes it sounds barbarous, and it is, but it works. Remember, you’ll have ARC breaks. Assess for why, repair it and keep going. These are the only rules you must not violate: 1. AN RI MUST (A) RR, (B) CAUSE A TA BLOWDOWN AND (C) TURN ON A MINIMUM OF MASS. 2. IF YOU FIND MORE THAN A DOZEN RIs WHICH DON’T MATCH THE GOAL YOU’RE WORKING ON, THE PC’S RR AND R/ S WILL SHUT OFF. 3. PRECISE, LEGIBLE RECORDS AND LINE PLOTS MUST BE KEPT. 4. IF THE PC ARC BREAKS DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT AND REPAIR WHAT YOU FIND. DON’T DO WHAT THE PC SAYS. TAKE THE PC’S DATA BUT ACT ONLY AFTER AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT. 5. DON’T PREPCHECK A GOAL UNLESS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ALL THE RIs IN THAT GPM AND HAVE DONE THE FINAL GOAL OPPOSE LIST TO THE NEXT GPM. 6. A LIST MUST BE LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE ONLY ONE RR ON NULLING AND NO R/ S. IT MUST BE SHORT ENOUGH NOT TO BYPASS ITEMS. IT MUST BE LONG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE NEEDLE CLEAN ON NULLING. IT MUST BE SHORT ENOUGH NOT TO GET A DIRTY NEEDLE THROUGH PROTEST AND COLLAPSED MASS. Now just how you list or find goals or repair is a broader study, all stemming from the above. When you gain experience you’ll be able to come closer to perfect. Meanwhile don’t stall around nervously. Find goals and RIs. Learn to find an RI every 30 minutes of auditing time. And then improve that speed. There is a certain exact quantity of charge on a case. It’s contained in goals and RIs. Every goal you find deducts from that quantity. Every RI you find and oppose"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"deducts from that quantity. The more accurately you do it, the less time you’ll waste on ARC breaks and fumbling. 91 Accuracy itself is only important because it saves auditing time. But accuracy can become a vice which gives one no goals or RIs found. I know I have said “Do it right.” That’s fair enough. But I’m now saying “Do it as right as you can but do it.” At the start of his case the pc hasn’t a clue. Therefore he lists longer. His confront is at its poorest. Therefore he fails to list the obvious. A green auditor on 3M2 does not really believe it is all as pat as made out. Therefore he always thinks the pc is different. Eventually both auditor and pc get the “hang” of the bank. They learn that the bottom five RIs on “To Catch Catfish” will be “A Catfish Catcher,” “Somebody with the goal To Catch Catfish,” “Somebody or something with the goal to Catch Catfish,” “The Goal To Catch Catfish” and “To Catch Catfish” (the goal as an RI). Only what each opposes is variable. They learn that the top terminal will be something like “Somebody Who Can’t Catch Catfish.” And that the three highest oppterms from the top down will probably be “Catfish Catchers,” “Catching Catfish” and “People Who Catch Catfish.” And they know that there may be RIs, term or oppterm, in this goal like, “Catching Catfish,” “The Inability to Catch Catfish,” “People who won’t Catch Catfish,” etc. And they know then that only the low oppterms and the middle ground are in serious question. Give the auditor and pc the next goal and they’ll list away as usual but directly at what should be there. And it goes like a whirlwind. Early on, without this experience, both auditor and pc grope, overlist, fumble about. So the first GPM run has the longest lists and the most errors. Clearing is not easy on the pc. It’s not easy on a new auditor. And there will be times when both rue the day they ever got into the GPM. But if they keep going, finding goals and their RIs, faint streaks of pre- dawn gray will begin to gleam ahead and then, with perseverance, day will break upon a higher plateau than man has ever dreamed of before. The mystics spoke of the Abyss. They said that in trying to cross it, many fell into the darkness. Without knowing it, they spoke of the Goals Problem Mass. The Buddhists spoke of Nirvana. Without knowing it, they spoke of vanishing forever into the GPM (Nirvana). They had become completely overwhelmed, lacking meters and a map. We are Scientologists. We won’t fall into the abyss. And we won’t join Nirvana. We have meters and a map. We know the rules and the way. This is the greatest adventure of all time. Clearing. The way is strewn with the skeletons and skulls of those who have tried over the past trillenia. The bottom of the Abyss is glutted with failures. Nirvana is choked with the overwhelmed. To say it is not a dangerous way would be false. But it is not dangerous if you keep going, finding goals and RIs, reducing the charge on the case, handling the ARC breaks as they occur. Only the fainthearted will add any bones to the Abyss or"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"apathy to Nirvana. We are Scientologists. We have won. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 92 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 8 APRIL 1963 Central Orgs Missions URGENT ROUTINE 3M- 2 LISTING AND NULLING (Corrects HCOB 6 Apr. 63, R3- M2) The most likely list (“ Who or what would be most likely to achieve this goal?”) for thefirst GPM contacted is proving to be longer on most pcs than was expected. List this list by the rules of the old goal- oppose source list, which is to say 50 items past the last RR or R/ S. You will find that on subsequent goals the list is shorter, but it still must be complete, 50 past last RR or R/ S. A list is as long as it has to be to have a clean needle and only one RR on the list. On the most likely list at the beginning and the goal- oppose list at the end of the GPM (done after it is complete) the 50 past the last RR and R/ S serves best. The RR can be anywhere on a source list. When you X out an item in nulling, be sure the item did not react on the needle. To do otherwise is dishonest in the extreme. X means no reaction on needle. Overlisting causes a dirty needle through Protest and Decide. Underlisting causes a dirty needle and lots of items to react. There are then, still 2 kinds of lists for each GPM: 1. The source list. 2. The RI oppose list. There are only two of these “source lists.” a. The “most likely list” at the start of each GPM, done before any RIs are found and b. “The goal as an RI oppose list” at the bottom of the GPM, done after all the RIs of the GPM are found. 93 The “most likely list” results (if completed) in a high oppterm of the GPM. From this the remaining RIs are found."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":" IT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO DO A “MOST LIKELY” LIST IF YOU CAN GET THE TOP OF THE GPM BY DOING “RI OPPOSE LISTS” FROM WITHIN THE GPM ITSELF; A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN SECOND AND ONWARD GPMs. The “goal as an RI oppose” list at the bottom is done only after all the RIs in the GPM are found. It results in finding the goal of the next GPM. Between these two are the “RI oppose lists.” The two “source lists” are long, 50 items past the last RR or R/ S, and the RI will be anyplace on them, usually an item that did not RR when listed but RRs on nulling. The “RI oppose lists” are relatively short. They tend to be longer in the first and second GPMs than in later ones. But they are never very long. They go perhaps 20, 30 items in the first GPM, fewer in the second, as few as 5 or 10 in the third and remaining GPMs. The “RI oppose lists” are listed until neither the RI being listedfrom or the question tick. This is the actual listing rule. Just list and test the RI being listed from and the question frequently (about every 5 items). You can add 5 for good measure or not. Overlisting an “RI oppose list” tends to bypass RIs. Underlisting tends to bypass RIs. It is perfectly all right, on an overlisted list to take an earlier RR than the last one seen on listing. Sometimes the pc overlists and “goes around the corner” to the next RI. This is particularly true in later GPMs. Then you have the actual RI earlier than the last RR. It is more usual, however, to extend the list a bit when this happens, as the pc will put the first RI back on, now after the “next RI.” The “next RI” will not now RR and only the pc’s actual RI will RR. Sometimes pcs argue and get ARC broke when their RI “occurs earlier than the last RR.” This, however, is an infallible sign of an incomplete list. It needs two or three even, non- reading items to complete it and the pc will put back his insisted- upon RI which now is the last RRing item on the list. In all listing, nulling and taking RRing items off any list, a certain amount of judgment is required. It can’t all be machinelike. But that judgment doesn’t include two RRs or one RR and one R/ S firing at the same time on a list, nor does it include giving the pc an item that “read once on Careful Of,” nor does it include not trying to get the right RI. A skillful auditor becomes an adept pilot in listing, nulling, finding the pc’s RI and giving it to the pc. And in learning to become one, an auditor makes mistakes. That’s okay. You’ll also invent some shortcuts. That’s okay, too, as you’ll soon find that dropping the safety factors costs you more auditing time than you save and that the innovations 94 introduced come hard against the unalterable rules of listing and nulling. Then you’ll be happy to do it right, do it well and pick up a speed that will list a whole later GPM in a single session. All by the rules. DOPE- OFF AND HARD LISTING "},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"If the pc dopes off while listing, it’s a missed withhold. However, the missed withhold can also be that the question or item being listed from is wrong or the item is not on the list. If a pc doesn’t list brightly and easily on any list, the pc has missed withholds or has Protested or Decided out. Or is being listed on a wrong question or from a wrong item. Always try to pull missed withholds first if a pc dopes off or isn’t listing well. Consider the 3M mechanics that might be causing the dope- off second. If you’re listing an RI wrong- way- to, however, the trouble is more than boiloff. The pc just can’t do it without being whipped. So don’t force a pc to list. Find out why he can’t. NULLING LISTS The two “source lists” are nulled by elimination. Say the item three times, mark it in or out. When the end of the list is reached, go back over the items left in. Go over all items on the list, not just those that RRed. The RI you find will seldom have RRed on listing on a “source list.” The item you will find possibly didn’t RR when listed. If a “source list” is complete, it looks like this on nulling: A CATFISH X A TIGER RR X A WATERBUCK / X A WILLOW WAND X A GAME WARDEN X THE WIND / RR If a “source list” is incomplete, not only will the needle be dirty but it nulls like this: A CATFISH /////// X A TIGER RR ////// X A WATERBUCK /// X A WILLOW WAND X A GAME WARDEN //////// X THE WIND ///////////// You must not have more than one R/ S or RR on any list (source or RI oppose). This is invariable. If you find an RR on a source list, you need only go on until you are sure there is no other RR or R/ S on the list before giving the pc THE item. 95 Nulling the “RI oppose list” is entirely different. The best system is: l. Tell pc you’re going to read last R/ S (if any) on list and do so. It must not R/ S or RR. If it does, continue list. 2. Tell pc you’re going to read the next- to- the- last rocket reading item on list. Do so. If it RRs, continue list. 3. Tell pc you’re going to read the last rocket reading item on list. Do so. If it RRs, say “That rocket reads.” If it doesn’t RR, read the items above and below. Go up as high as five items and down as many. If still no RR, read earlier RRs on list. If still no RR, null the whole list by elimination. If still no RR, retest reliable item it’s listedfrom. If it reacts, extend list until it doesn’t react. Repeat above numbered steps. If you still can’t get an instant, easily found RR, examine earlier RRs. If one ticks, the list from which it came must be extended. On an “RI oppose list” you almost never put ruds in on an item to make it fire. When no RR fires without coaxing, the list is either over- or underlisted. If overlisted, find an earlier item that DRs on nulling and put in the three left- hand buttons on it, Suppress, Careful Of, Fail to Reveal. However, overlisting is"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"rarer than you’d think, and treat it as an underlist until it gets to looking long and pc is getting edgy. If still no RR appears on reading to pc, go back and find an earlier RI that ticks and extend the list it came off from. RRs on an “RI oppose list” should fire off right now the moment read with no BMRs. Factually, doing “RI oppose lists” is a piece of cake, a walk in the park. You should get an RI every seven minutes in the fourth or fifth GPM including administration and session actions if you’re going well. In doing “source lists” you should get an RI off one, listing and nulling, in about three hours in the third or fourth GPM. All the rules of listing the GPM are known. Any variation in how they’re set forth in HCO Bulletins comes from observing auditors having trouble, or possible shortcuts. All rules given about listing in any HCO Bulletin are true. The only question has been how does one accomplish them. The above version of R3M- 2 Listing and Nulling will be found very rapid. Only the RI oppose lists require alertness and some care. Auditors are making, as a general comment, far, far, far more trouble in running a GPM than is there to be had. L.

Different goal types (be, do, have) have slightly different three top oppterms. A “To be Condition” goal has a “Condition,” “Being Condition” and “People Who are Condition,” in that order. The first six terminals from the bottom never vary except as to significance of the goal. (The fifth and sixth sometimes change places but all else is constant.) The top three terminals vary a bit more but are quite similar to the examples given. There are other similarities between these banks given and other GPMs but they are not as fixed and invariable. An auditor should be able to look at a goal and know at once and exactly its three top oppterms, its first six terminals and have a good idea of the three top terminals. The remainder of the RIs of the goal will be much more variable. "},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"THE CROSSOVER The area in the center of a GPM is the crossover. This means the RIs which cause the pc to become an opponent of his own goal. In at least one term and oppterm, the reason for the shift of attitude is plain. Pcs most easily find the crossover and are liable to try to give the crossover of some other GPM if you bypass an RI in the one you’re working. The usual “How does this RI relate to ‘To ‘ ” test is almost always adequate, however. The crossover is only important as a guide as to whether or not you are still in the GPM. Otherwise the middle items are not easily detected as belonging to the goal. THE RELATIONSHIP OF GOALS Only the first goal on the whole track is postulated without reason. Contrary to what we earlier believed, all other goals are closely related. A pc’s goals, listed out in chronological order, first on the track to the one in PT (first 102 goal contacted), give a story. This makes it easy to locate consecutive goals once you’re in the GPMs. The arrows above give the optimum order with which to find items. The banks are lived in reverse order to the arrows above. There are many more RIs to an actual GPM than those given above, particularly later on the track (closer to PT). I have given here just essential RIs which show the ones always there, the crossover and the general picture. Given these plots, if your pc just can’t seem to get the top of a bank, and “most likely lists” are difficult, get him to figure out the top oppterm from these plots or, more crudely, give it to him and let him work with it until you find the RRing top oppterm. Don’t waste time in clearing. After the third or fourth bank the pc will be listing by plot anyway. Behavior of the goal is given for only one plot but is similar in all line plots. L.

The pattern is probably completly correct but there may be a transposition or adjustment necessary, such as the way “NO” is expressed - Not- non- absence etc. By evidence to hand, all GPMs contain all these early and late endings. It is permissable (indeed imposible to do otherwise) for the pc to list this pattern to hand and the auditor must use it to help the pc. No pc is ever going to confront the whole of a GPM early in processing. RR markings refer to how goal reads on being called 3 times to pc. All RIs read with RR when called to pc once.

The terminals decrease as lived until goal is repugnant. Each Terminal and each oppterm contains a form of the goal. There are neither terminals nor oppterms that contain entirely different words. The lower terminals have no slightest variation in any bank. The upper oppterms contain no slightest variation from the pattern in any bank. Only the middle ground of the GPM may vary but always has some form of the goal itself. If you make an error in following this pattern or fail to get the right RI your pc’s RR will get shorter and vanish on the next 3 or 4 RIs. This is for a verb goal such as “To Scream”. It is also the same for a “To Be” goal form. This will hold good for all goals and all GPMs. Any corrections and patterns for other goal forms will be released as fast as I find them. I do not guarantee there are not more RIs in a GPM. The following is the goal from which the above pattern was taken, given to assist further understanding. TO CREATE Found April 14, 1963 All items found April 15, 1963 LINE PLOT "},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"106 L. RON HUBBARD LRH: jr Copyright © 1963 by L. Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 107 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 18 APRIL AD 13 Central Orgs Missions URGENT ROUTINE 3M2 DIRECTIVE LISTING DIRECTIVE LISTING is defined as that Routine 3 activity which directs the pc’s attention while listing to the form of the inevitable reliable item, providing it can be predicted. This is a new departure in Scientology auditing. It could be a dangerous one if carried into directing goals or Routine 2- 12 RIs. It applies therefore only to the inevitable reliable items to be found in Routine 3 line plots. It is so much more upsetting to the pc and clearing to miss the right RI that the practice is excused. Indeed it must be done. The law governing this is: A PC’S ABILITY TO CONFRONT IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE REMOVED FROM THE GPMs; THE PC’S ABILITY TO CONFRONT IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF CONFRONTING DONE IN A GPM. There are only a few things to be careful of in directive listing: 1. That the charge (if any) of the question being listed from is also listed off even when the right item has been directed on to the list; 2. That the auditor does not let himself be persuaded out of getting the right RI on the list; 3. That the directed RI does actually fire with an RR when called regardless of mid ruds or TD; 4. That the directed RI is the right RI for that list; 5. That that part of the line plot not common to all cases may not be directed on to a list by the auditor. Definitions: A directed reliable item is one guided on to the list by the auditor. It is one derived from the form of the GPM common to all cases. _____________ HOW TO DIRECT LISTING The auditor knows that in every GPM (except truncated ones which, being the 1st GPM from present time, may have the top missing) the majority of the RIs are common to"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"all GPMs. (See HCO Bulletin of 17 April 1963, A COMPLETE GPM PATTERN, and subsequent line plots.) Most of these, particularly top and bottom groups, never change. Therefore the auditor, with the pc’s help, determines what the inevitable RIs should be, confirms it with the meter, gets the charge off the question by getting some more items on the list and gives the pc the right RI for that point in the bank or works with the pc to obtain that exact RI. 108 The first command that starts a new GPM being audited is: “Give me the ultimate achievement of your goal in a noun form.” Get several of these nouns. One will consistently RR. That’s the pc’s RI. Give it to the pc. Do not overlist. Do not compromise with these rules. The top terminal is then gotten by the question “Who or what would oppose (noun form you just got).” Get the right one by suggesting its probable form to the pc. Get the charge off the question. Do not overlist. (You must stop pc’s listing on RI oppose lists and check the question.) You then go through the proper 3M2 steps for tests, etc. Give pc the right top terminal that has been found. List “Who or what would (top terminal) oppose?” Suggest it to the pc as it is known. Make sure the 2nd top oppterm gets on the list. Etc., etc. _____________ THE PROBLEM If you don’t select for the pc the inevitable RIs as you list them, the chances of the pc getting them in the first 3 GPMs is so remote as to be nonexistent. The pc will go through agony if they’re missed, and you’ll lose his or her RR as this is the roughest part of the GPM. Further, their undischarged mass will be carried down into all additional auditing and the pc will not lose the mass and may gain weight. And you’ve set the stage for ARC breaks galore. Further this gives you the rightness of the goal at once with no mess- up of the pc by reason of long listing. (If the obvious top oppterm isn’t there it either isn’t the goal or is a truncated GPM). _____________ DIRECTING RIs An auditor must become expert at preselecting RIs for any given goal. Study HCOB 17 Apr. 63, A COMPLETE GPM PATTERN, and subsequent issues. [Editor’s Note: HCOB 17 Apr. 63 A COMPLETE GPM PATTERN was cancelled by HCOB 23 Apr. 63 R3 -M2 . ] If the pc ARC breaks or starts getting a dirty needle after you’ve given him a selected RI, you’ve bypassed one. But pcs will protest their top terminal quite often as discreditable. So it’s discreditable. Does it RR and discharge the top oppterm? If so, it’s the pc’s. Give it to the pc and the pc will cognite and the TA will blow down. If it’s still wrong, you’ll soon run out of RR as you find more RIs. There are no GPM RIs above the top terminal or oppterm as shown on line plots for"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"any given GPM. But there may be another full GPM. A recently, only partly formed GPM has no top. If a GPM has its top complete, there’s probably another goal above it (nearer present time). L. RON HUBBARD Founder 109 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 23 APRIL 1963 Missions ROUTINE 3M2 HANDLING THE GPM Goals Problem Masses may be handled in several ways. The only things that establish the best way are: l. Speed of finding RIs. 2. Accuracy of RIs found. 3. Completeness of GPM’s RIs. 4. Correct order of RIs. 5. Pc’s morale. 6. Easiness of the method on the pc. 7. Ease of handling by the auditor. 8. Resulting state of Clearness of the pc. Immediately discounted then are those methods which put speed of finding RIs second, for it will be found that the slower you find RIs, the more the remaining factors above will suffer. I have been over or through, as a pc, almost any method of auditing a GPM there could be, and the one factor that stands out to me, both as an auditor and a pc, as well as a Case Supervisor, is that idling about trying to get it all now results in the destruction of both auditor and pc morale and consumes unrewarding session time. Why? The law that covers this is: A PC’S ABILITY TO CONFRONT IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE REMOVED FROM THE GPMs; THE PC’S ABILITY TO CONFRONT IS NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMOUNT OF CONFRONTING DONE IN A GPM. This is a very important rule. In practice it means, “Get all the RIs you can discharged as fast as you can.” It also could mean “Get all the GPMs discharged as fast as you can.” But if this last means discharging partially many GPMs it ceases to be true as the pc will go into hopeless confusion in the remaining charge. It does mean: l. Discharge the GPM you are working on as fast as you can, regardless of skipping "},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"some RIs, regardless of reaching the top first. 110 2. Don’t keep scrapping RIs found just because there may be some higher than those you are finding (later). 3. Don’t let the pc flounder hopelessly in some area of the GPM that can’t be gotten just yet. 4. Keep a line plot of each block of RIs you find. Join them up later. You have a pattern. You will be able to follow it easily most of the time. But where you cannot get the pattern to go right, jump to another lower part of the pattern where it will go right and go on with it. You will find it isn’t the wrongness of the pattern that gives you trouble. It’s the inability of the pc to confront. Answer: remove charge. Because the pc ARC breaks on missed RIs, tell the pc “We’re going to miss some items. Those already found are valid. We’re going to get some lower ones and get the charge off and then come back for what we’ve missed.” The pc won’t ARC break. On the contrary his morale will increase in most cases. And then, of course, with the GPM shot full of holes, the pc can confront better. And the second pass through the GPM will get some of the missing ones. And the third pass will assemble the lot. The only things to avoid are getting the pc confused by too many shifts and dizzy through invalidation of existing RIs already found. The rules for this method of handling are these: l. Always start at the top or as close to the top as you can and go down (earlier in time) through the GPM. This is true for every pass through the GPM. 2. Don’t let the pc flounder endlessly searching. If it seems all you can do is flounder, go lower to another known part (by pattern) of the bank and get going again. 3. Realize that the final pass through will find all RIs RRing again as they are put in proper order on the final line plot. The RR travels from top oppterm to top terminal and right on down to the “goal as an RI” terminal. This RR has to be passed through the complete, finished bank as the last action of assembly of the final line plot. (Even though they RR again when put in their right places, they are mostly discharged by the original finding.) 4. Use all sections found already as blocks of RIs. Don’t try to find them again. The RR has to be passed through them as they are joined up and they may get corrected, but don’t throw away sections found. 5. The pc suffers from CHARGE on the bank, not from significance of RIs. Significance gives the details of the aberration but its magnitude is established by charge. 6. It can be assumed that two fast passes through a GPM and a final assembly pass will do more to clear the GPM than one painfully slow, fumbling pass, where the pc’s efforts are always getting invalidated. 111 "},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"7. All RIs must RR when found or no charge comes off. (See note below.) 8. The pattern of a GPM is used throughout to help guide the pc. 9. Do not redo a block of RIs already found until the whole GPM has been covered at least once through. _____________ HANDLING THE GOALS PROBLEM MASSES You will almost never get the GPM that is nearest PT as the pc’s first goal found. This goal is usually the most offerable goal by its own wording. Very secret or very blatantly offerable type wordings are found first, forced into view by their top terminals or oppterms. Therefore, do not assume ever that the pc’s first goal is the PT goal. It almost never is. The actual PT area goal contains all the pc’s hidden standards and chronic present time problems. Therefore one must attain and run it eventually before getting earlier track goals. Rule: A GPM which has its top oppterm and terminal is rarely the PT GPM. Thus these steps apply: 1. Run the goal you first find on the pc if it’s a right goal (has a GPM). 2. Clean it up very carefully as per this or later HCO Bulletins. 3. Do not oppose the final “goal as an RI” RI at the bottom of the bank (“ What goal would (goal) oppose?”). Leave that RI firing. 4. Leave the lowest (lst bottom) oppterm of the goal with whatever RRs. Do not adjust it as you will eventually have to. (It depends on the next lower goal which remains unknown at this time.) 5. Leave the lower (earlier) GPM strictly alone for now, regardless of pc’s interest in it. 6. Do the top source list of the GPM you have just run “What goal would oppose (goal whose GPM you ran).” 7. Find the next GPM (closer to PT) goal. 8. Handle completely the later GPM as per this HCO Bulletin or later advices. 9. Do a “What goal would oppose (one you just handled)?” 10. Handle GPM found. 11. Eventually by this method find the PT GPM and handle it fully. 12. When you are completely certain you have the PT GPM (pc’s current life name or person is part of it and its top may be missing- truncated) and have handled it fully, trace back through all RIs and earlier banks found and only then prepcheck these goals as you complete them on the way down. "},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"112 13. Reach eventually the first goal ever found on the pc but not handled. Do its RI oppose list and find the earlier goal. Adjust the bottom RI of the first goal ever found on the pc. Prepcheck the goal. 14. Handle the next earlier GPM (for which you have just found the goal) fully as per this HCO Bulletin or later advices. 15. Continue earlier and earlier in the GPMs, handling each one fully before getting the next until you reach Time Zero for GPMs. DO NOT CONTINUE to go earlier with GPMs until you have handled everything up to PT. Avoid even finding the goal of the earlier GPM (step 3 above) until you are ready to run that whole GPM. The charge on early GPMs is fantastic and the more GPMs unhandled later on the track (nearer PT) the harder it is on the pc to go into earlier (further from PT) GPMs. The pc drags the P. T GPM and others near it that have not been run through earlier GPMs if they are prematurely handled. The method is summed by: 1. Get a goal. 2. Handle the bank of the goal you get. 3. Get to PT GPM by GPM, handling each as you go. 4. Smooth and prepcheck goals on the way down. 5. Then head for the earlier track. Violations of this method will account for any casualties suffered in running R3. Violations will occur as the whole pressure of the pc’s interest is on earlier track and pc’s sell hard to handle the earlier banks. But whatever the sales talk, it is very hard on the pc and auditor to go into GPMs earlier on the track than the first goal found before later GPMs are all handled and fully discharged. The pc, finding himself with the earlier goal found in violation of Step 3 above of the 15 Steps will be so interested in it that he or she will try to move heaven and auditors to run it, not to go forward toward PT. Auditors unable to find goals closer to PT will go back and run it. Well, if you do, do a good job of it and then try to get to PT. But you’ll wish you’d tried harder to get the banks upward toward PT, not back down toward the beginning of track. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 113 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 24 APRIL 1963 Missions "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 3M2 TIPS THE ROCKET READ OF A RELIABLE ITEM The right R3 reliable item on a list rocket reads differently than the other RRs. The experienced auditor will get to know it. The right RI usually has a softer RR. It is already disintegrating. It is accompanied by a blowdown of the TA. The wrong RR is hard, crisp and a real fine demonstration RR. It is not accompanied by a blowdown of the TA. It is pretty but it isn’t taking off charge. The right RI’s RR is quite often detected by only seeing its accelerated start or its whip- crack end. It is longer than the wrong RI’s RR, sometimes so long its end is right off the right hand of the dial. It may look therefore to the new observer like a very rapid fall with an accelerated start accompanied by a TA blowdown. Sometimes the right RI loses its charge so fast that it RRs only once on call and would have to be tiger drilled to be made to fire again. As calling it may turn on somatics on the pc, the pc suppresses a second call of it. The wrong RI’s RR fires well but has no blowdown. It is shorter. To an uninitiated auditor, the TA sailing down (or up on a low TA case [1.5]) had better be called an adequate read for an RI. Then he will begin to see the accelerated start as he gets more experience on the whip- crack end and realize that right RIs in R3M are long, loose and disintegrating. And that wrong RIs, while they RR beautifully, do not disintegrate on being called and the TA remains up (or very low). None of this applies necessarily to the RRs seen in finding or checking goals. But these too may have a disintegrating RR and heavy blowdown. But a new goal must continue to RR. None of this excuses accepting an RI that does not RR. An RI must RR to be accepted. An RI with a mere fall is not acceptable. _____________ NULLING R3 RI OPPOSE LISTS If you have to null a list with X’s and /’s for an RI to be found, it is almost certain that the right RI is not on the list. The right RI “explodes” when put down or called. The RI list that has to be nulled by elimination does not have the RI on it. The exception is the source list which of course is nulled in the usual way. _____________ LISTING RULES All listing rules ever released apply to RI lists (except length of RI oppose lists) in R3M, even if they are only two items long! 114 If two items fire in the same list it’s incomplete, etc., etc. Nothing has changed the rules of listing. "},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Taking items off an incomplete list, particularly a source list, can be deadly to the pc. Directive listing does not change listing rules, except that the list may be only one item long, or 5 to 30 at the most. DON’T ECHO INVALIDATE The practice of echo invalidation is easily fallen into in R3 Directive Listing. Echo invalidation: The pc gives an item. The auditor calls it back to the pc and says it doesn’t RR. If this is kept up the pc will be put into a state of SEN that is appalling. The right way to do this is as follows: Pc gives item. Auditor writes it down. Pc says that’s it. Auditor calls the RI being listed from to test its charge. If it doesn’t react, auditor reads back the one item given. If it RRs on one call, looks for its blowdown. If it blows down on TA, says, “That is your item.” If the RI listed from reads or if the new item doesn’t RR when the auditor calls it, or if it doesn’t blow down the TA (or up on a 1.5 reading case), the auditor says: “Give me several more” and keeps the pc listing until an RI- type RR appears on the list or is directed onto it by auditor. Then the auditor goes through the standard steps, reads the RI being listed from to be sure it doesn’t read, calls off the next to the last RRing item, says it doesn’t RR (unless it does), reads the pc’s item once, sees it give an RR or disintegrating RR, watches for blowdown (which may have begun already) and says, “That’s your item.” If things go wrong, never start echo invalidation. Keep to form, suggest the proper RI or variation the pc hasn’t thought of, get several. Echo invalidation, in which pc names an item and auditor says, “That isn’t it,” is not just bad form but a very vicious practice that leads to a games condition. The invalidation of each item makes the pc very dizzy and very desperate. The pc, sick and confused, starts plunging in desperation for the right item and goes swiftly down tone and out of session. High pc morale is vital to blowing charge and finding RIs. Uphold the pc’s morale. Don’t begin echo invalidation. A reverse practice is uncontrolled listing. Uncontrolled listing: The pc is permitted to list on and on with no stops or checks on the RI being listed from. Does not apply to long source lists where one lists 50 beyond last R/ S or RR for new goal. The pc, on an RI oppose list (not a source list) must be stopped every few items (usual number is 5) and the RI being listed from checked. Get the RI on the list but stop the listing when the list is complete. L.

All the above RIs are given as actually found except some of the RIs in the goal as an oppterm area (Eagerness to Have a Game upwards to goal as an oppterm, some 18 RIs) which were plotted from another bank. The remainder, aside from those 18, are exactly as found. The bank is too early to adventure into lightly, so do not try to find or run this goal on your pc. It is early enough to be ordinarily unrestimulative on inspection. The actual goal is common to most pcs. POINTS OF INTEREST The opposition terminals gradually increase as the goal is lived, to become the goal. The terminals decrease as lived until goal is repugnant. Each terminal and each oppterm contains a form of the goal. There are neither terminals nor oppterms that contain entirely different words than the goals. If you make an error in following this pattern or fail to get the right RI your pc’s RR will get shorter and vanish on the next 3 or 4 RIs. This will hold good for all goals and all GPMs. Any corrections and patterns for other goal forms will be released as fast as I find them. I do not guarantee there are not more RIs in a GPM. USE This pattern will serve to locate the RIs of any goal using Directive Listing. The form of the word may be different but not its sense. The form of the negative"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"may be any negative but is almost always NO, particularly in the upper half of the terminals. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 121 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 29 APRIL 1963 Central Orgs Missions URGENT ROUTINE 3 DIRECTIVE LISTING LISTING LIABILITIES Nothing has changed to alter the mechanics or laws of listing. Now that the pattern of the GPM is exactly known, the pc can be told what RI to put on the list. This requires only 5 or 6 variations from the pattern RI. BUT the values contained in just listing are lost. UNDERLISTING These things happen when underlisting is done even though the right RIs are found: 1. Half the charge is left in the GPM; 2. The pc’s directed RI does not RR; 3. The pc is prevented from cogniting on the RI found because it is still charged; 4. The pc’s body weight increases; 5. The GPM run through once is stiff, the pc is queasy about it; 6. The pc’s body is subjected to unusual stresses; 7. The auditor is led to fake RRs or believe the pattern is wrong; 8. The pc doesn’t get Clear. All these things can be prevented by: A. Listing every list to a clean needle; 122 B. Considering the RI being listed from is reacting even if when called for test it reads latently or only roughs the flowing character of the needle; C. Don’t buy an RI unless the pc understands it and if he doesn’t understand it, make him list charge off; D. Making the pc answer the listing question, not plunge for the “right pattern RI.” _____________ "},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"A CONVINCING TEST On most pcs the right RI won’t RR until the charge from other listable items has been taken off. You can make this test. Take the pc’s next RI to be listed for. Let’s say it’s “perfect catfish.” The question is “Who or what would no all catfish oppose?” Get all possible combinations of the right RI (perfect catfish) from the pattern, (catfish perfected, perfection catfish, etc.), make the pc put them on the list. Now test by calling “no all catfish.” You’ll see a roughed up needle even if no instant tick appeared. And probably no real RR, only a fall, will be seen on testing “perfect catfish.” Now make the pc really answer the listing question without regard to the pattern RI “perfect catfish” but just what he thinks “no all catfish” would oppose. You will see several RRs probably and maybe an R/ S or two on a list of only 30 items. You will observe the pc’s needle go smooth. Call “no all catfish” again to the pc. You will see that there is no slightest roughening of the smooth flow of the needle. Now have the pc put all combinations of “perfect catfish” back on the list. One will RR beautifully. Call it off to the pc (no other nulling done, no BMRs). It will RR again and the TA will blow down TO CLEAR READ. Now examine your list. You will see that the right RI placed at the top of the list had a poor or absent RR or only fell when put down. If you had accepted it at the top of the list you would not have gotten a nice RR BECAUSE ALL THE RRing AND R/ Sing ITEMS YOU SAW AFTER IT WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN THE PC’S BANK! You should make this test on your R3 pc. Then you’ll understand all about it because you will have seen it. _____________ NINETY PERCENT OF THE GPM RIs WHEN FOUND AND CALLED TO THE PC SHOULD BRING THE TONE ARM OF THE METER TO CLEAR READ. (Note: the pc may be in the valence of the opposite sex in any GPM during its running. Therefore the pc’s Clear read will be for the opposite sex in that GPM). 123 _____________ The lesson here is this: ONE AUDITS THE PC WITH ROUTINE 3, ONE DOES NOT JUST RUN A BANK. Routine 3 is an auditing tool. One uses it to audit the pc. If audited, the pc gets better and feels better. If just “run through a bank” a pc will benefit but won’t clear. REMOVING CHARGE Truly skilled use of Routine 3 removes all the charge. Auditing is for the pc. True, it is wholly the number of RIs you get. But what about those other RRing and R/ Sing items. They’re the pc’s too. The cross- section of a real R3 reliable item looks like this; if the spherical"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"cluster were split in half: All charge comes from the RRing RI. The remainder borrow their charge from it. The RI looks like a steel sphere covered with a heavy layer of black smoke. This black smoke is actually RRing lock items in the inner area and R/ Sing (2- 12) Items in the outer area. 124 If you get the RI discharged nearly everything blows. But a few of the RRing first ring and one or two of the outer R/ Sing items will still hang on. The pc is trying to list through the outer rings to the center core RI. This anatomy is not graphic. It is actual. A GPM consists of less than two hundred RIs, about 6,000 RRing lock items and about 15,000 R/ Ses. (The figures 6,000 and 15,000 are approximate.) Listing by Directive Listing against the pattern of a GPM you get most of these RRing or R/ Sing secondary items. But you don’t get them all even on a cleanly RRing pc. To get them all, and on most pcs even to get a good RR on the RI, you have to list off charge as well as List by Pattern. If you get the primary RI these secondary items never need to be opposed. They just blow. If you do oppose one or a slightly incorrect RI your TA will go high and stay high. _____________ Many plans for doing this could exist. I would prefer this one and have used it with success. It would even apply to a pc who RRed well on pattern running 1. Tell the pc what to put on the list, get the most ordinary variations of it. See that one falls well. None are called back to the pc. 2. Tell the pc, “Now let’s get the secondary items off. Just answer the question any way you want: “Who or what ?” 3. Let the pc rattle off a lot, the auditor meanwhile just looking at the meter, watching the falls, R/ Ses and RRs, but looking for the moment the needle begins to flow smoothly (none of this is written down and it should take only a couple of minutes); 4. Stop the pc from further “random listing” and have the pc put some variations of the pattern RI on the list, working hard with the pc to get the wording exactly correct. 5. As soon as these pattern of the GPM type items being listed cease to disturb the needle and one or more have RRed, stop. 6. Read the RI being listed from to the pc to be sure it doesn’t react or roughen the needle (if it does, repeat step 5); 7. Read the last RRing pattern items to the pc. One only, without any other nulling"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"or ruds or Tiger Drill, will RR and blow down the TA; 125 8. Tell the pc “Your item is . That rocket reads.” This is only done the first time through a bank and not when simply passing through a GPM the third time to align it and pass the charge down. The pc run this way will be bright and sparkling the whole way, lots of cognitions. Suppress, Protest and Decide have to be cleaned on the list or the session if things don’t go well but only when all other Routine 3 means of handling things have become very impeded. Don’t use any rudiments or Tiger Drill or nulling or BMRs in Routine 3 unless totally driven to it, and only then after all R3 means have been exhausted. Far from wasting session time, you will find this gets more RIs in a session because the pc’s confront comes up. It saves time. SUMMARY You can run a whole GPM on Directive Listing and the pattern of a GPM without removing a single secondary item. But the penalties of doing only that are given at the beginning of this HCO Bulletin. Audit the pc with Routine 3. Don’t just run Routine 3 on a pc. PS: Don’t overlist either! L.

Below the terminal RI, A BEING WHO WOULD HATE TO HAVE A GAME add the terminal RI, A BEING WHO WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE A GAME. The above two were missed in copying the line plot. Add the level GLEE below ENTHUSIASTIC in both upper and lower “dwindlings.” _____________ This actual line plot was completely run except for the levels Absolute to Vital in the lower dwindling which were put in from another GPM. FUTURE CORRECTIONS Since running this actual Goals Problem Mass TO HAVE A GAME, in running out other GPMs a great deal of additional data has emerged both as to the character of a GPM, its source and how to run one, as I am working very hard on technical. The job is very nearly complete as to research, though it has been pretty grim facing up to this totally unknown area of the reactive mind. I acted as a pc on it because I didn’t know if a body would live through it. It does- but care is needed in handling a GPM while in a body and great accuracy is required or the pc will gather mass and feel strain on heart and lung machinery. I am now assembling and cross- checking all levels of RIs and sequences of goals. Practically all the material is in sight but the speedy need of it is very difficult to meet. I have done, with Mary Sue’s help, about a decade of research since December last with Mary Sue as the auditor and myself as a pc. 128 My RR is practically indestructible and my confront is good on this. Therefore, and only therefore could the job be done. Other pcs’ RRs are too weak for research and their confront is not up to it. Therefore I had to guinea pig it. This doesn’t make me any hero but it has been"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"fortunate for us that I could do this as nobody currently under processing has come close to the actual pattern and without it we would be stopped. I did not realize the vitalness of the data or the weakness of RRs until March. Because it was I who went through it, I completely underestimated the ability of the average pc to confront it and find RIs. Thus a whole technology of running has had to be developed (Directive and Random Listing) to cope with these factors of poor RRs and low confront. So this burden was added on to research and therefore my data release has fallen behind. I have been struck by the importance attached to this material. Cables and telexes have been coming in demanding the data. I am putting out the material as fast as I can and it should all be released shortly. What auditors do not realize is that any finding of RIs at any level in a GPM releases charge. If RIs are bypassed the pc, however, is uncomfortable or ARC breaky. If this story of finding this pattern and the GPMs is incredible, the actual story of the GPMs is even more so. The data entirely changes our line of attack on public dissemination, more toward the Dianetic approach but still within the framework of Scientology and the human spirit. There are a very few more RIs in a GPM than shown in TO HAVE A GAME. The upper dwindling (top oppterm down) is apparently always ABLY or INGABLY, never any other word form. The lower dwindling (goal down) is apparently always ABLE or INGABLE. This is not shown in the Line Plot of 28 Apr. 63 as it was learned from other GPMs the following week. The lowest oppterm is not correct. For reasons to be covered later this oppterm should be something else. The whole of the terminal side should always be NIX _____________ not NO _____________ More ancient cultures have more emphatic negatives. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 129 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 5 MAY 1963 ROUTINE 3 R3 STABLE DATA On the first GPM run on a pc you get a further departure from the pattern than in subsequent GPMs. The pc’s confront is barred off by charge. The thing to do is run the first GPM as you can, then get the “closer to PT” GPMs by listing “What goal would oppose (GPM’s goal just run)?” Don’t go “backtrack,” come “closer to PT” for the next GPM. You almost never get the “PT GPM” the first time as the pc’s first goal. The upper"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"dwindling oppterms (top oppterm down) are all adverbial. Apparently All words are ABLY or INGABLY. The lower dwindling oppterms (goal down) are all adjectivial. Apparently all words are ABLE or INGABLE. The correct forms of the words apparently do not vary for any goal’s RIs. There is no difference of pattern goal to goal or pc to pc. Only significance of goals change pc to pc. The terminals are all NIX where they have negative starts, not NO . More cultured tongues have degrees of negative and NIX is closer than NO . If NO is used some mass will pile up on the terminal side. NIX used instead of NO dispels this mass. Never rerun a partially run GPM. Always complete a GPM to the bottom including the goal oppose list at the end before rerunning or correcting a GPM. Go back two RIs if you must. But never more. Correct a GPM’s RIs only after the GPM has been gone through once. If a partially run GPM is rerun or corrected before completion, it will stiffen up. Always run a GPM top to bottom, never bottom to top. Always get the pc to the “topmost” GPM as soon as possible before going for “early track” GPMs. Run RIs off the case as fast as possible. Don’t linger around fooling with a top oppterm combination more than a few hours. If you can’t get it go into the bank at the goal as an oppterm. It shatters a pc to fool about hunting the top oppterm for 20 or 30 hours. Get RIs run and charge off the case. THE BOTTOM OPPTERM The bottom (lowest) oppterm is always a trick combination of the next goal below and the goal being run. Sometimes a NOT or NIX is added between them. It’s an idiotic simplicity. The two goals are just joined to make sense. Example: Goal being run: To never fish. Next lower goal: to catch catfish. The bottom oppterm of the GPM “to never fish” is therefore “to never fish to catch catfish.” I almost sprained the brain trying to find this one. It connects each GPM one to the next. It’s a keystone. If the pc is a few RIs down from the top, or in the body of a GPM, or a few RIs from the bottom, you can’t get another goal to fire. To get another goal to fire, you have to complete all the way to the bottom, the one you are running. Two goals or more can be firing at one time. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 130 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 8 MAY 1963 Central Orgs Missions ROUTINE 3 THE NATURE OF FORMATION OF THE GPM All goals contacted on the preclear early in his processing and made to rocket read are implants."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":" An implant is an electronic means of overwhelming the thetan with a significance. In the case of implanted Goals Problem Masses, use was made of the mechanics of the actual pattern of living to impress and entrap a thetan and force obedience to behavior patterns. The goal selected was not based on any goal of the thetan but was an entirely arbitrary selection, both as to goal and pattern, by those conducting the implanting. Implanting was an activity carried out to prevent retribution from executed persons, to dispose of captured armies and block their return home as thetans, to dispose of “excess population,” to “fit” a thetan for a colonization project, to dissuade revolutionaries, simply to implant, and many other reasons. Lacking actual technology, time, real purpose and common decency, the electronic implant was the standard short- term means of handling the problems of life. To us this activity is highly discreditable, even criminal. That implanting was undertaken and done is witnessed by the weird uses of electricity by the psychiatrist who has no therapeutic excuse for doing so and does not even know that he undertakes a very low- order dramatization of whole track actions. That whole populations have been disposed of by beings needs no further evidence than Hitler’s pogroms against the Jews wherein he involved huge vitally needed war resources and elaborate scientific skills to exterminate 6,000,000 human beings who had committed no real crimes against him. Implants are not necessarily the work of pranksters or madmen but the solemn scientific combined effort of careful, dedicated politicians, learned men and psychologists and technicians, who work under the orders of short sighted states. How they excuse this activity would probably make an interesting study in itself. That the intention is not for the good of anyone is witnessed by the fact that many of the goals so implanted dictate criminal activities. 131 Implants result in all varieties of illness, apathy, degradation, neurosis and insanity and are the principal cause of these in man. IMPLANTED GOALS The pattern and similarity of goals and GPMs should make one aware of their actual nature as implants. That implanted goals and GPMs exist does not mean that the pc’s own goals and GPMs do not exist. However, to get to the pc’s own goals and GPMs one must run the implanted ones. Indeed, so long as implants do exist and have to be run, it is almost fortunate for they give the pc the increase in confronting and case gain confidence needed to handle the whole track and the auditor the experience in listing necessary to handle the whole track. There is no real difference between the technology needed to handle an implant GPM and the whole track. Finding purposes and listing are common to both. Both have a"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"basic pattern, though the implant pattern does not vary pc to pc, goal to goal. You won’t find a real whole track goal on a pc until the implanted goals are handled, and even if you did it would snap into an implanted goal. The difference between a whole track RI and an implant RI consists of somatic and visio. Implant somatics are pressure, heat, electrical and generalized pain. There is no changing visio, usually just the implant station and its false pictures intended to confuse. A whole track RI has visio, motion and sharp identifiable somatics, as from spear wounds, crashes, etc. For twelve years I have looked for technology to “get around” implants and not run them. Instead I found one could not get around them and found the technology to get through them. Everyone has these implants that is here on this planet. Do we know as much as the implanters? Yes. We know more about life and its laws and this universe than those who implanted. Does this debar clearing? No, it makes clearing easier as it gives a pattern of goals and RIs that can be followed. Is the gain as great in running out implants? The only immediate gain you will get on Homo sapiens is running out implants. These implants are the immediate source of those troubles he is most concerned about. The gains in running them are impressive. When can one run the whole track and the pc’s own GPMs? When the implants are run. 132 Does running an implant assist whole track running? The implants have grouped the whole track in a pc. Random listing during the running of implants straightens out a lot of whole track. Does running an implant harm the body? No, not if expertly done. There is a lot of physical discomfort in running an implant GPM and mass may pile up on the pc but the completion of the job sees this “damage” also swept away. Does running an implant change the pc’s patterns of behavior? The only troublesome patterns of behavior the pc has reactively are from these implants. The resurgence and relief is enormous. Does this change the definition of Clear? No. It clarifies it. Clear could mean “a thetan cleared of enforced and unwanted behavior patterns and discomforts.” THE MOOD OF THE PC The finding that the GPMs you are contacting are implants accounts for (a) the violence of R3 ARC breaks and (b) the suspicion with which Scientology is. sometimes regarded. Down deep a thetan on this planet knows he or she was given false purposes and sent here under a cloud. This is attested by the enthusiasm with which a pc will erase “his goal.” Let an auditor err and force or confuse the pc and the pc instantly reverts to the"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"moods experienced during the actual implant, which are, amongst others, anger, fear, apathy, compounded by feelings of degradation and betrayal. The pc instantly feels he is again being implanted. The R3 methods of handling an ARC break keep this to a minimum. Whole groups of people suddenly become convinced that a Central Org or Scientologists are up to some evil. They have confused a Scientologist who is undoing an implant with the crews who implanted. A = A = A. This paranoid reaction to Scientology stems from this one mechanism, the implanted character of people. HEARTBREAK One’s first reaction to this news may be one of heartbreak, feeling betrayed, etc. I felt the same way when I found it out. Then I realized the emotion came out of the implants themselves. One is supposed to feel disheartened and betrayed when he or she realizes it. That keeps it from being undone and leaves the being trapped. The reaction is just part of the trap. But before I realized this, I only waited a day or two to be sure. I have always persevered in my honesty with you and have given you a vital research datum as fast as I knew it, regardless of its palatability. This is one of those times. At first I thought this puts clearing too far up in hours. And I didn’t know how you’d take it. 133 Then, I rapidly summed up the pluses and minuses of the situation and came up with this datum: Implant or no implant, WE NOW KNOW THE FIRST GOAL TO BE RUN ON EVERY CASE and we know its pattern. Some fifty hours after starting, a Class III or IV Auditor, knowing the goal and its pattern, can make a first goal Clear. In other words anyone signing up, for instance in an HGC, can be a first goal Clear in two intensives. The randomity of looking for the first goal and its RIs has vanished. The pc’s confront comes up, up, up. What, at the worst, has happened is that it will take longer to run a pc to OT as one has to handle these implanted banks before handling the actual whole track. BUT, the door is open to steady unquestionable gain in that direction without maybes. And the state of OT attainable by auditing is probably much more powerful than we have imagined. BANK CONFUSIONS An implant is meant to be tricky and confusing. We have outsmarted it by finding the patterns of these. But do not expect to find the banks not confusing to the pc even still. Let the pc grasp any confusing situation before forcing the pc into going on. The “bank closest to PT” is actually the furthest from PT. The bank was implanted from top oppterm down. Basic, then, is the “PT goal.” A pc can’t run from “bottom” to “top” as that’s backwards. If you get the basic (closest to “PT”) goal very well erased, the others tend to"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"soften up. This is our old “get the basic on the chain.” Basic is the top oppterm of the closest to PT goal. The O/ W sequence is present. The one who has the hardest run of it in a bank has done the most implanting. But, motivators or not, these implants must be run. The overts can be handled later. Well that’s the announcement. When you come out of any decline it puts you into, get busy and get through. You were supposed to feel disheartened. L.

And I’ve found that Scientologists have been to Heaven. And that everybody has evidently been to Heaven. The Goals Problem Mass implants, which are the apparent basic source of aberration and heaven travail, which began with the goal To Forget, were cynically done in “Heaven”. For a long while, some people have been cross with me for my lack of co- operation in believing in a Christian Heaven, God and Christ. I have never said I didn’t disbelieve in a Big Thetan, but there was a certain something very corny about Heaven et al. Now I have to apologize. There was a Heaven. Not too unlike, in a cruel betrayal, the heaven of the Assassins in the 12th Century who, like everybody else, dramatized the whole track implants - if a bit more so. Yes, I’ve been to Heaven. And so have you. And you have the pattern of it’s implants in the HCO Bulletin Line Plots. It was complete with gates, angels and plaster saints - and electronic implantation equipment. So there was a Heaven after all - which is why you are on this planet and were condemned never to be free again - until Scientology. Before you went to Heaven you were not really very bad or very good, but you didn’t think you had lived only once, and you had a good memory and knew who you were and enjoyed life. Afterwards - The symbol of the crucified Christ is very apt indeed. It’s the symbol of a thetan betrayed. DATA Additional work and possible corrections need to be done but this is the gist of the matter: The implants are electronic in nature and follow a certain pattern of the G. P. M. The implant station existed on the order of magnitude of 43,000,000,000,000 years 135 ago. (The dates may be part of the implants, but do not appear so at this time. However, a possibility of correction of dates is reserved.). Some have been through it once, some more than once. The first time I arrived and the moment of the implant To Forget was dated at 43,891,832,611,117 years, 344 days, 10 hours, 20 minutes and 40 seconds from 10: 024 PM Daylight Greenwich Time, May 9, 1963."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" There are no earlier such implants. There no later such implants. I evidently have a goal of my own at 305 Trillion (U. S.) years and an actual GPM, all of which pulled into this 43 Trillion year implant. ADDITIONAL E- METER DATA Five goals in all may be common to both sequences. The first 3 of the 5 are the same. There are no implants, but dates rocket read. Implanting was done on a non- visible thetan, but arrival was in a ship in a doll body according to the meter. Star of Bethlehem, Pearly Gates, The Way out of the Universe, all of which RR on the meter, give a clue to recruitment actions. There was no purpose in giving a particular thetan a particular goal. Planning had no individualization. A preclear’s overts should be scouted as to why these implants keyed in, Fac 1, hypnotism, etc. But doubtful if any preclear did this type of implanting. The mood is set that thetans are evil, treacherous and bad, but this is all part of the implant, not factual. The earliest point of the series is not known at this writing but possibly contains a recruitment through advertising. The departure method from the series is not fully known yet but probably just abandonment. The implants were not done in a box or in some trick manner of projection. The scenery is actually there, common Mest Universe space and matter and in Mest Universe. The first (43 Trillion ) series consists of 29 implanted goals. The second (42 Trillion ) series consists of 21 implanted goals. The first three goals in both series are the same, To Forget, To Remember and To Go Away. The last goal and one other in both series are the same. The remaining goals are not the same for the two implants. PERSONALLY PERCEIVED DATA 136 The pattern of RI’s is different for the two series, consisting in the second series of added RI’s below the To Have a Goal- iving and with a different dwindling of adjectives and adverbs, but are otherwise similar. Both series have the Gates of Heaven visible. The last implant of both consists of “entering” Heaven. The last goal of both is To Be In Heaven. The gates of the first series are well done, well built. An avenue of statues of saints leads up to them. The gate pillars are surrounded by marble angels. The entering grounds are very well kept, laid out like Bush Gardens in Pasadena, so often seen in the movies. Aside from the implant boxes which lie across from each other on the walk there are other noises and sounds as though the saints are defending and berating. These are unimportant to the incident. The second series, probably in the same place, shows what a trillion years of overt acts does (or is an additional trickery to collapse one’s time). The saints have vanished. So have the Angels. A sign on one (the left as you “enter”) says “This is"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Heaven”. The right has a sign “Hell” with an arrow and inside the grounds one can see the excavations like archeological diggings with row terraces, that lead to “Hell”. Plain wire fencing encloses the place. There is a sentry box beside and outside the right pillar. The road “leading up” to the gates is deeply eroded. An effigy of Joseph, complete with desert clothing, is seen approaching the gates (but not moving) leading a donkey which “carries” the original Madonna and a child from “Bethlehem”. The implanting boxes lie on either side of this “entering” at path level. These are the actual ends of the two series. One backs out of the gates, of course, from top oppterm down, as this is the end. The last two RI’s after this last goal say “it is the beginning”, “Not the end”. The place, by implant and inference, was supposed to be in the sky like a floating island. Actually it was simply a high place in the mountains of a planet and the gates pathway falls away into a gorge, very eroded and bare by the time of the second implant, but heavily forested and rolling at the time of the first. The beginnings have not at this writing been so well explored by myself. I have not viewed the second beginning (which says it is the end). However, I do know that the second series was done in long square tunnels with implant boxes, not unlike small P. A. speakers with fretwork fronts, on either side. The first series actually begins with arrival in a “town” (as everything is backwards to upset the time sense). This “town” consisted of a trolley bus, some building fronts, sidewalks, train tracks, a boarding house, a bistro in a basement where there is a “bulletin board” well lighted, and a BANK BUILDING. The bank is the key point of interest. It is interesting that we use the word “bank” (taken from computerology) to indicate the reactive mind. This bank building was on- the- corner old- fashioned granite- like construction, two or three stories high, with the door in the rounded front -even a revolving type door. Inside to the left of the entrance door is a rounded counter. Directly across the room are THE 137 stairs. The top oppterm and terminal of To Forget are at the top of these stairs. The implant then proceeds on down the stairs, step by step, terminals on one side (the left if one were coming up the stairs) the oppterms on the other. The first series (43 Trillion) has all its implant impulses at step level. In the second series the boxes are ear high to a man. By the time the gates are arrived at in the first series, the terminals are on the left as you approach the gates, the oppterms on the right, having been reversed at some point. The first (43 Trillion) series had very fine marble stairs. The same stairs can be seen in any big well kept railway station. They were complete with a white ball held in a wrought iron stand. The thetan was taken along apparently on a pole trap to which he was stuck. It does not proceed step by step throughout the whole of the implant series, but after the first flight of stairs, goes a ways, stops while several pairs of RI’s fire then to a new location. The place seemed to have people in it. But they are all effigies. Those seem radioactive. Contact with them hurts. No living beings are seen. But the effigies that look like humans are performing sudden, repetitive actions with long halts in between. In the “basement” such dummies are seen operating machinery."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":" The boarding house at the actual beginning has a dummy guest and a landlady in kimono and wrappers, reading a newspaper. There are no devils or Satan’s that I saw. There is a passenger getting on the trolley bus, a “workman” halfway down the first stairs of “To Forget” “eating lunch” and in To Be in Heaven a gardener or electrician adjusting an implant box behind a hedge and periodically leaping up and screaming. The place, so long as the implants remain only partially discharged, seems to swim in black and white electronic masses, but these dissipate as the implants are run out by pattern. One actually “enters” the “town” as the first action. The implants, however, were rigged to makes the gates seem the entrance to the incident. One backs through from the town, into the bank, down the steps and eventually out the pearly gates, down the hillside and is there let off and abandoned. “TO BE IN HEAVEN” is the last goal implanted in both series. This is not a body building implant, though running it gives somatics to the chest. This is not a GE implant. It is the person’s own. Running it, particularly badly, brings it down on the body. There are body somatics on it, however, particularly eyes, face, chest, bones. It apparently only can be run by 3M listing and rocket reads. One must have the goal to get the RI’s. 138 CONCLUSIONS The place is so full of lies by implant that the preclear becomes quite confused and this review of the actual date is necessary to a successful navigation. However, it is very easy to read more treachery into it than there is in it - which is enough. However, as the place existed so long it was in a varying state of repair and some change. (This data on time is subject to review). But in 1,2 Trillion years only some of the implant pattern and mock up had shifted. However, there may have been other stations. Only time and research will really tell that. One must date the preclear’s first (earliest) goal to forget, find how many times the preclear went through it, or some such implant station, date the other times and be careful to run only the first of the series. As this is basic, as in prepchecking, Sec checking and old engram running, it tends to case up the remainder of the implants. But running the implants later than basic is very much harder on the pc even though it can be done. Wherever one misses an RI in an implant, that repeating RI when found in a later one tends to be very much more heavily charged. Re- running any implant that has only been partially run tends to rough up the whole implant and make it hard to run. LUCK I think we are lucky. It could have been much worse. This heavenly dream of destruction could have been current, not so long ago. It could have happened often,"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"not just once or twice or three times per pc. But apparently it didn’t and is unique in itself. This is the core of the Reactive Mind. It is all the way South. For here, just once on the whole track, somebody discovered the mechanism of purposes and RI’s and utilized them to install religious mania and pin thetans down to “one life” and planets. The thing was done so well that it has hung up ever since. There are other implants, there are other goals and GPMs, but these are minor and easily found and listed once this key implant series is out of the way. We were in a position of having an infinite number of pieces to the puzzle. Now we have a finite number which even though very tough, are still finite in number. Further, every processing step taken, every RI discharged is a positive gain toward a definite result in processing. Further, we have our hands on an appalling bit of technology where the world is concerned. With repidity and a Meter it can be shown that Heaven is a false dream, and that the old religion was based on a very painful lie, a cynical betrayal. What does this do to any religious nature of Scientology? It strengthens it. New religions always overthrow the false gods of the old, they do something to better man. We can improve man. We can show the old gods false. And we can open up the universe as a happier place in which a spirit may dwell. What more can you expect? 139 This actually places us far beyond any other beings that are about. It puts us, through increased beingness and a restoration of life, in control of much destiny. We now have only a few unsolved problems about life, huge though they may be, such as the construction of bodies, and how does one establish the character of and communicate, if feasible, with beings who are making trees and insects. There are a few things like these. But I imagine when we finally manage to communicate with beetles under rocks and free them, we’ll no doubt find the Creator of Heaven who 43+ Trillion years ago designed and built the Pearly Gates and trapped us all. Good Lord, I’d hate to be guilty of that overt. But never mind - you aren’t either. That guy is GONE (I hope!). L.

In the following form there may be an RI in juxtaposition or a missing pair (on test now I have found it all correct so far as I can tell) but except as indicated this is the exact pattern, in that your pc has all of these. If your pc’s goal does not follow this form you are running the second series at 41 trillion. An approximation of the word is not acceptable. With a little random listing the right one will RR. Example: “Enjoying Catfish” is not good enough. It would have to be “Enjoyably Catfish” as given. Only a variation in the middle of the word sometimes occurs, i. e., Enjoyably fires as Enjoyfulably. Enjoy and -ably are always there. Only No may fire in the terminals, not NIX but if so mass will eventually stack up, GPM to GPM on the terminal side. Early on a case a bank is so charged up that almost anything will RR. So work for the right one as given, or in later GPMs that level will leave mass because basic on it (1st GPM) is wrong. This is not the pattern of the second series (41 or 42 trillion). The first series is probably available on your pc. Find it. If you can’t and pc got only the second series of GPMs (although I’m still prepared to find it all one consecutive implant) blunder about and get charge off by finding RIs. I haven’t run much of the second series. Without the first series run completely the accumulated charge on the second is too brutal. However I will have the full pattern of it in a very few weeks. I am auditing a fresh pc and am being audited at the rate of one RI per minute of auditing time. Blowdown is ignored. Only RIs are used now we have this pattern. This pattern should fit all the first series of implanted GPMs, 28 or 29 in number. The only trouble you’ll have is finding the correct top oppterm on some. Each goal consists of certain blocks of RIs. For instance, Block One (as noted on plot) is “Forgotten.” Therefore one has Forgotten as the Top Oppterm, NIX Forgotten as the top terminal. Then one has “Absoluteably Forgotten,” then “NIX Absoluteably Forgotten” as its terminal. And so on. The blocks are numbered. The appropriate ending or form goes in each block. ( See next page ) 141"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":" For To Forget, the blocks are: Block One - Top Oppterm: Forgotten Block Two - Goal: To Forget Block Three - Goal Minus “To”: Forget Block Four - Goal Minus “To” + able: Not present in first series of implants.

The bottom oppterm cannot be put in until you know the next goal. Put in any old oppterm that fires. Then when you have the next goal put in the bottom oppterm by asking “Who or what would the goal To oppose.” Get the right bottom oppterm of the upper GPM. (Consists of the two goals joined together to make sense.) Then list “Who or what would oppose (bottom oppterm just found)” and put To on the list. Then relist “Who or what would To (last RI of bank) oppose?” and put in Top Oppterm of next goal and you’re away into the next GPM. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 150 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 13 MAY AD 13 Central Orgs Missions ROUTINE 3 ROUTINE 3N DIRECTIVE LISTING WITH NEW ROUTINE 3 MODEL SESSION As I gathered experience in auditing a pc through the implant GPMs and being audited through them, it became obvious that we had need of a special routine to handle implant GPMs and a new Routine 3 Model Session. There are TWO technologies for auditing goals. You have in Routine 3M a completed technology, needed to audit the pc’s own goals. This need not be changed. However, as we moved into implant GPMs a great deal of Routine 3M and 3M2 could be dropped while running the implant GPMs. Therefore here is a streamlined routine developed for implant GPMs only. There are about 49 of these implant GPMs according to present data. Some pcs have more, some less. Unless one hits a speed of an RI every minute of auditing time, the task of clearing the pc of all these takes too long. There are 230 RIs in each one. So the speed necessity is self- evident. Therefore, we drop several actions from 3M2. We do not check the goal between RIs. We do not test the RI being listed from or the question. We drop the requirement of tone arm blowdown for an RI and we leave only the necessity that the RI RR well when said by the pc and called. The extraneous actions can be dispensed with because we now have the first series exact line plot as per HCOB 12 May 63, ROUTINE 3, RI FORM, (GPM RI FORM CORRECTED), and are doing only Directive Listing. By the numbered character of the line plot, one can keep the pc straight without telling the pc the RI. The session is so arranged that the auditor has a line plot before him and the pc has a copy propped up so that the pc can see it easily without moving about or shifting hands on the cans."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":" The auditor uses his own line plot copy as the pc’s line plot. Spare paper is handy in case any fiddle- about with words is necessary. The auditor keeps all RIs on the form provided to save unnecessary writing. The only thing the auditor guards against is incorrect oppose in his question- Who or what would oppose ? and Who or what would oppose? must never be mixed up. The question correct for the column below it is on the form. If any additional listing is necessary the auditor transfers the number of the RI being listed for to his spare paper and lists it there, if he lists in writing at all. There are no pauses while the auditor writes during the finding of most of the RIs. The auditor fills in the form as he asks. Form filling is also shorthanded by putting just a check mark on the terminal side to show it has been gotten. 151 RIs can thus be found and recorded almost as fast as auditor and pc can talk. The auditor must be very sure of his rocket read. The correct RI will fire once when the pc says it, slightly less when called back, less when part of the next question and ticks when opposed by the next RI. It is thereafter wholly discharged. It has to be called back to the pc and the next question then asked, using the RI just found. And that’s all. The only judgment is on “Did the pc hear it?” and “Is the pc distracted or suppressing?” Experience will guide you on these. Don’t waste time with lots of ruds or TDing RIs. A “What’s happening?” or “What happened?” in a critical moment saves almost all mid ruds. And when it doesn’t a “Suppress,” “Invalidate” put in on the pc is usually adequate for an RI and a “Protest,” “Assert” and “Decide” are enough when session ruds demand to be put in. The auditor takes the pc’s data always. And can act on it. But the auditor never takes the pc’s orders. When the auditor fails to take data the pc soon after begins issuing orders, most of which will be wrong. There is no case data except the pc’s data via pc and meter. The auditor handles the pc gently. Never continue a session beyond an ARC break until that ARC break is handled. Otherwise the pc thinks of the auditor as an enemy, which after all is characterized by forcing against will. The principal thing to accomplish in Routine 3N is a discharge of charge. Charge is seen on the meter by rocket reads (or rock slams, which don’t apply in 3N). This charge is seen to do one of two things: a. Discharge or b. Suppress. The auditor must be careful that the charge does not just suppress and that it actually discharges. All the charge present is represented by the rocket read. When the rocket read ceases to rocket read the charge is either discharged or suppressed. The auditor will quickly learn by experience which has happened. Suppressed charge is still on the case and retains command value on the pc. Sometimes an area (such as a whole GPM or engram) is so charged that the rocket reads continue to fire as the tone arm moves down. Sometimes (most of the time) the charge is so shallow that it contains only (a) one long rocket read, (b) one medium rocket read, (c) one short rocket read and (d) a tick, accompanied by about .2 divisions of TA fall over the lot."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":" In 3N one gets (a) the long RR when the pc first says the RI from his copy of the line plot form, (b) the medium RR when the auditor calls it back, (c) the short RR when the next oppose question is asked and (d) the tick when it is answered. One may not see (c) and (d). Often the whole charge goes on (a) and (b). Continuing to call a right RI does not produce an RR beyond the above. Only a wrong one continues to fire. What the auditor must be careful of is failing to get (a) and (b) (when the pc first says it and when the auditor calls it back). If no RR occurs, but only a fall, or if a short RR occurs at (a) or (b) the auditor must expect the pc has a suppress or was suppressing by being distracted. The thing to do is ask “What happened?” and get the pc’s answer and do the whole operation again. Don’t keep putting in big mid ruds or random listing when the above simple query will handle. 152 Sometimes the speed of run causes the pc to suppress cognitions. This will prevent rocket reads. It is quite enough to ask “What happened?” as above and the pc will tell you. Although 3N is fast, one must compensate for that speed by good sense. The more you harass a pc the less charge is gotten off and the fewer the RIs found per session. You don’t therefore use lots of session big mid ruds and RI big mid ruds. However, putting in the BMRs on Nix once or twice on various words in argument will pay off with a smoother run. Nix can always be made to fire as part of terminals. Pcs often hate it. Why? It’s part of the implant, that’s why. It’s the most used word in the implants. The pc does not have to understand the words to recover. However, getting the pc to study before a session the parts of speech involved will help. The things weren’t understood or were sneered at by the pc at the time they were implanted. Getting the pc to pick up any overt thoughts he had while going through will also help. But this is done only very occasionally in the session, not every RI. Routine 3N is a speed process which balances between too much and too little auditor doingness. Do enough to get the charge off. Don’t do too much and inhibit charge. Don’t do too little and leave charge on the case. The pc’s visio of the surroundings in the implant area as the pc goes through is not vital on the first run through the implants. But it shouldn’t be prevented either. Whether the pc looks or not is unimportant. The auditor can say “What does it look like?” once or twice in a session. Speed can come up to 1 RI every 30 seconds but should not fall lower than l RI every minute and a half of session time. An average of 1 RI per minute is good. This includes breaks, beginning and end of session. The first session or two may go much slower. Speed should be reached by the third to fifth session and maintained thereafter. Routine 3N cannot be used on those cases (five percent?) who are not native to this galaxy and do not have therefore the Helatrobus Implants, or who for some reason escaped them. On these the top oppterm and terminal of To Forget cannot be made to fire even when To Forget does. Such cases may have a goal “To persist” or “To exist for self alone” but these do not run by our line plots."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":" A pc who received only the second series of implants and not the first is run on 3N but by the second series line plot form. Pcs who do not have the Helatrobus Implants covered in R3N are best run by blocking out their time track and mild engram running. These are nonpattern pcs and their auditor has to develop the materials needed to handle their implants. Much data exists on this. Be awfully sure your pc does not have the goal To Forget and its top RIs, however, before deciding he or she is off pattern. Pcs like to be different. It’s dangerous to be predictable. And they often sell difference to an auditor. It is fortunate if the pc can be run on the Helatrobus Implants as it makes fast gains for little work. Run R3N as fast as you and the pc can talk. Do the RIs on the HCO Bulletin form. Save every corner of time you can. There are more than 10,000 RIs on most cases, some 153 far more, on a very few there are less. That’s about 170 hours of auditing time at one RI per minute. So you see why you’ve got to go- thetan- go. At two RIs per session it’s 5,000 hours or more! The reason we run the Helatrobus Implants is obvious, but you may have missed that they reduce the power of decision more than any other implants ever found- and the power of decision is the very core of self- determinism. ROUTINE 3 MODEL SESSION 1. Adjust the pc’s chair. 2. Make sure room is all right. 3. Test pc’s havingness. 4. Put in R- factor. 5. Start session. 6. Get session goals. 7. Use General O/ W if pc very agitated, or put in BMRs since last session, or pull missed W/ Hs as indicated to get pc into session, but if pc cheerful and needle smooth, just get down to work. 8. Accomplish body of session. In Directive Listing from forms this is 3N. 9. End body of session. 10. Smooth out any roughness in the session if there has been any, favoring Suppress, Failed to Reveal, Protest, Decide, Overts, Assert. 11. Get goals and gains. 12. Test havingness, run pc’s Havingness Process if necessary."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":" 13. Ask for anything pc wishes to say. 14. Ask if all right to end session. 15. End session including asking pc to say, “You are not auditing me.” Wording for the above follows the tradition of earlier Model Sessions. Adhere severely to this session form. It is nearly an irreducible minimum and is very fast, but it is all necessary. The random rudiment here is “What happened?”. Session mid ruds are simply “Protest, Assert and Decide.” RI rudiments are “Suppress and Invalidate.” 154 ARC break handling is in accordance with HCO Bulletin of 14 March 63, ROUTINE 2- ROUTINE 3, ARC BREAKS, HANDLING OF. Don’t continue a session until you find out why the ARC break. 8. BODY OF THE SESSION As per the above step 8, this is the body of a 3N session. The same session form as above is used for track scouting or engram running so that if these are done also no change of Model Session occurs. However what makes 3N 3N is the following: After having established that pc has the goal To Forget and the Helatrobus Implants (also done in the above session form) one proceeds as follows: a. Give the pc a copy of the required line plot to fit his goal or pre- RIs, making sure you have the latest and most accurate version. Prop it up so pc can read it or let pc have it on his lap, guarding against too much can juggling to get it read. The auditor takes a second copy of the same form for his line plot. Auditor: Give me number ( next RI). Who or what would oppose____ Last RI)? or Who or what would ( last RI) oppose? (as required). Pc: (Calling only the exact form RI) Avoidable Catfish. Auditor: (Has carefully observed E- Meter to make sure it RRed well. ) (Marks, but need not write in full, “Avoidable Catfish” place on his line plot form, verifies it is the right one to come up.) Thank you. I will read the item. Reads: “Avoidable Catfish.” (Sees that it RRs- will do so about half the width of the pc’s first RR just a moment before.) That rocket reads. (Notes next number or not and may or may not give it to pc according to how lost pc is liable to get.) (Uses last RI found in question:) Who or what would oppose Avoidable Catfish? Pc: Nix Avoidable Catfish. Auditor: (Sees that it RRed when pc said it. Marks his list.) I will read the item: (reads and as always notes meter reaction carefully) “Nix Avoidable Catfish” That rocket reads. Who or what would Nix Avoidable Catfish oppose? And so forth. The auditor’s remedy against something not rocket reading is usually “What happened?” Gets the pc’s answer and repeats the operation that didn’t produce"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"an RR. This usually gets the RR and the auditor just goes on. The pc had a heavy somatic or a cognition or looked at the next RI or just didn’t pay attention. The next remedy, if the above didn’t work, is to put in “Suppress and Invalidate” on the RI. Then one repeats the operation and goes on. If, however, no RR results yet, look over the line plot thoroughly to make sure you haven’t skipped or gotten mixed up or gotten a non- line plot RR. If all is well here, then do next paragraph: 155 If no RR yet, use Random Listing, letting the pc vary the wording as he or she wishes. Don’t write any of this down. You will see the meter RR on these odd variations given. When no more RRs are seen except on any repeat of the right RI, once more repeat the operation and you’ll get your RR. If none of these work then assume: a. You already got the charge off and missed it or b. You are doing something not procedure and have been gradually stacking up charge. To remedy either of the above try to get the next RI. If it fires well, just go on, as if the charge went off, the next one will fire, and if it didn’t the next one won’t. Your responsibility is to: 1. Get the charge off each RI and 2. Keep the pc calm and unharassed and speeding forward. You will quickly learn the particular tricks of your pc such as “press on,” “puzzling it out,” “getting tired,” and will get the hang of this pc’s meter so you can tell a suppress or whatever from a real RR very easily and adjust accordingly. It is obvious that such trouble has to be rare to get your quota of RIs in a session. Going from one goal to the next varies the above pattern. Here one lists a goal oppose list for the next goal to 50 beyond the last RR or R/ S, nulls the list and gets the next goal. This is a longish process. If there is no doubt what the next goal is just direct it on the list at once, making a one RI list, adjust the bottom oppterm of the goal just left, carry the charge through and get the next top oppterm at once. If you have the wrong next goal your pc will ARC break or the RR will fail to fire and the pc will develop much mass. Wrong next goal is probably the only liability that can give the auditor trouble now. ______________ This is Routine 3N. On the basis of its Model Session, all Routine 3 can be done as well as engram running. The essence of it is auditor direction. Direct the pc toward Clear, not toward ARC breaks, and you’ll soon have marvelous rewards from the processing. L.

Locate the goal To Forget and its top RIs to confirm that pc is native to this galaxy and has the implants. (Probably 95% of Scientologists do). 2. Date the first series. Find out if there is a second, third, fourth series. Date these. 3. Find out but do not run the type of overt pc has that keyed these implants in. 4. Move pc back to first contact with the implanters (talking radioactive clouds or theta traps or whatever is basic on the chain). Get just before the first one by finding when pc has no electronic somatics as you date. (Hear tape demonstration of Wednesday, l5th May 1963 for exact patter.) 5. Lightly run first contact (not first capture) or whatever is basic on the chain. Don’t go through it more than twice. Run no other engrams between it and actual implants or bank may beef up. 6. Run the “Vestibule RIs,” a plot of which will shortly be released, these being just before goal “To Forget.” 7. Resume running goal To Forget by R3N. 8. Continue to run the implants goal by goal from earliest to last of the first series (28 or 29 goals), using exactly consecutive progression. Don’t skip any goals or RIs! Get end RIs of first series. 9. When first series completely run, return to earliest point found in (4) above and run all contacts with implanters including capture rapidly, leaving none undischarged. 10. Return to end of first series and run all contact with implanters from end of first series to beginning of second series. 11. Run second series. 12. Run pc’s overt engrams related to implanting. 13. Proceed on through any remaining series of implants. 157 It is important not to run engrams if you can’t. You’ll just confuse the pc. And it’s important not to run engrams hard or through too many times before getting off the first series. "},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The implants are important. They are the charge that must be removed from the case. Three techniques are used to accomplish all this: 1. Dating 2. Engram running, modern style 3. Routine 3N. If you can’t do (1) and (2) then do only (3) and omit the balance of the program except Vestibule Implants, GPMs and End RIs. The other actions of dating and engram running make it easier to run the implants. But running the implants is the thing. Less than three hours should be consumed in dating and other actions than finding RIs in the implants. _______________ FAST BLOWING RIs When a case has been properly programed as above, by the time you have run the first three or four goals, if you do them well with 3N, exactly on the form line plot, you will encounter a “difficulty.” The RIs begin to discharge so fast that once the pc in session has said them, they do not again RR when the auditor says them. They have blown. This will only happen when the pc’s visio has turned up well on the implant stairways, and the RRs are wide and free as the pc says them. This changes none of the patter of R3N except saying something rocket read. One uses past tense of “read”: “That rocket read.” I can visualize a pc flying up tone to where this happens and the auditor nagging because there’s no second read when the auditor calls it. How can it? It’s gone- blown. By further rise in tone and with far more charge off, I can envision a pc racing along in session blowing RIs by inspection. Well, it’s observable when it happens that the whole of every RI’s charge is blowing. In such a case an auditor can further shorten the 3N patter in the interest of speed. But realize that the auditor’s job, the auditor’s ethics demand, whatever the pc’s attitude, that THE AUDITOR’S JOB IS TO GET THE FULL CHARGE OFF EVERY RI. L.

My answer to these attacks was to: 1. Hold the front legally, employing competent attorneys and others to halt the actions taken against us. 2. Develop a counterattack by upgrading research lines. The first part of this program is succeeding. A push on us in Australia has already collapsed and we have won. In America the situation continues to improve for us and there is little doubt of our winning eventually. The second part of our program is being successful beyond the most happy estimates. About five or ten years’ research work has been crowded into the last six months and although this has been hard work beyond belief, I have brought it off. The need was for an achievement of the state of Operating Thetan. While this state existed in theory, no time for an orderly development from aberree to Clear to OT was permitted by events. My task was to short- cut from aberree to OT and bypass all niceties of in- between states. No Scientologist needs to be told the significance of this in handling our affairs on Earth. This sudden speedup disrupted and probably upset many auditors. And I am sorry that this interrupted training programs and study. What had to be done was done. But it did disrupt all previous training and auditing expectancies. The first casualty was R2- 12. The moment I was informed of the US and Australian attacks I adopted the above two- point program and even though I knew it would upset things, I had no choice but to concentrate on those two points. So I dropped Routine 2- 12. And a short while thereafter was able to drop the ardures of goals finding. And working at top speed, laid open the impasses to OT and developed technology to overcome them. Well, all this, I can now state, has been successful. The gamble was upon the power of an OT. We won. An OT is so much more powerful than we have ever envisioned, that there is now no faintest doubt of the wisdom of the twopoint program above. The technology now exists for the creation of the state of OT. For many weeks now, the Saint Hill course technology has been steady and Saint Hill students have been successfully applying that technology and it, in its essential points, is in the hands of Central Orgs, and their staffs are being trained on it. We have moved fast. My estimate was that we had very few years from January 1963 before the roof fell in, not just on us, but on Earth. I thought I could bring this off in that period. In only five months it was being brought off. Short of this, I could not see how I could protect individual Scientologists from persecution and I was worried about them. The state of Clear was not enough. Therefore the technology of OT and a controlled environment were the only wholly satisfactory things I could do. 166 So don’t be shocked at the way R2- 12 and other data was dropped. That progress would have been orderly but a sudden time limit was placed on us by the Washington"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"raids. These were not more than a symptom of coming chaos, not just for us but for Earth. When a government has to imagine crimes to prosecute people for, that government is responding to times that are more chaotic than we believe. So here is the technical aspect of all this: 1. R2- 12 is replaced by ARC Processing designated R2- T. Any auditor can use it. It consists of three questions variously cleared and used which sweep away the RI locks on a repetitive process basis. 2. Any auditor trained to handle R2- 12 is benefited by being now easily trainable on R3- N which uses an even simpler approach. 3. The state of Clear is relegated to courtesy use without test, requiring only that a GPM has been run. First Goal Clear means one GPM run, Second Goal Clear means two GPMs run, etc. We will make no attempt to stabilize Clears but press them on to OT. 4. All concentration in auditing should be toward the state of OT (Free Thetan, as they were once known). 5. All Scientologists should cooperate in making OTs and in programs calculated to prevent the environment from degenerating into chaos. ______________ It takes about 500 hours to push an average case to OT with present technology, clearing GPMs and the time track. We have very little time, not just to make OTs, but to get things under control. So the time factors are very closely figured indeed. And there’s no time to be lost. If you enroll at Saint Hill you will make it faster. ______________ If the program seems at all unreal, then recall, the life we’re living here on Earth is a little unreal too. R2- T The basic commands of R2- T, are these: 1. “What attitude has been refused?” 2. “What reality has been rejected?” 3. “What communication has not been acknowledged?” Each process is given a cyclic ending (pc in PT again). Run the TA action out of each command in turn, then out of each one in turn again, etc. (Reduce to .25 div of TA motion in 10 minutes of auditing.) There are various ways of clearing these commands and various ways of using them which will be covered in later bulletins. These processes are powerful enough to open up any time track if properly used. They do not make an OT. They prepare the way to make one and they undo past auditing when prefixed with “In auditing, .” They destimulate whatever has been restimulated. "},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"L. RON HUBBARD Founder 167 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 4 JUNE AD13 Central Orgs Missions ROUTINE 3 HANDLING GPMS The GPM (of the Helatrobus Implants) that is handled properly is very easy to run and the results delight the pc. When errors are made and the GPM is mishandled by the auditor, the pc becomes lethargic, ARC breaky and apparent gains are minimal. As soon as an auditor realizes this and gets alert on his technical, he or she has no trouble getting RIs to RR, the pc has no ARC breaks and succeeding GPMs get easier and easier to audit. A pc being run on these GPMs who develops mass, becomes exhausted or ARC breaky, is simply being run with certain definite R3 errors. Make up your mind to this and you’ll begin to be alert when the pc starts running poorly. A pc running poorly on GPMs has had one or more of the following R3 errors committed: 1. Run without preparation on ARC processes (only true when GPMs can’t be found and made to RR). 2. A wrong goal found (by wrong wording of a right goal or just a completely wrong goal). 3. Being run on a goal too early in the series too soon, or getting into second series when first series remains. 4. When goal A is found as “the pc’s goal,” the auditor then runs another goal (true of pc’s who have had earlier goals found). 5. That which is restimulated is not discharged. (Finding several goals without discharging them, or scanning over banks.) 6. Running with RIs which differ from the basic line plot (such as “Absolutely” for Absoluteably, or “No” for Nix. There are no divergences from the HCO Bulletin line plot form). 7. Failure to do the end goal oppose list properly (the crime of having 2 or more RRing items on same list in nulling). (Always find the next goal formally by list except when pc can see it, and even then check it.) 8. Incorrect top oppterm for the goal. (Always list a page on “What would be the final achievement of this goal” and properly null it, unless a published block form issued after this date exists for it.) 168 9. Incorrect block RIs diverging from pattern. "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"10. Wrong word or sequence form for one or more RIs. 11. Failure to discharge an RI (grinding it out, not blowing it with one or more dial wide disintegrating RRs). 12. Failure to spot bypassed charge at once and thus not caring promptly for ARC breaks. 13. Forcing the pc on after an ARC break without locating the bypassed charge, or running a pc who is in trouble session after session without finding what charge was bypassed. 14. Running a doped off pc without pulling missed withholds (the only cause of dope off). 15. Failing to follow 3N remedies for lack of RR in that exact sequence given in the HCO Bulletin, and harassing the pc for non- RRing RIs. 16. Demanding more data than the pc can give on the facsimiles. 17. Failure to follow the Auditor’s Code. 18. Programing incorrectly. ARC BREAKS The most frequent cause of ARC breaks and case deterioration are: 1. Failure to complete a goal oppose list; 2. Bypassing an RI; 3. Bypassing (skipping) a GPM; 4. Wrong top oppterm; 5. Restimulating more goals than are run; 6. Departure from pattern; 7. Bad programing. All these add up to bypassed charge, of course. But the above seven are the specific offenders which give even a skilled auditor trouble. Carelessness on these points can eat up all the immediate case gain. Note: This is the most frequent list, not the most dangerous or important which includes wrong goal. NEXT GOAL 169 The next goal should be found by a formal last goal oppose list, list 50 items beyond last RR or R/ S, completed to a clean needle, only one item RRing on nulling. All the rules of listing exist here, full valid. Failure to follow them will cause a skip of or failure to find the next goal."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" If this list does not have the next goal on it, the pc will ARC break. Sometimes a pc can see the next goal and it is it. In such cases, the goal oppose list is only one item long. But it is still a list and it does have the next goal on it. TOP OPPTERM The most insidious offender in wrecking pc’s is a wrong top oppterm. If a guaranteed list of block items exists for the goal, use it. But if no such block item list exists, you must do a list for the top oppterm on the question: “What would be the final achievement of this goal?” Unless a pc random lists foolishly, the list should be about a half a page long with a clean needle. It is then routinely nulled and the BMRs put in on the 2 or 3 items that stayed in. This is however all very tricky as the second series of GPMs has things in them that could read as top oppterms for the first series. So always conclude a top oppterm list by confirming by meter that the resultant word from the list is a first series top oppterm. DIRTY NEEDLE Sometimes in trying to locate the bypassed charge causing an ARC break, the pc’s needle is so dirty that it almost can’t be read. However there is a way to read it. When the correct bypassed charge is located and indicated the needle will go beautifully clean. ______________ PROGRAMING There is much technology now on programing which will soon be released. Programing is what you audit on a pc and how to establish it. I only wish to note here that for several reasons, the best programing for the Helatrobus Implants for a pc who can be made to RR on “to forget” is as follows: Run right “down” from the GPM “to forget” (including its GPM) and right on out the gates of heaven, doing a proper goal oppose list at the end of every GPM you complete. There are only about 10 GPMs more or less from “to forget” to the heaven implant and they are all easy ones to run. When the pc backs out the gates of heaven an enormous reality results from the orientation achieved. 170 Follow the precautions in this HCO Bulletin and you will have no trouble and the pc will feel great. "},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"If you start forward (to the 1st implant GPM), I now find after experience with a lot of pcs, you restimulate too much. The pc always has a live goal (restimulated) before and behind and it’s uncomfortable. In backing the pc down you are following the pc’s natural tendency and it’s easier. Further, all the GPM’s after “to forget” (and including it) are a breeze. “To forget” is usually the basic GPM on stairs. The fancy GPMs are all earlier (closer to the first one) and have spinning plates, fast rides etc., in them. They are not hard if the pc has the last 10 GPMs of the first series run first. The more GPMs you restimulate and don’t discharge, the more uncomfortable the pc will become and the less apparent gain per GPM. I have now found and run the earliest GPMs “to be dead,” which is followed by “to be hurt,” “to experience nothing,” “to be unbalanced” and “to be unconscious” and believe these are the standard sequence for all pcs in the first series. But they are pretty strong for a pc who hasn’t had the end GPMs from “to forget” to “to be in heaven” discharged. ______________ SUMMARY 1. The Helatrobus Implants run give enormous case gain session by session if run with attention to the points given in this HCO Bulletin. 2. They give, when run without the points in this HCO Bulletin cared for, a hard, exhausting struggle that is very slow going and wearing on both auditor and pc. 3. No matter how they’re run they give case gain. It’s mainly a question of maintaining the thetan’s morale and saving auditing time. It can take more than five times as long to run these implants if it is not done with this HCO Bulletin’s view. And the pc can get pretty sick. So for a comfortable run, easy on auditor and pc alike, and five times as fast or more, apply these technical points very carefully indeed. I speak form great experience in this matter. On the question, do they have to be run, the answer is yes. Without running them the track remains too heavily burdened for the pc to get earlier with full perception. So there is the barricade. You won’t find a new fad removing it. It can only be done smoothly by skilled auditing such as that done at Saint Hill. They may have implanted heaven, but it’s hell to run, especially when you ignore the fine points. L.

Procedure: Coach uses pencil as needle and produces ticks, falls, RRs, etc., on certain items in answer to, the question asked by the student.

Each item is called out 3 times and the Big Mid Ruds are put in on the 2 or 3 items that stayed in. The student writes each item down. When the top oppterm is found it must be confirmed by “meter”, that is, it is a first series top oppterm. Patter: The student asks coach:- “What would be the final achievement of this goal?” (To catch catfish) When the top oppterm has or has not been found the coach asks the following questions: ( 1) Was the needle clean when you finished Listing? (2) Did you put the big mid ruds in on the 2 or 3 items that stayed in? (3) Did the item that stayed in RR? (4) Did you confirm by meter that it was a first series oppterm? Training stress:- If the student shows any uncertainty or comm lags during the drill, the coach asks “What happened?” LISTING AND NULLING TO FIND THE NEXT GOAL Purpose: To train the student how to find the next goal to be run. Position: Coach and student seated facing each other. The student has an E- Meter in front of him. It is not switched on. Procedure: The coach uses pencil as needle and during the drill produces rocket reads and rockslams on certain goals. Student writes down each goal on paper. Nulling is not commenced until 50 goals have been listed beyond last RR or RS and the needle is clean. If coach produces a dirty needle when student starts nulling, or more than one RR or RS, or an RR and RS, the student must then ask for more goals immediately. Patter: Student asks coach “What goal would To Catch Catfish oppose?” When list is complete the student nulls the list by calling each item 3 times. This is done until one goal remains in that RRs. When goal has or has not been found, the coach says “Thats it” and asks the following questions: (1) Did you list 50 items beyond the last RR or RS? (2) Was the needle clean when you finished listing? (3) Was the needle clean during nulling? "},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"(4) If the needle dirties up during nulling, what should you do? (Ask for more goals) (5) If more than one RR or RS or an RR or RS appear during nulling, what should you do? (Ask for more goals) (6) Did the needle dirty up? (7) Did you see more than one RR or RS during the nulling? 172 (8) What happened? (9) What did you do? (10) Did you find the next goal? Training stress:- If the student shows any uncertainty or comm lags during the drill, the coach asks “What happened?” 3N LISTING TR Student and coach have a copy each of the line plot. Use goal such as TO CATCH CATFISH. The coach uses a pencil as the meter needle and indicates to the student motions he will make to indicate a tick, choked RR and disintergrating RR etc. The coach runs the TR as per session instructions in HCO Bulletin May 13, 1963. At any time, if the student shows any hesitation, the coach asks “What happened?” When the student has found one or more items the coach says “Thats it” and asks the following questions: (1) Did you ask the correct command? (2) Did I give you the correct item? (3) If the item RRs what do you do? (Say “thank you, I’ll read the item”, then check to see if all charge is off) (4) If there is any other reaction what do you do and in what order? (Ask (1) “What happened?” (2) Supress and Invalidate off the meter (3) Random list (5) What was the needle reaction when I gave you the item? (6) What did you do? (7) What was the needle reaction when you read back the item? (8) What did you do? "},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"(9) Did you get all the charge off the item? (10) How could you tell all the charge was off? MISSED WITHHOLDS The student sits opposite coach. Student runs “Do birds fly?” or “Do fish swim?” on the coach. The coach runs the process for a while and then dramatises missed withhold manifestation. Student then locates missed withhold. The student may ask the coach any missed withhold question and ask it on “the meter” (coachs finger or pencil indicates reads). If, however, the ARC break is not showing on “the meter” the student has to dig to find it and clear the missed withhold. When this is done the coach asks the following questions: (1) What is a missed withhold? (A nearly found out) (Anothers persons actions) (2) Did you find out what had been done that had been missed? (3) Did you find out when it was? (4) Did you find out who missed it? (5) Did you find out what it was the other person did that made them wonder if they knew? (6) Did you find out whether or not it had been missed by anyone else - auditor, etc.? (7) Have you cleaned up the missed withhold? (8) When has a missed withhold been cleared up?

Correct HCOB 17 April 1963 as follows: Omit introductory paragraphs and Points of Interest. Substitute the text of this HCO Bulletin. In the pattern, change “Beings (People) (Those) who never goal” to BEINGS WHO NEVER GOAL. Change “A Being (someone) who never goals.” to A BEING WHO IS NEVER GOALING. Omit “( Someone)” wherever it appears in the pattern. Change “Fervent Believers in Goaling” to ANY FERVENT BELIEVERS IN GOALING. Change “No Goalishness” to NO BEING GOALISHNESS for the BE form of goal. Change “ Some Bad Condition Dependent on next goal” to THE NEXT GOAL PLUS NO or NOT PLUS THIS GOAL. In the example- “To Create” change oppterm “Creationishness” to CREATINGISHNESS and make other pattern changes as indicated above. TEXT FOR HCO BULLETIN THE AIRCRAFT DOOR GOALS This goal pattern (HCO Bulletin of 17 April 1963 as changed) was in use in an aircraft- type set between 315 trillion years ago and 216 trillion years ago and less, and is the pattern which precedes the Helatrobus Implants in this galaxy. It remains to be seen if all preclears have it. The goals were given with one or more goals in a series, usually one, and that goal"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"was To Create. The preclear possibly has this goal several times during this period. 180 It was given in the mocked- up fuselage of an aircraft with the thetan fixed before an aircraft door. (There are also two or more aircraft fuselages used in the Helatrobus Implants, but the preclear moved through them, was not fixed in them.) The date is the way to tell the pattern. The Helatrobus Implants existed only between 52 trillion and 38 trillion years ago, the total life span of the Helatrobus government. If the goal is found to lie earlier, between 315 trillion and 216 trillion or later, up to 52 trillion years ago, then it is probably this pattern. The goal items were laid in with explosions. THE GORILLA GOALS This same pattern, but given in an amusement park with a single tunnel, a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel, was used between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago, a long span. The symbol of a Gorilla was always present in the place the goal was given. Sometimes a large gorilla, black, was seen elsewhere than the park. A mechanical or a live gorilla was always seen in the park. This activity was conducted by the Hoipolloi, a group of operators in meat body societies. They were typical carnival people. They let out concessions for these implant “Amusement Parks.” A pink- striped white shirt with sleeve garters was the uniform of the Hoipolloi. Such a figure often rode on the roller coaster cars. Monkeys were also used on the cars. Elephants sometimes formed part of the equipment. The Hoipolloi or Gorilla goals were laid in with fantastic motion. Blasts of raw electricity and explosions were both used to lay the items in. The series is always five goals. These are very simple goals, no long words. To End, To be Dead, To be Asleep, To be Solid, To Create, To Find, To be Visible, To be Sexual (not To have Sex as some pcs give it), To be Invisible, To Postulate and a very few more were used, always five goals in a series. The series usually started with To be Dead, but To End, To Sleep and To be Asleep must also be investigated as the first goal of each series. The pattern in HCOB 17 Apr. AD 13 is correct for all of these goals, as changed in this HCO Bulletin. THE BEAR GOALS From about 256 trillion trillion years ago to about 370 trillion trillion years ago the GPMs are the Bear Goals. These use the same pattern, similar amusement park arrangements, the same type of goals as the Gorilla Goals. The only real difference is that instead of a mechanical gorilla a mechanical or live bear was used, and the motion was even more violent. "},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"181 There is, however, a change of pattern in the Bear Goals in that TWO RIs were added. These come as a pair just below “The Vast Value of Goaling.” They are oppterm “Any worries about being or goaling” opposed by terminal “A worried goaler.” Aside from this addition, the pattern is the same as the Gorilla Goals. Mostly raw electric sprays are used in the Bear Goals to drive in the items. The Bear Goals were handled by a group called, I think, “The Brothers of the Bear” and were the ancestors of the Hoipolloi. THE BLACK THETAN GOALS From about 390 trillion trillion years to 370 trillion trillion years ago, the Black Thetan goals were given. These were given in a glade surrounded by the stone heads of “black thetans” who spat white energy at the trapped thetan. The trapped thetan was motionless. The pattern is the earliest “To” form of GPM now known. There were six RIs per goal, consisting of: Accomplished Not Accomplished Action (ing) Never Action (ing) Goal Not Goal There were from 15 to 18 goals in the series, all of a simple nature such as To End, To be Dead, To be Asleep, etc. The full series will be published at a later date but is easily reconstructed, always following the same pattern of six. THE INVISIBLE PICTURE GOALS From somewhere around 110,000 trillion trillion years ago or earlier to 390 trillion trillion years ago, the most difficult GPMs on the track were given. These contain four RIs per set, positive- negative in dichotomy, (example: Wake, Never Wake, Sleep, Never Sleep), the four given five times for every one picture shown. This makes 20 firings per picture. But the first picture is invisible and the thetan afterwards is not expected to find then the first twenty firings of RIs (four in a row, repeated five times). This makes a “vacuum” for a picture and groups the bank. This type of implant is probably the source of vacuums in the reactive mind. 182 The remaining pictures vary during different periods of the sequence, but consist usually of a scene of a cave, a railway, an airplane, a view of a sun and planets. The first “picture” making the total number of five is invisible and is no picture. The pictures have a moving object in each (except the invisible one) which backs up halfway through the series. The trick is to get the RIs out of the invisible picture, particularly the basic first four. The RIs also fire right left, then left right so that the “Never” RI the next time has swapped sides. They go positive, negative, then, with swapped sides, positive negative. They are simple aberrative words. Start, Never Start, End, Never End are always the"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"first firings, followed by Begin, Never Begin, Stop, Never Stop for the second whole series of firings. The same four run through all five pictures. Then the next four go through all five, etc. There are many words used. Early in the series 3- dimensional sets were used, late in the series only 2- dimensional pictures were employed. ______________ There may be earlier GPM- type implants but the Goal idea does not go back earlier evidently than 390 trillion trillion years- in the “Black Thetan” Implants. Earlier material is only positive, negative and dichotomies according to present data. But the earlier ones are more aberrative to the pc. ______________ PROGRAMING The trick is to run a full series through on any of these as found, no matter how late it is in the period, then find the first time the series was given the pc and run the complete series. Then get the next earlier type of series and do the same thing. Your pc may not have been in the areas where these patterns were used and may have different types of implants. If so, make sure first that the implant you have found does not contain one of these patterns before going to the hard labor of trying to make one up with the pc. LATER DAY IMPLANTS Between 38 trillion years ago and present time a lot of off- beat implants can be found. They sometimes have only pictures, sometimes only items, sometimes items and pictures both. They are usually short, often have no goal in them, only positive- negative commands, and are not hard to work out. The pc can usually get them easily if they’re on his assessed R3R chain. ______________ 183 WARNING In a complex GPM pattern almost anything can be made to fire until the exact RI is found. Then no RR is left. Wrong RIs leave white mass and eventually crumple up the engram. Missed RIs leave black strips or patches. Partially discharged RIs leave gray patches. Restimulated but not run RIs turn everything black in the picture. Scan a pc through RIs you don’t suspect and it all goes black. Get a wrong date or wrong duration and the pc has no visio or pictures that don’t belong there. ______________ SUMMARY This is a rapid resume of principal GPMs on the track. Where the pattern applies it must be done exactly as given. (Note: All trillions used are US trillions which are 1,000 million.)"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":" L. RON HUBBARD Founder 184 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF JULY 17, 1963 Central Orgs Tech Directors Franchise for info ERRORS IN RUNNING 3N The following dispatch sent to Ron by Guy Eltringham, D of P Los Angeles, points out errors observed in running 3N, and may be of value to other Orgs: Re: Probable Field and Org alter- is on the running of 3- N. On my return here I found the following errors (among others) being committed in the running of 3N by the HGC auditors (and even worse in the staff co- audit); I fear they may be occurring elsewhere. 1. Confusions in the blue Line Plot. (HCO Technical Form of May 26, AD13) (a) In block two - goal being directly added into blue Line Plot which already has “TO” written in - producing e. g. ABSOLUTABLE TO TO Forget, NIX ABSOLUTABLE TO TO Forget etc. (Very common, and apparently getting some sort of RR’s on them when “found” (in great numbers)). Also To To Forgetting etc., in the 149 - 160 band. (b) In block five - inserting the “ing” form of the goal in the blank while an “ing” is sitting on the line already - producing e. g. Those Who Are Forgeting ing, Someone Who Isn’t Ever Forgetting ing. (there is no extra “ing”) (c) In block six - incorporating the “er” into the “oppterm” side - producing - The Exhaustion Of Forgetering, The Stupidity of Forgetering. (There isn’t any “er” on the oppterm side) (d) In block five and block six - attempting to form the “ing” form of the goal by adding “ing” to the goal minus to (which as fas as I can see would only occur at item 163 - 164). Thus producing many items with a section reading such as “Go Awaying”, not “Going Away” and “Be In Heavening”, not “Being In Heaven”. Even though the earlier Line Plot (red) has the “ing” form of these goals indicated in the block. 2. Re- running GPMs after they had been run through to bottom oppterm rather than finding next goal and going on (one poor sob had partly run GPMs (first 3) and then “To Be In Heaven” (run as next goal in series).

With the discovery of the relationship of time and the tone arm, I immediately went to work to see if any eager loops had used time confusion in order to immobilize and incapacitate a thetan. I found almost at once that false timing of incidents was not only used but very nearly specialized in. The exact character of the between- lives implants only then came to view and could be mapped, and other implants of earlier times were disclosed. Entire false pasts and futures have been installed and even actual dates and incidents have been grouped. This is good news rather than bad news for it gives one a measure of the effort necessary to keep a thetan aberrated and gives us the reason some persons won’t RR or get TA motion who otherwise might, for all GPMs may be falsely dated and if correctly dated might run. This does not mean that R3N or R3R are in any way changed or that one does not run GPMs. It does mean that a slight variation in R3R is needed when false track is found in order to make the dating easier on it. This will be called R3T. It consists of R3R plus clever methods of dating that get past implanted dates. Meanwhile, be very careful in dating. No dates released on anything may be accurate including the Helatrobus Implants. I’m sorry if this held anybody back. But as usual you know as soon as I know. So carry on. Get TA action on your pc. But be very cautious about accepting dates without checking “Is this incident and date in a false past? Is this incident and date in a false future?” The best trick is to find if “Right now” or, as in the between- lives implants, “The year zero” exists in the false track and date it. “Was the year zero hundreds of years ago, thousand . . ., etc.” Clever, eh? Some of you have been groaning about these skillions of trillions of years. They’re usually found early on in auditing only on false track. Good hunting. L.

As the preclear is moved back on his time track beyond trillions three, you will find that incidents and reliable items contain less charge proportionately to the pc (who was stronger then) and that the pc’s postulates made then contained more charge. In short as you go earlier on the time track, the incidents seemed weaker to the pc then and the pc, being more capable, had stronger postulates. Thus it is not uncommon to find a GPM on the early track producing only falls on the pc and the pc’s postulates made at that time rocket reading (or falling). This, in fact, gets even more disproportionate so that on the very early track you might find that running RIs out of a GPM produces no TA motion, but taking the pc’s postulates out produces a TA blow down that “goes through 7” (around the whole TA dial and back up). In my recent surveys of the tone arm and its relationship to auditing, it became apparent that three types of charge existed in a GPM. 1. Charge as an engram. 2. Charge as reliable items. 3. Charge as postulates. All three must be removed from a GPM. Any incident, wherever it is on the track, contains postulates (comments, considerations, directions) made by the pc at that time. Thus in all incidents the pc’s postulates must be called for and removed. To remove a postulate from any incident, have the pc repeat it until it no longer reacts on the needle of the meter. If it comes down to a persistent tick get suppress off it and get it repeated again, just as in the case of any RI in a GPM. 189 DON’T LEAVE POSTULATES CHARGED. Treat them like GPM items whether in a GPM or an engram. Add to your ARC break L lists L3 and L4, “Have we bypassed any postulates? “ There are implants which tell the pc not to erase his own postulates. There is also a Bear Series Goal “To Postulate.”"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":" Sometimes the postulate lies ahead of the actual engram in R3R. Example: A man decides to get hurt, then enters into an engramic situation. The engram does not wholly free until the postulate is removed. Occasional calling for “any postulates, considerations or comments you had in this incident” while running R3R engrams or R3N will keep the incident going well. When the pc says one, have him or her repeat it until it no longer reacts on the needle. I bring this up at this time as I have found a case that got no TA action on engrams or GPMs or RRs on RIs until the postulates were given special attention, at which time TA action of an excellent kind occurred. SUMMARY A stuck TA is always caused by running the pc above the pc’s tolerance of charge. You can stop any TA by ramming the pc into incident after incident without cleaning them up. A postulate is only one kind of charge. At any position on the time track also look for the pc’s postulates. Early on the time track expect them to occasionally “blow the meter apart.” Flatten any postulate found by getting it repeated until the reaction is gone off the needle. And all charge, of course, on anything, whether falls or RRs, must be removed from engrams or GPMs. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 190 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 24 AUGUST AD 13 Central Orgs Missions SCIENTOLOGY FOUR ROUTINE 3N THE TRAIN GPMs THE MARCAB BETWEEN LIVES IMPLANTS This is a rough, fast survey of the Train GPMs and the Between Lives Implants and the pattern used. The data involved in all this is of great scope and as it concerns all the peoples of Earth, considerable more work will be done on it. As these are the most involved and low- toned implants on the time track, it is recommended that other earlier GPMs be completed before the Between Lives material is tackled. After all tone arm action is the important thing and any earlier GPM that gives it makes the Between Lives Implants and Train GPMs easier to run. So program for earlier GPMs. However, pcs do get into the Between Lives Implants and do connect with the GPMs there and in the Train GPMs, so the pattern and data is released. Where possible run earlier GPMs. In any event, a safe rule is to run whatever GPM you can get your hands on and date as little as possible in 3N. THE TRAIN GOALS"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":" These are given to the being on his first contact with the Marcab Invasion Force in this sector of the universe. Thus the Train GPMs date from hundreds of years ago to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Earlier on the track there are lots of trains such as in the Invisible Picture GPMs. So the mere existence of a train in the implant doesn’t make it the Train Implants. This is established by date. The implanting is done from a huge train station. The announcer, through speakers on the platform, gives continual running fire of wrong dates and directions, and orders to depart and return to this point, and “you don’t know when this happened to you.” A lot of hellos and goodbyes and false information. 191 The being is put in a railway carriage quite like a British railway coach with compartments. Speakers are to the right and left in the compartment. The train is backed up rapidly through eight pairs of stands (eight on either side of the track, sixteen in all.) These spray white energy against the side of the carriage. None of the white energy touches the pc. One pair of RIs fires during the whole backward run between the stands and then, reversing in the speakers, fires all the way forward again. One pair of RIs in the pattern, then, fires a complete round trip. Then the next pair fire for a complete round trip (forward and back) and so on. There are then sixteen repeats for each pair, 8 forward and 8 back, before the next pair. The pattern is as follows: (List for oppterm. Remaining terms use the whole phrase of the goal “To Be Oppterm - NOT (Oppterm) All (+ complete goal) Nothing (complete goal) Best (+ complete goal) Not Best (complete goal) Inevitable ( + complete goal) Questionable (complete goal) Doubted ( + complete goal) Certain (complete goal) Accursed ( + complete goal) - Commendable (complete goal) Unforgivable ( + complete goal) Forgivable (complete goal) Hopeless ( + complete goal) Hopeful (complete goal) (Single RI) That’s your goal. At the start of each goal (or pair perhaps) a face may come up and say “You still here? Get out. Get off this train. We hate you.” And from the speakers “This happened to you yesterday, tomorrow, now. This is your departure point, keep coming back. You’ll be meeting all your friends here. When you’re killed and dead keep coming back. You haven’t a chance to get away. You’ve got to report in. This happened to you days ago, weeks ago, years ago. You don’t know when this happened to you. We hate you. Get out. Don’t ever come back.” There’s a lot more of this including how you’ll be pulled and pulled when you’re"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"dead until you come back. A lot of wrong dates are also thrown in. The type of goal is of the worst negative dichotomy. To Be Caught. To Be Wrong. To Go Away. To Commit Suicide. Etc. The GPM “To End” begins the series. There is a large number of GPMs in the series. This series may have been given the pc on entrance to the Marcab Confederacy plus or minus 200,000 years ago, and then again much later just before the first Between Lives Implant as a preliminary step before the actual Between Lives Implant. It is therefore important to run these Train GPMs before trying to run the Between Lives Implant itself, for all these GPMs are repeated again in the Between Lives Implant. 192 In running these Train GPMs, be sure to get the first pair on their first fire. There is a standard swinging arm crossing signal that sounds at the end of each run of the train. Trains play a large part in implanting. There are lots of pictures of them, lots of rails way earlier than the Train GPMs. But no earlier ones are given inside a coach. This is what makes it nightmarish- the white energy only hits the coach sides, not the pc. The rush of the train puts heavy Kinesthetic into the engram. The goals “To Start” “To Stop” “To Change” make the pc feel he can’t control the train. To Be Unable. To Be Instantaneous. Various perceptions are all in this series of Train GPMs. If it’s bad, it’s there. THE BETWEEN LIVES IMPLANT This implant properly has six parts. l. Pc’s actual death (not in first one given). 2. First screen section (to left) giving a false death, many GPMs calculated to obliterate memory and group the time track, and some pictures containing groupers. This says it is 15 days long. 3. The main screen purporting to give the future trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years from the year zero. On this the pc’s past implants get stuck up. 4. The “Next Hundred Days.” A screen on the right of the main screen giving a number of positive dichotomy GPMs to fit the negative dichotomy goals on the first screen section (2). This also contains a false projection to Earth “into a baby” complete with sonic on the delivery room (a home bedroom with oatmeal wall paper or the current fashion on Earth.) 5. The actual kickoff from the implant station (not by projection to Earth but being dumped on Earth.) 6. The actual search for a baby. The main screen is a long white board with a grate near the top all the way along. There is a roar in the whole place like blowers going. Huge numbers of earlier GPMs stack up on (2). Lots of earlier implants stack up on the main screen. The whole operation is a huge grouper. But given good TA action, it all eventually flies apart, especially if many earlier GPMs and the Train GPMs are run first with good TA action. The pc has had at least two series of Train Implants and perhaps as many as 300"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Between Lives Implants in the last many thousands of years. Therefore the way to program all this is to run mainly earlier GPMs on the pc, then the Train GPMs, then any more earlier GPMs that can be found and then the Between Lives Implants. The Between Lives Implants (and the Train GPMs) have the full intention of installing a compulsion to return and a feeling the pc can be reached by them and be pulled about, and wiping out all memory of former life. 193 But any pc can be run on earlier GPMs in spite of all this. The reason this and other “screen implants” acts as a grouper is because it restimulates earlier track charge which then, pushing forward toward PT, crushes the incidents and GPMs on the screen. Of course it is all “wrong dated” and “wrong durationed.” And this contributes to the crush of the material toward PT. But basically it is simply restimulated charge on the early track that presses toward PT and shoves the pc into the screen implant. Therefore if you just restimulate and do not run early track GPMs when found, eventually you will find your pc crushed up against recent times and in these Between Lives screens (if life and these screen incidents have not already done it). This is the secret of the amnesia: Restimulate enough early track charge and do not discharge it and the being will have amnesia on the whole track. If you are monkeying about on the backtrack and just partially discharging incidents, going on to something new all the time, failing to run a series of GPMs completely when you find them, after a while, past track will become unreal to the pc. Then it will blot out and vanish and you will only have these Between Lives type of implants to work with. Then if you flub them, your pc’s pictures will disappear. THE DANGER SIGNAL IS DECREASING TA ACTION. This all occurs on the mechanism of early track restimulation, compounded with wrong dates and wrong durations. So the way to handle any pc is to locate or spring off the bank early GPMs or implants and run them fully. Lack of Tone Arm action may upset this program but it is mainly GPMs that stick tone arms since they stall time. A pc is in danger if earlier track is becoming less real or is vanishing or the bank is pressing forward and landing on screens. The remedy is take what was already restimulated earlier, particularly GPMs, any GPMs, and run them thoroughly (1) As GPMs (2) As engrams and (3) As pc’s postulates. This discharges them. Keep this up, be thorough. Don’t restimulate more than you discharge fully. And the pc’s pictures will come back on and the track go straight again. The above gives you the right way to handle the Between Lives Implants. Peel off the GPMs from it (meaning early track GPMs restimulated on it and visible on the screen) and run them fully before taking something else off the screen to run. Thus one does not really run a Between Lives Implant until very late on a case. The auditor uses it when it appears on a case (l) to realize that the earlier track has"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"been restimulated too much and too little discharged from it and (2) to find earlier GPMs to run. Excessive restimulation and flopping about on the early track and running nothing clean will inevitably bring the pc forward and up against the Between Lives Implants. 194 So the auditor who restimulates and does not run early track material when found is doing a dangerous thing. The Between Lives Implants create amnesia only because they restimulate early track and don’t discharge it. If they didn’t do this they would not produce the same effect. Therefore auditing undoes this mechanism only when early track incidents are thoroughly run when contacted. The worst sinner is the GPM. So never fail to run any early track GPM completely when found, with its whole series. Don’t go skipping about. Going earlier. Omitting goals, leaving a GPM incompletely discharged. Otherwise you will make the acquaintance with the Between Lives Implant area. If you know of any early GPM series left unhandled on the pc, run it completely before restimulating anything else. And if you are running the Between Lives Implant grab off of it any earlier GPM or incident you can find and take it early and run it. Don’t stay with the screen. Peel things off it that are earlier and run them. Otherwise the pc’s bank will feel like crumbling forward into PT like an avalanche. This mechanism of the production of unawareness by restimulating but not running charge on the early track is itself an important discovery. It forbids then browsing through the early track, a sip here, a datum there. Be thorough or crash, out goes the lights, into PT slides the pc with a thousand volts driving him on. If you know of any early track GPM on your pc that can be run with tone arm motion clean it up as a GPM, clean up all the GPMs in that series, run it as an engram, run any and all postulates out of it, get it clean and then find something else. The cycle of a pc in total amnesia at start of auditing would be (if audited with good TA action): 1. Contacts yesterday 2. Contacts this life 3. Contacts childhood 4. Contacts a past life 5. Contacts incidents on this planet in the past few thousand years 6. Contacts early track 7. Contacts lots of early track and GPMs 8. Contacts earlier GPMs. 9. Contacts very early material"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":" 195 10. Continues to clean up track 11. Contacts reasons for making pictures 12. Goes OT. If you try to rush this by practicing unthoroughness from (5) on, then when pc reaches (9) above you will suddenly find him on the Between Life screens. You will have overcharged early track and failed to discharge it and the result will be: 8. Contacts earlier GPMs but has trouble holding position on the track to run them and is ARC breaky; 9a. Contacts earlier material but it groups and scrunches and sticks together; 10a. Collides with screen implants like the Between Lives (there are earlier ones); 11a. Can’t keep pictures apart, things easily wrong dated and is very ARC breaky and is stuck in Between Lives; 12a. Can’t reach the early track and at session starts is found to be stuck in this lifetime. There is no shortcut back to finding when he started to “make pictures.” The phenomenon of early charge pushing the pc back toward PT if not run defeats any such attempt. So making an OT is keeping the TA going with itsa line in and being thorough on early track incident running. If the pc has gotten into condition (12a) above or is approaching it, don’t waste time on endless dating. Just find any early GPM already partially run (the earliest one you can lay your hands on without restimulating others) and run it completely. Then find another and another. And shun all new material until you have completely handled the old. And don’t let the pc wander around on the early track. Just find and run GPMs and clean up fully whatever you find. Or you’ll be sitting there reading this HCOB despairingly trying to get your pc off a Between Lives screen. Even if these listed evils occur, however, you have not lost the TA action already gained, if misguidedly, on the case and the matter is easily repaired providing you redo what you’ve left undone and this time be neat and restimulate the case otherwise as little as possible. He or she is still closer to OT. They were just making it the hard way. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 196 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 28 SEPTEMBER 1963 (Amplifies HCO Bulletin of 8 May 1963) Missions All Saint Hill Graduates Scientology Four Important "},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"ACTUAL GOALS (This HCO Bulletin should be of great interest to older Saint Hill Graduates) The actual goals and items of the preclear are several thousand times more aberrative than implant GPMs. I have covered the entire scope of implanted goals and implants in general and we are fortunate to have all this material. An auditor must know it to cope with Class IV auditing as these implant GPMs become confused with actual Goals Problem Masses on a meter. Further, the implanted GPM gives the student auditor a marvelous training ground for running actual GPMs, and it is recommended that the implant GPM be studied and some of them run before the auditor tries to handle actual GPMs. Furthermore, it was wise to know all the tricks “out there” before we went. So I had to collect them for you. Confusion between implant and actual GPMs occurs because the implanters used types of goals and patterns found in actual GPMs. Implanters obviously had a knowledge, from historical record or even research, of what a thetan’s own goals look like but obviously they never developed the data to a workable therapy or they probably would not have continued to be driven to such costly expedients as continuous implanting, between lives installations, etc. The highest level of treatment technology known to exist in the universe before Scientology was Pictureology wherein, at a signal from the therapist, the thetan crunched up the engram. This is currently in use (and has been for many trillions of years) in the Galactic Confederation. There are few further complications to it except putting the thetan under control with sleep lights. Pictureology is very close to implanting. The practitioner gets a picture of the scene of the accident, holds it before the thetan and snaps a pair of bars, not unlike cine clap sticks, before the thetan. The thetan eventually gets the idea and angrily or otherwise duplicates the action of the stick by crunching his own engram. There are numerous kinds of traps and ways of catching and freezing a thetan. These are categorized as Projectile which shoot a thetan, usually with beams or lights; Luring which cause a thetan to inspect; Pole which trap a thetan with his own energy; Prison which imprison the thetan; and Maze which confuse a thetan. Temperature and perhaps chemicals are used to paralyze a thetan once caught. All other mental activities are done by implanting. Screen implants cause the thetan to put his pictures up on a screen where they are misdated and scrambled. Picture implants simply show the thetan pictures which he recoils from or takes to be his own. Picture implants are also occasionally filled with false dates. They give the thetan false pasts and futures. They often repeat the actual beginning and ending of the incident in picture form, making it hard to get before or after the implant as one sees pictures of his arrival and departure and so thinks he is not into the implant or out of it. Goal implants are the third and most serious type of implant. They take a goal and pattern of items with left and right firing poles or jets and implant terminals and opposition terminals. 197 The pattern is a too regular GPM not unlike a thetan’s own GPMs. This confuses the thetan as to his own goals and seeks to scramble his own goals and items. The implanted GPM gets confused into the thetan’s own GPMs and often in running a thetan’s own goals and items one gets into implant goals or items and vice versa. One only needs to straighten it out by carefully asking on the meter if this is an"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"installed goal or items or an actual one. The things one runs for gain today on the pc are: 1. R1C (Itsa Line) . 2. R2T (dating somatics). 3. R2H (ARC breaks). 4. R3SC (Service Facsimile Clearing). 5. R4M2 (formerly R3M2). Finding goals is done via R3SC. R4M2 listing takes the first RR on the item list. The auditor stops the pc and reads the item and says “Is this your item” and concludes then the usual R3M2 steps. The change of designation from R3 to R4 is to agree with the new levels of Scientology. All Routine 3 materials are now called Routine 4 because it belongs in Level 4 (OT). Engram Running by Chains remains R3 and is used for this lifetime. R3N (Running Implant Goals) is now R4N and is otherwise unchanged. R4M2 is unchanged except for letting the pc itsa whether or not the RRing item is his or her item. One doesn’t let the pc have an item that doesn’t rocket read on being called. ______________ It is almost amusing to note how hard implanters work and what overts they must feel they run up, and to note as well that if it were not for a thetan’s own Goals Problem Masses they could effect nothing harmful. How hard they work. And all for nothing. They are not the source of aberration. They merely make the universe seem more unpleasant. As for creating aberration, they could not. Sleep lights, screens, false- picture projectors, goal implants alike are wholly innocuous compared to the thetan’s own Goals Problem Masses. One aberrates himself. And if he did not, nobody else could. ______________ The service facsimile is in actual fact the two top reliable items of the last (present time) pc’s actual Goals Problem Mass. This does not prevent one from using R3SC. On the contrary this makes R3SC work. The pc’s present time (current) goal can be used as a service facsimile if accidentally found providing one uses it in R3SC process with “In this lifetime” appended to every command employed. 198 PROGRAMING R4M2 In programing R4M2: 1. If you find an actual correct goal of the pc, run it only if it is the present time (latest) goal on the track. If not, do goal oppose lists until you do find the present time goal. 2. Unless you’ve done a lot of RlC and R3SC on the pc the present time"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"overrestimulation keeps the present time goal (or any actual goal) from being found. 3. It is easier to find an implant goal than an actual goal, so carefully ask about it and sort out any goal on the meter. 4. Get the pc’s actual present time GPM before you do any R4M2 on it. Don’t go listing items on a backtrack GPM. 5. Start a present time actual GPM by listing for the top terminal. It’s easier to find the top terminal, for the PT GPM is usually truncated (incomplete). 6. Go on down through the GPM to the goal. 7. Find the next goal below the present time one. List the present time goal as an RI to find the top oppterm of the next goal. (Note: this step is optional. A bank can be cleaned up without finding the next goal below. NEVER include this step if your pc is getting less than 20 divs of down TA per session, as you won’t find the lower GPM until you have completed the one you’re working. So omit finding next goal on low TA motion pcs and find it ollly when all other steps are taken.) 8. Go back to the present time GPM. Read the items already found on the line plot to the pc. Take the highest one (nearest PT) that ticks. Complete the list from which it came from (not the list that opposes it or it opposes). 9. Using the new item found continue R4M2 on the current GPM. 10. When no more items exist in the top (present time) GPM, prepcheck the goal and all auditing on goals and items. 11. Go to the next GPM for which you already have the top oppterm and continue with R4M2. 12. Use the same steps used on the present time GPM to run and clean up each GPM in turn. GPMs are run from the latest (nearest present time) back down the track. Items are found from the latest (top, nearest present time) to earlier always. The pc’s reality is always greatest at the nearest to PT end of any GPM, no matter how far back they are. Overlisting lists is all that gets the pc skipping about and into other GPMs. So keep the lists very short, 5- 10 items, just until the first RR is seen. List only until the item being listed from does not tick on test. Keep the pc’s itsa line in. Let the pc say it is or isn’t his. But don’t let the pc have an item that doesn’t RR. Don’t worry the pc about tone arm or auditing actions. Let the pc run his bank, you run the session. 199 Do careffil case analysis (ARC break lists and case analysis lists- to be published)- when the case goes wrong. Find lots of reliable items. If you don’t let the pc have lots, he has nothing to itsa. Therefore you get less tone arm action.

The pc’s own line plot is quite individual, like the original line plot for “To Scream” in HCOBs. Implant GPMs are all pattern (same RIs every time). It is easy, on overlisting (or listing only by blowdown as has been tried) for the pc to skip RIs or get into wrong GPMs. The auditor must be careful not to run an actual GPM below the goal as an item and into the next GPM. The only thing that will turn off the pc’s rocket read is running items out of a GPM for which one does not have the goal. Running a backtrack GPM before the present time GPM is run (or skipping a GPM going back) sows the earlier line plot with items from the missed GPM. The pc’s current actions are always explained by the pair of items nearest present time. This is true for all GPMs no matter how far back you’ve run. The pc has only a small number of actual GPMs, less than 50. Perhaps no more than 20. The length of the time track is infinitely greater than one supposes. Trillions one hundred is not the start of track. That’s trillion written one hundred times. One seldom dates in R4M2 and only then to orient some item worrying the pc that has gotten out of place and only then by order of magnitude of years ago. Anything worrying the pc or reducing his capability or life potential is to be found in actual items or goals, not in engrams or implants. These are not primary causes. Only the pc’s own goals and items are capable of basically causing the trouble. The whole explanation of how an RI forms lies in the discussions of the service facsimile and the original explanations of the Goals Problem Mass 1962. ______________ I am sorry to have caused auditors of this period to work so hard on R3N implant goals. But without this data and understanding found between May and September of 1963 actual GPMs are impossible to handle as one gets into implants. A pc’s confront of his own GPMs is increased by running implant GPMs providing TA action occurs in sufficient quantity. After running a few implant GPMs one comes up to contempt for their aberrative value. The pc is lucky who has run a few before tackling his own GPMs. THE PC’s OWN GOALS AND ITEMS ARE THE FINAL ROAD TO OT. L.

These things are GPMs, Reliable Items, Locks on GPMs and Items, Implants, Implant Reliable Items, Locks on Implants and Implant Items, and goals of the thetan with or without Items and GPMs attached. A GPM has mass, actual mass. It has density, weight and size. It can be measured. A Reliable Item has mass, and size. Implants, Locks, and Actual Goals of the thetan have mass. This mass is caused by by the suppression of the things by the thetan. Only non- implant GPMs and RIs have any aberative value on the thetan. The others are merely confusion factors. The bank is composed of these masses and nothing else. When a GPM or RI or RIs or GPMs are pulled out of line by restimulation, and brought into present time, they impinge upon the body. When this happens in auditing we say the pc has the “creak”; when this happens in life the doctors say “he has an incurable case of lumbosis”. When one of these masses is restimulated out of line, the thetan then has a mass bearing down on him. A large, ugly, heavy, black mass. Mass that brings pressure against his body. Mass that tries to inhabit the same space the thetan is inhabiting with his body. And when two or more such masses may get restimulated - OW! Restimulation of these masses all the time in life. Auditing is handling these masses all the time - no matter what level of auditing it is! When you are having a pc simply talk about his like and liovingness (as with R1C), or you are doing R2C Slow Assessment, or you are doing R3SC, or an R4 Case Analysis - any one of these - you are handling the masses of the bank - GPMs, RIs, etc. The pc is looking at these masses no matter what you are running. 201 R4M2 is the only technology which as- ises or gets rid of these masses on the pc in any combination. Not only could a pc get the “creak” but the “croak”. Now, since the bank has it’s own snarled up ares in it, from life restimulation, already, any auditor is going to make errors running R4M2, when he runs into an already snarled up area of the bank. If the auditor is trained in R4M2, he will know how to unsnarle the bank, and correct his error. But the auditor who is not trained in R4M2, does not know how to unsnarle an already snarled bank, and who attempts to run R4M2, will run into a snarled area, make mistakes and these masses will fall in on the preclear. Result, pc with the “croak”. (Good way to make MDs rich perhaps). So the point is: no matter what you are doing with the pc, no matter what auditing technique you are using, you are handling and having the pc look at (itsa) the masses called GPMs, RIs, etc. And as long as you don’t try to run these masses out (if you are not trained in R4M2) but run R1, R2, or R3 techniques, your pc will get better and better and won’t “croak”. Stick to auditing levels I, II, III until you have been trained in R4M2. You’ll get plenty of charge off, and make keyed- out clears. And the pcs will be happy.

There are good indicators and bad indicators, but all of them are indicators. The good indicators mean that the session is progressing properly and that the next routine action should be undertaken. Good indicators abound in a properly run session. Here are some GOOD INDICATORS: Pc cheerful. Pc cogniting on items or goals. Pc’s items found are the ones the pc thought they were on the list. Pc listing items briefly and accurately. Early items on list turning out to be the right ones.

The line plot looking proper, with correct gradients, to the auditor. No vast mental effort demanded of the auditor to follow pc’s logic in why something opposes something or solves something. Pc not developing heavy PTPs or somatics between sessions or in session. ________________ The good indicator tells you things look the way they ought to look and are going the way they have to go to make an OT. When these good indicators are absent, then is the time to start doing searches, repairs, etc. In actual practice you get so used to good indicators that you don’t really think of them as indicators at all. Therefore, you keep your attention alert ~or bad indicators and when these show up you have to act and promptly. Like many other things in this universe, you don’t concentrate on the smooth, you stay alert for the rough. But it is a great mistake for an auditor to be so nervous about bad indicators that the pc is thrown into a whatsit when nothing is wrong. Things will go wrong then for sure. The rule is: Expect good indicators and go on with routine actions as long as they are present. Observe quickly and knowingly bad indicators and rapidly act with the correct response. Every bad indicator is precise, easily observed and has an exact counteraction. The speed with which a bad indicator is observed and the certainty with which it is corrected prevents the session from producing more bad indicators. Observe the trouble sign instantly. Know what to do for that exact sign instinctively. Repair swiftly. And in these points we have the whole secret of fast progress. It is not the pc who slows the session. It is the auditor’s lack of knowledge of bad indicators and their remedies. The longer a bad indicator goes unobserved and unrepaired the longer it will take to repair it. In R6 errors consume time far, far out of proportion to successes. One overlooked bad indicator can consume a month of auditing time. In that month three whole banks could have been run. But no. The month is consumed with unproductive wanderings, the pc and auditor torn to bits with stress and ARC breaks. It’s all a matter of indicators and knowing what to do. If that knowledge is poor,"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"then- well, no OT, that’s all. The road is traveled with total correctness only. It is never traveled at all when unremedied bad indicators are present. The auditor is either totally competent or totally incompetent. There are no shades of gray. One error unremedied puts the whole project on the dump heap. So the auditor has to know his business. And so does the pc. And errors can’t be let go by. 205 This is the routine of perfection. Sloppy, hope- it- will- get- by, well- it- doesn’tmatter attitudes will not make OTs. Any error passed up and neglected will within minutes or sessions wreck the lot. Miss a GPM or half a dozen items and within two banks the pc will bog completely and hopelessly and never progress further until the earlier error is remedied. It’s like having a pc on rubber bands. The pc will go down the track from an error just so far and then, as though the bands tighten to drag him back, will run slower and slower and then suddenly one is faced with a pc who can’t run at all! But these errors are not undetectable. The instant they occur a bad indicator shows up. The speed errors are remedied determines the speed of advance of the case. The don’t- care, hope- it- will- get- by, why- repair auditor just can’t audit R6 and will only seriously mess up pcs. This is the condition of the final road out. I wish it were different but it isn’t. It’s that way. An auditor can know his business. There is a finite, specific answer for every bad indicator that shows up. Therefore, an auditor, to succeed in R6, must: 1. Know basic auditing and meters and itsa like an old smoothie; 2. Know the anatomy of GPMs, RIs, and the objects of the mind and all their possible combinations like a card sharp knows cards; 3. Know the techniques of R6 like a completely relaxed one- man band; 4. Know all good indicators at a glance; 5. Know every bad indicator and its response with a bang- bang, one- two certainty that never permits a moment’s wonder as to what’s going on or what to do; 6. Know the rules of R6 rat- a- tat- tat. Given those six things, an auditor can make an OT in under a thousand hours. A weakness on any one of them will not only not make an OT but will fiendishly mess up a case. For even if you know R6 cold you will make enough mistakes to keep you very busy. The pity of it is that one must become an expert before he or she performs on an actual case. But that must be overcome. I learned it from scratch. So can you with all the data now neat before us. L.

They settle for ticks, tiny falls, etc., of the sort that can be found usually in getting mid ruds in. In all auditing up to Class V the usual meter needle read is around an eighth to a quarter of an inch long at sensitivity 16."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":" The Mark V is designed to give good serviceable reads for the lower classes of auditing and is quite wonderful at it. But the moment you enter the wide vistas of Class V, the whole character of meter needle behavior changes, you go from tiny read to big read. In Classes V and VI tiny reads are used only for mid ruds as they were in lower levels. But in all work in goals, case analysis, plotting, finding items, checking things out, etc., reads are enormous. A new horizon of metering dawns and an auditor coming up through the lower levels, entering Class V and VI work, just doesn’t believe it. Most of his early mistakes in checking out goals or finding the wrongnesses are entirely based on this. He thinks a tiny read is enough and he uses it. Whereas he really must never use a small read for this work. If a goal is a real GPM, it will read with great, intermittent, inconsistent slashes. If an analysis of a situation is brought to the right answer, the meter needle falls hugely. The trouble is that the auditor just doesn’t press on looking for the right answer and settles for ticks- because he can’t think up the right combination. The right combination “No GPM” or “Lock on an implant” will send the needle racing. All mistakes on goals or situations in Classes V and VI can be traced to a failure to appreciate that metering is different at these levels. The sensitivity at Class VI has to be kept around 4. You only use sensitivity 8 or 16 to get in since mid ruds. On all R6 work you shut the meter down. You can’t keep the needle at set if you use a sensitivity higher than 4. Here’s a Class V or VI student fiasco, based on using Class III expected meter behavior on high- level work: Auditor finds goal on list that ticks (1/ 8\"). Asks if it’s the correctly worded goal. Gets a tick (1/ 16\"). Runs it on the pc. Pc collapses. Here’s the real way it should have been: Auditor finds goal on list that only ticks. Gets in Suppress and Invalidate on the list. Renulls. Finds another goal. Gets in Suppress on it. Gets a third of a dial instant slash (all goals and items must instant read). Checks it out until he gets a 3\" prior slash on actual GPM. Gets a 2\" slightly latent or prior slash on “correctly worded.” Gives it to the pc and pc thrives. 209 It’s not asking the right question (what it really is) that gives you ticks. In fact a tick with a sharp edge at Class V or VI really means “wrong question asked!” Big reads are the only reads you buy at Class V and VI. Learn the right questions to ask about the character or nature of what you’re examining and you get the big falls, RRs, etc. So it’s a lack of knowledge of track analysis that makes the auditor fall back on small reads. And he’ll fail. The second stage of desperation enters at Class V and VI when the student, hammered"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"by the Instructors, still can’t get big reads (through lack of knowledge of the track and what things can be). The student then abandons all he knew about body motion causing needle reaction. The quickly exhaled breath, the shuffled feet, the can fling about, the stretch, the can bang, all cause big surges. So the auditor encourages the pc to shout goals and items or fling himself about so the meter will react big. This, of course, will spin the pc, getting no charge off, running wrong goals and RIs. By the time the student auditor is trained not to take body motion, shout or breath reads, his track analysis has also improved and he starts to ask the right questions and gets his big reads with the pc quiet as a lamb. I never touch a TA during the pc’s body movement. This loses TA, of course, since a pc is most likely to move when an RI starts to discharge. I never buy a goal unless I’ve seen it instant read, bang on the last letter. I never ask the character of anything to instant read, i. e., “Is this an implant GPM,” because it may go on anticipate or arrive latent. And do I get TA on the pc! In goals finding and plotting you don’t expect much TA. Yet in six consecutive sessions I built TA a few divisions more per session, from 70 TA down divisions to 103 TA down divisions in 21/ 2- hour sessions, and all by never buying a tick, only big RRs or falls. Gradual build of TA shows all is well. So Classes V and VI are not only big read classes, but they are big TA classes as well. As you are handling the basic sources of charge on a case in Classes V and VI, you expect big meter behavior and you get it. Only ignorance of the track keeps the auditor in the small read, small TA departments. If you keep on trying to get what it really is until you have it, you will always see a big read on what it is. You wouldn’t expect to handle high voltage wires with tiny sparks. You would expect huge arcs to crackle. Similarly with the materials of Classes V and VI. If you don’t believe a meter will read big at Classes V and VI, then you haven’t learned yet to find the right things and ask the right questions. And if you settle for ticks or have to make the pc yell items to get big reads you’ll soon have a very messed up case on your hands. So it’s a different meter behavior at the higher classes. Expect it, look for it and make it R E A D! L.

If the pc gives you any goal, for all our sakes, please record it in that session’s auditors report or in his papers if he is not in session. And if the pc thinks of a goal it must be written down and handed over to the auditor to be recorded, with the date noted. Any goal that is offered must become a matter of record so that it can be located by date. Don’t lose the pc’s goals. Attach them to reports and worksheets that are dated. Out of thousands of goals offered you may just glide over the key goal If you have recorded it by date, it can be recovered. If you haven’t, then I don’t know what you’ll do. HOW TO RECOVER A GOAL If a pc develps a bad somatic, the chances are a goal has been invalidated or lost and invalidated. The only way you can get a somatic in R6 is actually to invalidate a GPM (skip it, miss it, fail to pick it up). The invalidation of the GPM causes the somatic. All human suffering basically stems from invalidated GPMs (and they are, of course, all skipped or missed and nobody has picked them up before we came along). Thus, when a pc’s case is going badly and the pc has a nagging somatic, the cause is an invalidated GPM. A GPM, therefore, has been skipped, missed or been refused. This is a sweeping fundamental: Somatics (meaning mostly pain in this case) are caused by Skipped, Refused or Missed GPMs. The exception is the sick stomach. This is always caused by a wrong goal. Somatics, meaning pain or lots of sensation, are caused by skipped, missed or refused GPMs. Sick stomachs (not cold stomach) are caused by wrong goals. Cold stomachs are caused by mis- placed (wrongly plotted) GPMs. A cold body is caused by Implant GPMs or a wildly mis- plotted Actual GPM that may also be an Implant GPM. Thus we see that a skipped, missed or refused GPM is the only one that causes pain or sensation. And we can see that skipping, missing or refusing a GPM all add up to invalidating it. 211 A wrong goal won’t ruin a case. Neither will the inclusion of an implant goal in the plot ruin a case. They only make the pc uncomfortable and will eventuall be found and thrown out. But the missed or refused goal once gone into the discard may have been vital to the case and, now being heavily invalidated, may never come up again. So the GPM invalidated by being missed or refused is the dangerous one. If the pc’s records are in order and legible, if the auditor has recorded all goals mentioned by the pc, the missed or refused GPM can be located. How? This is an actual case: The pc’s goals plot just wouldn’t assemble. The pc was"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"in considerable pain. “A goal has been invalidated” gave a third of a dial surge. The invalidation was dated on the meter. The session reort for that date was looked up. And there recorded was a goal the pc had offered, the auditor had refused (since it wouldn’t read). This goal was checked out and was found to be one of a series of four GPMs that monitored the goals plot. It had never again occured to the pc. It was so invalidated it seemed completely unreal to the pc. It was so unreal that every goal mentioned in that session had to be nulled as a goals list to find it. Only one goal gave the big invalidated surge first noticed. And only after a prepcheck (5 minutes) did it read. As it had already been invalidated by life, it didn’t read when the auditor called it in that session and the auditor had not gotten in supress or invalidate on it. There was the whole case stalled. If the auditor had not recorded it in that session report where it had a date on it, it would have been completely lost. In that session the pc had merely mentioned it as a possible goal, the auditor had said “that didn’t read”. A month later the pc started getting pains. Within four months the pc became very hard to audit. Tjhe lessons here are that one can date an invalidation or supression; and that an auditor must record every goal mentioned by a pc and make it part of the records coupled with a date. That was a close call. So if your pc is running with pain, a goal has beem missed or refused. It will read that “a goal has been invalidated”. The invalidation read can be dated and if recording has been done, the goal can be recovered. These are probably some of the most important Case Repair facts of R6. L.

Sthil Students Sthil Co- audit SCIENTOLOGY VI GOAL CHECK OUTS The hardest thing perhaps for a beginning Class VI Auditor to accept is that he or she must get a proper identification of What The goal is. Experience will eventually make a citizen out of the auditor on this subject. After wrapping a pc around a few telegraph poles with wrong goals and a bad goals plot the auditor, now in shock, realizes the terrible importance of proper Goals Identification, But why wait? There are two reads, both important. Each must be a good fall or RR, 2\" or 3\" long. (1) GOAL READ "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"To be given any attention or Identification drill a goal must read. This can be a l” chug or a fall or RR. But it must read. If the goal has been suppressed or wronged, if it is charged, the “suppress” or “wrong” buttons will produce a l” to 3\" read. (The goal charge transfers to “suppressed” or “invalidated”). Thus either by itself or suppress or invalidate, a goal must read or must have read to be given any identification drill. (2) IDENTIFICATION READ Any goal that has read must now be identified. What is it? This read must be a long fall or RR - a sizable read - not a tick or a 1 / 4 ” flick. This is the IDENTIFICATION READ. To be accepted or discarded, a goal must have (1) A goal read and (2) An Identification read. It is (2) The Identification Read that auditors neglect, don’t believe in, become upset about. And yet lack of it is the only real way to wreak a pc. Of the two the Identification Read is the more important. New pcs grow resistive. They don’t believe the Identification Read is important either. So they protest and sell and gum their meter up. “It’s my goal so why - etc., etc.” So the auditor, nervous about an ARC break, comes off Identification without finding out what the goal is, gives it to the pc AND THEN WONDERS WHY THE PC STARTS GOING TO PIECES. It is not kind, it is very cruel indeed for the auditor to skip Identification. 213 Another way an auditor gets around it is to take reads on what the pc says, not what the auditor asks. BOTH GOAL READ AND IDENTIFICATION READS MUST BE TAKEN ONLY WHEN THE AUDITOR SAYS IT. The read must occur on the auditor’s call, not the pc’s. The read when the pc says it must repeat when the auditor says it or it isn’t true. A new Class VI auditor runs out of questions in Identification. His knowledge of track is not up to really identifying the goal and so the new auditor comes to believe that Identification reads are impossible to get and so stops trying or blames the pc’s metering. It isn’t ever the pc’s metering. It’s lack of auditor knowledge and persistence. The session tape of March 18, 1964 has a lot of Identification Drill on it. In each case the goal was made to read a nice long fall on what it was. The drill is not a pattern, or an assessment list. Here are some questions for Identification: “To Woof. Is that a correctly worded actual goal?” “Does to woof form 18 RIs?” “Is it and Actual GPM?” “Is it an Implant GPM?” “Is it both an Actual and an Implant GPM?” “Is it a lock on an Actual GPM?” “Is it a lock on an Implant GPM?”"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":" “Is it a lock on an Actual RI?” “Is it a lock on an Implant RI?” “Is To Woof no GPM?” “Is it only a goal?” “Is it just an Item on a list?” “Is it an idea you had?” “Does To Woof have a lot of mass connected with it?” “Is it a phrase from an Engram?” The above are the basic questions. An auditor should be able to rip them off in a torrent and vary them. Two long falls is enough to identify. And there is always a long fall available, believe it or not. If it falls well on “correctly worded Actual GPM” that’s it. You go no further. But if it doesn’t, you must find out why it read. ANY GOAL THAT HAS A READ WILL READ HUGELY ON WHAT IT IS IF YOU ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION. To identify a goal puts the pc at ease and completes the cycle of action of the checkout. 214 It should take only two or three minutes. It can get bizarre when standard questions fail. Then knowledge of the pc counts. Knowing the pc had had a life in Punjab, on the 18th March session tape, I asked if “To be untouchable” was “An Indian idea” and got the first long fall after all else had failed to identify. The main reason some auditors will have trouble with Routine 6 will be their disbelief in the necessity to identify a goal well by getting a long read. These auditors will have ARC breaky pcs very soon, will be balked and will be in endless trouble. The severest lesson R6 teaches, no matter what I say, is the necessity to identify goals. You can suppress a goal and ARC break a pc, as you’ll find on the 18th March 1964 tape, by failing to give the pc a right goal. But that’s far far preferable to an apathetic shoveling out of anything that has a goal read. That way lies death. The pc new to R6 gets impatient. He or she only needs to experience the horror of a few wrongly identified goals to become quiet as lambs during the identification step. When Identifying, keep the pc posted. “That didn’t read.” “That ticked.” “That’s a long fall.” And then say to the pc what fell, “To Woof reads as a lock on an"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Implant GPM.” If it’s a correctly worded Actual Goal get it in the bring about steps (and oppose if any) and get a fall on the number and then give it to the pc. “Is that your goal?” “That’s your goal.” _______________ Failure to learn the knack of Identifying goals debars the R6 auditor from any success. Failure to accurately Identify goals that get read sets the pc up for catastrophe. R6 moves smoothly only when goals found are properly identified by a big read. L.

An auditor is in absolute control of the bank- it always does what you tell it to do. A case must not be run without TA action or with minimal TA action. If it didn’t occur, tone arm action has to have been prevented! It doesn’t just “not occur.” The skill of an auditor is directly measured by the amount of TA he or she can get. Pcs are not more difficult one than another. Any pc can be made to produce TA. But some auditors cut TA more than others. The most vital necessity of auditing at any level of Scientology is to get tone arm action. Not to worry the pc about it but just to get TA action. Not to find something that will get future TA. But just to get TA NOW. Many auditors are still measuring their successes by things found or accomplished in the session. Though this is important too (mainly at Level IV), it is secondary to tone arm action. 1. Get good tone arm action. 2. Get things done in the session to increase tone arm action. And body motion doesn’t count, as TA. Without tone arm motion no charge is being released and no actual case betterment is observed beyond a few somatics removed. The pc’s session goals stay the same. The pc’s life doesn’t change. THE MOST CORRECT TRACK SIGNIFICANCES RUN BUT WITHOUT TA ACTION WILL NOT CHANGE BUT CAN DETERIORATE A CASE. It takes the right process correctly run to get TA action. So don’t underrate processes or the action of the auditor. TA MOVING SIGNALS AUDITOR NOT TO ACT. TA NOT MOVING SIGNALS AUDITOR TO ACT."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":" Your enemy is overrestimulation of the pc. As soon as the pc goes into more charge than he or she can itsa easily the TA slows down! And as soon as the pc drowns in the overrestimulation the TA stops clank! Unless destimulated a case can’t get a rocket read or present the auditor with a valid goal. In doing R6 the silent auditor lets the pc itsa all over the whole track and causes overrestimulation which locks up the TA. But in lower levels of auditing, inviting an itsa with silence is an ordinary action. 216 As soon as you get into Level VI auditing however, on the pc’s actual GPMs, the auditor has to be crisp and busy to get TA and a silent, idle auditor can mess up the pc and get very little TA. Level VI auditing finds the auditor smoothly letting the pc itsa RIs and lists but the auditor going at it like a small steam engine finding RIs, RIs, RIs, goals, RIs, RIs, RIs. For the total TA in an R6 session only is proportional to the number of RIs found without goofs, wrong goals or other errors which rob TA action. So the higher the level the more control of the pc’s attention. Only in R6 where you’re dead on the pc’s GPMs and the pc is allowed to say it is or isn’t can you get good TA action out of listing and nulling. And even then a failure to let the pc say it is it can cut the TA down enormously. In confirmation of auditors being too anxious to get in the itsa line themselves and not let the pc is the fad of using the meter as a Ouija board. The auditor asks it questions continually and never asks the pc. Up the spout go divisions of TA. “Is this item a terminal?” the auditor asks the meter. Why not ask the pc? If you ask the pc, you get an itsa, “No, I think it’s an oppterm because______” and the TA moves. AUDITOR FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND If a pc says something and the auditor fails to understand what the pc said or meant, the correct response is: “I did not (hear you) (understand what was said) (get that last).” To do anything else is not only bad form, it can amount to a heavy ARC break. INVALIDATION To say “You did not speak loud enough . . .” or any other use of “you” is an invalidation. The pc is also thrown out of session by having responsibility hung on him or her. The auditor is responsible for the session. Therefore the auditor has to assume responsibility for all comm breakdowns in it. EVALUATION Far more serious than invalidation above, is the accidental evaluation which may occur when the auditor repeats what the pc said. NEVER repeat anything a pc says after him, no matter why. Repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel you’re a circuit. But that isn’t the main"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc. If you say it wrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest. The pc must correct the wrongness and hangs up right there. It may take an hour to dig the pc out of it. 217 DIRTY NEEDLES If your pc has a dirty needle, its cause is CUT ITSA or an L1 session ARC break. NO other source such as a wrong item or goal or earlier engrams or service fac bypassed charge can cause a dirty needle. If it’s a dirty needle its cause lies in basic auditing not in technique errors. This rule is invariable. The apparent exception is the session ARC break that keys in bypassed technique charge. All dirty needles are caused by the auditor failing to hear all the pc had to say in answering a question or volunteering data. Charge is removed from a case only by the comm cycle pc to auditor. The auditor’s command restimulates a charge in the pc. The only way this charge can be blown is by the pc telling the auditor. CLEANING CLEANS The auditor who cleans a clean meter is asking for trouble. This is the same as asking a pc for something that isn’t there and develops a “withhold of nothing.” ECHO METERING The pc says, “You missed a suppress. It’s “ and the auditor reconsults the meter asking for a Suppress. That leaves the pc’s offering an undischarged charge. NEVER ASK THE METER AFTER A PC VOLUNTEERS A BUTTON. Example: You’ve declared Suppress clean, pc gives you another Suppress. Take it and don’t ask Suppress again. That’s echo metering. If a pc puts his own ruds in, don’t at once jump to the meter to put his ruds in. That makes all his offerings missed charge. Echo metering is miserable auditing. DON’T ECHO INVALIDATE Echo invalidation: The pc gives an item. The auditor calls it back to the pc and says it doesn’t RR. If this is kept up the pc will be put into a state of sensation that is appalling. The right way to do this is as follows: Pc gives item. 218 Auditor writes it down. All items are written down that the pc gives. An auditor never repeats items to the pc after the pc says them. If the auditor doesn’t understand he asks pc to spell it or if it is singular or plural. Don’t fake an understanding. The list must be"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"accurate. Echo invalidation, in which pc names an item and auditor says “That isn’t it” is not just bad form but a very vicious practice that leads to a games condition. The invalidation of each item makes the pc very dizzy and very desperate. The pc, sick and confused, starts plunging in desperation for the right item and goes swiftly down tone and out of session. High pc morale is vital to blowing charge and finding RIs. Uphold the pc’s morale. Don’t begin echo invalidation. METER INVALIDATION An auditor who just sits and shakes his head, “Didn’t rocket read” can give a pc too many loses and deteriorate the pc’s ability to run GPMs. In a conflict between pc and meter, take the pc’s data. Why? Because Protest and Assert and Mistake will also read on a meter. You can get these off, but why create them? Your data comes from the pc and the meter always for anything. And if the pc’s data is invalidated you won’t get a meter’s data. If the pc says he has a PTP and the meter says he doesn’t, you take the pc’s data that he does. You take the pc’s data. Never take his orders. Also, minimize a pc’s dependency on a meter. Don’t keep confirming a pc’s data by meter read with, “That reads. Yes, that’s there. Yes, there’s a rocket read....” The meter is not there to invalidate the pc. The E- Meter registers charge. A very high or low tone arm, a sticky or dirty needle all are registrations of this charge. The “chronic meter of a case” is an index of chronic charge. The fluctuations of a meter during a session are registering relative charge in different portions of the pc’s time track. More valuably the meter registers released charge. You can see it blowing on the meter. The disintegrating RR, the blowing down of the TA, the heavy falls, the loosening needle all show charge being released. The meter registers charge found and then charge released. It registers charge found but not yet released by the needle getting tight, by DN, by a climbing TA or TA going far below the Clear read. Then as this cleans up, the charge is seen to “blow.” Charge that is restimulated but not released causes the case to “charge up,” in that charge already on the time track is triggered but is not yet viewed by the pc. The whole cycle of restimulated charge that is then blown gives us the action of auditing. When prior charge is restimulated but not located so that it can be blown, we get “ARC breaks.” Auditing selectively restimulates, locates the charge and discharges it (as seen on the action of a moving tone arm). 219 The meter in actual fact does nothing but locate charged areas below the awareness of the pc and verify that the charge has been removed. The meter cures nothing and does not treat. It only assists the auditor in assisting the preclear to look and verify having looked. "},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"METER DEPENDENCE A pc can be made more dependent upon the meter or can be made more independent of the meter, all in the way a meter is used by the auditor. Meter dependence is created by invalidation by or poor acknowledgement of the auditor. If the auditor seems not to accept the pc’s data, then the pc may insist that the auditor “see it read on the meter.” This can grow up into a formidable meter dependence on the part of the pc. A pc must be carefully weaned of meter dependence, not abruptly chopped off. If a pc’s case is improving the pc becomes more independent of the meter. This is the proper direction. Build up the pc’s confidence in his own knowingness and continuously and progressively reduce the pc’s dependence on a meter. As the pc gets along in running time track and GPMs with their goals and reliable items he or she often becomes better than the meter as to what is right or wrong, what is the goal, what RI still reads. CHARGE Charge, the stored quantities of energy in the time track, is the sole thing that is being relieved or removed by the auditor from the time track. When this charge is present in huge amounts the time track overwhelms the pc and the pc is thrust below observation of the actual track. The mechanism of permanent restimulation consists of opposing forces of comparable magnitude which cause a balance which does not respond to current time and remains “timeless.” Such phenomena as the overt act- motivator sequence, the problem (postulate- counterpostulate), tend to hold certain portions of the time track in “permanent creation” and cause them to continue to exist in present time as unresolved masses, energies, spaces, times and significances. The intention of the physical universe (and those who have become degraded enough to further only its ends) is to make a thetan solid, immobile and decisionless. The fight of the thetan is to remain unsolid, mobile or immobile at will, and capable of decision. This in itself is the principal unresolved problem and it itself creates timeless mass which accomplishes the basic purpose of a trap. BYPASSED CHARGE 220 Bypassed charge does not always = ARC break. But ARC break always = bypassed charge. Bypassed charge always exists in a session- it isn’t until it is keyed in by some communication failure in session that it causes an ARC break. "},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The source of all ARC breaks is bypassed charge. There is no other source of ARC breaks. People do not ARC break on known charge. It is always the hidden or the earlier charge that causes the ARC break. The pc never knows why the ARC break. He may think he does and disclaim about it. But the moment the actual reason is spotted (the real missed area) the ARC break ceases. All bypassed charge is in some degree a missed withhold, missed by both auditor and pc. In a session or handling the living lightning we handle, people can be hit by a forceful charge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them. Their affinity, reality and communication (life force) is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with what we call an ARC break or have an ARC broken aspect. Everything on the whole Know to Mystery Scale that still lies above the pc finds the pc at effect. These are all on automatic. Therefore the pc in an ARC break is in the grip of the reaction which was in the incident, now fully on automatic. The pc’s anger in the incident is not even seen or felt by the pc. But the moment something slips the pc is in the grip of that emotion as an automaticity and becomes furious or apathetic or whatever toward the auditor. As soon as the actual bypassed charge is found and recognized as the charge by the person, up goes affinity and reality and communication and life can be lived. THE ARC BREAK THE CYCLE OF THE ARC BREAK STAGE ONE: The ARC break starts always in the same way. The pc finds something wrong with the auditor, the subject, or tools of auditing or the auditing room. He does this in varying intensity, ARC break to ARC break. STAGE TWO: This is followed by misemotion, also directed at the auditor, subject, tools or room. STAGE THREE: If the auditor continues on with auditing the pc will drop into grief, sadness or apathy. This is an inevitable cycle and may be followed by the pc with greater or lesser intensity of emotion or loudness or lack of response. 221 IN R6 WHEN THE PC CRITICIZES OR ATTACKS THE AUDITOR OR GOES INTO GRIEF OR APATHY, AN R6 ERROR HAS JUST OCCURRED. THE AUDITOR MUST IGNORE THE PC ‘ S STATEMENTS AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE ARC BREAK AND QUICKLY REMEDY THE R6 AND DO NOTHING ELSE. THE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF ALL R6 ARC BREAKS CONSISTS OF A MISSED OR WRONGLY DESIGNATED GPM, GOAL OR RELIABLE ITEM. THERE ARE NO OTHER SOURCES OF R6 ARC BREAKS."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":" Bad sessioning, poor auditing, ordinary life missed withholds are only contributive to R6 ARC breaks and are incapable of doing more than keying in and intensifying the magnitude of the ARC break which has already been caused by errors in R6. ARC BREAK RULE 1: IF THE PC ARC BREAKS, ISSUE NO FURTHER AUDITING COMMANDS UNTIL BOTH PC AND AUDITOR ARE SATISFIED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE ARC BREAK HAS BEEN LOCATED AND INDICATED. Do not issue more orders, do not run a process, do not offer to run a process, do not sit idly letting the pc ARC break. Follow this rule: ARC BREAK RULE 2: WHEN A PC ARC BREAKS OR CAN’T GO ON FOR ANY REASON, DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT AND LOCATE AND INDICATE TO THE PC THE BYPASSED CHARGE. If you know you’ve missed a goal or RI, just saying so prevents any ARC break. DON’T BYPASS CHARGE UNKNOWN TO THE PC. ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT The meter is invaluable in locating bypassed charge and curing an ARC break. The trick is TO FIND AND INDICATE the RIGHT bypassed charge to the pc and to handle it when possible but never fail to indicate it. It is then up to the auditor to locate it more precisely as to character and time and indicate it to the pc. The pc will feel better the moment the right type of bypassed charge is identified by assessment and indicated by the auditor. If the pc does not feel better but further ARC breaks then the assessment is either incomplete or incorrect. If the pc blows up in your face on being given a type of charge, keep going, as you have not yet found the charge. You can, however, undo a session ARC break assessment by continuing beyond the pc’s cognition of what it is. Continuing an assessment after the pc has cognited, invalidates the pc’s cognition and cuts the itsa line and may cause a new ARC break. Several bypassed charges can exist and be found on one list. Sometimes in trying to locate the bypassed charge causing an ARC break, the pc’s needle is so dirty that it almost can’t be read. However there is a way to read it. When the correct bypassed charge is located and indicated the needle will go beautifully clean. But it can be done without a meter, just by letting the pc think over each line read to him or her from the ARC Break Assessment and say whether it is or isn’t and if it is, spotting the thing bypassed. 222 Don’t ever be “reasonable” about an ARC break and think the pc is perfectly right to be having one “because____.” If that ARC break exists, the pc doesn’t know what’s causing it and neither do you until you and the pc find it! If you and the pc knew what was causing it, there would be no further ARC break. ARC breaks are inevitable. They will happen. Q AND A ARC BREAKS Q and A causes ARC"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"breaks by BYPASSING CHARGE. How? The pc says something. The auditor does not understand or acknowledge. Therefore the pc ‘ s utterance becomes a bypassed charge generated by whatever he or she is trying to release. As the auditor ignores it and the pc reasserts it, the original utterance’s charge is built up and up. Finally the pc will start issuing orders in a frantic effort to get rid of the missed charge. This is the source of pc orders to the auditor. Understand and acknowledge the pc. Take the pc’s data. Don’t pester the pc for more data when the pc is offering data. Learn to see if the pc has said everything he or she wants to say before the next auditor action, never do a new auditor action while or if the pc wants to speak and you’ll get superior TA action. Cut the pc off, get in more actions than the pc is allowed to answer and you’ll have a dirty needle, then a stuck TA and then an ARC break. Realize that the answering of the process question is senior to the asking of another process question. Watch the pc’s eyes. Don’t take auditing actions if the pc is not looking at you. Don’t give acknowledgements that aren’t needed. Overacknowledgement means acknowledging before the pc has said all. PC TONE The pc rises in tone up to the lower levels of the tone scale. He or she comes up to degradation, up to apathy. And it often feels horrible and, unlike an ARC break and the sad effect, is not cured except by more of the same processing. Then suddenly they realize that they have come up to being able to feel bad. They even come up to feeling pain. And all that is a gain. L.

The list may also be used where the pc is not ARC broken but experiencing bad indicators or good indicators are out. But in this case it is as in Auditing by List and each line is cleaned in the meter in it’s turn. This is an auditing use. ARC Break assessment is not auditing and is rapidly done to remove the by- passed charge causing the ARC Break without paying further attention to auditing aspects. Be careful in using this assessment on ARC Breaks to cease to assess when the charge has been found and indicated to the pc and relief is experienced. In Auditing by List use, all the charge is picked up line by line. But not in assessing for ARC Breaks. There the major charge is found fast and indicated. In indicating charge to a pc just repeat the charge named in the question, not the charge announced by the pc. Exception is a cheerful cognition by the pc that also reads on the meter. Then one repeats the bare bone charge announced. PC: I realise the by- passed charge is being scolded by my pc yesterday. Auditor: (Correct) The by- passed charge here is a drop in ARC with your pc. INCORRECT: Auditor: The by- passed charge is being scolded by your pc. Why is that incorrect? Because it insinuates the pc has been wronged and puts him at effect. Pcs must be made causative. Example: List question: Has something been wrongly worded? (reads) Auditor: What could have been wrongly worded? PC: Oh! It’s that last Item. You gave me the wrong one! Auditor: (Correct) An Item has been wrongly worded. (Incorrect) I gave you a wrong Item. If you used the second version, the pc would be made to seem wronged. Always find out what the specific trouble was when the question indicates a generality. “A GPM has been missd” is all right as an indication to the pc. Indicate it and all is smooth. But as a technical necessity before you can really go on, you must now find what GPM has been missed. It may be more than one. It might have been the one just above. It might have been careless admin between sessions. And it might have been years ago on a P. E. course! If you just bull onward without knowing the score, you’ll shortly have a new ARC Break to handle. Just indicating it can cure the ARC Break. But it doesn’t cure whatever stupidity is happening on the track. Be thorough. Be quick. Be honest. And, using this list on R6 By Passed Charge will minimise ARC Breaks.

Auditing comm cycle is bad. (2) Auditors metering is poor in that reads occur which are not noted. Example: Pc mentions item twice in a cognition, it reads both times, auditor fails to note it, then pounds it to make it read after it has gone. (3) Sloppy Admin: Auditor loses his place or doesn’t note and control when pc does. Auditor doesn’t keep separate accurate record of exact progress on worksheet. (4) Just not getting on with the job, doing all sorts of actions other than R6, stopping nervously at every flicker of an eyelash to do ARC Break Assessments or thrash about looking for imaginary faults. (5) Pc flinch. Items won’t read because pc scared green. Cure is to investigate “flinch”. (6) Challenging R6 alignment, forms, materials or benefits, a form of flinch. This is the source of more sickness or pains or bad needles than any other single fault."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"It shows up as a tick- tocky needle (a small RS which turns on), called a TOCKY NEEDLE. (7) Not letting the pc have items or progress, which is a bigger and worse form of ARC Break than leaving a little charge. (8) Not recognizing a PASSED CHARGE NEEDLE. You don’t have to do an ARC Break Assessment for charge left on items already “run” if you recognize the queer chuggy reluctance of the needle to read. When you see that, you just scout for where, rapidly, get the charged Item or Bring About step, release it quickly and go on. Needle on real Items reads smooth, contrary to earlier goal data. If charge is left closer to p. t. than where you are, where you are Items won’t read well. (9) Beating Items to pieces with excess steps. You do minimal steps. The vital ones are, “Next oppterm (or Terminal) please.” Pc says it. Auditor says it. It reads both times. Auditor says “That’s you Item”, circles it on work sheet. “What is its relation to this GPM?” “Give me the Bring About steps”. Auditor makes appropriate notes. “Next terminal please”. (10) Not getting in all the Bring About steps. These are 3 in number. Example (a) 3rd opp to second terminal (b) 3rd terminal to second opp (c) 3rd opp to 3rd terminal. They are done only in this order. There are no “Brought About” steps. 228 (11) Not using enough “suppress” or “challenged”. “Has this BA been suppressed?” “Has this Item FORM been previously knocked about?” “Has this sequence been questioned?” It’s done rapidly, not flattened. Some times the suppress read only is taken, then the item or step is asked again (pc doesn’t even answer the suppress question). Meanwhile one is alert for a tocky needle and if it turns into one, one just goes on. (12) Taking care of “trouble” before it happens. One always lets trouble catch up and manifest plainly before taking care of it. (13) Not understanding the only times you go into patch up or non- running actions. These are (a) no reads or bad reads. (b) no heat whatever. (c) ARC Break. (Heat does not always have to be present but it must not be continually absent). (14) Not coming off patch up the moment a tocky needle turns on. (15) The pc suppressed into the anti- social or reprehensible character of the goal. This is now essentially a very simple car to drive. You were trained to run a more complex vehicle. The very fact that it is so simple require you to be trained so hard. For you have to be honest, expert and fast. R6 itself will straighten out any physical or mental problem if you just get on with it. There are on senior remedies. No other process will surpass it or remedy what it does except it. No other process or approach will straighten things up like it will. PROVIDING it’s run. R6 is quantitative. It’s the number of RIs run, the number of GPMs run. Quantity! It may be ten GPMs down the line before the pc wakes up in the morning without a"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"single ache, pain or worry. And even then that will last maybe ten minutes only. A whole series and the feeling lasts half the day. The ground covered is proportional to the gain attained. Not even cognition’s are important. They sometime even restrain a read. A pc’s worry about not grasping how it BAs can hold it up. But the pc’s ignoring the sense doesn’t. It’s just significance and mass run, quantity of. How many Items. How many GPMs. That determines gain. What GPMs are run determines very little. It’s all just a problem in TA after all. But this TA comes from the release and vanishment of the imprisoner of all beings, the reactive mind itself. So get on with it. Note: The easiest way to run a team of GPMs is “2 for 2”. The auditor runs one GPM on the pc that has already been run on the auditor and then immediately one on the pc that has not been run on the auditor. The team only then reverses and the team member now auditing audits one that has been run on him (or her) and one that has not. This equalizes the strain, keep the team at parity and is only fair. A certain amount of charge comes off the auditors bank as he (or she) audits it on another, on the other hand it may get suppressed. So use a lot of “suppressed as an auditor” to get the bank clean. When you get very far along there’s yet another way to do this if you’re brave. So all is not lost. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: dr Copyright © 1964 by L.

(3) ARC breaking the pc by overwhelm. (4) Worrying and harassing the pc about the meter. (5) Knocking off running GPMs and getting in endless session considerations and BMSs. (6) Downgrading the pc’s auditing level and starting in on problems and lower level processes. (7) Deciding that he or she has been taught wrongly and trying to develop some new way. (8) Listing for other types of goals. (9) Just giving up. Now this picture I’m painting here is not the rule but the exception. It doesn’t happen to everybody but when it does, the above may be the response. There are two types of pcs. Pc Type A can run through anything and get reads, heat and TA. Pc Type B will shut off when he or she hits a misplaced comma. These two types are not different people. They are different conditions of physical bone. They have nothing to do with body age. They may have alot to do with tiredness. The pc who works hard all day will not read well on arrival in the auditing session. After about two hours alot of pcs just have their meter pack up. 230 If you were to audit a Type A for 8 hours, say until 2am, you would suddenly have a Type B pc. Therefore the pc who doesn’t get enough food or sleep or is just exhausted in life is a Type B pc. For this is chronic with this pc, being built into his or her living habits. A Type B pc made to go early to bed and get 8 or 9 hours sleep, made to eat breakfast and lunch and supper may become in a few days a Type B pc. But as we can’t always guarantee this rest and food regimen, and because general physical tone in life may require several months, to remedy by improving livingness alone, we are left with a Type B pc. One can and should, as and auditor, try to make this Type B pc into a Type A by livingness discipline. But one always count on doing so. A Type A pc will also pack up a meter, some sooner than others. If you were doing night auditing you would find that a Type A pc, wonderful easy meter responses would be subject to a pack up at some small hour of the morning. Some would suddenly go dead on the meter at 2am, some at 3am, some at 6am. This if observed over a time would demonstrate similar hours for the pack up. The Type A pc, who could be shoved through almost anything, would standardly become a Type B at a certain hour of the night. The Type B pc has packed up already. Lack of sleep, lack of food, nervous strain, general physical weariness have caught up with Type B so that its always “2am” the"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"moment of “life’s lowest ebb”, even at 12 noon. Age, even illness, are actually outside this weariness factor. Now, if you will go back and read your Auditors Code - any Auditors Code back to 1951, I think, you will find this covered. At Level Six the matter becomes staggeringly important. You could go on auditing at Level VI or below for years without having the roof fall in. You would just say it was just the pc or process used and that some pc didn’t get TA and some did and try to argue it away. But when you get to Level VI you are looking the tiger straight in the eye. The Moment of Truth arrives. Items don’t read, TA doesn’t blow down. And items are obviously right there to do so. So what’s wrong? If an auditor doesn’t know, snap, what’s wrong he or she may follow the “remedies” I’ve listed above as High Crimes. A Type B pc is already so exhausted that no by passed charge of any kind can be tolerated. So to audit without reads, without heat, without blowdowns is far more serious than it would be on a Type A pc (on whom it would also be a High Crime). So you see, first things first, you’re right back to the Auditor’s Code (of all things!) but now its a “run or won; t run” Code. Follow it and the pc runs, break it and you’ve had it. Total Yes or Total No. BY PASSED CHARGE 231 Now aside from the Type of pc, you should learn by experience that this is the rule that applies. ITEMS WON’T READ WHEN YOU’VE GONE BEYOND AN UNRUN CHARGE. Conversely: When Items won’t read you have a charged area behind you. Honest it’s just that simple. Items are reading well, heat on. Good, no charged area behind you. Items chugging, small, reading badly or not at all, charge exists closer to the top of the bank than where you are. You might as well learn this. It isn’t going to change. It will save you from committing the High Crimes above and failing utterly with your pc. THE PC WHO DOESN’T RUN AT ALL Where the pc doesn’t read at all chronically, just never reads, Type B extreme, the charge is Life. Exhaustion, O/ Ws, no sleep keys in too much bank. Sleep, rest, O/ Ws, Level IV and below auditing will set this right. But your pc (who has already arrived at Level VI) should have has enough lower level auditing. If however the pc’s lower level auditing was never effective then you have quite a problem. The answer is not to go off R6 but to make this pc rest and eat. If R6 still won’t run, go into defining O/ Ws and why auditing won’t work. O/ Ws will loosen up a bank. It’s superior processing. But if your pc got to Level 6 without effective earlier auditing, rest and food and keeping on trying to get the beginning few items discharged are your best answers and until that’s given a very fine try one shouldn’t revert to lower level auditing. TYPE B PCs Now then, how about the pc who ran two GPMs and the meter packed up. That may be"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"rest and food in combination with the following but otherwise it is only the following: Charge has been missed. That’s all. That’s the only reason (weariness and hunger excepted) you suddenly fail to get reads, TA blowdowns and heat. Yesteryear it could have been an improperly worded GPM or a lot of things. But you don’t have wrongly worded GPMs now unless you really goof in copying or go crazy enough to try to run one you or the pc found. What could the charge be, then? A GPM out of sequence, a missed GPM (or more), a GPM in an incorrect series. How could you have such? Well, easy. Life scrambles the bank for one thing, so the perfect series is pretty hard to plot. Earlier Co- audit experience dealt with a lot of sequence errors. You might lose your place on the plot. The pc comes into session and starts a whole 232 GPM (or 2 items) lower than you left off and you don; t notice it until there you are looking at a packed up meter. It ceases to work. To go on is criminal. Why? Because that’s the only way you can damage anything. Running a GPM out of sequence isn’t serious so long as it’s in the same series. It’s just unfortunate and takes a bit more time through corrections and patching. It mainly slows down the rate of running by consuming just that much auditing time. But running a GPM without needle action on Items or TA is criminal. It means one hasn’t learned that this indicates only one thing, charge left behind. You can run a GPM out of sequence unless it stops reading. When it quits reading, quit. Don’t go one item further. To remedy this, find what’s out of sequence, find what has been missed, find where the charge got left. Correct that and then run the bank correctly. If the meter behaved well on GPM 4 and on “5” packed up, there’s charge between where it ran well and where it packed up. Find it, correct it and go on with the correct progression. You know, it’s even sort of silly having to stress all this so hard. If you were out driving and were able to do 60 on a road and then couldn’t do but 5 mph, you’d certainly realize that something was wrong with the road. Well, in view of the fact that you can always go 60 on the GPM sequences providing you don’t leave the road or miss a section, it would seem pretty obvious that were you not doing 60 you’ve left the road or aren’t going. All the road, like any good road can be traveled easily, as long as you are on it. Of course you may think this GPM road is full of holes or is peculiar or erratic or isn’t built right. That’s an amateur blunder. It’s awfully like those near perfect Roman straight- as- a- die roads. Only the way you travel over it or the errors in traveling it (like thinking you’re in Lewes fording the river which you’ve not left"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Newhaven) or just not traveling it because you cease to travel it. When your meter packs up you’re not traveling the section you think you are. You’re still in Lewes fording the river which you didn’t ford. You’re not ten miles further on even though you’re busy reading Items that are ten miles further on. Because you say “we’re ten miles from Lewes” doesn’t guarantee you are if your meter hasn’t read well or at all since Lewes. You’ll wake up finally to the fact you never crossed the river at Lewes and haven’t any road under you. So the meter won’t read. TYPE A PCs Type A pcs are not necessarily easier to audit. Errors are harder to detect. But also errors do less damage. But they still make upsets. 233 A Type A pc stuck somewhat in the ford at Lewes will read somewhat and with heat on being ten miles from Lewes and will even make good case gains. On a Type A pc you only accept pure text book and realize you’ve left charged areas when you haven’t got perfect reads, BDs and heat. Learn to ask where the pc is and click it off. You’ll find the pc in the Item the pc is in. Ask for it by numbers. Arc you two GPMs back? Fall. In the first pair from the top, second pair, third pair F. Rerun the 2nd and 3rd pair with full steps. If a pc is still stuck in a GPM you think has been departed from and yet a goal has been skipped, the pc will be found in the bottom oppterm of the last GPM in correct sequence or the second pair from the bottom. Learn to locate your pc by numbers and GPMs. You’d look pretty silly out driving if you left your car stuck in the ford at Lewes and told everyone you were in London miles away. They’d think you were batty. Well it’s just as batty to leave a pc stuck in GPM 4, run out of reads in the next GPM, and try to go on anyway. GPMs are a game of Parcheesi, only easier. It looks pretty amateur to tell the players you’ve gone around the corner when your piece is still sitting squares back of where you claim you are. That’s all a meter says when it packs up (except for the weariness factor and is says there too) “You ain’t where you think you are brother”. What kind of think does it take to thereafter go groping forward! The pc can only be stuck where you have already been. Of course none of this will make sense to somebody who hasn’t done well on the Clay Table and doesn’t realize that GPMs are a study in actual travel in distance. The concept of things arranged in space in sequence has to have been grasped before one can grasp going forward or back. One has to realize that GPMs are laid out like a road; one is actually going along a road. This possibly gets qualified by some as “what is meant here is that the symbology is road- like and this is a metaphor.” No. No. No! GPMs are arranged in spatial sequence and you move the pc along this sequence and when you don’t get reads you’ve left the pc back there somewhere stuck. And I do mean back there. No metaphor. The pc isn’t with you. You’re not accompanied. So the needle acts badly, the heat goes off and there’s no gain, ARC"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"breaks and everything goes to bits before your eyes. It’s no crime to have things go to bits. It’s only a crime not to know they have and act accordingly, find the pc, find the road and walk it correctly. Honest, I wish I could tell you very plainly so there couldn’t be any misunderstanding. IT’S NOT EVEN A PROBLEM. When your meter doesn’t respond you haven’t arrived there, when it responds badly you aren’t completely there, when it doesn’t respond at all there’s nobody there. The only place a road simile differs is that a road stays there, when traveled on and is still behind you. The GPMs traveled through properly vanish. 234 So again if there’s road behind you in running, GPMs you haven’t traveled it . For in traveling through GPMs you shouldn’t have any road left. A being isn’t free who has to walk only one road. We have learned now to walk this road so that it disappears and ceased to be the same old agonized rut. But it is a road and running GPMs presents the same problem as any road. If you haven’t walked down it you aren’t going down it. If you haven’t walked you are at the place where you stopped walking. If the road vanished behind you and you went back to walk it, it wouldn’t be there to walk upon. And meter reactions are the sign of walking. Meter reacting - you’re walking. Meter not reacting - you’re not walking. Meter reacting badly - you’re stumbling ahead slowly being pulled on by rubber bands to the point where you got stuck in the mud. Rubber bands stretch only so far. Then you’re not walking at all. Anyone would learn these things fast enough if he were being taught Parcheesi. But then there’s no awe mixed up in Parcheesi because it was so much like Kabala that had Rudderguds all over its Spoofers in Upper Anastabulla. One would simply learn to move the piece on the board, square by square from beginning to end. And I don’t think one would get any weird notions of how the piece was in square 2 when it obviously was sitting in square 1. If you have trouble running R6, don’t send for New METHODS or a Chart to Dumbala to bail you out. Just realize that when your meter misbehaves you’ve left road behind you. Don’t go on. Find it, blow it and walk the correct road. Even a Type B pc is only a case of too tired to travel. When you lay out those GPMs on the clay table and move the white ball PLEASE realize that’s no metaphor you’re performing. That’s a road and it goes across distance and it begins and ends. And thank the holies we have a way to travel it. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: jw Copyright © 1964 by L.

(2) Try to find an end word to account for it (usually pc says it in describing the worry, or at least says a lock). (3) Try by very brief list to locate the actual end word.

Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 238 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF OCTOBER 22, 1964 Sthil Students WHAT AN R6 AUDITOR SHOULD KNOW A number of students have fluncked their provisional examinations lately for the following reasons: 1) They did not know what to do when an Item does not immediately read. If the Item doesn’t read, list for the Item by using the correct Listing question. If the Item still does not read, here are some of the questions an auditor could ask: “Has this Item been suppressed?” “Has this Item been not- ised?” “What considerations do you have about this Item?” If the Item still doesn’t read the auditor could briefly check whether the pc is dramatizing the Item, whether the pc has had the correct concept of the Item or not, whether heat has been suppressed. 2) They did not know the correct Listing questions. These are: a) “What would Oppterm bring about?” (when looking for the terminal of the same pair) "},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"b) “What Item would have brought about Terminal?” (when looking for the Oppterm of the next pair down) Therefore, even though we have the complete line plot, it is sometimes necessary to list for the next Item. This immediately helps the pc to locate the Item in its position in the GPM or the pc gets rid of a few locks and the Item blows down like a dream. 3) They did not know what to do when you run into trouble on R6. Question: What does R6 “trouble” consist of? Answer: R6 “trouble” basically consists of a) Reads shut off. b) Pc refuses to continue on R6. c) Heat turns off. Question: Why do ‘reads shut off’? Answer Because you are running the pc without a goal under him. 239 Question: So what dod you do when you run into trouble on R6? Answer: 1) YOU FIND OUT WHERE THE PC IS SITTING. 2) Find the relationship of the material you are dealing with. Question: Where would the pc be? Answer: The pc is still ‘safely” sitting ‘way back’ in the last correct action. Question: Is it OK you you to continue running the pc down the line plot after your reads have shut off ‘in the hope of reads turning on again if you go on long enough? ’ Answer: NO!! DON’T GO BEYOND A NON- READING METER. (HCO B 12 June 64; page 3:- “Running a GPM out of sequence isn’t serious so long as it’s in the same series..... etc. BUT RUNNING A GPM WITHOUT NEEDLE ACTION ON ITEMS OR TA IS CRIMINAL”) Question: What should an auditor do when an Item has not read, but the pc insists it has blown? Answer: Check whether the Iten “Has Blown” “Not Blown”. If it reads that it has blown, ask the pc to give you the next Item, but if the next Item does not read, DON” T GO ANY FURTHER. You’ve got R6 ‘Trouble’ on your hands and what do you do when you’re in trouble? You find out where your pc is, etc. Question: What about a Tocky Needle turning on? Answer: If it really is a Tocky Needle, you are cleaning a clean, but the following has been observed:- Auditor running a GPM with reads getting smaller and smaller: “Okay, let me just check for bypassed charge. In this GPM have we bypassed any"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"charge?” Instant Dirty Read. Auditor: “Oh- oh, Tocky Needle. Well, I won’t argue with that. Next Oppterm please!” By the way, just in case of confusion, the above is an example of how NOT to run R6! Here is another ‘Please don’t follow’ example: Auditor: “Has the Item blown? (no read) Not Blown? (read) Blown? (no read) Not blown? (read) Blown? (no read) Not blown (read) Blown? (protest read) That reads. The Iten has blown. Next Oppterm please!” L.

RON HUBBARD ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Founder 244 From THE INNER STRUCTURE OF THE MIND by L. Ron Hubbard GRADE VI CONFIDENTIAL We are going to delineate for you the inner structure of the reactive mind. The core of the reactive mind is the R6 bank. It is surrounded by engrams and secondaries which must be wiped out to get at the core itself. And what does the R6 bank consist of? You may be surprised to learn it is groups of words called GPMs- Goals- ProblemsMass which serve to confuse a Being. They are the cause of aberration. The contents of the R6 bank are aberrated stable data. In the demo each container- like object is a GPM, and the balls of clay on top represent its verbal contents. (Note: The author refers here to a demo set up by LRH in a film to demonstrate the reactive mind. The demo model was of a “what looked like a string of barges, each loaded with about a dozen clay balls packed tightly against each other forming two rows.”) These phrases are based on the electro- magnetic principle of plus and minus charge. On one side of a GPM are the positive phrases, on the other the negative, and these go together to form pairs. More on that later. Here you see an amazing phenomenon. The reactive mind is not a chaotic patchwork jumble of words and emotions, but rather an exact order of verbal phrases, the same in every person. Like the Time Track, the precision with which the reactive mind was put together is staggering. Don’t think it was easy to find all this out. We had to get the precise numbers of GPMs, and- oh yes- the number of RIs, or Reliable Items, the various phrases of a GPM. The RIs long remained a secret. Likewise the fact that the GPMs contain Mass and Significance, and that the bank has Mass and Weight. The end of the series of GPMs runs into the beginning at a place called present time. Incidentally, there are only two verbs running throughout the series: TO CREATE and TO DESTROY. R6EW is the process which makes you a Grade VI Release . It prepares you to face the highly charged core of the bank without endangering yourself. R6EW gets most of the charge off the EWs (end words). Now, each phrase, or RI, in a GPM contains an infinitive, or verb, plus a noun. This noun, the object of the"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"infinitive, is called the End Word, or EW. The EW is the less highly- charged part of the RI since there is only one GPM per EW. The verb, though, might occur in several or all of the GPMs, thus having the much greater charge, and will bunch up entire sections of the time track if restimulated. Ergo, we have made an effort on the Solo Course materials to avoid any restim of highly charged words in the R6 bank which would spin you in on your GPMs. When giving examples or making demos, obviously unrestimulative words must be used. 245 To Catch Catfish would illustrate an RI perfectly, with infinitive to catch, and EW catfish, harmless words not occurring in the bank. Having set up your CB meter and arranged your reports, take up the solo can in one hand, a ball- point pen in the other, and ask yourself the question: What am I dramatizing? The answer must be in the form of a noun, an EW. If the word is not a noun, add NESS to it. For instance, if it occurs to you that you are dramatizing being a boy, construct the word Boyness, Boyiousness, Boyingness, or some such. If this is one of your EWs, it will read when you say it aloud . When you find an EW, register it on a small filing- card, with the date and the read. Then you must arrive at the opposite of that word. All EWs come in pairs, plus and minus, dichotomies like Tallness and Shortness. To find the opposite, the prefix UN may be attached to the first EW: Unboyingness. When the opposite is found (it must also read), thus completing a pair, it is noted to the left of its mate on the first card, and is in turn registered on a second card with date, read, and first EW jotted down next to it. The second card is then placed on top of the first and the two held together by a paperclip. There is no trick to any of this. Simply find one EW and its opposite after another, using a dictionary or book of synonyms when necessary, register them on cards and throw each clipped- together pair on top of the growing pile. Complete reports must be kept. That is the whole process: finding pairs of EWs. There may be hundreds. Do not mull over R6EW in your mind before getting to do it. If you catch yourself thinking of dramatizations, say, “THAT’S IT!” and go back to whatever you were doing. R6EW will put an end to any lingering somatics you may be undergoing. It’s an easy process. Done correctly, it’s just a walk in the park. 246 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF DECEMBER 8, 1964 Sthil Students Level Vl Staff R6 Graduates SCIENTOLOGY VI SOLO AUDITING AND R6 EW SOLO AUDITING The action of “solo auditing” is not self- auditing. Solo auditing is done in a regular session in Model Session form. One of the few ways to get messed up in solo auditing is to not use regular session form, to not keep a regular auditors report"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"and to coffee shop oneself. When the session begins, run it, when it ends, end it. If after a session you find yourself maundering around and self- auditing, you just have something wrong in what you did or found in the last session Inability’s to continue a solo audit series of sessions stem wholly from end words getting into restimutation that dictate one way or another not going on - how hopeless or impossible it is, etc. By- passed charge is not enough to stop a series of solo- audit sessions. Only end words can do it. Getting ARC Broken in solo audit is not unusual. It is handled just as you would handle an ARC Broken pc - by- passed charge assessment from a list. PRE- REQUISITES It is presupposed that a Scientologist engaged in Solo Audit is at least Provisional Class Vl. Lower levels simply can’t solo audit. What makes solo auditing possible is the fact that on processes below R6 one has communication as a necessity for auditing success. But as this necessity is part of the GPMs, when one is into R6 he or she is above this necessity. Only R6 can work without comm. Therefore Solo Auditing is exclusively an R6 activity. One supposes the auditor solo auditing has already become: Level 0. Willing to talk freely to people. Level I. Able to answer an auditing question. Level II. Able to duplicate. 247 Level Il. Free of hidden standards, overts and PTPs. Level III. Physically competent. Level IV. Has been clear. If an auditor has not passed those six vital stages of a case, solo auditing, to be blunt, is quite impossible. The self discipline won’t be there; the needful insight into one’s own motives will be lacking. Any advanced Scientologist always knows when he is dramatizing even when he is. The being that can’t solo audit never believes he or she is dramatizing no matter what they are doing or saying. Self control is a must in solo audit. The pc who still needs an auditor to progress should never be permitted to solo audit. Any pc, to go on R6 must go up through the six states listed above under levels. If you don’t take a pc through those first, that pc will eventually fall on his or her head on R6. This is all the more true on solo auditing. If an auditor or pc is started on R6 prematurely there is the remedy of doing the Life and Livingness version of the L6"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"list. Each question is cleaned of needle reads by auditing by list. Also the pc can be run on any remedy or routine that does not assess for and use words as the key reason for recovery. This only outlaws Level IV and processes depending on assessment by meter for a word to run. Even Service facs can be run on an R6 “failed case” and certainly O/ W can be run. Clay Table Healing is very good on such a case. So if a Scientologist hasn’t gone over the various hurdles as above listed he or she should neither solo- audit at all or be run on R6. REASONS FOR SOLO AUDIT The basic reasons for solo auditing are: 1. No auditor can possibly run R6 successfully on another without personally experiencing the simultaneous reads and case reactions. It’s all just unreal to a person who hasn’t seen the needle move and felt the bank shift at the same instant. An auditor without this reality just messes up pcs. There’s no qualifying or modifying that fact. It’s just true. So an auditor who hasn’t solo audited on R6 just can’t run it well or at all on a pc. Such an auditor goofs. And a goof on R6 is horrible to a pc and has dreadful reactions. 2. Auditing a pc when one’s own bank is in full cry on the very same material is not conducive to good auditing. This is overcome somewhat by using a “platen” (a card with holes in it that is put on another paper and has in it the line plot mostly written out) but not entirely. When one begins R6 he or she can be too restimulated. All banks are the same. The combined factor of no- reality on the bank and restimulation as an auditor combine with the third. 3. An auditor just starting to use All- Style Auditing is using a new tool and must have it perfect before he uses it. This is like not swimming until one knows how. The best place to learn all- style is in solo- audit. 248 You see, in solo auditing one can stop before he plows in. If one were auditing a pc, and erred, one would go on just that extra second that means disaster. From which we get: 4. In solo auditing one is not assisted by the comm cycle to go deeper than one can cope with. R6 goes straight past the usual protective mechanisms of the mind mentioned in Dianetics. Therefore when one is auditing a pc on R6 one can violate those mechanisms and get the pc in too deep. While solo- auditing one is still self- protected to a large degree. One blunders, becomes relatively incapable of going on, therefore doesn’t keep plowing in. The exception is the foolish one who sees no read and goes on down several nonreading items. Suddenly down comes the roof, even so. Thus solo auditing restores the self- protective nature of the mind which R6 done by an auditor on a pc could violate by going beyond where one should stop and investigate what’s wrong. Thus solo auditing is: 1. Possible only on R6. 2. Possible only when a person has come up through the levels."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":" 3. Possible only when one is well trained. When one tries solo on lower levels, it doesn’t work for long - but we can’t deny it does work somewhat even at lower levels sometimes. When one gets onto R6 solo before coming up through the levels it’s a jolly mess because one is having to do lower level auditing a lot of the time (PTPs and overts for instance) that only an auditor could handle on a pc. When one isn’t trained, up to R6, one can’t handle it at all. So it’s a specialized activity, solo auditing, and only for the provisional Class Vl. THE EARLIEST PROCESSES A student, just given his provisional classification, should not be given any plots of any kind. His or her first 20 hours of solo auditing should consist only of locating dichotomies of end words. Dichotomy in the dictionary means “Division into two parts.” It’s a word we borrowed and gave a new meaning to. And after all these years it is very apt as you will discover. DICHOTOMIES The dichotomy in Scient- logese means plus and minus. A plus word and a minus word. They are of the same order of things always. A crude example would be “An Apple” and “Applelessness.” That is a pair, a dichotomy. The alchemist was on the fringe of this with his active- passive forms and words. But he, looking for the gold of truth (only the latter ones looked for real gold, having missed too many definitions, no doubt), didn’t really look for PLUS and MINUS. He looked for the active, such as Man, and the passive, such as Woman by his definitions. 249 We, in a scientific age, look for the two sides of a thing, taking our cue from electricity. Plus and minus interchange a current as you will find on any battery. So we don’t want active- passive. We want the bold PLUS and ,MINUS, the Opposites. Janus, the Roman God of gates and doors, had two faces. So does each major idea have two faces. The nature of things is a major idea. It has two faces. A PLUS and a MINUS. These are opposed to each other. They interchange current. They conflict. Bad and good. Things have a nature. The nature can be bad or it can be good. Poison Ivy has a bad nature viewed from a body viewpoint. Cool water is good. Thus the nature of things has two faces, two parts. There could be, let us say the major thought, “how one feels.” This has two parts: Elation and depression. Elation is plus, depression is minus. What is generally agreed to be the unwanted or the poor side is minus. What is generally conceived to be all right is plus. In a modern society we would have the major idea that an individual has an economic status. Wealth is the PLUS and Poverty is the MINUS."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":" Now you don’t have to have the major thought to get its two parts to find a dichotomy. But the two parts must add up to being comparable. You don’t have Tall and Small as a dichotomy. The major thought of which “tall” is a part is “height.” Therefore you would have Tall and Short as the dichotomy. Small would be half of another major idea of “size.” Therefore you would have its “other face” as Big or Large. You would not have Nagging and Violent as two parts. They’re both on the same side - both minus. For nagging you might have praising. And for violent you might have benign. So a dichotomy means the two parts of a major idea. THE CHARACTER OF THE REACTIVE MIND Knowing the above you must also be informed of this: In the reactive mind the end words alternate between a plus and a minus. In the top half of the bank (reactive mind) the minus turns up and has as the next one down its plus. In the bottom half of the bank the Plus turns up and just below it is the minus. Each is the end word of a series of GPMs. Each GPM has a line plot. The most charge (force, strength, electric energy) you can find easily with the least disturbance if you err is a dichotomy of end words, a pair. They are called end words because they come on the end of each of a series of goals. Each end word has many root words. These root words are the regard or action one is supposed to have for the end word. Grab ________ would be a root. It’s the verb. Just ahead of the verb is the participle To which gives us the implied purpose. To Grab _______ as a form would be, then, the complete “Root.” (“ Root” is just our word for this To Verb .) 250 Add the End Word and you have a purpose, a goal. End words are always nouns or a condition made into a noun. Avarice might be an end word - Book or Books might be one. Thus we have To Grab Books as a full goal. Or To Shun Avarice would be one. But Books would have a lot more roots before we had done with them. So would Avarice. Each full goal, like To Grab Books, would have a Line Plot with Items like “Grabbing Books,” or just “Grabbed Books.” Now you see then that Root words are heavily repeated. But if you try to find them you may jam up many end words, for the same roots apply to each pair of end words. The same apples to items in the Line plot. Therefore the one thing that can be plucked out of the reactive mind without messing things up is a pair of end words. They discharge to some degree and as they’re not repeated except in their own series, they don’t restimulate too much. Obviously then, in theory, End words would be the least restimulative thing to find. In actual practice, they indeed are. And not only that, once found they cool off one’s dramatization of them quite wonderfully. It’s like recalling a lost"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"experience - just knowing it happened brings a big lift. One doesn’t have to erase it all to have a lot less effect from it. So, in actual practice, then, the finding of end words brings the most R6 early case gain. Further, finding these pairs cool off the bank without messing it up. Badly found end words do very little to one. Running a GPM badly can be quite deadly. ____________ STARTING R6 Therefore in starting R6, the solo auditor, regardless of the availability of the Line Plot, Root Plot and End Word (or Series) Plot, should find his or her own pairs of end words. This will tend to straighten out the Reactive Mind, unburden it and cool off the whole case. Some fantastic changes can result from this action, if it is done right . When a lot of end words have been cooled off (had some charge removed just by proving them out on a meter) one is enormously more capable. Two pairs of end words properly found is equal to about one clear in terms of case gain. But the end words to be found must be the ones in restimulation on the particular case. Just getting a standard list of end words to read does very little except maybe upset one. 251 PROCESS R6 EW The first process of solo auditing then is named R6 EW. This of course is both a coaudit and solo audit process, not only a solo process. This is very tricky as a process and the following rigid rules must be closely followed. RULES OF R6 EW 1. No Listing with paper and pencil is permitted. This means no written lists of “possible end words.” Why not? Because if you go by one in listing, it suppresses and raises the mischief. Also past auditors have loved 87 page lists. You should be able to get the right end word in about four or five words and you sure don’t need to write them as a list. Write down the first idea of it only. 2. Write down every end word found and proven on a separate card with its opposite also noted. Each end word has a card with the end word at the top boldly written with all its check out data. Over on the left in small letters is written the other one. These two cards make one pair which thereby refer to each other. 3. Never go on to a new pair before finding both end words in the old pair. Don’t find a plus, skip finding its minus and go on with another plus. Always find both before going on."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":" 4. Don’t try to plot them on the track or bank. Just find the pairs. 5. If anything goes wrong (meter hangs up, TA goes high, you feel bad, you dramatize, you want to cease auditing forever, etc.) realize you’ve got a wrong pair or a wrong mate somewhere behind you and find the right pair or the right mate (the other end word of the pair). Hence, keep your cards consecutive and in one packet, the last end word found on top and its “other word” the next one down. 6. Don’t wander off onto some other action. Such as prepchecking an end ( my God! ). Getting curious about its roots or some GPM “To Shun Cats.” Just keep after things like cats. Realize if you stray, you’ve found a wrong pair or mis- matched an end word behind you. Look for it. 7. Realize that the read of the needle transfers easily to locks if you suppress or challenge an end word too hard. But, saving grace, the one that reads I heavily on “suppress” or “challenge” (Have I challenged Cats?) is it. A suppress or challenge read on a particular end word serves to prove it. 8. Note all meter and TA actions on the card. 9. Don’t write a list between sessions. You may jot one down if it leaps up but in the next session you must take it up at once. Jotting down fifty between sessions you haven’t proved up will literally slaughter you. If you do jot down fifty, take up the first one and go down the whole list proving out the opposite of each you prove. 10. Find only pairs. If you prove out a PLUS then find its Minus. If you prove out a MINUS find its Plus. Those are the rules of R6 EW. They are far more important than how you do the process. 252 THE PROCESS This is a game like charades. (Charades: a party game of guessing a word or phrase from someone acting out its parts.) Only it’s played with this question: “What am I dramatizing?” (Or what word might you be dramatizing?” for a pc.) That’s the question. Not, as in charades, what is he or she trying to get across? But what noun is being dramatized? Not what goal (Janus forbid) but what single, nounal word. Not what pair, that would really chew one up. Just, what noun? You write down this first idea rather lengthily on your auditor’s report. Then you use that to find a single noun, singular or plural, that sums it up. You work with that written sentence until you’ve got it. Then you find it’s opposite. Remember, there’s a lot of “ities” and “ice” like “Servilities” and “Avarice” whereby what we consider as adjectives usually get made into nouns. But also nouns as nouns. Not automobiles, of course. Thetans at the start of the universe didn’t have them. But Machinery might do. Not clowns. Too specific. But “Assininities” might work. The whole question is just “What did I, a thetan, early track cook up that I am now"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"getting my head kicked in with?” “Tallness,” “Stealth,” “Hugeness,” ‘Vastnesses,” that sort of thing. One checks out the correct word to express it with usual patter. “Is this an end word?” “Does it have GPMs?” “Is it a lock?” “is it an implant?” “Is it an actual end word?” “Is it a phrase out of an engram?” “Is it a lock on a root?” ‘Is it an Item?” There’s no staccato patter that fits except “Is it an end word?” which is asked every time along with other questions. You worry at it until you know by needle action and TA blowdown it is an end word or you know it isn’t. When it definitely isn’t it is very wise to find the right wording that is the end word. Don’t just give up the notion. When you’ve got a real end word and hauled it in and written it down and why you know it is by meter behavior, you then must find its mate. Snakes travel in pairs. So do end words. Both sides of the same sort of thing. If you just found “Rotten” you must now find “Fresh” or ‘‘ Preserved” and prove that out on its card. Here’s an example: You ask “what am I dramatizing?” You think, then “Eating”. OK, what is its reaction? Well ing isn’t any end word so maybe it’s “food.” That doesn’t read. Maybe it’s “inflow.” And so on and suddenly bang, full dial, there it is, gills flippers and all, the right one that expresses that idea you had. Good. Now let’s set the opposite. “Hunger” “Deprivation,” etc., etc. And bang, you have its partner, the second fish. And so you go. 253 Pretty soon they start popping up. Check them out, get the pair, pair after pair. When it all slows down again, once more “What am I dramatizing?” And you’re on your way once more. It’s quite a process. Be thorough, be accurate, and you’ll make some long, long strides toward O. T. And in solo audit, learn how to handle All Style to the degree of checking out. And learn bank reactions subjectively and as an auditor. Only when you’ve a nice big pile of cards should you be thinking of running GPMs Item by Item off a Line Plot. Remember, even if you had the full end word plot, you’d make faster personal gains at first and faster gains as an auditor using R6 EW. It is my convinced opinion that if an auditor can’t solo audit with high gain what is now called R6 EW he or she should not be let near running GPMs, much less audit another preclear. R6 EW has been actually a research tool. When I found how to convert it to a process it already had its rules laid out and proven in research. It has not been used at this writing for case gain only by others. I can, therefore, predict several HCO Bulletins giving must- nots and all that. However, the facts remain:"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":" 1. It takes an ability to detect one’s own actions before one can detect those of others. 2. It takes unburdening to make a case run smoothly. 3. The least dangerous early approach to O. T. with the greatest case gains lies in the discovery of pairs of end words that are in restimulation on one’s own case. 4. The best way to start a new pc (who must have been through the six phases listed above before R6 plus pc training) is to use R6 EW on him. Not run GPMs. The question, “What am I dramatizing?” may be unflattering and you may prefer “What noun has been in restimulation.” If so, fine. All the same. L.

"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Sometimes the first one or the second one was the end word but is too overburdened to read. If one goes on without going back to check it then if it was the one it will suppress and things will get uncomfortable. The specific correction to R6EW is that one does record carefully each one thought of and checked over. If none have read in a list of a dozen or so end words at the very most (usually 6 or 8), go back and check the list again for suppressions and challenges. Often no suppress or challenge need be mentioned. The correct word, unburdened by the additional listing, will just read when mentioned. Major discomfort can be encountered by checking a real end word out, then deciding it wasn’t it and going on without going back to it. Thus one does need a record. R6EWS When R6EW seems a bit flat, R6EWS can be entered into. This is done like R6EW but six are found, not a pair. It will be found that the major dichotomy is the middle pair with a similar pair of end words on either side. No effort is made to arrange them in relation to each other, or the other GPMs. One just finds the six. Hence R6EWS (Routine 6 End Word Sixes). To do this, take the first pair found in R6EW and locate the additional two pairs. Then take the next R6EW pair and locate the two additional pair. All the rules of R6 EW apply. 259 R6EWP When R6EWS is reasonably flat, begin R6EWP. This means “Routine 6, End Word Plot.” To do this, first get the six you first found in R6 EWS and get them into proper relation to each other. Then take this first six found as now lined up and relate it to the second six. Then correctly line up the second six within itself. Sixes are related to each other by the auditor by numbering, by finding if there “are a lot of GPMs between,” “which six is prior to the other,” etc. In short, one does whatever is necessary to arrange all sizes in relation to one another. Of course, new sixes show up. Do R6EWS on this and relate them to the remaining sixes. This is best done with a card file. Of course all GPM end words are written on a separate card like this: 4 Jan. '65 Steam F End word LF Correct F Ice Suppress LFBD Then one has one for the opposite: 260 "},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"4 Jan. '65 Ice F Endword LFBD Correct LF Challenged LF Steam This way, when correcting any six in sequence you have a card for each and only change the opposite words about like this: 10 Jan. '65 Races F End word LFBD Correct F Walks lock Pokes- corrected opposite to F R6 EWP has two plotting steps. 1. Plot the six in relation to each other, most prior to, nearest top. 2. Plot the six in relation to the other sixes. GPMs will respond to numbering from the top as #l right on back. “Is this GPM greater than 50? Less than 50 from the top? Greater than 40, less than 40? Is it 41, 42, 43 - Is it 43? Plots as 43rd GPM from the top.” Sixes respond to “prior” and “nearer the top.” “Is this six prior to the cough six? Is it closer to the top? The cough six is prior.” 261 SUMMARY This is all rather easy to do. The main point is that R6EW, R6EWS and R6EWP must all be pretty flat and the end word plot correct before you even try to run Items and GPMs. Don’t do R6 EW, then get eager and start to run GPMs Item by Item. Flatten R6EW, then go on to R6EWS. Then go to R6EWP. Then start on Items. You’ll have it much easier. The only real way to get slowed down is to try to run Items before the bank is thoroughly unburdened with R6EW, R6EWS and R6EWP. Three months of heavy auditing would run out the whole bank anyway. Why rush? If you try to rush it, it’ll take a year or two. You’ve been aberrated this long, a few months can be tolerated - and for that matter, a year or two on the lower levels also. The only way to not make it is not to do all of Level 0, Level I, Level II, Level III, Level IV and all of R6 as above. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: jw Copyright (c) 1965 by L.

QUITTING ON R6 Tendency to quit or blow doing R6EW always stems from (a) past R6 errors; (b) dramatization of a missed end word; (c) failure to locate an end word one is dramatizing; or (d) failure to get large reads. Mismatch of pairs, wrong form of end words are the most serious errors and will lock up the meter. One must also remember that the bank itself dictates a cessation of action. A case in point is an end word “Impossibleness,” resulting when not found but restimulated, in a cessation of solo Clearing. The point is that one doesn’t quit for P. T. reasons, no matter how good they sound. One quits or slows down or blows solely because of end words or GPMs. “It’s always an end word” is an excellent maxim for patching up any upset. By the way, this is true also at lower levels but in this case one hasn’t a prayer of getting at the end word and if one did try then the resulting mess would be too hard to repair 80% of the time. One lucky break in locating the end word on a lower level Pc can ruin an auditor. Afterwards, he keeps trying and flunking. For you have to have a Pc in comm and a bank 264 unburdened to run R6 successfully. If older schools of practitioners ever contact this portion of our data, we can predict with confidence that they will fail miserably in all efforts to apply it for they have not begun to walk the bridge in the right place. To succeed with R6 data they would have to embrace the whole of Auditing and its ethics as well and they wouldn’t be older practitioners then, would they. Auditing is all of a piece. A auditor has to know his lower levels. And a Preclear must walk the bridge from where he can have a reality on it. END WORD FORMS There are two sources for end words in each GPM: 1. The end word of the one oppterm; and 2. The end word of the goal and other items. The one oppterm, as per the line plot, has the end word as a forthright noun. In that oppterm, “boy” (if it were an end word, which it isn’t) would be BOY. In the goal as an RI and the goal as an oppterm, it would be BOYNESS or BOYIOUSNESS or BOYINGNESS. The suffix NESS is the clue here. It seems to occur uniformly in the goal as an RI and the goal as an oppterm. Therefore you can get two apparent forms of end word. One is the forthright noun occurring in the normal oppterm. The other is a modification, adding - NESS and sometimes - FULLNESS or perhaps -INGNESS, -LINESS, or - IOUSNESS. "},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The idea is very plain. Just knocking out a boy would be a small action. But knocking out things which knock out boys would be a much broader action. Therefore GPMs in their goal items have an end word ending in the NESS form of the noun. PURPOSE OF THE BANK The probable purpose of the bank is to suppress all creating and destroying by aiming creation at evil and destruction at good. This apparently was to restrain all creation and destruction and so gives us the Mest Universe. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: jw Copyright © 1965 by L. Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 265 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF JANUARY 25, 1965 Sthil Students R6 Graduates Sthil Co- audit DEFINITIONS DEFINITION OF TERMINAL The word “Terminal” in Scientology is a homonym - which is to say it has several definitions each according to how it is used. The Pre - 1962 definitions of a terminal were (and are) anything used in a communication system: something that has mass in it. On processes below Level III use a proper nounal form in an auditing command - don’t use ‘sleepy’ or ‘sleepiness’ in the command- use ‘a sleepy person’ or ‘a sleeper’ Use, in other words, a terminal in the sense that it must have mass. Also a terminal meant (and means) “something with mass, meaning and mobility” Also a terminal means “anything that can receive, relay or send a communication” To wit, a ‘bullet’ though it has mass, would really be a communication particle and the shooter and target would be the terminals. What is at cause and what at effect are the terminals when you are using a comm formula of cause - distance - effect. This is the commonest use of the word “terminal” in Scientologese. You hear a Scientology saying - “he gave up because he didn’t have a real terminal” or “he wasn’t a good terminal” meaning in both cases that there wasn’t anybody to talk to or listen to even though there were people about. A person who could gives relay or receive comm was a terminal and a person who couldn’t wasn’t a terminal. Electrically a terminal is one of the two poles between or through which current flows. In GPMs, what we now also call Items were first called terminals because they interacted with each other electrically. They were always in pairs. These are composed of a (1) mass and (2) a significance. They only interact with the pc or the matching terminal. The pc or the matching terminal can act against the remaining terminal. Also we got the idea of two different types of terminals in GPMs, because that’s the way they are. One, the pc thinks of as his own or himself. The other he thinks"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"of as an opposition. Hence, we use “terminal” to mean what the pc thinks is his idea and mass in the GPM, and we use “opposition terminal” or “oppterm” for short, to mean the mass and significance he thinks of as the enemy to the one he is in. Both the “terminal” and the “oppterm” in a GPM have mass and significance and have the appearance of receiving and giving communication and so they are called terminals. 266 When one is speaking of either one “term or oppterm” and isn’t being specific as to which it is “term or oppterm” one says “Item” An Item can also be anything that reads on an assessed list, particularly if it is an adverbial or adjectival noun or a proper noun. So “Item” is a broader, sloppier term which includes a terminal of any kind. THE WORD “NOUN” Noun is most properly and severely used to indicate a specific something rather than a condition. Boy, cat, sparks are nouns. These can be converted to nouns which only identify a condition with the characteristic of the forthright noun, such as boyishness, cattiness or sparkability. Here we see a noun made into a condition which in English is called an “adjectival noun” or an “adverbial noun”. Reversely, adjectives, adverbs and verbs can be turned into something loosely called a “noun” which is only an adverbial or adjectival noun. Responsible is an adjective; Responsibleness is an adjective turned into an adjectival noun. You see the end word of the goal as an RI going both ways. If the proper, forthright noun is really the subject of the GPM (lets say BOY) this occurs as part of one oppterm. But the goal as an RI converts it to let’s say Boyness, making the forthright noun become an adjectival noun. The other way to, if the GPM end word occurring in the goal as an RI is HIGHNESS, then in the one oppterm it becomes HEIGHT. English suffers a bit from lack of differentiation in its grammar and terminology but we get around with it somehow. If there is an academic terminology for such differences, then it is insufficiently in general use to communicate the way we have to be able to do. I know words to describe these things in another language but not in English. There are no proper forthright nouns as end words to the goal as an RI in GPMs. There are some in the one oppterm each GPM has that describes the accomplished fact. This becomes a NESS in the goal as an RI, which data is all we’re really interested in. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: jw Copyright © 1965 by L.

Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 268 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFEICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF MARCH 5, AD15 Sthil SCIENTOLOGY VI R6 EW GOOF A REVIEW OF R6 EW During my absence in early 1965 somebody varied the R6 EW rundown on students and it suddenly “ceased to work”, of course."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":" When looking for why a process isn’t working the general human impulse is first to blame the pc and say the pc is different, then try to vary the process. Almost never is there an impulse to see if one was running the process right in the first place. Yet, on these mainline processes that are part of levels particularly, the fault is never the pc and varying the process is fatal. So I am furnishing the impulse that’s missing. Look for the variation first. One always looks for how the process was alter- ised in the first place and one is nearly always right. So it was in the case of R6 EW. Knowing all this from long experience, when I found R6 EW had “ceased to work”, I directed that several students be asked, with no HCO Bulletin before them, how they were running R6 EW. And sure enough, they were running a variation. That was the source of the slow terminations and stalled cases. The variation wasn’t much, but it was enough to raise Tone Arms and freeze needles solid and make people very unhappy physically. The twist was as follows: the students were being permitted to list for dramatizations. This of course merely stirred up end words as By Passed Charge. There is no such step in R6 EW. By listing for dramatizations, an assessment step was introduced, the purpose of R6 EW is to find end words, not to get all steamed up about dramatizing as in Service Facs. So in effect R6 EW was reduced down to Level IV, but being improperly addressed to the bank (the dramatization, not the end word), restimulated GPMs by being nearly on. Listing of end words is forbidden in the original HCO Bulletin of R6 EW. Noting down what one has checking was provided for in the second HCO Bulletin on R6 EW. No HCO Bulletin mentioned listing for dramatizations, heaven forbid! I never dreamed anybody would enter in the Level IV Service Fac step into Level VI. That was really reaching. Maybe the word “dramatizing” was not grasped. What one wants to know is “What end word explains my condition?” So if you have any trouble grasping “dramatizing” as a concept, just fall back or “What end word explains my condition?” and the purpose of 269 R6 EW will be fully understood. To Dramatize Something means to be the effect of the bank. But to vary a process rather than try to find what’s misunderstood about it is very, very humanoid. If one had a complete command of all the parts and relationships of the mind and a background of uniform success as an auditor since 1950 (and many have, including me) and had been a D of T and a D of P and had run the Saint Hill Course and had studied thousands of cases and case histories and graphs, then one might possibly vary a process. But then such a person would also see how the recommended process worked and that it didn’t need varying and so would be the last person to change it. In my experience, only the poor student with bad graphs on pcs ever varies processes. An organizational parallel is the fellow who, knowing nothing whatever about an org, its purpose and patterns (and successes) comes in, sits down at his new desk and promptly starts telling everyone how the org should be run. He may find some listeners right up to some idiotic point like “All pigeons should be sold.” “But we"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"don’t keep pigeons,” says an old staff member, starting to see the light about this fellow. To which the newcomer snarls “Then buy some so they can be gotten rid of!” So I always assume two things on reports of trouble with a mainline process (a standard one that has a working history): 1. The original process has been varied; 2. Whoever brought about the change has had a bad record on courses and on pcs. That way I can easily trace back failed training and the source of variations. And I have yet to find this formula for unearthing trouble with processes wrong. Today as a result of hard experience, I regard any listing process with great reserve. Not because they don’t work. (In the hands of expert experts they do.) But because there is something about listing that doesn’t lend itself to training. I knew there was an impulse to overlist. I have seen some poor preclear made (by a student auditor) to list 89 pages of items, going black in the face, TA soaring, needle frozen, and yet the auditing student just going on and on and on, demanding more and more items. I have seen underlisting as a chronic impulse, Three items and the auditor called it a list, although the needle hadn’t even stirred yet. Now I have seen an impulse to inject listing into a process where it was forbidden. So we can say that some tend to be odd on the subject of listing. It’s probably itself a dramatization of implants - they are in long sequences. So we lay the rule down that in Level VI you don’t list. In R6 EW on dramatizations, you write down the first dramatization thought of. That’s it! It didn’t have to read or check or be assessed. Now find an end word to fit it that reads well by thinking of it, writing it down or seeing if it reads. 270 While thinking of it, writing it down or repeating it. If it reads at any one of those times, well, that’s it. If it doesn’t read a nice long read, you think of another, write it down and see if it reads. Again it can read while (a) thinking of it, (b) while writing it down, or (c) repeating it once or twice. If you have about six and none have read with a long fall, go back to the first one and check it again and either it or the second or third one you wrote down now reads like a bomb, having been unburdened. That’s all there is to finding an end word. No additives. There is no “check out”. Blow the idea of “ness” or any other idea. Don’t bob around mauling it. Now find its opposite same way. Think of the probable opposite, of the one you’ve got; write it down and see if it reads. If it does that’s it. Start worrying when you start creaking and the TA starts rising. When that happens, do a BPC assessment, Beware of missing a read while you’re writing something down. Use one of those glass paneled E- meters if you wish (and bend its brass stand leg so you can get paper and pen behind it easily, don’t paste paper on its back so you can’t see the needle. It’s made to look through at your paper and hand, putting the needle between the writing hand and eye so you can see the needle move if it does)"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" Honest, it’s too easy. There are two versions of an end word - the more specific noun goes with the third oppterm from the top. The “ness” goes with the goal as an RI and others. Endless correcting of what you find will get you in more trouble than not checking what you find. The suppress and challenge you put into the bank by constant checking are worse than a few wrong ones. You don’t have to work at it. Just keep a good auditors report and write what you find. Sometimes when you’ve found an end word, a string of other end words go off like fire crackers or you keep thinking of them one after another. Well, write them down noting their reads. Find their opposites when they slow down in coming and you’ve got a bonus lot of pairs. (But always find their opposites. And always write them down as they occur.) Indeed, after you’ve been on R6 EW for a few weeks the question about dramatizing becomes useless and you just find end words. When this happens, you’re due for R6 EWS as there is now enough charge off the bank and enough kinks out of it to go back and use your pairs to make sixes. When R6 EWS no longer limits itself to sixes but keeps going off into 12s and 18s, you’re due for R6 EWP. For now enough charge is off that you’re placing by number is accurate. (They number from the top as # 1 of course) Use cards for each one you find. Keep a regular auditors report but audit mainly on 3\" x 5\", or some other measurement cards instead of “work sheets” so you can move the cards about in sequence. Date every card with the session date and fill in the opposite word on each card. 271 You can of course check out an end word to see if it’s an actual or what. But don’t make it a habit for every word. Some you know are it. Be happy. When more charge is off the case, they’ll then be seen as right or wrong when doing R6 EWS. Why worry during R6 EW? Did the end word take charge off your case - big needle falls 2\" to 3\"? Okay that’s your purpose. You don’t have to plot the bank in R6 EW. That’s later in R6 EWP. You’ll catch all serious R6 EW errors you make in BPC assessments or R6 EWS anyway. Wrong end words hang up and plague you. You keep thinking of them. They don’t blow. So a check can be relegated to checking those that hang up in your attention during or after a session, or those that turn everything black or white. Don’t be so careful. During the day or night, if you don’t really begin and end your sessions like an auditor, more end words will pop up. Write them down. Don’t be running back to a meter. Next session, start with those. And get pairs to complete your notes. “End Words” that mess you up with pressures or heavy somatics are incorrect or incorrectly paired. Straighten them up. Honest, it’s easy to do. The only side effect if you do as above comes from leaving the two roots unexpressed. One tends then to dramatize them. Or from by- passing so many items."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" Really, it’s an easy activity. It’s lots of fun. It’s mainly quantity you’re after, not quality. So you drive at 100 mph until you have a wreck. Then you patch it up and again drive at 100 mph. Sometimes you get pretty nervous and reluctant to drive at all, too many wrecks. If so, you missed by- passed charge, so go back on an assist basis and build up your nerve again and shortly you’ll be “doing a ton” (driving 100 mph) again. You can’t kill yourself on R6 EW. You can by running wrong goals item by item. So that’s why you’re doing R6 EW rather than GPMs item by item. It’s safer. If you had the exact list of GPMs when you started R6 EW you would still get further I think on R6 EW. Although GPMs are the same, pc to pc, they are not keyed- in the same way on each pc. R6 EW gives you a chance to key them out the way they’re keyed in on you. So please, do it. And let’s not vary it, eh? L. RON HUBBARD LRH: jw Copyright © 1965 by L.

Sthil R6 Students Sthil R6 Grads Sthil R6 Coaudit SCIENTOLOGY VI R6 EW GOOF The primary errors that produce upsets in any process are of three kinds: 1. Not doing it at all (including no auditing); 2. Altering the procedure, (by which is meant doing something that is close but has a twist in it, including using it for the wrong purpose); and 3. Adding to it. ADDITIVES Almost all procedures have suffered from additives - which is to say, having things added to them. (Complexity- Simplicity covered as a subject in an ACC, probably the 15th). Man is far less likely to do something simply than he is “complexly” due to the reactive bank which dictates it “should be that way”. In R6 EW, a very important reason for small or insufficient Tone Arm action is the tendency to add steps or actions to the procedure unwittingly. Given a simple session form which starts and ends it, goals for the session and toward the end a summary of the session goals made or not; an R6 EW session doesn’t have anything else. PTPs, overts, almost any part of levels O to IV are now hard to get reads on and if looked for or fooled with may freeze the T. A, if introduced into an R6 EW session."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" Only By Passed Charge searches can be done in an R6 EW session (and have to be done by oneself or another when things are grim). If you try to audit yourself after you have ARC broken yourself without locating and indicating the BPC you get pretty apathetic. Otherwise there isn’t anything you can profitably add to an R6 EW session “to improve it”. To add other auditing actions to an R6 EW session can be quite upsetting. The PTP, overt or motivator turn out to be the effect of dramatizing end words that you would have found anyway almost at once had you just continued R6 EW. Trying to scan off locks after finding an end word, listing dramatizations, adding any action to the very elementary actions of R6 EW all just slow the TA action and get the needle dirty or sticky. Look over your procedure if you’re in trouble, using the following steps: 1. Do you really not audit at all? 2. Are you doing a twist on R6? 3. Have you added some steps that you figured should go in but I never mentioned? If you are having a rough time look over these HCO Bulletins on R6 Goofs and check your procedure out. Maybe you haven’t spotted all the additives. Also, have you departed R6 EW for R6 EWS before the time was ripe? That’s an additive for sure. LRH: ml L. RON HUBBARD Copyright © 1965 by L.

Yet it has come to my attention that many are still running GPMs according to the line plot as released, or if not doing this are running actual GPMs using end words which they have located. The plots they are finding are incorrect. The full plot is not yet released. Therefore, all Class VI students, should only be running R6EW at this time and nothing else. To do this they should take care to answer the question “What am I dramatizing?” The answer to that question should be noted down on the auditors report form. It does not matter how this is phrased. It could be, for example, “the feeling of having butterflies flapping around inside my stomach” or “cold feet” or whatever. You find the end word just like in the bulletins. Check it out and find its opposite. Then you look to see whether or not you still have “the feeling of having butterflies flapping around inside my stomach” or “cold feet”. If you still have the manifestations of such a dramatization, you continue to find end words and their opposites until you have completed a cycle on that particular dramatization. When this cycle is complete, and you will know when it is complete, then you would again ask the question “What am I dramatizing?” and proceed as above."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":" All this requires is some ability to recognize what it is you are dramatizing. No figure- figure is required - just an ability to perceive an existing state, condition, emotion, feeling, sensation, inability or lack of emotion, feeling or sensation. Make good use of a dictionary and a book of synonyms and antonyms. This will keep an auditor busy for quite some long time as there are many more end words than last released. When it appears that there really are no further dramatizations, the auditor can then proceed to R6EWS as given. It will be unlikely that any auditor will have to do R6EWP, as all the end words have been found and are currently being plotted by me right now. 274 R6EW and R6EWS will remain as a procedure even when the end words have been completely plotted as it is the very best way to get off vast quantities of charge and to ease the actual running of GPMs. All Class VI auditors should immediately upon receipt of this bulletin, study all the previous bulletins on R6EW and R6EWS and proceed right away to run R6EW as given and when that is handled, run R6EWS. You have been given the form of end words. Be sure to only find end words in this form. There you are. Get busy and try to get in at least five hours of solo auditing done on yourself each week. By the time you have found hundreds of end words and by the time you have found hundreds more with R6EWS, R6GPMI (item running) will be complete for you here at Saint Hill. The whole message here is to continue to find end words until the dramatization is flat. Otherwise you’re leaving unflat processes behind you. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: wmc Copyright © 1965 by L.

Further assistance after first termination and 9 above may be had only by re- enrolling on the course. A Checkout as Clear may be had at Saint Hill without charge. The reason for such a schedule is the number of solo auditing hours required and that R6- GPMI is easy if steps up to it are well done and training has been good.

(5) Training up to Provisional Class VI. (6) R6 EW to 4th Stage Release. (7) R6 GPMI to 5th Stage Release. (8) Completion of case and Clear. As the route becomes more apparent and more heavily traveled, the above order of events is optimum. Some persons have attained 4th Stage Release by R6 EW without the lower stages being declared. Nevertheless, it will be found on careful examination when R6 EW produces a floating needle and proper TA that all the lower Release stages usually have been attained by earlier auditing over the years by the pcs and that R6 EW will not function to free needle on many cases unless those cases are Power Processed.

Ron Hubbard A Release is a person who has been able to back out of his Reactive Mind. The Reactive mind is still there but the person is not sunk into it with all its discomforts and depressions. The person has been released from his Reactive Mind. He still has it, but he’s not in it. His IQ and ability rises and he is far more effective in changing his environment into a better one. Above Release lies Clear. “Clear” is the name of a button on an adding machine. When you push it, all the hidden answers in the machine clear and the machine can be used for proper computation. So long as the button is not pressed the machine adds all old answers to all new efforts to compute and wrong answers result. Really, that’s all a Clear is. Clears are beings who have been cleared of wrong"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"answers or useless answers which keep them from living or thinking. The Reactive Mind in its entirety is known territory today. It contains false purposes and makes people lose their own basic purpose. An uncleared person is making himself the unknowing and unwilling effect of his own Reactive Mind. A Reactive Mind is an unknowing, unwanted series of aberrated computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him. It is also an obsessive strata of unknown, unseen, uninspected data, which is forcing solutions, unknown and unsuspected, on the individual. It is a sub- awareness activity. That is, below the knowing awareness of the individual . The Reactive Mind opposes the individual. Now the way you handle the Reactive Mind is simply to increase the individual’s awareness. By increasing his awareness, he becomes aware of this thing and so it’s now under inspection, and as he goes along, he can then handle it and it’s under his control and ceases to be reactive, no matter what’s in it. Life is quite an adversary and the Reactive Mind is quite an adversary. You shouldn’t ever undervalue these things, and therefore you can’t really overvalue the State of Clear. It has never been achieved before. The last big stumbling block to freedom- the Reactive Mind itself- has been found out, explored and conquered. The technology to reach these states is in practice in your nearest Church of Scientology this minute. All you have to do is obtain the auditing and skill available. The thing to do is keep going up. Get your Grades of Release, one by one. Keep taking the next step up. Release and Clear are reached by small certain steps, not by huge leaps. Now is the time to start. You can make it. 287 THE STATE OF CLEAR by L. Ron Hubbard A Clear is a being who can be at cause knowingly and at will over mental matter, energy, space and time, as regards the First Dynamic (survival for self). For more than 2,500 years, Man has dreamed of this goal. Being Clear gives one the freedom and potential of being. Further. it makes it possible to continue being something. It is a stable state. Also, a Scientology Clear has experience. The source of aberration is the Reactive Mind, and the source of the Reactive Mind is the Being himself. An uncleared person is making himself unknowing and unwilling effect of his own Reactive Mind. A Reactive Mind is an unknowing, unwanted series of aberrated computations which bring about an effect on the individual and those around him. It is also an obsessive strata of unknown, unseen, uninspected data, which is forcing solutions, unknown and unsuspected, on the individual. It is a sub- awareness activity. That is, below the knowing awareness of an individual. The Reactive Mind opposes the Thetan. Now, the way you handle the Reactive Mind is"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"simply to increase the Thetan’s awareness. By increasing his awareness, he becomes aware of this thing and so it’s now under inspection, and as he goes along, he can then handle it and it’s under his control and ceases to be reactive, no matter what’s in it. There is no such thing as a crazy Thetan. There is a Thetan who is mocking up craziness that he is the effect of. He does this automatically, and does not know he is doing it. He does not see the things which are affecting him. A Clear, then, is no longer the effect of the automaticities of the Reactive Mind on the first Dynamic. Because of pleasurable experience in the past and inherent sensitivity, there will be differences amongst Clears, and Clears should not be assumed automatically to be a standardized middle ground that: pale goal of past doctrines. Rationality as divorced from aberration, can be studied only in a Cleared person. It is the aberrations of the uncleared individual which give him the appearance of irrationality. Irrationality is simply the inability to get right answers from data. Now, in view of the fact that the mind does more than its share of pinning somebody inside a body, there are no conditions imposed on him. Clear he can more easily become exterior . A Clear doesn’t have to be in a body or out of a body; there are no conditions imposed on him. He is just at cause over mental matter, energy, space and time on the First Dynamic, or as regards his own survival. Life is quite an adversary and the Reactive ,Mind is quite an adversary. You shouldn’t ever undervalue these things, and therefore, you can’t really overvalue the state of Clear. It has never been achieved before. 288 **CLEARING COURSE INSTRUCION** ***************BOOK*************** READ, STUDY AND KNOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE DOING ANY AUDITING. MECHANICS OF THE BANK Anything in the bank that occurs several times will not erase unless it’s the earliest time it occurred. This is known as the basic on the “chain”. A number of similar things, early to late in different points of time make a chain. When you have the earliest erased, the rest erases easily. However, when the earliest one is erased the next to last is the new “basic” and must be erased in it’s turn. And so on. As this goes on, the items of the chain eventually begin to “blow” (erase) very easily. "},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Therefore, if Items cease to erase easily, you have not properly handled the Item just before it. And may not have handled the same item in the earlier run. Even if you get reads out of a later run than the one you are supposed to be in, you will find the later one still reads when you get to it properly and will then erase nicely. The real sneaker in the R6 bank is “the person himself at the time”. This we call “the thetan” in the Item. Each Item has an impression of the being as he was at the moment of the item long ago. If one does not spot this each time, it will not erase and mass builds up as we go along. This means look at or locate yourself as a thetan at the time of the incident. It is not the light. It is right where you are in the auditing chair, but of course, ages past. Spot means “glance at”. q = Greek letter theta. q n is a trick way of saying theta- n. If, as you read this, you can glance at the wall, you can spot. It reads well. One then has to get the earliest moment of one’s own beingness in the bank and “spot” it. Then one has to spot it for each Item one runs. One “spots the thetan” and the Item or (in the Objects) the Items, at the same time. This is a bit of a trick. It is “simultaneous spotting”. Spotting the thetan in a called (verbal) Item can be done at the same time as the Item is called. Ordinarily, one calls or spots the Item a few times and then also calls and spots the thetan. The thetan can also then be spotted without calling or spotting the item. The right way is the way you get the most reads. Soon one begins to be expert at it, but then one must be expert at it with Item 1, Part 1, Run 1 or it builds up. One had a tiny bit of mass on him right at the start, as he was protesting. This is (slight as it is) enough to tie down the chain by leaving it with a basic. So “spot the thetan” each time. Spotting the environment at the time is also possible. 289 DURATION OF AUDITING Find a quiet place in which to audit. Audit an hour or two at a time, preferable the same time each day. A day you don’t audit is a session lost. Trying to make up a session is useless. Audit daily. When you don’t you lose sessions. It isn’t how much you get done in a session, it’s the getting on, bit by bit, that counts. It’s like digging a long ditch. What you don’t dig isn’t dug. The bank contains less than was first thought but it contains enough. In three or four months you will have make it if you do a good job on each Item. And don’t fool about with the bank. It goes into restimulation if you stir it up. And don’t decide a lot of things. Your ability to postulate is increasing and you can decide a run is “flat” or doesn’t need to be run and have it behave that way. But it will still be there to knock you down. THE CAUSE OF TROUBLE "},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The only way one can get ill, or in trouble, is not auditing, in trying to “correct” the Items given, or, in not following instructions. What doesn’t make Items read properly: Loud shouting. Body movement while calling. Fiddling the one- hand electrode. Tensing muscles. Getting angry with the lack of a read. Gritting teeth. Auditing past an ARC break. Doing a List 7 every time you don’t get a read or feel odd. What makes Items read properly: Doing regular sessions. Not self auditing out of session. Staying calm. Keeping calm. Keeping the Auditor’s Code on the pc (you). Following directions exactly. Adding nothing. Finding ARC breaks (when they happen) with a List 7. ( List 7 run as an assessment for ARC Break will run easily. Locate and indicate the by- passed charge as it shows up. If you are not a classed auditor, get this done in a Qual Division that has a classed auditor either on or through the Clearing Course. If you really bog down, Auditing by List 7 will give you the relief sought.) Auditing in a place you feel secure and where you won’t be disturbed. Audit daily. Not auditing too long at one time, 1 to 2 hours is optimum, closer to 1 than 2. Not trying to get rid of it all at once. Considering it a routine piece of ditch digging. Not expecting to fly suddenly. Not dwelling on your case out of session. When you end a session, end it. 290 Being plodding and methodical. Just getting on with it, getting all the reads off by calling or spotting, going on to the next item, if it doesn’t read, get more off last item and return to the one that wouldn’t read. Getting in the buttons Supp., Inval., Protest, when needed only. Checking for earlier or later runs only when in trouble. Only handle trouble when it arrives. Don’t try to handle it before it does. The best way to stay out of trouble is READ, STUDY AND UNDERSTAND THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE BEGINNING. BASIC BASIC The first (earliest) bit in the bank is not an Item but a light. It appears to the left front of the face, some distance away (look ahead and to the left a bit and you’ll spot it). It is the source of unconsciousness and produces it when contacted. There is a light before each Run, in the middle of each 7’s GPM (every 4 pairs), at the start of Basic End Words, at the start of Confusion GPM, and at the start of the Objects and at the end of each type of Item in the Objects (every 8 Items). Each time you feel groggy, it’s a light doing it. Each major change, then, is preceded by the light. Mark these in on your platens if they are not there. Flatten each one by spotting it, and it and thetan. Anaten (unconsciousness) can be spotted away. It is part of the light. When the light went on, the thetan went anaten. Instead of a Solo Auditor going anaten in his session, it is only necessary to spot the anaten in the thetan when running the light. When you spot a light or object or combination of objects, you should get a read on the needle. By spotting the same thing again, you get another read. By spotting it"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"again, you get another read. And so you continue to spot it, time after time, until no more reads occur by reason of spotting. You repeat verbal items aloud, getting a read each time you repeat until it has no more reads. Verbal items are found in the “7’s”. “Basic End Words” and “Confusion GPM”. But you silently spot lights, objects, combinations of objects repeatedly (same one) until you have no more reads. You should get as many falls, etc. from spotting a light as you do from calling an Item. Spotting the thetan follows the same rules. You spot repeatedly until there are no more reads on the needle by reason of spotting the thetan (self) at that instant and place. You don’t have to see the light to spot it or see the thetan or see the object or objects. You only need to spot the place where they are with the idea of what should be there. Of course, seen at first or not, continued spotting makes it blow. 291 PATTERN OF THE BANK The apparent pattern of the bank is as follows: etc. for 10 “runs”, total. There are five PARTS. These occur in a row. This row of 5 parts is called a RUN. The first, earliest, of these is the “7’s”. The second, just above the “7’s” is the Basic End Words. The third, just above the Basic End Words, is the Confusion GPM. The fourth, just above the Confusion GPM, is the Objects - hollow. The fifth, just above the Objects - hollow is the Objects - solid. After a RUN of A, B, C, D, and E we begin again with the “7’s” for the next RUN. The parts go as they do in the first RUN. (“ 7’s”, then Basic End Words, then Confusion GPM, then the Objects - hollow, then the Objects - solid.) Therefore, the trick is always to run only the earliest run available and not get into later runs. The bank has 10 runs or 50 parts. None of these use a GPM Line Plot. They only contain what is given on the platen you are issued. The proper way to run it all is to get on with it. After 10 runs, you may have to go from Run 1 to Run 10 all over again anyway, to get any final bits. So your first running of the whole 10 runs may not be your final run. (Earliest) Part A - The “7’s” Part B - The Basic End Words Run 1 Part C - The Confusion GPM Part D - The Objects - hollow Part E - The Objects - solid"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":" Part A - The “7’s” Part B - The Basic End Words Run 2 Part C - The Confusion GPM Part D - The Objects - hollow Part E - The Objects - solid Part A - The “7’s” Part B - The Basic End Words Run 3 Part C - The Confusion GPM Part D - The Objects - hollow Part E - The Objects - solid Part A - The “7’s” Part B - The Basic End Words Run 4 Part C - The Confusion GPM Part D - The Objects - hollow Part E - The Objects - solid 292 HOW TO USE A PLATEN Each student must supply himself with foolscap paper. The platen is then laid aside the foolscap paper and you repeat the number on the actual foolscap paper. Across the top of the foolscap paper is written the student’s name, the name of the part being run, the number of the run, and the date. The reads on the Items are written on the foolscap paper alongside the number of the Item. To keep from cramping your reads and have enough paper on all parts, just take legal (foolscap) size paper and use the items consecutively numbers and go down the page as far as necessary to record all reads, then leave a space and write the next number. It is too hard to keep the numbers even on the platen and worksheet. Number work sheet by page number of platen + consecutive letter. Page 1 of platen becomes Page 1A + B + C of worksheet. Label each worksheet well. In order to save paper bulk, continue down your piece of foolscap paper from session to session, dating each new session start. Use both sides of your foolscap paper, but use separate Auditor Reports for each session, of course. "},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Any comments that need to be written down must be put on another sheet of paper. Only the actual reads, including any buttons that are used, and any cognition’s, should be written on your foolscap paper. Do not write the name of the items, only the pair number and item number. Leave some space on your foolscap paper when you complete an item, so that if the next item does not read, you then have sufficient space to go back and add more in if necessary to the previous item. Do not write anything on the platen. When you return your auditor’s reports and worksheets always use paper clips. Never use a stapler on this course. 293 JOE BLOGGS RUN PART 8.5.65 Page 1A Light . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Complete the part. Go to first Item in next part, etc. One calls the Item and marks it’s reads until one no longer gets reads. Then one calls the next Item and marks it’s reads, until it no longer reads. Then one can call the first item of the pair again and second Item, calling them as a pair until they no longer read. The reads obtained on an item by calling a pair are put under the appropriate item number. All the reads for any one item are recorded in the"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"same place on the worksheet regardless of when the item is called. (Such as calling as a pair or in rerunning). Space should be left after each item so that reads can be added when calling the pair or in the case of having to go back and get more charge off an item. Whenever you move the Tone Arm down mark on your worksheet (BD -) and put the new T. A. position in the Blank Space, e. g. (B. D. 3.0). If an item does not read the moment it is called, then you have left the Item just before it charged. So call the earlier Item again and get the read or reads off it, making sure you don’t go into a later run. Then call the item that didn’t read the first time and you will find it instantly reads. When you leave an item to go back to a previous one, put a / on the item you leave and a - at the item you go back to. If you go back more than one item, put a / for as many items as you go back. I. e. if you go back three items, you put /// on the item left and - on each item gone back over. Each item must be called in turn up to the place where you went back from. NOTE: This can easily be overdone (getting all reads off earlier items) as you can put yourself into later runs, so moderation in this goes a long way. But never ignore the fact that a new item didn’t read the first time it was called. It always means you didn’t get all reads off the Item immediately before, or that you failed to spot the thetan at the moment. NEVER go past a non- reading item. When running Clearing Course material, you find you get a certain amount of reads on an Item (correct ‘run’ type reads are Fs, LFs, sBDs, BDs) then the following Item in the same session will get approximately the same amount of reads - if not and you get only a few reads, then go back to the previous Item that read well and you will find there is more charge on it. After that the next Item will read with approximately the same number of reads as the previous one. One doesn’t muck about with concepts or other maunderings. The Item is the Item and cognition’s do or don’t appear. The Item is the thing and calling it is what makes it read. If the Items go on reading don’t try to suppress them. Items read big and many times. You may get as many as 25 or more large reads on every Item. The main thing is to clear (get all the charge off) each Item for the run you are in. Be sure to keep in the correct run. Remember, if you get bored with so many reads to take the boredom off as a button. You can just throw away reads because you get tired of seeing it read. Your purpose is to clean each Item, not make yourself interested or happy or entertained. A lot of it is just hard, slogging work. If you clean them up as you go, all will be well. 295 You can sometimes erase an Item and have it then read as a lock or a lock Item. Test it for a lock if it reads too long. If you find you are getting small reads, i. e. ticks, small falls, check to see if there is any charge left on the previous item, and check to see if you are in the correct run. Falls and blowdowns are expected on each Item, not just small reads. Don’t go on calling the item if you are getting small reads. Find the outness and correct it. Keep Auditor’s Reports for each session. Don’t try to run the same Item out of all runs at one time. Just proceed from"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"bottom up, run by run, in order, Item by Item, part by part. Take care to stay in the correct run. It is now a proved fact that none of the Basic Bank will erase on a preclear until all the lower grades are properly established on a preclear and then the Basic Bank confronted in it’s exactness, item by item in sequence and in it’s exact relationship to the rest of the Bank. Know then that (1) there is no haphazard blowing of Bank (2) no item blows out of context (3) there are no prior holes blown in the Bank for anyone, no matter what the nature of any prior auditing might have been, until the item has actually been run. PAIN Pain (pn) occurs only when you left something charged behind you. (earlier). SICKNESS Sickness is part of the somatic. It runs out. FLATTEN Flatten every Item thoroughly. ERASURE You are not seeking Release from the bank at this level. You are erasing. Therefore “the bank has blown” is nonsense - one has blown from the bank, so get back in it and run it. Total erasure is the aim. NO READ No read on a new item is always followed by long falls and blowdowns. Never by- pass an Item just because it didn’t read. Sure passport to upset is to leave Items alive and go on or to skip an Item because it didn’t read. They all will read. RERUN If you start getting pain or sickness, you got into a later run or you bypassed some charge and must rerun the earlier area you just did. Something is still alive. If in doubt, re- run the lot from the start of the part. Erase thoroughly. But if it is a later run, get back into the correct one. NEGLECT If you run upwards getting no reads at all on several Items and still go on, you will become quite upset. Do not go past non- reading items. Find out what is wrong immediately and remedy it. BY- PASSED CHARGE: Use L7 on yourself if you don’t quickly find reasons for pain or upset. READS Write down, using the code, every read you get after the Item that it occurred on. Write “no” for Item that didn’t read at first read, even when it then"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"reads. 296 Example: “ No LFsBDFFFsBD”. RELEASE You’ll go Release a lot of times. Ignore it. We are erasing in R6. Release can be ignored because the R6 bank is vanishing. Not true of Lower Grades. TA UP The TA goes up between sessions. IT cleans up and goes down on beginning rudiments or on the first couple of Items or both. REPEATER TECHNIQUE: The Items are flattened by repeater technique. Just repeat them until they no longer read. Get your own reaction off. Repeat again. Repeat to no read. Beware of session Suppress and Invalidate. PART B Is nouns. Be careful of first one because it is used in the sense of a noun. Don’t run it otherwise than as a pure noun. READS It is not unusual for an Item not to read at first call. Read the one just before it again. Try the Item once more. If still no read, call several just before it. Then call it again. It will read. Items read many times in most cases. Don’t leave anything reading behind you. Sometimes you will find a pair you just left are still very alive. Flatten them Mark ALL reads or lack of them. WOODEN FACE: A wooden feeling in the face is caused by pulling later items that are also pulled in out of arrangement. If you pull in from later bank (runs) X and Y you will not get a wooden feeling in your face. But if you pull them in Y X you will. CODE ( USED IN NOTING READS ) F = 1” to 2” fall (needle left to right motion) LF = long fall 2” or more sF = small fall 1/ 2 to 1” ht = heat experienced pn = pain som = somatic sen = sensation corr = correct supp = suppress inval = invalidate no rd = no read sBD = small blowdown of TA. .2 div. or .1 (right to left motion) (needle sticks over to right - TA does not necessarily have to be moved.) BD = 1/ 4 division blow down of TA or more (right to left motion) (TA has to be moved) Div = division of tone arm TA = tone arm of meter, scale of anaten = analytical attenuation (going unconscious) 297 PARTS D & E THE OBJECTS - HOLLOW AND SOLID These parts are silent. There are no words in them, only objects. They run in a pattern. The position of the objects relative to the thetan are: The Objects appear about an arm’s length away. On coming in or going away, the location is the same. For 1 Object, it appears a few feet in front of one’s face. For 2 Objects, they appear to right and left of one at same height as the front"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"one. For 3 Objects, they appear combined as 1 and 2 Objects positions (in front face and to right and left). For 4 Objects, they appear as the 3 plus one behind the head about the same distance back as the one in front is. They move. Learn to perceive the number given all in the same instant, doing the action of going away or coming in. Spot the thetan at the same moment. Seek to perceive the object or objects, don’t call them. Perceive them as going away or as coming in, as given. If the mass stacks up, you are missing spotting the thetan. Go back and spot it. (yourself at the time). It is an easy run. If you grind at it too hard you will get into the same run repeating as a later run. If you have pain, you have missed a read. Or you went into a later run. If you have severe pains, you’ve gotten into a later run. If your eyes burn, you have invalidated something. 298 MISTAKES AND ILLNESS About the only thing that can make you ill on the Clearing Course is your own error, losing your place on the plot, skipping or re- running. Between sessions, little can happen you cannot repair. But, at the start of a session, you may pick up, in error, something you have already run, or skip and pick up late. (i. e. you have done 133, you start at 129 the next session. More seriously, you have not done 141 to 144, but begin the next session at 145.) If you skip 4 items and do a light, you will surely become ill. By illness is meant, “colds”, “flu”, “dysentery”, etc. To prevent becoming ill, be very careful of your place, very careful to pick up where you left off, very careful not to skip. And you will do very well. If you do become physically ill, down in bed, it is almost certain you missed items and did a skip. And further, you must have been PTS at the time (connected to an SP). No Clearing Course auditing may take place during pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs, send your folder to the Clearing Course Supervisor who will keep it until after the birth of the baby. L.

A C/ S, Clear or above, in an AO, Saint Hill or Class IV Org is held full responsible for maintaining the security of this confidential HCOB and the material it contains. 2. The HCOB is to be kept securely under lock and key as Confidential Advance"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Course Material. 3. The confidential data herein is not to be divulged, verbally or otherwise to anyone . . . . it is also not to be copied or reproduced. 4. Feeding the Clear cognition to any individual, or violation of any of the above, is a Comm- Evable offense. 334 If a mission or Field Auditor believes one of their pcs to have gone Clear, they will send the pc and his folders to their closest org which has a C/ S who is Clear, for a full Dianetic Clear Special Intensive. The following definition of Clear is non- confidential and may be ( and has been ) used in promo or other publications given Issue Authority for release. DEFINITION OF A CLEAR: A BEING WHO IS UNREPRESSED AND SELF DETERMINED. CONFIDENTIAL DATA A Clear has lost or erased the matter, energy, space and time connected to the thing called MIND. He has been cleared of the MAS, PICTURES, etc. in the bank or mind. It is a negative gain. CLEAR COGNITION: CLEAR OCCURS WHEN ONE STOPS MOCKING UP BANK, OR REALIZES THAT HE IS MOCKING IT UP OR HAS BEEN MOCKING IT UP. THAT IS THE CLEAR COGNITION: THE REALIZATION THAT HE IS OR HAS BEEN MOCKING UP THE MASS AND PICTURES, ETC., THAT MAKE UP THE BANK. When the person arrives at this realization he can then, of course, cease mocking up bank. A Clear has perhaps not entirely lost the automaticity of mocking up mass. But at least he knows he’s putting it there and practice increases his general reality. The person who has actually gone Clear will express the Clear Cognition, or some version of it, upon going Clear or at some point on the Dianetic Clear Special Intensive. He must have expressed this in some way for the C/ S to know he has in fact gone Clear and before being permitted to attest. The State of Clear . . . can be achieved prior to doing the Clearing Course. It can occur on Dianetic auditing, especially New Era Dianetics. Sometimes it has occurred on Goals Processing, and even on Objective Processes. It is not, however, attained by feeding people cognition’s. Clears are made through auditing. Non- Confidential Verifying and Declaring the State of Clear When the individual, before doing the Clearing Course, thinks he is or might be Clear, or when he has read on a correction list ( such as a C/ S 53, Green Form, etc. ) as having gone Clear, he must be given the Dianetic Clear Special Intensive to verify the State and rehabilitate it , if valid. When the steps of the Dianetic Clear Special Intensive have been thoroughly done to full End Phenomena and a full resurgence of the State, the person may be sent to attest to the State of Clear. ( Ref: HCOB 2 May 79, Iss I, DIANETIC CLEAR SPECIAL"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"INTENSIVE. ) 335 The state of Clear must be acknowledged and declared when it has been validly attained and verified. Programming The Dianetic Clear For Further Auditing A Dianetic Clear must not be run on engrams, R3RA or any version of R3R or Dianetics. A Dianetic Clear does the Purification Rundown and the Survival Rundown if he has not had these. He is given the Scientology Drug Rundown ( unless he has already completed a full NED Drug Rundown or other Dianetic Drug Rundown ). He is run on Expanded ARC Straightwire and Expanded Grades 0 - IV to full ability gained for each Grade not previously standardly declared. (NOTE: He would not be run on the R3RA section of the Service Fac handling on Grade IV, however. ) He can be given Touch Assists or Contact Assists ( as can Clears and OTs ) but not a Dianetic Auditing Assist nor any Dianetic Auditing. When each Grade has been handled to Ability Gained, the next step is the Solo Auditor Course at a Saint Hill or an Advanced Org. A Dianetic Clear is not run on Power, R6EW or the Clearing Course, but, upon completion of the Solo Auditor Course, goes directly onto OT 1. This HCOB is issued to Org C/ Ses who are themselves Clear or above as the Clear cognition cannot be issued broadly and must not be fed to a pc, which is a Comm- Evable offense. Clears are made through auditing, not by feeding EPs or cognition’s to pcs. This is important as someone who has not made Clear will not make it on OT levels. Org C/ Ses who are Clear or above, however, will need to be able to recognize the State of Clear when it occurs on Dianetics or otherwise, to ensure (using the steps of the Dianetic Clear Special Intensive ) that the State . . . is real and to declare any such pc . . . Clear when the State has been truly attained. Once declared, the person’s pc folders must be clearly marked “DIANETIC CLEAR”, for security and for purposes of further programming. The individual is then issued the Standard Clear Certificate by Certs and Awards, which states simply that he has attained the State of Clear. This Standard Certificate bears no qualifying statement of the State. Once the person has attested to Clear he may then be C/ Sed for further auditing, per the programming data above. I am entrusting Clear C/ Ses with the responsibility of ensuring that the Confidential data herein is kept secure, so that each and every individual may honestly male it to Clear and go OT.

Ron Hubbard “The total content of the reactive mind, then, is entheta held down by physical pain engrams which form the mass that causes later enturbulated theta to be ‘permanently’ trapped.” “The physical pain brings about the ‘permanence’ of entrapment, but the auditor will find his greatest store of entheta which he can covert into theta, in secondaries and locks.” “A clear, technically, is simply an individual from whom all physical pain engrams, all secondaries, and all aberrative locks have been erased.” “Being a clear does not mean being a re- educated or a re- environmented or a regeneticized individual; but it does mean that all possible free theta in the case can be brought to bear on the problems of the environment and the future and that all the data in the analytical memory bank is available for the solution of those problems. “The clear can receive new engrams, but these must be of a very severe nature to be highly aberative, because it is the early engrams on a case which produce the greatest aberration and effect on the individual. However, do not mistake the fact that heavy intentional engrams hammered by ferocious physical pain into a clear, should that clear have been basically low on endowment of free theta, may produce a psychotic break. But do not expect that engrams once erased and the entheta exhausted from the reactive mind will then return in some strange fashion. The will not, once they are properly addressed and converted. It takes new physical pain to produce more engrams in a clear. A clear will, however, become enturbulated by the environment, but will enturbulate temporarily only and will suffer no after effect from the enturbulence since there is nothing to trap the entheta.” 337 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East, Sussex HCO POLICY LETTER OF 17 JANUARY 1967 Remimeo Franchise FSMs All Students All Preclears BPI AN OPEN LETTER TO ALL CLEARS You are a Clear. Well done and congratulations. This state has not previously been attained in this universe and we must all work towards getting more people- many more people- up to this level. Essentially, you are clear on the 1st Dynamic and still have a lot of work in front of you to attain OT, which is to say the remaining dynamics, but nevertheless you will find you have many abilities hitherto undreamed of. An ethical code already exists for OTs so at the state of Clear one should not assume that one has a license to do just whatever one will. You still have the remaining dynamics to go so don’t use the abilities you have attained already to enslave others, or indeed, yourself. With freedom comes responsibility and with responsibility comes the need to assess one’s actions and to take only such actions as will do the greatest good over the greatest number of dynamics. So, the Policies of Scientology which have enabled you to reach the state of Clear still apply to all Clears. In fact they apply more because you have the reality of their value and the necessity of seeing that they are followed."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":" Those who have not yet attained Clear will be watching you with some awe, so you have the duty of setting an example of exemplary behavior in all aspects of your life. As a Clear you have no privileges beyond being declared Clear. As a result, bigger responsibilities will be given and expected of you so you must be prepared to responsibly educate yourself where necessary so that you can do whatever is assigned to you in a proper manner in keeping with the main goals and aims of Scientology. So for you there is no sitting down and resting upon your laurels, no waiving of policy, no promiscuous 2nd Dynamic activities, no improper assumption of power, control or influence or assuming that you automatically know best in every situation. It is a crime to invalidate the state of Clear- see to it that you don’t do this in your conduct as a Clear, particularly as regards yourself. You still have the rest of the dynamics to go. You have now become more than ever a part of a team. Obsessive individualism and a failure to organize were responsible for our getting into the state we got into. As soon as you have gone the rest of the way this will become abundantly plain. I expect and need your help to carry out the broad mission of de- contaminating this area of the universe. If you wish to help, your first duty is to protect the repute of the state of Clear by exemplary conduct. Your second duty is to attain OT as soon as possible. Your third, if you still wish to help, is to become part of the endeavor to clean up this sector of the universe and make it safe not only for ourselves but the billions of others who have been harmed. As a Clear you are welcomed and honored. Don’t do anything that will wear out your welcome or bring dishonor on yourself or upon other Clears. Thank you for what you have done so far. Thank you for what you will do in the future. I know I can count on you. L. RON HUBBARD Founder 338 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 13 NOVEMBER 1981 Limited Distribution Grad IV C/ Ses and Auditors, Clear (or above) in Class IV Orgs (or above), ONLY. C O N F I D E N T I A L THE SUNSHINE RUNDOWN The Sunshine Rundown is a brilliant new rundown that adds sparkle to the State of Clear. It is the next step after the DCSI on the Grade Chart. It is done Solo but does not require a Solo Auditor Course as a pre- requisite. The Solo Auditor Course is the next step after the Sunshine Rundown. (Academy training may also be done after the Sunshine Rundown, not further processing ) It may only be delivered in Class IV Orgs or higher orgs. Theory The auditing a pc receives up to the point when he goes Clear is subjective (i. e. the pc looking"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"inward into his mind and down the track). The DCSI which follows picks up any loose ends of BPC and rehabilitates the State of Clear; it too, is subjective. The Sunshine Rundown is an extrovertive action that puts the Clear into communication with the present time environment, perhaps for the first time. Certainly it is the first time that he is in direct perception of the environment, without a bank in the way’ Procedure The Clear is audited on the DCSI, the folder C/ Sed and sent to declare the State of Clear. After the declare, the auditor ( or a D of P qualified to do so) hands the Clear the envelope containing the Sunshine RD, ensures that he understands the instructions and sends him off to do it. When the Clear completes the Sunshine RD to its EP, he goes to the Examiner and attests to having completed the Sunshine RD and writes a Success Story. His certificates for the State of Clear and for the Sunshine RD must have been prepared in advance by Certs and Awards and routed to the Registrar. The Clear is routed from Success Officer to the Registrar. (His attestation and Success Story are put in the folder and sent to the C/ S, but the Clear is not held up for this.) The Registrar presents the certificates, congratulates him and informs him that his next step is the Solo Auditor Course (or training to Class IV) and signs him up for it right away. Where the film, The Solo Auditor, is available he should be shown the film. 339 The Clear should then be started on his training as soon as possible and will be eager to do so. (But if there are any bad indicators, notify the C/ S and Qual Sec immediately.) C/ Sing The C/ Sing is very simple. When the DCSI is complete, the C/ S C/ Ses the folder to: 1. Examiner to declare the State of Clear. 2. The auditor (or D of P) to issue the Sunshine RD envelope. When the folder is returned to the C/ S with the Sunshine RD attestation and Success Story, the C/ S checks these to ensure that all is well - or acts instantly to get the Clear reviewed. The only possible errors on the Sunshine RD itself are that it was overrun or not completed. But a bad indicator after the Sunshine RD would be most likely to be due to an earlier outness, missed on the DCSI or even that the person was not Clear after all. (But that would mean that the auditor and C/ S had goofed badly on the DCSI.) The first action to take if the DCSI was successful, but the Sunshine RD was not, would be to have an auditor fly the ruds and then meter check whether the Sunshine RD is overrun? Incomplete? If overrun, indicate and rehab as needed to F/ N. If incomplete, send the person off to complete it and then to Examiner to attest, Success Story, etc. If the above did not fully resolve the matter, or if there is any doubt about the DCSI, or if the Clear exhibits BIs (Bad Indicators) later (including not moving up the Bridge), C/ S for a “C/ S 53 to F/ Ning list” - by an auditor who has done the Assessment Drills (per HCOB Apr. 80). Should it turn out that the pc was not Clear, repair any upset and return the pc to NED DRD or NED (whatever step the pc was on). And retread the auditor and C/ S and"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"get the auditor’s TRs and metering in per HCOB 22 Apr 80 ASSESSMENT DRILLS, before attempting another DCSI or Sunshine RD. Fortunately, these errors and repairs are not likely to be necessary and you will find that the Sunshine RD is very easy to C/ S and extremely rewarding. Cautions Be sure to ensure the confidentiality of the Sunshine RD. Do not permit it to be spoiled for others by carelessly leaving the materials where they can be read or by discussion of it within the hearing of others. Ensure that the instructions are handed to the Clear in the envelope provided, which must be clearly marked as confidential. It could spoil the rundown for another if he were to read or hear the instructions and self- audit on it before the appropriate time. Always report any breach of security to the Ethics Officer and GO. Ensure that when people are signed up for the DCSI that they are also signed up for the Sunshine RD at the same time, that they sign a promise not to reveal the materials nor to discuss them with others who have not had these rundowns or within their hearing. Ensure that Success Stories on Clear and Sunshine RD do not contain confidential statements or excerpt these out before posting or publication. (Also ensure that plenty of these Success Stories are made known’) 340 Always deliver the DCSI and Sunshine RD as a package, preferably the Sunshine RD should be done the same day that the person declares Clear. There must be no delay from the attestation to the Sunshine RD and Success Story, to the Registrar. The Registrar must have the certificates to hand and the forms to enroll the person onto the Solo Auditor Course. The Qual Sec and C/ S must act instantly to handle any BI (Bad Indicator) following the Sunshine RD, should such ever occur, and wherever possible get the person to session and repaired before leaving the org, or called in for repair immediately when the BI is noted. If, for any reason, the Sunshine RD is not done immediately after the Clear declare, the auditor must fly the person’s Ruds (if there is no F/ N) before issuing the Sunshine RD instructions. The Examiner must collect back the envelope and instructions when the person attests and must return these to the C/ S. Do not try to persuade a Sunshine RD completion to have other auditing, but encourage him to continue on up the Bridge. (The only exception would be when the Clear reaches a higher org for solo set up auditing, even then sufficient time must have elapsed for the Clear to enjoy his win -and it is a big one’) If any abbreviation is used for the Sunshine RD, use “SunRD” so as not to confuse it with the SRD (Survival RD). When the D of P or Registrar is Clear and has had the Sunshine RD (or if they are already of higher case level) allow them to read this HCOB for their enlightenment. Then the D of P can issued the Sunshine RD instructions after the Clear declare, saving precious auditor time. Ensure that the routing form for DCSI and Sunshine RD is used and ensure that the line is drilled to flubless before starting deliver- and from time to time"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"thereafter. Although this is the hat of other executives, you as the C/ S are also responsible to ensure that such drilling is done or even to do it yourself if necessary (C/ S Series 56, 57).

It is now possible to make a far superior solo auditor than ever before.) PART ONE (The Hubbard Solo Auditor Course has been divided into two parts to enable Scientologists to get started on the route to Solo and OT, in Class IV orgs. This enables more Clears to make faster progress up the Bridge. Part Two of this course and OT Preparation, are done at SH orgs or higher orgs. ) NAME:____________________________________ DATE STARTED:____________ ORG:_____________________________________ DATE COMPLETED: ________ PREREQUISITES: 1.

A Mark VI E- Meter. USE OF SOLO AUDITOR TRAINING FILMS: The training films included on the Solo Auditor Course, though seen by the student at specified points on the checksheet, are not limited to one showing of a film per student. Once a student has seen any one of the Solo Course films initially, the should see the film again as many times as required during the course. PURPOSE: Part One of the Solo Auditor Course has been made available at Class IV orgs to enable the student to make progress toward becoming a Solo Auditor. Part Two is available at SH (and higher) orgs. The Solo Auditor Course (Part One and Part Two) is designed to give the data and drills needed to make a superb Solo Auditor. CERTIFICATE: The graduate of Part One and Part Two of the Solo Auditor Course is awarded the certificate of HUBBARD SOLO AUDITOR. STUDY TECH: This course is studied per HCO PL 25 Sep 79 I URGENT IMPORTANT, SUCCESSFUL TRAINING LINEUP. Students who are not Fast Flow, per HCO PL 25 Sep 79 I, are to starrate and be Method 4 Word Cleared on those items on the checksheet marked with an asterisk (*). Full Study Tech is to be applied throughout the course. Study the data in checksheet order. It is vital that you do not go past a word you do not fully understand. Make full use of the Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary and a regular dictionary for any words you do not understand. NOTE: If, in doing the drills on this checksheet, the student cannot perform an earlier drill that applies, the supervisor must give the student a “pink sheet” to redo the earlier drill he has missed. This includes issuing a pink sheet on any applicable material of the study prerequisites for the course, should this be required for successful completion of the course. NOTE: Your success on the OT Courses is dependent upon your diligence, full application of study data and honest application of the materials of this course. It is vital that you do not pass yourself on any materials, drills or auditing actions until you are fully certain you have understood and can competently apply the data and skills. Your future on the route to OT depends on this. The Solo Course is complete within itself. However the student must realize that there are many courses available to make him a top line auditor. Any student desiring higher auditor training may also become a Class IV Auditor by doing Academy Level Courses and a Class VI Auditor on the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. The Hubbard New Era Dianetics Course, while it. is not a prerequisite for the Hubbard Solo Auditor Course, is also recommended for the student who desires further knowledge of the mind. 347 SECTION ZERO INTRODUCTION"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":" 1.

Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades” entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this policy letter are HIGH CRIMES resulting in Comm Evs on ADMINISTRATORS and EXECUTIVES. It is not ‘ entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a 2- year slump. IT IS THE BUSINESS OF EVERY STAFF MEMBER to enforce it.

I AM REISSUING IT NOW, IN 1980, TO AVOID AGAIN SLIPPING BACK INTO A PERIOD OF OMITTED AND QUICKIED FUNDAMENTAL GRADE CHART ACTIONS ON CASES, THEREBY DENYING GAINS AND THREATENING THE VIABILITY OF SCIENTOLOGY AND OF ORGS. SCIENTOLOGY WILL KEEP WORKING ONLY AS LONG AS YOU DO YOUR PART TO KEEP IT WORKING BY APPLYING THIS POLICY LETTER. WHAT I SAY IN THESE PAGES HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE, IT HOLDS TRUE TODAY, IT WILL STILL HOLD TRUE IN THE YEAR 2000 AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD TRUE FROM THERE ON OUT.

ALL LEVELS 365 KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and all new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can’t get the technology applied, then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised. "},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results.” Trouble spots occur only where there are “no results.” Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are “no results” or “bad results.” Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied. So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper manner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. 366 Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not- too- bright have a bad point on the button Self- Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. In all the years I have been engaged in research, I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long- run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I repented and eventually had to “eat crow.” On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So 1 know what a group of people will do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology.” By"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as “unpopular,” “egotistical” and “undemocratic.” It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don’t see that popular measures, self- abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self- abnegation has filled the Southeast Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not supported me in many ways, I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its formative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or coordination of what has been done, which will be valuable- only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defense, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreciated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture. 367 We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact-- the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatizations of the bank called “new ideas” would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve- psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc., ad infinitum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish. So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed, the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N. J.; Wichita; the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"done. The bank- agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell- and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every man, woman and child on the planet. That is bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opinion” media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is destructive. When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the bank- dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. 368 It’s the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the bank that says we must fail. So just don’t play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor, “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of “new technology” and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all that happened. This is what he should have done: Grabbed the Auditor’s Report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so, she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: That Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Q’d and A’d with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases.” All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That process X didn’t work.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your Auditor’s Report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?” Then the pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained their certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recommended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one had (a) increased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the auditor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. “Of course his Model Session is poor but it’s just a knack he has” is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels O to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E- Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he “overcompensated” nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at “set.” So everyone was about to throw away standard processes and Model Session because this one student “got such remarkable TA.” They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough Model Session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hidden under a lot of departures and errors. 369 I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of offbeat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control, and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. BUT no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased. Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from noncomprehension. Usually the noncomprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology, they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper instruction is vital. The D of T and his instructors and all Scientology instructors must be merciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"turn the sluggards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait until next week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the universe- never permit an “open- minded” approach. If they’re going to quit, let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they’re aboard; and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the rest of us- win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half- minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby- pamby bunch of panty- waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive- and even they have a hard time. We’ll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly, he becomes more and more tiger. 370 When we instruct half- mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that lets everybody down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humor her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist. Now we’re going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead than incapable.” Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear. But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get, the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow, our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s our possible failure to retain and practice our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of “unworkability.” They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":" Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past.

REASON: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pressure exerted to speed up student completion’s and auditing completion’s was mistakenly answered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student’s progress is by using 2 way comm and applying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When the product vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet. L. RON HUBBARD FOUNDER Revised by CS- 4/ 5 Approved by L.

Esto Series 35RB Word Clearing Series 60RB Product Debug Series 7R MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS AND CYCLES OF ACTION MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS AND NO PRODUCT A misunderstood word can prevent a person from understanding the remainder of what is heard or written. I have now discovered that: A MlSUNDERSTOOD on any given subject CAN PREVENT THE COMPLETION OF A CYCLE OF ACTION related to that subject. Therefore those people who don’t complete cycles of action on certain subjects have a misunderstood word on them. This then results in no- product situations. Therefore when you are getting no product, look for the misunderstood word on the subject no matter how long and arduous it is. It’s there. And when it’s found the person can go on and complete a cycle of action and get a product. CAUTION: Make sure the person actually does have an inability to complete a cycle of action before you get into handling him. You don’t handle somebody who is completing cycles of action that result in production. MISUNDERSTOODS AND PERCEPTION Misunderstoods can also act as perception shut- offs. They can actually interrupt a person’s perception. It is quite astonishing that perceptions such as sight. sound and even touch can be shut off by Mis- U words. This opens the door to the fact that people apparently do not see, hear, notice or handle outnesses when they have Mis- Us on them. This also may open the door to people who have perceptic shut- offs, such as poor eyesight, deafness other perception difficulties. 374 MISUNDERSTOODS AND COMPLEXITY Misunderstoods lead to complexity. People who have Mis- Us in an area are inclined to develop vast complexities. They can generate confusion’s and complexities beyond"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"belief. People do this because, having misunderstoods, they do not confront and duplicate in the area and so get into a lot of think- think and unnecessary significance. Their ability to get things done in that area dwindles as a result. And at the bottom of all this is simply misunderstood words. MISUNDERSTOODS AND TOTAL ORGANIZE When you see an area that is organizing only, you know that area is loaded with misunderstoods. When people have incomplete cycles due to Mis- Us they get bogged down into organization . You can tell when people have Mis- Us- they are totally involved in organize, organize, organize. They don’t know what they are doing. There is a level below this- they have overts and withholds which prevent even organizing. Below that level people are PTS. Lacking a sense of organization actually lies below this. It is below the level of Mis- Us, overts and withholds and PTSness- and you’d have to go north through PTSness and overts and withholds to even get to the Mis- Us. MISUNDERSTOODS AND NO ORGANIZE There can also exist a condition where someone does not organize any corner of his area or work or organizations or lines. l his manifests itself by irrational demands to only produce and to prevent any organization so that production can occur. At the bottom of this you are very likely to find misunderstood words, particularly on the purpose of the production or why one is producing. It is in this sector that you get overt products most frequently. HANDLING The exact procedure for handling these Mis- Us is given in HCOB 17 Jun 79 CRASHING MlS- Us: THE KEY TO COMPLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS. Crashing Mis- U finding is done as part of HCO PL 23 Aug 79 1 DEBUG TECH.

This law at once explains why communication, ideas or application become falsified, twisted and corrupted. This law is of great use in Word Clearing: A. It indicates who has to be word cleared FAST, at once, NOW, before duties go off the rails any further. B. It detects the area just before which there is a misunderstood word. A is useful to the administrator. Knowing it and knowing Word Clearing and being able to do it himself or get it done, he can avoid wholesale dismissals, frantic transfers, general inefficiency and organizational strain. B is very useful to the Word Clearer. Example of B. A person can do everything on an order except “File the Folders” which he insists on delivering to a wrong room. Look over the order and find where in it talks about filing folders. Just above or beside that will be a misunderstood word. Locate it, get it identified, defined and used in sentences. The person can suddenly file folders! Just BEFORE or WITH the point a person begins to alter will be found a misunderstood word. Thus 1. Discover what a person alters. 2. Find what came just before that. 3. Find the misunderstood word. 4. Get it looked up. 5. Get it used in sentences as long as it moves a meter tone arm. 6. End off on F/ N VGls.

The history of BPL 18 Oct 76 and its revisions is of interest because there have been some six people involved in writing and rewriting the various versions of this issue. Each sought to solve some real or imagined problem with training, by going unusual and altering or changing LRH Policy on training. As a result, arbitraries were entered into training and LRH Tech was dropped out of use. Each time this happened, training became less effective and slower. Instead of getting back to LRH policy on training each new revision entered a new arbitrary and omitted a vital piece of LRH Tech. LRH has discovered that the troubles others have been having with training are due to: (a) the introduction of arbitraries and (b) omitted use of the Tech. 379 Nothing in this issue cancels or alters any LRH Policy, nor does anything in this issue permit anything less than full use of LRH Tech. BPL 18 Oct 76RD had become long and difficult to read during all these revisions. The valid points from it follow in this issue. STUDENT HAT COURSE The Student Hat Course was put back onto the Training Route in 1976 by LRH when it was discovered that the course had disappeared from use. (See HCOB 24 Jan 77 TECH CORRECTION ROUND- UP) FAST FLOW TRAINING Definition: “A student attests his theory or practical class when he has fully covered the materials and can apply them. There is no examination.” (LRH ED 2 INT) The fast flow student passes courses by an attestation at Certs and Awards that he (a) enrolled properly on the course, (b) has paid for the course (or signed a no- charge invoice for 2 l/ 2 or 5 year contracted staff), (c) has studied and understands all the materials on the checksheet, (d) has done the drills called for by the checksheet, (e) can produce the result required in the course materials. Twin checkouts are suspended. Examinations are not required . Following are the rules of Fast Flow Training: l. The only prerequisite for A student, staff or public to be able to Fast Flow his courses is Student Hat and Method One Word Clearing. Where a student has already done the full Primary Rundown, he is also qualified to Fast Flow his courses. 2. Method One Word Clearing must be fully done with each word taken to F/ N as well as F/ Ning the final assessment. 3. False attestations on Fast Flow Training equals a condition of Liability for the student and immediate cancellation of the cert and loss of Fast Flow Training privileges. FAST FLOW AND QUAL On Internships, the do the starrate checkouts required on each other. High Crime"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Checkouts and cramming actions requiring starrates are done starrated and not fast flow. 380 (Per HCOB 24 Jan 77 TECH CORRECTION ROUND- UP. ) STAFF HATTING The only prerequisite for staff hatting is BSM (Basic Study Manual ) done per the checksheet. PRD ( Primary Rundown is not a prerequisite, nor is a Student Hat, nor Method One. Where a staff member has only done the BSM he must not Fast Flow his training, and must take exams to graduate . Staff members are urged to do the Student Hat and Method One as early as possible and must do these before a Major Course anyway. Staff can get Method One, by coauditing it, from student auditing or in staff auditing. (If staff co- audit Method One, they get the added advantage of learning how to do word clearing.) SUPERVISION It is important that supervisors ensure that students are applying study tech at all times and pinksheet any outness they find. In Fast Flow Training it is important that ethics is put in for any and every false attest, or the gains which can be gotten from Scientology training will get lost. WHAT IS THE SUCCESSFUL TRAINING LINEUP? It consists of following and keeping in the LRH HCO PLs on Training found in OEC Volume 4, making full use of LRH Study Tech and not allowing it to be omitted and keeping arbitraries off the line. Then there would be no trouble in training really professional Auditors, C/ Ss, Supervisors, Administrative staff and Executives, rapidly and in great quantity. The Tech works when you use it. Use it and make competent people. L. RON HUBBARD FOUNDER LRH: DM: gal Copyright © 1979 L.

The pcs became ill or misemotional toward us. And just the day I write this (original writing 4 October 1965) I myself encountered a pc, very ill, who had had some original R6 data misused on her and did not suspect why her case and health had worsened. She was not ready for it at all. The issue earlier was a trial balloon, in a sense. I found certain persons (a small minority) were not up to responsibility for the material of April 1964. Therefore our firm action will be that the moment we find the material of the Clearing Course or Course has escaped or been misused we will quickly trace the person who was insecure and cut off all further or any future Clearing or data issue to that person The likelihood of independent discovery even with clues has proven to be non- existent by actual review of auditors trying to find pieces of it when they had over half of the answers already. You must realize that we suffer, all of us, from the misuse of knowledge concerning the mind at a very early period. To place this data near such people as psychiatrists or even states places them in a position to enslave people or repeat the original action and cave people in. A very small minority, receiving incorrect data did promptly use it harmfully on others after April 1964. Until we ourselves have climbed well out of the hole, we must safeguard the materials. Our case gains depend on it. And others could make our salvage of people impossible. We do not safeguard these materials from any commercial consideration. Our futures, those of each of us and those of all Scientologists, depend on our keeping this material under lock and safeguarded from abuse until we are well away as a group and can handle things better as individuals as well as a group.

Full Solo Line not under 1 In Charge. Having no Review Auditor or Auditors in the Solo Ad- Course line up, but sending pcs to “Review” and jamming them into HGC backlogs. Letting a student onto Solo Auditing who can’t audit and hasn’t been trained to audit. Giving a Solo Student his materials while he is still studying basic auditing. Letting files or materials get in any confusion. Letting security go out on the Solo materials line. Failing to C/ S sessions. Not having a Solo Unit. Not applying the C/ S Series. Not making students attain the EP of a level before going on. Using next levels to handle what’s wrong with a case. Not seeing Solo and Advance Course are well attended and promoted and sold. Failing to get blows or incompletes back in and handled. Lose track of a student after sending him for intensives and not being at all times aware of who is on Solo lines. Feeding EPs to students. Failing to be courteous and friendly and helpful to Solo students. ______________ 386 These are the major faults which slow up or stop the Solo- R6EW- AO flow lines, cost wins and income and keep orgs who have AO lines from being prosperous. If you were to take the above as a checklist and go over the Solo lines, each point found in violation would be a major WHY as to low income and upsets. For instance the Solo Supervisor is not just responsible for the Solo Course. He is"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"responsible for ALL checkouts of ALL solo and Advance Courses INCLUDING R6EW. When there is no IN CHARGE for the whole line, Solo, R6EW, clear to VII on up there is no one to regulate and coordinate flow so it doesn’t flow. If there is no Solo Review Auditor then a patch up can only be done by sending the person to the HGC where an inevitable backlog bars the person off Solo for days, weeks or forever and kills all further course wins and sales. Review for a Solo student must be immediate. It is of course charged for. The only way a Solo student gets off this one line is by be sent to Cramming. That should be a one day action at the most. If Mini Courses have to be taken by Solo students they are taken under the Solo Super. This doesn’t say that the Solo Course Supervisor cannot have persons for Admin and other Course Supers under him. As for Promo, when an AO begins to specialize in intensives, lower grades and Class IV actions they are taking business away from Class IV orgs and SHs and not wearing their own hat. Thus Solo Courses MUST be promoted. Nothing in this Policy Letter may be interpreted to mean that a Solo sign up can’t be audited on anything but fast reviews. It is totally possible that a person signed up for Solo R6EW may be found to need several intensives and be given them. As long as 1. The student IS signed up for Solo and 2. He is not shunted over into HGC backlog but is actual gotten into auditing with actual intensives being given in rapid succession like one or two 12 1/ 2 hour intensives a week. If these conditions can’t be met the Solo line is justified in expanding its own review. All manner of irregularities can occur on Solo lines. Like giving a “10 day Solo Course” at R6 level and then letting the student who of course could never learn to audit in 10 days, fall flat on his head from there on out. The line up is given in C/ S Series No. 5 and C/ S Series No. 5 Addition. Solo Courses can and do produce the most fantastic wins and case gains. It is up to those entrusted with the activity to make it so. L RON HUBBARD FOUNDER LRH: nt Copyright © 1971 by L.

RON HUBBARD Copyright © 1968 Founder by L. Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 393 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 22 MAY 1969 Remimeo Dian Checksheet DIANETICS ITS BACKGROUND The world before Dianetics had never known a precision mental science. Man has used mental knowledge in the past mainly for control, politics and propaganda . The word “psychology” in the popular usage is synonymous with “getting around” somebody. In the thousands of years before 1950 there were many philosophers and much knowledge was gathered in the field of logic, mathematics, electronics and the material sciences. However, due to ideologies and political conflicts, little of this prior knowledge was ever applied to the field of the human mind. The scientific idea of regarding as a truth only that which could be demonstrated with a result was never really applied to the mind. “Researchers” in this field were not fully trained in mathematics, the scientific method or logic. They were interested mainly in their own private ideas and in political Targets. As an example, the only “schools” of psychology taught or followed in the West were Russian and East German. The primary school was that of Ivan Petrovitch Pavlov (1849- 1936) a veterinarian. Every school child and university student was required to study Pavlov in one disguise or another. The burden of Pavlov’s work is that man is an animal and only works through “conditioning”. The Western nations overlooked the fact that this work had already destroyed several countries including Czarist Russia, that Stalin had made Pavlov write up his work in the Kremlin in 1928 in order to permit the control of men. Using the mental studies of an enemy is a very dangerous thing to"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"do. The West at that time was run by only the “very best people” and possibly it pleased them greatly to think that the masses they controlled were only animals after all. That this also made them animals did not occur to them. Billions of dollars were appropriated by parliaments and congress to subsidize men to “better control” their animals. These men had no idea of healing anyone or helping anyone. Riots and civil disorder were the only product they achieved. 394 Dianetics was released straight into the teeth of these heavily subsidized Barons of the Mind with their “it takes 12 years to make a psychiatrist” and “authority states” and “any effort to interrupt this monopoly must be stamped out at once”. Psychology and psychiatry were state (government) subjects, pushed by the “very best people”. They could not make their way on their own because they were contrary to the public morals and customs. The public actually wanted nothing to do with them. In mental institutions torture, permanent damage and death were the order of the day, on the basis that it did not matter if one killed people as they were just animals any way. So the public was on the side of Dianetics (and later Scientology) and the governments were on the side of the “very best people”. Press, controlled by governments and intelligence services and the “very best people” lied endlessly about Dianetics (and Scientology). Dianetics, a new valid mental science, was pitted against Russian and Eastern European teachings. Dianetics is not only the first mental science developed in the West, it is the first mental science on the planet that uniformly produces beneficial results. Man is being subjected to fantastic and violent efforts to lure or crush him into docility. This is the obvious end product of Russian and Eastern European technologies now heavily financed and supported, unwittingly, by Western governments. Man’s response to this is riots and civil disorder in the universities, unions and streets. Man does not accurately trace the source of his oppression. He is violently worried. The government response has been more millions to psychologists and psychiatrists to develop new means of control and oppression. What has not worked in the past is not likely to work in the present or the future. Czarist Russia, the entire Balkans, Poland, Germany and many more Eastern European countries have already perished trying to use the work of Pavlov, Wundt and others. The entire West, having “bought” the same governing ideas, is now in turmoil and is perishing in its turn."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":" Dianetics refuses to be a revolutionary activity. It does not have to be. All it has as a mission is to get itself applied. The basic building block of a society is the individual. From individuals groups are built. And this is the society. No society is better than its basic building blocks. Men are not animals. Well men are sane men. Dianetics, if applied to individuals in the society, brings hope, well and sane beings. 395 These well and sane beings, sent on to Scientology, then become brilliant and very able beings. We are evolving Man to a higher state. In this state he can better handle his problems. We are not trying to overthrow anyone. We are not revolting against anyone. In truth we call even make the fancied “very best people” into actual very best people. Dianetics was first conceived in 1930 and the developments of 39 years have gone into producing Standard Dianetics. Dianetics: The Original Thesis was published in 1949 in manuscript form. It was copied in various ways, hand to hand across the world. Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science was published in late 1949. Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health was published May 9, 1950 and has since sold millions of copies. In the early ‘50s new discoveries concerning the spirit brought us into Scientology. But Dianetics was never lost sight of and every little while I would push it further ahead toward a fast, easy, 100% workability. The present release of Standard Dianetics is a near final product. If done exactly, it produces good, permanent results in only a few hours of auditing. One can train a Dianetic auditor in Standard Dianetics in from 10 days to a month at the most, with an average of about 2 weeks. These are very, very worthwhile advances and Standard Dianetics is almost as great a breakthrough in 1969 as the Original Thesis in 1949. Hundreds of thousands of hours of search and research have gone into it. Dianetics has progressed from the pre- Dianetic period of no science of the mind, to the existence of a real science of the mind, to a fast accurate science simpler than any other scientific subject and of more value to Man. All this advance has been very hardly won, without government billions, in the teeth of avalanches of lies and opposition. The subject owes no allegiance to anyone but itself. It has no commitments to anyone. It has no politics. It belongs to those who use it. It is the only game in the universe where everyone wins. Let’s keep it that way. L.

Newer auditors, not trained in the stern school of running engrams, must learn this all over again. It doesn’t matter whether the auditor has had a policy on this or not- one would think that common decency would be enough as to leave a pc in the middle of a secondary or an engram and just coolly end the session is pretty cruel. Some do it because they are startled or afraid and “Rabbit” (run away by ending the session). Auditors who end a process or change it when it has turned on a heavy somatic are likewise ignorant. WHAT TURNS IT ON WILL TURN IT OFF. This is the oldest rule in auditing. Of course people get into secondaries and engrams, go through misemotion and heavy somatics. This happens because things are running out. To end off a process or a session because of the clock is to ignore the real purpose of auditing. The oldest rules we have are (a) GET THE PC THROUGH IT. (b) WHAT TURNS IT ON WILL TURN IT OFF. (c) THE WAY OUT IS THE WAY THROUGH. These now are expressed as POLICY. 399 A falsified auditor’s report is also subject to a Court of Ethics. Any auditor violating this policy letter is liable to all immediate Court of Ethics convened within 24 hours of the offense or as soon as is urgently possible. Auditing at all levels works well when it is done by the book. The purpose of Ethics is to open the way for all to get in Tech. Then we can do our job. THERE IS NO MODERN PROCESS THAT WILL NOT WORK WHEN EXACTLY APPLIED. Therefore in the eyes of Ethics all auditing failures are Ethics failures- PTS, Suppressive Persons as pcs, or non- compliance with tech for auditors. And the first offense an auditor can commit is ceasing to audit when he is most needed by his pc. Hence it is the first most important consideration of Ethics to prevent such occurrences. Then we’ll make happy pcs, Releases and Clears. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: wmc. pm. cdcn Copyright (c) 1965 by L.

When the term Q and A is used it means one did NOT get an answer to his question. It also means not getting compliance with an order but accepting something else. Example: Auditor: Do birds fly? Pc: I don’t like birds. Auditor: What don’t you like about birds? FLUNK. It’s a Q and A. The right reply would be an answer to the question asked and the right action would be to get the original question answered TR 4 (handling origins) can apply here. The moment TR 4 is violated (Ack and return the pc to original Question) and the original unanswered question is not again asked the Auditor just drifts along with the pc. Things get restimulated, nothing gets really handled or run. In Administration the same thing can happen. The executive gives an order, the junior says or does something else, the executive does not simply TR 4 it and get the original order done, and the result is chaos. Executive: Phone Mr. Schultz and tell him our printing order will be there this afternoon. Junior I don’t know his number. Executive: Don’t you have a phone book? Junior: The phone company didn’t send one this year as our bill was overdue. Executive (the fool) goes to Accounts to see what about the phone bill Mr. Schultz never gets his call. The printing order arrives but Mr. Schultz doesn’t know it . . Example: Executive: Do target 21 now Junior: I don’t have any issue files Executive: What happened to them? Junior Mimeo goofed. Executive: I’ll go see Mimeo . . . DISPERSAL Q and A is simply Postulate Aberration. Aberration is non- straight line by definition. A sick thetan who is all caved in can’t direct a postulate at anything. When he tries, he lets it wobble around and go elsewhere. The difference between a Degraded Being and an is simply that the DB can’t put out a postulate or intention in a direct line or way and make it hold good. The insane are a great example of this. They are insane because they have evil intentions. But they can’t even make these stick. They may intend to burn down the house but they usually wind up watering the rug or do some other non sequitur thing It’s not that they don’t mess things up . 401 The whole point here is that they can’t even properly destroy what they intend to destroy. Even their evil intentions wobble, poor things. But not all people who Q and A are insane. When a person is running at effect he Qs and As. He is confronted by life, he does not confront it. He is usually a bit blind to things as his ability to look AT is turned back on him by his lack of beam power. Thus he gives"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"the appearance of being unaware. His emotional feeling is overwhelm. His mental state is confusion. He starts for B, winds up at- A. Other not too well intentioned people can play tricks on a Qer and Aer. When they don’t want to answer or comply they artfully bring about a Q and A. Example: Bosco does not want to staple the mimeo issue. He knows his senior Qs and As. So we get this. Senior: Staple that issue with the big stapler. Bosco: I hurt my thumb. Q and A Senior: Have you been to see the Medical Officer? Bosco: He wouldn’t look at it. Q and A Senior: I’ll go have a word with him. (Departs.) Bosco gets back to reading “Jesse James Rides Again” humming softly to himself. For HIS trouble is, he Qs and As with the Mest Universe! BODY Q AND A Some people Q and A with their bodies. The body is, after all, composed of Mest. It follows the laws of Mest. One of these laws is Newton’s first law of motion: INERTIA. This is the tendency of a Mest object to remain motionless until acted upon by an exterior force. Or to continue in a line of motion until acted upon by an exterior force. Well, the main force around that is continually acting on a human body is a thetan, the being himself. The body will remain at rest (since it is a Mest Object) until acted upon by the thetan that is supposed to be running it. If that being is an aberrated non- straight line being THE BODY REACTS ON HIM MORE THAN HE REACTS ON THE BODY. Thus he remains motionless or very slow. When the body is in unwanted motion, the being does not deter the motion as the body is acting upon him far more than he is reacting on the body. As a result, one of the manifestations is Q and A. He wants to pick up a piece of paper. The body inertia has to be overcome to do so. So he does not reach for the paper, he just leaves the hand where it is. This would be no action at all. If he then weakly forces the motion, he finds himself picking up something else like a paper clip, decides he wants that anyway and settles for it. Now he has to invent why he has a paper clip in his hand. His original intention never gets executed. Some people on medical lines are just there not because of actual illness but because they are just Qing and Aing with their body. 402 People also Q and A with themselves. They want to stop drinking and can’t. They want to stop or change something about themselves or their body and then disperse off onto something else. Freud read all sorts of dire and awful things into simple Q and A. He invented intentions the person must have that made him “sublimate”. All Freud succeeded in doing was making the person introspective looking for wrong whys. The right why was simple- the person could not go in a straight line to an objective and/ or could not cease to do something he was compulsively doing. The very word ABERRATION contains the idea of this- no straight line but a bent one. "},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"THE CURE FOR THIS SORT OF THING (Q and A with a body) IS OBJECTIVE PROCESSES. And a very willing and bright thetan CAN simply recognize it for what it is- not enough push! And instead of going to the MO for a slight ache, he just pushes on through. As the ache is a recoil of body Q and A in a lot of cases, the ache itself goes away as soon as one simply pushes through. Painters and artists buy the idea they are benefited by aberration. “Be glad you are neurotic” was a trick being played by the late and unlamented psychiatrists on artists. One paints because he can push into execution what he visualizes. The best painters were the least aberrated. Greenwich Village or Left Bank artists, when they don’t paint, never suspect it’s because they just can’t overcome hand inertia to push a paint brush! People live Q and A lives. They never become what they desire to be because they Q and A with life about it. Schopenhauer, the German philosopher of doom, even had a dirty crack about being able to do things: “Stubbornness is the will taking the place of the intellect.” By this, one is “intellectual” if he Qs and As. SUMMARY People who can’t get things done are simply Qing and Aing with people and life. People who CAN get things done just don’t Q and A. All great truths are simple. This is a major one. L.

In Scientologese it is often used to mean “indecisive”, not making up one’s mind. Q stands for “Question”. A stands for “Answer”. In “perfect duplication” the answer to a Question would be the Question. The real definition as it applies to TRs is “The Question proceeding from the last Answer.” Example: Question: How are you? Answer: I’m fine. Question: How fine? Answer: My stomach hurts. Question: When did your stomach begin hurting? Answer: About four. Question: Where were you at four? etc., etc. The above example is a grievous auditing fault. As each question is based on the last answer, it is called “Q and A”. It could also be called “Q based on last A”. It never completes any cycle. It tangles pcs up. It violates TR 3. Don’t do it. I trust the above handles any confusion on this subject.

AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR C/ Ses The responsibility of a Solo Auditor who receives a Case Supervisor direction (C/ S) of what to audit is NOT discharged of his responsibility as an Auditor."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":" THE SOLO AUDITOR HAS A SERIES OF RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE PART OF EVERY C/ S HE GETS TO AUDIT. ACCEPTING A C/ S When the Solo Auditor gets a C/ S to do and he thinks it is not the correct thing to do, he has the right to return it to the C/ S with the reason why and require another one he can agree to. The Auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/ S and change it during the session except as noted below STALE DATED C/ S A C/ S that is a week or two old can be dynamite. This is called a “Stale Dated C/ S” meaning it is too old to be valid. It should have been done sooner. The pc of last week when the C/ S was written may have been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches and reprimand from the body. The Solo Auditor who sees his C/ S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justified in demanding a fresh C/ S giving his reasons why. Use fresh C/ Ses. 406 ENDING THE SESSION When the C/ S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the Solo Auditor has a right to end the session and send the folder to the C/ S. Ending the session is totally up to the Auditor. If the Auditor just doesn’t complete an action that was producing TA and could be completes it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic incident the one more time through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena. This and similar actions would be an Auditor error. The judgment here is whether or not the Auditor’s action is justified in ending the session. Even though he may have made an error, the Auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for the error. AUDITING OVER OUT RUDS Auditing a pc or pre- on something else whose ruds are out is a MAJOR AUDITING ERROR. Even if the C/ S omits “Fly a Rud” or “Fly Ruds” this does not justify the Auditor from auditing the pc over out ruds. The Solo Auditor can do one of two things: He can fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown. INABILITY TO FLY RUDS"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":" If an Auditor cannot get a rud to F/ N, cannot get any rud to F/ N, he is to end the session and send the folder to the C/ S. This is an expected action. It is understood the Auditor would use Suppress and False in trying to fly ruds. SESSIONS FAR APART When a pc has not had a session for some time, or when a pc gets sessions days apart RUDS MUST BE FLOWN. Otherwise the pc will get audited over out- ruds. This can develop mental mass. Optimum session scheduling is a whole Advanced Course done in a block of sessions close together. This prevents the world from throwing the pc’s ruds out between sessions. Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbed in patching life up. Rapid gain gets above life’s annoyances and keeps the pc there. 407 UNREADING ITEMS When an item the Solo Auditor has been told to run doesn’t read on the meter, even when the Auditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the Auditor MUST NOT do anything with the item no matter what the C/ S said. It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it. And if it still doesn’t read he will be expected NOT to run it. HIGH TA When the Auditor sees the TA is high on 2 cans (out of normal range) at session start yet the C/ S says to “Fly a Rud” the AUDITOR MUST NOT TRY TO FLY A RUD. Trying to bring a TA down with ARC brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARC Breaks aren’t the reason TAs go up. Seeing a high TA at start the Solo Auditor does not start the session but sends the folder back to the C/ S. THINGS DONE TWICE By carelessness the same process can be called for twice and done twice or even more. A Folder Summary inside the front cover must exist and must be kept up. Never neglect entering a session and what was run on the Folder Summary (FS). COPYS Don’t copy worksheets from notes. Keep all admin neat and in the original form. Copying makes errors possible. "},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"RUDS GOING OUT When the ruds go out during the session the Solo Auditor recognizes the following; Pc Critical = W/ H from Auditor Pc Antagonistic = BPC in Session No TA = Problem Tired = Failed Purpose or No Sleep Sad = ARC Break Soaring TA = Overrun or Protest Dope Off = By- Passed F/ N or Not Enough Sleep 408 No Interest = Out ruds or No Interest in the First Place A Solo Auditor who isn’t sure what it is but runs into trouble with the pc is smart to end off the session quickly, writs down the full observation and get it to the C/ S. The Solo Auditor who is an old hand and knows what he is looking at as per above scale (and the C/ S the C/ S would give) handles it promptly. Pc Critical = W/ H = pull the W/ H. Pc antagonistic = BPC = assess proper list (such as L1C) and handle. No TA (or case gain) = Problem = locate the problem. Tired = no sleep or failed purpose = check which it is and handle. Sad = ARC Brk = locate and handle, Itsa earlier Itsa. Soaring TA = O/ R or Protest = find which and handle. Such an O/ R is usually by rehab. Dope off = Lack of sleep or BP F/ N = check on sleep, or Rehab F/ N. No Interest = no interest in first place or out ruds = check for interest or put in ruds. Ruds won’t fly = some other error = send to C/ S. The Solo Auditor has no business trying to do the C/ S given when it collides with and isn’t designed to handle any of the above. FALSE REPORTS The vilest trick that can be played on his pc is for a Solo Auditor to falsify an auditing report. "},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"It may be thought to be “good Public Relations” (good PR) for the auditor with the C/ S. Actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk. INTEGRITY is a hallmark of Dianetics and Scientology. Just because psychiatrists were dishonest is no reason for Auditors to be. The results are there to be gotten. False reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the Auditor and pc. “WHAT HE DID WRONG” A Solo Auditor has a right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong. 409 Most often a sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this HCOB have been violated. But an Auditor’s TRs can go out or his handling of the process is in error. Not only does an Auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact HCOB, date and title, that he violated. Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCOB or tape. Don’t be party to a “hidden data line” that doesn’t exist. “You ruined the pc!” is not a valid statement. “You violated HCOB______ page ...” is the charge. No Auditor may be disciplined for asking “May I please have the tape or HCOB that was violated so I can read it or go to Cramming.” If it isn’t on a tape, a book or an HCOB IT IS NOT TRUE and no Auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data. “If it isn’t written it isn’t true” is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech. These are the rights of the Solo Auditor with relation to a C/ S. They are all technical rights based on sound principles. A Solo Auditor should know them and use them. If a Solo Auditor stands on these rights and gets beaten down he should put all the facts before his nearest OTL or SO ship as something would be very wrong somewhere. Solo Auditing is a happy business - when it is done right. L. RON HUBBARD FOUNDER LRH: nt Copyright © 1971, 1975 by L.

This C/ Sing for himself his own next session violates the “continued session rule” wherein an auditor does not “finish” a session by telling the pc “the process will be continued in the next session”. This puts the pc into continued sessions and in Solo can put the PreOT from Solo auditing to self auditing. There is a vast difference between the two. Solo auditing occurs in session with a meter. Self auditing is out of session wondering and chewing on bank. A Solo PreOT must NOT self audit. He ends the session he has done when he ends session on his worksheet. He then goes to Examiner and gets his exam. The Examiner sends the completed Exam form to Solo Admin who puts it in the folder.

The above is the correct C/ Sing line. The worst features of a PreOT doing his own C/ Sing are 1. He is not a trained C/ S. 2.

A PreOT can “rabbit” (run away from the bank) by proposing a C/ S that does not make him confront it. 4.

Setting Up for the Session Prior to the session the auditor is to make sure the room and session are set up, to ensure a smooth session with no interruptions or distractions. Use HCOB 4 December 1977, “Checklist for Setting Up Sessions and An E- Meter,” getting in every point of the checklist. The pc is seated in the chair furthest from the door. From the time he is asked to pick up the cans he remains on the meter until the end of the session. When it is established there is no reason not to begin the session the auditor starts the session. 2. Start of Session The auditor says: “This is the session.” (Tone 40) If the needle is floating and the pc has VGIs, the auditor goes directly into the major action of the session. If not, the auditor must fly a rud. 3. Rudiments Rudiments are handled per HCOB 11 August 1978, Issue I, “Rudiments, Definitions and Patter.” (If the TA is high or low at session start, or if the auditor cannot get a rud to fly, he ends off and sends the pc folder to the C/ S. A Class IV auditor (or above) may do a Green Form or another type of correction list.) When the pc has F/ N, VGIs the auditor goes into the major action of the session. 4. Major Action of the Session "},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"a) R- Factor to the pc.

The commands of the process are cleared per HCOB 9 August 1978 Issue Il, “Clearing Commands.” c) The process. The auditor runs the process or completes the C/ S instructions for the session to end phenomena. In Dianetics, the end phenomena would be: F/ N, erasure of the chain, cognition, postulate (if not voiced in the cognition) and VGIs. In Scientology processes, the end phenomena is: F/ N, cognition, VGIs. The Power Processes have their own EP. 5. Havingness When Havingness is indicated or included in the C/ S instructions, the auditor runs approximately 10 to 12 commands of the pc’s Havingness Process to where the pc is bright, F/ Ning and in PT. (Note: Havingness is never run to obscure or hide the fact of failure to F/ N the main process or an auditing or Confessional question.) (Ref: HCOB 7 August 78, “Havingness, Finding & Running The Pc’s Havingness Process.”) 6. End of Session a) When the auditor is ready to end the session he gives the R- Factor that he will be ending the session. b) Then he asks: “Is there anything you would care to say or ask before I end this session?” Pc answers. Auditor acknowledges and notes down the answer. c) If the pc asks a question, answer it if you can or acknowledge and say, “I will note that down for the C/ S.” d) Auditor ends the session with: “End of session.” (Tone 40.)

There is a wealth of technology and data on these subjects contained throughout the Technical Volumes and in Scientology books which the student auditor will need as he progresses up the levels.) A rudiment is that which is used to get the pc in shape to be audited in that session. For auditing to take place at all the pc must be in session which means: 1. Willing to talk to the auditor 2. Interested in own case. That is all you want to accomplish with rudiments. You want to set up the case to run by getting the rudiments in, not use the rudiments to run the case. ARC breaks, present time problems and withholds all keep a session from occurring. It is elementary auditing knowledge that auditing over the top of an ARC break can reduce a graph, hang the pc up in sessions or worsen his case, and that in the presence of PTPs, overts and missed withholds (a restimulated undisclosed overt) no gains can occur. Thus these are the rudiments we are most concerned with getting in at the beginning of a session so that auditing with gains can occur. GETTING THE F/ N If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release. If a rud doesn’t F/ N then there is an earlier (or an earlier or an earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/ Ning. Thus we have the procedure and the rule: IF A RUD READS YOU ALWAYS TAKE IT EARLIER SIMILAR UNTIL IT F/ Ns. 417 The question used is: “Is there an earlier similar (ARC break) or (problem) or (missed withhold)?” If at the beginning of a session the rudiments are in (the needle is floating and the pc is VGls), the auditor goes directly into the major actions of the session. If not, the auditor must fly a rud or ruds, as ordered by the C/ S. ARC BREAKS ARC: A word from the initial letters of Affinity, Reality and Communication which together equate to Understanding. ARC BREAK: A sudden drop or cutting of one’s affinity, reality or communication with someone or something. Upsets with people or things come about because of a lessening or sundering of affinity, reality, communication or understanding. While the earlier similar rule fully applies to ARC breaks, there is an additional action taken in handling ARC breaks that enables the pc to spot precisely what happened that resulted in the upset. An ARC break is called that- an “A- R- C break”- instead of an upset because, if"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"one discovers which of the three points of understanding have been cut, one can bring about a rapid recovery in the person’s state of mind. You never audit over the top of an ARC break. and you never audit an ARC break itself; they cannot be audited. But they can be assessed to locate which of the basic elements of ARC the charge is on. Thus to handle an ARC break you assess affinity, reality, communication and understanding to find which of these points the break occurred on. Having determined that, you assess the item found (A or R or C or U) against the Expanded CDEI Scale (curious. desired, enforced, inhibited, no and refused). Ref: HCOB 13 Oct 59. DEI EXPANDED SCALE, Scientology 0- 8. The Book of Basics. and HCOB 18 Sep 67, corrected 4.4.74, SCALES. With this assessment the actual bypassed charge can be located and indicated even more accurately, thus enabling the pc to blow it. The assessment is done on every ARC break as you go earlier similar until the rudiment is in with F/ N and VGls. The first rudiment question is: 1. “Do you have an ARC break ?” 2. If there is an ARC break, get the data on it briefly. 3. Find out by assessment which point the ARC break occurred on: “Was that a break in Affinity ? Reality ? Communication ? Understanding ?” 418 You assess it once and get the read (or the largest read) on, say, communication. 4. Check it with the pc: “Was that a break in (communication)? If he says no, rehandle. If yes, let him tell you about it if he wishes. Then give it to him by indicating it, i. e. “I’d like to indicate that was a break in communication.” PROVIDED THE RIGHT ITEM HAS BEEN GOTTEN, the pc will brighten up, even if ever so slightly, on the very first assessment. NOTE: On Step 4 the pc may originate: “Yes, I guess it was communication but to me it’s really more like a break in reality,” for example. The wise auditor then acknowledges and indicates it was a break in “reality. ’’ 5. Taking the item found in Step 4 above, assess it against the CDEI Scale: “Was it: Curious about (communication) ? Desired “ ? Enforced “ ? Inhibited “ ? No “ ? Refused “ ?” 6. As in Steps 3 and 4 above, assess it once. get the item and check it with the pc: “Was it (desired) communication?” If no, rehandle. If yes, indicate it. 7. If no F/ N at this point you follow it earlier with the question: “Is there an earlier similar ARC break?” "},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"8. Get the earlier similar ARC break, get in ARCU, CDEINR, indicate. If no F/N, repeat Step 7, continuing to go earlier, always using ARCU, CDEINR until you get an F/ N. When you get the F/ N and VGls you have it. PRESENT TIME PROBLEM PROBLEM: A conflict arising from two opposing intentions. It’s one thing versus another thing; an intention- counter- intention that worries the preclear. PRESENT TIME PROBLEM: . . . A special problem that exists in the physical universe now, on which the pc has his attention fixed. 419 . . . Any set of circumstances that so engages the attention of the preclear that he feels he should be doing something about it instead of being audited. A violation of “in session- ness” occurs when the pc’s attention is fixed on some concern that is “right now” in the physical universe. The pc’s attention is “over there” not on his case. If the auditor overlooks and doesn’t handle the PTP then the pc is never in session, grows agitated, ARC breaks. And no gains are made because he is not in session. The second rudiment question is: 1. “Do you have a present time problem?” 2. If there is a PTP, have the pc tell you about it. 3. If no F/ N take it earlier with the question: “Is there an earlier similar problem?” 4. Get the earlier problem and if no F/ N, follow it earlier similar, earlier similar, earlier similar to F/ N. MISSED WITHHOLDS OVERT ACT: An intentionally committed harmful act committed in an effort to solve a problem. . . . an act of omission or commission which does the least good for the least number of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics. That thing which you do which you aren’t willing to have happen to you. WITHHOLD: An undisclosed harmful (contra- survival) act. Something the pc did that he isn’t talking about. MISSED WITHHOLD: An undisclosed contra- survival act which has been restimulated by another but not disclosed. This is a withhold which another person nearly found out about, leaving the person with the withhold in a state of wondering whether his hidden deed is known or not. The pc with a missed withhold will not be honestly “willing to talk to the auditor” and, therefore, not in session until the missed withhold is pulled. "},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"Missing a withhold or not getting all of it is the sole source of an ARC break. A missed withhold is observable by any of the following: pc not making progress, pc critical of, nattery or angry at the auditor, refusing to talk to the auditor, not desirous of being audited, boiling off, exhausted, foggy at session end, dropped havingness, telling others the auditor is no good, demanding redress of wrongs, critical of Scientology or organizations or people of Scientology, lack of auditing results, dissemination failures. (Ref: 420 HCOB 3 May 62, ARC BREAKS, MISSED WITHHOLDS.) The auditor must not overlook any manifestations of a missed withhold. Thus, if the pc has a missed withhold you get it, get all of it using the system described below, and use the same system on each earlier similar missed withhold until you get the F/ N. The third rudiment question is: 1. “Has a withhold been missed?” 2. If you get a missed withhold, find out: (a) What was it? (b) When was it? (c) Is that all of the withhold? (d) WHO missed it? (e) What did (he/ she) do to make you wonder whether or not (he/ she) knew? (f) Who else missed it? (Repeat (e) above). Get another and another who missed it, using the Suppress button as necessary, and repeating (e) above. 3. Clean it to F/ N, or if no F/ N take it earlier similar with the question: “Is there an earlier similar missed withhold?” 4. Handle each earlier similar missed withhold you get per Step 2 above, until you get an F/ N. SUPPRESS If a rudiment doesn’t read and is not F/ Ning, put in the Suppress button, using: “On the question ‘Do you have an ARC break? ’ has anything been suppressed?” If it reads, take it and ask ARCU, CDEINR, earlier similar, etc. Use Suppress in the same way for non- reading PTP and missed withhold rudiments. FALSE If the pc protests, comments. or seems bewildered put in the False button.

These steps now become THE way to clear a withhold or missed withhold. AUDITOR OBJECTIVE The Auditor’s object is to get the pc to look so that the pc can tell the auditor. The auditor’s objective is not to get the pc to tell the auditor. If the pc is in session the pc will talk to the auditor. If the pc is not in session, the pc won’t tell the auditor a withhold. I never have any trouble getting the pc to tell me a withhold. I sometimes have trouble getting the pc to find out about a withhold so the pc can tell it to me. If the pc will not tell the auditor a withhold (and the pc knows it)"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"the remedy is rudiments. I always assume, and correctly, that if the pc knows about it the pc will tell me. My job is to get the pc to find out so the pc has something to tell me. The chief auditor blunder in pulling withholds stems from the auditor assuming the pc already knows when the pc does not. If used exactly, this system will let the pc find out and let the pc get all the charge off of a withhold as well as tell the auditor all about it. Missing a withhold or not getting all of it is the sole source of ARC break. Get a reality on this now. All trouble you have or have ever had or will ever have with ARC breaky pcs stems only and wholly from having restimulated a withhold and yet having failed to pull it. The pc never forgives this. This system steers you around the rock of missed withholds and their bombastic consequences. WITHHOLD SYSTEM This system has five parts: 0. The Difficulty being handled. 1. What the withhold is. 2. When the withhold occurred. 423 3. All of the withhold. 4. Who should have known about it. Numbers (2) (3) and (4) are repeated over and over, each time testing (1) until (1) no longer reacts. (2) (3) and (4) clear (1). ( 1) straightens out in part (0). (0) is cleaned up by finding many (1) ’s and (1) is straightened up by running (2) (3) and (4) many times. These steps are called (0) Difficulty, (1) What (2) When (3) All (4) Who. The auditor must memorize these as What, When, All and Who. The order is never varied. The questions are asked one after the other. None of them are repetitive questions. USE A MARK IV The whole operation is done on a Mark IV. Use no other meter as other meters may read right electronically without reading mental reactions well enough. Do this whole system and all questions at sensitivity 16. THE QUESTIONS 0. The suitable question concerning the Difficulty the pc is having. Meter reads. 1. What. “What are you withholding about ...............?” (the Difficulty) (or as given in future issues). Meter reads. Pc answers with a w/ h, large or small. 2. When. “When did that occur?” or “When did that happen?” or “What was the time of that?” Meter reads. Auditor can date in a generality or precisely on meter. A generality is best at first, a precise dating on the meter is used later in this sequence on the same w/ h."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":" 3. All. “Is that all of that?” Meter reads. Pc answers. 4. Who. “Who should have known about that?” or “Who didn’t find out about that?” Meter reads. Pc answers. Now test (1) with the same question that got a read the first time. (The question for (1) is never varied on the same w/ h.) 424 If needle still reads ask (2) again, then (3), then (4), getting as much data as possible on each. Then test (1) again. (1) is only tested, never worked over except by using (2), (3) and (4). Continue this rotation until (I) clears on needle and thus no longer reacts on a test. Treat every withhold you find (or have found) in this fashion always. SUMMARY You are looking at a preview of PREPARATORY TO CLEARING. “Prepclearing” for short. Abandon all further reference to security checking or sec checking. The task of the auditor in Prepclearing is to prepare a pc’s rudiments so that they can’t go out during 3D Criss Cross. The value of Prepclearing in case gain, is greater than any previous Class I or Class II auditing. We have just risen well above Security Checking in ease of auditing and in case gains. You will shortly have the ten Prepclearing lists which give you the (0) and (1) questions. Meanwhile, treat every withhold you find in the above fashion for the sake of the preclear, for your sake as an auditor and for the sake of the good name of Scientology. (Note: To practice with this system, take a withhold a pc has given several times to you or you and other auditors. Treat the question that originally got it as (I) and clean it as above in this system. You will be amazed.) L. RON HUBBARD LRH: sf. cden Copyright ©1962 by L.

Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 427 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 27 MAY 1970R REVISED 3 DECEMBER 1978 Remimeo (Revisions in this type style) UNREADING QUESTIONS AND ITEMS Reference: HCOB 3 Dec 78 UNREADING FLOWS Never list a listing question that doesn’t read. Never prepcheck an item that doesn’t read. These rules hold good for all lists, all items, all flows, including Dianetics. A “tick” or a “stop” is not a read. Reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fall blowdown (of TA). A preclear’s case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing a list that doesn’t read or prepchecking an item that doesn’t read or running an item or flow that doesn’t read. On a list, this is the sort of thing that happens: The list is “Who or what would fly kites?” The C/ S has said to “List this to a BD F/ N item.” So the auditor does list it without checking the read at all. The list can go on 99 pages with the pc protesting, getting upset. This is called a “Dead horse list” because it gave no item. The reason it didn’t was that the list question itself didn’t read. One does an L4BRA on the pc to correct the situation and gets “unnecessary action.” On a list that is getting no item you don’t extend. You correctly use L4BRA or any subsequent issue of it. If you extend a “dead horse list” you just make things worse. Use an L4BRA and it will set it right. This weird thing can also happen. C/ S says to list “Who or what would kill buffaloes?” The auditor does, gets a BD F/ N item “A hunter.” The C/ S also says to list as a second action “Who or what would feel tough?” The auditor fails to test the question for read and lists it. Had he tested it, the list would not have read. But the list comes up with an item, “A mean hunter.” It has stirred up charge from the first question and the item “A mean hunter” is a wrong item as it is a misworded variation of the first list’s item! Now we have an unnecessary action and"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"a wrong item. We do an L4BRA and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the two errors read. In a Dianetic “list” one is not doing a listing action. One is only trying to find a somatic or sensation, etc. that will run. The item must read well. Or it won’t produce a chain to run. In actual fact the Dn list Q does usually read but one doesn’t bother to test it. 428 But an item or flow that doesn’t read will produce no chain, no basic and the pc will jump around the track trying but just jamming up his bank. _____________ The moral of this story is: ALWAYS TEST A LISTING QUESTION BEFORE LETTING THE PC LIST. ALWAYS MARK THE READ IT GAVE (SF, F, LF, LFBD) ON THE WORKSHEET . ALWAYS TEST AN ITEM FOR READ BEFORE PREPCHECKING AND ALWAYS CHECK AN ITEM AND FLOW BEFORE RUNNING RECALLS OR ENGRAMS . ALWAYS MARK THE READ AN ITEM GAVE (SF, F, LF, LFBD) ON THE WORKSHEET. CHARGE The whole subject of “charge” is based on this. “Charge” is the electrical impulse on the case that activates the meter. “Charge” shows not only that an area has something in it. It also shows that the pc has possible reality on it. A pc can have a broken leg, yet it might not read on a meter. It would be charged but below the pc’s reality. So it won’t read. THINGS THAT DON’T READ WON’T RUN. The Case Supervisor always counts on the AUDITOR to test questions and items and flows for read before running them. The auditor, when a question or item or flow doesn’t read, can and should always put in “Suppress” and “Invalidate.” “On this (question) (item) (flow), has anything been suppressed?” “On this (question) (item) (flow), has anything been invalidated?” If either one read, the question or item or flow will also read. The Case Supervisor also counts on the AUDITOR to use Suppress and Invalidate on a question or item or flow. If after this there is still no read on the question or item or flow, that’s it. Don’t use it, don’t list it. Go to the next action on the C/ S or end off. LRH: dz. ka. rd. jk L. RON HUBBARD Copyright © 1970, 1978 Founder by L.

Remimeo All Levels"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":" F/ N EVERYTHING Whenever an auditor gets a read on an item from Ruds or a prepared list (L1B, L3A, L4B, etc., etc.) IT MUST BE CARRIED TO AN F/ N. To fail to do so is to leave the pc with by- passed charge. When a pc has had several reads on various lists which were none of them carried to F/ N, it can occur that he will become upset or depressed without any other apparent reason. As one has DONE the lists without F/ Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong? The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not carried to F/ N. This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth and indeed makes it Flag Auditing. When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible. Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared list would F/ N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn’t F/ N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier or an earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/ Ning. So the RULE: NEVER WALK OFF FROM A READING ITEM ON A RUDIMENT OR A PREPARED REPAIR LIST BEFORE YOU CARRY IT DOWN (EARLIER SIMILAR) TO AN F/ N. Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/ N, Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc. until he gets an F/ N. Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/ S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/ Ns. Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/ N. Is there an earlier similar denied item? Answered. F/ N. Go on to next reading item on the list. Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/ S must take every item on it that read, by 2wc or other process, to an F/ N. 430 So there is a much more general rule: EVERY ITEM THAT READS MUST F/ N. In Dianetics you get the F/ N when you run E/ S secondaries or engrams to an erasure, F/ N, Cog, VGIs. In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/ S to F/ N. On a prepared list you take each read to an F/ N or E/ S to F/ N. On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/ N. On GF you get by whatever process an F/ N. On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/ N. So another rule: EVERY MAJOR AND MINOR ACTION MUST BE CARRIED TO AN F/ N. There are NO exceptions. Any exception leaves by- passed charge on the pc. Also, every F/ N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained. You take too soon an F/ N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by- passed charge (a withheld cognition). _____________"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":" I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items and then audit the pc and carry each one to F/ N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up with a very shining, cool calm pc. So “Have reading items been left charged?” would be a key question on a case. _____________ Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will get you reading items that won’t F/ N. So, another rule: NEVER TRY TO FLY RUDS OR DO L1B ON A HIGH OR LOW TA. One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down). 431 Or one can assess L4B. About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi- Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71 and possibly a GF+ 40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdown on it and can possibly be brought to F/ N. If this occurs then one also handles all other items that read. _____________ The most frequent errors in all this are: Not taking a read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as “clean”. Not using suppress and false on items. And of course leaving a pc thinking things are still charged by failing to indicate the F/ N. Indicating an F/ N before Cog. Not going back through the folder to handle ruds and items that read but were called “clean” or were simply abandoned. A pc audited under tension of poor TRs has a hard time and does not F/ N sometimes, inviting overrun. The rules then to happy pcs are: GOOD TRs. F/ N EVERYTHING FOUND ON RUDS AND LISTS. AUDIT WITH TA IN NORMAL RANGE OR REPAIR IT SO IT IS IN NORMAL RANGE. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH: mes. nt. rd Copyright © 1971, 1973 by L.

Watch the distance the needle drops. If the distance the needle fell is less than one- third of a dial drop, raise the sensitivity some and get another can squeeze, continuing this procedure till you’ve got the sensitivity setting that gives you one third dial drop on the can squeeze. If the can squeeze gave you more than one- third dial drop at Sens. 5, lower the sensitivity setting a bit, test another can squeeze, continuing this procedure till you get one- third of a dial drop. In other words, keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher according to whether the drop is more or less than one- third of a dial drop, until you get the correct sensitivity setting.” Page 13, Section 7: Delete. “Adjust the knob to a still needle that will yet move on needed responses.” Add: “Adjust the sensitivity knob to get a third of a dial drop on the can squeeze, or as close to that as you can.” The whole section now reads: “In short, adjust the sensitivity knob to get a third of a dial drop on the can squeeze, or as close to that as you can.” RE: THE NEEDLE: Page 14.

The needle ‘goes crazy’, slamming back and forth, narrowly, widely, over on the left, over on the right, in a mad war dance or as if it were frantically trying to escape. It means hot terminal or hot anything in an assessment and takes precedence over a fall.” The entire section is replaced with: “A Rock Slam is a crazy, irregular, left right slashing motion of the needle. It repeats left and right slashes unevenly and savagely, faster than the eye easily follows. The needle is frantic. The width of a Rock Slam (R/ S) depends largely on sensitivity setting. It goes from one- fourth inch to whole dial. But it slams back and forth. It means hot item in an assessment and takes precedence over a fall or it means that you have left rings on the pc’s hands or have a loose connection in the leads or meter.

The entire section now reads: “One exception: The British and American Hubbard Electrometer early models including the Mark V until February 1979 had a ‘carbon pot’ which is to say the Tone Arm was in ‘pure carbon bearings’, if you could call it that. A speck of dust can get in the ‘pot’ and cause the needle to rock slam whether connected to the preclear or not. Pull the lead wire jack (disconnecting cans) and if the slam continues, it’s the ‘pot’ that’s wrong. Work the Tone Arm vigorously for a short while. If that doesn’t stop it, turn it in to be repaired. Later models of the British and American Hubbard Electrometer have ‘wire wound pots’ and this doesn’t happen . “ L.

NUMBER: EM- 5RA NAME: CAN SQUEEZE PURPOSE: "},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"I. To demonstrate to the student how an incorrect can squeeze gives an inaccurate, unreliable needle reaction. II. To train a student auditor how to get a pc to do an accurate can squeeze. III. To train a student auditor how to determine the sensitivity setting to get 1/ 3 of a dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze, for use in setting the correct sensitivity for each preclear in an auditing session. IV. To convince a student auditor that he has to use a correct sensitivity setting for 1/ 3 of a dial drop of the can squeeze to have a workable and readable E- Meter. POSITION: The coach and the student auditor sit facing each other across a table with an E- Meter facing the student auditor. The E- Meter is already set up. TRAINING STRESS: SECTION 1: To give the student auditor a reality on how a can squeeze can be done incorrectly. so he will know all the points he may have to correct to ensure he gets an accurate can squeeze. 1. Coach picks up the cans and holds his hands on the table so the student can clearly see them. 440 2. Coach has student set sensitivity booster knob to lowest position and the sensitivity at 1 on the sensitivity knob. 3. Coach has student adjust the needle to the set line on the needle dial. The coach will have the student readjust the needle to set as necessary as the beginning of each demonstration of the can squeeze. 4. The coach gives the cans a squeeze with an even pressure. If there is no read or a very small one, less than an inch, at sensitivity 1, the student auditor moves the sensitivity knob to 5, and gets another can squeeze. If still no read or it’s smaller than an inch, student moves sensitivity to 16 and gets another squeeze. For purposes of the following demonstration, you want to set the sensitivity so that you can obviously see a movement of the needle on the can squeeze of about an inch. So the sensitivity could be set lower than 5 or higher than 5, so long as you get a fall of about an inch on the squeeze. 5. With the sensitivity setting determined in 4 above, the coach will then squeeze the cans incorrectly, each time in a different way. The coach shows the student what particular thing he’s doing with his hands, and then has the student observe what happens on the meter and the distance the needle falls on the dial when he does each version of an incorrect can squeeze as follows: A. Coach holds the cans with cups of palms and all fingers and both thumbs in complete contact with the cans. As he squeezes the cans, he lifts one finger off and then puts the finger back on after relaxing the squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. B. Coach holds the cans as in A. This time he gives the cans a very fast light squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. "},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"C. Coach holds the cans as in A, squeezes them with a gradual pressure and then when he releases the squeeze he relaxes his grip on the cans so it is much looser than before the can squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. D. Coach holds the cans as in A, and this time gives a hard fast squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. E. Coach holds the cans as in A, squeezes them firmly and only partially releases the squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. F. Coach holds the cans as in A, but gives a squeeze in 2 stages, first a little squeeze, then suddenly a harder one. This is an incorrect can squeeze. G. Coach holds the cans as in A, gives a hard fast squeeze, and holds the grip. The student should notice that the needle swings way over to the right due to the sudden motion, and that it returns only part of the way with the coach still maintaining the squeeze, thus giving an incorrect measurement of the can squeeze. Student should see that the distance between the first needle position at set and the final needle position with the coach still maintaining the squeeze is the actual measurement of the can squeeze fall. It is not the distance between the first needle position of set and the needle position at the far swing to the right. A hard, fast can squeeze is an incorrect can squeeze. 441 H. Coach holds the cans so they are not in contact with the cups of his palms and squeezes them. This is an incorrect can squeeze. I. Coach holds the cans with the thumbs going up the sides and sticking out over the top edge of the cans and squeezes them. This is an incorrect can squeeze. J. Coach holds the cans in a fairly tight grip and squeezes the cans. This is an incorrect can squeeze. K. Coach holds the cans with the forefingers lifted slightly off and puts the forefingers on the cans during the squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. The drill is continued until the student auditor gets the idea that an incorrect can squeeze gives inaccurate, unreliable needle reactions. SECTION II: To give the student auditor a proper idea as to what a correct can squeeze is, and to train him how to get a correct can squeeze. 1. The following drill should be done first by the coach to demonstrate to the student auditor what a correct can squeeze is: A. The coach has the student auditor shake his hands until the fingers are loose and floppy. B. Then the coach has the student auditor put his hands on the table, palms up, exerting no control on his fingers. The student auditor’s fingers will curl in toward the palm. C. Now the coach simply places the cans in the student auditor’s hands at an angle across the palms. The natural curl of the fingers is sufficient to hold the cans in place, and the placement of the cans at an angle ensures that the maximum skin area is touching the cans. The cups of the student auditor’s palms and all the fingers"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"and both thumbs must be touching the cans. Ensure the thumbs go around the cans and not up the sides. D. Now the coach has the student auditor gradually increase the pressure of his grip on the cans until a light squeeze is achieved, and then relax it. This is a correct can squeeze. E. NOTE: Ensure when the student auditor relaxes his grip that he does not take a finger or thumb or his palms off the cans. He should have about the same contact he had at the start as in C above. 2. Having done the above, the coach now has the student auditor do the drill as follows: A. Have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze. B. Check the coach’s grip on the cans to ensure it is correct as in B and C above. The student may have to try out different sizes of cans, small, medium or large, depending on the size of the coach’s hands, to obtain the correct size can which he can hold comfortably without strain and that fits into the cup of his palm, with maximum skin contact. 442 C. Adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position. D. (a) Set the sensitivity knob at I on the sensitivity dial. (b) Adjust the needle to the set line on the needle dial. (c) Give the proper commands for getting a can squeeze as follows: “Squeeze the cans, please.” “Thank you.” The student must ensure the coach gradually increases the pressure of his grip on the cans and relaxes it. (d) Note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans. E. Now increase the sensitivity setting to 2 and repeat steps D (b), (c) and (d) above, again noting the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans. F. Repeat steps D (b), (c) and (d) for sensitivity setting at 3, then sensitivity setting 4, then 5, then 6, and on up until you have the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze. With the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze, you wouldn’t be able to note the length of the needle fall. Flunks are given for not having the coach remove all rings or finger jewelry, as they can cause the needle to give unusual reads; for not checking that there is maximum skin contact on the cans; for failing to see that the thumbs go around the can and not up the sides; for failing to set the meter and needle up properly; for failing to notice and handle a sudden or hard or jerky or convulsive can squeeze instead of an even increase of pressure on the cans or sudden letting go of the cans; for not making sure the coach doesn’t take a finger or thumb or palm off the cans when he releases the contact; for failing to note accurately the distance the needle fell on the can squeeze; and for giving the wrong commands. Lack of skill in earlier drills is corrected by pink sheet. "},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"SECTION III: To give the student auditor a reality on setting the sensitivity for a 1/ 3 of a dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze. The student auditor should know that setting the sensitivity for 1/ 3 of a dial drop on the can squeeze is an integral part of setting up each and every session he does. It is the sensitivity he will be using during the session. It is vitally important he gets the correct sensitivity setting for each preclear at each session, so that he will not miss reads or F/ Ns. A sensitivity setting which is too low or too high for that particular preclear in the particular session will obscure reads and F/ Ns, thus upsetting the preclear’s case. Therefore, the student auditor must be proficient on this drill. 1. A. Have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze. B. Check the coach’s grip to ensure it is correct, also ensuring you have the correct can size. 443 C. Adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position. D. (a) Set the sensitivity knob at 5 on the sensitivity dial. (b) Adjust the needle to set line on the dial. (c) Get the coach to squeeze the cans ensuring he does it properly. (d) Note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans. E. On Step D (d) the needle will have fallen a distance of either (a) LESS than 1/ 3 of a dial drop, or (b) MORE than 1/ 3 of a dial drop. If it’s (a) raise the sensitivity a bit and repeat steps D (b), (c) and (d) and continue to do this until you have 1/ 3 dial drop. If it’s (b) lower the sensitivity a bit and repeat steps D (b), (c) and (d) and continue to do this until you have 1/ 3 dial drop. In other words, keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher according to whether the drop is more or less than 1/ 3 of a dial drop, until you get the correct sensitivity setting. Each time a new can squeeze is asked for, the student auditor is to make sure the coach is holding the cans properly and is giving a correct can squeeze. F. The student then notes the exact sensitivity setting at which he got the 1/ 3 dial drop. Flunks are given for errors as in Section II above and for failing to recognize when a 1/ 3 dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze has been obtained; for failing to recognize if the coach is giving a considerably harder or lighter can squeeze than he was giving at sensitivity 5, and for failing to establish the correct sensitivity setting for 1/ 3 of a dial drop on the coach. "},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"2. Now the coach has the student auditor do the drill on a number of other students, with the coach watching, until he is satisfied that the student can easily and accurately establish the correct sensitivity setting for a 1/ 3 dial drop can squeeze. SECTION IV: To give the student auditor a reality on how a correct sensitivity setting for 1/ 3 of a dial drop on the can squeeze gives a readable and workable meter and how an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter, so the student will understand why he has to use a sensitivity setting that gives 1/ 3 of a dial drop. 1. Coach has the student auditor set the sensitivity accurately on a correct can squeeze for 1/ 3 dial drop as in Section III. 2. The student auditor does a “pinch test” as follows: student pinches the coach’s arm, hard enough to hurt a little bit. 3. Now, while watching the meter, the student says to the coach: 444 “Recall that pinch I just gave you.” “Thank you.” 4. Student notes the reaction of the needle to his command and the distance the needle fell. 5. Coach has the student do steps 2, 3, and 4 several times, each time noting what the needle does in response to “Recall that pinch.” 6. Coach now has the student set the sensitivity at 1. Student has coach squeeze the cans and notes whether there’s a read, or not. If there is a read, note size of read and leave the sensitivity at 1. If there’s no read on the squeeze, the student still leaves the sensitivity at 1. 7. The student auditor does a new “pinch test” as in 2, 3, 4 and 5 above, noting the difference in needle response to the command “Recall that pinch” as compared to what it was in Step 5 at the correct sensitivity setting. There may be no read at all and the student should notice that. 8. Coach now has student set the sensitivity at 32, and coach squeezes the cans. 9. Student does the pinch test again and notes the reaction of the needle to his command “Recall that pinch.” 10. Coach has the student then set the sensitivity correctly for 1/ 3 of a dial drop on a correct can squeeze and does the pinch test again. 11. The student should observe from these pinch tests that an accurate sensitivity setting determined from a correct can squeeze gives a readable and workable meter and that an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter. If he does not see this clearly, then the coach would have the student redo steps 7 through 10 until the student sees why the sensitivity must be set for 1/ 3 of a dial drop determined by a correct can squeeze.

It need only be done once unless the check itself is suspected false, or if conditions of the pc’s hands, etc., change. “The checklist is kept in the pc folder and is entered on the Folder Summary as an action done. “The value of operating with correct can size should not be underestimated, the reference HCOBs state why.” The auditor signs and answers the following points on the checklist. The auditor must obtain information by checking the pc’s hands himself or herself to see if the hands are dry or wet. The cause of false TA is in the physical universe and that is where the check is done. It is not done by asking the pc or checking the questions on the pc for meter reads. So the auditor would feel the hands of the pc to establish if they are dry or wet, would feel the pc’s hands with cream on them to see if the cream has dried up, would see if the pc’s hands cup so as to form an area that does not touch the cans and so forth. False TA is not think or mental mass. It is in the physical universe and that is where it has to be handled for it to be remedied. The handling follows each line as you check it. This is for simplicity, as that is the way this checklist is done, each line being handled as you go. R- FACTOR TO PC: “I AM GOING TO CHECK THE CANS, YOUR HANDS AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS TO ADJUST EVERYTHING FOR BEST ACCURACY” FALSE TA CHECKLIST AND HANDLING SHEET 1. IS THE METER FULLY CHARGED? ________ Handling: “Keep a meter charged at least one hour for every 10 of auditing for 240 AC volt charging current, or 2 hrs. for every 10 of auditing on a 110 AC volt charging current. (Mark VI will get about 6 hrs. for every 1 hr. charged.) “Before each session snap the knob over to TEST. The needle should hit hard on the right side of the face. It can even bounce. If the needle doesn’t snap to the right hard or if it doesn’t quite get there on TEST, then that meter will go flat in mid- session and give false TA and no reads or TA on hot subjects.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA, False TA) NOTE: To ensure an accurate check, the meter should be turned on a minute or two before turning to test. "},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"2. IS THE METER TRIMMED CORRECTLY? ________ 447 Handling: “A meter can be improperly trimmed (not set at 2.0 with the trim knob) and can give a false TA position. When a meter is not left on a minute or two before trimming, it can drift in the session and give a slightly false TA. “The trim can quietly be checked in mid- session by snapping out the jack where the cord goes into the box and putting the TA on 2, seeing if the needle is now on SET. If not, the trim knob can be moved to adjust it. The jack is quietly slipped back in. All without distracting the pc.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA, False TA) 3. ARE THE LEADS CONNECTED TO THE METER AND CANS? ________ Handling: “A properly set up meter with cans (electrodes) fitted to a pc who is holding them properly IS ALWAYS CORRECT.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 1971A) Reference for setting up a meter is covered in E- Meter Drills book, EM 4, and the Mark VI owner’s manual if one is using a Mark VI. 4. ARE THE CANS RUSTY? ________ Handling: “Corroded cans can falsify TA. Get new ones now and then.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71A) 5. ARE PC’S HANDS EXCESSIVELY DRY REQUIRING HAND CREAM? ________ Handling: “A quick test is have the pc put the cans under his armpits and you’ll see if it’s his callused or chemically dried out hands. The excessively dry hand is seen as shiny or polished looking. It feels very dry. The correct treatment is to use a hand cream, but not a greasy hand cream or vanishing cream. A good hand cream rubs all the way into the hand and leaves no excess grease. Hand cream is usually smeared on, rubbed in and can then be thoroughly wiped off. The hands will usually produce, then, a normal TA and meter response.” LRH (HCOB 23 Nov 73RB Re- revised 25 May 1980, Dry and Wet Hands Make False TA) 6. ARE THE PC’S HANDS EXCESSIVELY WET REQUIRING POWDER? ________ Handling: “If the TA is low, check if the pc’s hands are wet. If so have him wipe them and get a new read. It is usually found that the 1.6 was really 2.0.... Have the pc wipe hands.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) “Antiperspirants can be applied to too wet hands. There are many brands of these, often a powder or spray. It can be wiped off after application and should work for two to three hours.” LRH (HCOB 23 Nov 73RB) 448 7. THE PC IS NOT BEING TOLD CONTINUALLY TO WIPE HIS HANDS? ________ Handling: Above per wet hands. 8. THE PC’S GRIP ON THE CANS IS NOT BEING CONTINUALLY CHECKED BY THE AUDITOR IN A WAY THAT INTERRUPTS THE PC? ________ "},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"Handling: “Keep the pc’s hands in sight. Check the pc’s grip. Get smaller cans.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) 8A. IS THE PC USING THE WRONG TYPE OF CANS? ________ a) corrugated ________ b) cellophane bonded to metal ________ c) wrong metal ________ The right metal is tin- plated steel, not cellophane bonded or painted. Handling: Replace with the correct cans. “Cans of course should be STEEL with a thin tin plating.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) 8B. ARE THE CANS TOO SHORT FOR THE PC’S HANDS TO COVER? ________ Handling: Replace with cans of correct length so that the whole hand has contact with the can. (Ref. HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) 9. TA POSITION FOR LARGE CANS? ________ Size approx 41/ 2 inches by 3 inches or 11 cm by 8 cm Handling: “For a normal or large handed pc the can size is about 4” inches by 2 5/ 8 inches or 12% cm by 7 cm. This can be altered as big as 4 1/ 2 inches by 3 inches diameter or 11 cm by 8 cm. This is standard.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71 A) 449 10. TA POSITION ON MEDIUM CANS? ________ Size approx 47/ 8 inches by 25/ 8 inches or 12l/ 2 cm by 7 cm Handling: Covered above. 11. TA POSITION ON SMALL CANS? ________ Size approx 33/ 4 inches by 21/ 8 inches or 9cm by 5cm Handling: “This can should be 3 3/ 4 inches by 2 1/ 8 inches or 9 cm by 5 cm diameter or thereabouts. A small child would be lost even with that can. So a small 35 mm film can could be used. This is 2 inches long by 1 3/ 16 diameter or 5 cm by 3 cm. This works but watch it as these cans are aluminum. They do work but test for true read with a slightly larger can and then trim to adjust for the aluminum if any different. “Cans of course should be STEEL with a thin tin plating. Regular soup cans. Can size to match the pc avoids slack can grip or tiring the hands into going slack, giving the auditor 3.2 F/ Ns and trouble.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) 11A. CAN SIZE FOR A CHILD IS INCORRECT? ________ Handling: Size can go down to photographic aluminum 35 mm film cans for a child. Size approx 2 inches by 13/ l6 inches or 5 cm by 3 cm. Note down TA position. 11B. IF THE ABOVE MENTIONED CAN SIZES AREN’T CORRECT FOR THE PC’S HANDS OTHER SIZES CAN BE TRIED. ________ "},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Handling: 1 1/ 4” tubing or 1 3/ 4” tubing as well as other can size checked to see which fits the pc’s hand. Note TA position. 12. ARE THE CANS TOO LARGE FOR THE PC? ________ Handling: “Can size to match the pc avoids slack can grip or tiring the hands into going slack.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71A) Check the pc’s grip and see if the hand is touching all of the can and if the size is comfortable. (Ref. HCOB 13 Jan 77RB, Handling a False TA) 13. ARE THE CANS TOO SMALL FOR THE PC? ________ 450 Handling: Per above. Check how the pc is holding the cans and if the entire hand is on the cans and if they are comfortable and adjust accordingly per above. 14. ARE THE CANS JUST RIGHT FOR THE PC? ________ Handling: Check the grip and see if the can size is correct for the pc. Do the cans comfortably fit the pc’s hands with the hand touching the cans so it gets an accurate reading on the meter? If the can size is correct then you must ensure that the grip is also correct on the cans. 15. ARE THE CANS COLD? ________ Handling: “Regardless of can size, cold E- Meter electrodes tend to give a much higher tone arm reading particularly on some pcs. “Until the cans warm up, the reading is generally false and is false in the direction of high. Some pcs are ‘cool blooded’ and the shock of ice- cold cans can drive the TA up and it takes a while to drift down. “A practice which gets around this is for the auditor or Examiner to hold the cans briefly until they are warm and then give them to the pc. A variation is for the auditor or Examiner to put the cans under his armpits while setting up. This warms them. There are probably many other ways to warm up cans to body temperature.” LRH (HCOB 12 Nov 71RB) 15A. DID THE PC WASH HIS HANDS JUST BEFORE SESSION? ________ Handling: Use a bit of hand cream to bring hands back to normal amount of moisture. 16. ARE THE PC’S HANDS DRY OR CALLUSED? Handling: Covered above under pc’s hands excessively dry requiring hand cream. There are ways to apply the hand cream so that it is correct for that individual pc and does handle the false TA. You can spread it on extensively then wipe it off and then rub a bit more in ensuring the thumbs are included is one way. (Ref. HCOB 13 Jan 77RB) The point is to feel the hands with the cream on them to see if it has handled the excessively dry hand that is seen as shiny or polished looking. "},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"And it now should no longer feel dry. (HCOB 23 Nov 73RB Re- revised 25 May 80) The correct treatment is to use a hand cream but not greasy hand cream or vanishing cream. A good hand cream rubs all the way into the skin and leaves no excess grease. This restores normal electrical contact. Such a hand cream would only have to be applied once per session- at session start- as it lasts for a long while. 451 If a cream leaves smears on a can, it is too heavily applied or too little absorbed. (HCOB 23 Apr 75A Re- revised 25 May 80) 17. DOES THE PC HAVE ARTHRITIC HANDS? ________ Handling: “A rare pc is so crippled with arthritis that he doesn’t make contact fully with the cans. This gives high TA. Use wide wrist straps and you’ll get a right read.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA Re- revised 25 May 80) 18. DOES THE PC LOOSEN HIS GRIP ON THE CANS? ________ Handling: Check the grip. Does the angle of the cans go across the palms of the pc? Is the natural curl of the fingers sufficient to hold the cans in place, and is the placement of the cans at an angle ensuring that the maximum skin area is touching the cans? (Ref. BOOK OF EMETER DRILLS) See if the palm is touching the can and not elevated off. (Ref. HCOB 13 Jan 77RB) 19. CHECK THE PC’S GRIP, DOES HE HOLD THE CANS CORRECTLY? ________ Handling: Covered in above section. Also check to see if the pc is holding the cans so tight that it is causing the hands to sweat and read falsely low. (Ref. HCOB 13 Jan 77RB and HCOB 7 Feb 79R, E- Meter Drill 5RA) 20. IS THE PC HOT? ________ Handling: Get a fan in the room or handle the room so that it is cooler and the pc comfortable. 21. HAS THE PC SLEPT WELL? ________ Handling: Don’t audit a pc who has not had sufficient rest or is physically tired. (Ref. HCO PL 14 Oct 68RA, The Auditor’s Code) 22. IS THE PC COLD? ________ Handling: “A pc who is too cold sometimes has a falsely high TA. Wrap him in a blanket or get a warmer auditing room. The auditing environment is the responsibility of the auditor.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) 452 23. IS THE PC HUNGRY? ________ Handling: Get the pc something to eat and don’t audit a pc who has not had enough to eat or is hungry. (Ref. HCO PL 14 Oct 68A, The Auditor’s Code) 24. IS IT TOO LATE AT NIGHT? ________"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":" Handling: “Between 2 and 3 A. M. or late at night a pc’s TA may be very high. The time depends on when he sleeps usually. This TA will be found normal in regular hours.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) 25. IS THE AUDITING BEING DONE NOT IN THE- PC’S NORMAL REGULAR AWAKE HOURS? ________ Handling: Covered above. 26. ARE THERE RINGS ON THE PC’S HANDS? ________ Handling: “Rings on the pc’s hands must always be removed. They don’t influence TA but they give a false rock slam.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71) If the rings can’t come off use a small strip of paper around them to shield the rings touching the can. 27. IS THE PC WEARING TIGHT SHOES? ________ Handling: Remove them. (Ref. HCOB 24 Oct 71RA, HCOB 13 Jan 77RB) 28. IS THE PC WEARING TIGHT CLOTHES? Handling: If it turns out that tight clothing is affecting the TA ensure that the pc doesn’t wear tight clothes in future sessions. If possible have the pc remove the tight clothing and see what the effect was that it had on the TA and make sure no more tight clothes are worn in future sessions. 29. IS THE PC USING THE WRONG HAND CREAM? ________ Handling: Using the reference materials find the right hand cream and test it on the pc. Note TA position. 453 30. IS THE APPLICATION OF THE HAND CREAM CORRECT AND DOES IT COVER THE ENTIRE HAND? ________ Handling: Watch how the pc puts on hand cream and see if it covers the entire hand, thumb included. If not then have the pc put on hand cream covering the entire hand and pick up the cans and note TA position. Some pcs may have to put cream on and wipe it off and then reapply it. (Ref. HCOB 13 Jan 77RB) 31. IS THE CHAIR THE PC IS SITTING IN COMFORTABLE? ________ Handling: Get a new chair that is comfortable for the pc. 32. IS IT ACTUALLY A CHRONIC HIGH OR LOW TA CASE CONDITION? ________ Handling: C/ S Series 53 Assessment or Hi- Lo TA Assessment. Done to F/ Ning assessment. So standard tech handles the high and low TA. The C/ S Series gives more data on the subject. 33. HAS THE PC GONE INTO DESPAIR OVER HIS TA? ________ Handling: Handle the false TA with using this list as a guideline so that the cause"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"of false TA is found and fully handled with the pc by the various handlings covered above. When false TA is handled check TA worries, TA hassles and L1C best read. ________ This handling sheet is used in conjunction with the items that are checked. This gives you the way to handle them.

R/ SES REPEAT LEFT AND RIGHT SLASHES UNEVENLY AND SAVAGELY, FASTER THAN THE EYE EASILY FOLLOWS. THE NEEDLE IS FRANTIC. THE WIDTH OF AN R/ S DEPENDS LARGELY ON SENSITIVITY SETTING. IT GOES FROM ONE- FOURTH INCH TO WHOLE DIAL. BUT IT SLAMS BACK AND FORTH. A ROCK SLAM (R/ S) MEANS A HIDDEN EVIL INTENTION ON THE SUBJECT OR QUESTION UNDER AUDITING OR DISCUSSION. VALID R/ SES ARE NOT ALWAYS INSTANT READS. AN R/ S CAN READ PRIOR OR LATENTLY. HCOB 5 December AD12, “2- 12, 3GAXX, 3- 21 and Routine 2- 10 Modern Assessment” is an HCOB composited by others incorrectly and is CANCELED as it misdefines an R/ S as a single slash left or right. It contains the statements: “One or two slashes make an R/ S.... If it slashed up or down once call it an R/ S.” The data is utterly false. By this wrong definition a rocket read could be mistaken for an R/ S, or any sudden rise could be mistaken for an R/ S. ONE SLASH DOESN’T BEGIN TO BE AN R/ S. NOR TWO OR THREE FOR THAT MATTER. THE CORRECT DEFINITION OF AN R/ S INCLUDES THAT IT SLASHES SAVAGELY LEFT AND RIGHT. ______________ 455 DEFINITION OF A DIRTY NEEDLE The following is the only valid definition of a dirty needle: DIRTY NEEDLE: AN ERRATIC AGITATION OF THE NEEDLE WHICH IS"},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":" RAGGED, JERKY, TICKING, NOT SWEEPING, AND TENDS TO BE PERSISTENT. IT IS NOT LIMITED IN SIZE. A DIRTY NEEDLE IS CAUSED BY ONE OF THREE THINGS: 1. THE AUDITOR’S TRs ARE BAD. 2. THE AUDITOR IS BREAKING THE AUDITOR’S CODE. 3. THE PC HAS WITHHOLDS HE DOES NOT WISH KNOWN. The definitions of a dirty needle as “a small rock slam” and “a smaller edition of the rock slam” in HCOB 13 August AD12, “Rock Slams and Dirty Needles,” are CANCELED. The definition of a dirty needle as “a minute rock slam” in HCOB 1 August AD12, “Routine 3GA, Goals, Nulling by Mid Ruds,” is CANCELED. All definitions which limit the size of a dirty needle to “one quarter of an inch” or “less than one quarter of an inch” are CANCELED. A dirty needle is NOT TO BE CONFUSED with an R/ S. They are distinctly different reads. You never mistake an R/ S if you have ever seen one. A dirty needle is far less frantic. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ROCK SLAM AND A DIRTY NEEDLE IS IN THE CHARACTER OF THE READ NOT THE SIZE. Persistent use of “fish and fumble” can sometimes turn a dirty needle into a rock slam. However until it does it is simply a dirty needle. AUDITORS, C/ SES, SUPERVISORS MUST MUST MUST KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO TYPES OF READS COLD. L.

L. RON HUBBARD The following dispatch, sent in by Terry Milner and Joe Fortner, staff members of Los Angeles, describes a phenomenon which can be caused by a PC wearing rings: “A dispatch on a matter which I consider quite urgent. Since being audited quite a few rock slams have been observed on me. In the rudiments, on lists, between comm lags, button checks, in fact any method of auditing which required the use of an E- Meter. With the advent of R2- 12, I had many lists, all chock full of items that had rock slammed at one time or another. The supposedly phantom rock slam served to hang up many sessions and auditing became quite a drag even though one true package"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"was found in spite of the rock slams that went on forever. Recently I was sent to get HGC auditing and the rock slams were ever present until my Auditor, Joe Fortner, got a little suspicious and had me take off the two rings I wore, one on either hand. They disappeared. Hundreds of things that had rock slammed no longer rock slammed. Hundreds of almost, not quite reliable items are dead now and in all truth, most of them have no meaning to me anyway. Perhaps you know of this condition set up by the PC wearing rings........ the thing is most Auditors do not, nor do most PCs.

URGENT- IMPORTANT C/ S Series 99RB SCIENTOLOGY F/ N AND TA POSITION Through verbal tech just located, it has been found that some auditors have been ordered to disregard all F/ Ns that were above 3.0 or below 2.0 on the meter. Auditors have also called F/ Ns which were ARC break needles, thus falsely indicating to the pc. These two actions- disregarding actual F/ Ns because the TA was not between 2.0 and 3.0 and calling “F/ Ns” that were actually ARC break needles- have upset many preclears. The outnesses here are (a) not considering pc indicators as senior and (b) not noting pc indicators when calling an F/ N and (c) ignoring and giving junior importance to the technology covered in false TAs. (See list of references at end of this HCOB or the Subject Index of the HCOB Volumes.) Auditors have even been led to falsify worksheets (giving TA as in range when it actually was not when calling an F/ N) because they might “get in trouble” for calling an F/ N in the wrong range, such as 1.8 or 3.2. The CORRECT procedure for out of range F/ Ns is 1. Look at the pc’s indicators. 2. Call the F/ N regardless of its range. 3. Mark down the ACTUAL TA position. 4. Handle the false TA at the earliest opportunity when it will not intrude into the current cycle on which the pc is being audited. (You don’t interrupt a Quad R3RA, for instance, to handle false TA; you complete it and then, when directed by the C/ S, you handle the false TA.) 460 5. On any pc you suspect has had his F/ Ns disregarded because of false TA, you C/ S for and get run a repair and rehab of this error. E- Meter cans can monitor or change TA position when the palms are too dry or too wet or when the cans are too big or too small or when the wrong hand cream is used. The E- Meter does not read on hand moisture alone as was long believed by people in electronics. But TA depends upon resistance to electrical current in the palms, leads and meter, as well as its main resistance which happens to be mental masses or lack of them. To simply tell some intern “Always disregard an F/ N not in correct range” is to set him up for loses and set the pc up for crashes. The correct information is that"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"an F/ N which isn’t in range is accompanied by pc indicators that indicate whether it is an F/ N or not. AND indicates you better get the false TA handled fast as soon as it won’t interrupt the current cycle. AND you always note where it F/ Ned so the C/ S can C/ S for false TA handling. Where an ARC break needle (which looks like an F/ N) is observed, whether it is in range or out of range (2.0 to 3.0 or below 2.0 or above 3.0) you LOOK at the pc and establish the pc’s indicators before falsely calling an F/ N. A pc who is about to cry is NOT an F/ Ning pc and if you indicate an F/ N to that pc you will further the ARC break and suppress the emotional charge that is about to come off. REPAIR Where the above matters have not been fully understood and errors have occurred on pcs, it must be assumed that 1. Auditors have falsified their worksheets as to TA position and thus built up withholds and made themselves blowy. 2. That every pc who has ever had high or low TA trouble has had F/ Ns disregarded and ARC break F/ Ns falsely indicated. 3. That a briefing and drilling of all interns and auditors must occur on this HCOB. 4. That a brief program of cleanup of disregarded F/ Ns and falsely called ARC break F/ Ns be done on every pc. 5. That every such pc be considered as having false TA troubles and these must be C/ Sed for and corrected. 6. That all auditors and interns be drilled on all HCOBs relating to pc indicators. SAMPLE CLEANUP C/ S Disregard TA position, use only F/ Ns and pc indicators in doing this C/ S. 1. It has been found that some of your F/ Ns (release points) may have been disregarded by past or present auditors. 2. Have you ever felt an F/ N (release point or end of an action) had been bypassed on your case? 461 3. Find and rehab the overrun of the release point to F/ N. Check for any other bypassed F/ Ns and rehab them. 4. Have you ever felt an F/ N should not have been indicated by the auditor when it was? 5. Find the point and get in Suppress on it and complete the action. Check “Are there any other F/ Ns which should not have been indicated by the auditor when they were?” and handle as above. 6. Find and run the ARC breaks bypassed, with ARC break handling. 7. Find and handle the false TA in totality. "},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"DIANETIC F/ Ns An F/ N seen by the auditor in running R3RA is not called until the full Dianetic EP is reached. An auditor running R3RA is NOT looking for F/ Ns. He is looking for the postulate which is sitting at the bottom of the chain he is running. The EP of a Dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off. The postulate is what holds the chain in its place. Release the postulate and the chain blows. That’s it. The auditor must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it, note the VGIs, call the F/ N and end off auditing that chain. An F/ N seen as the incident is erasing is not called. The pc does not have to state that the incident has erased. Once he has given up the postulate, the erasure has occurred. The auditor will see an F/ N and VGls. NOW the F/ N is called.

This changes an earlier belief that, in order to be valid, the tone arm had to be between 2.0 and 3.0 for it to be called a floating needle. Carefully examining dozens of F/ Ns which occurred with the TA well above 3.0 and looking for any troubles with the case following calling the F/ N an F/ N, I found that there were no adverse consequences. Therefore, it can be safely assumed that a floating needle is a floating needle regardless of where the tone arm position may be. It should be called, indicated and written as an F/ N, with the TA noted. Palm moisture, pc grip and other factors alter the TA position but not the F/ N. The auditor must also be prepared to handle and handle false TA and nothing in this finding changes handling. Tone arm positions register the relative mass of the case and nothing in this finding changes that. There are low TA cases and high TA cases and the state of the TA remains important and all data regarding TA positions are valid. An ARC break needle (an F/ N accompanied by bad indicators) remains an ARC break needle and nothing in this finding changes that. It must be handled. (One ordinarily checks for an ARC break in this case.) This finding about TA position and F/ Ns has been corrected earlier. This present issue carries it further based on very thorough recent testing. There are apparently no liabilities of any kind in calling high and low TA F/ Ns, F/ Ns. L.

The preclear feels there is more to be done yet the auditor says “Your needle is floating. “ This is sometimes so bad that in Scientology Reviews one has to Prepcheck the subject of “Floating Needles”. A lot of by- passed charge can be stirred up which ARC Breaks (upsets) the preclear. The reason this subject of floating needles gets into trouble is that the auditor has not understood a subject called END PHENOMENA. END PHENOMENA is defined as “those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended”. It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"has been erased and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flow or a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the END PHENOMENA of the previous process is attained. DIANETICS Floating needles are only ONE FOURTH OF THE END PHENOMENA in all Dianetic auditing. Any Dianetic auditing below Power has FOUR DEFINITE REACTIONS IN THE PC WHICH SHOW THE PROCESS IS ENDED. l. Floating needle. 2. Cognition. 3. Very good indicators (pc happy). 4. Erasure of the final picture audited. Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/ N will pack up (cease) and the TA will rise. BUT that’s if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating needle. 466 If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins to float you will find: 1. It starts to float narrowly. 2. The pc cognites (What do you know- so that’s . . .) and the float widens. 3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and 4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial. That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics. If the auditor sees a float start, as in I and says, “I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating,” he can upset the pc’s bank. There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won’t appear and a piece of the picture is left. By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor’s premature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc’s end phenomena. SCIENTOLOGY All this also applies to Scientology auditing. And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena. The 0 to IV Scientology end phenomena are: A. Floating needle. B. Cognition."},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":" C. Very good indicators. D. Release. The pc goes through these four steps without fail IF PERMITTED TO DO SO. As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/ N vanished and TA rising, requiring “rehab”) can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be more alert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena. The same cycle of F/ N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a beginning F/ N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely. “I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” can be a chop. Also it’s a false report if it isn’t widely floating and will keep floating. Pcs who leave session F/ N and arrive at Examiner without F/ N, or who eventually do not come to session with an F/ N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/ N chop, as described in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc after he has exteriorized will also give a high TA at examiner.) In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomena above. I know it said in the Auditor’s Code not to by- pass an F/ N. Perhaps it should be changed to read “A real wide F/ N”. 467 Here it’s a question of how wide is an F/ N? However, the problem is NOT difficult. I follow this rule- l never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In other words, I don’t ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it’s his case we are handling, not my actions as an auditor. When I see an F/ N begin I listen for the pc’s cognition. If it isn’t there, I give the next command due. If it still isn’t there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition and shut up. The needle floats more widely, VGls come in, the F/ N goes dial wide. The real skill is involved in knowing when to say nothing more. Then with the pc, all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/ N, cog, VGls, erasure or Release, depending on whether it’s Dn or Scn) I say, as though agreeing with the pc, “Your needle is floating.” DIANETIC ODDITY Did you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/ N getting wider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. The picture hasn’t been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully and wow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn’t grinding. It’s waiting for the F/ N to broaden to cognition. The pc who complains about F/ Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actual problem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and the meter a moment too soon."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":" The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward. Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often will begin to refuse auditing. Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an erasure leaves nothing to get the TA up with! The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily. There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientology as a problem than to Dianetics. But ALL auditors must realize that the END PHENOMENA of successful auditing is not just an F/ N but has 3 more requisites. And an auditor can chop these off. The mark of the real VIRTUOSO (master) in auditing is his skilled handling of the floating needle. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH :jz. ei. rd Copyright ©1970 by L.

As a Clear’s postulates read as a surge, usually fairly long (over 1”), “No” can read if the pc says it to himself as an answer to a question asked. A read, therefore, does not mean invariably “yes” or that the question is charged. All it means is that the Meter has read. The Auditor must now find out what the read was before determining he should do something about that portion of the Green Form or List. One doesn’t just assume the read was “yes”. One asks about the read as a general rule, not assuming at once the thing asked was charged. Example- Auditor: “Do you have a missed withhold?” Meter surges. Auditor: “What was that?” Pre: “I thought No I don’t.” Auditor: “Ok. Do you have a missed withhold?” Pre: “No.”- Meter didn’t read. Auditor: “Anything suppressed- asserted- protested- invalidated. Ok that’s clean. Ticks (1/ 8 inch) often mean something is there. A Pre OT’s postulates have greater length when they surge. It is not important how you handle this phenomena of postulate or to oneself- comment by a high level case. It is important that the Auditor does not hang the case with a wrong adjudication of what’s wrong by thinking every surge means “yes”"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"or that the question is charged because it surges. A question is charged only if it won’t clean up with buttons until the action itself is taken. A Pre, unlike pcs below Grades I or II, usually recognizes what is wrong as soon as it is mentioned. He or she is more aware. 2. A response like a brief dirty needle on a Pre means “No” always. So there is a certain and trustworthy negative to be had on a Pre. A real dirty needle is constant and continues. The same small jerky needle action on a person Grade 5 or above means “No!” or that the question is negative. On pcs below 5 it means a withhold or an ARC break or almost anything and is of course continuous. LRH: jc. rd L. RON HUBBARD Copyright © 1968 Founder by L.

Here are some observations I have made on the coaching of E- Meter drills, which I feel could be of use: 1. The coach’s needle is dirty. The student’s out comm cycle has cut his comm in some way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cycle that went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles. 2. If a coach’s TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that the student’s comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach is either ( I ) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing. 3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed him and pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blow down. If there is no blow down, the coach has flunked the wrong thing. 4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although the needle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR0) for lack of impingement and reach. 5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR I is out with the student. 6. Student asking coach for considerations to get TA down, but TA climbing on the considerations- the coach is cleaning a clean, instead of flunking the out comm cycle, which occurred earlier and pushed his TA up. "},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"7. Student getting coach’s considerations off to clean the needle, but needle remaining dirty- student is cutting the coach’s comm while getting the considerations off and the coach is not picking this up. 8. Student’s shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get the Meter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably-” but I’m assessing the bank!” They haven’t realized that banks don’t read, only thetans impinged upon by the bank- therefore the TR 1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meter responds proportionately to the amount of ARC in the Session. L. RON HUBBARD LRH: emp. rd Copyright © 1965 by L. Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 470 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 25 MAY 1962 Central Orgs Franchise E- METER INSTANT READS An instant read is defined as that reaction of the needle which occurs at the precise end of any major thought voiced by the auditor. The reaction of the needle may be any reaction except “nul”. An instant read may be any change of characteristic providing it occurs instantly. The absence of a read at the end of the major thought shows it to be nul. All prior reads and latent reads are ignored. These are the result of minor thoughts which may or may not be restimulated by the question. Only the instant read is used by the auditor. Only the instant read is cleared on rudiments, what questions, etc. The instant read may consist of any needle reaction, rise, fall, speeded rise, speeded fall, double tick (dirty needle), theta bop or any other action so long as it occurs at the exact end of the major thought being expressed by the auditor. If no reaction occurs at exactly that place (the end of the major thought) the question is nul. By “major thought” is meant the complete thought being expressed in words by the auditor. Reads which occur prior to the completion of the major thought are “prior reads”. Reads which occur later than its completion are “latent reads”. By minor thought is meant subsidiary thoughts expressed by words within the major thought. They are caused by the reactivity of individual words within the full words. They are ignored. Example: “Have you ever injured dirty pigs?” To the pc the words “you”, “injured” and “dirty” are all reactive. Therefore, the minor thoughts expressed by these words also read on the meter. The major thought here is the whole sentence. Within this thought are the minor thoughts “you”, “injured” and “dirty”. Therefore the E- Meter needle may respond this way: “Have you (fall) ever injured (speeded fall) dirty (fall) pigs? (fall)?” "},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Only the major thought gives the instant read and only the last fall (underscored in the sentence above) indicates anything. If that last reaction was absent, the whole sentence is nul despite the prior falls. 471 You can release the reactions (but ordinarily would not) on each of these minor thoughts. Exploring these prior reads is called “compartmenting the question”. Paying attention to minor thought reads gives us laughable situations as in the case, written in 1960, of “getting P. D. H. ed by the cat”. By accepting these prior reads one can prove anything. Why? Because Pain and Drug and Hypnosis are minor thoughts within the major thought: “Have you ever been P. D. H. ed by a cat?” The inexpert auditor would believe such a silly thing had happened. But notice that if each minor thought is cleaned out of the major thought it no longer reacts as a whole fact. If the person on the meter had been P. D. H. ed by a cat, then only the discovery of the origin of the whole thought would clean up the whole thought. Pcs also think about other things while being asked questions and these random personal restimulations also read before and after an instant read and are ignored. Very rarely, a pc’s thinks react exactly at the end of a major thought and so confuse the issue, but this is rare. We want the read that occurs instantly after the last syllable of the major thought without lag. That is the only read we regard in finding a rudiment in or out, to find if a goal reacts, etc. That is what is called an “instant read”. There is a package rudiment question in the half truth, etc. We are doing four rudiments in one and therefore have four major thoughts in one sentence. This packaging is the only apparent exception but is actually no exception. It’s just a fast way of doing four rudiments in one sentence. A clumsy question which puts “in this session” at the end of the major thought can serve the auditor badly. Such modifiers should come before the sentence, “In this session have you......?” You are giving the major thought directly to the reactive mind. Therefore any analytical thought will not react instantly. The reactive mind is composed of: 1. Timelessness. 2. Unknownness. 3. Survival. The meter reacts on the reactive mind, never on the analytical mind. The meter reacts instantly on any thought restimulated in the reactive mind. If the meter reacts on anything, that datum is partly or wholly unknown to the preclear. An auditor’s questions restimulate the reactive mind. This reacts on the meter. 472 "},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"Only reactive thoughts react instantly. You can “groove in” a major thought by saying it twice. On the second time (or third time if it is longer) you will see only the instant read at the exact end. If you do this the prior reads drop out leaving only the whole thought. If you go stumbling around in rudiments or goals trying to clean up the minor thoughts you will get lost. In sec checking you can uncover material by “compartmenting the question” but this is rarely done today. In rudiments, what questions, et al, you want the instant read only. It occurs exactly at the end of the whole thought. This is your whole interest in cleaning a rudiment or a what question. You ignore all prior and latent reactions of the needle. The exceptions to this rule are 1. “Compartmenting the question”, in which you use the prior reads occurring at the exact end of the minor thoughts (as above in the pigs sentence) to dig up different data not related to the whole thought. 2. “Steering the pc” is the only use of latent or random reads. You see a read the same as the instant read occurring again when you are not speaking but after you have found a whole thought reacting. You say “there” or “that” and the pc, seeing what he or she is looking at as you say it recovers the knowledge from the reactive bank and gives the data and the whole thought clears or has to be further worked and cleared. You can easily figure- figure yourself half to death trying to grapple with meter reads unless you get a good reality on the instant read which occurs at the end of the whole expressed thought and neglect all prior and latent reads except for steering the pc while he gropes for the answer to the question you asked. That’s the whole of reading an E- Meter needle. (Two Saint Hill lectures of 24 May 1962 cover this in full.) L. RON HUBBARD LRH: jw. bp. rd Copyright © 1962 by L.

I have been a bit surprised by the length of time it is taking people to do assessments on the Prehav, on Security Checks and goals. A query into this, which may reveal more, has discovered that students wait patiently for the meter to react, which Mary Sue has noticed. It dawns on me that auditors believe they are doing an analytical assessment on the Prehav, etc. This is wrong."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":" The Prehav Scale is not a picture of analytical thought. It is in the order it is in because it is a picture of reactive thought. It is how the reactive mind is stacked up. (See Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health for the chapter on the reactive mind.) Now an E- Meter reacts only on the reactive mind. A Clear doesn’t react because he is able to be conscious. An aberree reacts because he can’t think without thought exciting the reactivity of the reactive mind. This, being composed of mass, energy, space, time and thought, responds to tiny electrical impulses. If your auditing was not aimed at reactivity it would not register on a meter. Thus, you run what reacts because it reacts and is therefore part of the reactive mind. The reactive mind responds instantly on data a billion years ago. How is this? Time in the reactive mind is out of order. So is space. So is matter, so is energy. Pin a sign on the reactive mind: “Out of Order.” It connects wrong connections. Hence, the E- Meter. What is wrong with the pc is not known to the pc. Therefore if a pc knows all about it, it isn’t wrong with him. That’s why you never run what the pc says. You run only what the meter says. Example: pc is sure his current general Prehav Level that should be run now is “Order or Command.” “Order” rapidly vanishes. “Command” follows suit. CONQUER stays in. This is an actual example. I just assessed it a few minutes ago on a pc who is in pretty good shape. He didn’t like CONQUER. He said Order and Command were long track. Somebody running a Q and A on his assessment would have said, perhaps, the pc knows best, so we’ll run Order. Even if it doesn’t fall. But when I said it was CONQUER that we were going to run as only it now fell, the pc sighed and gave in. Finding the Conquer level questions produced a very responsive meter needle. 474 It was wrong with the pc because he didn’t know about it. It was part of his reactive mind. Order and Command were analytical responses prompted by an entirely different thing CONQUER. If Order or Command had been run the pc would have had a lot of auditing time wasted on him. Now, why are assessments wrong sometimes? Because the auditor is persuaded by the pc, not the meter. If the pc and the meter agree, so what. You can still run it. But only if the meter says so. for only then is it reactive. Now, what about slow assessments? Well, the auditor thinks the pc must consider things before he answers, waits for the pc to answer and waits for the question to sink in so the meter will react. This is entirely wrong. Based on a misunderstanding of assessment, the meter and the reactive mind. 1. The pc does not have to be given a chance to think before the needle responds. 2. The pc does not have to answer or say one word to make the needle respond. 3. All needle response is reactive. 4. There is no time in the reactive mind."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":" 5. If the pc knew what was wrong with him it wouldn’t be wrong. 6. Only the meter knows. 7. The auditor has more control over the pc’s reactive mind than the pc since the pc is influenced by the reactive mind responses and the auditor is not so influenced. The meter responds instantly. The reaction you will get on the needle starts to occur on the needle instantly after you utter it. There is no need to sit there afterwards waiting for the needle to respond again. for it won’t until you push that button again. The only wait is caused by letting the needle come back at the end of a fall. This may take one second. Therefore: TO WAIT MORE THAN ONE SECOND BEFORE UTTERING THE NEXT WORD ON THE LIST IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF AUDITING TIME. All the response you want will begin to occur instantly after you utter a goal, terminal, level or security question. Thus the maximum time between questions on the Prehav Level is at most a three- second interval of silence while you digest the data. Further, on an assessment for a Prehav run on the General Scale (as in Routine 2, HCOB 5 June 1961), you do not now say. “Do you . . .” or any other dunnage. 475 You just say the level itself, note response, put a pencil point down on the level if it responds, say the next word, etc., etc. Takes about 5 minutes to run the Primary Scale up and down to find its level. You start at the bottom. You just say the word. If it responds you dot the sheet (using different symbols to tell them apart like dots, X’s, lines). Then go back down the scale touching only those you marked going up. Add another dot if they still fall or react. Then play off those left one against the other, saying a level only once each time. The remaining level is now the only one that reacts. So you assemble your 5- way bracket and carry on with auditing. The pc doesn’t have to say a word throughout the whole assessment. You can even ask him politely not to, as breath going in and out in speech can vibrate the needle. When you assess over into the Secondary Scale of the level you found. you do exactly the same as above. You read them all off once, then only those that reacted, eliminate them and you’ve got it. (And, by the way, if you go over the Secondary Scale, you then don’t only run levels on that Secondary forever; in each new assessment you use the Primary Scale again to find a new Secondary Level to assess.) This is also true of a Joburg. If you’re going to get a reaction on the needle, it will come fast. No waiting. If you get a reaction you clear that reaction, not the pc’s whole life. The moment the needle is null, you go on to the next question. Of course, in a Joburg. the pc talks. He better! All auditing actions except the CCHs are now done in Model Session. And all"},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"auditing actions and questions are done effectively. neither frantically rushed nor slowly. So it boils down to this. Weeks can be added to Joburgs and assessments if you think you have to wait for a needle response. What are you waiting for? The whole action only requires a second. Don’t wait for the E- Meter to play Dixie. It was made in the Nawth. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH: imj. rd. jk Copyright © 1961. 1979 by L.

Thus an instant read which occurs when the auditor assesses an item or calls a question is valid and would be taken up and latent reads, which occur fractions of seconds after the major thought, are ignored.

The pc is not required to comment during this action and it is better if he does not."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":" This action is called “Assessment for Longest Read”. It is used mainly in Dianetics. There are two Scientology assessments which are differently done. These are “Assessment by Elimination” and “Listing and Nulling”. They are not used in Dianetics. One does not mix the three types. In Dianetic Assessment by Longest Read one uses these symbols: X - didn’t read Tick - small jerk of needle sF - Small Fall (a quarter to half an inch) F - Fall (about one to 2 inches) LF - Long Fall (2 to 3 inches) LFBD - Long Fall followed by a “blow down” or TA motion downward. All falls are to the right. A “BD” is a Tone Arm motion to the left made to keep the needle on the dial. The favored action for an item is an LFBD and if one item on the list does so, that is it without any further assessment. The reason one assesses is that IF AN ITEM DOES NOT READ ON THE METER WHEN ASSESSED IT IS BEYOND THE PC’S LEVEL OF AWARENESS. It is very unwise and unsafe to try to run a somatic which has not read on the list. It will be beyond the pc’s reality and beyond his awareness and will result in overwhelming him. That an item reads guarantees that the pc will be able to confront and erase the chain. So that an item reads well is a guarantee that the pc can handle it and will not get in too deep for him. The exception to this is a PROTEST read. An item possibly already run, is seen to read. The pc frowns. He is protesting and the meter is registering protest, not the item. One never runs a pc against his protest. To do so will overwhelm him and give a bad result. 478 A protest almost never blows down the TA. To be sure that the item is right, one usually asks the pc if he is interested in the item chosen. If the pc says no, he doesn’t want to run it, this is a protest read. One then picks the second best reading item on the assessment already done and checks that with the pc for interest. The pc will usually be interested in it. The pc can almost always be counted on to be interested in any item that gives a LFBD. One never simply asks the pc which on the list he is interested in as “an assessment” as it will be found the pc simply chooses at random and may choose a null item. The result may be a very unsuccessful session. An auditor may sometimes be astonished by what reads. The pc, let us say, obviously has a broken leg but what reads is an earache. One runs what reads, not what the auditor knows should be run. A “know best” in an auditor can be a fatal fault. On a second or third assessment items which were at first null or reading poorly will be found to “come alive” and read well. The pc, by being audited has had an increase of ability to confront and, if the auditing is standard, an increase in confidence. The result is that items beyond his reach previously (and did not read"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"well) are now available and can be run easily. The E- Meter measures the awareness depth of the pc. On things which do not read on assessment you would find his reality poor. Things that read well on assessment will be found to be things on which a pc has a high reality and a high interest level. Only if pushed to audit without a meter could an auditor assess by interest only. There is no real excuse for it if one has an E- Meter. Auditing without a meter is a chancy activity. Good assessment by longest read is the best entrance to a successful session. The same list will serve for the next item to be run and should be used rather than just asking the pc. L.

Ron Hubbard ALL RIGHTS RESERVED 479 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 22 JULY 1978 Remimeo All Auditors ASSESSMENT TRs The right way to do an assessment is to ask the pc the question in a questioning tone of voice. In assessing, some auditors have made assessment questions into statements of fact, which of course is a cousin to evaluation. A downcurve at the end of an assessment question contributes to making it a statement. Questions should go up at the end. A remedy for this is to record ordinary conversation. Ask some normal questions and make some normal statements and you will find that the voice tone rises on a question and goes down on a statement. Assessing with a statement’s tone of voice instead of a questioning tone of voice results in evaluation for the pc. The pc feels accused or evaluated for rather than assessed and an auditor can get a lot of false and protest reads. It’s all tone of voice. Auditors have to be drilled in asking questions. Assessment questions have an upcurve at the end. Get it? Then drill it. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH: lfg Copyright © 1978 by L.

The basic trouble with a single- hand electrode is that it gives a falsely higher TA which can be very alarming. The Tone Arm range on the Meter should be between 2.0 and 3.0 for a floating needle to be valid. This is when two regulation electrodes (steel soup cans) are employed. When you use only one electrode, holding it in the left hand if you are right- handed, the TA can read as high as 4.0 when it is actually 3.0. Also a TA at 1.7 can read as 2.5 ! Single- hand electrodes are almost as old as the modern meter. An aluminum tea ball with an insulator between the screw threads served in the earliest models, an electrode leading to each half. Two stainless steel pipe sections about an inch in diameter, separated in the middle by a rubber ring, with an electrode to each end was a single- hand electrode version which came down to modern times. There were no further developments of any lasting value on this problem of singlehand electrodes until a few months ago. The problem in Solo Auditing is of course that if you held electrodes in both hands you couldn’t write or work the meter at the same time. BUT a single- hand electrode gives the wrong TA even if it does give the right needle reads (which it does). To get the right TA then one must unplug the single- hand electrode and plug in the two- hand electrode. In this operation the TA can change and the wires get tangled. This commotion is of course distracting. What I worked out was a two- can electrode that became a single- hand electrode at once. You take 2 small juice or vegetable steel cans with their tops neatly removed. They must be the paper label, not the painted kind of course. The size required is 2 1/ 8 inches diameter at the rim (that is about 54 millimeters). The length is 3 3/ 4 inches (which is about 95 millimeters). 481 You then take a piece of soft sponge or foam rubber about 3/ 8 inches thick (about 10 mm). You cut a circular piece of sponge rubber about 2 3/ 8 inches (about 60 mm). It is just slightly larger than the can diameter. You glue this sponge or foam rubber circle to the closed end of one can but not to the other. Snap the electrode wires into the open ends of the cans. You now have to all requirements a two- can electrode setup, with the difference that one can’s base has a rubber pad on it. Holding these one in each hand gives you the 2- can more correct TA read. By putting the closed base of one can against the rubber pad on the other can,"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"taking them in one hand (two fingers on each can as you hold them) you have a single- hand electrode. In an instant you can take them in two hands and get the correct TA (adjusting the Tone Arm with a knuckle or finger tip). Taking them back in one hand and resetting the TA you again have your single- hand read. In using this system you should change your notation to an indication of whether it is a one- hand or two- can read (to save your Case Supervisor from heart failure). The new notation is as follows: 3.75 (1) 2.9 (2). It doesn’t mean you always use both reads. You add the brackets and a 2 or 1 to show whether it’s a double or single (2) or (1) read. At session start and at end you always give both, i. e. 3.5 (1) 2.5 (2). And at the end you give a trim check like 1.9 = 2.0 (done by unplugging the electrodes from the meter for an instant and putting the needle at set and reading what the TA is). It should be 2.0 but often has drifted to 1.9 or 2.1. That verifies all reads. STANDARD ELECTRODES A standard can is about 23/ 4 inches (69 mm) diameter by about 41/ 2 or 5 inches (114 mm or 127 mm) long. Steel soup or vegetable cans, unpainted, tops cleanly removed, label and glue washed off, tin plated or not, have been standard for many years. It is with these that calibration has been done. It is amusing that I had to work hard on electrodes to get the first meters to work at all. Everything got tried. Steel rods, aluminum (aluminum) tea balls, metal pads, metal straps, you name it. The only one that works consistently is the good old common kitchen variety soup can. It’s amusing to see efforts to “improve our electrodes”. Other versions have all been tried and failed and every few years we have to have a soup can revival campaign to get people back to standard reads. The smaller juice can as described for the single- hand electrode does not give the exact read as the standard cans when used as a two- can electrode. So the smaller can shouldn’t be used by Examiners. You can check the difference if you like between these two can sizes. 482 But the standard cans are too big as a one- hand to be held comfortably in most people’s left hand. The difference is not great enough to worry anyone in normal auditing. SMALL HANDS People with small hands or children can’t cope at all with a standard can. The size given for the single- hand (2 1/ 8” x 33/ 4”) is more suitable for them. For very little children, two Kodak 35 mm unpainted cassette cans from any photo shop will serve admirably. These two 35 mm cassettes fixed with a rubber pad on the bottom of one as described for the single- hand electrode above will serve a child as a one- hand electrode. SHORTING "},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"The whole trick in preparing two separate cans to be held as a single- hand is to make sure that when you put the bottoms together they don’t short. They can cause a “rock slam” or a sudden fall if the metal of the cans touch. Thus the glued- on rubber pad must be a bit bigger than the can diameter and thick enough so it doesn’t press through. Old setups were bolted together and couldn’t be separated easily for two- can reads. These two cans are loose from each other. Important note: The smaller cans can give a falsely low TA read being small. If you get such a read, have two large standard cans handy to snap onto the leads and check. Will save heart failure at seeing 1.7 for two- can read! L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH: sb .rd Copyright © 1970 by L.

It can occasionally happen that an auditor misses a read on an item or question and does not run it as it “has not read”. This can hang up a pc badly if the item was in fact a reading item or question. It does not get handled and exists in records as “No read” when in fact it DID read.

It is duly marked (plus any blow down). THIS"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"reading defines what is a reading item or question. CALLING IT BACK TO SEE IF IT READ IS NOT A VALID TEST as the surface charge may be gone but the item or question will still run or list. 3. Regardless of any earlier statements or material on READING ITEMS, an item does not have to read when the auditor calls it to be a valid item for running engrams or listing. The test is did it read when the pc first said it on originating it or in Clearing it? 4. That an item or question is marked as having read is sufficient reason to run it or use it or list it. Pc Interest, in Dianetics, is also necessary to run it, but that it did not read again is no reason to not use it. 5. When listing items the auditor must have an eye on the meter NOT necessarily the pc and must note on the list he is making the extent of read and any BD and how much. THIS is enough to make it a “reading item” or “reading question”. 6. In Clearing a listing Question the auditor watches the meter, NOT necessarily the pc and notes any read while clearing the question. 7. An additional calling of the item or question to see if it read is unnecessary and not a valid action if the item or question read on origination or Clearing. 8. That an item is marked as having read on an earlier Dianetic list is enough (also checking interest) to run it with no further read test. 485 9. To miss seeing a read on an origin or clearing is a Gross Auditing Error. 10. Failing to mark on the list or worksheet the read and any BD seen during pc origination or clearing the question is a Gross Auditing Error. EYESIGHT Auditors who miss reads or have poor eyesight should be tested and should wear the proper glasses while auditing. GLASSES The rims of some glasses could obstruct seeing the meter while the auditor is looking at the worksheet or pc. If this is the case the glasses should be changed to another type with broader vision. WIDE VISION A good auditor is expected to see his meter, pc and worksheet all at one time. No matter what he is doing he should always notice any meter movement if the meter needle moves. If he cannot do this he should use an Azimuth meter and not put paper over its glass but should do his worksheet looking through the glass at his pen and the paper- the original design purpose of the Azimuth Meter. Then even while writing he sees the meter needle move as it is in his line of vision.

The Prepared List provides the auditor with a stable action when a session or ease is confusing and can bring things under control. The idea of such lists and their development are original to Dianetics and Scientology. They are made possible because these subjects embrace the full extent of thought, the spirit and actual and potential aberration. Thousands of hours of research and development have gone into these lists. Thousands of case histories have been reviewed and condensed to make the lists possible. They are, in themselves, a considerable tour de force. They have often meant the difference between a stalled case and a spectacular result. Just as they are important, a knowledge of them and skill in their use is vital to auditing success. HISTORY Probably the oldest “prepared list” is the White Form, (now called THE ORIGINAL ASSESSMENT SHEET - HCOB 24 Jun 78R). This provided a series of questions which"},{"pageNumber":379,"pageContent":"would give one the background of the preclear. It dates from 1950. By it one can get the probable this life areas of the preclear’s heaviest charge. SELF ANALYSIS was written in 1951. It contains processing lists a preclear could run on himself. Group Auditing materials of the middle 50s contained lists of commands which were run on groups. Done on a meter, it provides a case entrance. The “Joburg” of 1961 is probably the next historical point. It was a list of the possible withholds a preclear might have. It was called the “Joburg” because it was developed in Johannesburg, South Africa. The “L1” was probably next. The original gave a list of session rudiments which might have gone out and enabled the auditor to get the session rudiments back in. It is still in use as “L1C” or “List One C”. The “Green Form” was developed in the early 60s so that Qual Review at Saint Hill would have a tool to analyze a case. Correction lists for various auditing actions began to appear. These corrected an action in progress that had gone awry. In 1973, the famous “C/ S 53” (meaning “Case Supervisor Series 53”) was devised and continued to be improved and reissued. Today there are dozens of Prepared Lists. There is even a prepared list to repair repaired lists in general. 487 THEORY OF PREPARED LISTS A Prepared List is an assembly of the majority of things which can be wrong in a case, an auditing action or a session. Such lists are quite remarkable, actually. Only a thorough knowledge of aberration makes such a list possible. when you look over the extent of Prepared Lists, you will see that they contain a grasp of the subject of aberration never before available. USE While an auditor is expected to have studied and mastered all this theory, it is a bit much to expect that in the confusion of & case or session gone wrong he will be able to spot instantly, without help, exactly WHAT has gone wrong. Prepared Lists, where they exist, and his E- Meter will sort this out for him. All the auditor has to have is a general insight that something is going wrong, know in general what is being handled in the case, knows what list to use and then, with good TRs and metering, do an assessment of the Prepared List. Usually the trouble will come right, since the exact point will have been located. It is sometimes enough to merely indicate the point found to discharge it somewhat. One can F/ N what is found or one can go into very wide, extensive handling. The point is, the use of the Prepared List has spotted the trouble. What is demanded of the auditor or C/ S is WHICH Prepared List to use, but this is determined by what has been going on. TYPES OF PREPARED LISTS"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":" There are four general types of Prepared Lists. These are: A. An ANALYSIS list. This is a type of Prepared List which analyzes a case broadly or analyzes a session. The purpose of it is to find out what to address in the case in order to program it. The White Form, the Green Form and the C/ S 53 can all be used for this purpose. There are other such lists and there is even a Prepared List to debug production. B. A direct AUDITING list. Prepared Lists exist which deliver direct auditing commands or questions which, run on the pc, produce an auditing result. The lists Or SELF ANALYSIS and the various Confessional Lists form this type of Prepared List. C. A CORRECTION list. This type of list corrects an ongoing action. Examples are the Word Clearing Correction List, the Int Rundown Correction List, the Dianetic Correction List. There is a bit of a gray area in this type of list as one can also use some of them for analysis as in the case of a Course Supervisor Correction List or a Student Correction List. The C/ S 53 can also serve as a correction list. The real difference is what the list is being used for - to analyze to find out what to program or start or to correct something already in progress. D. DRILL lists. These are used in training as dummy lists to get an auditor used to handling the meter and Prepared Lists. Such lists are contained in the Book of E- Meter Drills. METHOD OF HANDLING There are three methods of handling Prepared Lists, depending on the type of list. There is simply the method of asking the questions in sequence and getting the answer from the preclear. This would apply to a White Form or to auditing Prepared Lists as in Self Analysis or in Group Auditing. Very few lists are handled in this way. 488 The second way is called “Method 3” wherein the list is assessed on a meter and when a read is noted, the meter- reading question is taken up with the preclear and F/ Ned. Method 3 is covered in HCOB 3 Jul 71 AUDITING BY LISTS. The third way is called “Method 5”. This type of assessment assesses the whole Prepared List rapidly without getting the preclear to talk and the reads are then noted. The largest read or reads are then taken up and F/ Ned. Method 5 is covered in HCOB 3 Jul 71 AUDITING BY LISTS. TRS AND METERING Whether or not a Prepared List reads depends upon the auditor’s TRs and metering. At one time or another Case Supervisors have had a great deal of trouble with this. Accuracy as to what really read was greatly in question. This came to view on Flag in the early 70s when Prepared Lists that had been assessed by Class IV trainees were then reassessed, same list, same pc shortly after the first list assessment,"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"by Class XIIs. Totally different results were found - lists on which few or no reads were obtained by the Class IV trainees were found to be very live by the Class XIIs. The difference of quality of’ TRs and metering were what made the difference with the prepared list response. HCOB 22 April 1980 contains the drills which remedy this. It is the TRs and metering of’ the auditor that makes a prepared list reliable, not the list itself’. The champion list of all time is the C/ S 53. On one page, any general thing that can be aberrated in a thetan has been assembled. There are two forms of it - Short Form for preclears who know the terms and Long Form for preclears who are unindoctrinated (they are the same lists but the Short Form is in single word and the Long Form is a full question). A Director of Processing giving a D of’ P Interview can use one of these and obtain enough material to enormously help a Case Supervisor. It is not the only D of’ P Interview action but it is very helpful when used. An auditor can debug a program or a session with it. It can analyze a case for programming and it can also be used to correct a program or to correct a session. Originally it was developed to handle high and low Tone Arm cases and although it still says this, it also says it can “correct case outnesses”. And today, this is its greatest use. PRIORITY of handling outnesses is a vital part of C/ S 53. The first three groups of’ items - (Interiorization outnesses), B (List errors) and C (rudiments) - give the necessary order of handling. If’ Int is reading, nothing else can be handled until it is. List errors take the next priority. Then rudiments. If one were to try to repair a case out of’ sequence, a mess could occur. So this Prepared List also gives the sequence in which outnesses must be handled. The main fault is using a C/ S 53 is overuse - an auditor reaching for it when he gets in trouble instead of improving the auditor’s own TRs, metering or knowledge of programming in the first place. But the C/ S 53 is one of the most valuable tools an Auditor or a Case Supervisor has. GENERAL CASE HANDLING The Prepared Lists of all types place in the hands of the Case Supervisor and the auditor a procedure by which a case can be analyzed and programmed. Some auditing can be done direct from Prepared Lists. 489 WORD CLEARING PREPARED LISTS It can happen that a Prepared List gets stalled on misunderstood words. For many Prepared Lists there are also full word clearing lists which can be done on the pc. At one time it was thought that before one did a list one should ALWAYS word clear lt. However, this has the liability that a pc who is in one kind of trouble can’t sit still until a full word clearing action is done. The amount of trouble which came from Prepared Lists came more from assessing and metering errors than it did from misunderstood words. When one is using a prepared list on a pc who has never had it word cleared, it is"},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"usually enough to check that the read isn’t coming from a Mis U. Early in a pc’s auditing, about the time he gets a CS- l, the more critical prepared lists should be word cleared and the fact noted in his folder. But when one is doing this word clearing, tone arm action or significant reads should also be noted. One is liable to think he is word clearing whereas he is actually assessing. True, there are a lot of tech words on a prepared list that the pc isn’t likely to know. Unfortunately, the discoveries of Scientology exceed common language and require terms of their own. But a pc catches on to this quite rapidly. They are new ideas to him (even though he was been living with them all the eons of his existence). When the word is cleared, the idea is also thrown into action. So it is important to note meter reads and tone arm actions when clearing the words of prepared lists. No hard and fast rules can be drawn on this point of word clearing Prepared Lists. If you have already word cleared the key words of a key Prepared List before you need it, thank your stars. Otherwise carry on and hope. SUMMARY A Case Supervisor and an auditor owe it to themselves to have a good command of this subject of Prepared Lists. There are many issues on the subject. There are dozens of Prepared Lists. L. RON HUBBARD FOUNDER LRH: DM: mh Copyright © 1980 by L.

It is more important to see the pc’s cans than his face as can fiddle can fake or upset reads. TR I must be good so the pc clearly hears it. You are looking for an INSTANT READ that occurs at the end of the exact last syllable of the question. 491 If it does not read, mark the list X. If the list is being done through an F/ N and the F/ N just continues, mark the question F/ N. If the question reads, do not say “That reads.” Mark the read at once (tick, SF, F. LF, LFBD, R/ S), transfer the number of the Q to the W/ S and look expectantly at the pc. You can repeat the Q by just saying it again if pc doesn’t begin to talk. He has probably already begun to answer as the Q was live in his bank as noted by the meter. Take down the pc’s remarks in shortened form on the W/ S. Note any TA changes on the W/ S. If the pc’s answer results in an F/ N (cog VGIs sometimes follow, GIs always accompany a real F/ N), mark it rapidly on the W/ S and say, “Thank you. I would like to indicate your needle is floating.” Do NOT wait endlessly for the pc to say more. If you do he will go into doubt and find more, also do NOT chop what he is saying.

Those that do not read you X as out. The next question that reads, you mark it on the list, transfer the question number to the W/S. Take the pc’s answer. Follow the above E/ S procedure as needed until you get an F/ N and Gls for the question. Ack. Indicate and return to the mimeoed list. You keep this up until you have done the whole list in this fashion. If you got no read on the list question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unreading question, do NOT take it up. Just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list. BELIEVE YOUR METER. Do not take up things that don’t read. Don’t get “hunches.” Don’t let the pc run his own case by answering nonreading items and then the auditor taking them up. 492 Also don’t let a pc “fiddle the cans” to get a false read or to obscure a real one. (Very rare but these two actions have happened.) BIG WIN If halfway down a prepared list (the last part not yet done) the pc on some question gets a wide F/ N, big cog, VGIs, the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next C/ S action or ending the session, except in the case where an F/ Ning list is C/ Sed for, e. g. C/ S 53RL. The auditor does not violate C/ S Series 20 PERSISTENT F/ N. If he is intending to F/ N the list, and the pc is on a big win, the auditor would end off, let the pc have his win, and then in another later session, continue with the list. There are two reasons for this- one, the F/ N will usually just persist and can’t be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win. The auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it, if it does not violate C/ S Series 20 PERSISTENT F/ N. GF AND METHOD 3 When a GF is taken up Method 3 (item by item, one at a time) one ends it at the first F/ N (Reference: HCOB 8 Dec 78 ll GREEN FORM AND EXPANDED GREEN FORM 40RD, USE OF). If the auditor were to continue, it can occur that the TA will go suddenly high. The pc feels he is being repaired, that the clearing up of the first item on the GF handled it and protests. It is the protest that sends the TA up. Thus a GF is best done by Method 5 (once through for reads, then the reads handled). L1C, L3RF, L7 and other such lists are best done Method 3. The above steps and actions are exactly how you do Auditing by List today. Any earlier data contrary to this is canceled. Only 2 points change- we F/ N everything that reads by E/ S or a process to handle (L3RF requires processes, not E/ S to get an F/ N)"},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"or else check for false read if the pc shows manifestations of this, and we never tell the pc that it read or didn’t read, thus putting his attention on the meter. We still indicate F/ Ns to the pc as a form of completion. L1C and Method 3 are NOT used on high or very low TAs to get them down or up. The purpose of these lists is to clean up bypassed charge. An auditor also indicates when he has finished with the list. An auditor should dummy drill this action both on a doll and bullbait. The action is very successful when precisely done. L.

There are some other points. For some reason C/ Ses are being inventive instead of following the C/ S Series and doing standard repairs and grades. Probably the failure to use Prepared Correction Lists derails the use of standard actions. There are very few actions which do not have their own Correction Lists. THERE IS NOTHING IN DIANETICS AND SCIENTOLOGY AS MIRACULOUSLY WORKABLE AS CORRECTION LISTS. The only things which prevent the list from working are (a) AUDITOR’S METERING (b) AUDITOR’S TRs.

An auditor’s TRs show up more quickly on a Correction List than anything else. 494 A pc ARC Broken by TRs 0 to IV will not read properly on a Correction List. NUMBERS OF LISTS The number of Correction Lists is large. It is unthinkable to do Word Clearing without ever using a WC Corr List. Yet we find folders with bogged Word Clearing sessions where the list was never used. There is the Green Form for general case upset, the Green Green Form for Solo, L1C for ARC Brks over a period, L3B for Dianetic bogs, L4B for listing and nulling goofs, Int RD Corr List for Int- Ext corrections, a Power Corr List for Power, GF 40R for resistive cases, C/ S 53 and Hi Low TA for TA misbehavior, L7 for Clearing Course, and others. C/ Ses trying to “solve cases” without using Correction Lists is like trying to repair flat tires without puncture patches- it just CAN’T BE DONE. THE PRIMARY TOOL OF A C/ S IS PREPARED CORRECTION LISTS. It is not inventive ways of “solving cases”. METHOD OF USE Where you have inexpert auditors you always order Method 5, which is just a full rapid assessment. Then the C/ S sorts out the reads and C/ Ses what to do as very well covered on the lists themselves and the C/ S Series. Then the auditor does the C/ S. A Green Form is always done this way. It will bog on any other method like 3. There are different methods of handling lists. L1C is always done Method 3, carrying each read as it is found Earlier Similar to F/ N. A GF 40R is done Method 3 and then the engrams are run for each read where engrams are indicated. It’s up to a C/ S to use Correction Lists, to coach his auditors into proper list use and to get corrected any misuse. A C/ S who can’t or doesn’t use Prepared Correction Lists isn’t a C/ S at all but a “person puzzled about cases”.

It is called Material Clearing. Those the person cannot define must be looked up. This method may be done without a meter. It can also be done with a meter. The reason the Method is needed is because the person often does not know that he does not know. Therefore Method 4 has its limitations as the meter does not always read. The actions are very precise. The word clearer asks “What is the definition of ?” The person gives it. If there is any doubt whatever of it, or if the person is the least bit hesitant, the word is looked up in a proper dictionary. This method is the method used to clear words or auditing commands or auditing lists. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH: nt. rd Copyright © 1972 by L.

According to HCOB 6 Dec 73, the make or break point of an auditor was his ability to get reads on a prepared list. This depended upon (a) His TR 1 and (b) His metering. In 1978 this was further studied and in HCOB 22 Jul 78 ASSESSMENT TRs, it was found that correct voice pitches had everything to do with assessment. I have just developed drills which improve this ability to make lists read and to improve an auditor’s auditing in general. These drills will also be found to have great value to people who do surveys, to Examiners and to Ethics Officers. E- METER To begin, an auditor should review his E- Meter drills and practice E- Meter Drill 27 on page 52 of the Book of E- Meter Drills, E- Meter Drill CR0000- 4 and, if found necessary, E- Meter Drill CR0000- 3. It is called to attention that"},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"E- Meter Drill 5 of the Book of E- Meter Drills has been replaced with E- Meter Drill 5RA and is not done, should be done. This E- Meter Drill 5RA is the only change in the original book. Further, it applies to the Mark VI just as well as it applied to the Mark V for which the book was written - the controls and actions of the Mark V and Mark VI are practically identical, though the Mark VI moves up to higher level cases. Being able to see and read and operate an E- Meter has everything to do with getting reads off a prepared list. Where an auditor misses it is simply that he has not adequately done the drills in the Book of E- Meter Drills and has not practiced up to a point of full, easy familiarity with the E- Meter. The point of being able to make lists read is pointless unless the auditor can set up, handle and read an E- Meter. But the skill is easily acquired. 499 ASSESSMENT TRAINING DRILLS The following drills have the letter “Q” after them to mean that they are used for QUESTIONS. The Q is followed by a number to show that they are drilled in that sequence. In these Q drills, the practice of twinning and any other TR tech normal to TRs is followed. TR 1- Q1 NUMBER: TR 1- Q1 NAME: Pitch of the Question. POSITION: Coach sitting at the keyboard of a piano or organ or any usable instrument, student standing beside instrument. PURPOSE: To establish the pitch differences of statements and questions. DATA TRAINING PROCEDURE: If the student is a girl, the coach asks her to say “Apple” as a statement. The coach then strikes the C above middle C (as given in the data above) and then the G above middle C. If the student is a man, the coach asks him to say “Apple” as a statement and then strikes middle C and then the F below middle C. This is repeated - saying “apple” and striking the two notes until the pitch of a statement can be duplicated by the student. In the event, the student has a voice pitch at variance with these notes, other notes can be found and used by the coach so long as the higher note is first and the second note is four or five whole notes below the first note. It must sound like a statement with the higher, then lower note.) Once the student has grasped this and can duplicate it, have the student use other two syllable words (or single syllable words preceded by an article), using these notes of the statement. Then, using these two notes, have the student make up sentences as statements, the bulk of the sentence said at the pitch of the higher note, but the end of the sentence at the pitch of the lower note. Once the student has this down and can easily do it and it sounds natural and he is satisfied that it does, go on to the question step. The coach has the student say “apple” as a question. Then the coach (for a male student) strikes the F below middle C and then middle C. For a woman the coach strikes the A above middle C and then the D an octave above middle C. (In case this does not agree with the voice pitch of the student, the coach must work it out providing only that the upper note is three or four whole notes above the lower note. It must sound natural and must sound like a question.) The coach has the student say “apple” as a question and then strikes the lower and higher note until"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"the student can duplicate it. Now take other two syllable words (or single syllable words preceded by an article) and have the student say these as a question, following each one with the two instrument notes, lower to higher. When the student can do this, is satisfied that it sounds natural and doesn’t have to think about dolling it, go on to the next step. Here the student makes up banal questions. The first part of the question is said at the lower note and the last part is said at the higher note. At each question, the coach strikes the lower note and then the upper note. When this sounds natural and the student does not have to think to do it and is satisfied with it, the drill is ended. END PHENOMENA: A person who can state statements and questions that sound like statements or questions. 500 HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard, April 1980, while doing the script for the soon to be produced training film “Tone 40 Assessment”. TR 1- Q2 NUMBER: TR 1- Q2 NAME: Walkabout Questions. POSITION: There is no coach. Two students separate and walk around their neighborhood and then meet and compare notes. The object is to detect personal habits in questioning. PURPOSE: To enlighten the student as to his own communication habits and people’s reactions to his questions. COMMANDS: The most common everyday social questions such as “How’s it going?” “Do you like the weather?”, etc. appropriate to the activities and circumstances of the person. Only one or two questions to a separate person. The questions must be banal, social and ordinary but they must be questions. TRAINING STRESS: The two students agree on the areas they will cover next time they will meet again. They then go over individually, not together. The student pauses next to people encountered and asks a social question, and notes the reaction of the person asked. In this drill the student does not necessarily try to use TR 1- Q1 but is just himself, speaking as he would normally speak. The students then meet and compare notes and discuss what they have discovered about themselves on the subject of asking questions. If they have not learned or observed anything, the drill must be repeated. END PHENOMENA: A person who has detected any habits he has in handling pitch of voice in asking questions so that he can cure these in subsequent drills. HISTORY: Recommended by L. Ron Hubbard in February 1978, in the pilot for HCOB 22 Jul 78 ASSESSMENT TRs. Developed into a TR in April 1980, by L. Ron Hubbard. TR 1- Q3 NUMBER: TR 1- Q3 NAME: Single Word Question. "},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"POSITION: Student and coach facing each other with a table in between them. The E- Meter is not used. The Book of E- Meter Drills used by student and another copy by coach. PURPOSE: To be able to ask questions using a single word read from a list. COMMANDS: The coach uses the usual TR directions of start, flunk, that’s it. The student uses single words from the prepared lists of the Book of E- Meter Drills, pages 66 to 72 of the Appendix. TRAINING STRESS: To get the student to use the pitch of his voice to deliver a question consisting of a single word. It must sound like a question per TR 1- Q1 and use similar pitch’s to TR 1- Q1. The student is flunked for out TR- l, for keeping his eyes glued to the list, for sounding unnatural. The student is also flunked for slow or comm laggy delivery or pauses. The coach designates the list to be used, changes lists. When the student can do this easily, a second part of the drill is entered and the coach begins to use the PC Origination List on Page 58 so as to interrupt the student and make him combine his questions with TR 4. In this case the student acknowledges appropriately, uses “I will repeat the Question.” and does so. 501 END PHENOMENA: The ability to ask single word questions that will be responded to as questions and to be able to handle pc origins while doing so. HISTORY: Developed in April 1980, by L. Ron Hubbard. TR 1- Q4 NUMBER: TR 1- Q4 NAME: Whole Sentence Questions. POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other across a table. The E- Meter is set up and used. Copies of the Book of E- Meter Drills are used. PURPOSE: To train the student to ask whole questions that sound like questions, read an E- Meter and handle a session at the same time. COMMANDS: The usual coach commands of TR drills. The Prepared Lists of the Appendix of the Book of E- Meter Drills; the questions in these drills are reworded so that the item occurs as the last word; Example: List 2, pg 65 or the Book of E- Meter Drills states that the Assessment Question is “which tree do you like best?”. This is converted, for each question, to “Do you like ?”; Prepared List 4 is converted to “Do you dislike ?”; etc. A whole sentence is used in every case. TRAINING STRESS: The usual TR commands are used by the coach. E- Meter Drill #5RA must be used to start. Any TR errors or Metering errors may be flunked, but special attention is paid to the student’s ability to ask a question that sounds like a question in accordance to TR 1- Q1 and that sounds natural. The drill has three parts. In the first part, although the coach is on the meter, the ability to ask the question is concentrated upon. The second part concentrates upon the student’s ability to look at the written question and then ask the coach directly without undue comm lag or hesitation. The third part is to do the first two parts and read the meter (in accordance with E- Meter Drills 27 and CR0000- 4 which may have to be reviewed if flubby) and to keep session admin, all smoothly and accurately. If a question arises about meter accuracy, a third person who can read a meter or a"},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"video tape is employed to ensure that the student is actually not missing or dubbing in reads. END PHENOMENA: A person who can do all the necessary actions of asking questions from a prepared list and run a session smoothly without errors or confusion’s and be confident he can. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in April 1980. TR 8- Q NUMBER: TR 8- Q NAME: TONE 40 ASSESSMENT POSITION: Same as TR 8 where the student is in one chair racing another chair on which sits an ashtray, the coach sitting beside the student in a third chair. A square four- cornered ashtray is used. 502 PURPOSE: To deliver the THOUGHT of a question into an exact position, wide or narrow at decision, that is a question, with or without words. COMMANDS: For the first part of the drill: Are you an ashtray? Are you made of glass? Are you sitting there? Second part of drill: same questions silently. Third part of drill: Are you a corner? to each corner of the ashtray, verbal and with intention at the same time. Fourth part of drill: Any applicable question, verbal and with intention at the same time put broad and narrow at choice into the ashtray, exact parts of it and the surroundings. TRAINING STRESS: The coach uses usual TR coaching commands. There are four stages to the drill. The first stage is to land a verbal command into the ashtray. The second stage is to put the question with full intention silently into the ashtray. The third stage is to put verbal command and silent intention at the same time into exact parts of the ashtrays The fourth stage is to put any applicable question both verbally and with intention into any narrow or any broad portion of the ashtray or its surrounds at choice and at will. At the conclusion of the whole drill imagine the ashtray saying “Yes, yes, yes, yes” in an avalanche of yeses to balance the flow (in actual life, people, pcs and meters do respond and return the flow). END PHENOMENA: The ability to land a question with full intention into an exact target area, broad or narrow, at will and effectively, whether verbally or silently. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in April 1980, as an extension of all earlier work on intention and Tone 40, as now applied to questions and assessments. TR 4/ 8- Q1 NUMBER: TR 4/ 8- Q1 (TR 4 for Pc Origin, TR 8 Intention + Q for Question, 1 for first part.) NAME: Tone 40 Assessment Prepared List Session Drill. POSITION: Student and coach sitting across from each other at a table, E- Meter set up and in use, session admin, using prepared lists. PURPOSE: To train a student to do all the actions necessary to a full, smooth, accurate session using prepared lists and to do Tone 40 Assessment of them. COMMANDS: Coach commands are the usual TR commands of start, flunk, that’s it. For the student, all commands relating to starting a session, giving an R factor, assessing a prepared list, keeping -the admin, indicating any item round and ending a session. The Book of E- Meter Drills for Prepared Lists as in TR 1- Q4. Origins for coach as per pages 58, 59 and 60 of that book. “Squeeze the cans”, “Take a deep"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"breath and let it out”, “This is the session”, “We are going to assess a prepared list” (assessment), “Your item is “ (indicate any F/ N) “End of Assessment” “End of Session”. TRAINING STRESS: Permit the student to continue to his first error, then have him drill and correct that error and continue. Finally, to conclude, let the student go through the entire sequence of the drill beginning to end three times without error or flunk for a final pass. It is expected that the student will not flub any TRs or metering or session patter. metering may be finally verified by a third student or video. All assessing must be in proper tone 40 with full intention exactly placed. The student must not wait to see if the meter read but catch the read of the last question as he starts the next one. His vision may shift from list to pc but at all times must embrace list, meter and pc. (This drill also would be the one used for tape or video passes as it includes all elements of metering and TRs.) 503 END PHENOMENA: A person who can do a flawless and productive assessment session, Tone 40. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard, April 1980. TR 4/ 8- Q2 NUMBER: TR 4/ 8- Q2 NAME: Listing and Nulling Tone 40 Assessment. POSITION: Same as TR 4/ 8- Q1. PURPOSE: To teach a student to do the action of Listing and Nulling with all metering and admin, using Tone 40 Assessment. COMMANDS: The usual coach TR commands. Two copies of the Book of E- Meter Drills. A prepared list is chosen by the coach and both use the same prepared list. The student reads the question and asks it and the coach reads the replies from the same list but in his own copy. The student must write down the answers in a proper session worksheet and note and write down any reads. (An F/ N terminates the listing if it occurs.) The coach need not use the whole list of replies but only half a dozen chosen at random. The sequence of commands is the same as TR 4/ 8- Q1 except that the R factor is “We are going to list a question.” And, if no item F/ Ns and no significant read has occurred, the additional action of nulling the list is undertaken with the command, “I will now assess the list.” TRAINING STRESS: The laws of Listing and Nulling HCOB l Aug 68 apply in full as these are very important laws and ignoring them can result in severe ARC breaks not so much in this drill but in actual sessions. The coach may also require suppress and invalidate buttons be put in on the whole list. All errors, omissions, hesitations and lapses from Tone 40 on the part of the student are flunked. Coach similarly to TR 4/ 8- Q1. Pass when the student can do it flawlessly three consecutive times. (This drill may be used for internship tapes and videos for assessing and metering passes.) END PHENOMENA: A person able to do a flawless L & N list as the session or as part of a session, with all TRs in, with perfect metering and proper admin and using"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"Tone 40 in his listing and assessing. HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in April, 1980. SUMMARY The purpose of these drills is to train the student to ask questions that will get answers and to assess prepared lists that will get accurate reads. If a student dolling these drills has difficulty it will be traced to false data, misunderstood words or not having passed earlier TRs including Upper Indoc or his metering drills as contained in the Book of E- Meter Drills. If a satisfactory result is not obtained, the faults in the above items should be located and remedied and these drills repeated. If any earlier omissions are found and repaired and if these drills are honestly done, heightened success as an auditor (or a surveyor or examiner or ethics officer) is assured. LRH: dr L.

LISTING AND NULLING IS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SUBJECT FROM ASSESSMENT. Please get these differences very clearly. They are completely different actions. They are even years apart in development. They have nothing to do with each other. ASSESSMENT Assessment is an action done from a prepared list. A PREPARED list. The list is prepared by the Auditor or the C/ S or it is an HCOB of prepared lists. It is done by someone other than the PC. The prepared list for an Assessment is not made up by the preclear. Assessment is done exactly per the Book of E- Meter Drills, Number 24. Assessment is NOT done by the Laws of Listing and Nulling. Assessment has nothing to do with S & Ds, Remedy A or Remedy B (which are Listing and Nulling actions). Assessment is not auditing. It is simply trying to locate something to audit. You say the words on the prepared list right to the PC’s bank, bang, bang, marking the reads, and go through the list of reading items until you are left with one reading item. That is the item. 505 "},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"To get a clue as to what happened, the C/ S prepares a list, and the Auditor starts assessing with the list already written out, The Auditor calls out each item and notes its read as follows: lions X Big Game SF Cats X Felines SF Tigers X Bearers X Trucks X Elephants X Killing Camping X Three items are now reading after the first assessment . The Auditor continues to assess the reading items on the list by elimination down to ONE item. On the second assessment the list looks like this: lions X Big Game SF X Cats X Felines SF X Tigers X Bearers X Trucks X Elephants X Killing F LFBD Camping X Now the item left in is “Killing”. It is circled. That is the item. The C/ S now knows where the charge lies. This item is prepchecked or done on an L1 as a subject or otherwise handled as directed by the C/ S. Sometimes some items will read three or four times, but the action is the same. The Auditor assesses the reading items by elimination down to one item. And that is all there is to it. If the item “killing” also had an F/ N, the item would not be handled further as the charge will have blown. 506 LISTING AND NULLING "},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"Listing and Nulling is an action whereby the PC gives items in answer to the Auditor’s listing question. It is the Preclear who lists. Listing and Nulling is listed by the preclear. This is done precisely per the Laws of Listing and Nulling. (HCOB 1 August 1968). There is no Listing and Nulling drill in the Book of E- Meter Drills. The Auditor asks the listing question, if it reads he asks the PC the question, the PC answers, item, item, item, item. The Auditor writes the items down as the PC gives them noting the read or no read as the PC gives the item. The Auditor then nulls the list per the Laws of Listing and Nulling. In Listing and Nulling, there should be ONLY ONE reading item on the list after nulling. You don’t go over and over the reading items by a process of elimination. You may extend the list if more than one item is reading on nulling. In its finest form, Listing and Nulling is done to LFBD F/ N. The Auditor says the listing question to the PC, checks whether it read and notes the reads per Number 6 of the Laws of Listing and Nulling. Ideally, the following would happens. The Auditor checks the question “Who got shot?” It gets a long fall, so it is reading well. Auditor writes the read beside the question. Then the Auditor gives the PC the question with good TR 8, and PC gives items. The Auditor writes the PC’s items down, noting whether the item read and the read as the PC gives it. The first reads therefore is always the read the item gave as the PC said it. “Who got shot?” LF Me X Joe X Bearers Elephants X Tigers The Buffalo X IND. The White Hunter LFBD F/ N Bearers F X Elephants F X Tigers F X 507 The Buffalo X X EXT The Dog X X IND The White Hunter LFBD LFBD F/ N"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":" “The White Hunter will BD F/ N because it is the item. The Auditor gives the item to the PC. The PC will have Cogs and VGIs. It might happen that the PC tells the Auditor that this is the item, at which point the Auditor would pleasantly say “thank you. ‘The White Hunter’ is your item.” of he could just smile and say “Thank you”, in acknowledgment. But the point is that he would never chop the PC’s Cog or enforce his presence on the PC while this is happening. GOOD TRs ARE VITAL. And this is the way you do Listing and Nulling. You get an LFBD F/ N while Listing or while Nulling, if you’re a flubless Auditor. It is the finest hand that gets it while Listing and never has to get to the Nulling stage. However, both are excellent. A list that has to be nulled to cm LFBD item is acceptable, but not worthy of praise. There is of course one other place where you could get an LFBD F/ N in Listing and Nulling - which is while checking the listing question for read before listing. You could get an F/ N on checking the question, and the PC could start cogging and blow the whole subject. When that happens, the subject has blown. Don’t do anything more with it. Indicate the F/ N and let the PC have his Cog and VGIs. Listing and Nulling is so simple. Have perfect TRs, know the Laws of Listing and Nulling, and do it as shown above. Any Auditor who consistently cannot get an LFBD F/ N while Listing and Nulling should retrain on Listing and Nulling. It is more than likely he’ll find he has bought some one else’s misunderstoods or considerations on the subject. As a matter of fact, Listing and Nulling is a breeze and don’t let anyone try to tell you otherwise.

If pc says it is a wrong item it is a wrong item. 6. The question must be checked and must read as a question before it is listed. An item listed from a non- reading question will give you a “Dead Horse” (no item). 7. If the item is on the list and nothing read on nulling, the item is suppressed or invalidated. 8. On a suppressed list, it must be nulled with suppressed. “On ....... has anything been suppressed.” 9. On an item that is suppressed or invalidated the read will transfer exactly from the item to the button and when the button is gotten in the item will again read. 509 10. An item from an overlisted list is often suppressed. 11. On occasion when you pass the item in nulling, all subsequent items will read to a point where everything on list will then read. In this case take the first which read on first nulling. 12. An underlisted and overlisted list will ARC break the pc and he may refuse to be audited until list is corrected, and may become furious with auditor and will remain so till it is corrected. 13. Listing and nulling or any auditing at all beyond an ARC Br without handling the ARC Break first such as correcting the list or otherwise locating it will put a pc into a “sad effect”. 14. A pc whose attention is on something else won’t list easily. (List and null only with the rudiments in on the pc.) 15. An auditor whose TRs are out has difficulty in listing and nulling and in finding items. 16. Listing and nulling errors in presence of Auditor’s Code violations can unstabilize a pc. 17. The lack of a specific listing question or an incorrect non- standard listing question which doesn’t really call for item will give you more than one item reading on a list. 18. You cease listing and nulling actions when a floating needle appears. 19. Always give a pc his item and circle it plainly on the list. "},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"20.

To continue the process beyond this point is Out Tech by the process being overrun and is also a violation of our basic Fast Flow System. Please note that whether there is a second leg to the process or not, like fitting an item found off a list into a bracket of commands, has no bearing on the fact that the process is flat.

The most violent session ARC Brks occur because of list errors under the meaning of listing and nulling. Other session ARC Brks even under withholds are not as violent as those occurring because of listing errors. Therefore when a violent or even a “total- apathy- won’t- answer” session upset has occurred in Dianetics, one must suspect that the preclear is reacting under the laws of listing and nulling and that he conceives such an error to have been made. The repair action is to assess the prepared list which corrects listing errors. This is L4BRA- HCOB 15 Dec 68 amended to 18 March 71. It is used “On Dianetics lists “ as the start of each of its questions when employed for this purpose. When a pc has not done well on Dianetics and when no other reason can be found the C/ S should suspect some listing error and order an L4BRA to be done “On Dianetic lists “ at the start of each question. Each read obtained on the list is carried earlier similar to F/ N as per HCOB 14 Mar 71 “F/ N Everything” or, preferably the list is found in the folder and properly handled in accordance with what read on L4BRA. Dianetic lists can be carried to an item that blows down and F/ Ns. This does not mean the item found is now wholly clean. Even though it F/ Ned it will in most cases need to be run on secondaries and/ or engrams (R3RA Quad) for erasure and full Dianetic end phenomena. (Ref: New Era Dianetics Series 1 through 18.) A C/ S must be alert to the fact that: (a) Extreme upsets and deep apathies are almost always list errors. (b) That a Dianetic list can be conceived to be a formal list and can behave that way. (c) L4BRA is the correction list used in such cases. (d) Laws of Listing and Nulling HCOB 1 August 1968 can sometimes apply to Dianetic lists."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":" Very few Dianetic lists behave this way but when they do they must be handled as above.

Such upsets also come from word clearing by incompetent persons. The C/ S should look for these especially when such campaigns are in progress. He should suspect them as a possibility when a case bogs. A C/ S must be sure all such papers and worksheets get into pc’s folders. A common repair action is to 1. Do an assessment for type of charge. 2. Handle the charge found by the assessment done. 3. Fly all the reading items found on such assessments by 2wc or direct handling. 4. Suspect LISTING ERRORS on any Why or purpose or product found even though no list exists and reconstruct the list and L4B and handle it. 5. Handle word clearing of any type in or out of session with a Word Clear Correction List done in session by an Auditor. 6. When word clearing is too heavy on the pc or doesn’t clean up suspect he has been thrown into implants which are mostly words or the words in some engram. As Implants are actually just engrams, handle it with an L3B. LISTING Any item found out of session or by a non- auditor is suspect of being a Listing and Nulling (L& N) error even though no list was made. TODAY A CORRECT L& N ITEM MUST BD AND F/ N. So treat such items as you would list errors and try to reconstruct the list and either confirm the item or locate the real item (may have been invalidated and suppressed) or extend the list and get the real item. 513 "},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"The real item will BD F/ N. One can establish what the situation is with a post purpose, a Why or a product or any other such item by doing an L4B. SELF AUDITING The commonest reason for self auditing is a wrong or unfound L& N item. People can go around and self list or self audit trying to get at the right Why or product or purpose after an error has been made. REACTION NOTHING PRODUCES AS MUCH CASE UPSET AS A WRONG LIST ITEM OR A WRONG LIST. Even, rarely, a DIANETIC LIST can produce wrong list reactions. Ask the pc for his somatics and he blows up or goes into apathy. Or blows. Or attacks the auditor. ALL of the more violent or bad reactions on the part of the pc come from out lists. Nothing else produces such d sharp deterioration in a case or even illness. OUT LISTS Therefore when one gets a sharp change in a case (like lowered tone, violence, blows, “determination to go on in spite of the supervisor”, long notes from pcs, self C/ Sing, etc., etc., the C/ S SUSPECTS AN OUT LIST. This outness can occur in regular sessions even when the item was said to BD F/ N. It can occur in “Coffee shop” (out of session auditing of someone), or by Est Os or poorly trained or untrained staff members or even in life. PTS When such actions as finding items by non- auditors are done on PTS people the situation can be bad, so one also suspects the person to be PTS to someone or something. “PTS” does not communicate well in an assessment question so one says, “Someone or something is hostile to you” and “You are connected to someone or something that doesn’t agree with Dianetics or Scientology.” 514 REPAIRS The main things to know when doing such repairs are (a) that such situations as wrong lists or upset people can occur in an org where untrained people are also using meters and (b) THAT IT IS UP TO THE C/ S TO SUSPECT DETECT AND GET THEM HANDLED IN REGULAR SESSION. Do not ignore the possible bad influence. As the good outweighs the bad in such cases, it is not a correct answer to forbid such actions. It is a correct answer to require all such actions and worksheets become part of the folder. One can also persuade the D of T or Qual to get in the people doing such actions. And do not ignore the effect such actions can have on cases and do not neglect to include them in C/ Ses before going on with the regular program. They can all be repaired. L.

It really is simple if you know your Laws of L & N. VERIFYING A LIST The correct procedure for verifying/ correcting past L & Ns is to check the items as to whether or not they are correct. Then do an L4BRA on each list where the item is found to be incorrect. You would have to orient the pc to the listing question and the item. You do not direct the question to see if it read. And don’t just do an L4BRA and then not find the right item for the pc as part of the handling (unless the question proves to be uncharged or some such). NULLING A LIST One nulls a list when he doesn’t get a BD F/ N item on listing. The Laws of L & N strictly apply. An L4BRA would be used if the action bogs with still no item found. One would also null lists the pc made where no item had been found such as a 2WC which turned into a listing action with the pc giving off items or a list the pc somehow made while not on a meter. In these cases there is no item to verify with"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"the pc as correct. Just cull the items into a list, work out with the pc what the question was if it’s not already noted, and null the list. RECONSTRUCTING A LIST Sometimes you just don’t have the list and can’t get it or it’s an old Why Finding or PTS interview for which there are no worksheets. In this case you get from the pc what the question was and then get him to give you the items that were already on the list as the item probably was already on the list and you don’t want the pc to get into newly listing the question in PT and then getting into an overlisting situation. Just get him to give you the items he had already put on the list and more often than not you will get a BD F/ N item. If you don’t get the item that way then you can extend the list. SELF- LISTING Watch it on these as every random stray thought a person has about “why this or that” does not mean it’s a self- list. But do look for it on a person who is manifesting the horrendous BPC an out list can generate, who is introspected or has been trying to figure out who is doing him in after just having seen the Ethics Officer. Just don’t get into trying to make a list out of some nonstandard listing question that won’t give you an item. And actually the usual reason for self- listing is a prior wrong L & N item or an item not found. People will self- list to try to find the right item. So find and correct the earlier out list. 517 LIST CORRECTION BLOW- UP When you are going along correcting lists and suddenly you get a big pc blow- up and it is not resolving on the list you are correcting you had better quickly realize that you probably are not correcting the list that is out and you’d better find out which list it is. There is usually an earlier out list to be found, if the list you are correcting does not resolve the upset. LISTS NOT READING When you start getting key lists such as Grades III and IV not reading and no items found it’s time for that auditor to get a thorough overhaul on his metering, eyesight and to get off all his MUs on L & N. You also could be setting the pc up for a self- listing situation as he has been given the listing question but no item has been found. So be very sure the question did not read even with Suppress and Inval and TRs were in before getting off a key L & N process. USE OF L4BRA The prepared list L4BRA corrects L & N lists. It can be run on old lists, current lists, general listing. When a pc is ill after a listing and nulling session or up to 3 days after, always suspect that a listing action done on the pc had an error in it and get those lists corrected. Sometimes it is obvious what the error was per the Laws of Listing and Nulling. For example there could be two reading items left on the list in which case you would know to extend the list as it has been underlisted. If this didn’t go, then an L4BRA would be done on the list. HANDLING AN L4BRA"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" You handle reading questions on the L4BRA by the directions under the question that read. You don’t just 2WC these questions. For example say question 4 read on the L4BRA, “Is a list incomplete? SF.” You then ask the pc, “What list is incomplete?” Locate it and get it completed to a BD F/ N item. You don’t just 2WC “incomplete lists” to an F/ N and leave it at that. By the way the L4BRA is missing a line which is “Was it the first item on the list?” This is being added as it’s quite common that it is the first item and is most often missed. DO IT RIGHT An out list can create more concentrated hell with a pc than any other single auditing error. So it’s imperative that listing errors get properly corrected. The best thing to do is to have the Laws of Listing and Nulling drilled line by line and down cold and just do it right in the first place. Then you will also see at once where old lists violated these laws and you will not be yourself doing lists that have to be corrected later. L.

It is a science which has exact rules. Foremost in the rules is: DON’T USE A LISTING QUESTION IN TWO WAY COMM. By a “listing question” is meant any question which directly or indirectly calls for items in the pc’s answer. Use of “who”, “what”, “which” instantly turns a TWC into a listing question. Listing questions are governed by the rules of Listing and Nulling. If you use a listing question accidentally in TWC you can get the same bad reactions from a pc that you would get on a wrongly done list. The reason for pc upsets in TWC is hidden as it is not apparently a listing process, rarely gets the correction a bad list would get. Asking “who” or “what” or “which” during a TWC after the main question can also turn it into a Listing and Nulling process. TWC questions MUST be limited to feelings, reactions, significance’s. They must NEVER ask for terminals or locations. EXAMPLE: “Who upset you?” in TWC causes the pc to give items. This is a LIST. “What are you upset about?” does the same thing. “Which town were you happiest in?” is also a LISTING question NOT a TWC question. Any of these results in the pc giving items. They are not then nulled or correctly indicated. The pc can get VERY upset"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"just as he would with a wrong list. Yet the session is not a “listing session” so never gets corrected. EXAMPLE: “How are you doing lately?” is an example of a correct TWC question. It gets off charge and gets no list items. “Are you better these days than you used to be?” “How have you been since the last session?” “What happened” is different than “What illness”, “What person”, “What town” which are listing questions. REPAIR When other things fail to locate the upset of a pc look into TWC processes in the folder and treat them as L& N processes where the pc has answered with items. The relief is magical.

There are many such lists- Green Form, LIB, L4, etc. They are available in HCO B form and are themselves corrected and re- issued from time to time. They can be found in HCO B 5 July AD 13 and others. There are FOUR WAYS TO USE these prepared lists. 1. The auditor starts at the top and takes up each read until he gets one to F/ N. In this case the auditor does not do “Itsa earlier Itsa”. He just cleans each read. 2. The auditor starts from the top and on each read cleans it and does Itsa earlier Itsa to F/ N or to a clean no- read and goes on. 3. The auditor assesses the list down until he gets a heavy read and cleans that, using Itsa Earlier Itsa. Then he can go on to the next heavy read, cleans that. Etc. to F/ N. In this case he can get several F/ Ns on the same list. 4. The whole list is rapidly assessed over and over until one item stays in and that is given to the pc. UPSET PC When a pc is very upset and misemotional the action in 4. above is the only one to use as it is the safest. On a very upset or antagonistic pc don’t engage in any chatter, just grab a list and assess it, and indicate the By- Passed Charge. The results are usually magical.

An L& N List is always done on a separate sheet. It’s best to do an L& N List on faint- lined paper. The pc’s name and date are put on the top of the sheet. The listing question is written out, usually before the start of session. When the listing question is checked the read is marked by the question (sF, F, LF, LFBD). If Suppress or Inval is used that is also noted. As each item is given by the pc the reads are marked- sF, F, LF, LFBD. This is done AS YOU LIST. If the item does not read you mark it with an X. TA is noted periodically as the pc lists, and especially when the TA rises. The LFBD F/ N item is circled. If indicated to the pc it is marked IND. When extending a list a line is drawn from where it has been extended with the date. Example: Item Joe X Shoes sF Socks X ________________ Ext 24.2.72 Sky X Wax X Pigs etc. etc.. 523 L& N Lists are never stapled to the W/ S but are paper- clipped under the session reports.

The corrected lists are left with the session reports of the session in which they were corrected. A note in red is made in the F/ S of this correction.

Cognition’s are the milestones of case gain. Rough TRs, rough metering, Out Code and a distractive auditor then make no case gain. When an auditor has smooth, usual TRs, does his metering expertly and without attracting the pc’s attention, when he follows the Auditor’s Code (particularly regarding Evaluation and Invalidation) and when he is interested, not interesting as an auditor, the pc cognites and makes case gains. Further, according to the axioms, a bank straightens out by AS- ISING its content. If the pc’s attention is distracted to the auditor and meter his attention is not on his bank so AS- ISING cannot occur. The definition of In Session is INTERESTED IN OWN CASE AND WILLING TO TALK TO THE AUDITOR. When this definition describes the session in progress, then of course the pc will be able to AS- IS and will cognite. By “The Original Thesis”, the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pc’s bank. When the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"greater than the pc. It is this situation which gives a pc a low Tone Arm. An auditor who can’t be heard, doesn’t ack, doesn’t give the pc the next command, fails to handle origins simply has OUT- TRs. The auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc, who over- acks, who laughs loudly, is putting the pc’s attention onto himself. So the pc’s attention, not being on his bank, doesn’t as- is or cognite. The auditor whose metering by- passes F/ Ns or calls F/ Ns at wrong points, or who tells the pc “That reads” “That blew down” etc., or who any other way uses the meter distractingly (the pc knows when he is being under or over run and knows when he is being mismetered), is of course violating the definition of IN- SESSION. The pc’s attention goes to the meter, not his bank, so he doesn’t AS- IS or cognite. 530 Auditor Invalidation and Evaluation is just plain villainy. It interferes with pc cognition’s. Other Code breaks are similarly distractive. A PERFECT SESSION If you understand the exact definition of IN- SESSION, if you understand the pc’s necessity to have his attention on his bank so as to AS- IS it and work out what is really going on in a session that brings about a cognition (as- ising aberration with a realization about life), you will then be able to spot all the things in TRs, metering and the Code that would prevent case gain. Once you see that out- TRs, mis- metering and Code breaks would PREVENT the IN- SESSION definition you will see what would impede a pc from AS- ISing and Cogniting When you have this figured out you will then be able to see clearly what are IN- TRs, CORRECT METERING and CORRECT CODE APPLICATION. There can be an infinity of wrongnesses. There are only a few rightnesses. Recognition of Right TRs, right Metering and right Code use depend only on (a) Understanding the principles in this HCOB, and (b) Their practice so as to establish habit.

If the solo auditor is so all- thumbs with his papers, meters, platens that they distract him from his own bank he is not likely to as- is or cognite. Recently, on Flag, we have taken failed IIIs and put them back through a full heavy re- train on R6EW and then pushed them back up the line with good success. When a solo auditor is also a rabbit (runs from everything including his bank) he has no chance to overcome it if he is all thumbs with his tools. Requiring arduous, perfect drills on Solo metering and auditing actions at R6EW level should occur before the pc sees any materials. He must first and foremost be a Solo Auditor, familiar with his meters and papers to such a degree that they do not in any way distract him. Only then can you add a bank to the scene. A poor solo auditor does not cognite as his attention is on the tools not his bank. Where the Solo auditor fails, he has not learned his tools. The remedy is to make him learn them. The bridge between II and III is sometimes a hard one. It may be that an HDC course is vital before the pre- can make this bridge. The Solo Auditor who “attests” rather than confront his bank probably never learned to use his auditing tools in the first place. Then, adding the bank as something to confront results in confusion. Cognition’s in Solo Auditing depend upon the ability to use the tools of auditing so well, they serve no distraction in Solo Session. L. RON HUBBARD FOUNDER LRH: mes Copyright © 1971 by L.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMM CYCLE IN REGULAR AUDITING AND CYCLES OF ACTION IN SOLO AUDITING References: HCOB 26 Apr 71 I TRs AND COGNITION’S HCOB 26 Apr 71 II SOLO COGNITION’S HCOB 30 Apr 71 AUDITING COMM CYCLE There is a difference between regular auditing (where the auditor and pc are two separate persons), and Solo auditing. One does not have to be skilled in Auditor’s TRs 0- IV in order to be a good Solo auditor . A Solo auditor’s skills are covered in HCOB 26 Apr 71 II, SOLO COGNITION’S. TRs 0- IV and the Auditing Comm Cycle apply to regular auditing where the auditor and pc are two separate people. The idea that a Solo auditor would have to mock himself up as “the auditor” and mock himself up as “the pc” is erroneous. Nor does the Solo auditor have to try to be two different. people, nor does Solo auditing consists of “talking to oneself”. In order to understand Solo auditing better, read and demonstrate each of the following definitions until you understand each of them: Auditing Comm Cycle: “This is the auditing comm cycle that is always in use: 1) is the pc ready to receive the command? (appearance, presence); 2) auditor gives command/ question to pc (cause, distance, effect), 3) pc looks to bank for answer (itsa maker line, 4) pc receives answer from bank, 5) pc gives answer to auditor (cause, distance, effect), "},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"6) auditor acknowledges pc, 7) auditor sees that pc received ack (attention), 8) new cycle beginning with (1)” (HCOB 30 Apr 71 AUDITING COMM CYCLE) Auditing Cycle: The basic of auditing is an auditing cycle which operates as an attention director. Call it restimulator if you want, but it’s an attention director, eliciting a response from the pc to as- is that area and who knows he has done so when he receives from the practitioner an acknowledgment that it has occurred. That i~ the auditing cycle. “ (SH Spec 189, 6209C18) 2. “There are basically two communication cycles between the auditor and the pc that make up the auditing cycle. They are cause, distance, effect with the auditor at cause and the pc at effect, and cause, distance, effect, with the pc at cause and the auditor at effect . These are completely distinct one from the other. “ (HCOB 23 May 71R IV, Rev . 4 .12 . 74 Basic Auditing Series 4R COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN THE AUDITING CYCLE ) Communication Cycle: 1. “A cycle of communication and two- way communication are actually two different things. A cycle of communication is not a two- way communication in its entirety. In a cycle of communication we have Joe as the originator of a communication addressed to Bill. We find Bill receiving it and then Bill originating an answer or acknowledgment back to Joe and thus ends the cycle.” (DIANETICS 55! page 82) . “A communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect with intention, attention, duplication and understanding. “ (HCOB 23 May 71R IV, Rev. 4 .12.74 Basic Auditing Series 4R COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN THE AUDITING CYCLE Cycle of Action: l. “The sequence that an action goes through, where in the action is started, is continued for as long as is required and then is completed as planned.” (Scientology Abridged Dictionary ) 534 (The definitions above are taken from the Technical Dictionary.) In Solo auditing the Auditing Question or Auditing Command is provided in the materials. The Solo auditor has to ensure that he understands the Auditing Question or Auditing Command, gets the answer to the question or carries out the command, and recognizes that he has done so and completes that cycle. Solo auditing mainly consists of carrying out cycles of action. This is easy to do as these are given in the materials, and it consists of doing what the materials say to do. VERBALIZATION The Solo auditor does not verbalize questions or commands in solo auditing. It is done on a thought or intention level. There is a solo auditing action in which the Solo auditor calls items verbally, but otherwise solo auditing is not verbalized. METER ERROR In Solo auditing the meter, worksheets and materials must be arranged so that the solo auditor can read the meter at the same time as he reads the question or item in the materials. This is because the question or item will read on the meter when the solo auditor reads the question or item in the materials. One should not ignore the meter read when first reading the question or item in the materials. This is especially true when checking reads on Ruds, or doing a BPC Assessment, as the read might not repeat. The initial read when the question or item is first read and understood by the Solo auditor is taken. This is because the read occurs when the"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"Solo auditor thinks the question or concept of the item. Another meter error could occur if the Solo auditor didn’t understand the question or item. You could get a reaction because the question or item was misunderstood. And if the question or item is misunderstood, then you wouldn’t be able to audit it. Therefore it is very important that the Solo auditor knows to clear the meanings of words in auditing commands and items. SOLO DRILLS The Solo Drills are designed to familiarize the Solo auditor with the tools of Solo auditing, and to become skilled so that when the time comes to start Solo auditing, he can put his full attention on the auditing and thus be fully in session.

SOLO AUDITOR DRILLS (Reference: The Book of E- Meter Drills HCOB 9 Jul 80 CHECKLIST FOR SETTING UP A SOLO SESSION. ) These Solo Auditor Drills replace what was formerly called “Solo Auditors TRs”, which tended to train a Solo auditor into the idea of “talking to himself” or verbalizing everything in Solo auditing and that is incorrect. These drills are to train a Solo auditor to be able to do the Solo auditing actions he will encounter on Solo levels. These do not teach one to be able to audit pcs, nor do they try to teach Auditor’s TRs, (If you want to learn to be an auditor, take the Auditor’s Hard TRs Course and Academy and SHSBC training.) If done thoroughly and until you can do each drill easily, you will be able to Solo audit very successfully. These Solo Drills are done with a meter, worksheets, auditing table and Solo can setup as these would be in a Solo session. SOLO AUDITOR DRILL 1 NAME: SOLO CAN DRILL PURPOSE: To train a Solo auditor to take Tone Arm readings with two cans and with Solo can, and do a proper can squeeze on a one- hand electrode. POSITION: Solo auditor seated at an auditing table with meter, cans and a copy of HCOB 9 Jul 80 CHECKLIST FOR SETTING UP A SOLO SESSION and HCOB 14 Jul 70 SOLO CANS. The coach sits beside the student. TRAINING STRESS: HCOB 9 Jul 80 CHECKLIST FOR SETTING UP A SOLO SESSION and HCOB 14 Jul 70 SOLO CANS are used as references. The coach has the student set up the meter, measure his TA reading with two cans and note it on the worksheets per HCOB 14 Jul 70 SOLO CANS. The coach then has the student change over to a Solo can set"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"up and adjust TA and note it on the worksheet. (TA notations are to be done as shown in HCOB 14 Jul 70 to differentiate between 2 can and Solo can readings.) The coach has the student do this part of the drill until the student can do it easily and rapidly. 540 The coach then has the student squeeze the can for sensitivity setting, and adjust the sensitivity knob until the needle goes from “set” to the left hand line of “Test” on can squeeze. Do this drill until the student can do it easily and without flub. SOLO AUDITOR DRILL 2 NAME: SETTING UP A SOLO SESSION PURPOSE: To train a Solo auditor to be able to set up for, and end off a Solo session. POSITION: Coach and student beside a card table (auditing table) with a chair, legal length paper, Mark VI E- Meter, cans, two ball- points, pocket stapler, correction lists and materials and an insulator (such as a sheet of plastic) handy. TRAINING STRESS: HCOB 9 Jul 80 CHECKLIST FOR SETTING UP A SOLO SESSION is used as a reference. The coach has the student set up a solo session exactly per HCOB 9 Jul 80. Steps 1- 51 of the checklist are drilled until the student can easily and rapidly set up a solo session, and end off a solo session. (NOTE: The student Solo auditor is to set up the materials for the session and use these in the remaining drills.) SOLO AUDITOR DRILL 3 NAME: SOLO METERING PURPOSE: To train a Solo auditor to read written material and note whether the meter read. POSITION: The student Solo auditor seated at a table set up for a Solo session, with a copy of Book of E- Meter Drills. The coach is seated beside the student where the coach can also see the meter and worksheet. TRAINING STRESS: The student Solo auditor sets up the meter and Solo can and keeps a worksheet as in Solo Drill 1. Then turns to one of the Prepared Assessment Lists in the back of the Book of E- Meter Drills. He then places the list where he can see the list and the needle. He places a blank piece of paper over the list covering everything but the first item on the list. The Solo auditor then reads the first item on the list and notices if the meter reads on the item. He continues down the list moving the blank piece of paper as he goes. When a read occurs, the Solo auditor informs the coach of the item that read and what the read was. He then writes the item and it’s read on the worksheet. He also notes the time and TA position. The coach verifies that the student has done all of this correctly. Then the coach has the student continue doing the drill. Various assessment lists are used in this manner until the student can perform the actions of reading written material and noting if it reads and recording this on a worksheet. The coach’s job is to encourage the student and keep him at it until he can do it easily. SOLO AUDITOR DRILL 4"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":" NAME: CLEARING WORDS 541 PURPOSE: To train the Solo auditor to clear the meanings of words in auditing questions or commands. POSITION: The student Solo auditor seated at a Solo auditing session set- up (per Solo Drill 2), and the coach seated beside the student so that the coach can also see the meter and worksheets. A copy of HCOB 13 Oct 79 CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING is placed on the table where the student Solo auditor can read it, and see the meter needle. TRAINING STRESS: The student Solo auditor is to read the HCOB and note when the meter reads, find and clear the misunderstood word to F/ N and keep worksheets. The Solo can and Solo session set- up is used. The coach ensures that the student Solo auditor does all of these actions. After this HCOB is word cleared, another bulletin is used (it doesn’t matter which bulletin). This drill is done until the Solo auditor can do it easily, and keep worksheets and operate the meter. (Although the student may be fumbly at first, the coach helps the student and encourages him until the student has mastered it.) SOLO AUDITOR DRILL 5 NAME: SOLO CYCLE OF ACTION PURPOSE: To train a Solo auditor in carrying out cycles of action in Solo auditing to completion of that cycle, and to end cycle on it. POSITION: The Solo auditor seated at a table set up for a Solo session with the coach seated beside him. The student has a copy of the Book of E- Meter Drills opened to E~ 20. TRAINING STRESS: The student Solo auditor uses the list of questions given in EM20. (The word “your” in the questions is changed to “my”, and the word “you” is changed to “I”.) The student Solo auditor writes the question down on the worksheet, changing the wording as above, and notes whether the question read on the meter. Then he silently answers the question and writes down the answer. Then he acknowledges that that cycle is complete. The coach then verifies that the student did each step and whether the student is satisfied that he has done so. This drill is passed when the student can carry out this cycle without being distracted or Q & Aing, does complete the cycle started and ends the cycle. (The questions, answers and acknowledgments are done silently and conceptually, not verbalized.) _____________ The student Solo auditor now does the following Solo E- Meter drills. The Solo session set- up, Solo cans are all used as in preceding drills, and the student writes on a worksheet. This is to keep familiarizing the Solo auditor with the tools he will be using in Solo auditing. The student must have completed the regular drills per the Book of EMeter Drills before attempting these drills. If the student Solo auditor has difficulty with a drill done Solo, he should return to the appropriate Solo Auditor drill, or to the regular meter drill until he can do it easily. The numbers within the drills are the numbers from the Book of E- Meter Drills. The Solo E- Meter Drills are done silently. "},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"Drills 1 to 7 are exactly as given in the Book of E- Meter Drills and are not repeated here as a Solo action. Also use HCOB 14 Jul 70 SOLO CANS for proper use of Solo cans. 542 SOLO E- METER DRILL 8: As for EM- 8 except that student has the bulletin on the table beside the meter. He holds the electrodes (Solo cans) himself and observes the meter while reading the bulletin. SOLO E- METER DRILL 9: As for EM- 9 except that student auditor holds Solo cans and reads bulletin. Considerable emphasis is on correct positioning of the meter, worksheets, and reading material early in this drill. The student should experiment with these positions for optimum placement so as to see the meter at the same time as reading and to avoid session distractions. SOLO E- METER DRILL 10: As for EM- 10. Additional notes as for previous drill. SOLO E- METER DRILL 11: As for EM- 11 with student holding Solo cans and reading silently from origination sheet. E- METER DRILL 12: Omitted as a Solo drill. E- METER DRILL 13: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E- METER DRILL 14: As for EM- 14 but with student holding Solo cans and reading bulletin. SOLO E- METER DRILL 15: As for EM- 15 but the student holding the Solo cans and reading origination’s to himself and thinking the meaning of the origination conceptually. Coach asks: “What did the needle do while reading the line?” etc., as in the basic drill. In this drill the student learns that the meter read will occur when he reads the line and gets the concept, and trains the student to be able to read a line and note the meter reaction or lack of it, at the same time. Not read the line and then look at the meter later. It also trains the student that if he has his attention locked on the meter and doesn’t actually think the meaning of the line, the meter won’t read. SOLO E- METER DRILL 16: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E- METER DRILL 17: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E- METER DRILL 18: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E- METER DRILL 19: As for EM- 19, but with the student Solo auditor holding the solo cans and the coach seated beside him, observing. The drill is done silently. The coach is to keep the student at it and asks commands as per EM- 19 until the student can do it easily and with certainty. 543 SOLO E- METER DRILL 20: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E- METER DRILL 21: As for EM- 21 but student auditor holding Solo cans. In this drill done Solo the student auditor will of course already know what he was"},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"thinking when the meter read. However, the drill is done as given to show the Solo student auditor that his thought will again produce the same read when he again thinks the same thought. It also illustrates the necessity for the Solo auditor to keep his attention on the reading item or subject in order to keep that item reading and further, when the thought is repeated it shows how the read on that thought will diminish and vanish as the charge is reduced by re- spotting the original thought. Therefore in the Solo drill there is a second step where the student is required to repeatedly think the same thought until the read no longer occurs and to note the reads on a worksheet as they occur. As this is an auditing technique used in certain Solo levels when discharging items the drill must be well done and continued to a high level of competence. SOLO E- METER DRILL 22: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E- METER DRILL 23: Omitted as a Solo drill.

(Re- revised to add Solo Student C/ Ses that, will give CASE WINS as well as practice solo sessions.) (Revisions Not in Script) STANDARD C/ S INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SOLO STUDENT AUDITOR REF. HCOB 30 JAN 82 C/ SING SOLO STUDENT AUDITORS This bulletin, with its Attachments, is for use in conjunction with the auditing section of The New Hubbard Solo Auditor Course (HCO PL 28 January 82 Issue II). The standard C/ Ses on the Attachments, while primarily training actions, are also designed to start the Solo Student Auditor on his solo auditing at the correct gradient. The Solo C/ S is not limited to these Solo Student C/ Ses. Solo Student Auditors will make good gains from these actions. The main emphasis, however, must be on their use as training actions for the student as a Solo auditor, to ensure he is using the exact and correct session procedure, keeping proper session admin and doing a competent job of basic auditing. They provide him with a foolproof gradient for “getting his feet wet” when he begins to solo audit, while giving him experience in running a standard Solo session by the book. 548 The C/ Ses are issued to the student auditor one C/ S at a time, and each C/ S is checked out on the student before he does the action. Should the student auditor flub any action, he is crammed on the materials and drills covering that action before he audits further. Each action is repeated until the student can do it successfully with no flubs. It is the responsibility of the Solo Student Auditor, the Solo Supervisor and the Solo C/ S to ensure the actions are not skimped. The success of the Solo Auditor on advanced levels will depend upon the certainty and competence he achieves on these student auditor actions. The Solo Student C/ Ses from No. 8 on, are designed to give the Solo Student Auditor both increased confidence and CASE WINS! A supply of these Standard C/ Ses should be mimeoed in quantity and made available to the Solo Case Supervisor. The mimeoed C/ S that applies is then selected and given to the Solo Student Auditor as his actual C/ S for each session. L.
