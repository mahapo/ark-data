He can see how the subject progressed and so isable to see which are the highest levels of development. Not the least advantage in thisis the defining of words and terms for each, when originally used, was defined, inmost cases, with considerable exactitude, and one is not left with any misunderstoods.”—L. Ron HubbardThe first eight volumes of the Technical Bulletins of Dianetics and Scientologycontain, exclusively, issues written by L. Ron Hubbard, thus providing a chronologicaltime track of the development of Dianetics and Scientology. Volume IX, The AuditingSeries, and Volume X, The Case Supervisor Series, contain Board Technical Bulletinsthat are part of the series. They are LRH data even though compiled or written byanother.So that the time track of the subject may be studied in its entirety, all HCO Bshave been included, excluding only those upper level materials which will be found oncourses to which they apply. If an issue has been revised, replaced, or cancelled, thishas been indicated in the upper right-hand corner along with the page number of theissue which should be referred to.The points at which Ron gave tape recorded lectures have been indicated as theyoccurred. Where they were given as part of an event or course, information is given onthat event or course on the page in the chronological volumes which corresponds to thedate. The symbol “**” preceding a tape title means that copies are available from bothPublications Organizations.

Auditing Over Out Ruds.All changes are in this type style. )AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR C/SesAn auditor who receives a Case Supervisor direction (C/S) of what to audit on apc is NOT discharged of his responsibility as an auditor.THE AUDITOR HAS A SERIES OF RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE PARTOF EVERY C/S HE GETS TO AUDIT.ACCEPTING THE PCNo auditor is required to accept a specific pc just because the pc is assigned tohim.If an auditor does not believe he can help that particular pc or if he dislikesauditing that particular pc the auditor has a right to refuse to audit that pc. The auditormust state why.The Case Supervisor, Director of Processing or Director of Review, nor any oftheir seniors, may not discipline the auditor for refusing to audit a particular pc.An auditor who refuses to audit his quota of hours or sessions is of coursesubject to action.Thus refusing to audit a particular pc, so long as one is not refusing to audit otherpcs, is not actionable.“I do not wish to audit this pc because______. I am willing to audit other pcs,” isthe legal auditor statement in the matter.Some pcs get a bad name with some auditors, some don’t appreciate the auditing,some conflict with a particular auditor’s own personality. There are such instances. Itdoes not mean certain pcs cannot be helped by others.It is also true that an auditor who dislikes a pc may not do a good job so the rulealso has a practical side to it.One auditor disliked young men and did a bad job on them. Another disliked oldladies and chopped them up in session. One pc had messed up several Scientologistsand couldn’t find anyone to audit him at all.We are not auditing people to make amends to the world.Thus an auditor has a right to reject or accept the pcs he is given.1"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ACCEPTING A C/SWhen the auditor gets a C/S to do on a case and if he thinks it is not the correctthing to do he has the right to reject the C/S for that pc and require another one he canagree to.The auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/S and change it during thesession except as noted below.The auditor may NOT C/S in the auditing chair while auditing the pc. If he hasNO Case Supervisor at all the auditor still audits from a C/S. He writes the C/S beforesession and adheres to it in session. To do something else and not follow the C/S iscalled ‘‘C/Sing in the chair’’ and is very poor form as it leads to Q and A.STALE DATED C/SA C/S that is a week or two old or a Repair (Progress) Pgm that is a month or twoold is dynamite.This is called a “Stale Dated Pgm’’ or a ‘‘Stale Dated C/S” meaning it is too old tobe valid.It should have been done sooner. The pc of last week when the C/S was writtenmay have been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches andreprimand from the boss.It is dangerous to accept a Repair (Progress) Pgm if it is old.The auditor who sees his C/S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justifiedin demanding a fresh C/S giving his reasons why.A program written in January may be completely out of date in June. Who knowswhat may have happened in between.Use fresh C/Ses and fresh Pgms.Stale Dates only occur in poorly run backlogged Divisions anyway. The realremedy is reorganize and hire more and better auditors.ENDING THE SESSIONWhen the C/S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the auditor has aright to end the session and send the folder to the C/S.Ending the session is totally up to the auditor.If the auditor just doesn’t complete an action that was producing TA and could becompleted it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic engram the onemore time through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena.This and similar actions would be an auditor error.The judgement here is whether or not the auditor’s action is justified in ending thesession.Even though he may have made an error, the auditor cannot be blamed for theending off of the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for theerrorAUDITING OVER OUT RUDSAuditing a pc on something else whose ruds are out is a MAJOR AUDITINGERROR.2"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Even if the C/S omits ‘‘Fly a rud” or “Fly ruds” this does not justify the auditorauditing the pc over out ruds.The auditor can do one of two things: He can Fly all ruds or he can return thefolder and request ruds be flown.The DIANETIC AUDITOR is not excused from auditing over out ruds and in anHGC must be specially cautioned not to do so but return the folder for a new C/S.Better still he should learn to Fly ruds.INABILITY TO FLY RUDSIf an auditor cannot get a rud to F/N, cannot get any rud to F/N, he is justified instarting a Green Form.The auditor solution to no F/N on ruds is to do a GF whether the C/S said to ornot.This is an expected action.It is understood the auditor would use Suppress and False in trying to Fly ruds.SESSIONS FAR APARTWhen a pc has not had a session for some time, or when a pc gets sessions daysapart, RUDS MUST BE FLOWN. Otherwise the pc will get audited over out ruds.This can develop mental mass.Optimum session scheduling is a series of sessions or a whole program done in ablock of sessions close together. This prevents the world from throwing the pc’s rudsout between sessions.Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbedin patching life up.Rapid gain gets above life’s annoyances and keeps the pc there.UNREADING ITEMSWhen an item the auditor has been told to run doesn’t read on the meter, evenwhen the auditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the auditor MUST NOT doanything with the item no matter what the C/S said.It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it. And if itstill doesn’t read he will be expected NOT to run it.LISTSWhen an auditor whose C/S told him to list “Who or what______” or any listquestion finds that the list question does not read, the auditor MUST NOT list it.When doing a list ordered by the C/S it is assumed that the auditor will test it forread before listing and that he will NOT list an unreading question. (A read is an actualfall, not a tick or a stop.)LIST TROUBLEWhen an auditor has trouble doing a list and getting an item it is expected he willuse a Prepared List like L4B to locate the trouble and handle it.As it is very hard on a pc to mess up a list it is expected the auditor will handle thesituation then and there with no further C/S directions.3"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"HIGH TAWhen the auditor sees the TA is high at session start yet the C/S says to “Fly arud” or run a chain, the AUDITOR MUST NOT TRY TO FLY A RUD and he must notstart on a chain.Trying to bring a TA down with ARC Brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARCBreaks aren’t the reason TAs go up.Seeing a high TA at start the Dianetic auditor or Scn auditor up to Class II doesnot start the session but sends the folder back to the C/S and for a higher class auditorto do.Seeing a high TA at start the Scientology auditor (Class III or above) (a) checksfor exteriorization in a recent session and if so the session is ended and the C/S is askedfor an “Interiorization Rundown”; (b) if the pc has had an Interiorization Rundown theauditor asks the C/S for permission to do a “C/S Series 53’’ or a Hi-Lo TA assessmentor whatever the C/S indicates. The Int RD may have been (usually is) overrun andneeds rehab or correction and it is usual to check it—it is included in a “C/S 53’’ and aHi-Lo TA.These actions are expected of the auditor even when not stated in the C/S.GOING ON HOPINGWhen a case is running badly session to session the LAST thing you do is go onhoping, either in auditing or C/Sing.“Let’s try _____”, ‘‘Then this”, “Then this”, is not going to solve the case.YOU GET DATA. You can get data by a White Form (Pc Assessment Form).You can get data from a GF fully assessed (Method 5). You can get data by 2-waycomm on various subjects. You can have the D of P interview and get answers. Youcan even ask his mother.You look for case errors. You study the folder back to where the pc ran well andthen come forward and you’ll find the error every time.DO NOT JUST GO ON SESSION AFTER FAILED SESSION HOPING.That’s pure idiocy.You get data! from prepared lists, from life, from the pc, from the folder.FIND THE BUG!Ah, good Lord, he is a Pinkerton Agent sworn to secrecy! He does yogaexercises after every session. He was tried for murder when he was 16 and nobody hasrun the engram of it.Various auditors ran the same engram chain four timesAn auditor ran Int RD twice.After Power she had her baby and nobody ran the delivery.He doesn’t like to talk but is a “Grade Zero”!A dozen dozen reasons can existAn auditor does NOT let a C/S C/S hopefully. He refuses the C/Ses until a FolderError Summary is done and the bug found.4"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"THINGS DONE TWICEBy carelessness the same rundowns can be called for twice and done twice oreven more.A Folder Summary inside the front cover must exist and must be kept up.Over it there must be a program on which the case is being audited. But justbecause it’s covered, never neglect entering a session and what was run on the FolderSummary (FS).If Hold it Still is ordered, see if it was run before.Don’t let major Rundowns be done twice.DIANETIC ITEMS must NEVER be run twice. Dianetic lists must not bescattered through a folder. Bring them together and keep them together and beingbrought forward.COPYDon’t copy Dianetic lists or worksheets from notes or items from lists.Keep all admin neat and in the original form.Copying makes errors possible.RUDS GOING OUTWhen the ruds go out during the session the auditor recognizes the following:Pc Critical = W/H from auditorPc Antagonistic = BPC in sessionNo TA = ProblemTired = Failed Purpose or no sleepSad = ARC BreakSoaring TA = Overrun or ProtestDope Off = By-passed F/N or not enough sleepNo Interest = Out Ruds or no interest in the first place.An auditor who isn’t sure what it is but runs into trouble with the pc (except onlists which he handles at once always) is smart to end off the session quickly, writedown the full observation and get it to the C/S.The auditor who is an old hand and knows what he is looking at as per abovescale (and the C/S the C/S would give) handles it promptly.Pc Critical = W/H = pull the W/H.Pc Antagonistic = BPC = assess proper list (such as L1 C) and handle.No TA (or case gain) = Problem = locate the problem.Tired = no sleep or Failed Purpose = check which it is and handle.Sad = ARC Brk = locate and handle, Itsa earlier Itsa.Soaring TA = O/R or Protest = find which and handle. Such an O/R is usually byrehab.Dope Off = lack of sleep or BP F/N = check on sleep, or rehab F/N.5"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"No Interest = no interest in first place or Out Ruds = check for interest or put inruds.List goes wrong = BPC = handle or do L4B or any L4 at once.Ruds won’t fly = some other error = assess GF and handle.The auditor has no business trying to do the C/S given when it collides with andisn’t designed to handle any of the above.If the previous session disclosed such an error and this session C/S was designedto handle and doesn’t, the auditor should end off and the next C/S should be “2-waycomm for data”.CASE NOT HANDLEDWhen the auditor or the Examiner collides with a pc who is asserting his case hasnot been handled, there should not be a new set of actions based on little data but theauditor should end off and the C/S should order a “way comm on what hasn’t beenhandled”.The auditor should not at once take this up as part of any other C/S.In other words an auditor doesn’t change the C/S to a 2-way comm on somethingnot called for by C/S.MAJOR ACTIONSAn auditor should never begin a major action on a case that is not “set up” for it.As this can occur during a session it is vital to understand the rule and follow it.Otherwise a case can be bogged right down and will be hard to salvage as now a newaction to repair has been added to an unrepaired action. Now, if the auditor starts amajor action on a case not “set up” we get 2 things to repair where we only had I as themajor action won’t work either.Repair = patching up past auditing or recent life errors. This is done by preparedlists or completing the chain or correcting lists or even 2-way comm or prepchecks onauditors, sessions, etc.Rudiments = setting the case up for the session action. This includes ARC Brks,PTPs, W/Hs, GF or O/R listing or any prepared list (such as L1C, etc).Set up = getting an F/N showing and VGIs before starting any major action. Itmeans just that—an F/N and VGIs before starting any major action. Such may require arepair action and rudiments as well.Major Action = any—but any—action designed to change a case or generalconsiderations or handle continual illness or improve ability. This means a Process oreven a series of processes like 3 flows. It doesn’t mean a grade. It is any process thecase hasn’t had.Grade = a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examinedand attested to by the pc.Program = any series of actions designed by a C/S to bring about definite resultsin a pc. A program usually includes several sessions.The vast bulk of auditing errors come about because C/Ses and auditors seek touse a Major Action to repair a case.It is a responsibility of an auditor to reject a C/S which seeks to use one or moremajor actions to repair a case that isn’t running well.6"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The auditor must understand this completely. He can be made to accept a wrongC/S for the pc and even more importantly can in his own session make the error andmess up the case.Example: Pc has not been running well (no real TA or had a grumpy Examreport). Auditor sees C/S has ordered a major action, not a repair by prepared lists,ruds, etc. The auditor must reject the C/S as he will be made to fail in session by it.Example: Auditor gets a C/S, “(1) Fly a rud; (2) Assess LX3; (3) Run 3-wayrecall, 3-way secondaries, 3-way engrams on all / / X items”. The auditor can’t get arud to fly. Does the LX3. In other words he flunks by failing to SET UP the case. Itcould also go this way. Auditor can’t get a rud to fly, does a GF, gets no F/N. HeMUST NOT begin a major action but MUST end off right there.It is fatal to begin any new process on the case designed to change the case if thecase is not F/N VGIs.The pc who starts processing for the first time and is surely not F/N VGIs mustbe set up by repair actions! Simple rudiments, life ruds, O/R list on life, even assessingprepared lists on life, these are repair actions. The pc will sooner or later begin to fly.Now at session start you put in a rud, get F/N VGIs and CAN start major actions.So the auditor has a responsibility not to be led up a garden path by a C/S whichorders a major action on a pc who isn’t repaired or by not being able in session to getan F/N VGIs by repair.The only exceptions are a touch assist or life ruds or the Dianetic assist all on atemporarily sick pc. But that’s repair isn’t it?PROGRAM VIOLATIONSWhen an auditor receives a C/S and sees that it violates the pc’s program heshould reject it.The pc, let us say, is supposed to finish his Dianetic Triples but is suddenly beinggiven a Group Engram Intensive. That violates the program and also the grade.If the pc is running badly, a repair should be ordered. If not, the program shouldbe completed.Example: An effort is being made to get the pc to go backtrack. This is a programcontaining several major actions which probably consists of several sessions. Beforethis program is complete and before the pc has gone backtrack, the C/S orders “(1) Flya rud, (2) 3 S & Ds”. The auditor should recognize in 3 S & Ds a major action beingrun into the middle of a program and reject it. The correct action is of course the nextbacktrack process.GRADE VIOLATIONSA pc who is on a grade and hasn’t attained it yet must not be given major actionsnot part of that grade.Example: Pc is on Grade I. C/S orders a list having to do with drinking. It is not aprocess on that grade. It could be done after Grade I is attained and before Grade II isbegun. The C/S is incorrect and should not be accepted.ABILITY ATTAINEDNow and then before the full major action is complete or before all the gradeprocesses are run, the pc will attain the ability of the grade or the end phenomena of theaction.7"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"This is particularly true of valence shifters or Interiorization Rundowns and canhappen in grades.The auditor should recognize it and, with the F/N VGIs always present at suchmoments, end off.I know of one case who had a huge cog about Interiorization on Flow I Engramsand was pushed by both C/S and auditor to do Flows 2 and 3 who bogged so badlythat it took a long while—weeks—to straighten the case out.The ability itself gets invalidated by pushing on.On the other hand this should never be taken as an excuse. “I think he cogged tohimself so we ended off.” It must be a real “What do you know!” sort of out-loud cogwith a big F/N and VVGIs and directly on the subject to end off a major action or aprogram or a grade before its actions are all audited.REVIEWING REVIEWSAn auditor who gets a C/S or an order to repair a case that is running well shouldreject doing the action.I have seen a case ordered to repair who had Ext Full Perception Doing Great.The repair bogged the case. The case then got running well again but a second C/Sordered a new repair which of course bogged it. Then major actions were done. Thecase was again repaired and rehabbed and became ok. Three times the auditor shouldhave said NO.FALSE REPORTSThe vilest trick that can be played on a pc is for an auditor to falsify an auditingreport.It may be thought to be “good Public Relations” (good PR) for the auditor withthe C/S.Actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk.INTEGRITY is a hallmark of Dianetics and Scientology.Just because psychiatrists were dishonest is no reason for auditors to be.The results are there to be gotten.False reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the auditor and pc.OVERTS ON PCSWhen an auditor finds himself being nattery or critical of his pcs he should get hiswithholds on pcs pulled and overts on them off.An auditor who goes sad is auditing pcs over his own ARC Break.An auditor worried about his pc is working over a Problem.Getting one’s ruds in on pcs or C/Ses or the org can bring new zest to life.AUDITORS DON’T HAVE CASESIn the chair no auditor has a case.If breath shows on a mirror held to his face he can audit.8"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Faint afterwards if you must but see that the pc gets to the Examiner with his F/N.Then get yourself handled.“WHAT HE DID WRONG”An auditor has a right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong.Most often a sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this HCO Bhave been violated.But an auditor’s TRs can go out or his listing and nulling is in error.After a session that went wrong somebody else (not the auditor) should ask the pcwhat the auditor did. This sometimes spots a false auditing report. But it alsosometimes is a false report by the pc.In any event, the auditor has a right to know. Then he can either correct hisauditing or his know-how or he can advise the C/S the pc’s report is untrue and betterrepair can be done on the pc.Savage action against an auditor is almost never called for. He was trying to help.Some people are hard to help.Not only does an auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must begiven the exact HCO B, date and title, that he violated.Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCO B or tape.Don’t be party to a ‘‘hidden data line’’ that doesn’t exist“You ruined the pc!” is not a valid statement. ‘‘You violated HCO B page____” isthe charge.No auditor may be disciplined for asking, ‘‘May I please have the tape or HCO Bthat was violated so I can read it or go to Cramming. “If it isn’t on a tape, a book or an HCO B I T IS NOT TRUE and no auditor has toaccept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data.“If it isn’t written it isn’t true’’ is the best defense and the best way to improveyour tech.These are the rights of the auditor with relation to a C/S. They are all technicalrights based on sound principles.An auditor should know them and use them.If an auditor stands on these rights and gets beaten down he should put all thefacts before his nearest OTL or SO ship as something would be very wrongsomewhere.Auditing is a happy business—when it is done right.LRH:nt jhL.

The earliest of these Charts was 1965 followed by 1stDecember 1966 followed by 1st January 1968 followed by 1st December 1969. Thereissues of the Chart are done to improve the communication of the data on the Chart.The program factor has not much changed since its earliest issue. Tapes about this Chartwere made for the SHSBC at its first issue and of course remain valid. The processescalled for on the Chart are all part of the SHSBC or for upper levels part of the SH andAO Confidential materials. From time to time they are reissued but they remain standardand have been so since the first issue of the Chart.The Chart and its materials have now and again been neglected or disregarded andTHE NEGLECT HAS RESULTED IN FIELD FLAPS AND DOWN STATS.Omitting this gradient of processes not only stalls cases but results in a casemanifesting out-grade phenomena.A pc must attain the full ability noted on the Chart before going up to the next levelof the Chart.Telling the pc he has made it is of course evaluation.The outnesses which have occurred surrounding this Chart are hard to believe. Theyconsist of total abandonment of the Chart, degrading and losing all its lower gradeprocesses, feeding a pc at Dianetic level data at Class VI and telling him, who has notmade Dianetics yet, he is now Clear, cutting down all processes from the Chart bottom upto IV to be able to do them in 2l/2 minutes, neglecting all levels up to OT V and thentrying to put in a few lower grades and sending on to OT VI, having the pc after onetrivial session attest all abilities at once and many other errors.This is crazy driving. If a bus were driven along a road this way it would soon bewrecked and back where it started but in an ash heap.Genius in C/Sing is normally required only when some former driver wrecked thething instead of driving it right in the first place.To Case Supervise one has to accept the following facts:1. Dianetics and Scientology work.2. The subjects are serious subjects not experimental toys.3. The basics and fundamentals are stated early in the period of development and havenot changed.10"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"4. The “newest and latest” is usually a recovery of basics and better statements ofthem.5. The purpose of the subject has not altered and continues to be the attainment ofability and freedom for the individual.6. That things which were true early in the subjects are still true.7. That the mind responds on a gradient of improvement not suddenly like a bombexplosion.8. That the Classification and Gradation Chart and all its processes and steps IS thebasic program of any case.9. That all other programs are efforts to get the pc or pre-OT back on the basicprogram.10. That there is no hidden data line and that the materials and procedures are refinedmainly to facilitate use and communication of them.11. That auditing is for the pc, not the org or the auditor.12. That major processes are done to improve the case.13. That repair is undertaken to eradicate errors made in auditing or the environmentwhich impede the use of major processes.14. That a case has to be programmed by the C/S to get it advancing as it should havebeen in the first place on the Classification and Gradation Chart.15. That a C/S is not being called upon to develop a new Chart for the case but only toget the case back on the basic Chart and get it done.3 PROGRAMSThere are then 3 types of Programs:1. THE program laid out in the Classification and Gradation Chart. (Called The BasicProgram.)2. Repair Programs to eradicate case mishandling by current life or auditing errors.(Called a Set-Up Program.)3. Major actions to be undertaken to get the case back on the Class Chart fromwherever he has erroneously gotten to on it. (Called a Return Program.)It has been a very common C/S action to disperse away from a program laid out.This has been happening ever since the first issue of the Class Chart and has been aprincipal source of trouble for C/Ses.This happens in several ways:1. Not knowing the importance of the Class Chart.2. Not knowing basics.3. Falling for SP propaganda that “we don’t use that now”, “the material is old”,“it’s only background data”, etc, that deteriorates what one does know and coulduse.4. Failure of auditors to give good sessions and do the Usual required in a session.5. Abandonment of the C/S’s own Repair or Return Program—usually because offalse auditor reports or operating on insufficient data from the pc.The correct way to go about all this is to:11"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"A. Repair the case thoroughly with minor actions like GFs, prepared lists, ruds, two-waycomm.B. Acquire adequate data on the pc.C. Complete any C/S Return Program begun.D. Get the pc back on the Class Chart without any processes of the grade skipped.E. Run the case on the Class Chart.F. Repair any departures or errors made in life or auditing.G. Get the pc back on the Class Chart.DISPERSALNot following any program is a complete exercise in non-sequitur (means one stepdoes not follow the last but is different and unrelated).In giving a pc process after process that are not related to each other and follow noRepair Program or Return Program is non-sequitur in the extreme.If processes were remarks one would get a sequence of processes given the pcsounding like this. “The submarine just went by so we will order a hundred tons ofbread. There wasn’t any beer so birds are seldom seen. The dance was very fast so wefixed the carburetor. He has very long hair so we decorated his father’s tomb.”“Give pc Scn Triples then do his Dianetics then fix up his hidden standard,” wouldbe a series of crazy non-sequitur C/Ses. Nothing is connected to or proceeds fromanything. That would be a dispersed program for sure.It actually happens horribly enough. Study a Class Chart and then look throughsome old folders. At once, the sequence of processes ordered sounds like “Thesubmarine just went by so order a hundred tons of bread.”Such C/Sing has no cause and effect in it. A person totally ignorant of basic causeand effect gets “Pc nattery. Run Dianetics.” “Pc’s case not advancing. Do Grade 0.”The cause of the pc condition is not understood. A nattery pc has withholds. A case notadvancing has problems. That’s real actual basic tech (see Auditor’s Rights HCO B forthe table). This data is over 15 years old at this writing, is part of proper Academy coursesand the SHSBC and is even in Class VIII materials. The reasons for the pc’s behavior ortrouble are not mysterious reasons never revealed. They are all very well given in coursematerials.Here is an actual case, a folder I examined of a pc who is now in trouble andneeding a Repair and Return Program.Pc was an accident prone (person who is apparently dedicated to having accidents).Very low aptitude score (about 30). Had been skipped over almost the entire Class Chartand given Power.To handle accident proneness was given CCHs. This cured it.Had Exteriorized so was given Interiorization Rundown without a 2-way commsession.Pc subsequently developed bad somatics. (Dianetics was never flattened orcompleted.)A quarter of an inch of Examiner’s reports wherein the pc was asking for help ormedicine to get rid of somatics was then put one by one into the folder.Despite this the “C/S” saw “Va” on the pc’s folder and ordered R6EW.More Examiner’s calls collected.The pc ran one item, making one mark on a worksheet and attested R6EW.12"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"More Examiner’s reports collected, pc reporting self ill.“C/S” seeing R6EW attested ordered pc to Clearing Course.Pc did one brief session attested Clear.More Examiner’s reports into folder, pc in pain and now in Ethics trouble.“C/S” ordered pc to OT I.Pc spent 35 minutes on OT 1 in terror of it, hastily attested, had 5 accidents in 3days.Folder sent to me as a “baffling case”.So the correct actions now have to be taken.1. Repair pc with every list known to Man or Beast to get off BPC collected in theseoverwhelming levels.2. Repair pc in errors in current life.3. Return Program the pc by running simple things, 2-way comm, to give pc somewins in actual case gain by maybe handling by 2-way comm minor this life orchildhood upsets with family, maybe putting in ruds on some early subject thatturns up.4. Put pc back on the Class Chart TO COMPLETE THE INCOMPLETE GRADE(Dianetics) to its full end phenomena as per Class Chart.5. Bring the pc on up the Class Chart using all processes for each grade and honestlyattesting each grade in turn.It’s all a shame because the pc had a lose on status. She wanted to be Clear and OT,was actually on it and never walked up the stairs to get to it.PROGRAM NECESSITYOne can see from all this the NECESSITY of working by program on a case.Even when one starts an honest program for the case one can get thrown off of itand begin to do something else.If the pc goes exterior, of course, one has to handle by Interiorization Rundownbefore the case can be audited at all. But that’s no reason to then skip all the grades! A pccan go exterior at any point. Thus it must be handled when it occurs. But that does notmean anything happened to one’s program or the Class Chart. Exterior or Interior, a pcunflat on Dianetics (not attained the ability marked on the Class Chart) is unflat onDianetics!And a pc who is unflat on Dianetics will have out lower grades.Jumping processes on the Class Chart set the pc up to fall on his head later. An“OT VI with problems” is really just an unflat Grade I. And until Grade I is flattened topermanent Ability Attained on the Class Chart, he remains an unflat Grade I.A C/S who gets wound up in this sort of skipped everything and made nothing, ofcourse has an awful mess on his hands. He can feel as lost as Hansel or Gretel. But waitingto get covered up by leaves is for the birds.If one finds the pc off the road, the thing to do is return the pc to the road at thepoint he didn’t walk it AND THERE ARE NO SHORTCUTS FOR THE MIND.The utter despair and insane barbarism psychiatry descended into was patient lost,psychiatrist lost, patient crazy, psychiatrist into insane sadism.So maybe the first lesson a C/S really has to learn is:13"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THERE IS A KNOWN ROAD OUT.There is no shortcut, it has to be walked every inch of it.And therefore the greatest enemy of the C/S is the SP who says “that’s all old”“we don’t use that now” “that’s just background data” and thereby obscures the actualroad.And another enemy is the pc who screamingly demands to be put up to Clear atonce so he won’t have this awful headache!STEADY ONThus the measures a C/S takes to hold a steady course will profit him greatly in theend with good solid gains for the pc.As the pc should no longer be a total humanoid by Class IV the lower grade gainsare the most important of all.A C/S who puts a Class Chart into every folder he handles is doing a wise thing.Even if it’s big, clumsy, hard to handle, it is at least thorough.If on it he marks in red things the pc has gotten to falsely and if in green things thepc made from the bottom walking an honest road, he knows where he is at! Seeing thewhole training cycle half of the Chart continue blank means that much more ignoranceand trouble for the pc in making his gains stably.If the C/S put his Repair Program on a Red sheet in the folder and dated it outsession by session to be audited until it was DONE and all flubs made in doing it alsomarked in and repaired, the C/S wouldn’t lose his place in the book. For a red sheetstands out in amongst other folder papers. A red sheet with a “folder error summary” onone side of it and the C/S’s Repair Pgm on the other keeps the pc’s progress located.When that Red sheet is done it should be signed by the C/S as DONE which retires allerrors to that point.A bright blue sheet giving the C/S RETURN PGM properly dated also gives one achance to not get steered off. A new Red Repair Pgm sheet fixing up errors occurring indoing the Blue sheet can be pushed into the folder but the Blue sheet can be resumedagain.The Blue sheet completed should find the pc back on the Class Chart.A list of processes run tallied up by the auditor each session keeps the C/S fromrepeating a process and gives him the Dn items used singly to be done triple.While all this Admin may seem time consuming, lack of it mounts up into valuableAUDITOR TIME being thrown away.------------C/Sing is a road. It has milestones. When the pc didn’t pass one honestly he got lost.There’s no reason for pc, auditor and C/S to all get lost.The C/S has an exact road to hold to, return to and repairs to get done so the pc canget moving on the Return Pgm and the Class Chart which IS the road.It took too many trillions to find this road for it to be neglected. For if the C/Sneglects it people won’t arrive anywhere but get lost as well.The right idea is the road.LRH:kjm.rdL. RON HUBBARDCopyright ©1970Founderby L.

Delay in Repairing a goofed session.There have been several examples recently of pcs ending session with an unflatprocess after which the repair session was delayed for several days or even weeks andthe pc came down with a cold or had some minor accident or got in Ethics trouble.Thus Repair has priority.PROGRAM ERRORSUnder A. a major error in programming lays the case open to having goofedsessions and exposes the auditor to some risk of making errors. The reason for this isthat the pc gets overwhelmed or bogged simply by not coming up through all theprocesses of each level on the Class Chart.Let us say the pc is trying to make it on R6EW Solo Study but keeps havingProblems with it and can’t get on with it.The uninformed C/S orders a Student Rescue Intensive. This is all right as far asit goes. But a more searching look into the records is likely to find that this pc hadexactly 10 minutes on the whole of Grade I!The Out-Program is far more likely to play havoc with this pc than just problems.He is possibly in doubt as to case gains and his reality is poor and yet he is beingexposed to the highly restimulative materials of an upper level to which he has neverclimbed.A direct effort now to put in problems Grade I also puts an auditor at risk.Instead of merely being able to run problems as he would have been able toearlier, the pc is in some sort of overwhelm and is nervous or scared or believes he is atfault some way. He will look everywhere but in the right direction.The answer to an incorrectly programmed case is, of course, a repair program andthe sooner the better.Such repair programs must be very light. Prepared lists to find charge, 2 waycomm on various subjects, take a walk. And such a repair program MUST NOT(a) Let the pc dive into rough heavy charge, or15"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"(b) Be overdone to total boredom.SELF AUDITINGSome pcs “self audit”, which is different than Solo auditing since it has no meteror session and is just wandering about the bank (some overwhelmed pcs self audit inSolo wandering all over the place).This is a symptom of session or study or life overwhelm.It requires a Repair Program.EP OF REPAIRThe End Phenomena of a Repair Program is the pc feeling great and feeling hecan get Case Gain.A good, clever Repair Program produces what badly programmed cases wouldconsider total recovery.It is a good idea to have the pc attest to“I have had definite gains from the recent sessions and feel great.” Or with ahearty “Yes” to “Does Scientology really work for you.”Oh, you say, how could that much gain come from just repair?Well, Repair is almost always being done on a pc who was overwhelmed by lifeor auditing in the first place.Life we know has a way of overwhelming people.When a person is overwhelmed by life, an auditing error is more likely to occur.When Incorrect Programming occurs, then any auditing on it can add up to moreoverwhelm which adds up to more errors.CONSISTENT COMPLAINTThe pc whose Examiner forms routinely have a sour note in them should not becontinued on the Class Chart or any Return Program.He is a Repair pc and nothing else.If you get the idea that any lower level can produce large changes in a person youwill see that lower level processes are being mis-programmed if they are producingonly the gains of Repair actions.The sign of mis-programming is most often seen in Examiner reports where thepc’s comments or demands are “for more auditing” or “Got to have a session” or“wasn’t really handled” or sour comments or cracks.When you examine some folders you will see some pc has more than his share ofthis.That’s a sign to LIGHTLY DO IT.The wrong way to go is plunge!16"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"I have seen a C/S order 2 major actions in one session after a bad session on a pcin a DESPERATE effort to reach the case!The exact reverse is required.Repair the case by:I. Patch the session goof.II. Use prepared lists for locating session charge in past sessions.III. Use prepared lists and two way comm on items found.IV. Get ruds in on periods of the pc’s life.V. Get ruds in on parts of the pc’s body that are ailing.This is not a model Repair Program but only a sample of one. It isn’t a modelbecause the pcs have different things wrong with them.But you could blindly do all of the above and still wind up with case gain and awin for a staggering pc.Then you would do a Return Pgm to get the pc back on the Class Chart. But notuntil then.I have seen a pc stagger along for years getting auditing (of a sort) while stillretaining a set characteristic or somatic who when handled with very mild processeshad a case gain and then returned to the Class Chart HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGEOF THE CHARACTERISTIC.EFFECT SCALEA C/S can get into the lower end of the effect scale and feel that desperate that hebegins to throw away every major process he can order on the pc, even 2 or 3 persession! But the direction of win was LIGHTER not heavier action.Sort of like “this sparrow keeps getting bowled out with rocks. Let’s try realartillery on him!”If one is trying to make a better sparrow he should lay off the rocks and lighten itup, not step up the barrage! Some cotton tufts might do wonders! Might even make thesparrow reach!The basic trouble with ALL past efforts at “psychotherapy” and “religious uplift”and “self betterment” and healing was:The more desperate the situation the more desperate was the remedy used.The right answer is:THE WORSE THE CONDITION THE LIGHTER THE REMEDY REQUIRED.Dealing with psychotics in an institution you would find that “Hello” pleasantlysaid would do more for cases than all the drug firms and electric shock machines andbrain icepicks have ever done in all their existence.Well if it applies to psychotics, it applies surely to people that aren’t.Simple interest and listening can crack an awful lot of overwhelmed cases thatwould only bog further if not first repaired.17"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"BPCThe exact BPC of the last session handled is always the first action in RepairProgramming.This is the exact BPC. An unfinished Dianetic Chain is BPC. So get it handled.The wrong list item is heavy BPC so get it handled.And get this BPC off now! Now! Don’t wait 2 days or a week. Repair it onpriority.OVERWHELMDon’t always blame the auditor. He may goof and he shouldn’t. But if hisprocedure and TRs were reasonably correct, how come the pc got a tangled session.If the auditor has a usually good record and you get a goofed session, then realizethe pc is a bit troublesome and was not running standardly.Of course this doesn’t excuse student goofs or plain lousy auditing. But when theauditor does all right, then the case must be in an overwhelm of some sort.So we have 2 variables here for C/S decision.x1-Auditor fault?orx2-Pc in an overwhelm?There is a decision here to be made by the C/S. It’s resolved by folder inspectionand knowledge of the auditor.All right—Auditor usually okay. That eliminates x1. So we have a pc inoverwhelm? Look over past record of pc. Runs okay. That cancels x2.So we repair that one session and its goof and continue with the Return Pgm orthe Class Pgm whichever the pc was on.What if x1 showed lots of bad sessions by the auditor and x2 showed pc usuallyokay. Investigate auditor’s auditing and send to Cramming for TRs, etc.What if x 1 Auditor okay and x2 pc has lots of trouble?NOW we get to an overwhelmed pc.You see how it’s sorted out by the C/S?From inspecting two things only the C/S can decide what’s to be done now. If thedecision isn’t clear-cut get the auditor looked into and the pc asked about the auditor’sactions and his own case. If his “case has lots of trouble” skip worrying the auditorfurther unless that discloses other errors on other cases.Okay. So the pc is running badly. So he’s in an overwhelm.Inspection will reveal one or more of three things.1. Case didn’t come up the Class Chart right.2. Case being run in a temporary Life overwhelm.18"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"3. Former errors not repaired.1 and 3 may both exist.The correct C/S action is a Repair Program in any case. If 3 is true you engage inthat first.If 2 is true you use Repair actions on life as the second part of your RepairProgram.If 1 is true you will also have a Repair Program to lay out first in any event andjust include it in.Write it all up on a red sheet and follow the sheet session by session as you C/S.You will now have handled the overwhelm if your Repair Pgm is good and fullydone and not brushed off at the first sign of VGIs in the pc at Examiner.If 1 is true you now do a Return Pgm. This of course is what processes you’regoing to get run to fill in the processes that haven’t been run to get the Class Chart alldone and the pc back up to where he was. He has run some after all.INGENUITYThe genius and bright ideas of a C/S are not exerted with major processes ever.Only the Interiorization Rundown after the pc exteriorized or when it is discovered hehas and possibly a Student Rescue or a sickness assist are the exceptions to this.One doesn’t Repair with major processes! That’s like “The engine wouldn’t runso he hit it with a sledge hammer.”Ingenuity is required of a C/S only in the area of repair.Locating BPC is rather standard in repair action.But fishing up the case by 2 way comm and little prepchecks and getting in rudson things or times require a certain flair in a C/S.I recall one pc who was staggering on engrams, couldn’t talk to people and was ageneral mess. The wrong action would be to run a major grade like Comm on the pc.The pc had to be handled with 2 way comm of some sort. Yet she couldn’t talk auditingor anything else fluently enough about anything to clear anything up. I asked her whatwould it be awful to say and she went scarlet, hemmed and hawed and blurted out“Swearing!” So we 2 way commed about it! What a torrent! Recovered completely.Recovered so well she thought that was all there was to auditing and was immenselygratified!Another pc had lost his job and couldn’t face any part of it. I 2 way commed whathis job had consisted of. He promptly went out and got another.Sometimes it takes a lot of sessions and a lot of reading worksheets to findsubjects.BUT IF YOU CAN PERSUADE AUDITORS TO MARK EVERY FALL ANDBD IN 2 WAY COMM SESSIONS you will find exactly where the pc is hung up andordering 2 way comm on that and related things does wonders.But all repair isn’t two way comm. Touching things is a very good way to handlerepairs. Cars, typewriters, airplanes, or book pictures thereof or anything or anypicture of anything also works.19"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The “touch assist” is a little fragment of a whole array of “touch”.Cases sometimes flinch at remembering anything at all. The answer is touchthings and “Reach and withdraw” is part of this and is used in repair.TRs (all of them 0 to IX) are so good in repair action that they actually cure 50%or more drug addicts when run for weeks in groups such as on the HAS Course. It iseven reported that when run on people still on drugs over periods of weeks they comeoff the drugs of their own volition. TRs are a fine unlimited repair action.Prepared lists run on all sorts of things can repair a whole life.“Look at me. Who am I?” is used in a Repair Session when a pc goes too wild toaudit. (An exception is list errors when the only remedy is a fast L4A.)Mimicry is actually too high for Repair.Repair is its own subject.The only demand in Programming it is to give priority to recent auditing errors orrecent life catastrophes.Many cases obviously have to begin processing with a Repair. Life overwhelm isthe reason. And an S & D can be far too steep.Next to skimping lower grades, Repair is too little used.And it is needed. And the urgency is to not let things go too long unrepaired.

Step by stepthese increases in ability walk up the Class Chart and ability is the measure of progress.The C/S who is looking for THE solution to a case, the one shattering bang oftotal effect on the pc, has set himself for continuous losses in C/Sing. For there is noone action that totally changes a case from bottom to top in one fell swoop. The C/Swho thinks there is continually fiddles hopefully. A case has MANY things to behandled, not one.There is no one single wrongness or out-point in a case. A case is a collection ofout-points. He hurts, he can’t talk, he has problems, he is ARC Broken, he has servicefacs, he is stuck in incidents, etc, to just mention a few such out-points.A radio receiver that has been many times broken and is a heap of twisted parts, isnot going to get repaired, much less improved by a radio repairman finding one hugeerror in it and correcting that. He’ll have to correct a lot of minor errors in it before anymajor error even shows up.The “One-shot clear” idea of the uninformed of 1950 is impossible. When aperson goes onto the Clearing Course after missing the lower grades he just doesn’tmake it at all. He often can’t even get reads.It takes many miles of road, past many “case changes” to get up the gradient scaleto top ability.A Repair Program takes the case from where it has falsely gotten to on the ClassChart and gets off the overwhelm with light processes.The Return Program begins when the case is no longer so overwhelmed and isgetting wins from the Repair Program.21"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"THE RETURN PROGRAM CONSISTS SIMPLY OF WRITING DOWN INSEQUENCE EVERY NEEDFUL STEP AND PROCESS MISSED ON THE CLASSCHART BY THE CASE WHICH ARE NOW TO BE DONE.Example:A case has falsely gotten to R6EW Solo and isn’t making it well.The C/S writes up a light process but extensive Repair Program (first on auditing,then on life).The case achieves the EP of repair in case changes and less overwhelm.The C/S now examines the 2-way comm sessions and Examiner’s reports toestablish what levels are out. No change = Level 1. Lots of ARC Brks = Level 2.The C/S lists all the Level 1 and Level 2 processes the pc did not get done and thisis the Return Program.When these are done and the pc has made it, the C/S has the pc honestly back atR6EW on the Class Chart and continues to follow the Class Chart.Needful repairs also sometimes have to be done in getting the Return Pgm done.In each case a new Repair Program is done. The old Return Program looked over butprobably just continued.Example of a case at OT 1 now completely repaired:Case has somatics = Dn Level UnflatMakes others guilty = Level IV UnflatDramatizes = R6EW Unflat.The Return Program consists of completing Dn, rehabbing comm, all Level IVprocesses, Redo R6EW, rehab Clear, return to OT I.That completes the Return Program.In other words, when the case, found in trouble at a level, is fully repaired andwinning, the C/S studies the current data on the case to establish the major levels thatare out (each Level has an error and an ability) and then gets these into a Programwhich then session by session is followed.The program which can be completed in one session will never be written as thereis no such program.A program is the consecutive layout of what has to be done in the next manysessions.The basic program is the Class and Grade Chart.The Return Program is the return to the false point reached by getting honestlydone all the points missed on the road.The pc who can’t attest a grade ability at any point has to have:1. A Repair Pgm.2. A Return Pgm.22"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"It is a truism that the grade he can’t seem to make is not the grade. An earliergrade is out if the processes of any one grade, properly run, do not achieve that grade.The earliest error is of course a failure to achieve the lowest grade there is. Whatis out here is that the case needed to be started on a Repair Pgm for life. Now, thatskipped, one has to do a Repair on both auditing and life.The Return Pgm is easy in this instance as it just puts the pc back on what he wason, the first level. But this is the only instance where a pc is restored by the C/S to thelevel he was on without an extensive Return Program.So a Return Pgm always follows the Repair Pgm.And a Return Program consists of putting the pc over road sections he missed onthe road up.A Return Pgm is concluded and retired when the pc is back on the grade hefalsely had reached before the Repair and Return were done, and is now making thatgrade.L.

He will then be back on ClassChart properly. )-------------This is not a Repair Pgm to be copied particularly. It is given as an extent ofRepair which would then be done session by session and ticked off by the C/S as heordered each new step.The No. IV L4A prepared list would be wholly assessed for each specific list.The V and VI are a whole list of things not given here, common to such a step,but containing no dynamite-type things like “SPs” or “Overwhelm” or other things likethe names of major processes.Note that everything from I to VIII are strictly auditing repairs.IX to XVII handle life areas.This case should have been started in auditing with a Life Repair Pgm such asgiven from IX to XVII. Had he been on drugs as a habit (or just shaky about life) TRsO to 9 could have begun his auditing followed by Life Repair IX to XVII.NEW DEVELOPMENTThese actions of Repair before level auditing are a new development as such but 2way comm and these actions are all from the early ‘60s SHSBC.POSSIBLE FAULTSEvaluation, Q and A and an inability to listen resulting in the auditor choppingcomm would be the chief reasons any errors would creep into the sessions given in theRepair Program. As these might not show up in the auditing reports, if the Repair Pgmsessions did not result in gain the C/S would have the auditor’s auditing checked forthese points of Evaluation, Q and A and comm chop. The sessions are actually veryeasy to run and could be done by an Academy Class III or better by a Class VI.NOTE ON VIIIAUDITINGVIII Auditing presumed, when developed, that lower grades were still beingdelivered.VIII Auditing and Training are fully valid. They are, as the Class infers, a highlevel of auditing and remain so.The sequence of recent development has been:VIII Auditing to StandardDianetic HDC-HDG auditing to Standard DianeticsC/Sing for all levelsC/Sing below levels25"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"C/Sing to handle the neglect of lower grades and SHSBC data which are beinggotten back in rapidly.The C/S is therefore confronted with cases without lower grades and the earliestand reissued Class Chart neglected.The mania for Quickie Lower Grades and the acts by a few who fed upper“cognitions” and other evaluation to pcs wrecked for a while a part of the bridge andmade it impassable.Much of the current C/S work should take this into consideration. The RepairPgm given above is not as long as it could be and certainly would be no shorter.The IX to XVII are a brief layout of how new cases could be handled BEFOREany actual level auditing as a guarantee of real gains. This is a whole zone of action(pre-Level, pre-Dianetics) becoming increasingly necessary by the decline of the cultureas visible in pcs now beginning processing as different from those even up to 1962.These IX to XVII steps would also work on institutional cases but one shouldtake it even easier.I repeat, this Repair Pgm I to XVII is an EXAMPLE and its numbers are notuseful as different Repair Pgms would be designed by the C/S for the pc. Many otherthings could be done, none of them heavy or desperate.The C/S should caution any Registrar NOT to sell with the name “Repair Pgm”.This is entirely technical and not PR or Sales. It is just Auditing as far as the Registraris concerned.Had Pc X been processed on all earlier grades in a scramble before 1962, onewould list and then rehab every process run as part of the Return Pgm. Such a stepwould be done as the last step however of the Return Program as a prelude tostraightening out the highest grade falsely attained before Repair. The rehab would notbe a substitute for running all the processes of the levels not previously run. Rehab isno part of Repair.TECH ACTIONWe have fallen into a belief that any repair is done in Review. Review is now theplace the pc goes when the C/S gives up.Repair is a Tech Div Action and counts as hours of auditing delivered. Auditing isauditing. Obviously 2 25 hour intensives could be consumed in a Life Repair before anew pc ever came near even an assessment of the minus scale of the first Class Chartmuch less a level!In Academies, students may get anxious to “get their grades practiced” and somay skip repair actions needful. Thus upper level students should audit lower levelstudents.DIANETICSPcs audited only on Dianetics in franchises and centers will make someastonishing physical and even mental improvements. The larger percentage will do so.However, a C/S will find some have had physical gains “without finding outabout it”. The reality factor has not increased to any degree.Such pcs of course get a long Repair Program and are then given a ReturnProgram to Dianetics, their highest level.26"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The sample Repair Pgm above fits such pcs as well as one that attained higherlevels before it was found that lower grades were out.There are no variables in what the pgms are:1. Pc bogs or not gaining.2. Repair Pgm outlined and concluded.3. Return Pgm outlined and concluded.What the C/S puts in the Repair Pgm and what he puts in the Return Pgm can bevery variable indeed.C/S Q AND AThe only fault I’ve seen in a C/S trying to outline 2 way comm could be called a“C/S Q and A”.The pc has a big win about “Frogs”. A huge cog F/N VGIs changes his life.The Q and A C/S is to order “Frogs two way commed”.The system one uses is not to use pc wins as items to further handle. That stifles(overruns) the win. It’s an ability gained.One should be able to write off win items as gains and let the pc have them. Anduse items pc mentions that read (shows he has Reality on them) to push up to newwins.The C/S in looking into 2 way comm for things to handle finds his prizes insubjects that read but haven’t F/Ned.The cycle is find an item that reads, push it to F/N cog GIs. Leave that. Findanother that reads. Push it to F/N cog VGIs. Leave that. Find another. . . ..etc.2 way comm with the auditor marking F, LF, LLF, BDs, etc gives the C/Sworksheets to pick new items out of. The C/S looks to see if any of these were thesubject of any F/N. If so he crosses them off. He orders prepchecks or two way common the items that read and haven’t F/Ned.That’s the way the C/S gets his Instructions to Auditor for the exact actions of theRepair Pgm steps he has already outlined.

Only change—[page 79] word “arrived” corrected to “aimed”.Correction in this type style.)C/S Series 6WHAT THE C/S IS DOINGIn Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health considerable stress is placedon the words and phrases in engrams. This is still functional. However as I did furtherresearch I found that (a) many pcs were unable to get the words in the engram and (b)the apparent force of the words was derived wholly from the pain, emotion, effortcontained in the engram. In Standard Dianetics the words in an engram play no majorrole in the auditing.The use of the words to de-aberrate and concentration on phrases in engrams isvalid but junior in force to the pain, misemotion, etc in the engram. Thus if you run outthe force the words drop into insignificance. This is often how the pc gets cognitions:the words and meaning concealed in the engram are changing value and devaluating.The pc can then think clearly again on a subject previously pinned down by the force.Get the force out and the words take care of themselves and need no special handling.The meaning of things plays a secondary role in processing to forces.Thetans find counter-forces objectionable. Almost all chronic (continual) somaticshave their root in force of one kind or another.In that the handling of things with bodies involves force to greater or lesserdegree, incapability and derangement of mental values is proportional to the thetan’sobjection to force.This objection descends down to a wish to stop things. It goes below that intooverwhelmedness in which propitiation and obsessive agreement manifest themselves.LOW TAsThe low TA is a symptom of an overwhelmed being.When a pc’s TA goes low he is being overwhelmed by too heavy a process, toosteep a gradient in applying processes or by rough TRs or invalidative auditing orauditing errors.A low TA means that the thetan has gone past a desire to stop things and is likelyto behave in life as though unable to resist real or imaginary forces.HIGH TAChronically high TAs mean the person can still stop things and is trying to do so.However, all one has to do is restimulate and leave unflat an engram chain to havea high TA. High TA is reflecting the force contained in the chain.An “over-run” means doing something too long that has engrams connected withit which means an engram chain with too many engrams on it being restimulated by lifeor auditing. Hence Over-run.28"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"If this overrun persisted unhandled eventually the pc would be overwhelmed andone, in theory, would have a low TA.MENTAL MASSESMental masses, forces, energy are the items being handled by the C/S on any pc.If the C/S loses sight of this he can wander off the road and go into the thickets ofsignificance.Engrams, secondaries, locks all add up to mental masses, forces, energies, time,which express themselves in countless different ways such as pain, misemotion,feelings, old perceptions and a billion billion thought combinations buried in the massesas significances.A thetan can postulate or say or reason anything. Thus there is an infinity ofsignificances.A thetan is natively capable of logical thought. This becomes muddied by out-points held in by mental forces such as pictures of heavy experiences.As the masses and forces accumulated and copied from living build up, the logicpotential becomes reduced and illogical results occur.PC SEARCHThe pc is continually searching for the significance of a mass or force—what is it,why is it.The C/S is easily led astray by this.All forces in the bank contain significances.All forces can be unburdened and lightened up by the various procedures ofauditing.The search of the pc is for significance.The action of the C/S is reduction of forces.THE E-METERThe E-Meter records what force is being discharged in every slash, fall andblowdown. The amount of TA per session is the C/S’s index of gain.Note that a discharged process no longer gives TA and gives case gain.The amount of significance recovered or realized by the pc only shows up ascognitions.As the TA works off the case, then one has two indicators:1. There is needle and TA action.2. The pc cognites.One shows that force is coming off. Two shows that thought is releasing fromforce.BACKWARDS C/SingIf a C/S processes toward significance only he will get cases that do not progress.29"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The needle action detects not so much significance as where the force is.Diving toward significance the C/S winds up shortening grades, looking for“magic one-shot buttons” and overwhelming cases by shooting them on up the gradeswhile levels remain loaded with force.RELIABLE INDICATORSWhen a pc gets no more TA action on Level I he will have made Level I and willknow it. He will therefore attest to “No problems”.The reliable indicators are TA action and cognitions while a level is still charged.Diminished TA action and cognitions mean the purpose of the level has beenreached.A feeling of freedom and expansion on a subject is expressed in a normal TA anda loose needle.The pc will now attest to an ability regained.F/N ABUSETo process only to F/N and even chop off the cognitions on a process abuses theindicator of the F/N.You can find many pcs who bitterly resent F/N indications. They have been:A. Not run on all the processes of a level;B. Still have force on the subject;C. Were chopped off before they could cognite.The ARC Break in this is UNFINISHED CYCLE OF ACTION.The proper End Phenomena for a process is F/N Cognition VGIs. Now look atthat carefully. That is the proper end phenomena of a PROCESS. It is not the endphenomena of a LEVEL or even of a TYPE of process.Let us say there are 15 possible Scientology processes for orienting a pc in hispresent location.To run one of these 15 and say, “F/N that’s it. You’re complete,” is a Quickieimpatient action that rebounds on the pc eventually. If there are 15, run 15 !Possibly the pc on no. 12 will cognite he’s really right where he is. Only thencould you cease to work at it.An F/N Cog VGIs tells you a process is finished, not a whole class of actions!Thus 2l/2 minutes from 0 to IV is not only impossible, it is murderous. It willresult in an overwhelm, a low TA or a high TA eventually.Level I says, amongst other things, “Problems Processes”. There are certainlyhalf a dozen. Each would be run to F/N Cog VGIs. When these and the other processesof the Level are run, the pc will come to have no further reaction to problems and willbe able to handle them.A cognition in lower levels is not necessarily an ability regained. Thirty or fortycognitions on one lower level might add up to (and probably would) the realization thatone is free of the whole subject of the level.30"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"It is safe to run more processes. It is unsafe to run too few.PC ABILITIESIt is not enough for the pc to have only negative gains of deleting force. Sooner orlater he will have to begin to confront force.This comes along naturally and is sometimes aided by processes directly aimed atfurther confront. “What problem could you have?” sooner or later is needed in oneform or another.What force can the pc now handle?All auditing in a body—and any living in a body—makes a being vulnerable.Bodies break, suffer, intensify pain.Sooner or later a pc will go Exterior. The Interiorization Rundown must beordered as the next action or you will have a pc with a high TA. 2-way comm Ext-Intmust be given in a following session (not the same one) so the full cognitions willoccur.After this the pc is less subject to the body and his ability to confront force willimprove.Do not be too worried or surprised if after this the pc has some minor accidentwith the body. Exterior he forgets its frailty. However, such things are minor. He is“learning how to walk” a new way and will run into chairs! He gets this figured outafter a while.Pcs sometimes improve their ability to handle force while interior so as to havemysterious headaches or new body pressures. Inevitably they have been exterior andneed Interiorization run. They were just using too much force while still inside !Thus force is the thing, significance very secondary.Force of course is made up of time, matter, energy, flows, particles, masses,solids, liquids, gasses, space and locations. All this gets inherently handled inprocesses published long since.The pc tends to dive for the thought imbedded in the force. He will tell you he’sbeing processed to find out who his parents were or why he is sterile or who did himin, etc, etc. The C/S who chases after this is a deerhound illegally chasing mice!C/S PURPOSEThe C/S is there to make certain that the pc makes gains and attains the actualabilities of the level.The C/S is for the pc.C/S auditor control exists only to keep the auditing standard, the TRs good, theprocesses ordered done and to End Phenomena each one.No other reasons for C/Sing exist.

Many various outlines of what Q and A is already exist andthis is just to refresh the subject. Example: Student Auditor is ordered “2-way comm oncities,” by the C/S which is okay. But it can be Q and Aed like this: Student: “Tell mewhat you think about cities.” Pc: “They’re cold.” Student: “What about cold?” Pc: “Idon’t like it.” Student: “What else don’t you like?” Pc: “Well ...... old men.” Student:“What about old men?” Pc: “They’re obnoxious.” Student: “What else is obnoxious?”Pc: “.....” Well you remember all about that. It’s maddening and shows no auditorcontrol and certainly doesn’t handle the original C/S subject of “cities”.There are three main ways in which a C/S can Q and A in C/Sing.PC C/SPc goes to Examiner on own volition and says, “I am ill. I need my ruds flown.”A C/S Q and A would be “Fly ruds.”Pc on his own goes to Examiner and says, “I am upset about my job.”C/S writes “L1B on job.”You get the idea. The first one is therefore Q and Aing with Exam statement ofpc.This is varied by taking a pc’s note or letter or report and accepting what the pcsays is wrong. Like “I’m PTS to my husband.” And then C/Sing “2-way comm onhusband.”Naturally the ancient law applies here. If the pc knew what it was it would not bewrong and would as-is. Pc coming up to Exam saying, “It’s my husband!” with F/NCog VGIs would be what would happen if it was the husband. And that would be greatbut of no real value to C/S except pc has had a win and not to now use “husband”.Give you an actual example: Pc in Solo ruds found she hated George. It F/Ned.Next audited session pc was saying she hated George. Wrote a note about George. C/Sdid not notice the outness. Ordered LIB on George and in a 2-way comm got little or noTA, continued to be ill. The fact is it wasn’t George at all and not even a terminal. Pchad gone up one grade too many, hit an overwhelm, the earlier 6 grades were out!Correct action was to have done a general repair the moment a pc suddenly andmysteriously caved in and got ill on a new level! The pc never should have been goingon up grades for the last 6 grades!The tendency to toss it all off with a Q and A not only didn’t handle but obscuredthe real situation.32"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"C/Sing A WINThe second Q and A is to C/S a pc win.Pc in 2-way comm mentions cats and more cats and cats and finally at the end ofsession has a big F/N Cog VGIs on cats.The C/S sees all this “cat” mention and orders “Prepcheck cats.”That is a very cruel sort of Q and A.Another version of it of course is to see a pc reach a full End Phenomena on aseries of processes like an unmistakable pc-volunteered valence shift and keep on goinginto an inval. Correction is to rehab of course.Yet another version is to pull a w/h and then keep pulling it so the pc doesn’tthink it’s gone. Correction is to rehab of course.The TA often goes high or low on these Q and A actions and Inval-Eval actionsare ordered and the release point rehabbed.NEXT GRADE PLEASE!The third Q and A a C/S can pull is to agree to the pc’s demands for the nextgrade despite all contrary indicators.“I’m ready for Clear now!” says the pc full of somatics whose R6EW wasn’treally done and who can’t talk.The Registrar, execs and others push on this also.The D of P and C/S have total authority on this. They should be diplomatic. “Hecan have the grade of course but I will have to prepare him for it,” is the best answer.“Please make arrangements for Clear preparation—25 hours.”If the C/S doesn’t hold the fort on this the pc put into the next grade who isn’tready will fall on his head.If this pressure from the pc (in any version) continues, have him sign a waiver “Iwill not hold the org or any principals responsible and waive any refund if I am put onnext grade.” That either gets home or he says okay and signs. So put him on the gradeand hope he doesn’t fall on his head—and if he does, now demand he get the hoursneeded to get fixed up so he can really make it.A D of P or C/S often have other pressures exerted on them that are not technicalin nature such as economics, ambition, status symbols (of having a high graderegardless of a headache) and have to cope with these diplomatically. But any but techconsiderations are dangerous to entertain.SUMMATIONOf these 3, 2 are concerned with letting someone else C/S. Like an engineerletting someone else plan the railroad.And the third is also slightly in that nature, consisting of not noticing the pc’swins and using them with which to C/S.CAUTIONThis doesn’t mean the pc is always wrong. He is generally right when he sayshe’s overwhelmed or upset. He’s almost always wrong when he says what33"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"overwhelmed him or what BPC was out WHEN SIMPLY SAYING IT DOES NOTCORRECT THE CASE OR PRODUCE F/N VGIs.You always use the pc’s data one way or another in that you are paralleling whatthe MIND does.

It can be plus or minus, above or below. It is seldom that the pc’s reality ishigher than the processes used and really only occurs when a grade honestly run isrerun. Then you get pc protest as he’s made that.Pcs who get sick suddenly are being run far too high on the Class Chart. Pcs whodon’t change are also being run too high.Behavior, mannerisms are the index.

The no-somatic pc is either high as an angel or being run too high.You don’t have to run directly at force for forces to change in the pc.One 2 way comm I did with a pc released his hold on a huge bundle of forces!The body responds badly to forces.The conflict between protecting or using a body and being as a thetan able towithstand large forces gets so mixed up in a pc he can wind up as a force-shy thetan !STANDARD PROCESSESStandard processes such as those in use for 18 years handle this when fitted intotheir levels.What the C/S has to realize is that he is (a) producing an optimum rate of changein the pc if he is C/Sing well and (b) changing the pc’s position upward on the Chart ofHuman Evaluation.

It was a growing cultural disinclination to do things thoroughly.“Fast, quick results” was interpreted as seconds or minutes. In old psychotherapyas practiced in the 19th Century it required ONE YEAR of weekly consultation to see ifanything could be done about a case and FOUR MORE YEARS to produce a meagersuperficial result. Compared to that two or three hundred hours of processing wasnothing.As we began to dominate this field in terms of persons handled and resultsobtained, psychiatry invented “instant psychiatry” by which no result was gotten in notime.SPEED became the primary consideration of the culture. Jet planes, fast cars“saved time”. But an old Chinese, when told by a driver that he had saved 4 minutes inspeeding back from town asked, “What are you going to do with the 4 minutes?”Time itself is a basis of aberration. Dropping time out is the consideration offactory managers of production lines as “the faster something can be made the moreyou have of it”. But look at this again. Something can be done so fast it isn’t done atall! The difference between a very fine camera and a cheap one is speed of manufacture.Cheap cameras don’t get their parts carefully machined or matched—they don’t fittogether—they break, cease to work. A fine gun can be told by the lack of tool markson the hidden places. A cheap gun’s inner bolt is a mess of scars. It isn’t smooth inoperation. It didn’t take much time to make but it also jams and freezes up when you tryto use it. Maybe you’ve heard of “hotter than a 2 dollar pistol”. A 2 dollar pistol is“hot” because it’s so quickie made it usually blows up and blows off a hand.There is a point where SPEED is simply a cover for a cheap worthless product.Let us take a filthy room. A lazy housekeeper comes in and sweeps a few bits ofdust under the carpet, leaves soot all over the windows and garbage on the mantle andsays it’s clean. Somebody else not afraid of work spends an hour at it and leaves areally clean room.SHORT PGMSA short pc program is economically and efficiently for the birds.In the first place a C/S has to know the extent of his tech well to be able to thinkup light processes in quantity.If one heard a C/S say, “But I don’t have time to spend an hour doing a longprogram for the pc,” one is listening to something peculiar. If one spent an hour or twodoing up a real long 20 action program to repair the pc, then for the next 20 C/Ses ittakes only a few minutes to look over the session and order the next action on the list.If one had no program one would have to study the folder each time. One actually savesC/S time by doing long programs both to repair and to get the pc back on the ClassChart where he’d gotten to.37"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Further, auditing is sold by the hour and it WASTES money and income and pcsto short program them.“Yes but we sell result! If we can get 200 pcs done in 100 auditing minutes wewould make £18,233 clear profit ..“Well the cruel answer to that was when orgs began to do that on lower gradesthey didn’t attain the result on the pc and stats went DOWN!Power was once priced against the fact of 50 to 100 hours of auditing. It retainedthe price and by cutting out all End Phenomena or real gain it was at last being given in20 minutes. And after just so many years of this economic dishonesty, SHs crashed!They had sold out the real value of the product for a quick buck. The “field” became“ARC Broken” and few takers came to an SH. It is a very long hard road back. And itis a very costly one.“Quickie Grades”, instead of making fortunes for one and all, crashed the wholeScientology network.BECAUSE QUICKIE RESULTS ARE LAZY AND DISHONEST.Let’s just face up to the facts of life!Selling out the integrity of the subject for a buck wrecks the subject.SUCCESSThe real stat of an org is Success Stories.Honest grades and time spent in C/Sing and in auditing to obtain them add up tosuccess for the individual, the org, its field, the country and the planet.The time it takes to process somebody is how long it takes to get each singleresult available. It is not how slowly or quickly it is done. A book is not a good book ifit takes 7 years to write. And a bad book isn’t always written in 2 weeks. It takes aslong to write a good book as you get a good book. The result is the result and TIME ISJUST AN ENTERED ARBITRARY.A person who overwhelms at Grade IV is an easily overwhelmed person. It mighttake 50 hours just to repair the case and the person’s life. That might be 20 or 30 stepson the program.If the C/S can’t dream up 8 or 9 ways to repair past auditing and 15 or 20 ways torepair a life, then it’s time to go back and read The Original Thesis, Evolution of aScience, DMSMH, 8-80, 8-8008 and listen to a hundred or so SHSBC tapes.“Yes, but I have no time to .” Well, that’s also saying “It can’t be donewell.”But there is time. If anyone looked over his area he would be able to throw outthe time-wasting actions if it comes to that.“Look. I’m the C/S, the D of P and have to audit 3.......”That’s a statement that the job has already been done so badly that no personsshow up to take over the extra hats! And the no-result programs cripple the economicsand that becomes no help.I have seen Mary Sue take over an HGC that had tons of unsolved cases and toofew auditors and have watched her solve one case at a time and within 2 weeks have 35auditors and no backlogs and in six weeks no unsolved cases! She was using the “old”,“historical”, “background”, “we don’t use them anymore” processes!38"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"So it not only can be done, it is the thing to do.That org’s stats soared. It became solvent. It ran at a high run and was a happyorg.SICK PCsWhen there are sick people on a list one doesn’t just “give a Dianetic Assist” andsend to a doctor and write them off.If one knows his tech, there was a reason the person got sick. One also knows asick person goes into overwhelm easily.One can do a touch assist, a contact assist, two-way comm, ruds on the accident,ruds before the accident, Dianetic Assist, medical treatment, life ruds, HCO B 24 July‘69, two-way comm on suppression, 3 S & Ds, assessment for area of illness,prepcheck on area, ruds on area, hello and okay with the affected area, reach andwithdraw from area, two-way comm, recall on persons similarly ill, location of thepostulate that caused it with itsa earlier itsa, prepcheck on the body or its part, moreHCO B 24 July ‘69, more ruds, assessment of failed purposes, two-way comm on thesickness.That’s not a program. It’s just a helter-skelter list of a lot of things to do. It wouldnot greatly matter what order they were done in but lighter actions should be the earlier.And in a program auditing repair comes before life repair.EXPECTANCYNow if a C/S or an auditor has a magical complex, he expects ONE process torun a person from wog to OT VI and in ONE minute.The missing knowledge is “gradient scales”. Stairs and ladders have steps andrungs. It takes TIME to climb a tower.The magical complex thinks of processes as incantations or charms. A personC/Sing would always be trying to find THE process the pc should be run on. The thinkis that THE process, once discovered, would take no time at all and the pc wouldmagically become well!Pardon me, but that’s pure goofiness.And it would set the C/S up for constant FAILURE.One sees such a person scrambling through processes, trying to guess “whichone which one which one. Oh there’s one! Now we run it for 3 minutes on the pc. Ohdear. It didn’t work. He isn’t well. Let’s see what’s here still. Scramble scramble. Oh,here’s one. This green paper is probably the right color. Auditor! Run this on the pc.Oh dear, it didn’t work. He isn’t well yet. So! We will take these 5 major processesand run them all in one session and add six grades. Do that! Do it! It’s a desperatesituation. Oh dear, the pc blew. Well I guess the subject doesn’t work or I’m a failure...”That is NOT how one should C/S.If a workman was supposed to cure an ox hide and was told salt would do it andhe had a magical complex, what would he do. Well, he might take a small salt shakerand sprinkle the corner of the hide (thinking the right thought) and find that the hiderotted in a few days. He could then conclude salt didn’t cure ox hides. If someone kepthammering at him to cure ox hides with salt and he kept sprinkling the corner (knowingit wouldn’t work) he’d get a very odd idea about his orders! But who would suspectthat this workman thought it was magic! An honest rubbing of salt all over and into theox hide is the meaning of “salt will cure ox hides”!39"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"But that would take work. It would take TIME! It would have to be honestly andthoroughly done. But one would have cured ox hides and gotten shoes and a profit andpay and everything for one had a product.Magical thought in auditing isn’t likely to give anyone a product of really ablepeople!SHORT-CUTTING PROCESSESProcesses can be short-cut as well as programs.Take an early (means basic, useful, usable) version of Rising Scale. There are 18pairs. Each pair should be run to F/N, Cog, VGIs.An auditor told to run Rising Scale can run along the 18 pairs until one F/Ns. Andleave it.The process has been short-cut. And with that shortcut went its ability to restorefertility!So one hears Rising Scale will sometimes restore fertility or change eyesight.Orders it done. It is done to 1 F/N. No real result occurs.Or take Dianetics. Dianetics can be chopped “to save TIME”. First feeble flutter ofan F/N, no Cog, no VGIs, auditor barking “Did it erase? Did it erase?” Final result, noreal gain. There goes the subject. Half an hour to run the chain, no extra 30 seconds forthe real F/N, the Cog, the VGIs.SO ONE WASTES A RESULT FOR THE SAKE OF SAVED TIME.THE AGEIt is a symptom of the age that there is no time. But in the Data Series PLs onefinds that “omitted time” is a basic insanity.That a body lives only about 70 years puts an awful limit on Man.Man’s Empires endure at most only about 300 years if that.70 years is not enough time to make a real career and 300 years is not enoughtime to even groove in a civil service.Man pays for it with poor lives and rotten governments.But it doesn’t take 70 years or 300 years to process a pc. A year maybe up tohomo novis. A few years to OT. Even traveling it casually slow.25 hours to repair someone’s life and 50 to 100 hours to get him up to nosomatics with Dianetics is pretty satisfactorily fast.What’s this take? A week to repair. 2 to 4 weeks for full Dianetics. At 25 hours aweek. That’s very little.And it’s enough to tell him to get trained so he can have all he wants.SPEED LIABILITYWhen speed is the consideration, not results, you get a very cheap camera or car.And you can expect it to fall apart very soon. You also get a cheap reputation.We are in the Leica and Cadillac and Rolls Royce product class without trying.40"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Why settle for “Quickie Grades”?You get no students that way and that’s the heavy org income. You get noexpanding field. And you won’t ever get a cleared planet.We’ve learned all this the hard way. So let’s not let it go unheeded.The place to handle the situation is with C/Sing.And to gain the co-operation of C/Ses to make results real results by insisting thatspeed is the fast road to poverty in the long run.If the C/S burden is too heavy, start pushing training. Then you’ll get help.Honest C/Sing gives an honest result.It takes as long to correct a case as it takes. It takes as long to make a person wellas it takes. It takes as long to get a real lasting grade result as it takes.And that’s a lot longer than the time spent on it in the late 60’s.ALL pcs “have to be OT tomorrow”. Why let them C/S their case by demanding itonly take 2 minutes?Self C/Sing is no more effective than self auditing.Registrars as well as pcs try to grab the C/S hat. “I will sell you a marital intensivebecause you have such a bad cold.” And Execs, “Run this staff member onmoney.......”Well, a C/S’s hat is the C/S’s. And he should wear it for honest results. Anddamn others trying to C/S and wreck his job.THERE ARE NO CONSIDERATIONS WHICH FORGIVE ANY RESULTTHAT IS NOT THOROUGH AND HONEST FOR EVERY PROGRAM OR GRADE.L.

A goofed session ismore overwhelm. AND it was goofed on a process type which was already what youwould use for Repair. So NOW what do you do?The answer of course is to sort out the real error. If you can’t find it readily in theworksheet have the Examiner ask the pc what the auditor did.Then having found the actual goof, you have it repaired by rehab of the BP F/N oran L1B using “Method 3” in assessing the prepared list.The goofs are fortunately few in type.There HAS to have been a basic goof for a Repair session to have gone wrong.So when one goes wrong, you really search the worksheet until you find it and if itisn’t visible get the pc asked.These goofs are pretty elementary. The auditor possibly doesn’t know that a TAcan go DOWN by overwhelming by overrun or way up by overrun. So a usual goof inRepair is overrun of an F/N or an item that F/Ned or a list that F/Ned.Example: In a Repair Pgm a GF is called for. Auditor clears a couple items,suddenly hits a hot one, pc gets F/N, Cog, VGIs. Auditor (told to get all the charge off theGF overlooks senior data—let pc have a win, GFs often raise hob with the TA if runfurther than THE item) goes on down the GF list past the F/N VGIs hunting for newcharge. Pc’s TA goes to 1.6 ! Pc cogs he has a stuck picture. TA 1.6. “End of sess.”Now what do we do. Well, a new factor now enters in.C/S WANDERThe pc was on a precise Repair Pgm, is only at VI out of XVIII steps.But the pc is rough. Rough running. Diverges, critical, boggy.And now he is stuck into a goofed session and we have to repair a repair!A C/S at this point can wander. He can Q and A. The WHOLE REPAIR PGM CANGET DEPARTED FROM AND THE PC REALLY BOGGED.When faced with Repairing a Repair Pgm session watch it! Don’t wander!The C/S procedure is this:1. Find in the W/S or from the pc the exact goof.2. Repair that goof by rehab, indicating BPC or two way comm, depending onthe error.3. DO NOT ORDER A NEW DIFFERENT NON-PGM ACTION.4. Continue the PGM.42"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"It is here a C/S can go adrift. New actions crossing the original program can soonhave C/S, pc and Auditor chasing over hill and dale. It is a fatal pursuit.About the only time you change a Repair Pgm once outlined is to extend it orlighten it. But in that case do a whole new Pgm.You will find 2 way comm is lighter than a Prepcheck.Let us say pc was doing great on 2 way comm. Gets into a Prepcheck session andgoes out the bottom.In such a case the Prepcheck is repaired of any goof noted in it and 2 way commthat session—and it comes out all right. If no goof can be located, 2 way comm it and itwill be okay.An Auditor can throw a list not ordered into a Repair Pgm by finding the TA highat session start and doing an O/R list and goofing the list. It would already be dicey to lista pc who is on a Repair Pgm. To then goof ordinary laws of listing and nulling can getgrim.The first C/S action to repair the repair is of course to get the list corrected with anL4A. You can often spot the listing goof as a C/S. It’s usually an O/R of an O/R list or anincomplete list or an “unnecessary list”. It’s poison to list a pc on a Repair Pgm,however. 2 way comm it.If a check for Exteriorization reveals it, you have no choice but to do anInteriorization Rundown. That’s a common reason. But if the pc is already flinching atengrams, limit the Interiorization to 3 way Recall and note it clearly that he’s only 3 wayRecall of Int.AUDITOR FLUBSStudent or new Auditors produce the most flubs. It is therefore good to keep themoff repair actions or Repair Pgms.The commonest flubs are failing to trim the meter and ignoring the F/N at “3.1”,yet sitting right there running the pc up to 4.0 without ever asking, “Have we by-passed arelease point?”Poor TRs, not having 2 way comm down, neglecting pc origin or chopping commare probably next in order of frequency.REPAIR PCsRemember that pcs who need lots of repair are DELICATE cases. Feather touch isthe watchword.They are not all that easy to audit. They can cause Auditors and C/Ses to disperse.Such pcs are afraid of force and easily get engulfed if pushed hard into the bank.So lightly, lightly.And exact repair of any flub.And get back to the program!

Is open to misduplication and can cause squirrel processes to be run and somess up a preclear with Non-standard Tech.Any C/Supervisor found guilty of this from this date is to be removed as thiscould only be considered a deliberate attempt to mess up preclears.POINTS ON CASE SUPERVISION1. Check your orders to find out if auditor did them.44"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"2. Check to see if commands correct and if pc’s reaction was expected reaction forthose commands.3.

Above all else hold a standard and NEVER listen to or use unusual solutions.DOUBLE FOLDER DANGERWhen a preOT has a Solo and an Auditing folder, both, there is a great danger ifthe Case Supervisor does not look at BOTH before C/Sing.There has been an instance of a preOT running strange C/Ses on himself. Anotherran C/Ses out of other folders on himself. In both cases the consequences were hard torepair when finally found.In another case in the Solo folder the preOT had gone exterior with fullperception. But the Non-Solo Auditing folder was being C/Sed. The TA shot up for 2months without any C/S except myself calling for all folders.PreOTs unfortunately run on a Solo folder and an audited folder. Unless both areto hand when C/Sing wild errors can be made by the C/S.There is also the case of a person having two audited folders, being C/Sed at thesame time. This is an Admin error.The firm rule is C/S ONLY WITH ALL FOLDERS TO HAND.The embarrassing situation where one can’t get a folder from another org or fieldauditor or where the old folder is lost has to be made up for somehow. It mustn’t haltauditing totally.CASE SUPERVISOR—FOLDER HANDLINGAnalyzing FoldersGo back in the folder to the session where the preclear was running well andcome forward from it doing a folder error summary.Reviewing FoldersIn reviewing a folder, the first thing to do is to look at the C/S to see if it wasdone.Use the Summary Sheet to get the Auditor’s attitude and pc mannerism changes.Use the Auditor’s Report Form to get the time of processes.45"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Read and take all your data from Worksheets and compare it to and see that C/Swas complied with and ensure Standard Tech was applied.If you can’t read the reports, send it back to have the Auditor over-print illegiblewords.

The only reasonit doesn’t work is that it hasn’t been applied.The main question of a Case Supervisor is:WAS IT APPLIED?If you follow this exactly, you’ll never miss.CASE SUPERVISOR DATAA Case Supervisor should watch for Ethics record of pcs who have been C/Sed.If they fall on their head, get into low conditions, the folder should be reviewed.Most probably the auditor did not do what was ordered and, if folder looks okay,chances are the auditing report is false as something is wrong or pc would not be introuble.AUDITING AND ETHICSCases undergoing Ethics actions, Comm Evs, amends projects or low conditionsshould not be audited until the Ethics matter is cleared up and complete. It only lousesup their cases to audit them when under such stress.ADMINAuditors must always put the pc’s grade or OT level very prominently on theAuditing Report.A Case Supervisor cannot properly C/S a case without having this data.To not do this is out admin.OUT ADMIN—LIABILITYMuch has been said about the importance of admin in auditing but auditors justaren’t getting it—so ........ it now becomes a LIABILITY to have out admin in pcs’folders.Folders are to be submitted with the latest session on top. Auditor’s report form isstapled to Worksheets which are dated, numbered and in order, latest on top. SummaryReport is then attached to the auditing report and W/Ss with a paper clip. This of courseis as well as the usual admin such as legible writing, re-writing illegible words,marking reads and F/Ns, and all End Phenomena, etc.46"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The C/S instructions for that session go under that session, so you get C/S4/6/68, Auditing Session 4/6/68, C/S 5/6/68, Auditing Session 5/6/68, C/S 7/6/68,etc, etc.As the whole purpose of Class VIII is to minimize the time in auditing, by doingperfect Standard Tech, this cannot be done if it takes 15 minutes to put the folder inorder, so it can then be case supervised, so it can then be audited.GROSS CASE SUPERVISION ERRORS1.

It has been found that case gainwhich has not been earlier achieved can be consolidated by a PROGRESS PROGRAM.It takes 25 hours, can be done by a Class I or above as long as it is C/Sed by an VIIIwho has starrated on the new C/S Series. This is quite a technical development in itself.It is the answer to a pc who had “Quickie Grades” and didn’t actually reach full abilitiesin earlier Scientology auditing. It is followed by an Advance Program which followsbelow.ADVANCE PROGRAM:This is what was called a “Return Program” in the C/S Series. The name is beingchanged from “Return” to “Advance” as more appropriate. It gets the pc really up towhere he should be. It may take 50 hours or more.EXPANDED LOWER GRADES:Pcs won’t like being told they “have to have their lower grades rerun”. Actuallythat’s not a factual statement anyway. The lower grades harmonic into the OT Levels.They can be run again with full 1950-1960 to 1970 processes as given on the SHCourses all through the 1960s. These are now regrouped and sorted out and are calledEXPANDED LOWER GRADES. Only this route will now be sold. There are noDianetic or Scientology single—triple or “Quickie Lower Grades” any more.DIANETIC CLEAR:There is such a state. It is not however attained by feeding people Scientologycognitions as was done in L.A. Only about 25% go actually Clear on Dianetics. ADianetic Clear or any other Dianetic pc now goes on up through the grades ofScientology and onto the proper Clearing Course. The Dianetic Clear of Book I wasclear of somatics.

There is nostatement to that effect. It is not guessed that this will be assumed and so we could losean entire subject.We did in fact lose Dianetics for a decade and all but lost Scientology in thefollowing ten years.A subject can be reorganized and made more workable. That was done in 1969for Dianetics. BUT IT HAD NEVER BEEN UNWORKABLE!The 1969 Dianetics Reorganization refined the 1962-63 discoveries of R-3-R. Abetter communication was made to the user and the preclear.Amazingly, the reissue of Dianetics as Standard Dianetics caused about a dozenpeople (even in high places unfortunately) to at once assume that Dianetics wiped outany need for Power, Scientology Clearing or anything else! Even an unauthorizedPolicy Letter (not signed by me) and an HCO B (also not signed by me) gave thisimpression. They were of course cancelled the instant they were discovered to havebeen sent out.This idea that the “old” is always cancelled by anything “new” has its root in theidea that a later order cancels earlier orders, which is true. But orders are one thing andTech basics another.What if, in the science of physics, a book by Professor Glumph came out,omitting the three laws of motion and gravity. It is assumed then that Newton’s lawsare no longer valid. Because they are old. (Newton lived between 1642 and 1727.) Sosome young student engineer is baffled because bridges have weight and can’t workout gravity or motion! And he and his fellows begin to build without knowing theselaws and there goes the whole of engineering and the culture itself!This is no fantasy. As a college student in upper math I was utterly baffled by“calculus”. I couldn’t find out what it was for. Then I discovered it had been developedby Sir Isaac Newton, examined the basics and got the idea. My college text omitted allthe basic explanations and even the authorship of the subject! Calculus today is reallynot enough used because it isn’t understood.Anyway, here’s the main surprise: Until 1970 the whole of Scientology wasnever in use in processing! Students had ridden along with the research line up into theOT sections, discarding the ladder behind them. For nearly 3 years an increasingproportion of preclears were not actually making it. The gradient to get them onto thebridge had been neglected as “old” when in fact they were not “old” but BASIC.The amazement of auditors (and their delight) when the HCO B on Auditor’sRights (C/S Series 1) was released indicated that they had become “process oriented”with all the WHY gone.50"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"VIII AUDITINGThe 1968 VIII Standardization aimed actually at good TRs, auditing presence,and basics in auditor performance. VIII auditing was developed to handle the OT band.It is entirely valid. Its only omission was detailed actions now developed as tohow to handle a pc or Pre OT who had been pulled up the line and had fallen on hishead.Out Grades was spotted and discussed in detail in VIII auditing.Giving lower grades fast was the only error. It was not realized in 1968 that EndPhenomena of lower grades was not being required.The re-release of the entire band of Academy and Saint Hill materials in 1970 is are-emphasis on the validity and necessity of using it ALL on pcs! And in understandingthe mind and life! And all this is quite welcome and very successful. Not noticed is thatthis whole band was never before presented for full use on all pcs. As I say, 1950-1969 auditors had been riding with the “newest and latest” because it was “popular”.Only a few wise old-timers continued to use the most basic actions.But just as VIII auditing was an unauthorized signal to suppress all that had beenknown before, so now, with the full release for use of Expanded Lower Grades, a fewbegan to say that VIII auditing was now “old”!One assumes then that some like to be able to say that something is now “old”.Has a superior sort of ring to it, I guess. Anyway we’d better disregard this tendency toretire basics. It is more amusing than otherwise. So let’s get on with the job.RESISTIVE CASESThe RESISTIVE CASE rundown is an VIII development TO HANDLE THOSEWHO CANNOT MAKE THE GRADES.It was put into the Green Form as GF 40 so as to preserve it.To it could now be added “Overwhelmed”. This would indicate need of Repair(Progress) and Return (Advance) Programs. But many other indicators exist already.So when do you use a GF 40?Let us say the pc has been run on Grade Zero. And at the Examiner cannot ordoes not attest.One would first look for simple auditing errors in recent sessions. These wouldget reviewed and corrected.One would then look for lower actions than Grade Zero that had been missed.If it still seemed hard to figure out, one would use a GF 40, Resistive Cases.In essence, if one adds “Overwhelm” to the GF 40 list you have on it all thereasons a pc won’t advance IF he has been run on all processes up to that point.Overwhelm would indicate need of a Repair and Return.Grade I, Problems, is the usual ordinary reason for no case advance.Problems shows up as an out-rud in GF 40 and is simply put in as a rud not as agrade.But if a Grade II or above has a Problem??? That means Grade I is out.51"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"GF 40 remains even more plainly as a “When all else fails”.It is used that way.When a pc doesn’t attest, and all has been done for him otherwise, you use a GF40.This was its proper use in the first place.All such materials except Rapid or Quickie Grades are valid.And (joke) these remarks on GF 40 Resistive Cases do not wipe out “Repair andReturn Programs”.IV RUNDOWNThe so-called IV Rundown as taught on the VIII Course is of course quite valid.Originally developed to catch cases that had somehow gotten up to OT III andwere falling on their heads, it is a collection of actions. It salvaged many cases.The missing datum was that in recent times these cases were falsely reported tohave had their lower grades. THEY, the cases themselves, said they had “had lowergrades”. This made a mystery. The fact is, with multiple declare (declaring 0 to IV tothe Examiner all at one time mostly without any mention of End Phenomena of thegrade) these cases were OUT GRADE in the extreme.The IV Rundown was an effort to catch it all up to make a real OT.“Out Grades” didn’t read as it didn’t mean anything to the pc and besides “they’dall been rehabbed a dozen times anyway”. But nobody mentioned never having attainedany End Phenomena and the Class Chart was never really gotten IN IN IN in the firstplace.You will find many pcs have had various parts of the “IV Rundown” run earlier.For a while it was the fashion to use the IV Rundown or a part of it on any balkycase at any level. At OT IV (which was an audited step and none of it reallyconfidential) the C/S simply ordered run whatever was left of it not already run.Somewhere on the case all of the IV Rundown still should be run. But of coursethat would now be on a Return (Advance) Program and well up the line.If Repair-Return doesn’t get a grade made this is the time to do a IV Rundown.On (3) Valence Shifter—LX1, LX2, LX3 lists can be done in triple, recall, secondary,engram. Earlier Practices, Former Therapy can also be triple, recall, secondary,engram.This is on Page 28 (not 23) of the original VIII Case Supervisor Manual and partof it is also now GF 40.If a case really needs this he won’t be making a lower grade really so the GF 40or its slightly wider OT IV Rundown can be used.To both, “Overwhelmed by auditing” should be added in any future issue toindicate a needed repair action.CASE SUPERVISOR ACTIONSHCO B 10 Dec 1968, “Case Supervisor Actions” Confidential, VIIIs only, is stillvalid. It remains Confidential as it mentions some OT phenomena that would spin a52"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Grade Va. However, some VIII C/S is going to be told that “Expanded Lower Gradeschanges all that”. It doesn’t.Listen: In the next to last paragraph of the cover page of this manual (HCO B 10Dec 68) it says:“Standard Grades are not part of this set-up AS IT IS UNDERSTOOD THATTHE AUDITOR KNOWS THESE. Directions to do Standard Grades are written on ablank sheet.” (I have added the block letters for emphasis here.)At the time this was written I had not discovered that Lower Grades were goneout of use and I let be published Triple Grades which seemed to condense all lowergrades. The Major Process or Major Grade Process is definitely not enough to make apc make a lower grade. I am sorry I gave any support at all to such an idea by notexamining the whole scene when it began to show up. / did find it and did correct ithowever when auditing statistics over the world showed the fault. (28 hours was thetotal weekly delivery of orgs!)If you add the dozens and dozens of Lower Grade Processes as given inExpanded Lower Grades to the VIII C/S HCO B of 10 Dec 68 and included this C/SSeries and its new development of Repair (Progress) and Return (Advance) programsyou would have the whole package of C/Sing.So the VIII actions are all valid.Auditor classes below VIII have this C/S Series. The AO C/S Course adds in theVIII actions as well.Any C/S who does not know well The Original Thesis, Dianetics: The Evolutionof a Science, Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health, Scientology 8-80 andScientology 8-8008 will go badly astray. It is vital to know these books and others inthis area, to know what one is trying to handle.Class VI (SHSBC) tapes and bulletins are all valid and vital to Lower Gradeauditing and C/Sing.-------------I trust this gives the C/S some idea of what is still “in”.It all is.

Errors in 2 way comm become masked since the procedure is loose.5. Earlier C/Ses on the case may have missed the easily missed 2 way commerrors.RULES OF C/Sing 2 WAY COMMA. The C/S must recognize that 2 way comm is auditing. Therefore it follows all therules of auditing.B. Any error that occurs in other auditing can occur in 2 way comm auditing. Errorsin a 2 way comm session must be carefully looked for as they easily can bemasked in the worksheet.C. Auditors must be persuaded by the C/S to make notation of auditing essentials in2 way comm as of senior importance to pc’s text (which is also made note of inthe W/S).D. The questions asked in 2 way comm can be very incorrect just as rote processescan be.E. An auditor must be trained as a 2 way comm auditor (Class II). Otherwise he willEvaluate, Q and A and commit other faults.F. If an ARC Break occurs early in a 2 way comm session and is not handled assuch the rest of the session is audited over an ARC Break and can put a pc into asad effect.G. A pc with a PT problem not being handled in the 2 way comm will get no gain.H. A pc with a W/H in a 2 way comm session will become critical, nattery and/or geta dirty needle.I. Two way comm processes must be flattened to F/N. If an F/N doesn’t occur thenthe subject didn’t read in the first place or the auditor Qed and Aed or evaluated orchanged the subject or the TRs were out or the pc’s ruds were out.54"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"J. A two way comm subject chosen must be tested for read in that session beforebeing used for 2 way comm. K. Improper 2 way comm questions can plunge the pc into an out rud situation notthen handled. “Is anything upsetting you?” or any mention of upsets by theauditor is the same as asking for an ARC Break. “Has anything been troubling—worrying you lately?” is the same as asking for a PTP. “Who aren’t you talkingto?” is asking for W/Hs.L. The subject of major processes should be kept out of 2 way comm C/Ses,auditors’ questions and 2 way comm assessment lists (ARC Brks, Problems,overts, changes or any major auditing subject, as they are too heavy, being thebuttons of the bank).M. The C/S should only let Class II or above auditors do 2 way comm sessions.N. A rud going out in a two way comm session must be put in by the auditor.O. A 2 way comm session should end in an F/N.P. Auditors whose 2 way comm sessions do not end in F/N must be taught to checkthe subject for read before using, not to Q and A, not to Evaluate and given arefresher on 2 way comm tapes and HCO Bs.Q. In a 2 way comm session that flubs the C/S must be careful to isolate the errorsjust as in any other auditing session that flubs and put them right.R. A 2 way comm subject that reads on test and doesn’t F/N on 2 way comm mustbe checked for O/R (if TA went up) and rehabbed by the 1965 Rehab method, orPrepchecked or just continued.-------------The whole point to all of this is that a 2 way comm session IS auditing.

This does not mean theystay out. In a few minutes or hours or days or years they can key back in.A pc will also de-stimulate in from 3 to 10 days usually. This means he “settlesout”. Thus a pc can be overrun into new engram chains (by life or an auditor), TA goesup, 3 to 10 days later the TA comes down.When a pc is audited to F/N VGIs and then a few minutes later has a high TA theusual reasons are1. Has had his comm chopped or full Dianetic or Scientology End Phenomenanot reached or2. Has been run on an unreading item or subject or3. Is overwhelmed or4. Has a lot of engrams keying in or5. Has been run in the past without full erasure of engrams or attaining EndPhenomena.6. Lists badly done or other misauditing cause a pc to feel bad and key inchains also.7.

(6) You use Repairlists (like L4A, LIB, etc) and other usual action. On (7) you make the pc get some restand if he can’t, make him go for a walk away until he is tired and then walk back andget some sleep.All these really add up to keyed in or unflat engram chains. Whether the pc canhandle them depends on Repair and the usual.56"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Of all these the past auditing without attaining EP on engram chains (whetherdone in Dianetics or Scientology) is a usual reason for a much audited pc to have a highTA.The answers to any high TA that won’t come down and to any pc whocontinually arrives at Examiner after an F/N VGI session end with his TA UP areA. Faulty auditing not letting pc go to Full Dn EP when runningengrams.B. A false auditing report (PR type report meaning promoting instead ofauditing).C. Too many engram chains in past restim by life or auditing.Any correct Standard Dianetic Auditing will eventually handle. But it is usual todo a PICTURE REMEDY (see HCO B 5 June 1969).A pc who has a chronic somatic would get programmed like this:I Repair (Progress) Pgm until pc feeling better.II Picture Remedy with all reading and interest items Dn triple full Dn EP.III Health Form—with all reading and interest items Dn triple full Dn EP.IV Somatics of the area with all reading and interest items Dn triple full Dn EP.V Run the engram chain of the incident (operation, accident, etc) he believes causedit. R3R triple.VI HF to F/N on the HF itself and attest full Dianetic result as per Class Chart.That’s maybe 50 hours, all done in Dianetic triples, of course, in steps II to VI.IF the Dianetic Auditing is standard and to Dianetic EP (F/N Cog VGIs) you willsee this pattern at the Examiner or a few minutes after session.First few sessionsTA 4.0 or more at Exam. Doubtful GIs.Next fewTA 3.75 and blowing down to 3.25 at Exam. GIs.Next fewTA 3.75 BD to F/N at Exam.

Errors such as running unreadingitems or firefights caused by out TRs or false auditing reports or Dn EP not reached atsession end or pc needing ruds put in at session starts would prevent this pattern fromhappening at the Examiner’s. So if the pattern doesn’t happen you know the auditing isgoofy or something is out which had better be found. One pc for instance had a hugew/h of having a disease and was audited over it for 2 years = auditing over a w/h andPTP = no case gain. Silly pc. But also a very dull C/S not to alert to some outness thereand find it. Another pc had a high TA and the fault was just that she never got anyauditing at all! So they kept operating on her!

But (see HCO B 24 May‘70, “Auditor’s Rights”, C/S Series 1), the auditor should not have accepted the C/S.The C/S could be too heavy, or the case needed a repair first or the processordered is not part of a proper program.HOURS SUCCESSFULLY AUDITED INCLUDES ONLY “WELL DONE” OR“VERY WELL DONE” SESSIONS.VERY WELL DONESAn auditor gets a “VERY WELL DONE” when the session by worksheet inspection,Exam Report inspection is:1. F/N VGIs at Examiner.2. The auditing is totally flubless and by the book.3. The whole C/S ordered was done without departure and to the expectedresult.NO MENTIONA no mention of well done or very well done or anything simply means:59"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"1. F/N did not get to Examiner.2. No major auditing errors exist in the session.FLUNKSA FLUNK is given when:1. The F/N did not get to Examiner and didn’t occur at session end.2. Major errors or flubs occurred like no EP, multiple somatic, unflown ruds,etc.3. The C/S was not followed or completed.4. Auditor’s Rights listed errors occurred.5. No F/N and BIs at Examiner.The exact error must be noted on the worksheet and in the next C/S along with theFlunk.FLUNK AND RETRAINWhen an auditor does not improve but continues to get NO MENTIONS andFLUNKS, he requires retraining.Such retraining must include:1. Cleaning up all Misunderstoods of tech.2. Cleaning up willingness to audit.3. Cleaning up overts on people and pcs.4. Examination by inspection of TRs.5. Starrating material missed or not grasped as per session troubles.INVALIDATIONInvalidative remarks should not be made by a C/S. Experience has shown they dono good and also do harm.But there are 2 methods of invalidating an auditor’s auditing:1. Let him go on flubbing and getting no results.2. Direct invalidation of his intentions or future or potential.In 1, nearly all auditors who stop auditing never really knew how to audit in thefirst place or have gross misunderstoods or have accumulated intentional orunintentional overts on pcs or have been too harshly invalidated. When they don’treally grasp the ease and simplicity of auditing they get into other troubles.A really well trained, smooth auditor never gets any real charge on his case on thesubject of auditing.When you let an auditor flub, the whole subject gets invalidated and he loses hisvalue because he goes into doubt. This can be said with complete confidence today asthe whole of Dianetics and Scientology is there and it works very very well indeed IFIT IS USED AND IF THE C/SING AND AUDITING IS CORRECT ANDFLUBLESS.60"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"AUDITOR HANDLINGThe C/S is really not just the Case Supervisor, he is also the auditors’ handler.Like a boxer’s trainer or a star’s director, the C/S handles his guys. They are all abit different, auditors. There are prima donnas and meek mousey ones and steady-onones and all kinds.They get the credit for the sessions from the pcs most often. They really don’t likenot to be C/Sed.And they VALUE the well dones and the very well dones and they flinch at theflunks. And the honest ones know all about it before they turn it in. And some don’tmention the flub but think you’re a fool if you miss it.So it’s important to have a constant in assigning what the auditor is given for thesession.WELL DONE AUDITING HOURS are all that’s valid for a stat.So a C/S must be very exact and correct in his determination of well done, verywell done, no mention and (forlornly) a flunk.This should remove argument from the matter and bring certainty.

Review patches them all up to F/NVGIs all okay. Then a C/S C/Ses to Review the case to repair the errors. The case feelsinvalidated, caves in, needs further repair.I have seen more than one folder where this cycle has been done three times! Inone of these an action had to be taken to patch up a goof so the pc could go back onto agrade. The goof was patched up to F/N VGIs. The correct action would have been toput the pc back on the incomplete grade. But no, a new Review cycle was laid out,audited, pc caved in. A new cycle to repair this was entered in upon. It was successful.The pc got F/N VGIs at Exam. The C/S ordered a new Review of the case, the casecaved in, was then patched up and finally got an F/N VGIs. And was ordered to bereviewed ..........Studying what was wrong with the cases I found the above. I ordered anassessment of a list, got “unnecessary actions” and got the cases back onto theincomplete cycle of the grade and they did fine.This can be done with a grade. It was the fault of early Power.UNDERSHOOTING would be to leave a cycle incomplete and go off tosomething else.Example: Case sent to Review or given a Review session to repair goofs. Onegoof is handled but there are three to handle. Case returned to the grade before being setup.This can be so bad that the case never made any grade at all.The modern Repair (Progress) Pgm as outlined in this C/S series takes care ofthis.QUICKIE GRADES AND ACTIONSQuickie grades left us with a totality of incomplete cases.You look over a folder and you see the pc at “OT IV”.

He has aches and pains, problems, makes people wrong.62"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Probably he could be audited for another thousand hours without ever comingright!

Finally, his chronic somatics gone, he would F/Non the Health Form and that would complete his Dianetics with his attestation.And so on right on up the Grades, each one done fully to the voluntary declare forthat grade as per the Grade and Class Chart.In doing Dianetics, Grades, etc you still have to get in ruds and handle the case soit is set up for each major action and repair the flubs at once when they occur.While completing an action you have to keep the case running, not audit overARC Brks, PTPs, W/Hs and flubs.The best answer is NO FLUBS. But when they occur they must be repaired in 24hours.When repaired (and not re-repaired and re-re-repaired with overshoots) you getthe case back on the same cycle that was incomplete.COMPLETE CASESA case is not complete unless the lowest incomplete Grade Chart action iscomplete and then each completed in turn on up.As you look over current folders who have had years of auditing, some of themyou generally don’t find any completed actions and you do find overshoots onReviews.It is not the least bit hard to handle these cases.

Thus an FES is not vital in all cases.I like to have an FES done so I can compare areas covered by the pc in 2-waycomm and be sure they come up in subsequent repair sessions.Also where I can see a lot of bad lists existed, I want to be able to assure they gethandled.Thus an FES is useful.On Flag, an FES is carefully done so as to detect areas of out tech in the world.This is called “the Flub Catch System”.Auditors and C/Ses so detected are sent to cramming in their areas to smooth outtheir tech knowledge or TRs, all to improve delivery of tech.Flub Catch makes an FES vital on Flag.Higher orgs have a similar interest in an FES.HALTING DELIVERYTo halt delivery because of a missing folder or to do a long time-consuming FESis of course contrary to the need to deliver auditing and can result in a no-auditingsituation worse than a Blind Repair.65"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"BLIND REPAIRWhen no FES is done, one is doing a Blind Repair. The Progress Pgm andAdvance Pgm may have holes in them.However there are only five areas of danger:1. Flubbed lists.2. A bad series of evaluative sessions should be detected and directly handled.3. Flubbed Power.4. Extended or flubbed Interiorization.5. Missed grades.If a C/S doesn’t know about these it may be that the case will not properly repairand he also does not know what Advance Program to do.But as these are specific areas they can be done on a Blind Repair by making theminto a list and getting them meter checked.Example: Pc has lost his folder. Has been audited for several years on and off.One can clear the idea of lists “Someone written down items you say to a question” andsee if it gets a read and if so do L4A Method Three “On Lists”. One can ask if anyauditor ever told the pc what to think and if that reads 2-way comm or prepcheck thosesessions by that auditor. Power can be checked by rehab unless the person has goneClear on the Clearing Course since at which time Power will not need repair. Thecommands of Interiorization Rundown can be checked with 2-way comm or rehabbed.What won’t rehab you run. Missed Grades can be checked, rehabbed or run includingany Expanded Grades. The pc usually recognizes the process if it has been run.Thus one can wander through a Blind Repair without fouling up the case and addto it the inevitable actions common to all Progress Pgms.SUMMARYAn FES has value. It is valuable to the pc to get one done. It is a long andextensive action. It can be sold directly or removed from hours bought. It is of vastinterest in training auditors and should be done by already trained internes or speciallyhired auditors. It is NOT done by a C/S and it is NOT used to halt all delivery ofauditing and jam up the C/S lines. A lost or delayed folder is not a barrier to a very welltrained C/S who has starrated a C/S Course. An FES is very useful and tends toeradicate any mystery for a C/S.  L.

This alsooccurred in Power when it was run all in one day). The auditor would attain a bona fidefull dial F/N. The pc was still cogniting, still in a big win. The auditor would “clear thenext process command”, he would see an F/N. He would “clear the next processcommand”, and see an F/N.BUT IT WAS THE SAME F/N!Result was that processes 2 and 3 WERE NEVER RUN ON THE CASE.This is really what is meant by “Quickie Grades”.In 1958 we got real Releases. You could not kill the F/N for days, weeks.Several processes had this effect. Today’s real Clear also goes this way. Youcouldn’t kill the F/N with an axe.By running a lot of Level Zero processes, for instance, you can get a realswinging unkillable F/N.It not only gets to the Examiner, it comes in at the start of the next day’s session!Now if in one session you ran all of Level Zero and went on up to Level One,you would just be auditing a persistent F/N. The pc would get no benefit at all fromLevel One. He’s still going “Wow” on Level Zero.If you ran Level Zero with one process that got a big wide floating F/N and then“ran” Level I, II, III and IV, you would have just a Level Zero Release. The pc’s bankwas nowhere to be found. So next week he has problems (Level I) or a Service Fac(Level IV) and he is only a Grade Zero yet it says right there in Certs and Awards loghe’s a Grade IV. So now we have a “Grade IV” who has Level I, II, III and IVtroubles!A session that tries to go beyond a big dial-wide drifting floating F/N onlydistracts the pc from his win. BIG WIN.Any big win (F/N dial-wide, Cog, VGIs) gives you this kind of persistent F/N.You at least have to let it go until tomorrow and let the pc have his win.That is what is meant by letting the pc have his win. When you get one of thesedial-wide F/Ns, Cog, VGIs WOW you may as well pack it up for the day.67"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"GRADUAL WIDENINGIn running a Dianetic chain to basic in triple you will sometimes see in onesession a half dial on Flow 1, 3/4 of a dial on Flow 2, a full dial on Flow 3.Or you may have 4 subjects to two-way comm or prepcheck in one session.

It’s persistentat least for that day. Do any more and it’s wasted.If an auditor has never seen this he had better get his TR0 bullbait flat for 2 hoursat one unflunked go and his other TRs in and drill out his flubs. For that’s what’ssupposed to happen.F/Ns on pcs audited up to (for that session) a persistent F/N always get to theExaminer.If you only have a “small F/N” it won’t get to the Examiner. However, on somepcs maybe that’s good enough. May take him several sessions, each one getting a finalsession F/N a bit wider. Then he gets an F/N that gets to the Examiner. After that, wellaudited on a continuing basis, the F/N lasts longer and longer.One day the pc comes into session with a dial-wide floating swinging F/N andanything you say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that F/N.It’s a real Release man. It may last weeks, months, years.Tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up theremaining hours (if sold by the hour) as undelivered. Or if sold by result, chalk up theresult.If the F/N is truly persistent he will have no objections. If it isn’t, he will object.So have him come back tomorrow and carry on whatever you were doing.SUMMARYThe technical bug back of Quickie Grades or Quickie Power was the PersistentF/N.This is not to be confused with a Stage 4 (sweep, stick, sweep, stick) or an ARCBroke needle (pc Bad Indicators while F/Ning).This is not to be used to refuse all further auditing to a pc.It is to be used to determine when to end a series of major actions in a session.LRH: rr.rd L.

This neglect gives us (a) FlubbyAuditing (b) Fad tech.If auditing is flubby it is the C/S who is responsible. In the first place hepermitted bad course training without screaming. In the second place he does notpersuade or force auditors to correct their tech in cramming after flubs.Since flubby auditing is the primary reason for no results, an area where tech isbad tends to ride fads or grab “the newest and latest” and hope it will crack caseswhereas doing the usual without flubs is what cracks the cases.If I find an auditor whose sessions I am C/Sing has failed to flatten a chain, Iassume not that the pc is difficult but that the auditor does not know about (1) Onlyrunning items that read, (2) Multiple somatics, (3) Narrative chains and that his TRs arebad. I spot what it is from the session worksheet and say what it is and order theauditor to cramming (or to be crammed if there is no cramming) on the materials and onTRs always.I cannot C/S with flubby auditors. The pile of C/S folders grows. Any review hasto be reviewed and my C/Ses just aren’t getting done. If auditors I am C/Sing for aregreen I can count on a 4+ times increase in my C/Sing time. If my auditors are flubbyC/Sing that should require 11/2 hours takes 61/2 hours. This is by actual timing.I have no objection to working with green or newly trained auditors. BUT IF IDO I RETRAIN THEM.The C/S who accepts an auditor from any course as a trained auditor is anoptimist.There are three training stages.A. Course Study, theory and practical.B. Student Auditing.C. Professional Auditing.The C/S has to do with C. When A and B are very poor the job at C is muchharder so the C/S should call it forcefully to attention of Course Supervisors. And thenget a fast retrain going under himself.Retraining is an inevitable part of a C/S’s job. No matter how good the coursemay have been the actual practice of auditing gives the new auditor different importancevalues. Also his hat has changed from a student hat to a real auditor’s hat.69"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"As a C/S works with an auditor he trains him. He also may order the new auditoraudited.Essentially the C/S has to shift the new auditor’s hat from a “what’s it say?” to a“Now I do.”With a whole green crew of auditors I give as a C/S a daily auditors’ conference.I make sure my Tech Services is on the ball so auditors get in 5 or 6 hours in 5 or 6hours, not in 10 or 12 hours while they wait for pcs or go find them. That gives themauditor admin and study time. Then I can have a conference. This conference does notviolate any ivory tower as I don’t C/S on their data of pcs. I find their questions and getthem answered and I give them the reasons behind certain C/Ses.Then daily daily daily I meet any flub with an order to cramming on the materialflubbed and on TRs. And I keep their overts pulled.A green auditor with me as a C/S has a very arduous time of it. There is noinvalidation. Quite the contrary. The message is YOU CAN AUDIT. YOU CAN GETRESULTS. GET WISED UP AND GET ON WITH IT.One flub, one retrain in cramming.A lot of auditors are around who learned to audit with me as a C/S after theirtraining. In the majority of cases they became fantastic auditors. In some few cases theywent elsewhere before they could be fully trained.The magic of it all is simply: 1 flub, 1 retrain in cramming on that point.Mostly I didn’t even pull them off the pc.The fuzzy muzzy state of most graduated students needs handling. It is handledby the C/S.The object of a C/S is to handle and improve cases. He can’t do that with flubbyauditors. So he has to make auditors out of students. If he does he can then achieve hisobject.If the C/S wears this part of his hat he really wins. He seldom has to unravelanything tough. He just C/Ses and the auditors audit EVENTUALLY. But every newauditor he gets is certain to lengthen the C/S’s working day and lessen his resultsunless the C/S realizes that there is ON THE JOB TRAINING and gets it done.Training includes the auditor’s staff hat and his knowledge of Tech and QualDivisions. This would be true even in a Franchise or the field. They might not have thedivisions but they have all the functions!Recently a C/S had to get about 60 people audited fast. She had seven auditorsassigned. She did not assure that these auditors were knowledgeable on the coursesthey had had and she did not wear the training hat of a C/S. She wound up with herselfand one auditor doing the whole 60. The excuse was, the other auditors “couldn’taudit”.It would have been far faster in terms of audited pc-hours to have rapidly crash-programmed the seven auditors through a refresher, cleaned up their misunderstoodsand overts in a co-audit and then, using them, to shove them into cramming on thematerials of any flub and TRs for each goof. She would have made seven auditors intostars and she would have gotten the 60 pcs fully audited completely and rapidly withminimal flubs. She would have had 60 Dianetic and Expanded Grade completions, 60terrific beings AND IN LESS TIME.Morale goes to pot only when auditors do not get results.70"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"Her basic error was assuming auditors should be able to audit. This isn’t true ofany auditor who has not served an apprenticeship under a competent C/S.An auditor who has been auditing 10 years, when he starts to audit for me thefirst time, I put on my C/S training hat and no matter how good or how poor he waswhen he began I make him a better auditor.A C/S who doesn’t do this is letting the team down and badly.A C/S who doesn’t do this will spend hours daily trying to puzzle out the solutionto messes made.A C/S who doesn’t do this fills up a field with flubbed cases regardless of hisown skill in C/Sing. He is liable to sink into doubt, then treason and blow.The C/S who wears his training hat and does do this leads a smooth life, isrespected by his auditors and is valuable beyond gold.To do this a C/S must himself be able to audit and to know his materials wellenough to state which ones have to be crammed and never introduce strange ideas.Such a C/S will never have a revolt and will never have to dream something up orride new fads because he is getting excellent results straight along for a happy org andpublic.I trust a C/S to do this.

I must say that it requires a bit of confronting.The alleviation of the condition of insanity has also been accomplished now andthe footnote in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health concerning futureresearch into this field can be considered fulfilled.The things a C/S should know about insanity are as follows:HIGHER PERCENTAbout 15% to 20% of the human race apparently is insane or certainly a muchhigher percent than was estimated.The truly insane do not necessarily act insane visibly. They are not the psychiatricobvious cases who go rigid for years or scream for days. This is observed only in thelast stages or during temporary stress.Under apparent social behavior the continual crimes knowingly committed by theinsane are much more vicious than ever has been catalogued in psychiatric texts.The actions of the insane are not “unconscious”. They are completely aware ofwhat they are doing.All insane actions are entirely justified and seem wholly rational to them. As theyhave no reality on the harmful and irrational nature of their conduct it does not oftenregister on an E-Meter.The product of their post duties is destructive but is excused as ignorance orerrors.As cases in normal processing they roller coaster continually.They nearly always have a fixed emotional tone. It does not vary in nearly allinsane people. In a very few it is cyclic, high then low.All characteristics classified as those of the “suppressive person” are in fact thoseof an insane person.The easiest ways for a C/S to detect the insane are:1. Pretending to do a post or duties, the real consistent result is destructive tothe group in terms of breakage, lost items, injured business, etc.2. The case is no case gain or roller coaster and is covered under “PTSsymptoms”.72"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"3. They are usually chronically physically ill.4. They have a deep but carefully masked hatred of anyone who seeks to helpthem.5. The result of their “help” is actually injurious.6. They often seek transfers or wish to leave.7. They are involved in warfare with conflicts around them which are invisibleto others. One wonders how they can be so involved or get so involved inso much hostility.TYPESThe German psychiatric 1500 or so “different types of insanity” are just differentsymptoms of the same cause. There is only one insanity and from it springs differentmanifestations. Psychiatry erred in calling these different types and trying to inventdifferent treatments.DEFINITIONInsanity can now be precisely defined.The definition is:INSANITY IS THE OVERT OR COVERT BUT ALWAYS COMPLEX ANDCONTINUOUS DETERMINATION TO HARM OR DESTROY.Possibly the only frightening thing about it is the cleverness with which it can behidden.Whereas a sane person can become angry or upset and a bit destructive for shortperiods, he or she recovers. The insane mask it, are misemotional continuously and donot recover. (Except by modern processing.)THE NATURE OF MANMan is basically good. This is obvious. For when he begins to do evil he seeks todestroy his memory in order to change and seeks to destroy his body. He seeks tocheck his evil impulses by inhibiting his own skill and strength.He can act in a very evil fashion but his basic nature then makes it mandatory thathe lessens himself in many ways.The towering “strength” of a madman is a rarity and is compensated by efforts atself-destruction.Man’s mortality, his “one life” fixation, all stem from his efforts to check himself,obliterate his memory in a fruitless effort to change his conduct and his self-destructivehabits and impulses and losses of skills and abilities.As this rationale proves out completely in processing and fits all cases observed,we have for the first time proof of his actual nature.As only around 20% are insane, and as those who previously worked in themental field were themselves mainly insane, Man as a whole has been assigned an evilrepute. Govemments, where such personalities exist, listen to the opinion of the insaneand apply the characteristic of 20% to the entire hundred percent.This gives an 80% wrong diagnosis. Which is why mental science itself wasdestructive when used by states.73"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"TECHNIQUESThe only technique available at this writing which will benefit the insane iscontained in all the overt-motivator sequences and Grade II technology.At Flag at this writing new improvement on this exists but it is so powerful thatslight errors in use can cause a psychotic break in the insane. It therefore will only beexported for use by specially trained persons and this programming will require quite awhile.MEANWHILE it helps the C/S to know and use these firm rules:ALWAYS RUN DIANETIC TRIPLES.Never run Singles. The overt side (Flow 2) is vital. If you only run Flow 1Motivators, the pc will not recover fully. Further running Flow 1 (Motivator only) anypsychotic being processed will not recover but may even trigger into a psychotic break.If one never ran anything but motivators, psychotic manifestations would not erase.DEPEND ON EXPANDED GRADE II TECHNOLOGY TO EASE OFF ORHANDLE THE INSANE.Don’t keep asking what’s been done to him as he’ll trigger.A new discovery on this is that when you run out the motivator the person gets ahigher reality on his overts. If you ran out all his motivators he would have no reasonfor his overts. If these are not then run out he might cave himself in.PATTERN OF BEHAVIORThe APPARENT pattern of insane behavior is to come in (ask for processing, goon staff, etc) with the advertised intention of being helped or helping, then mess upeither as a pc or on post, then state how bad it all is and leave. It looks obvious enough.He came, found it bad, left.That is only the APPARENT behavior. APPARENT REASONS.Based on numerous cases, this is the real cycle. Hearing of something good thatmight help these hateful awful rotten nasty people, the psycho comes in, wrecks this,upsets that, caves in this one, chops up that one and WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS“NO!” the psychotic either(a) Caves himself in physically or(b) Runs away.The psychotic is motivated by intent to harm.If he realizes he is harming things he shouldn’t, he caves himself in. If he isafraid he will be found out, he runs.In the psychotic the impulse is quite conscious.CONCLUSIONNone of this is very nice. It is hard to confront. Even I find it so.Freud thought all men had a hidden monster in them for he dealt mainly with thepsychotic and their behavior was what he saw.All men are not like this. The percentage that are is greater than I supposed but isa long way from all men.74"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Sometimes one only becomes aware of these when things are getting worked onand improved. They stay on as long as it can be made bad or there is hope it can bedestroyed. Then when attention is given to improvement they blow.Artists, writers often have these types hanging around them as there is someoneor something there to be destroyed. When success or failure to destroy or possibledetection appears on the scene they blow, often as destructively as possible.Orgs are subjected to a lot of this. A psychotic sometimes succeeds in blowing offgood staff. And then sooner or later realizes how evil he is acting and sickens or leaves.The society is not geared to any of this at all. The insane walk around wreckingthe place and decent people think it’s “human nature” or “inevitable” or a “badchildhood”.As of this writing the insane can be handled. The proof of any pudding is theprocessing. And this is successful. It is also rather swift. But, as I say, it is so swift thespecial technique has to be done by the specially trained flubless auditor.For a long while I’ve realized that we would have to be able to handle insanepeople as the psychiatrist is fading. I have had opportunity to work on the problem.And have it handled. Until it is fully released, the C/S will benefit greatly fromknowing the above as these come on his lines far more often than he has suspected.The insane can be helped.

It goes flat on Secondary F2, let ussay. The auditor keeps on going past the win.“This will hang up the Rundown.“One of the ways an overrun occurs is the pc goes exterior during it.

Auditor keeps going on with the RD.”—LRH (HCO B 24 Sept 71, ‘‘Urgent—Interiorization Rundown’’)REPAIR OF INT“If even years after an Int RD the pc has a high TA or a low TA, then Int trouble isat once suspected and the original Int RD and any repair of it is suspected and must behandled. “—LRH (From the LRH original HCO B C/S Series 35R, Revised 16 Dec 71,‘‘Interiorization Errors”) (Handle it by HCO B 29 Oct 71, “Int Rundown Correction ListRevised”.)TWO-WAY COMMThere is a two-way comm step that follows a day or so after an InteriorizationRundown .An auditor doing this step, preferably the same auditor, MUST BE CHECKED OUTON TWO-WAY COMM.No C/S should permit any auditor to do any 2-way comm until the auditor has beenchecked out on HCO PL 20 July 1970, Issue III, “Two-Way Comm Checksheet”. Onecan obtain these tapes easily from Pubs (as the Sea Org has recently forced in this lineand quality and delivery). Pending such tapes one can certainly get the rest of thematerials on the checksheet done by the auditor and let him do 2-way comm while beingvery watchful as a C/S.C/SING INTThe correcting of an Interiorization Rundown is far harder than making sure thatauditors can do the usual in the first place.Nearly all a C/S’s hard work comes from auditors not well trained on courses(indifferent courses) and failing to check auditors out well on the materials beforepermitting them to deliver a new rundown.The correction of Int is hard since until it is complete, other auditing is inadvisable.One, however, gets the Int Rundown done.“INT IS A REMEDY“The Int RD is not understood as a REMEDY. It is not something you do on allpcs.“Pc goes Exterior in auditing.“Later his TA goes high.“Then you do an Int RD.“You test Int for read as above. If it BDs you do an Int RD.“You just don’t do one because a pc goes exterior.“One reason unnecessary Int RDs get done is that the Registrar sells one. Thatmakes the Reg a C/S. So the C/S and auditor run it.77"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"“Maybe it wasn’t needed.“So if it wasn’t needed it will eventually have to be repaired.”—LRH (HCO B 2Sept 71, “Urgent—Interiorization Rundown”) (Repair with an Int RD CorrectionList Revised, HCO B 29 Oct 1971.)The Interiorization Rundown is a REMEDY designed to permit the pc to be furtheraudited after he has gone exterior.The Int Rundown is NOT meant to be sold or passed off as a method ofexteriorizing a pc. This is very important.It is general auditing on usual Dianetics and Scientology actions that brings aboutExteriorization.When the pc goes or is found to be exterior one then orders the InteriorizationRundown. Otherwise the TA will misbehave.The rundown is a REMEDY USED AFTER EXTERIORIZATION HASOCCURRED BY REASON OF GENERAL AUDITING.Anxiety to get exterior will prompt a pc to buy and a Registrar to sell anInteriorization Rundown. It is in effect just more auditing as far as the Registrar isconcerned. When a pc has gone exterior the Registrar can insist on his buying enoughhours for the remedy.The Int Rundown stabilizes the exteriorization and makes it possible to audit the pcfurther.DISABILITYIf an auditor can’t smoothly audit a rundown as simple as an Int Rundown, then heis exposed as being unable to run Standard Dianetics and should be cleared of hismisunderstoods and overts and retrained.The only real trouble one gets into on an Int Rundown stems from the inability ofthe auditor to run a smooth, good TRed R3R session. Pcs are not hard to run on it.C/S WINSA C/S cannot win at all if he is continually having to make up for flubby auditingby the auditor.Therefore the C/S must be very sure his auditors are fully checked out on thingsthey are to run before running them.If there is no Qual Staff Training Officer or no Cramming, a C/S can fully afford todo the training and cramming himself. Otherwise he will lose far more than that time inC/Sing for auditors not checked out.By the skill of his auditors you know the C/S. Not by his unusual solutions afterflubs.The Int Rundown is too easy to do to have any trouble—the trouble comes whenthe auditors are not checked out beforehand, starrate and in clay on new things the are torun.L.

This can hang up a pc badly if the item was infact a reading item or question. It does not get handled and exists in records as “Noread” when in fact it DID read.THEREFORE ALL DIANETIC AUDITORS WHOSE ITEMSOCCASIONALLY “DON’T READ” AND ALL SCIENTOLOGY AUDITORS WHOGET LIST QUESTIONS THAT DON’T READ MUST BE CHECKED OUT ONTHIS HCO B IN QUAL OR BY THE C/S OR SUPERVISOR.These errors come under the heading of Gross Auditing Errors as they affectmetering.1. An Item or Question is said to “Read” when the needle falls. Not when it stops orslows on a rise. A tick is always noted and in some cases becomes a wide read.2. The read is taken when the pc first says it or when the question is cleared. THISis the valid time of read. It is duly marked (plus any blow down). THIS readingdefines what is a reading item or question. CALLING IT BACK TO SEE IF ITREAD IS NOT A VALID TEST as the surface charge may be gone but the item orquestion will still run or list.3. Regardless of any earlier statements or material on READING ITEMS, an itemdoes not have to read when the auditor calls it to be a valid item for runningengrams or listing. The test is did it read when the pc first said it on originating itor in Clearing it?4. That an item or question is marked as having read is sufficient reason to run it oruse it or list it. Pc Interest, in Dianetics, is also necessary to run it, but that it didnot read again is no reason to not use it.5. When listing items the auditor must have an eye on the meter NOT necessarily thepc and must note on the list he is making the extent of read and any BD and howmuch. THIS is enough to make it a “reading item” or “reading question”.6. In Clearing a listing Question the auditor watches the meter, NOT necessarily thepc and notes any read while clearing the question.7. An additional calling of the item or question to see if it read is unnecessary andnot a valid action if the item or question read on origination or Clearing.8. That an item is marked as having read on an earlier Dianetic list is enough (alsochecking interest) to run it with no further read test.9. To miss seeing a read on an origin or clearing is a Gross Auditing Error.79"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"10. Failing to mark on the list or worksheet the read and any BD seen during pcorigination or clearing the question is a Gross Auditing Error.EYESIGHTAuditors who miss reads or have poor eyesight should be tested and should wearthe proper glasses while auditing.GLASSESThe rims of some glasses could obstruct seeing the meter while the auditor islooking at the worksheet or pc.If this is the case the glasses should be changed to another type with broadervision.WIDE VISIONA good auditor is expected to see his meter, pc and worksheet all at one time. Nomatter what he is doing he should always notice any meter movement if the meterneedle moves.If he cannot do this he should use an Azimuth Meter and not put paper over itsglass but should do his worksheet looking through the glass at his pen and the paper—the original design purpose of the Azimuth Meter. Then even while writing he sees themeter needle move as it is in his line of vision.CONFUSIONSAny and all confusions as to what is a “reading item” or “reading question”should be fully cleaned up on any auditor as such omissions or confusions can beresponsible for case hang-ups and needless repairs.NO READAny comment that an item or question “did not read” should be at once suspectedby a C/S and checked with this HCO B on the auditor.Actually non-Reads, a non-reading item or question means one that did not readwhen originated or cleared and also did not read when called.One can still call an item or question to get a read. That it now reads is fine. But ifit has never read at all, the item will not run and such a list will produce no item on it.It is not forbidden to call an item or question to test it for read. But it is a uselessaction if the item or question read on origination by the pc or clearing it with him.IMPORTANTThe data in this HCO B, if not known, can cost case failures. Thus it must bechecked out on auditors.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1971by L.

He leaves this blank.The correctly Admined folder is then given to Tech Services which routes it(usually with the Auditor’s other folders for the day) to the C/S.The C/S looks it over (it is HIS final responsibility for the case being run right).The C/S looks to see if the Examiner form taken by the Examiner at session endF/Ned. If it did not he leaves the grade line blank as it is a No Grade session (see F/N81"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"and well done hours) as the Auditor gets no hour credit for the session. If the C/S andother Admin is ok he writes OK with his initial in the session grade space. If none of it isokay he leaves it blank and does the C/S form or programs completely new. In this lastcase he enters a subtract figure in his log for the auditing time for the week against thatAuditor’s name.If the Exam form F/Ned, but the Admin is not okay and the session actions were notokay the C/S writes “Well Done by Exam” on his own new C/S in its proper place andignores the form and subtracts the Admin time in his book to subtract the Admin fromthe Auditor’s week’s stat.If the session was not okay with no F/N at Exams yet the Admin and next C/S areok, the Auditor loses the session time in the C/S but gets the Admin time credited to hisweek’s stat. The C/S subtracts the session time in his book, not the Admin time.Of course, as we hope is usually the case, if the Auditor did the C/S, did a correctsession, got an F/N at Exam and did the Admin and next C/S is correct, then the C/S marks“Very well done” in the blank space for session grade with his initial. After inspection,this would be the sole action of the C/S regarding that folder.By the C/S writing in the session grade (Very well done, well done, okay, flunk, tocramming) the Auditor is receiving acknowledgement for his work and is not just ackinghimself.THE NEW LINEThe Ideal Folder-C/S line can shift the number of well done hours from a ceiling of250-300 to 600-800 with one C/S. No matter how many Auditors an org has, older linesput a 250-300 top ceiling on the org’s well done hours.When hours could go above 600 due to the available Auditors (20 or 30), a newparallel line has to be manned by a new C/S, new D of P and another Examiner and moreTech Services personnel.Despite how hard the C/S and anyone else in tech works, a line not so run willceiling at about 250 hours, no matter how many Auditors are hired.A C/S using the old lines can C/S for about 5 working Auditors only with the linerunning any old way. And even so will work himself half to death.In trying to get pcs handled, Auditors will be added. The C/S will not be able tohandle his job. The line, being faulty, gets pegged at about 250 hours no matter how hardthe C/S and Admin people work.With the same C/S and Tech Services people, and a correct new line, 24 to 30Auditors will be kept busy at their 5 hours a day (given auditing rooms) and the stat willbe able to rise to 600 to 800.NEW SEQUENCE1.

Tech Services (having a duplicate list) begins sending pcs to him (using TechPages).3. The Auditor gives the session.4.

He sends theExam form (hand route) to Tech Services.82"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"6. The Auditor returns at once to his auditing room and a Tech Page has a pc therewaiting for him.7.

Fed the folders rapidly by the Folder Page who is standing in the C/S area, the C/Sdoes his C/S work. If the Folder Page is fast, removing folders and putting the newone in, chasing up data and other bits for the C/S, the time of C/Sing even whendone very carefully will be found to average 3 to 5 minutes a folder even whensome require full programming (but not FESing). This makes a ceiling of about100 folders (sessions) a day for the C/S, an output of 30 Auditors. Needless to saythe C/S and the Auditors have to know their business and Qual Cramming is usedextensively both for new material and for flubs both in auditing and C/Sing byAuditors.16. The Folder Page gets the folders over to the D of P office preserving the piles perAuditor as much as possible.The C/S posts the data he wants Auditors to know or do on the AUDITORS’BOARD of the Auditors’ Admin Room. He turns in his Cramming Orders into theD of P basket. This finishes his actions.Where there is a senior Review C/S there is a hot spur line from the C/S to the seniorC/S and back to the C/S. This is not necessarily an instant line. It can be a 12 hourlag line. In orgs where a C/O or Exec Dir or Product Officer or Org Officer is also avery skilled C/S this hot line would probably be in. New tech in use, fantasticcompletions and utter dog cases nobody can make anything out of go on thissenior C/S hot spur line. There are very few of these, only two or three a day in avery busy org. The senior C/S “does” these and sends them back to the C/S. Theyare then sent on as usual to the D of P.17. The Director of Processing comes on duty very early. The C/Sed folders will all bethere. The D of P has assignment master sheets that are kept up by the D of P.The D of P does the day’s schedules, a list for each Auditor. The lists preferablyhave a few too many pcs on them.The D of P can tell what Class of Auditor is required for the next session becausethe Auditor has marked it in in the upper right-hand corner of the C/S for the nextsession.When the D of P has the lists done the folders are placed in the “leaving” rack ofTech Services and Tech Services, now up and about, is given the lists and gets towork on the scheduling board, moving the names about to agree with the lists.Tech Services does any room shifts or handlings at this time.18. The D of P now goes to the Auditor Admin Room and begins to muster Auditorsfrom her muster list as they come in and gets them over to Tech Services.83"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"19. A Cramming personnel will be in there trying to get any crammings scheduled.20. Tech Services hands out folders (which are in neat piles for each Auditor) andschedules to the Auditors as they turn up and handles any arguments or shifts insequence.21. Tech Pages are on phones or running to round up pcs and get them going tosessions, which work continues all day.22. The D of P interviews any hung-up or curious pcs or as requested by the C/S or getsnew Auditors or keeps up Admin. This goes on until the C/S comes in when theDofP is off.23. The Auditor picking up his folders begins the cycle all over again at ( 1 ) above.ABOVE 600When the well done hours go above 600 a week, A WHOLE NEW HGC is put induplicating the first, with its own C/S, D of P, T/S, auditing rooms and Auditor AdminRoom. It would be HGC Section Two or HGC2 with the original being HGC1 .A special second Cramming would have to be provided in Qual for it.At first they would share new hours and build up independently. More HGCs areadded to the Department at each multiple 600 wd hours.SENIORSThe two chief seniors in the area are the C/S (for tech) and the D of P (for Auditorsand bodies).It is the D of P who must see that Auditors exist and are on post.It is Tech Services who sees pcs are rounded up and audited. The D of T/S isactually in charge of pcs and all folder files and all board keep-up work.The D of P should have some tech training. The D of T/S need not have any. TheC/S of course is the Tech Expert and should be an HSST.If there are no Auditors it is the D of P’s neck.If there are no C/Ses it is the C/S’s neck.If there are no folders it is the D of T/S’s neck.And if there are no auditing rooms it is the D of T/S’s neck.If signed-up scheduled pcs don’t get to session it is the D of T/S’s neck.If there are no NEW pcs it is the D of P’s neck who should begin to shoot DissemSecs and Registrars and procure new pcs on a by-pass for the org.From this a table of seniors and duties can be made.CRAMMINGYou will notice no pcs are sent to Review on this new line. Review actions are donein Tech as a patch-up in Tech. The Qual Sec is responsible for overall tech quality BUTDOES IT BY CRAMMING C/Ses or Auditors.Thus Cramming is a busy street.Cramming must be good, check-outs excellent.If an Auditor doesn’t grasp a C/S he has received he gets help from Cramming.84"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Auditors new to the HGC are given a fast hard grooving in in Cramming or a QualInterne Course. (New Auditors never audit until grooved in.)Tech will be as good as the Cramming Officer can cram.This line is grooved in by the HAS and kept in by Qual. Or if there is no Qual, it iskept in by the HAS who will find no Qual very embarrassing.DUMMY RUNThe line should be dummy run by folders, “pcs” and Auditors until theyunderstand it.People are often totally unaware of lines and get very sloppy.Thus this line has to be drilled hard on old and new tech personnel. All must knowthis exact line.It is a good line.Fully in, it raises the well done hours stat from 250 per week maximum at totaloverload to an easy 600 to 800.Auditors must audit five hours a day, 25 minimum per week of well done hours forany bonus to be paid at all. In the SO they get no pay at all much less bonuses if short ontheir 25.Tech Services and an unenergetic D of P or a bad Dissem Sec and Registrar set-upcan cause a no pc situation. And often do unless pushed.But counting FESes and Admin in on an Auditor’s wd time helps slack periods toeven out. And one Auditor can FES and program folders for others or from files if he isleft adrift and short-timed by the D of P or D of T/S or until the Tech Division forces theDissem Div and Distribution Div to really get on the ball and wear their hats on pc flow.PROCUREMENTThe D of P has always had new pc procurement responsibility when all else failed oreven when it didn’t.Old folders, for example, are a marvelous source of new auditing repairs andintensives. An FES done on an old folder and a letter to “come in and get audited beforeyou fall apart” is excellent pc procurement, usually neglected by Registrars. Anyprocurement by a D of P is legitimate.Auditors who have no pcs can write procurement letters and have for 20 years.SUMMARYThis is a beautiful line. It has been piloted hard.It will serve as well as it is checked out, drilled in and used.This line is the key to affluence from pcs alone.(But if the org isn’t training Auditors heavily, you’ll soon have no Auditors to beon it and the org will not gain its high income low cost cushion from training.)This line is the answer to really getting auditing done in an area.LRH:nt.rd  L.

This made it F/N on a rud.Thus the whole battery of tricks in the GF never get used on a pc.There is another assessment Method. Method 5. It is “once through marking thelength and BD of all reads”.One can then C/S “Assess GF once through”.Actually one usually says,“GF + 40 Method 5”.This means the auditor (usually on a case that is messy or just as a routine part of aProgress Program) just rat-a-tat-tat assesses the lot, marks the reads’ length and BDs.The C/S action that follows—the “Handle” consists of putting a red half swirlaround each that read and then doing the C/S for it.List outness is always handled first. Then ruds like ARC Brks, W/Hs and PTPs. Thenmore or less by the longest reads.It makes a long, long C/S in cases that are boggy.One uses engram running on it whenever he gets a chance as in “drugs”.Hidden standards are listed on a “Who/what would have______(the symptom)?”and “O/W on the item found”.A lot of old processes get a chance on these GF reads. It isn’t all “2-way common_______”.Foreign Language cases who do not have English as a native tongue and peoplewho don’t understand a lot have to have the GF items cleared. One takes the reads whileclearing the Question, of course.Designed as a Case Cracker, this new use of the Green Form restores it to a mightyweapon.Since I redeveloped ways to assess and began to really use this Green Form, I’veseen several very rough ridgy cases fall apart.So it is a very cheerful re-discovery.

The pc has a win.A long C/S also permits an auditor to adjust his own length of session.If the C/S isn’t complete on that day, one simply adds (1) “Fly a rud” and (2)“Continue C/S of (yesterday).”By having a whole Progress Program (repair) laid out on a red sheet and clippedwith its green Advance Pgm (grade chart) inside the front cover, over the sessionsummary, the guidance for the case is right there. This gets checked off as done.The C/S could consist of half the program or even (in shorter programs) all of it.HandlingOne speeds a line by taking repeated handlings out of it.Less sessions mean less handling.Thus the session is more economical if long.Getting the pc and folder rounded up 5 times when it means the same number ofhours to do it 2 times saves wear and tear.This is the benefit of very long C/Ses.Dianetic C/SesDianetic sessions often go 5 or even 8 hours.One tries to do all the flows of an item in one session.Length of PgmsWhen auditing the public, not staff, you long program.In a Progress (repair) Program you try to throw the whole bag of tricks at them.These are not only repairs, when you do a Progress Program. You throw in a lotof other bits like 2-way comms on BD items.87"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"You now have a Hi-Lo TA List to assess and an Expanded Green Form.Advance ProgramsAll Advance (gradesheet) Programs start lower than the pc was if the pc got introuble where he was.Often a grade is obviously out below where he is graded.Let us say he is a bogged “Grade IV”. Well, he couldn’t be a Grade IV. So theAdvance Program (green paper) that you do picks him up at Grade 0 or even Dianetics. A bogged “OT I” the other day began to win when(a) given a long long Progress Program, and(b) shoved back to Grade III on the Advance Program and brought on up all theway including OT I before going on to OT II!Thorough C/SesThus you can have long C/Ses only when you have long programs already doneand pinned to the inside of the front cover, a pink one for Progress (non grade) and agreen one for Advance (back up the grades).Don’t try to save auditing time. Save instead repeated handlings.This does not go into “over-repair”. A Progress Pgm contains all sorts of bits like2-wc on “What do you feel you owe your family” (as the pc is always getting off abouthis family in Ruds).The advance of a case is the amount of charge you get off it.Long C/Ses ease your Admin lines greatly.They also give less chance of having ruds go out between sessions.Short sessioning has its uses—small children, sick people, psychos.But long sessions save time in the long run and get the job done.

LIFE KNOCKING RUDS OUT FASTER THAN THEY CAN BE AUDITEDIN.Schedule sessions closer together and give very long sessions so life hasn’t achance to interfere. Can go as far as requiring person via the D of P to stay in a hotelaway from the area of enturbulation or not associate until case is audited up highenough.Shows up most drastically in Interiorization Intensives where no ruds can be rununless the RD is complete. Thus Int has to be done in one session, with the 2 wc Int-Ext the next day.2. PC PHYSICALLY ILL BEFORE NEXT SESSION AND AUDITING OF AMAJOR ACTION BEING DONE ON A SICK PC WHO SHOULD HAVEANOTHER C/S ENTIRELY.Happens when delayed or late new Exam reports don’t get into folder beforeC/Sing it. Ginger up Exam routing.Happens when auditors are not alert to the pc’s illness and audit anyway.

PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THEIR CASES.Past life reality is often badly hurt by people who talk about being Napoleon,Caesar and God. This makes “past lives” an unreal subject by bad comparison.Restimulative material is sometimes used to “push someone’s buttons”.Bullbait that uses actual processes or implants should be stamped out hard.9. ADVANCED COURSE MATERIAL INSECURITY.I have seen several cases wrecked by careless storage of Ad Course materialswhere lower levels could get at them.One notable case was a suppressive who got hold of Ad Course materials andchanted them at his wife to drive her insane. She recovered eventually. He didn’t.When a C/S gets a whiff of upper level materials on a lower level pc worksheet heshould make an ethics matter of it and get it traced.10. ILLEGAL DRUG USE.A pc who suddenly relapses onto drugs or who has a long drug history can causea case to look very very odd. The TA flies up. The case, running okay, suddenlyceases to run.Addicts can come off it if given TRs 0 to 9 and an HAS Course (modern).Drug chains are rehabbed and run out by Dianetics.  L.

The Folder Error Summary,the Folder session summary, the sessions, all have to be studied.The standard C/S action of going back to when the pc was running well andcoming forward for the error is very much in use.Such a case is the result of a FLUB always. Example: High TA case on Powerrun on and on with TA in the sky. A careful FES and study of folders revealed that 2years before, Power had been completed! Every current action was a brutal overrun!Yet the same C/S and ten separate auditors failed to see it! Indicating it and 2wc on theearlier Power handled the O/R. Example: Case RD not running well at all, TA goinghigh. A careful study of the folder session summary at length discovered that the pc hadnot F/Ned on 2 way comm Int-Ext. 2wc on this point discovered a total mess ofcommand clearing on the Int RD. This opened the door. Pc thereafter ran beautifully.Example: Pc a total nattery mess every session. Careful study found a tiny remark onthe white form about going to a psychiatrist. 2wc on it and the antagonism towardauditing and the withhold of having once gone crazy vanished. Case ran well.Careful study is the clue. The Auditor as a C/S may not put in the time needed toreally sort the case out.A current FES of recent auditing can also be ordered. This often reveals a lot ofoddball goofs which when handled make the case run well.The Org C/S is supposed to be the old master on solving these dog cases bycareful study.Heavy laurels to the auditor-as-a-C/S who spots the knot that is tangling the caseup.AUDITOR ERRORSThe errors of auditors can be so various one only looks to see if the actions of theauditor are standard when the Org C/S has to intervene.Then the outnesses show up.Example: Pc’s TA shooting up at session end. Examine the previous C/S. Callsfor L1B. Examine session. Auditor is found to be ITSAING ARC Breaks, no ARCUCDEI, no earlier similar.Action ordered, pick up the BD ARC Brk and do ARCU CDEI and carry it E/S toF/N.Action ordered. Auditor to Cramming to do Pattern of Bank, why earlier? andhow to fly ruds.Always find and handle auditor goofs by Cramming.

Where there’sno insistence they do not learn.HGC Auditors need a Cramming. They go stale. New HCO Bs aren’t understoodunless energetically checked out. The C/S in the Tech Div is at total risk where he is notbacked up by Cramming.The new HCO B 5 Mar 71, C/S Series 25, the new line, demands a Cramming asno auditor is likely to learn to C/S.You can’t risk fast flow with no Cramming to fall back on.And an org’s tech will never improve unless it has a Cramming for HGC auditorsand course students.Qual has to have a library of HCO Bs and course packs and books to really stayon the ball. Then its Cramming is hot, on the point, specializing mainly in finding whatthe auditor has neglected or misunderstood and getting it done.Cramming and use of it is the key to a fully satisfied field and an expanding org.The big plus points of the new HGC line are huge increases in delivery volume,very cocky never-blow auditors who get wins, an enthusiastic field, and last but notleast, newly trained and competent C/Ses who guard tech by knowing a correct C/S!The new line increases speed.At the same time it requires greater technical safeguards.The new HGC line won’t work unless you have a competent Qual Cramming andan Org C/S who knows his business and detects and pitchforks all flubs in auditing andC/Sing into the fast hands of a hot no-nonsense Cramming Officer.The new line of HCO B 5 Mar 71 is a great success.It greatly increases delivery quality as well as volume if this HCO B is stressed inputting the new line into action.

Get C/Sing Volume UP.4. Get C/Sing Quality UP.5. Get Programming Volume UP.6. Get Programming Quality UP.To do it in any other sequence is to organize before producing or to inhibit production.Auditing quality is raised by getting in Cramming and getting Cramming done.C/S quality is raised by C/S study of cases and the Qual Sec Cramming the C/S.Programming quality is raised by getting FESes done so that the action does not blockproduction and Cramming or Programming and then studying the case to make the Programming morereal and effective.MISPROGRAMMING1. Programming a case without data is risky. Dropping out the FES step, not getting White Formsdone, etc, short-cutting on data in general can cost tremendous amounts of lost auditing.2. Doing a vague general hopeful program of Repair (Progress) trusting something will come up isineffective. With data on the person’s life even on a pc never before audited, one can hit the keypoints even if only with 2-way comm on them. Cases that have been audited and are boggy areso for a reason. Programming without finding that reason can be very ineffective and result infew wins.3. Running a new major program into an incomplete major program can be as deadly as failing toflatten a process before starting another process only more so.4. Failing to end off a program when its End Phenomena is achieved is another gross error.5. Being too ignorant of the basic bank and the tech theory (as different than processes) is anotherbarrier to programming.6.

The shadowy remains of somatics blow, mass blows and the pc comes upshining.OFFERING FFDOffering the public Full Flow Dianetics must include the cost of FESing, FF tablemaking, and C/S work since it is sometimes lengthy. The auditing can be remarkablybrief. The greatest amount of time is usually spent on the C/Sing and the table making.FFD is offered to the public in intensives as per HCO B 31 May 1971R, C/SSeries 39R, “Standard 12 1/2 Hour Intensive Programs”. Admin time spent on C/Sing,FESing and FF table making should be deducted from the Intensive Hours purchasedby the pc. This must be made known to the public when purchasing the service.When offering FFD it should be called Quadruple Dianetics—4 times morepowerful than previous auditing.A C/S must liaise with the Dissem Sec and Treasury Sec on selling it or he’ll findthe org is losing money doing the C/Sing and tables.OT WARNINGWhen doing Quadruple Dianetics on Clears and OTs (and a very few others) itmay be found that many chains are now missing or are just copies of the original. Don’tbe disturbed. Pc says they’re gone now they’re gone. Just F/N the fact and carry onwith the next flow or item.L. RON HUBBARDFounderLRH:nt .rdCopyright © 1971, 1975by L.

IN EVERY EXAMINER NON F/N CASE IFOUND FLAGRANT OUT TECH IN (A) THE PROGRAMMING (B) THE C/SINGAND (C) THE AUDITING. All three outnesses existed.These cases were taken as all the Non F/N Exam reports on a line containinghundreds of folders and over 600 w.d. hours a week. So you can see that these errorshad been missed by expert C/Ses and Auditors. The errors were missed because HOPEwas being used instead of study.There was a hope that just routine C/Ses and auditing would work it outeventually.The fact of non F/N at Examiner was not given sufficient importance.The fact is that many who F/Ned at the Examiner had small flaws in them yet stillgot by.The Exam Non F/N indicates FLAGRANT OUT TECH in the Programming andthe C/Sing and the auditing. That’s what it takes.After a bug is found and corrected the case still may not F/N at the Examiner for awhile. But after that while is passed the failure to give the Examiner an F/N meansanother bug and more study.One case I found had had a major grade done twice two years apart. This waspointed out and rehabbed. But after 2 or 3 sessions the TA remained high. A restudynow found Recall Flow 2 of the Exteriorization Rundown had been run months ago toFIN and then continued for dozens of commands with the TA rising to 4.5. This wasthen repaired. The case then began to F/N at the Examiner. It now runs like an ordinarycase.There is always a bug, not necessarily current, often very old, in these Exam NonF/N Cases. There are sometimes two or three bugs.The answer is NOT go on C/Sing and hope.The answer IS, study and find the bug.Cases run on triples after a long list of singles is a type of bug.Cases exteriorizing and then getting no Ext RD is another bug.112"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"Cases given false reads or already run w/hs, cases who don’t tell their cogs, caseswho were on drugs but drugs were never run, cases that Rockslammed but no crimefound, any of the GF 40 or GF reading items, cases with lists out, cases that arealways sad or tired ..well these types of cases are the usual bugged cases. But eventhey sometimes F/N if only to roller coaster.The general rule of going back to where the case was running well and comingforward still holds. But an audit past Exteriorization can be before that and onlyeventually catch up.General repair is harmful when a big bug exists.Every case I examined had a big bug.

Inches of folder later theinterrupted program was found and resumed and the case did great. All that “hopeful”repair was lost work. Ten minutes of case study would have saved twenty hours ofuseless repair.The stable datum is CASES MODERATELY WELL PROGRAMMED, C/SEDAND AUDITED RUN WELL.So cases that don’t run well (unchanging Exam natter comment, Non F/N) have aBIG error in Programming, C/Sing and Auditing.Look well and you will find it.

Most arevery ordinary, even corny.IT IS VITAL TO CORRECT AN INT RD ERROR AS A FIRST ACTION.There is one Int RD error that is not a purely Dianetic error and that is the errordoing anything else at all before an Int RD is done properly or an Int RD error is fullycorrected.The Int RD error may be simply that “Went In” and “Go In” did not read on themeter yet Int was run. This classifies as “running an unreading item”.Or the Int RD could have been overrun. It goes flat on Secondary F2, let us say.The Auditor keeps on going past the win. This will hang up the Rundown. One of theways an overrun occurs is the pc goes exterior during it. Yet the Auditor keeps on.Another way is pc has a big cog, big win. Auditor keeps going on with the RD.When a pc is exteriorized by auditing and is then audited further without beinggiven an Interiorization Rundown, his TA will go high or low and he may be veryupset. Heavy masses may come in and he may also get ill.Int RD errors also may go back to earlier Dianetic errors. A number of unflatincidents invite the overrun of these if they also occur on a Dianetic chain.To clean up a balled-up Int RD chain or incident one may have to find and cleanup the Dianetic error it is sitting on during the clean-up of the Int RD error.Int RD errors, goofs, etc, are handled by using an Int RD Correction ListRevised, HCO B 29 Oct 71R.Auditors who can’t run ordinary R3R with great success should not be let near anInteriorization RD as their lack of smoothness in handling Dianetics will wreck the IntRD.CLASS IV, HDC AUDITORSAn excellent Class IV HDC Auditor can easily repair a messed-up InteriorizationRundown after a folder study and by use of an Int RD Correction List Revised, HCO B29 Oct 71R.A Class IV HDC Auditor with an excellent Dianetic Record of wins can be givenan Int RD to do or to correct IF HE IS STARRATED ON THE INT PACK AND THETWO-WAY COMM PACK.115"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"REPAIRWherever you see a TA high and a pc in trouble your first suspicions should be:1. Audited past Ext in Auditing without an Int RD being done.2. Int RD botched by being unnecessary (“went in” didn’t read) or overrun orAuditor goofs in the session.3. A previously messed-up Dianetic action has gotten fouled up with the Int RD.4. The Int Command was improperly cleared (such as “means go in and out again”“means trapped” “meant leaving” etc).5. Firefights and worries over the high or low TA have ensued after an Int ball-uphas occurred.6. Some major action like grades or items of Power have been run twice.7. A C/S has hopefully kept on getting the pc audited without detecting the realreason as a flubbed Int RD.PERCENTAGESThe percent of misrun Int RDs is high, many being unnecessary or overrun.The liability of leaving them unrepaired is high.Reasons for high TA are averaging out close to 100% as an unrun or a flubbedand unrepaired Int RD.EXT IN SESSIONWhen a pc Exteriorizes in session it is the End Phenomena for that process oraction. One gently ends off in any case. Then if after the fact of going exterior inauditing, a pc’s TA goes high, then you do the Int RD. You test Int for a read (test“went in” and “go in” per HCO B 24 Sept 71, “Interiorization Rundown”) and if itreads you do an Int RD.You just don’t do one because a pc goes exterior.Maybe it wasn’t needed. So if it wasn’t needed it will eventually have to berepaired.If even years after an Int RD the pc has a high TA or a low TA then Int trouble isat once suspected and the original Int RD and any repair of it is suspect and must behandled.The Int RD Correction List Revised, HCO B 29 Oct 71R, has been designed tostraighten out Int RDs. L3RD handles the Dianetic errors. Where Int RD CorrectionLists have been done and the pc still has headaches, the C/S handles with AESPs (listedseparately) that would make him interiorize.There is no real trick to either running a correct Int RD or repairing a flubbed one.The whole clue is whether or not the Auditor can audit plain ordinary gardenvariety R3R.So when ANY Auditor audits a pc past Exterior and the pc’s TA goes high heshould be checked out fully on the Int RD Checksheet so he won’t continue to committhe error.116"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"And when ANYONE is going to run an Int RD he must:A. Be an expert Dianetic Auditor and Class IV.B. Be Starrated on all the Int RD Pack.And when any C/S is confronted with high TAs or low TAs and doesn’t handle atonce by getting an Int RD properly run or properly repaired he must be rechecked onthe Dianetics Pack and the Int RD Pack.DN C/S 1A very careful Dianetic C/S 1 must be done on a previously unindoctrinated pcbefore he is run on an Int RD.Otherwise it’s all too new.A C/S 1 isn’t auditing.The pc who can’t do what the Auditor says or can’t correct an erroneous action islost.A fully safe pc would be one who when he goes Ext in Auditing is made to do anHDC at once before he even gets any ruds put in and not audited again until he is anHDC. He’d be a pc who was relatively safe.A pc who does what an inexpert Auditor says without question can really getfouled up ! Uneducated pcs require really flawless topnotch Auditors. The Auditor whocan audit an uneducated pc is a jewel. He really has to know his business. Because thepc does whatever he says. And if he says wrongly, then there goes the session. Evernotice pc corrections in a worksheet? “I think you by-passed an F/N.” “This feelsoverrun.” “I had Grade I last year.” Such Auditors are not fully enough trained tohandle wholly green pcs!SIMPLICITYHonest fellows, it’s as easy to run an Int RD as it is to run “an ear pain”.It isn’t even mysterious or tough.IT IS ONLY VERY IMPORTANT TO DETECT WHEN IT NEEDS TO BEDONE OR REPAIRED.There are no mysteries.Some Auditors have got me feeling like I’m trying to teach them to chew softbread!

This can be so corruptedthat the auditor doesn’t ack at all but gives the pc meter reads! Instead of acks! Or keepssaying, “I didn’t understand you,” etc.TR Three basically existed so that the auditor would continue to give the pccommands and not squirrel off or pack up with total silence.TR Four exists so that the pc’s origins are accepted and not Qed and Aed with orinvalidated.And, surprise, surprise, TRs are for use in the session itself, not just a drill. They arehow one runs a session.Metering can miss every F/N or give “F/Ns” with high or low TA. And one neverfeeds meter data to the pc: “That read,” “That didn’t read,” “That blew down,” justmust not exist in session patter. “Thank you. That F/Ned,” is as far as an auditor goes.And that’s the end of the cycle and says so.Floating needles can be overlooked by an auditor. In Dianetics this fault is fatal.Auditor’s Code must be in on all points and particularly Invalidation. Pc says,“That’s so and so.” An auditor who says, “I’m sorry. You are wrong,” or any otherinvalidation is going to wreck a pc’s case. A full knowledge of the Auditor’s Code andactually applying it saves endless troubles. It is an auditing TOOL, not just a nice idea.REHABBING CHAINSOne rehabs a Dianetic Chain that, according to a previous worksheet, erased bysaying, “According to session records (flow direction) (item) erased.” That’s all. Onedoes not say, “Did the chain giving others a headache erase?” One does not run it againto find out. One does not run a single command “to see if it F/Ns again”. One can say,“Do you agree that the chain giving another a headache erased?” But the more you askthe pc to118"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"look for an erased chain the more messed up things will get. It isn’t there. But the auditorby his action can imply it should be there or might be there.

If you try to useScientology rehab tech on a Dianetic Chain, you have had it. It isn’t a “release” (whichis a key-out). A Dianetic Chain is an erasure.

Orkeeps saying, “I didn’t understand you,” etc.TR Three basically existed so that the Auditor would continue to give the pccommands and not squirrel off or pack up with total silence.TR Four exists so that the pc’s origins are accepted and not Qed and Aed with orinvalidated.122"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"And, surprise, surprise, TRs are for use in the session itself, not just a drill.

That F/Ned,” is as far as an Auditor goes.And that’s the end of the cycle and says so.Floating needles can be overlooked by an Auditor. In Quad Dianetics this fault isfatal.Auditor’s Code must be in on all points and particularly Invalidation. Pc says,“That’s so and so.” An Auditor who says, “I’m sorry. You are wrong,” or any otherinvalidation is going to wreck a pc’s case. A full knowledge of the Auditor’s Code andactually applying it saves endless troubles. It is an auditing TOOL, not just a nice idea.REHABBING CHAINSOne rehabs a Dianetic Chain that, according to a previous worksheet, erased bysaying, “According to session records (flow direction) (item) erased.” That’s all. Onedoes not say, “Did the chain giving others a headache erase?” One does not run it againto find out. One does not run a single command “to see if it F/Ns again”. One can say,“Do you agree that the chain giving another a headache erased?” But the more you ask apc to look for an erased chain the more messed up things will get. It isn’t there. But theAuditor by his action can imply it should be there or might be there. A totally wrongapproach would be, “Look around your bank and see if what isn’t there anymore isn’tthere.”Dianetics is NOT Scientology. A Dianetic Chain is not a release.

They are replaced by thisHCOB, C/S Series 37R.)MUST BE CHECKED OUT *RATEAND IN CLAY BEFORE USE!HIGH AND LOW TA BREAKTHROUGHHigh and Low TAs have been a longtime puzzle and stumbling block to Auditors.The usual definition of OVERRUN is “gone on too long” or “happened toooften”. This causes high TAs to occur.In examining a few failures on using “overrun”, I have found that underlying thisthere is a more basic principle.When a thetan believes something is “overrun” or “has gone on too long” or “wasdone too often” he is expressing only a symptom of another mechanism.The truth is A THETAN CAN DO ANYTHING FOREVER.To Audit “overruns” is auditing toward an untruth. Thus if carried on as a processit is really an out of ARC Process.That which makes a thetan believe something can be overrun is the EFFORT TOSTOP or THE EFFORT TO STOP HIM.The effort to stop something, when generalized, becomes a “stop everything” andIS the entrance point of insanity. This has been known since 1967. But I did not earlierconnect it with the OVERRUN phenomenon.When a thetan has a long chain of efforts to stop or a chain of efforts to stop him(mixed up with protest, of course, and shame, blame and regret and other humanemotion and reaction) he accumulates ridges. These make mass.This mass makes the high TA.In truth it is not possible to kill a thetan, so therefore any effort to stop a thetanwould only have partial success. So the chain is also full of INCOMPLETES.An incomplete cycle of action causes ARC Breaks.Thus an OVERRUN is full of MASS and ARC Breaks!As you possibly recall from the material of about 1955 the one process you mustnot run on a pc is “Look out of here and find something you can go out of ARC with.”This sends him into a dwindling spiral.127"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The common denominators of a bank are OUT OF ARC and STOP!Thus if too long a list of “What has been Overrun” is required to obtain the firstBD F/N item the listing action may very well restimulate much more bank than caneasily be handled on some pcs.As these are also the pcs with very high TA, if one lists for overrun and runsmuch too long a list to get his first BD F/N item, the pc can be heavily restimulated.Listing errors or upsets can make this, then, too uncomfortable a proceeding for apc and should NOT now be done.And if it doesn’t work on some pcs in the hands of some auditors, it musttherefore be cancelled. Any recommendation on VIII Course to do it is cancelled.The theory is correct as given on the VIII Course. There, a few items wereintended. But now some very long lists have come up on some pcs which made the pcuncomfortable and were hard for the auditor to handle. Thus the BD F/N item overrunlist must not be done.CONTINUE is then the Reverse Action to overrun. Continue equals Survival.The REVERSE to overrun therefore can be run as a process, to wit, “What wouldyou be permitted to continue?” or “What could be Continued?”This however would not be very successful. Thus the listing action isrecommended as the process to use.LISTSSEVEN Lists can be done on Overrun itself by using the in-ARC Approach.AssessA. Self to another B. Another to self C. Others to others D. Others to self E. Self to self F. Another to others G. Others to anotherOrdinarily the biggest read or any read has located a flow that will run and will bemost real to the pc. But this is not true in handling overruns. The most stopped orrising read is where he’s really hung. To get a TA down list the most stopped read orthe rise of the read or the item that raised the TA when called. This is ONLY true ofOverruns.The list questions for the above are:If A stopped: “What could you continue to do to another?”If B stopped: “What could another continue to do to you?”If C stopped: “What could others continue to do to others?”If D stopped: “What could others continue to do to you?”128"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"If E stopped: “What could you continue to do to yourself?”If F stopped, list “What could another continue to do to others?”If G stopped, list “What could others continue to do to another?”The “Most stopped read” would be one that really froze the needle or caused it torise or caused the TA to RISE such as 3.5 to 3.6.The lists would be listed to a BD F/N item, Cog, VGIs. Actually the list could belisted forever. But the pc will get an item he likes and that F/Ns. He is then given hisitem. One does NOT null such lists unless one has really goofed.ALL the lists A, B, C, D, E, F and G can be listed. To get a TA DOWN you listthe flow that sends the TA UP. Then reassess for the next that sends the TA up, etc.LOW TAThe same exact thing causes LOW TAs. The flow could be said to haveoverwhelmed the pc.Exactly how you read the list for Low TA will be given in another HCOB afterfurther tests are made. In theory it would go lower on assessment.Please note that OUT TRs on the part of auditors is the most frequent cause oflow TAs. TR 1 that drives the pc out through the back of his head can cause a low(below 2.0) TA on a lot of pcs.END PHENOMENAThe End Phenomena, the “EP” of a TA HANDLING RUNDOWN would be alllists assessed or listed to F/N and the pc’s needle doing a persistent continual F/N fordays. This means an F/N, wide, that nothing can kill.DEPT 10The Department of Special Cases should have auditors who can do this rundownby the book and with perfect results. It is really a Dept 10 technique.FLOWS NOTEThere are about seven flow directions that can be used or listed. (1) Self toanother, (2) Another to self, (3) Others to others, (4) Self to others, (5) Others to self,(6) Another to others, (7) Others to another.“Flow” is an electronic flow in a direction. In Phoenix, Arizona, in 1952 an“Oscilloscope” (has a face like a radar, shows wave patterns and directions) was oncehooked up to an E-Meter movement and showed that a mental flow will flow just solong in one direction. By reversing the repetitive commands when the left-rightdirectional flow slowed, the flow turned around and flowed right-left then slowed, etc.So actual electrical flow occurs in response to the directional command (like “self toanother”). Also it jams up when run too long on an average human because his mindhas “overruns” in it already.“Ridges” and masses come about from a conflict of flows opposing or beingpulled back as in withholds.High TAs are caused by two or more flows opposing thus making a mass orridge.Low TAs are caused by overwhelm by flows.129"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"The thetan thinks of them as overruns and so quits on a subject or wishes hecould.This is why the TA behaves as it does on life and certain subjects.There is no real reason why a flow can’t go on forever in one direction unless athetan tries to stop it. Then it ridges and makes mass which then reads on a TA.AUDITOR QUALIFICATIONSAn Auditor must be a master at Listing and Nulling in order to touch such Actionsas these lists. To foul up on listing on an already fouled-up pc is quite out-tech !An auditor’s TRs should have been passed the Hard Way.His metering must be excellent and flawless.His command and use of the Auditor’s Code must be complete.He should himself have had case gain.He must have a full checkout on this HCO B and be able to do it in clay.And as I say, he must know the subject of Listing and Nulling so well, he canalways list smoothly to a BD F/N item with never a quiver.INTERIORIZATION RUNDOWNThis HCO B does not change the Interiorization Rundown in theory or inpractice.It does however give this procedure.1. On a high or low TA pc check for Exteriorization in auditing.2. If pc has gone Ext in Auditing make sure he has not had an Ext-Int RD earlierbefore giving him another.3. If an earlier Int RD exists repair, complete or rehab it. Often an Int RD is itselfoverrun. An L3B on it will show what is wrong with the earlier one. Some poorHigh TA pcs have had 2 or 3 Ext-Int RDs! All run past the EP.Some Ext-Int RDs went totally flat on the secondaries! Or on the recalls. All elsewas overrun.4. If no earlier Ext-Int RD was done, then do one.5. If the check of the Ext-Int RD situation shows it not to be the reason, or was thereason but the TA goes high or low days later, then DO THIS TA HANDLINGRD.As pc high and low TAs have been blocking auditing for a lot of auditors thisdiscovery and its remedy is Delightful news!LRH:nt.rdL.

One just keeps this up.Eventually on assessing the seven flows you can only get a stopped needle. Then aslowed or killed F/N. One uses these for lists. Sometimes toward the last they blow onindication and cog.The end of it all is the auditor assessing the seven flows without being able todisturb a wide wide persistent F/N.THAT is the EP of the 37R process. There is no other EP. If not done to that EP the37R process is incomplete.CLEARING FLOWSThe idea of flows should be cleared with the pc before assessment is done.One can do this by getting the pc to draw them.Don’t confuse the pc with this clearing and make sure he is not confused beforeassessing the seven flows.REPEATED ASSMTOne can take a sheet of paper lengthwise and write the seven flows along the leftedge with lines to the right. By putting in dividing vertical lines one then has 10 or 12assessments laid out ready to do.LOW TAUnless one does a THOROUGH JOB to the 37R End Phenomena on a low TA casethe TA will continue to go low in future sessions.A low TA takes more times through the assessments and listing than a high TA.CRAMMINGAuditors who can’t do this well must be fully crammed on reading a needle and TAon stops, rises and blow ups.The result, if properly done, is invariably good.LRH:nt.rdL.

He can also fail to put it back on the list and if so and he is getting restlessin listing, give him the BD F/N item again and he’ll buy it.A very big item that alters the pc’s whole concept of things with big cogs and 2wc is a good place to stop a session. 37R doesn’t all have to be done in one session.When you begin a new list before the last item is discharged the pc can get a bitoverwhelmed. This is a “nice” point, not a vital one.Also the big item will often cause the next assessment to be a bit hard as the pc’sattention remains tied up in it for a while.If after 37R the pc’s TA later goes up or down again out of normal 2.0 to 3.0range the action to do is an L4B in general on 37R. It usually picks up the cognitionsand confirms rather than corrects. L4B reads on wrong item. Auditor says which one.Pc gives it. Quite usually it’s a right item pc hasn’t cogged on.After the L4B, one can again run 37R. However, a better action is toFly all ruds Continue with L9S.RUDSWhen Ruds are out during 37R a pc can feel strange. Of course with a high orlow TA you can’t get the ruds in.So you can do a list of 37R and as this will F/N the meter, you can get in all ruds.FLOWSThe pc may have NO idea of flows. So before assessing the first time one mustclear “flows”. The pc must understand that these words self to another mean a flowfrom himself to any another, etc.If while clearing the word “flow” and “flows” you watch your meter also you willget your first blow up of the TA.133"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"ASSESS SLOWLYBy reading a flow and waiting a moment, you give the TA time to rise.You can assess too rapidly and find that the TA has gone up, but which of the lastitems did it go up on?

ANOTHER TO ANOTHER.This should be added to your assessment sheet.ASSESSMENT FORMAn assessment form can be printed.

Enter a new major action into a case already in progress on anotherincomplete major action.I have seen a case on as many as five major actions with none complete. Andwhen I see this the first thing I take up is the first unflat incomplete program and get itfinished, then the next, then the next. The case comes out all smooth.Example: Case is on but not complete on Dianetic auditing. Switched to grades.Incomplete on grades, gets a Prog Pgm. Incomplete on a Prog Pgm, shifted to Power.The only apparent exception is a repair. A case can be repaired if boggedPROVIDING THE ORIGINAL ACTION IS REHABBED IF O/R OR COMPLETEDTO EP.A Progress Pgm may reach EP before the written up program is completed.Thus a Process Completion is defined as the END PHENOMENA of the process.A Program is complete when the END PHENOMENA of the Program is attained.TRsAny course or program containing TRs 0-4, 6-9 or Admin TRs is a majorprogram in itself. It produces case gain—if run right—and has an End Phenomenon.Further, by actual experience when a person is on a real (not a patty-cake andweak) TR Course and is also being audited at the same time, the C/S and Auditor ifthey don’t know the person is also on TRs can be utterly baffled and worried as thecase does not run right. “What did I do?” “What C/S was wrong?” “Look, his TA ishigh.” “Now it’s low.” “Last session he____.” And the C/S and auditor engage inefforts to handle the odd case behavior. But the person, unknown to them, was also ona real TR Course and his case was changing!INTERJECTED PGMSYou can also run into this same oddity with a mystic who does “bathe the body inlight” every night or a wife whose husband audits her between HGC sessions or a self-auditor.The principle is the same. The C/S and auditor are going down Wellbeing Streetand hidden trucks keep dashing out of alleys and running into the pc.LIFEThe reason auditing should be done in intensive packages, not l hour a week or asession a month lies in the fact that LIFE can run a new action in on a pc.It’s a great way to waste auditing to let a pc have a session once a week. Youcan’t even keep his ruds in if he lives in any confusions.So nothing is done for the case, all the auditing goes to handle the lifeinterjections!CROSS PROGRAMMINGA case runs on cycles of actions. This is true in the auditing comm cycle. It is truein a process cycle. It is true in a program cycle.137"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"New things being crossed into old incomplete things make a sort of ARC Breaksituation like a cut comm cycle.One could do everything with a process or a program OR A COURSE that youfind on an L1C. It would not be very wise.No case gain can be created by lack of a comm cycle in an auditor, lack of anaction cycle in processes or messing up a program cycle.If you don’t believe it, run an L1C on a pc with “Processes” and “Programs” and“Courses” as a prefix. You’d be amazed. Further the fellow who doesn’t reach the EPof a Course is likely never to use that material or be faulty with the subject.Usual study courses like admin or tech give case gain. One can carry on withauditing parallel to them. But still expect a case to change a bit by study and baffle aC/S once in a while. But a real TR Course produces changes up and down and up thatare not possible to also audit around.

All the hard work of C/Sing comes in when auditors areflubby.It takes weeks to make an auditor after he has had a course and it’s only done byCram-Cram—Cram.R FACTORSNever order an R Factor that takes pc into future or past as he then won’t be insession. Example: C/Ses “R Factor we are setting you up for Dianetics.” Promptly thepc is up ahead not in this session.142"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"MIXING STARTSThere are many ways to start a session. Don’t mix them.It’s “2 wc what do you have your attention on?”“Fly a rud if no F/N.” “Fly all ruds.” “2 wc the TA down.”“Fly a rud or GF + 40 Method 5 and handle.”It’s not a mixture of frantic efforts to get a TA down.If the auditor can’t on what the C/S says THE AUDITOR ENDS OFF.Interiorization is undone or out, there may be list errors, there may be overruns,but for sure it’s a case for FOLDER STUDY, not for an auditor C/Sing in the chair.HIGH TA & ARC BRKSTrain your auditors NEVER TRY TO GET A TA DOWN FROM 3.5 OR ABOVEON ARC BREAKS.LOW TA QUITSSome auditors see a TA sink below 2.0 and then won’t continue the 2 wc orprocess to get the TA back up.“The TA sank so I quit” is a common auditor note.Compare this: “The TA rose above 3.0 so I quit.”See? Doesn’t make sense.If a TA sinks below 2.0—and the auditor’s TRs are good—the same action willusually bring it up to 2.0 and F/N.Come down hard on auditors who do this.Get their TRs checked, make them continue.EXAM F/Ns AFTER FLUBSPcs whose TAs are high in session or low in session and get F/N at the Examsput the finger on the auditor. They are protesting or being overwhelmed.Always C/S “Examiner! Ask pc what auditor did in session.”Then you know it’s the auditor or the case. The pc will say the auditor was okay.So it’s case. But usually when cases are puzzles there’s weird things going on withTRs.Also the auditor may be noisy or laugh hard or is boisterous and being“interesting”.C/S VIAThe C/S is handling cases on the via of an auditor.143"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"If the auditor is perfect the C/S can handle the work out of the case. If the auditoris not perfect in TRs, metering, Code, reports and doing the C/S then the C/S is solvinga factor unknown to him, not the pc’s case.So, be a perfect C/S. Demand perfect auditing. Cases fly.HIGHER LEVELSA C/S who assesses a pc to higher levels to solve lower ones is really asking for awreck.It’s always the earlier actions that are out.Trying to cheat a case up to Grade 2 when he won’t run on Grade I is like tryingto run the whole grade chart to cure a cold.A pc can always be solved in or below where he is.“Oh, we’ll put him up a grade and cure his high TA” is like “He can’t passkindergarten so we’ll enroll him in college.”C/S EXPERTISEA C/S has to know his auditing materials, HCO Bs and texts MUCH better thanan auditor.If a C/S is not being successful, get a retread on VI and VIII materials.A C/S also must be confident HE could crack the case as an auditor.When a C/S is shaky on his materials then the world of auditing looks veryunstable.The tech is very exact, very effective. If any errors existed in it they’ve beencorrected.So the variables are the knowledge of the C/S, his discipline and demands ofauditors and the actions of the auditor.If THESE are stable then the cases that come along are easy as can be.The successful C/S knows his materials. If he wants to be even more successfulhe keeps his study up.Then he is steady and calm for he is totally certain.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:sb.rdCopyright © 1971by L.

Don’t disperse and do something new.If you have a program going and it’s goofed, repair the auditor and the goofed pcand continue the program you began on the case.Repair (Progress) Programs are ended when the pc is flying nicely. When a repairhits that, don’t re-repair.On Advance Programs, take each step to its EP. Don’t suddenly start somethingnew.A sure way to solve a case is go back and find the earliest incomplete program,complete it and so on up to PT.Keep your “finger in the book” on a case. Don’t lose your place. That’s done byhaving the current pgm on the inside front cover, paper clipped on, and checked offwith each step done. When it’s done, put a new pgm on top of it.Insist that auditors keep up the inside front cover folder summary each sessionwith their auditing time and admin time in the box. This FS is a 2 column set of boxes,date, what’s run, F/N or bogged and time.By seeing Admin is in you can keep your place in the book or study back rapidlyto find what’s been done.DOUBLE ACTIONSThe deadliest faults on cases are running the same action or grade twice. Thisdrives TAs up through the roof.Example: Power done in ‘65. Done again in ‘69!Example: Grade IV done in ‘69, done in ‘70.You find the case isn’t doing well or find the error. In doubles, rehab by date ofthe first time it was done.I’ve seen Interiorization done three times on one pc, Power twice and the sameDianetic Chains run over and over. And people wondered “Why is the TA high” !So when you order a major action always check to see if it’s ever been donebefore! Save you grief. And if a major action won’t run, suspect it may have been donebefore.145"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"SET-UPSAlways set up a case fully for the next major action.Don’t overrepair.

Many it is true are dog cases.But even dog cases can be handled.When you find auditors (or feel yourself) blaming the pc, get the overts andwithholds run out.Once I got the most splendid sessions out of an HGC. I had the auditor’s overtsand withholds checked on each auditor before he went into session. It was justresearch, but my it worked! Those were the smoothest sessions! Pcs began to fly!Too many times one blames the pc only to find later that the auditor’s TRs wereghastly and that a major action had been run twice. Such discoveries make a C/S out ofa C/S.L.

The C/S can spot a possible error but the pcis Wide F/N VGIs at the Exam, let it go.Chew the auditor, send to Cramming. But don’t throw the well running pc intoextensive repair—don’t break into a winning program harshly. It gives the pc a loss.The pc who isn’t running well is the one you repair. Don’t keep a pc going onand on, running badly with no case study. Study the case folder, find the right why bygoing back to where the pc was running consistently well and then come forward forthe error. It will be in the exact next session.If the pc wasn’t ever audited before, you go into his life of course, with a GF +40 Method 5 and handle and other Life repairs.OVERREPAIRAny Repair or Progress action has reached its End Phenomena when the pc isrunning well again.This is peculiar to the Repair or Progress program.Wrong Example: Pc was on Grade III, fell on his head. C/S studied case, foundout lists, wrote an extensive Repair Pgm and C/S. Half way through repair the pc againwas flying. C/S continued the repair. Pc bogged. C/S C/Sed the pc to flying again. C/Scontinued the repair. Pc bogged.Right Example: Pc falls on his head on Grade III. C/S writes a Repair Pgm andC/S. Auditor finds the out list, corrects it. Pc flies. C/S puts pc at once back on GradeIII to complete.AUDITOR INVALAn auditor can be invalidated by a C/S by having a lot of questionable tech pointsthrown at him.The auditor’s data gets shaky.If no decision was ever made—is not in HCO Bs and tapes—is not to hand andcan’t be referred to by HCO B and tape, then a C/S should not be making the point.Example: Auditor extends a list three more items beyond an F/N. C/S chops him.There is no such rule. The pc maybe wouldn’t accept the item until he listed a fewmore. Result is a firefight between C/S and auditor, simply because it isn’t a validpoint.147"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"HCO Bs and Tapes are the stable data that form the agreement between the auditorand the C/S. “If it isn’t written (or spoken on tape) it isn’t true.”Don’t wander off known tech points in C/Sing.Never shake an auditor’s data by advancing data not on HCO Bs and Tapes.Always know your data, your HCO Bs and Tapes and refer the auditor to them inCramming.Cramming MUST have a library of all materials.A hidden data line can build up in C/S-Auditor lines (or course lines or Cramminglines) that CAN UNSTABILIZE ALL TECH AND DENY FURTHER RESULTS.The decay of tech in areas begins with hidden data lines that ARE NOT TRUE.So use and refer to HCO Bs and Tapes and leave all other points alone. Yourauditors will become confident and certain and Tech will improve.It’s enough just to insist on the usual.Then auditors and cases will fly.L. RON HUBBARDFounderLRH:sb.rdCopyright © 1971by L.

The additional No. 40 items are the originalSeven Resistive Cases. The best way to do a GF + 40 is Method 5 (once through),lengths of reads and BDs marked and C/S to then write a C/S for it.Hi-Lo TA is also such a list, also done Method 5.Any such prepared list can be done Method 5 and the C/S to then write a C/S.But L4B (Lists correction), L3B (Dianetic errors) and L1C (ARC Brks andbypassed charge) are usually done Method 3 (auditor assesses to a read, gets the actiondone, and/or earlier similar to an F/N, not going on until his action has resulted in anF/N and then going on to complete handling and F/Ning each read he gets).When the C/S has a list assessed Method 5 he expects usually to get it back withthe reads and then write the C/S for it. Sometimes he asks for a GF + 40 and a Hi-LoTA both to be done Method 5.Now the question comes up, which reads does the C/S write up to be handledfirst? And second? And third? Etc. In other words how does he arrange the C/S theauditor is to do now? What sequence are the items handled in?These rules apply:Handle an Out Int RD first.Handle anything connected with “Lists” (meaning Listing and Nulling Lists) firstif Int isn’t out. Like “Listed past right item,” reads. The C/S would get that handledFIRST. Always handle list errors first. And usually do an L4B additionally, Auditor tohandle. A pc can get sick after a listing error and you can’t get auditing done when listsare out.Doesn’t want auditing, why, is then handled if it read.Next C/S to handle anything to do with rudiments. ARC Brks, PTPs and W/Hstake precedence in that order.(Listing errors are first, before ARC Brks because an apparent ARC Break after alisting error can only be handled by getting the charge off the list.)Anything that looks like a withhold comes next.After that one just takes the lengths or BD of reads. Take the biggest reads beforeyou take the smaller ones, once you have C/Sed for Lists, doesn’t want auditing andRuds and evident other withholds.149"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"The only confusion that one can get into is a very high TA. But List errors cancause high TAs. Next in frequency is withholds.Never C/S to take a TA down with an ARC Brk rud or an L1C. Never.You can C/S to “talk a TA down” only when there are no list errors or withholdsreading on a GF.Of course an Interiorization Rundown error is a primary target. But you don’thave that once it’s handled. You will get a soaring TA if Int is out. L3B is a potent toolto order for Int outnesses, the auditor handling as he goes, Method 3.-------------So the above gives you the rules by which you C/S from assessed prepared lists.Basically—when Int is out, auditing will drive the TA up.When lists are out nothing will handle but lists and L1C won’t nor will ruds.When ruds are out nothing else will straighten up and you mustn’t order auditorsto audit with out ruds.Doesn’t want auditing can come from a bad L & N list. Or out Int. Or out ruds.Previous bad auditing can be cured by L1C on previous bad auditing. The craziest outauditing I ever ran into was an auditor using reads and F/Ns when there were none andfailing to take up or flatten reads he did get. So there can be variations on bad auditingand there can be, to our shame, false auditing reports. The best C/S is to find whatauditor and find out what the error was. Bad TRs on a poor TR Course where the pcwas a student (False passes and invalidated wins) can also cause “doesn’t wantauditing”.“Protest” is a frequent reason for high TA and is a cousin to “doesn’t wantauditing” and is handled by checking “Lists” for read and doing an L4B if it reads orfinding the out ruds or other BPC as in L1 C.-------------As there are so many combinations of reading items from prepared lists, you haveto C/S according to these general principles.These rules serve as a steadying guide that you’ll find win for you.LRH:sb.rdL.

The various prepared lists are used to get all the data on what needs handling on a ProgressProgram.Any other reason for resistiveness as a case.These things above are the things that prevent or slow case gain. Just handling them correctlyand fully gives the case terrific wins. Failure to handle them sets the Pc, the C/S, and the Auditor upfor losses.Once the Pc’s case is fully repaired with the Progress Program he is then set up for excellentgains and will be very auditable. He is now put onto the Advance Program which completes anyincomplete Grade cycles and fills in any missing ones as it takes him up the Grade Chart. (See C/SSeries 39R, 31 May 71 Revised 21 Oct 71.)Processes should not be extracted from the Expanded Grades and other standard programs, for usein Progress Programs (Repair) or “Special Programs” but should be taken from other sources, so as notto break up the standard program for later use on the case.

It is a technical point.Every so often a pc is found hung up in not having declared and attested the stateattained.A Declare Completes his cycle of action and is a vital part of the action.One never forces or feeds one to the pc. I recall one org where the entire tech andincome structure crashed, the C/O and several personnel had to be removed becausethey were forcing “clear cogs” on their Dianetic pcs who hadn’t had them (and thentelling them they couldn’t be audited further on Scientology) (Connie Broadbent,ASHO, March ‘70).So this goes 2 ways.THE PC OR PRE OT WHO KNOWS HE MADE IT MUST BE SENT TOEXAMS AND C & A TO ATTEST.THE PC OR PRE OT WHO HASN’T MADE IT MUST NEVER BE SENT TOEXAMS TO DECLARE AND ATTEST.This gives us a third:PCs AND PRE OTs WHO HAVEN’T MADE IT MUST BE HANDLED UNTILTHEY HAVE MADE THAT SPECIFIC DECLARE, EVEN THOUGH IT MEANSSIGNING UP FOR MORE AUDITING.TRUTH is the keynote, the essence, the point here.All the “PR” (slang for promotional talk) in the world will not supplant truth.The pc KNOWS he made something. Therefore he must be sent to declare itwhether it’s a standard grade or not!The pc who hasn’t made it KNOWS he hasn’t and so when forced to declare orordered to attest tends to cave in.His concept of the validity of the org and honesty of Scientology depends on this,and really on this alone.The correct declare or not declare decision of the C/S is a vital C/S action.LRH:nt rdL.

Not Dn, Cl VI, Class VIII, Dn, Class VI.One C/Ses or audits a Rundown as itself, not as a botch of several actions runinto it.So this brings to view that some can run the process or program for A to B.And some, worse luck,(a) Go from A to G to Q to A and wonder why they don’t arrive at the B ofresult.(b) Some go from A to B all right but when at B go right on past it.Both, actually, are a type of non-confront. The A.G.Q.A can’t confront anddisperses off arriving at B. The A beyond B hasn’t confronted B and so doesn’trecognize B.The ability to confront the pc and the session and parts of the session permits oneto accurately go from A to B.Proving this, perception reduces in ratio to overts. Accept that fact as it’s true. Ifyou run O/W on an auditor regarding the pc he is to audit, the auditor will give a perfectsession to that pc. Why? He can confront because he can see.Programming is simply an A to B action. The road is all laid out.Auditing a process is a simple A to B Action.What if you had an auditor who half way through Level Zero with no completionfound a picture, did Dianetics on it, didn’t flatten the R3R because pc cogged it was likehis mother and the auditor did O/W on mother in the middle of the engram!The pc would be a mess!

He got to B and kept right on going.154"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"You should look into some folders where the C/S or auditor dispersed off B orwhere B was reached with no halt.The most recent examples I’ve seen have been taking processes out of oneRundown and using them in another Rundown all in an effort to achieve a maximumeffect when the error that was present came from failure to complete 2 earlier programs.The correct action would have been to complete the earliest program leftincomplete and then complete the next incomplete program, not scramble parts of twonew programs.A to B is a cycle of action. A clean one.It is best to keep it so.The Supreme Test of an Auditor or a C/S is to make Auditing go right—by thebook.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1971by L.

The same somatics will come back again. The case roller-coasters—goes up and down.Drugs since 1962 have been in very widespread use. Before then they were rare. Aworldwide spread of drugs occurred. A large percentage of people became and are drugtakers.By drugs (to mention a few) are meant—tranquilizers, opium, cocaine, marijuana,peyote, amphetamine and the psychiatrist’s gift to Man, LSD, which is the worst. Anymedical drugs are included. Drugs are drugs. There are thousands of trade names andslang terms for these drugs.ALCOHOL is included as a drug and receives the same treatment in auditing.They are supposed to do wonderful things but all they really do is ruin the person.Even someone off drugs for years still has “blank periods”. The abilities toconcentrate or to balance are injured.The moral part of it has nothing to do with auditing. The facts are that:(a) People who have been on drugs can be a liability until the condition ishandled in auditing.(b) A former drug user is a resistive case that does not make stable gains until thecondition is handled.(c) Auditing is the only successful means ever developed for handling drugdamage.156"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"THOSE ON DRUGSOn persons who are currently on drugs, it is necessary to take them through aspecial TR Course while they are still on them. They gradually come off of themvoluntarily in most cases without painful “withdrawal symptoms” (which is the term forthe agony and convulsions caused, particularly in the case of heroin takers, by juststopping the drug. Alcoholics are of course included.)DRUG ENGRAMSPeople who have been on drugs are sometimes afraid of running engrams.In fact, it is almost a way to detect a “druggie”.The drugs, particularly LSD and even sometimes antibiotics or other medicines towhich the person has an allergy, can turn on whole track pictures violently.These tend to overwhelm the person and make him feel crazy. Some of thesepeople are afraid to confront the bank again.The TR and other steps of the special TR Course improve their confront.If a person “doesn’t like Dianetics” and doesn’t want to be run on engrams, it isnecessary to put them on the special course. If Dianetics has been run but poorly, itshould of course be repaired fully with an L3B (List used to correct Dianetic errors). Butif the person still flinches, the Special Course successfully completed will handle. Itcontains recall steps giving the pc a chance to confront the bank more easily and get usedto it.FULL AUDITING RUNDOWNA full auditing rundown on drugs, all done on the same pc, would be:1. Special TR Course for ex-drug users or alcoholics.2. Pc Assessment Form.3. Class VIII Drug Rundown Triple (done by a Class IV or VI).4. By a Dianetic Auditor: Pains, emotions, sensations, attitudes connected withdrugs (or alcohol), R3R Triple.5. Prior Assessment to Drugs, Triple R3R, Dianetic Auditor.This can be followed by routine Triple Dianetics to EP for the grade.DONE FIRSTDrugs are done first. They are NOT done after the Health Form and regularDianetics.Why? Because Drugs make a resistive case! Regular Dianetics will get loses.Any current Dianetic case failures are from flubby Dianetic auditing or the personhas been on Drugs or alcohol which were not handled by Dianetics.It hasn’t harmed anyone to omit drugs. But it made it hard or impossible to getstable case gain.THUS ANY DIANETIC PC WHO HAS HAD DRUG HANDLING OMITTEDMUST BE RUN ON DRUGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE MORE AUDITING ISGIVEN.I repeat, drugs or alcohol in most instances make a resistive case so the point mustbe handled before the case will attain and hold case gain.ANY PC WHO IS NOT MAKING IT IN AUDITING SHOULD BE CHECKED FORA DRUG OR ALCOHOL HISTORY.157"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"DISCOVERYIn investigating a series of cases who were not making it, I found in each one thatthe person had been on drugs or alcohol and that drugs or the alcohol had not been runout.Drug data was not covered fully enough in the Dianetics pack.

PC Assessment Form.2. Full C/S 1, also doing the TRs well with the pc.3. Write down the drugs from the pc assessment form. Take the one that readsbest on the meter.4.

Proceed with routine Triple Dianetics.This program is the one that would be done at step 4 in the full Drug Pgm abovethat includes the TR Course and Class VIII Rundown.However, when only Dianetic Auditors are available, at least the above DianeticProgram must be done.This repairs an omission in the Dianetic pack and unblocks the case gain of a greatmany pcs on whom a drug or alcohol history was never noticed or handled.

Further, we now know MORE about it.If you look into Suppressive Person tech you will find an SP has to be out ofvalence to be SP. He does not know that he is because he is himself in a non-self valence.He is “somebody else” and is denying that he himself exists, which is to say denyinghimself as a self.Now this doesn’t mean all persons whose graphs dropped were active SPs. But itdoes mean they weren’t being themselves.After some auditing they became themselves somewhat and this self isn’t the socialcheery self the first graph said.But the dropped graph is nearer truth.Now, how to get the graph UP again?The person with the dropped graph is closer to being himself but is not yet fullyrestored, not yet fully into his “own valence”.While Class XI would handle this a bit differently, Class VIII rundown already hasan answer.The Class VIII out of valence lists LX1, LX2 and LX3 and the recall, secondary andengram triples for each assessed item from these lists is a way to handle.Completing any cycle the pc is on is of course fundamental. And even if the pcgoes on to next grade the graph will improve.The fact is that the pc is emerging more and more and becoming himself and thenhe himself begins to gain.The graph that dives will come back up if general processing is done.The pc will keep saying he is “more there”.

They sometimes think they are still students. They do not know this fact:A COURSE GRADUATE BECOMES AN AUDITOR BY AUDITING.That means LOTS of auditing.The failure of “auditors” is that they go from one level to the next, HDC to IV to VIII, withoutever becoming an auditor for that Class.Thus you can get a silly situation where a Class IX can’t audit or C/S well. Thus you get techgoing out.An HDC graduate who doesn’t then audit under an experienced Case Supervisor who knows anddemands the standard actions rarely gets to be an HDC AUDITOR. It takes tons of hours to make a realDianetic auditor who can toss off standard sessions and get his routine miracles.So if an HDC doesn’t INTERNE, but simply goes on to the Academy Courses or SHSBC hehas skipped his apprenticeship as a Dianetic Auditor.If he gets his Class VI and never Internes but goes on to VIII well, we now have somebody whohas long since lost touch with the reality of why he is studying.Therefore you CAN’T take a Class VI graduate who was never a Dianetic Auditor and Internehim as a VI. He’ll goof-goof-goof. So you have to Interne him as an HDC.WHEN he can turn out flawless Dianetic sessions on all kinds of pcs you can Interne him as aIV etc.In other words you have to catch up all neglected Apprenticeships.I don’t care if the guy is an VIII, if he wasn’t ever a Dianetic Auditor and a Class VI Auditor andisn’t Interning as an VIII then he is only a provisional.Flubby auditors are the biggest time wasters a C/S has. If auditors on his lines aren’t good, he’lltake forever to get his C/S work done. And he won’t get results.The answer is, regardless of Class as a course graduate, a C/S MUST INTERNE HISAUDITORS FOR EACH INTERNESHIP MISSED ON THE WAY UP.The “ok to audit” system is used.One takes any graduate and Internes him on the lowest Interneship he has missed. He reviews hismaterial, gets his drills checked, gets his misunderstood words cleared163"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":" and gets an “ok to audit” for that level. If he goofs he is crammed. And sometimes whollyretreaded. The “ok to audit Dianetics” would be his first okay. This suspends if he has to retread.When he then has turned out pcs, pcs, pcs, pcs, 5, 6, 8, 10 hours a day for weeks and weeks andis a total success as a Dianetic Auditor, he can go on up.At first as a Dianetic Interne he is part time studying Dianetics. Then as he gets flawless andwhile he is getting experience and practice on Dianetics, he can gradually phase over into re-studyinghis next Interneship, usually IV or VI.Then one day he is word cleared, checked out on his drills, and he qualifies for “ok to audit” forIV or VI.Now it begins all over again. Flubs—Cramming, midnight oil, audit audit cramming audit auditnew word clear new drill work audit audit audit audit 5, 6, 8, 10 hours a day.Now he is a IV or VI auditor.His next real step is a VI or VII Interne at an SH. If he has been a good IV Interne Auditor hisVI Interneship after his SHSBC will be a VII Interneship. VII is an Interne activity.When he’s an Auditor that can do VI and Power, he is ready for VIII and IX.If he is going to be a good VIII-IX auditor he will Interne in an AO or SH under an experiencedC/S.Now when he goes to his own org, you have a real honest to goodness C/S. And as a C/S hemust know how you use Interneships to make auditors.Wherever this function is neglected, you don’t get auditors. You get doubtful students and out-tech.On Flag C/Ses have to catch up every missed Interneship to make a high volume high qualityauditor.The world renowned Superiority of Flag Auditors is built just like I am telling you here.There is no reason just that same quality can’t be built in any org.One does it by the Interne method.By using this method you get IN tech and high volume.Any auditor in any org that is limping and fumbling simply has never been properly Interned.The way to remedy it is to set up a good Cramming that uses only HCO Bs and has themavailable (and no verbal tradition), a Good Word Clearer and a Qual “okay to audit” Interne system. TheInternes are a Section in Qual. They have a Course Supervisor. They study and audit cram audit cramstudy audit, audit audit audit.And one day you have IN tech and high volume high Class auditing all over the place.Otherwise you just have a bunch of students, in doubt, chewing on their misunderstood wordsand failed tech.There IS a right way to go about it.It is by Interneship.L.

He can of course have his ownopinions of the pc’s case. But he is the FRIEND of the pc even when being harsh.Often the C/S, unseen by the pc, is sometimes never suspected but quite oftenadored by those for whom he C/Ses. One often sees this in success stories, “Thankyou, thank you to my great auditor (name) and the C/S (name) and Ron.” Sometimesit’s only the auditor. But mos. pcs know the C/S is there.This awareness is also a great trust and it is a trust that is earned by great resultsand is never betrayed.To the majority of pcs, then, it is a trio—always in the same order—his auditor,his C/S and myself.He trusts us. And we do our best for him.We don’t change our actions, then, if he is a dope addict, a wife beater, acriminal, a degraded being or an upstat (one who has high statistics) and a sterlingperson.When we are researching, C/Sing or auditing, we do our best for him.We have nothing to do with whether his seniors like him or for that matterwhether we like him.It is our job. We hold it in trust.In our hands is his future, his sanity, his immortality.It depends on us whether he survives and lives a full life or whether he goes intolimbo.170"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"If we do our duty, when we know and do our jobs, he achieves everything.When we don’t, he is gone.No priest or fancied idol has ever been endowed with more cause over thebeingness of another than a C/S and his auditor. This isn’t my opinion or my feelingabout it. It’s the way pcs look at it.Actually one can’t really state the full actuality of it.The pc is justified in trusting us when we keep up to date on our tech, know ourjob, take every care that a good job is done and do our duty.AUDITOR OPINIONSome auditors develop overts and withholds on pc and color their auditing reportswith critical remarks about a pc = more withholds.A C/S who pays much attention to these opinions is foolish. When they get toobad on too many pcs, get the auditor’s overts and withholds pulled as he’ll begin toflub.The Worksheet and What the pc said or did is important. The opinions aren’t.An auditor has a right to refuse to audit certain pcs as long as he audits others.That’s as it should be.But a lot of “dog cases” are just unsolved cases that can be solved. Some are verydifficult, true, but the difficulty is finding the bug. Some pcs are rather wild in conduct.But they solve too.So an auditor’s opinion is not a study of the case. Talking to an auditor about acase he is auditing is not of any technical value to a C/S.Again, a case does not know what is wrong with it or it would as-is and wouldn’tbe wrong. So talking to a case about his case is a waste of time for a C/S. Some writehuge notes to a C/S. The only value in all this is to analyze whether it’s a hiddenstandard or an ARC Brk or a w/h or a PTS matter. TECHNICAL considerations are allthat enter in looking over such.EXECUTIVE opinion is the world’s worst source of data on a pc. No C/S shouldever take what seniors say about a junior. It’s all Human Emotion and Reaction. It’snot tech.FAMILY, husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters, aunts anduncles are of little value to listen to about a case. The most they could give you wouldbe a list of accidents or illness or time in a home. But beware, they may be worse offthan the pc.No. The C/S is the pc’s safest friend.The pc trusts the C/S and the auditor. Or he wouldn’t sit still at all.Sometimes he only trusts me. And that’s the time I have to trust you.And I do.  LRH:nt.rd L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1971 Founderby L.

They think general techresults improve only by more tech study. If they continue to think this way they windup squirreling. For they are working on a wrong target for improvement, a wrongWHY or reason.Auditing is a team activity. The day of the individual country doctor is dead. Evenif an individual field auditor starts out as an individual he goes one of two directions—he overworks and squirrels himself into failure or he builds up a team—may only be areceptionist and an apprentice auditor but he is still building up a team. I have neverseen individual auditors succeed over a long period. Failing to form or become part of ateam, they eventually fade out or squirrel.The reason is simple enough.These rules apply:TO IMPROVE TECH RESULTS YOU MUST IMPROVE ADMINISTRATION.And I don’t mean just writing better in folders.DEFINITIONADMINISTRATION consists of the formation and handling of the lines andterminals involved in production.Unless an auditor understands this fully, he will never insist on a Tech Sec, aTech Establishment Officer, D of P, C/S, Examiner, Pages, Folder Admin and himselfwill begin to omit keeping a Folder Summary and then omit the session actions andthen, with big loses, retire from it all.If I were an auditor and saw some of these things missing, I’d be liable to say,“Are you guys kidding? I thought we were here to audit pcs.”Without the correct pattern of lines and terminals YOU DON’T GET RESULTS,you get headaches, mad neighbors and refunds.Auditing on lines, an auditor should regard himself as a highly skilled expert, atechnical specialist whose work requires respect and service.And Case Supervising on lines, a Case Supervisor should consider himself a sortof Czar whose word is so law even the Exec Director thinks several times before heapproaches—duly servile of course and bowing the prescribed three times as he exits.172"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"A Class XII on Flag is listened to by others with a hush even if he is onlycommenting on the weather.These are the stars of the team. Their worldwide reputation for smooth flublessauditing is an administrative result!Short of space, overloaded, short of admin personnel, turning out the highestwell done hours in the world, Flag’s Div IV produces because of an Admin system.The highest of these C/Ses and auditors goes to Cramming if he misplaces acomma or drops a TR 1.If the sessions’ exams at Examiner drop from 90% F/N the whole place getsoverhauled.Folders are Folder Error Summaried by an FES section. The Folder Summary iskept up each session (or Cramming). The folder is studied and C/Sed. The D of Passigns the sessions. The C/S is done correctly (or Cramming). The folder travels onits lines. The tests are done.In short it is a complex but constantly flowing pattern of moving pcs, folders andexaminations interspersed with testing and interviews and re-registration.There is a right way to do it.RESULTSIf an org has only 65% of its sessions F/N VGIs at Examiner the right answer isto organize the place.Why?Well, the first answer is that the third dynamic is stronger than the first dynamic.An auditor auditing alone is a first dynamic. The pc is a first dynamic. As it is theauditor plus pc that must be greater than the reactive mind, one can easily work the restout.If the auditor is part of a functioning third dynamic, not just an individual, theauditor plus pc versus the bank is a LOT more than the bank.Another answer is that an auditor knows the pc, if only because of sessions, andpersonal opinion enters into it. That is not a pure technical view as a C/S’s must be.Another answer is that an auditor in a group gets more auditing done.Individually practicing auditors often fail because nobody is taking care of theauditor as a person. Further they get loses. No one sends them to Cramming. Whenthey get loses they often start squirreling. Then they really get loses.That ends them as auditors.An auditor working in a good on policy organization is given service. He does getsent to Cramming. He does keep his tech updated. He gets wins. When he doesn’t he’sput back on standard tech. So he happily keeps going and makes lots of happy people.So if I were auditing in a group I would insist as a condition of work that Div IVand Div V be good on policy divisions, fully organized with no nonsense.I know whereof I speak. As a part-time duty I work as a consulting C/S with agood IV and a good V. Sometimes I have had to take over the whole C/S line.

It’s pure fact.The F/N-no F/N at Examiner ratio tells you at once if Divs IV and V are organizedand operating or if they are just fooling about.At 50% to 75% F/N at Examiner the administrative functions of Divs IV and Vare stinking bad. C/S Series 25 is out. Cramming is out. Hidden data lines exist. HCOBs, books and tapes are not used.The public, at that % of F/N, will stay away in droves. Registrars will go battyand adopt “Hot Prospect Systems”.The staff will go low pay and the execs will be a perpetual dark shade of purplefrom yelling. The cash-bills ratio will be the subject of finance missions and theneighbors will be phoning the police.Why?Because an org is itself a technical delivery organization and 50% to 75% F/N atExaminer is an overt product.The Academy has already failed to apply student study tech and word clearing.Qual is a joke.There is no library of tech available and if available isn’t read.The org as a tech service delivery unit is treating its public to a no-auditingsituation and will get in trouble.REMEDYThe way to remedy is to get on policy with tech organization.Put in a Qual with word clearing and a library and cramming.Put in the C/S Series 25 Tech lines.Tolerate NO out-tech or out-admin in folders.Dummy run the lines until they’re in.Cram Cram Cram C/S and auditor and tech personnel flubs whenever they occur.Get the organization functioning.Your F/N at Examiner ratio will climb straight up to 90% 95% 98%.By actual test pcs will flood in, Reg lines will get easy, success stats soar.More auditors more C/Ses, more organization.

Auditing flubs are the main things that make a C/S’s joblong and hard and the main thing that denies his pcs high results.For example-with competent auditors I can C/S the day’s folders in 21/2 hours.With green flubby auditors the same number of folders takes 61/2 hours.The answer plainly is to groove the auditors in until they are flubless. And this iswhat a competent C/S does.Because he has internes on his lines and because any group of auditors can bebettered, the training officer part of the C/S hat is one which is always worn.Also, if the Tech-Qual administrative set-up is nonextant or a confused mess, theerrors in folders and various upsets react suppressively both on the C/S and auditorsand they—both C/S and auditors—make mistakes. So the administrative lines andterminals must be there.Thus a C/S out of self-defense is not merely a training officer of auditors but ofother Tech-Qual personnel as well.Officially this hat belongs with the other terminals. But to coordinate theoperation, the C/S has to have a large amount of know-how about the lines andterminals of Tech and Qual. As it is the C/S who is directing the running of cases andas the lines and terminals exist only to obtain auditing results in volume with highquality, no C/S can afford to neglect his duties as a training officer. Otherwise he willpromptly drown.The folder flow must be smooth with no flaps. The auditor-pc assignments mustbe smooth with no lost auditing time. The sessions must occur. The auditors who flubmust be promptly handled. The Cramming Officer in Qual must know his business.The C/S depends on him to get the kinks out of the auditors’ tech and its application.The processing must be paid for adequately or there will be no funds to hireenough terminals and, indeed, there would be no HGC at all. The C/S is trying toobtain Volume, Quality and Viability.By experience volume comes from the whole org working and the auditorsauditing correctly without lost hours spent in fumbles and repairs. Quality comes fromsmooth Tech-Qual lines and hatted terminals and the auditors auditing flublessly.It is not that the C/S is in charge of the whole org. But every point where a C/S ishaving trouble is where an org terminal has broken down. Therefore a C/S has everyright to INSIST upon hatted functioning terminals.The C/S has a definite effect upon the efficiency of an org’s personnel. He canensure the staff gets audited either on his lines or from Dept 13. And he can insist onquality staff staff auditing for it will help keep his own post going.176"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Tech works. It works splendidly. The materials are there.

Make sure his own tech is up to date and do part-time study or retread whereneeded.2.

Now it all gets lessconfusing as one understands what is out when it is out.5. Set up a close fast line with the Cramming Officer so that auditors who flub are inactual fact rapidly straightened out and gotten back to auditing without great timeloss.6. Fend off and refuse to give tech advice as such. KNOW WORD CLEARINGSERIES 16 THOROUGHLY and get a great reality on it and insist that the QualSec and Cramming Officer know it, use it and hammer away with it. Otherwisesuch weird tech confusions will be floating about that even the C/S gets confusedand begins to wonder if the material IS in the books and bulletins!7. Gather up a Tech and Admin Library for fast reference for personal use.8. Get in a system whereby every flub by an auditor, a D of P, a Div IV or V Adminpersonnel, a page, anyone that flubs as it affects the C/S in ANY way gets aCramming chit with the exact reference to be crammed on. Keep a carbon of thechit, send the original to Cramming, get the chit back when done and marked offon the carbon. Keep the Admin of it simple but the execution of it TOTALLYeffective.9. The Qual Sec, Cramming Officer and Interne Supervisor are the close technicallinks with the C/S. In technical matters the C/S is senior. Sometimes the C/S issent to Cramming by the Qual Sec and should accept and do it gracefully.Sometimes there is a Senior C/S in the org (the Assistant Guardian, ED or someother senior exec may be an HSST or even a Class X). In such a case he has theright to cram or send any of these terminals (or any other terminal) to Cramming.Including any Senior C/S, and including any C/S for another Department or forcrew or in the Guardian’s Office, these terminals constitute the tech hierarchy ofthe org: Senior C/S, C/Ses, Qual Sec, Cramming Officer and the InterneSupervisor and they have to hold a hard technical line. The Tech Sec is mainlyconcerned with production and administration and a Tech Establishment Officer isconcerned with establishing. It can happen that a Tech Sec or TEO are also verywell trained technically and if so are part of this technical hierarchy but they arenot necessarily so. Therefore there is a sort of ex-officio technical committee onthe subject of technical matters composed generally of the Senior C/S, C/Ses,Qual Sec, Cramming Officer and Interne Supervisor that monitors the quality ofHGC and Dept 10 auditing. The Director of Training can be advised concerningthe results of his students after graduation in order to remedy his training and assuch is a part of the Committee, as can be the Tech Sec. Most narrowly and mostcontinually Tech quality is between the C/S and the Cramming Officer. Morewidely, the Senior C/S, Qual Sec and Interne Supervisor enter in. And in thewidest sense, the Tech Sec, Tech Establishment Officer and Director of Trainingenter in. It is an error to suppose the C/S and auditors are the technical monitorsof the org. They are the main technical personnel. But a C/S can waste tons oftime by talking to or with auditors beyond an auditors’ conference and can reallyget whizzing if he spends the same time with the Cramming Officer who thencrams auditors and with the Interne Super who then persuades internes tofunction. Knowing who is as important in organization as knowing how. So holdsome meetings small and large and thresh out the bugs.10. Missing materials is a C/S point of upset.“What is a Course” Policy Letter can be out on tech courses to a degree that youwouldn’t believe. Not only no routing form or roll book but NO MATERIALS.178"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"The Books, HCO Bs, tapes MUST be available. They exist. It is suppressive torun a course without them. Pubs Org, CLOs have them. Financial Planning can’tdeny this necessity as they’re what their income comes from.Qual MUST have a complete and safeguarded library for use in Crammingactions.Under Omitted Materials would be omitted meters and at this writing there is norestriction on these and supply is abundant.The “no materials” gag is the last straw for a C/S.Future auditors won’t have a clue and current auditors will have no way to findout.So the C/S must not permit “economy” or plain laziness or “we sent a despatchthree months ago” to get in the road of materials. IT IS CHEAPER TO PUTSOMEBODY ON A PLANE WITH A CHEQUE TO BRING THEM BACK thanto do without materials.So a C/S should definitely defend himself against a “no materials” blockage andhandle it.11. No Study. When one has materials and particularly when one is getting newmaterials a breakdown can occur when the materials, especially new ones, aren’tread.A technical person must keep up with the advances in technology. That is true ofany profession.A primary failure of new technology is (you won’t believe it but it is true) thematerials aren’t read before the process is tried!I have even caught Class IXs out on this, believe it or not, so don’t think it can’thappen.Process G is received. Auditors audit it. Process fails. Why? Auditors never readthe bulletin first!SO BE SURE YOUR AUDITORS READ THE MATERIALS AND CHECKOUT BEFORE THEY DO THE PROCESS.Write C/Ses like this — “Auditor to Cramming to check out on HCO B .When attested, do the following 1. ,,Do this on new materials and, on new auditors, on any materials you believe hemay goof.Why have the first 12 pcs on Process G go sour just because the auditor onlyglanced at the commands and missed the tech?Interiorization Rundowns are still in this category in some areas. The auditordoesn’t study and Clay demo the pack before doing them.

As soon as a C/S finds hisCramming orders getting too thick he should check(a) Is Method 2 (meter) Word Clearing used hard in Cramming as a first action?(b) Are Methods 2 and 3 Word Clearing in use constantly on tech courses?(c) Is Method 1 Word Clearing (full rundown) available and faultlessly done onevery auditor?Get these points IN.Poof! The Hidden Data Line vanishes. (See Word Clearing Series 16.)Word Clearing has been around for years but people sometimes are themselves sofogged by misunderstood words that they don’t hear you at all when you sayUSE WORD CLEARING!13. Invalidation kills auditors. So don’t chew on them any harder than is necessary toget the job done.Get “To Cramming” to mean, “normal procedure even for Class XIIs” .We had one student who every evening gasped with relief that he hadn’t been sentto Cramming. We finally found out that he was really terrified he would be foundout for false study stats!Only when an auditor refuses to go to Cramming do you begin to push.The auditor sent to Cramming to do an action must not do the action on another pcuntil he has been to Cramming on it.This can “hold up production” in somebody’s mind. But how an auditor canproduce anything while flubbing is someone else’s misunderstood, not mine. Hecan’t. Better five hours in Cramming and one good session than no Crammingand five goofed sessions.The real invalidation of an auditor is failing at tech. So don’t let them fail.“Johnny, your TRs are too hard to hear. Get over to Cramming and get hearable”is perfectly acceptable. If it is correct.So Invalidation could be defined as(a) letting an auditor lose(b) correcting things he does right.That’s about the extent of invalidation.14. Auditor morale depends not on PR (Public Relations) or phoney stats. It dependson actual, honest completions.180"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"A well trained auditor allowed to get completions will have high morale.Thus, a C/S must push an auditor toward(a) Flubless tech(b) CompletionsYou keep pushing and he’ll make it.You don’t push or push on the wrong things and he won’t.As to completions try to get auditors to do the whole program so something iscompleted. This is for the auditor not the pc. The Auditor’s Code on a frequentchange of auditors was written for pcs. But it also applies to auditors. Let themcomplete programs. Even if they spend half the day in Cramming. Don’t yankthem off cases. And don’t let your D of P assign auditors to different cases orhe’ll soon have downtone apathetic auditors who never see what their auditingfinally does for one particular pc.Auditor Morale has little to do with anything but the above two things.Also if you have those two things in as a C/S, you will see something newhappen. Pcs will be around slapping auditors on the back and cheering the organd the place becomes a very happy place.So work for auditor morale with pushing them relentlessly toward flubless techand toward completions.____________The above actions are numbered. If a C/S were to work to get these in, one byone, and if he then went over them again and again, he would wind up about the mostcomplimented upstat C/S anywhere around.These are the giant points to get in while plugging along each day C/Sing theusual and handling the noise.The way to get out of cope is to organize. And these fourteen points give asequence of organizational steps that lift one out of cope and into a smooth productivetime of it.The org would become very prosperous.The staff would be very happy.The field would be delighted.Just remember that when you reach an average 700 well done auditing hours, youbetter have a new C/S in training and persuade him to follow himself these 14 points ina new and necessary additional HGC.

That wouldbe programming backwards.The tools of auditing are the Grade Chart Processes and the numerous correctionlists.Like a gardener, a C/S has the choice of numerous tools to raise a flower.If you were to see a gardener digging holes with the lawn mower and cutting grasswith a spade, you would say he needed to be checked out on the use of his tools, whateach is for.Similarly, running Power on someone who needs Dianetics, doing a life repair onsomeone who is ready for R6EW, would be a misuse of tools.Similarly, going on auditing someone on Dianetics who desperately needs his rudsput in or an Interiorization Rundown is wasting auditing and messing up a preclear.Let me give you some examples I have seen recently:A. Case audited through many major actions since his Int RD. Auditor and C/S indespair. Pc not progressing. A C/S 53 disclosed the Int RD was faulty and its repairwas also faulty. Int Rundown was handled. Case began to run. Months of auditinghad been wasted. Needed had been a C/S 53 where out Int would have shown.B. After 200 or more hours of no change in his personality graph (Oxford CapacityAnalysis) the pc came up with the withhold that he was a homosexual and also thathe did not know what “Scientology” meant. About 2 years of auditing had beenwasted. Needed had been Word Clearing and rudiments.C. After scores of hours of no-win auditing and no graph change it was finally decidedto run a GF 40X and found the person practised witchcraft!D. After a year of auditing on major grades all wasted it was finally found that theperson had had a leg injury he was trying to cure that required only a simpleDianetic assist. Today that would be a C/S 54. He had never had a Pc AssessmentForm.E. After racing from POWER to OT III without doing any real auditing or having anychange, it was found on a GF 40X that the whole world had been unreal and theperson could not begin to face the idea of looking at pictures or the bank and hadnot been able to since her first drug experiences. Needed had been ObjectiveProcesses, CCHs, Op Pro by Dup, etc which get a drug addict to look and be aware.All these are simple if flagrant errors in ordering the right program actions.In order to be able to say what should be done on the case, one has to have threethings:1. Data about the case.182"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"2. A knowledge of what lists are available.3. Auditors who can do the actions required.From a C/S point of view, all these things are under the C/S’s control.DATAIn the Class VIII materials the 7 Resistive Cases are described. The full lot of themare now found in GF 40X.There are numerous other lists for assessment.If a C/S really doesn’t know his lists he can order them all, Method 5 and take hischoice of symptoms.Also a C/S can have the pc simply asked questions.From this data a C/S knows why the case is not running well and can order theactions to remedy it.If nothing is wrong, complete the earliest incomplete grade on the Grade Chart.KNOWLEDGEA C/S who is well Word Cleared on his materials and has studied on the coursesknows what things hang a case up more than what other things.This gives one the knowledge necessary to choose what lists.Case no case gain then it’s GF 40X.And to keep from auditing over an out Int RD there is C/S 53.And for chronic aches and pains there is C/S 54.And for “might be anything” there’s a GF.What lists and actions that can be done are for is very easy to sort out.AUDITORSIf a C/S’s auditors aren’t flubless or expert one needs to get in a Cramming andneeds to get hired and interned lots of new auditors. C/S Series 57, “A C/S as a TrainingOfficer”, solves a lot of this. And a Tech Establishment Officer is vital to keep it solved.Then auditors, the numbers and quality of, are not on the C/S’s plate as a continualproblem. Scientologists want to audit. They will go on auditing as long as you makethem audit well enough and C/S for them well enough to keep them winning on pcs.SUMMARYSo the tools of the C/S are1. Data from pcs.2. Knowledge of list uses.3. Knowledge of the Grade Chart.4. Auditors.5. The organization of delivery.LRH:nt rdL RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1971Founderby L.

This isL4B—HCO B 15 Dec 68 amended to 18 March 71.It is used “On Dianetics Lists_____” as the start of each of its questions whenemployed for this purpose.When a pc has not done well on Dianetics and when no other reason can be foundthe C/S should suspect some listing error and order an L4B to be done “On Dianeticlists “ at the start of each question.Each read obtained on the list is carried Earlier Similar to F/N as per HCO B 14Mar 71 “F/N Everything” or, preferably the list is found in the folder and properlyhandled in accordance with what read on L4B.ALL Dianetic Lists can be carried to an item that blows down and F/Ns.This does not mean the item found is now wholly clean. Even though it F/Ned itcan be run by recall, by secondaries and by engrams as found in Class VIII materials.

INTERIORIZATION RUNDOWN IS UNDONE OR MESSED UP.2. FAULTY LISTS HAVE BEEN DONE.3. THE PC IS IN A HEAVY ARC BRK WITH PTPs AND W/Hs.Now each one of these three things “must be done first”.Auditing cannot be done with Int messed up except to handle the Int RD.Auditing cannot be done over bad lists without repairing the lists.Auditing cannot be done over out ruds without putting the ruds in.So WHAT does the C/S do?There is fortunately a different degree of upset in these three things.Int RD trouble is worse than list trouble is worse than out ruds.Therefore the correct C/S would be to1. Repair Int2. Repair Lists3. Put in Ruds.1. Repair Int RD is done by using L3B on each flow. And (on Flag) by dating to blow and locatingto blow.2. Lists are repaired with L4B on each list, preferably with the list available and preferably with theactual list repaired (such as added to if incomplete or correct item found and given to pc).3. And if the pc also had out ruds THESE ARE NOW PUT IN WITH “Have you been audited overan (ARC Brk, PTP, w/h)?” as the pc has been.It will all come out all right if properly done. Very few pcs get that messed up. But when theydo even they can be untangled.If a lot of engrams were also run on top of that and these are also in the mess, repair them lastas a fourth action. And don’t forget to send auditors responsible to Cramming and report C/Ses whoget a case that snarled up.C/S Series 53 is written with the above sequence of handling. But it omits ARC Brks (as thesedon’t raise or lower TA out of normal range). And C/S Series 53 as it is designed only for high or lowTA does not cover the trick of putting in the ruds as “Were you audited over an (ARC Brk, PTP,w/h)?” as it purposely has to omit ARC Brks.Hope this helps.

NEVER FAIL TO FIND AND POINT OUT AN ACTUAL GOOF AND SENDTHE AUDITOR TO CRAMMING.2. NEVER INVALIDATE OR HARASS AN AUDITOR FOR A CORRECTACTION OR WHEN NO TECHNICAL GOOF HAS OCCURRED.3. ALWAYS RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE A TECHNICALLYPERFECT SESSION.By reversing these three things a C/S can wreck and blow every auditor in theplace.By always doing these three things correctly the C/S winds up with splendidauditors.An auditor who knows he goofed and yet gets a well done doesn’t think the C/Sis a good fellow. He holds the C/S in contempt and his auditing worsens.An auditor who didn’t goof and yet is told he did becomes bitter or hopeless andbegins to hate the C/S.The test of a C/S in the auditor’s eyes is “Is he spot on?” meaning is the C/Saccurate in giving the right program, the right C/S, spotting the goof and orderingCramming, and being well enough trained to see and commend a well done.You never get Bad Indicators in an auditor or student when you state the truth.You only get Bad Indicators when your statement is not true.“PR” (Public Relations cheery falsehoods) has nothing to do with getting goodindicators.Good indicators in auditors are made with TRUTH.“You goofed, go to Cramming, do TRs 101 to 104 until you cease to altercommands.”“Well done by Exams.

His wife. So I’llC/S “O/W on your wife”.Some of the time the C/S will be right. This gives him a win and confirms him insloppy C/Sing. He does not bother to know before he C/Ses.A C/S who gets a low percentage of cracked cases and a low percent of F/N VGIsat Examiner usually fails to “know before he goes”. He just goes, which is to say hejust writes programs and C/Ses without finding out enough about the case.A skilled C/S may very well be able to figure out exactly what’s wrong with thecase. That’s his job. But how does he find out anything about the case at all?The answer is very simple. So simple it gets missed. THE C/S GETS DATA ONTHE CASE.How does he do this?The broadest, most used answer to how to know is prepared lists. These have allsorts of questions on them that read or don’t read. There are lots of these listsbeginning with the famous PC Assessment Form. There are all sorts of lists. An endproduct of any list is DATA ON THE PC ONE USES TO PROGRAM AND C/S THECASE.The next answer to how to get data is lists prepared by the C/S himself and whichare assessed by the Auditor.Another answer is 2-way comm on questions written by the C/S. “What do youconsider hasn’t been handled on your case?” is a jewel which gives you the hiddenstandard to List and Null and run Who or what would have to BD F/N Item andO/W on the item found. But there are dozens more. “How do you feel about yourfamily?” “R Factor: The C/S is concerned about your saying your case sags after winsin auditing. Could you tell me exactly what happens and what your history has been onthis?” There is no limit to such questions. And, if taken from what the pc says toExaminer or from auditors’ comments on Worksheets, they will usually F/N. Butmainly they give data.When regular actions fail, there is always the D of P. “D of P to InterviewRichard Roe and find out what he’s trying to do in session. Also how he looks,mannerisms, etc.”Data, Data, Data. Now you have a picture of this case.188"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"COMBINED ACTIONUsually, by prepared lists issued or from C/S prepared lists, the C/S finds andgets handled by the auditor in the same session much of what is wrong. This combinesfinding out with handling.Any prepared list carried to F/N on each read (Method 3) or the indicated actiondone will give case gain. Maybe it’s all the case gain one could ask for.But such reads even if F/Ned and the text in the Worksheet give the C/S new dataabout this case.BROAD SHOOTINGEven if he now KNOWS, the C/S does not narrowly shoot at one target. Hegives alternatives as well in his C/S.Example: C/S knows pc is concerned about F/Ns. He does not necessarily justwrite “Prepcheck F/Ns”. Instead the C/S writes “Assess Auditors, Auditing, Dianetics,Scientology, F/Ns, Processing, false reads. Prepcheck each reading item, taking largestread first.” This gives a broader band, more chance of hitting the button needed.There are many ways to do this. Example: You “know” it is a misdefined word.You don’t C/S “Find the misdefined word”. You write, “Assess Method 3 and Handlethe Word Clearing Correction List”. For you see, the session might also have been runover an out rud.EVALUATIONTo abruptly C/S everything the pc has just said is a Q and A. But worse, it canlead to evaluation.LITTLE FLAGSPc Remarks are like little Flags that may signal a much deeper deposit ofaberration. Only the little flag shows. “I don’t like women,” can uncover a wholebackground. “I keep getting this pain in my side” opens the door to a whole chain ofoperations and one to be done next week!But by the broad rule, the C/S doesn’t dive at it. He says “Pc has pain in side. I .C/S 54.”Not “List the somatics in his side”. But a whole coverage of accidents, illnesses.One will also have a side pain as a result. “Appendicitis Operation” is enough to giveanyone a pain in the side if never audited out!TAGGING CASESA C/S who sees a case is thick foldered and not well tags the case “Resistive”.There are 7 resistive cases listed in the Class VIII material. For this the C/S has “GF40Expanded Method 3” and then handles the lists and engrams indicated in it in his nextC/S.If this doesn’t handle, the case is in an out Ethics situation that should be lookedinto.The C/S mentally tags the easy ones and the tough ones. The tough ones he playson the Resistive Cases side.The C/S can also find an auditor considers a fast case a bad case when it is just afast case.189"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"PRIMARY RECORDThe primary record is the pc’s folder. When the case does not run well it can beassumed that the case is(a) Resistive(b) Errors have been made in auditing.These two assumptions are valid in all cases which do not easily resolve. Theyare both valid because the case, being resistive, was running poorly, was hard to auditand C/S earlier.From the folder, from prepared lists, from C/S’s own additions to prepared lists,from C/S’s own prepared lists, from 2wc on questions and from D of P Interviews onecan get ENOUGH DATA TO INTELLIGENTLY PROGRAM AND C/S A CASE.All this may seem very obvious. BUT, in word clearing the most Common C/Serror has been to fail to order a Word Clearing Correction List done. Instead one reads,“Correct the last word found”. This misses that the whole thing may be being doneover a withhold or ARC Break. It might be another word entirely. So a C/S who doesthis risks the wrong target. He is not C/Sing broadly enough.Also one sees a repair or life program consisting of two or three special processesand without any lists at all.One also sees a program which seeks to handle several things the C/S “knew”were wrong followed by “8. C/S 53, 9. GF 40X, 10. C/S 54.” Having gone, thisprogram then seeks to find out. It’s quite backwards.Thus the C/S who goes before he knows is going to have an awful lot of no F/Nsat the Examiner.The watchword is KNOW BEFORE YOU GO.  L.

It is too much to also ask him touse judgment or work something out while auditing.A veteran on the other hand knows the tools so well that he can also figure outwhat to do.Example:C/S for non-veteran:1. Assess GF Method 5 and return to C/S.C/S for a veteran:1. Assess GF Method 5 and Handle.It is quite a trick to assess a whole list, then take the biggest reads and handle. Itis quite beyond an auditor who is still worrying about his TRs or how you run a meter.In an effort to speed up lines or escape work, a C/S can err badly in this. Itbecomes mysterious why Word Clearing Correction List ceases to work, why F/Ns arefew at the Examiner.Giving an inexperienced auditor the responsibility for assessing a list and alsohandling it is in fact asking him to audit and to a faint degree C/S in the chair. It is quitebeyond a green auditor.Given that he knows his Tech, most of a C/S’s troubles come from(a) Asking green auditors to follow C/Ses for which they have not studied theHCO Bs or on which they have not been crammed,(b) C/Sing for green auditors to decide something in session or combine actionssuch as assessing and handling without a new C/S in between,(c) Not sending the auditor (green or veteran) to Cramming for every goof,(d) Having no Cramming.It takes a while to make an auditor.191"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The C/S is responsible for all actions in the session. He has only himself to blameif he is asking someone to C/S for him in the chair.It is easier to plan out and write up the needed GF actions (or any other list) fromthe Method 5 reads than it is to correct a messed-up handling. It does not save any timeat all but more than likely makes new problems for the C/S.It is very easy to have even a green auditor assess some prepared list. One caneven now say, “Take the list just assessed and do 2wc on each item I have marked.Carry each E/S to an F/N before leaving it.” The C/S simply puts a dash ahead of eachitem that read in the assessment.The C/S can also number the items in different order than the list (because ofbetter programming or bigger reads) and have each one handled to F/N.An L3B can be ordered “Method 5” and then the C/S can get it back and preciselyorder what’s to be done with its reads. And in what sequence.This is true of any prepared list.The only small hitch is that a C/S has to be there and available so as not to stall thesession. Even so, in the long run it is faster because less mistakes are made. Assess—send to C/S—handle. Instead of “Assess and Handle”.This even applies to a C/S 53 or C/S 54 or White Form or GF 40X.

Some auditors go to an extreme of block printing the wholeWIS.The more permanent solution is to have Auditors in Cramming practice writingWELL and CLEARLY no matter how slowly and then, maintaining the same clarity,speed it up. The auditor after many such practice sessions winds up writing clearly andfast. This can be increased until an auditor can write clearly as fast as people talk.The occasional headaches a C/S might get are not from the restim of the case he’sstudying but are from the words on W/Ses he can’t make out.If a C/S does not insist on both block print clarification and auditor writingpractice, he will wind up not reading worksheets and may even get foggy about certaincases.A remedy is to go back to the first folders not understood and get the wordsclarified and then keep this C/S Series HCO B IN.

So if the real WHY is not made known tothe C/S he has a “something is wrong with Joe’s TRs” which hangs up in time and never is resolved.A response from Cramming to an order from the C/S to “check his TRs—Pc’s TA went low insession—” which states: “I checked his TRs and they are good. But he audited the Pc in a room thatwas overhot and the cans were too big. He has been drilled on Auditor’s Code and session environmenthandling and HCO Bs on TA Errors and now has this down pat. It won’t happen again,” leaves the C/Sin no doubt as to what really happened. What’s more he can order this repaired on the Pc by a “2wc ontimes he felt worried about his TA or F/Ns” taken E/Sim to F/N (which will clear it up).Furthermore the Auditor now knows that the C/S knows what the real error was, doesn’t gethung with a withhold or a false idea about his TRs from the C/S.In essence one is putting the Exact Truth on the line.So the following rule is now mandatory in all HGCs and Quals:THE CRAMMING OFFICER IS ALWAYS ON ANY CRAMMING ORDER TO REPORTTHE EXACT OUTNESSES FOUND OR THE EXACT SESSION GOOFS, WITH ANYADDITIONAL DATA, IN DETAIL, TO THE C/S.A C/S receiving a Cramming Order back giving no Why or an unreal Why that does not makesense when compared with the session and its results MUST return the Cramming Slip to theCramming Officer requiring the Why be found or the wrong Why abandoned and the real Why foundand corrected.A good C/S should know his Data Series down cold and be able to spot such outpoints at once.He would go over the session with the Cramming Officer and point out what it is he wants handled.This data is not theoretical but is taken from actual practical experience in C/Sing.

INSPECT THAT F/N, COG, AND VGIs OCCURRED AT THE END OFEACH PROCESS AND ACTION (each chain in Dianetics) AND AT SESSIONEND.(Text is seldom read unless the session did not go well.

The bugs afterthe high point should be repaired as the fast action to set the case going again.The repair and handling of bogged cases is the finest skill of a C/S. Really it iswhy he is there.To do this he has to know the C/S Series thoroughly, know all the materials of alllevels he is C/Sing better than the auditor.The use of prepared lists, WC Correction List, Green Form, C/S 53, Hi-Lo TA,GF 40 RR, Int-Ext Corr List, L1C and others, including “Have Examiner ask the pcwhat happened in session” are used to get information and correct as well as folderstudies.

It is part of theCramming Officer’s responsibility to prevent Wrong Target correction. According toQual Senior Datum, the Cramming Officer must not take orders but must do his owninvestigation and handling. It will be found that there is usually a valid corrective actionto be made.

He MUST understand his title and whatits duties involve.It is his job to get people PROCESSED.To do this he has to KNOW (a) what people there are to be processed, (b) howmuch processing they will need, (c) what facilities can be maintained and expanded toget processing done and (d) to see that the processing is paid for and occurs.The D of P does not have to be a C/S or to know C/Sing.ALL HE HAS TO KNOW OF TECH IS HOW TO READ AN OCA, IQ,APTITUDE AND OTHER TESTS.He does not even have to open a folder. If all he ever looked at was a pc’s OCA(Oxford Capacity Analysis or by some other name) the D of P would win every time.If the D of P considered his job as “To raise OCAs with paid for processing andto be sure the pc is happier” he would be performing his duties.To raise OCAs one has to know how to “read” an OCA. That’s easy. It says howright on its border. Unacceptable, Needing Improvement, Desirable, etc.An OCA with any point on the left side of the graph in low or undesirable rangemeans the pc is out of valence. Any low point on the right side of the graph means thepc is crazy.If the graph is not in the desirable range and the pc happy and looking better, theHGC has not done its job yet.The D of P goes wholly on the idea of MORE AUDITING when he wants toraise a graph or IQ.It’s not up to the D of P what is audited only that auditing is done. The C/S, if heknows his business, will say what is audited. The D of P just knows MOREAUDITING.A D of P can tell by the OCA improvement and improvement of TONE andAPPEARANCE of the pc and what the pc says in an interview whether the requiredhigh quality result has been achieved. If it has not, then it’s MORE AUDITING.The REGISTRAR can have very similar functions as to graphs and where there isno D of P the REGISTRAR must do these things.A D of P who has a backlog is a dog. It means he isn’t getting auditors orrecruiting Academy students or getting people to Auditor Interne and isn’t BEING byDEFINITION a D of P.205"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"If there is an “ARC Broken field” look at the D of P. He didn’t see that the OCAwas raised and that the pc was happy before he left the org.A good D of P has a potential processing line of EVERY OCA EVER GIVEN BYTHE ORG.He is in the business of raising graphs and making people happy with theirauditing IN PAID VOLUME. If his HGC isn’t turning out 700 well done hours aweek, he’s failing. If he is, he’s a success. If he turns out more, a second HGC isneeded.The traffic cop is the D of P.He has to know what traffic he will have and what traffic he does have.He can be defeated by a poor registrar, a poor C/S and a poor Qual. Therefore hehas the right to demand these people get hatted. But he only has the right if he himselfis hatted and doing his job. Given that he can demand Comm Evs.If a D of P exists, knows his job and does it an org will become prosperous.The first thing he has to know is the meaning of his TITLE.The second thing is that his job is getting OCA graphs raised IN PAID FORVOLUME.(By current US rates a D of P should be running at least a $17,000 cash gross ofauditing through an HGC each week to be considered a competent D of P.)Any “field ARC Breaks” is a direct reflection on the D of P. He didn’t raisegraphs and see people were happy before leaving.During periods when the post of D of P was empty or “not on the org board” ornot filled, the org has slumped.The post is very important.It is also a very simple, direct post.Its duties are covered in C/S Series 25 along with others. But his use of the OCAis not listed there.Procurement of auditors is currently the weakest point of a D of P’s duties.Without this he cannot deliver volume. I have known Ds of P to train auditorsthemselves to have auditors and others to train Academy Graduates after the course tohave quality.There are no limits on what a D of P can do—So long as he is DIRECTING PROCESSING and RAISING OCAs in paidvolume.

He getsauditing. He takes another test that shows what the auditing did by August. Ifsomewhere along this line a test I/C or D of P word clears him on the test, the test-willchange. Entering this variable wipes out any possibility of establishing what theauditing did for the case.Example: If a child is measured as to height and then fed certain foods to see if hewill grow and then someone changes or stretches the tape by which he was measured,you can’t find out if the food did any good.In science this is known as holding a constant.We don’t give a hoot in hell if the pc understands the test or not. The next time hetakes it he’ll probably have the same misunderstoods but he’ll have a change of opinionor even have a new cleverness or better memory and the test will change.Therefore none of these things may ever be done:1. Never tell the pc the right answers to a test.2. Never tell a pc to look up words on a test he doesn’t understand.3. Never word clear the question sheet for a pc on any test.4. Never answer a pc’s question as to what a question means.DO THESE THINGSA. Be sure any test person grasps this HCO B fully so he knows what a test is andwhy we test people.B. Never let a person who falsely reports routinely near a test line.C. Safeguard test answer sheets from being known or seen by unauthorizedpersonnel.D. Use 2nd test and 3rd test question sheets, each different from the 1st one. (Testsare issued this way.)E. Give other tests (Aptitude or OTIS etc) to compare with the second or third OCAor APA if it is in doubt to see if the OCA has been “word cleared” or falsified.F.

This207"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"question is asked before the question asking him if he wants to attest.

If an INSTANT read is gotten on the firstquestion above, the Examiner does not ask the second question, and sends thefolder back to the C/S.G. Require a meter check at Success with the TA position and needle behavior notedon the Success form. Those with high or low TA and/or not F/Ning are not validsuccess stories. The success person makes the meter check after the story iswritten, notes it without pc seeing it and smiles and acks. He does not refuse thestory as it will ARC Break the pc. But he must call it to the attention of the DistSec and Qual Sec that a false attestation and poor result came from Div IV and itmust be taken off Div IV’s stat.H. Both Examiner and Success must know of the False TA HCO Bs so they don’tput the pc on wrong cans or use cans when the auditor used footplates.This safeguards our test line.The test line is a check on C/S and auditing quality. We are not trying to find outif Dianetics and Scientology work. We know that. We are trying to find out by test,Examiner and Success if it is being properly taught and applied in Div IV and Dept ofPers Enhancement.HONESTY is a primary requirement on test lines. PR types that falsify to attainstatus or seem good fellows need not apply for these posts and shouldn’t be on them.THE PC OR STUDENT DEEP DOWN KNOWS WHETHER HE HAS MADEIT OR NOT.If you or tests tell him he’s made it when he hasn’t he will get a false opinion ofyou and doubt you.If you tell him he hasn’t made it when he has he will get a false opinion of you.He will think you don’t know your business and blow.SANITY is basically HONESTY and TRUTH.When false data or altered data is entered this is ABERRATION.So be honest and run a sane D of P, Examiner, Success and TEST line.

For some reason C/Ses are being inventive insteadof following the C/S Series and doing standard repairs and grades.Probably the failure to use Prepared Correction Lists derails the use of standardactions.There are very few actions which do not have their own Correction Lists.THERE IS NOTHING IN DIANETICS AND SCIENTOLOGY ASMIRACULOUSLY WORKABLE AS CORRECTION LISTS.The only things which prevent the list from working are(a) AUDITOR’S METERING(b) AUDITOR’S TRs.METERINGWhen the auditor’s meter is habitually placed where he cannot see (1) The meterneedle, (2) The worksheet and (3) The pc WITH ONE DIRECTED LOOK, then hemisses reads.All three have to be seen at once.The faults arei) Eyesight poorii) Glasses rims obscure one while looking at anotheriii)Position of the meter.It is a Standard Cramming action to look into these points WHENEVER ACORRECTION LIST IS SAID TO BE BLANK.For example a GF is done by Auditor A on Monday. It is done again by AuditorB on Tuesday. Reads are found by B. This means Auditor A is missing reads.THIS IS FAR MORE COMMON THAN BELIEVED.TRsWhen an auditor can’t be heard or is overwhelming the pc the list won’t be valid.209"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"An auditor’s TRs show up more quickly on a Correction List than anything else.A pc ARC Broken by TRs 0 to IV will not read properly on a Correction List.NUMBERS OF LISTSThe number of Correction Lists is large.It is unthinkable to do Word Clearing without ever using a WC Corr List. Yet wefind folders with bogged Word Clearing sessions where the list was never used.There is the Green Form for general case upset, the Green Green Form for Solo,L 1 C for ARC Brks over a period, L3B for Dianetic bogs, L4B for listing and nullinggoofs, Int RD Corr List for Int-Ext corrections, a Power Corr List for Power, GF 40Rfor resistive cases, C/S 53 and Hi Low TA for TA misbehavior, L7 for ClearingCourse, and others.C/Ses trying to “solve cases” without using Correction Lists is like trying torepair flat tires without puncture patches—it just CAN’T BE DONE.THE PRIMARY TOOL OF A C/S IS PREPARED CORRECTION LISTS.It is not inventive ways of “solving cases”.METHOD OF USEWhere you have inexpert auditors you always order Method 5, which is just a fullrapid assessment. Then the C/S sorts out the reads and C/Ses what to do as very wellcovered on the lists themselves and the C/S Series.Then the auditor does the C/S.A Green Form is always done this way. It will bog on any other method like 3.There are different methods of handling lists.

Result—failure. Right Action—Complete Dianetics before R6. RightAction—let it go until OT III well begun, then complete Dianetics.Example: Pre OT doing OT II. A new PTS RD is done. Failure. Right Action-doit before R6 or after OT III.Example: R6 done. Drug RD given. Result. Poor. Right Action—Do Drug RDbefore R6.EXCEPTIONIt will be found that a pc cannot confront doing Solo Grades. The reason will befound to be Drugs. All pcs who “cannot run engrams” CAN run Drug Engrams. Theyare afraid because they get into the bank heavily when on Drugs. Only Drugs can berun.So a pc who has “done R6 and Clearing Course but hasn’t made it” will be foundto be a rabbiting (frightened and running away) druggie. He can and will run DrugEngrams.Thus the right action is to do a full Drug Rundown, then start the pc all over againat R6.It is an exception only because he hasn’t done his Solo anyway.REPAIRSWhere a Pre OT hasn’t made the grade of a Solo level (or gets sick afterwards) afull repair must be done and the failed grade must be completed before he goes on up.It is possible to repair a Pre OT between R6 and OT III so long as you are nottrying to handle his whole case but only repairing the grade he missed.TRsNever order TRs after Solo Materials study or before OT III is attested.TRs should be done before or during Solo Auditing study but not after materialsare issued. And the TR Course may not be done from then on to OT III.211"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"A partially completed earlier TR Course found to be hanging up a pc on SoloGrades can be handled to completion and should be. This does not mean longadditional hours of TR 0. It usually means word clearing on the TR materials andrehab.MAJOR ACTIONSIt is a very losing game to throw a major rundown in between R6 and OT III.Such as L10 after Clearing and before OT I. The result is a mess.The way to recover such a blunder is to get the pc rehabbed or to a rest point andthen finish up the Solo Grades to OT III attest and then complete the rundown.SET UPIt is therefore VERY important that a pc be fully set up including Dianetics beforehe is let onto R6 Solo materials study.AUDITING SKILLNone of this states that you cannot improve a pc’s auditing skill between R6 andOT III (excepting only TRs).BIG wins are to be had by doing so.THE MAJOR CAUSE OF FAILURE ON SOLO GRADES IS THE INABILITYTO AUDIT.You can take a Pre OT who didn’t really make Clear or OT I and move him backto R6 study and retread him as an auditor and then let him move back up the line andhe’ll win.The sources of failure on Solo are1. No Drug RD.2. Dianetics Incomplete.3. Case not set up.4. Inability to audit.SUMMARYRealize that from R6 to OT III you have a closed band for other major actions.So don’t let people onto R6 Auditing who have points 1-4 out.If it has happened, patch it up as you can and let the pre OT get on with it.Then after the first OT III attest, do whatever you like or that needs to be donebefore sending him on to OT IV.

It is a skill.But we have had high and low TAs solved for nearly a year and don’t have to talkthem down anymore as a constant action.Auditors SHOULD know how to do it, and then use it as a rare action.The right way to handle a high TA is to:Do HCO B 24 Oct 71, HCO B 12 Nov 71, HCO B 15 Feb 72, each named FALSETA if it has not been done by the auditor on the pc.THEN if TA is high don’t talk it down or do unusual solutions, do a C/S Series 53or a Hi-Lo TA Assessment and handle.

Self auditing is out of session wondering and chewingon bank.A Solo PreOT must NOT self audit.He ends the session he has done when he ends session on his worksheet.He then goes to Examiner and gets his exam.

It is in fact common.We do have the auditing tech to handle now.The material has to be applied correctly just like any other material.The reason we do the rundown is not to do some sessions or sell some auditing orjust explain why the person is like that. We do the rundown so the person will no longerbe PTS.The (EP) End Phenomenon of the PTS RD is attained when the person is well andstable.As a C/S you MUST put a YELLOW TAB marked PTS on a PTS PC Folder thatstays on until the person is NO LONGER PTS.If you do NOT do this there will be about 25% of your pcs or more that YOUWILL BE IN CONTINUAL TROUBLE WITH! Because you will be C/Sing auditing for aperson who is PTS, will be ill, will rollercoaster because the person has NOT been handledto EP on being PTS.These people, by the way, will tell you, “Oh, I’m not PTS.” “But your father issuing the org.” “Oh yes, I know, but it doesn’t bother me. Besides my illness is fromsomething I ate last year. And I rollercoaster because I don’t like the Examiner. But I’mnot PTS.” The mystery is solved when you find they haven’t a clue what the letters meanor what the condition is, so give them a copy of HCO PL 5 Apr 72 and let them read it.

Also: a hurriedly planned and executed program (as of studies).”What happens in auditing, for instance, is a “Grade Zero Expanded” is “done” byjust doing a single flow to its first F/N.That is obviously “quickie”.A more subtle one is to do a “PTS Rundown” with no Ethics action to begin andno check for stability, holding gain and not ill a week or two after the RD. Only if boththese actions were done would one have a “Complete PTS Rundown” as it would givea PRODUCT = A PC no longer PTS.So what makes a Quickie “completion” quickie?Is it length of time? Not necessarily.Is it fewness of processes? Not necessarily as Power can be done quickie simplyby not hanging on for the EP and only going to F/N.To define COMPLETE gives us the reverse of Quickie.“COMPLETE: To make whole, entire or perfect; end after satisfying all demandsor requirements. “ A Completion is “the act or action of completing, becoming completeor making complete”.So “completing” something is not a loose term. It means an exact thing. “Endafter satisfying all demands or requirements” does not mean “doing as little as possible”or “doing what one can call complete without being detected”.Anything that does not fully satisfy all requirements is QUICKIE.So “quickie” really means “omitting actions for whatever reason that wouldsatisfy all demands or requirements and doing something less than could be achieved”.In short a quickie is not doing all the steps and actions that could be done to makea perfect whole.Standard auditing actions required for ages that auditors cleared each word ofeach command. Yet when they went quickie they dropped this. When this wasdropped, GAINS ON 75% OF ALL PCS LESSENED OR VANISHED.

FESs for past errors are often omitted.To slow down the torrent of quickie actions on clearing commands HCO P/L 4Apr 72 Issue III “Ethics and Study Tech” has Clause 4 “An auditor failing to clear eachand every word of every command or list used may be summoned before a Court ofEthics. The charge is OUT TECH.”Ethics has to enter in after Quickie Tech has gotten in. Because quickie tech is asymptom of out ethics. HCO P/L 3 April 72 (Est O Series 13) “Doing Work” and HCOP/L 4 Apr 72 (Est O Series 14) “Ethics” are vital know-how where a C/S is faced withQuickie actions—or flubby ones that will not cure.Essential Quickie Tech is simply dishonest.

Such upsets also come from word clearing byincompetent persons.The C/S should look for these especially when such campaigns are in progress.He should suspect them as a possibility when a case bogs.A C/S must be sure all such papers and worksheets get into pc’s folders.A common repair action is to1. Do an assessment for type of charge.2. Handle the charge found by the assessment done.3. Fly all the reading items found on such assessments by 2wc or directhandling.4. Suspect LISTING ERRORS on any Why or purpose or product found eventhough no list exists and reconstruct the list and L4B and handle it.5.

Ask the pc forhis somatics and he blows up or goes into apathy. Or blows.

The Auditor has onlyone chance to repair the Pc with the right Correction List. If this does not handle, the Pcis still red tagged and the folder must be gotten to the C/S fast and the Out Techcorrected within 24 hours of the original red tag.The earlier issue of this Bulletin which permitted Auditors to count auditing hourslost on a salvage red tag session is cancelled.Additionally, if a red tag Pc is NOT handled immediately by the Auditorconcerned, the existing penalty of loss of the auditing hours which resulted in the RedTag session is DOUBLED. For example, if the Auditor audited a 2 hour session, he ispenalized 4 hours if he fails to take his Pc straight back into session.This DOUBLE penalty is purely for the Auditor concerned and does NOT affector change other penalties connected—the Examiner’s 24 Hour Rule per HCO PL 8 Sept70R and the Paid Comps penalty per HCO B 30 Aug 71 RC, Rev. 6 Feb 74.The intention here is to increase Auditor responsibility for the preclear anderadicate the incidence of Out Tech.Qual Secs must get in on Policy daily HGC Auditor and Interne study, TRs anddrills period.

One pc who had been on LSD for years had only a Ihour quickie drug rundown. Later this person relapsed.Tracing this, in each case the “Interest?” question had been used and the pc hadreplied “No interest” BUT MEANT “I’M NO LONGER INTERESTED IN DRUGS.”So Drug items that have read are run R3R without asking for interest. Thecommand is simply omitted.In Expanded Dianetics the same thing has occurred in running Evil Purposes orIntentions. The Auditor asked the pc if he was interested in running the item and the pcsaid “No” and so it went untouched. But the pc had it confused with interest in doing thepurpose and missed running it and then fell on his head later. Tracing the case back itwas found that R/Ses and such had not been run due to the pc saying “No Interest”.Nothing bad will happen if the item is run.C/S RESPONSIBILITYThe C/S must keep telling his auditors, on drugs or Expanded Dianetics, “Omitasking for interest on R3R on these (drug) (intentions). Run them if they read on themeter.”REPAIRIn repairing cases it is good sense to check this point on drugs and intentions to seeif they were neglected in R3R due to “no interest”.If so, then have them run and the case will suddenly do well.LRH:nt.ntm jh  L.

It is assessed Method 3. It can also be done M5 on a very ARCBroken pc. EP is area of BPC handled with pc F/N and VGIs. The L1C is not continued beyonda good cog with VGIs and a wide F/N.GREEN FORM: Used for general case clean-up particularly on an out rud type pc or when rudswon’t fly.

May bereassessed after handling all reading items if heavily charged on first assessment. Can also bedone M3 to a good win and F/N VGIs.FALSE TA CHECKLIST: (HCO B 29 Feb 72, Revised 23 Nov 73) Normally done early inauditing, especially if TA high or low. Prevents unnecessary repair due to wrong cans or grip. Isusually only done once. Do not suddenly interject this action into the middle of a session norchange from cans to footplates mid-session due to TA going high.C/S 53RH: This is the basic list to get TA up or down into normal range. Assessed M5, readingitems handled then reassessed, etc. to F/Ning assessment. Done well with good basic auditingthis action should not need to be frequently repeated on a case. TA going high or low in laterauditing after C/S 53RH already fully handled is normally handled with the correction list forthat action (e.g. L4BR when TA high after listing or WCCL on word clearing, etc.).

If a pc gets sick after word clearing, don’t start running R3R, use the WCCL. IfTA goes high during or shortly after word clearing, don’t use a C/S 53RH, use the WCCL.

The full EP of pcwilling and able to study well would require each step of Primary Correction RD completed insequence if pc had been having study trouble. (Ref: HCO B 30 March 72, Revised 30 May 72.)AUDITING TOOLS DRILLIt is vital that any auditor or C/S knows exactly which correction list to use and when to use it.This is particularly true of auditors in session who can and must use the L1C, L4BR, L3RD or WCCLin session when trouble occurs in order to quickly remedy the action and complete the sessionsuccessfully without having to end off prematurely for C/S instructions.For this purpose the auditing tools drill has been developed by LRH. In this drill the coach has apile of the various correction lists, holds each up in any order and asks, “When do you use this?” “Howdo you use it?” Auditor must answer correctly without comm lag. When the auditor can do this withouterror coach then varies the drill by giving session situations and auditor must state the appropriatecorrective action to be taken.A flunk is always handled by having the student restudy the relevant HCO B (never by coachinterpretation). Any disagreement or confusion is handled by appropriate word clearing on the materialsconcerned.REPAIRING THE PC INSTEAD OF THE AUDITORExcessive use of repair lists and having to redo correction lists already done results from flubbyauditing. Don’t just carry on repairing the pc. Get the auditor crammed especially on basic auditing,especially TRs and metering. Then you can get the pc rapidly and effectively repaired and back onto theGradation Chart.“DO NOT LET AN AUDITOR TOUCH SUCH LISTS ON A PC UNTIL HE HAS BEENCRAMMED ON TRs, METERING AND ASSESSING.”—LRH.HANDLING TROUBLE BEFORE IT OCCURSTo use a correction list in session every time the TA starts to go up or pc gets misemotional isQ&A and will slow up auditing tremendously. The correct action is to be an expert in basic auditing,231"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"to know the action you are running, and run the process to its EP. TAs do go high and low duringprocesses. Pcs do sometimes get misemotional when running certain actions. This doesn’t call for acorrection list as there is nothing to correct. One simply completes the process.GRADATION CHARTThe EP of a Repair Program is stated in C/S Series 3 as “the pc feeling great and feeling he canget case gain”. It does not say every correction list or every repair action ever devised having been runon the pc.If one goes past the EP of repair you then will have to repair the pc.THE CASE GAIN AVAILABLE TO THE PC IS CONTAINED IN THE PROCESSES OFTHE GRADATION CHART WHICH IS THE BASIC AUDITING PROGRAM OF EACH PC.Failure to repair a pc who does need repair denies that pc the gains obtainable from processes.Repairing a pc who is doing well or continuing to repair a pc beyond the EP of repair also denies thegains of auditing.The solution is to be an expert in basic auditing, know the processes down cold, know uses ofcorrection lists and use them only when required and then use them correctly and get the pc back ontothe Gradation Chart with a minimum of delay.Training & Services AideRevised & Reissued as BTBby Flag Mission 1234I/C: CPO Andrea Lewis2nd: Molly Harlow2nd Revision by CS—4Approved byL.

The C/S makes sure Tech Courses are taught okay and raises hell until they are.2. C/S makes sure Qual has a Cramming Officer and crams him until he gets flublessCramming and can Supervise TRs, do WCing Method 7, Method 6, Method 4, cancorrect metering and has packs to hand for reference.3. The C/S follows a very standard handling of auditors:A. 1 error of any kind—instruct by reference to HCO B.B. A second error of any kind—send to Cramming and get the Auditor crammed atonce, without any loss of auditing time but before the Auditor is allowed to auditfurther. (This is 2 hours, not 2 days!)C. A third error of any kind—RETREAD, wherein the Auditor’s weak areas arelocated and the Auditor has to M7, M6, M4 and restudy the materials of that area.This takes the Auditor back to Step A.A retread under a good Super takes 4 or 5 days.Now if the Auditor again errs he goes to Step A.If he goes the route again he hits RETRAIN and is retrained fully like any other student. HisPRD is done or verified and he goes through the course starting with basic books. This puts theAuditor back to A.But if he now lands at RETRAIN again he is given a full and complete RETRAIN from hisearliest contacts with the subject.It is highly unlikely he will flub further but if he does, he should not be on auditing at all.FALSE REPORTSA falsified Auditing report puts the Auditor at once at retrain as he is not sufficiently aware ofthe potentials of the subject to know he can get results and does not have to be dishonest.TR 0OT Zero and TR 0 are the keys to good auditing.2 C/Ses were found in orgs who “wouldn’t let the Auditors do TR 0 because of their cases”.Both orgs had horrible stats and bad results and ARC Broken fields.OT Zero and TR 0 are a routine action for Auditors. They do TRs in spare time, not becausethey are being Crammed, just to get professional.Every Cramming Order includes TRs, especially Zero, to also be done on the auditor’s owntime.This gets the Auditor up to really Confronting. His errors come mainly from an inability toconfront (and from faulty metering or misunderstoods or out ethics).OT Zero and TR 0 are the keys to flubless auditing.233"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"ELECTRONIC ATTESTAuditors using LRH tapes and electronic attest (and with OT Zero, TR 0, metering, and Mis Uscleaned up and Ethics in) become very spectacular auditors in terms of results.Results bring pride.Auditors who get results are happy auditors. And the above is how, the standard how, to getthem to get results.EASY C/SINGOnly if he spends some of his time TRAINING, as above, can a C/S ever get down to reallyC/Sing cases and getting programmes DONE.SUMMARYThe above is the way I C/S and handle Auditors as a C/S.I long since found that the flubby Auditors were the ones who consumed the C/S time. Theratio is 21/2 hours to 61/2 hours wherein it only takes me 21/2 hours to C/S piles of folders when I havethe auditors auditing honestly and flublessly and it takes me 61/2 hours when I have some flubbers.It is neither kind nor decent to let Auditors lose. Only when I (or MSH) have not been doing theC/Sing has auditing gone wrong in any area where I was.This is traced directly to the drop-out of the above actions. So it is the above actions which givestandard results and any C/S who omits them (to be a good fellow, or “these are my friends”) is anAuditor killer.Auditors sometimes achieve a high status and are “above being crammed”. Well watch it, watchit because they will fall on their heads with a crash.An auditor is not unlike a race horse. He needs a lot of care and handling. And he needs hisperiodic drills and exercises or he goes sloppy. Like a race horse, a good auditor is very, very valuable.And all good auditors are made by C/Ses!The proof is that even the best go bad when they no longer have a tight C/S rein. Experiencehas taught that. The exceptions are very, very few and you don’t have any of them.It takes me about 3 or 4 weeks to get an auditor through his course and doing a good flublessjob. The majority of Scientologists want to be auditors. So you have Auditor scarcity? That’s a laugh.It’s the C/S! The Course Super, the Cramming Officer.And it’s done just exactly as above.Given the materials, there is no other answer. So stop dreaming of hiring or getting perfectAuditors.The ones you have are fine. Get more.And do the above! ! !The auditors must not blame the pc (nor must you), the C/S must not blame the auditor.It’s you, the Course Super and the Cramming Officer.

An FES maybe called for but does not waive the 24 hr rule.A Red Tag is placed on the front of a folder by the Pc Examiner, C/S, Senior C/Sor Qual Sec for one or more of the following reasons:A. No F/N at Exams after a session, word clearing, product or post purposeclearing or Why Finding or 3 May 72 PL or PTS Check.B. Roller-coaster bad exam report within a few hours of a session.C.

EXAMINER PAPER CLIPS A RED TAG TO THE EXAM FORM, LOGS THEEXAM IN THE EXAMS LOG BOOK IN RED AND BODY ROUTES (ORGETS IT BODY ROUTED BY QUAL PAGE) THE EXAM FORM INTO THEHANDS OF THE DTS FOR IMMEDIATE HANDLING. THE DTS NOTIFIESTHE D OF P.3. If red tagged after a session the Auditor is expected to take the Pc back intosession for the appropriate correction list. If this has been done yet the Pc remainsred tagged the Auditor must immediately write up the session for the C/S.

Once the folder is C/Sed the DTS ensures that the session takes place.8. After the session is given and Pc is now F/Ning, the Auditor, Pc and folder revertto routine traffic lines. The C/S would remove the red tag at this point.9. ALL red tags must be seen by the Snr C/S preferably before the next session.This may not always be possible in orgs where the Senior C/S has other duties.In no case should this take more than 24 hours and, in most, it should be handledthe same afternoon or evening.None of this, of course, relieves the Auditor (even if taken off the case by reasonof retread, retrain or higher class Auditor needed) of his responsibility for seeing thathis Pc is rapidly handled and F/Ning again.As the HGC operates on Intensive Auditing, bit and piece repair actions would bedisruptive of scheduling and delivery. For that reason an Org would do well to invest ina Qual Emergency Review Auditor to handle Word Clearing and Why Finding flubs,assists for loss, illness and injury, student review, etc. In that case the DPE and QualPage would substitute for D of P and DTS in the line. The HGC would handle its ownred tags as part of their intensives.In order to ensure no red tagged Pcs get lost, on lines and not handled in 24 hoursthe following must be done:Pc Examiner sends a daily list at the end of each day of all Red Tags to theCramming Officer and Senior C/S. For the C/S this provides a confirmatory lineagainst his own marked Red Tags for the day. For the Cramming Officer, this providesdata on who should be sent for Cramming. If those persons do not report forCramming within 24 hours, the Cramming Off must report to the Dir Correction orQual Sec for investigation and handling. The Examiner must verify that any RedTagged Pc has been handled within 24 hours or report any not handled to the SeniorC/S, Qual Sec and Dir I & R for investigation and handling. When handled he crossesoff the Red Tag in his log.AOs AND SOLOAll the above applies to Solo Auditing also and a Red Tagged Solo Auditor mustkeep himself available for a Cram, Solo Repair C/S or Review Session. His folderwould get immediate C/S attention._________Regardless of whether the Red Tag was handled or not any non-F/N sessionlogged by the Examiner is included in the Senior C/S F/N Percentage stat. The PdComps bonus for F/N percentage remains as per the Pd Comps BTB.A D of P is well advised to have an Auditor on standby who is not assignedregular Pcs, to handle Red Tag repair sessions when the Auditor cannot complete theaction, through retread or retrain required.238"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The Qual Sec and Senior C/S are responsible for getting this line in and drilledand the Qual Sec is responsible for maintaining it.

In the case of lists to correctlisting, and in particular the C/S 53 series, it is nearly impossible for this situation to occur.A C/S will very often see that the auditor has assessed the list on the pc, has gottenno reads, and the list did not F/N.A “reasonable” C/S (heaven forbid) lets this go by.Yet he has before him first-class evidence that the auditor1. Has out-TRs in general,2. Has no impingement whatever with TR-1,3. Is placing his meter in the wrong position in the auditing session so that hecannot see it, the pc and his worksheet,4. That the auditor’s eyesight is bad.One or more of these conditions certainly exist.To do nothing about it is to ask for catastrophe after catastrophe with pcs and tohave one’s confidence in one’s own C/Sing deteriorate badly.An amazing number of auditors cannot make a prepared list read for one of theabove reasons.Putting in suppress, invalidation or misunderstood words on the list will either get aread or the list will F/N.The moral of this is that prepared lists that do not read F/N. When prepared lists thatdo not read do not F/N or when the auditor cannot get a prepared list to F/N, seriousauditing errors are present which will defeat a C/S.In the interest of obtaining results and being merciful on pcs, the wise C/S never letsthis situation go by without finding what it is all about.L.

There are only failed C/Ses and Auditors.In a recent test; this was proven conclusively. A number of no-case-gain, slow-case-gain, sickie and “failed cases” were rounded up. Using well trained Flag Auditorsand the most basic of lists, every one of these cases was soon flying.At another time, lists which had been “nulled” by a group of trainee Auditorswere then taken over, on the same pcs, same lists, and renulled by Class Xs. Over halfthe reading items had been missed by the trainees—they simply couldn’t make the listread on the pcs. Yet the lists were as alive as skyrockets. The pcs, under the traineeAuditors, had accumulated all manner of by-passed charge by having reading itemsignored. And in some cases, having non-reading items given attention.To a trainee, all this seems incredible and mysterious. He does not realize howvery bad his metering can be, how faint and fainting his TR 1. He has numerous trickswhich defeat him—such as keeping his sensitivity on 32 for a pc who only requiressensitivity 1, whereas the Auditor misses all his F/Ns as he can’t keep the needle at set.He doesn’t put his meter so he can see pc, paper and meter dial all in the same scope ofvision and misses the reads. His Auditor presence is so poor and his attitude sounprofessional that the pc isn’t really in session. His own introversion prevents himfrom really observing the pc’s tone or reaction.All these faults can be cured and HAVE to be before an Auditor can call himself areal Auditor. Short of that he is just a fooling-about dilettante. And he has “failed pcs”.It takes hard sweating work to get good enough to be a real Auditor. It takeshours and hours and hours of TRs the hard way. It takes a high degree of honesty thatincludes never faking and going by misunderstoods in his materials, always beinghonest in his auditing reports, constant practice with his metering, drills with the tonescale and a large degree of self-discipline.It isn’t “talent” that makes the good Auditor. It is practice and more practice untilhe himself knows first that he didn’t know and then knows that he really knows.The source of out tech is only laziness and dishonesty. Someone who is afraid ofwork thinks he can PR the C/S and the pc, fumble his way through and succeed out offakery. That route is failure. And it ends in “failed cases”. Don’t be a psychologist orpsychiatrist. That was their route.In the hands of a thoroughly trained and drilled Auditor, Scientology works andworks splendidly.There are no dog cases, no “ncgs”, no failed cases.But there are “Auditors” who don’t study and drill hard enough to become realAuditors. And there are C/Ses who don’t know their business and who don’t keep uptheir study and are too lazy to FES or read sessions or cram their Auditors.254"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"There are an awful lot of excellent Auditors and many very fine C/Ses. But insome local areas, where verbal tech gets going and ethics is out, the quality sags. Andthere you have ncgs and slow pcs and “failed cases”.Want to know how lazy your C/Ses and Auditors are? How many ncgs and failedcases do you have around? If you have any at all, tech in your area is out.A C/S 53RJ taken to F/Ning list and a GF40X taken to an F/Ning list will cureany ncg or failed case.

One took up the biggest readfirst and then cleaned up all other reads.Time has gone on. The system of prepared lists has been expanded to include notonly pcs but students and staff.It may have gone overlooked that such lists now include anything that couldhappen to a pc or student. In other words, prepared lists have become very thorough.WHO CAN USEThe only reason ever found for prepared lists not working was an auditor’s weakTR 1 and inability to read a meter.Even this difficulty has been handled by “Qual Okay to Audit” Checksheets.Before an auditor should be let near a prepared list he should be put through atleast six “Okay to Audit” short Checksheets in Qual.Qual is not fast flow. Things done in Qual are Method 4 Word Cleared andstarrated, with all demos and drills. Only if this is done can you have some certaintythat a prepared list will read on the pc and that the pc or student will get handled.These Qual “Okay to Audit” Checksheets are done AFTER a student has beentrained and classed as an auditor.

And he must see to itthat his auditors are trained via the above checklists. Otherwise the lists just won’t readand the C/S, the pc and the org are left up the creek!LOTS of “lists that didn’t read” are found in folders. I used to make a practice ofjust having them nulled again by an auditor whose metering and TRs were good andTHEY READ AND THE CASE RESOLVED.PC LISTS1. HCO BULLETIN 24 NOVEMBER 1973RB, C/S SERIES 53RJ” SHORT HI-LO TA ASSESSMENT C/S.” This is a famous list. It solved the long long problem ofhigh and low TAs and really solved it. Unfortunately it has a name of being done forhigh and low TAs. In truth it practically handles the whole repair of any difficult casetoday! One assesses it Method 5. One handles the reads from the top down. It can alsobe reassessed several times until it F/Ns on a whole M5 assessment. It is quiteremarkable what it will do for a case that has been running badly or is bogged, quite inaddition to handling high and low TAs!2. HCO BULLETIN 1 JANUARY 1972RA, “LIX HI-LO TA REVISED.” This isthe same list as C/S 53RJ above. It has been brought up to date. It gives the wholequestion for each subject as in C/S 53RJ and the same handling. It is easier to use on apc whose attention wanders or who is not very familiar with terms.3. HCO BULLETIN 29 OCTOBER 1971R, “INT RUNDOWN CORRECTIONLIST REVISED.” As Interiorization-Exteriorization problems (when they exist) have tobe handled before any other thing is handled, an auditor sometimes assesses another listand then finds himself doing this list, “Int” appears on many other lists and when itreads one does this list. One has to go back and complete the original list of course.“Int” problems cause high TA, headaches and general upset. I’ve begun to think afterseeing a lot of headache cases that maybe only Int-Ext problems cause headaches!Instead of repairing Int, sometimes auditors will run it again and again. Also Int can goflat to Cog VVGIs on an early flow, even a recall flow. Then if one insists on finishingthe Int RD, one has trouble and I mean trouble. So this is a valuable list.257"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"4. HCO BULLETIN 15 DECEMBER 1968R, “L4BR” “FOR ASSESSMENT OFALL LISTING ERRORS.” An out list (meaning one done by Listing and Nulling, nota prepared list) can raise more concentrated hell with a pc than any other single auditingerror. The amount of misemotion or illness which a wrong list generates has to be seento be believed.

HCO BULLETIN 29 FEBRUARY 1972R, “FALSE TA CHECKLIST.” Thiswas a very important discovery about TAs. One uses this when another list indicates aFalse TA or one is suspected. Auditors have been known to get so desperate about apc’s TA that they falsified worksheets. This (and C/S 53RJ) make that totally needless.I’ve seen this change a case from despair to VVVVGIs!9.

HCO BULLETIN 30 JUNE 1971R, “EXPANDED GF 40RB.” Called “GF40X” This is the “7 resistive type cases” at the end of the Green Form expanded out.This is how you get those “earlier practices” and other case stoppers. This done wellgives a lot of extensive work in Dianetics. It’s lengthy but really pays off.If you were to do a C/S 53RJ Method 5, all handled, and to an F/Ning list and then doa GF 40XRB, all handled, reassessed to an F/Ning list you would ‘‘crack’’ most casesto a point where they ran well.12.BOARD TECHNICAL BULLETIN 28 MAY 1974R, “FULL ASSISTCHECKLIST FOR INJURY AND ILLNESS.” While you don’t put the pc on the cansfor this one, you mark it as to the state the pc is in and it says what you do for illnessand injury. This one, done correctly, is how the minister runs the medico out ofbusiness.STUDENT LISTS13.

All the words on a list are cleared on a pc without repeating the sameword or asking the list question.

Chief amongst them isomission of vital data in the report. Another is faking the things run or the pc’s actionsor reactions.To the person doing this it may seem that he has covered up his incompetence butin actual fact it is eventually detected.A twice declared person recently messed up the cases of several VIPs by simplyomitting some of their disagreements with what was being done.Three SPs, now declared, some years ago had a mutual understanding that theywould not put down each other’s withholds. These three also falsified auditing reportsto the effect that they had run certain things on pcs “and there was nothing on them,”when in fact they either had not run them or there was reaction which they did not putinto the report. They messed up about a dozen people before they were caught and ittook many, many hours of careful C/Sing and auditing to salvage those cases (and italso took about two years). They made several hundred serious enemies for themselvesand today I doubt any Scientologist would even speak to them and their names areremembered with scathing contempt.It is not only easy to detect a falsified auditing report, it is also inevitable that itwill be detected.The person whose auditing reports have been falsified is easy to spot in foldersand records. The auditor marks “VGIs, F/N” and the examiner notes by-passed chargeand Bad Indicators. An auditor seeking to prevent this being detected has been knownto take the examiner report from the folder but that there is no examiner report would bethe first thing a C/S would notice. Examiner reports have been forged and exchangedwith the actual one but this too is very visible.261"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Lack of a proper success story points directly to out tech and if it is not visible inthe folder then that folder contains falsified auditing reports.The pc in the midst of his auditing, refuses to re-sign for more. An inspection offolder either finds the out tech in the auditing reports or it doesn’t. If the Folder ErrorSummary finds no out tech, the next thing that is looked for is falsified auditing reportsand this is extended to looking at the other cases this auditor has handled to see if thereis any similarity of reaction.A D of P interview with the pc will reveal falsified auditing reports. It will containdata that does not appear in the auditing reports. The first thing suspect is the auditingreports.Basically, correct tech applied by a competent auditor who has been trained andinterned, works and works every time. When it “doesn’t work,” a C/S begins to lookfor the real scene. There are many ways he can ascertain the actual scene. Amongstthese are outside-the-door session taping, monitors, interviews, lack of success stories,failures to declare, failures to re-sign, examiner reports at variance with the sessionreports, personal check up into the case and many others.The only thing which temporarily misleads a C/S is a falsified auditing report. Butin all our experience with these, the detection of such reports is inevitable even if itoccurs a long time afterwards.The person who would falsify an auditing report is usually found to be asuppressive with abundant R/Ses and evil intentions who never should have beentrained in the first place.Therefore, the penalty for knowingly falsifying an auditing report in order tomake oneself seem more competent than one is or to hide departures from the C/S or toomit vital data necessary to C/Sing, resulting in upsets to a case and time spent ininvestigation by seniors, is actionable by a Committee of Evidence and if the matter isproven beyond reasonable doubt, a cancellation of all certificates and awards, a declareand an expulsion order are mandatory.Should the person perpetrating the falsification of auditing reports run away(blow) before action can be taken, the result is the same and is enforceable even if theperson is not present.A green auditor may look upon the offense as slight. If he is too untrained torealize that proper application of tech works every time and that improper application isa gross overt act, he may not realize the seriousness of his action. This however cannotbe pleaded as a defense. It is not a light thing to end the hopes and close the door on apc just because one is trying to cover up his blunders. The blundering auditor can berepaired by cramming and retraining. But only if it is known how he has blundered.That in itself is nowhere near as serious as hiding the fact.Honesty is the road to truth.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:lfCopyright © 1976by L.

Loss of folders entirely is a muchgreater catastrophe.While cases and even folders can be reconstructed and eventually handled (atenormous trouble and time to the pc and technical people) this does not minimize theoffense.Usually Folder Pages are regarded too lightly as a post and are subject to muchtransfer even when posted. The Director of Tech Services is often far too lax in postinga Folder Archives I/C even as a double hat. Space restrictions often impede the carefulpreservation of folders in orgs. But all these posts and spaces are vital to a smoothdelivery of auditing and should not be lightly looked upon.The commonest (and most senseless) omissions from folders are:1. WORD CLEARING WORKSHEETS. These are done in Academies ortraining or Interne areas as well as the HGC and it is often an omitted action to forwardthem to the person’s pc folder. Often the lines to do so are unknown or completelymissing. Yet every metered word clearing action should not only be the subject of aworksheet but also must be included in the person’s pc folder in date order. Wordclearer can fail to F/N a chain or even fail to clear a word as a chain when it doesn’tF/N. Such goofs can mess up cases and leave a C/S perplexed as to how the pc wasrunning well one day and badly the next—yet there is no word clearing worksheetthere, so the fact of ANOTHER AUDITOR on the case is hidden.2. QUAL WHY FINDING ACTIONS. As why finding also includes listing,possibly the most vicious omission is the failure to include Why Finding worksheets inthe person’s folder or even do a worksheet on it. Yet at least one org has beentemporarily wrecked by indiscriminate “why finding” in Qual that resulted in wrongitems and wrong lists and messed up the cases of whole staffs. This poor why findinghas led at times to why finding becoming a restricted or forbidden practice. Qualworksheets of why finding MUST be included in the person’s folder along with anylist made which itself must include the question asked.3. HCO WHY FINDING. These actions must also be the subject ofworksheets and must also be included in the person’s folder.263"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"4. ALL SEC CHECKS AND INTEGRITY PROCESS LISTS ANDACTIONS. It doesn’t matter who or what is doing the sec check, the resulting action isNOT the property of the department or branch or person doing the sec checking.

INSTRUCTIONSAn index is an arranged analysis of the contents of a book or set of books for thepurpose of detailed reference.In the Technical Bulletins of Dianetics and Scientology, several methods oflocating desired material are available.CONTENTSEach volume has at the front a Contents which lists in chronological order eachissue in that volume. It is used where you know the date or approximate date of anissue.PERIODICALS BY ISSUE NUMBERFollowing the Contents in Volumes I, II, III, IV and VI, there is a list ofPeriodicals by Issue Number. Use it to look up an issue when you know its type andissue number.LONG CONTENTSAt the front of each volume, following the Contents, and list of Periodicals byIssue Number, there is a Long Contents. This is a more detailed contents listing, alsoarranged in chronological order, which lists the series number where applicable, thedate, the title, pertinent sub-headings and the major subjects of each issue in the orderin which they appear. It can be used to quickly locate major subjects covered in aparticular time period.SUBJECT INDEXThe Subject Index is at the back of each volume immediately following the textpages. It is arranged alphabetically with references under headings the reader is likely toseek. It is used when you know the approximate year (which volume) of the data youare seeking.ALPHABETICAL LIST OF TITLESFollowing the Subject Index, there is an Alphabetical List of Titles for issuescontained in that volume. This is a fast way to find the issue you are seeking when youknow the title or approximate title.CHRONOLOGICAL TAPE LISTAlthough it is not immediately apparent, there is also a Chronological Tape Listcontained in these volumes. To use it just look up the chronological volumes (first eightvolumes) at or near the date you are seeking and you will find lectures given by LRH atthe time. You can also often find tape lectures covering subjects you are interested in bylooking up one of the other reference lists, locating key issues on the subject, then byturning to these in the text pages, locate tapes given on that subject, as, particularly inthe SHSBC period, bulletins were issued which summarized data found more fully ontapes of same or similar date.CUMULATIVE INDEXThe Cumulative Index will be found at the back of Volume X, the C/S SeriesVolume, following the Subject Index. It is basically an alphabetical integration of theten subject indexes.296"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"PurposeThe purpose of the Cumulative Index (and of its sub-indexes in each volume) isto indicate the location of specific data about a chosen subject, to lead one to furtherdata about a subject (data which might be unknown and thus not looked for), to cross-reference related subjects, to clarify the use of terms and abbreviations by making themeasily locatable in their context, to give definitions and references to definitions ofterms, and to make it possible to do an embracive study of a subject, using the index asa guide through the collected technical writings of L. Ron Hubbard.Alphabetical OrderThe alphabetical order takes account of each letter in turn through the full entryeven if it consists of several words. Thus process levels comes after processing check.Definitions are placed in chronological order under the main heading and beforethe alphabetized sub-entries.Numerals (entries beginning with a figure) are placed after the alphabet. Thus 8C,37R Rundown, etc., are found after the letter Z.Symbols (\"/\", \"X\", etc.) are put after the numerals.Arrangement of EntriesThe word or phrase one first looks up is the main entry. If there is a section ofentries (usually two or more) that would have the same main entry or relate to the samemain entry then the section is indented so the main entry stands out.e.g. certificates,auditor, purpose of, I-400cancellation of auditor's certificates, reason for,IV-30, 96provisional certificates, I-52requirements for permanent certificates, I-65restoration of certificates IV-34suspension, line for, I-66why all begin with the word \"Hubbard\", III-288The page reference is given in the form volume-page number, thus I-400 meanspage 400 in Volume I.The main entry may have a sub-entry that has further sub-entries. These areindented further to let the sub-entry stand out.e.g. Learn(ing),by observing or experiencing, I-190isn't memorizing, III-424lag and process lag, III-I 8process, discipline of imagination essential, I-324rate, III-17, 20defn, the rate one will permit ideas to inflow,III-28aberration and learning rate, relationship bet-ween, III-15consequences, III-20dissemination, use of \"learning rate\" in, III-20, 21governs reading time, III-22increasing ~ rate by drill usually only increasesfamiliarity and automaticity, III-22learning lag and learning rate, III-I9, 20through rnimicry, I-31willingness to, III-79297"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"The sign ~, called a swung dash, used particularly in the individual volumesubject indexes to save space, indicates that the main entry is understood to be read atthat point.Cross ReferencesIn addition to data being referenced under one main heading and then the samedata being referenced under alternative headings, there are two other forms ofcrossreferencing. These are:The see reference which is used when the information is provided under anotherheading elsewhere in the index.The see also reference which leads the reader to material on closely relatedsubjects, or to other sources for material on the subject.LRH Books of the period are also referred to in cross references (forabbreviations of titles used see the Technical Dictionary ).ChronologyAs the first eight volumes are arranged chronologically, the volume-page numbercode serves as a guide to the time period of the references, the lowest volume-lowestpage number being the earliest material.A square bracket with a year, e.g. [1955], following an entry indicates that thedata is from that year. This is used where it was necessary to more clearly indicate thetime period of the reference.The chronology of the material is important as it shows both the evolution of thesubject, and, where there is any conflict, the later material supersedes the earlier.--------------These volumes make \"Having the correct technology\" easy.\"Knowing the technology\" should be greatly assisted by the index.Thus there should be no stops to the first two points of Keeping ScientologyWorking.These technical volumes together with the third dynamic technology contained inthe Organization Executive Course books provide the tools with which to reach thegoals of Scientology, and so \"give to earth a culture of which we can be proud\".298"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"299"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"CUMULATIVE INDEX300"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"CUMULATIVE INDEX1950 -1975aberration(s), aberrative, aberrate (cont.)
