CourseCONFIDENTIAL Students CLEAR AND O.T.DEFINITION OF A CLEAR: A THETAN WHO CAN BE AT CAUSE KNOWINGLY ANDAT WILL OVER MENTAL MATTER, ENERGY, SPACE AND TIME.In clearing you move the Being up to where he is cause over mental MEST. A Clear has erasedthe matter, energy, space and time connected to the thing called MIND. He has been cleared of theMASS, PICTURES etc. It is a negative gain.Clear occurs when he stops mocking up bank, or realizes he is doing it.A Clear has perhaps not entirely lost the automaticity of mocking up mass. But at least heknows he is putting it there and practice increases his general reality.A Clear may, at first, have a little trouble with thought. His “think” is quite powerful, and isnot influenced by a bank, but may be influenced by his own past postulates. Thus he may run intodifficulty with his own postulates in present time, his own past postulates and others present timepostulates, especially when he has two or more postulates or similar magnitude opposing each other.At first his postulates will contain force, probably, and he may experience pain from these as a thetan.A Clear will have considerable influence upon others around him. People whose ability toconfront is not very high will begin to fall to pieces in the presence of a Clear. One mechanism ofthis is that the Clear tends to raise the people around him to a slightly higher level of confront, andthey begin to confront their own mind, and this really shakes them up. This is particularly so of anS.P. who dares not look at his mind, because he knows that if he does he will go insane.The E-Meter will read on a Clear on THOUGHT. It will read on postulate and assert. TheClear’s “think” influences the body, thus causing the meter to read.DEFINITION OF AN OPERATING THETAN: A THETAN WHO CAN BE AT CAUSEKNOWINGLY AND AT WILL OVER THOUGHT, LIFE, MATTER, ENERGY, SPACEAND TIME, SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE.After Clear, we are starting to move into “ Cause over thought and life”.In PART ONE of the O.T. Course the Clear uses the same materials as are used on the ClearingCourse, and runs any banks he did not complete before he went Clear. This activity is in the realmof thought. But it is these banks which brought the being down the “dwindling spiral” and we mustbe sure that they are never again going to have any effect on the Being. There are also positive gainsto be had from this activity. The being is becoming more at cause over thought. He is on his wayto Operating Thetan.When a Clear moves up to cause over his own and other thought, life, Matter, Energy, Spaceand Time, he is an Operating Thetan.The width between wog and Clear is very great. The width between Clear and OT is a bit wider.LRH:fhL. Ron HubbardCopyright © 1966by L.

Well done and congratulations.This state has not previously been attained in this universe and we must all work towards gettingmore people - many more people - up to this level. Essentially, you are clear on the 1st dynamic and stillhave a lot of work in front of you to attain OT, which is to say the remaining dynamics, but neverthelessyou will find you have many abilities hitherto undreamed of. An ethical code already exists for OT’s soat the state of Clear one should not assume one has a license to do just whatever one will. You still havethe remaining dynamics to go so don’t use the abilities you have attained already to enslave others, or,indeed yourself.With freedom comes responsibility and with responsibility comes the need to assess one’s actionsand to take only such actions as will do the greatest good over the greatest number of dynamics. So, thePolicies of Scientology which have enabled you to reach the state of Clear still apply to all Clears. In factthey apply more because you have the reality of their value and the necessity of seeing that they arefollowed.Those who have not yet attained Clear will be watching you with some awe, so you have the dutyof setting an example of exemplary behavior in all aspects of your life. As a Clear you have no privilegesbeyond being declared Clear.As a result, bigger responsibilities will be given and expected of you so you must be prepared toresponsibly educate yourself where necessary so that you can do whatever is assigned to you in a propermanner in keeping with the main goals and aims of Scientology.So for you there is no sitting down and resting on your laurels, no waiving of policy, no promiscuous2nd dynamic activities, no improper assumption of power, control or influence or assuming that youautomatically know best in every situation. It is a crime to invalidate the State of Clear - see to it that youdon’t do this in your conduct as a Clear, particularly as regards yourself. You still have the rest of yourdynamics to go.You have now become more than ever a part of a team. Obsessive individualism and a failure toorganise were responsible for getting into the state we got into.As soon as you have gone the rest of the way this will become abundantly plain.I expect and need your help to carry out the broad mission of de-contaminating this area of theuniverse. If you wish to help, your first duty is to protect the repute of the state of Clear by exemplaryconduct. Your second duty is to attain OT as soon as possible. Your third, if you wish to help, is to becomepart of the endeavour to clean up this sector of the universe and make it safe not only for ourselves but thebillions of others who have been harmed.As a Clear, you are welcomed and honoured. Don’t do anything that will wear out your welcomeor bring dishonour on yourself or upon other Clears.Thank you for what you have done so far.Thank you for what you will do in the future.I know I can count on you.LRH:lrhL.

It’sas simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised.The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results.” Troublespots occur only where there are “no results.” Attacks from governments or monopoliesoccur only where there are “no results” or “bad results.”Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured ifthe technology is applied.So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the Dof P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists ofOne:Having the correct technology.Two:Knowing the technology.Three:Knowing it is correct.Four:Teaching correctly the correct technology.Five:Applying the technology.Six:Seeing that the technology is correctly applied.Seven:Hammering out of existence incorrect technology.Eight:Knocking out incorrect applications.Nine:Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology.Ten:Closing the door on incorrect application.One above has been done.Two has been achieved by many.Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a propermanner and observing that it works that way.Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world.Five is consistently accomplished daily.Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently.Seven is done by a few but is a weak point."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38Eight is not worked on hard enough.Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright.Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity.Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in anyarea.The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Threeabove can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too-brighthave a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more theindividual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people makethem defend themselves against anything they confront good or bad and seek to make itwrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad.Thus we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight,Nine and Ten.In all the years I have been engaged in research, I have kept my comm lines wideopen for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of acentury has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestionsand data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and nonewere major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, wewent astray and I repented and eventually had to “eat crow.”On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions andwritings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the completedestruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So 1 know what a group of peoplewill do and how insane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology.” By actualrecord the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings willdream up bad technology to destroy good technology. As we could have gotten alongwithout suggestions, then, we had better steel ourselves to continue to do so now that wehave made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as “unpopular,” “egotistical” and“undemocratic.” It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don’t see thatpopular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but pushhim further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnega-tion has filled the Southeast Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracyhas given us inflation and income tax.Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had notsupported me in many ways, I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that ifin its formative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safelyassume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now thatit is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or coordination of what has beendone, which will be valuable—only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles andsuccessful applications.The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technologywere help in the form of friendship, of defense, of organization, of dissemination, ofapplication, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were,and are, appreciated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39Discovery contribution was not however part of the broad picture.We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank.We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact—-the group left to its own deviceswould not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatizations of the bank called “newideas” would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never beforeevolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he didevolve—psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment,etc., ad infinitum.So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and goodsense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above areruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it andwe will perish.So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, Ihave not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’snot good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this.Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed, thewhole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J.; Wichita; the early organi-zations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine andTen. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. Butahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons.The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without bankshave different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then onlyon bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas areindividual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must riseabove an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done.The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell—and if you were looking forHell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has beenthe lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means offrying every man, woman and child on the planet. That is bank. That is the result ofCollective Thought Agreement.The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideasthat have somehow gotten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves areattacked by “public opinion” media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet thanourselves.Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a groupof freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, thatis destructive.When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for thebank-dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology andswear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to anydestructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application.It’s the bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the bank thatsays we must fail."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40So just don’t play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock outof your road all the future thorns.Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of apc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on PreclearC. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak onThree above and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A toldthe Case Supervisor, “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly ateach of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor.It opens the door to the introduction of “new technology” and to failure.What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s allthat happened. This is what he should have done: Grabbed the Auditor’s Report andlooked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so, she found what the CaseSupervisor and the rest missed: That Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TAdivisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Q’d and A’d with a cognitionand abandoned Process X while it still gave high TA and went off running one of AuditorB’s own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examinationturned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you mustnever invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be “too busywith admin to have any time for actual cases.”All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven,Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That process X didn’twork.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s yourAuditor’s Report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA whenyou stopped Process X. What did you do?” Then the pc wouldn’t have come close to aspin and all four of these would have retained their certainty.In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct processrecommended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one had(a) increased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported asunworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended,correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked!Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every timeinstruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in theauditor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nineand Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases.Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “becausehe gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisionsa session are reported. “Of course his Model Session is poor but it’s just a knack he has”is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobodyat Levels O to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was nevertaught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter andit was not discovered that he “overcompensated” nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at “set.” So everyone was aboutto throw away standard processes and Model Session because this one student “got suchremarkable TA.” They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never lookedat this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impededby a rough Model Session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41(actual Scientology) was hidden under a lot of departures and errors.I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lotof offbeat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students werein a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought undercontrol, and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Tenso they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straight-ened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, toughinstructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl.BUT no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased.Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comesabout from noncomprehension. Usually the noncomprehension is not of Scientology butsome earlier contact with an offbeat humanoid practice which in its turn was notunderstood.When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can becounted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came fromorgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Underinstruction in Scientology, they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples ofprinciples. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it couldnot be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or wouldduplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failuresof instruction earlier. So proper instruction is vital. The D of T and his instructors and allScientology instructors must be merciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten intoeffective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of nouse to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody wasinterested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him.With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properlytrained. As an instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn thesluggards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleevesrolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individualstudent, never on a whole class only. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fastaction to correct it. Don’t wait until next week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him.If you can’t graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining,graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll have nightmares if they contemplatesquirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they’ll knowbetter than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing.When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of theuniverse—never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit, let themquit fast. If they enrolled, they’re aboard; and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the sameterms as the rest of us—win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded aboutbeing Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicatedorganizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever madeanything. It’s a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigerssurvive—and even they have a hard time. We’ll survive because we are tough and arededicated. When we do instruct somebody properly, he becomes more and more tiger.When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don’tmake students into good Scientologists and that lets everybody down. When Mrs.Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed,"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humor her and we all die a little. Theproper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist. Now we’re goingto make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you deadthan incapable.”Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you seethe cross we have to bear.But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get, the more economics andtime we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from gettingthat big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow.Fast. And as we grow, our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten willmake us grow less.So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s ourpossible failure to retain and practice our technology.An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of“unworkability.” They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was doneor not done.If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of allthe rest.We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to dofor lack of something better.The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, andyour own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here andnow with and in Scientology.This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we maynever again have another chance.Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of thepast.

This is known as the basic on the “chain”. A number of similar things,early to late in different points of time make a chain.When you have the earliest erased, the rest erases easily. However, when the earliestone is erased the next to last is the new “basic” and must be erased in it’s turn. And so on.As this goes on, the items of the chain eventually begin to “blow” (erase) very easily.Therefore, if Items cease to erase easily, you have not properly handled the Item justbefore it. And may not have handled the same item in the earlier run.Even if you get reads out of a later run than the one you are supposed to be in, youwill find the later one still reads when you get to it properly and will then erase nicely.The real sneaker in the R6 bank is “the person himself at the time”. This we call “thethetan” in the Item. Each Item has an impression of the being as he was at the moment ofthe item long ago. If one does not spot this each time, it will not erase and mass builds upas we go along. This means look at or locate yourself as a thetan at the time of the incident.It is not the light. It is right where you are in the auditing chair, but of course, ages past.Spot means “glance at”. q = Greek letter theta. qn is a trick way of saying theta-n. If, asyou read this, you can glance at the wall, you can spot. It reads well.One then has to get the earliest moment of one’s own beingness in the bank and“spot” it.Then one has to spot it for each Item one runs.One “spots the thetan” and the Item or (in the Objects) the Items, at the same time.This is a bit of a trick. It is “simultaneous spotting”. Spotting the thetan in a called (verbal)Item can be done at the same time as the Item is called.Ordinarily, one calls or spots the Item a few times and then also calls and spots thethetan.The thetan can also then be spotted without calling or spotting the item.The right way is the way you get the most reads.Soon one begins to be expert at it, but then one must be expert at it with Item 1, Part1, Run 1 or it builds up.One had a tiny bit of mass on him right at the start, as he was protesting. This is(slight as it is) enough to tie down the chain by leaving it with a basic. So “spot the thetan”each time. Spotting the environment at the time is also possible."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48DURATION OF AUDITINGFind a quiet place in which to audit. Audit an hour or two at a time, preferable thesame time each day. A day you don’t audit is a session lost. Trying to make up a sessionis useless. Audit daily. When you don’t you lose sessions. It isn’t how much you get donein a session, it’s the getting on, bit by bit, that counts. It’s like digging a long ditch. Whatyou don’t dig isn’t dug.The bank contains less than was first thought but it contains enough. In three or fourmonths you will have make it if you do a good job on each Item. And don’t fool about withthe bank. It goes into restimulation if you stir it up.And don’t decide a lot of things. Your ability to postulate is increasing and you candecide a run is “flat” or doesn’t need to be run and have it behave that way. But it will stillbe there to knock you down.THE CAUSE OF TROUBLEThe only way one can get ill, or in trouble, is not auditing, in trying to “correct” theItems given, or, in not following instructions.What doesn’t make Items read properly:Loud shouting.Body movement while calling.Fiddling the one-hand electrode.Tensing muscles.Getting angry with the lack of a read.Gritting teeth.Auditing past an ARC break.Doing a List 7 every time you don’t get a read or feel odd.What makes Items read properly:Doing regular sessions.Not self auditing out of session.Staying calm.Keeping calm.Keeping the Auditor’s Code on the pc (you).Following directions exactly.Adding nothing.Finding ARC breaks (when they happen) with a List 7. ( List 7 run as an assessment for ARC Break will run easily. Locate andindicate the by-passed charge as it shows up. If you are not a classedauditor, get this done in a Qual Division that has a classed auditoreither on or through the Clearing Course. If you really bog down,Auditing by List 7 will give you the relief sought.)Auditing in a place you feel secure and where you won’t be disturbed.Audit daily.Not auditing too long at one time, 1 to 2 hours is optimum, closer to 1 than2.Not trying to get rid of it all at once.Considering it a routine piece of ditch digging.Not expecting to fly suddenly.Not dwelling on your case out of session."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49When you end a session, end it.Being plodding and methodical.Just getting on with it, getting all the reads off by calling or spotting, goingon to the next item, if it doesn’t read, get more off last item and returnto the one that wouldn’t read.Getting in the buttons Supp., Inval., Protest, when needed only.Checking for earlier or later runs only when in trouble.Only handle trouble when it arrives.Don’t try to handle it before it does.The best way to stay out of trouble is READ, STUDY AND UNDERSTANDTHESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE BEGINNING.BASIC BASICThe first (earliest) bit in the bank is not an Item but a light.It appears to the left front of the face, some distance away (look ahead and to theleft a bit and you’ll spot it).It is the source of unconsciousness and produces it when contacted.There is a light before each Run, in the middle of each 7’s GPM (every 4 pairs), atthe start of Basic End Words, at the start of Confusion GPM, and at the start of the Objectsand at the end of each type of Item in the Objects (every 8 Items). Each time you feelgroggy, it’s a light doing it. Each major change, then, is preceded by the light. Mark thesein on your platens if they are not there. Flatten each one by spotting it, and it and thetan.Anaten (unconsciousness) can be spotted away.It is part of the light. When the light went on, the thetan went anaten. Instead of aSolo Auditor going anaten in his session, it is only necessary to spot the anaten in thethetan when running the light.When you spot a light or object or combination of objects, you should get a read onthe needle. By spotting the same thing again, you get another read. By spotting it again,you get another read. And so you continue to spot it, time after time, until no more readsoccur by reason of spotting.You repeat verbal items aloud, getting a read each time you repeat until it has nomore reads. Verbal items are found in the “7’s”. “Basic End Words” and “ConfusionGPM”.But you silently spot lights, objects, combinations of objects repeatedly (same one)until you have no more reads.You should get as many falls, etc. from spotting a light as you do from calling anItem.Spotting the thetan follows the same rules. You spot repeatedly until there are nomore reads on the needle by reason of spotting the thetan (self) at that instant and place.You don’t have to see the light to spot it or see the thetan or see the object or objects.You only need to spot the place where they are with the idea of what should be there.Of course, seen at first or not, continued spotting makes it blow."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50PATTERN OF THE BANKThe apparent pattern of the bank is as follows:There are five PARTS. These occur in a row. This row of 5 parts is called a RUN.The first, earliest, of these is the “7’s”.The second, just above the “7’s” is the Basic End Words.The third, just above the Basic End Words, is the Confusion GPM.The fourth, just above the Confusion GPM, is the Objects - hollow.The fifth, just above the Objects - hollow is the Objects - solid.After a RUN of A, B, C, D, and E we begin again with the “7’s” for the next RUN.The parts go as they do in the first RUN. (“7’s”, then Basic End Words, then ConfusionGPM, then the Objects - hollow, then the Objects - solid.)Therefore, the trick is always to run only the earliest run available and not get intolater runs.The bank has 10 runs or 50 parts.None of these use a GPM Line Plot.They only contain what is given on the platen you are issued.The proper way to run it all is to get on with it. After 10 runs, you may have to gofrom Run 1 to Run 10 all over again anyway, to get any final bits. So your first runningof the whole 10 runs may not be your final run."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51HOW TO USE A PLATENEach student must supply himself with foolscap paper.The platen is then laid aside the foolscap paper and you repeat the number on theactual foolscap paper. Across the top of the foolscap paper is written the student’s name,the name of the part being run, the number of the run, and the date.The reads on the Items are written on the foolscap paper alongside the number ofthe Item.To keep from cramping your reads and have enough paper on all parts, just takelegal (foolscap) size paper and use the items consecutively numbers and go down the pageas far as necessary to record all reads, then leave a space and write the next number. It istoo hard to keep the numbers even on the platen and worksheet.Number work sheet by page number of platen + consecutive letter.Page 1 of platen becomes Page 1A + B + C of worksheet.Label each worksheet well.In order to save paper bulk, continue down your piece of foolscap paper fromsession to session, dating each new session start."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52Use both sides of your foolscap paper, but use separate Auditor Reports for eachsession, of course.Any comments that need to be written down must be put on another sheet of paper.Only the actual reads, including any buttons that are used, and any cognition’s, should bewritten on your foolscap paper. Do not write the name of the items, only the pair numberand item number.Leave some space on your foolscap paper when you complete an item, so that if thenext item does not read, you then have sufficient space to go back and add more in ifnecessary to the previous item.Do not write anything on the platen.When you return your auditor’s reports and worksheets always use paper clips.Never use a stapler on this course.RUNNING ITEMSAlways run the earliest Item first, flatten it and go on to next item. Complete the part.Go to first Item in next part, etc.One calls the Item and marks it’s reads until one no longer gets reads. Then one callsthe next Item and marks it’s reads, until it no longer reads. Then one can call the first itemof the pair again and second Item, calling them as a pair until they no longer read. Thereads obtained on an item by calling a pair are put under the appropriate item number. Allthe reads for any one item are recorded in the same place on the worksheet regardless ofwhen the item is called. (Such as calling as a pair or in rerunning). Space should be leftafter each item so that reads can be added when calling the pair or in the case of havingto go back and get more charge off an item.Whenever you move the Tone Arm down mark on your worksheet (BD —) and putthe new T.A. position in the Blank Space, e.g. (B.D. 3.0).If an item does not read the moment it is called, then you have left the Item justbefore it charged. So call the earlier Item again and get the read or reads off it, making sureyou don’t go into a later run. Then call the item that didn’t read the first time and you willfind it instantly reads.When you leave an item to go back to a previous one, put a / on the item you leaveand a - at the item you go back to. If you go back more than one item, put a / for as manyitems as you go back. i.e. if you go back three items, you put /// on the item left and - oneach item gone back over. Each item must be called in turn up to the place where you wentback from.NOTE: This can easily be overdone (getting all reads off earlier items) as you can putyourself into later runs, so moderation in this goes a long way.But never ignore the fact that a new item didn’t read the first time it was called. Italways means you didn’t get all reads off the Item immediately before, or that you failedto spot the thetan at the moment. NEVER go past a non-reading item.When running Clearing Course material, you find you get a certain amount of readson an Item (correct ‘run’ type reads are Fs, LFs, sBDs, BDs) then the following Item inthe same session will get approximately the same amount of reads - if not and you get onlya few reads, then go back to the previous Item that read well and you will find there is morecharge on it.

Items read big and many times.You may get as many as 25 or more large reads on every Item. The main thing is to clear(get all the charge off) each Item for the run you are in. Be sure to keep in the correct run.Remember, if you get bored with so many reads to take the boredom off as a button. Youcan just throw away reads because you get tired of seeing it read. Your purpose is to cleaneach Item, not make yourself interested or happy or entertained. A lot of it is just hard,slogging work.

By illness is meant,“colds”, “flu”, “dysentery”, etc.To prevent becoming ill, be very careful of your place, very careful to pick up whereyou left off, very careful not to skip.

He himself becomes clear. He has separated out - cleared out andaway from certain other complexities. It does not mean that he is without bank. But hewill find that his recognition of the first dynamic has improved enormously.The state of clear is terrific. We have waited on this state for a very long time. Whenan individual goes clear, he goes over a bump. He goes high as clear and he wouldprobably remain clear till the end of time unless something else keyed in.So a clear, having moved and separated out from the material, must then get allavailable charge off the Section II O.T. materials.These must be run properly, using the same technical rules as on the ClearingCourse. They must not be skimped. Good tech calmly applied is the keynote of this.You are now moving along the road from clear to O.T. By the end of Section III,you will be very much in the realm of O.T. but only if you do these lower levels of O.T.properly.

Callhose A the force the pc has used to execute his goal. Call hose B the force otherdynamics have used to oppose that goal. Where these two forces have perpetu-ally met, a mental mass is created. This is the picture of any problem—forceopposing force with resultant mass, Where the pc’s goal meets constantopposition, you have in the reactive mind the resultant mass caused by the twoforces— GOAL = force of getting it done, OPPOSITION = force opposing itgetting done. This is the goal problem mass.2.The problem created by two or more opposing ideas which being opposed,balanced, and unresolved, make a mass. It’s a mental energy mass.IMPLANT GPM : ( IMPLANT GOALS PROBLEM MASS ) :An Implant GPM is a GPM made up of goals (and their opposing forces) whichare not the pc’s own but which have been “implanted” in him.An implant is an electronic means of overwhelming a thetan with a significance.An implanted goal is : a goal the thetan himself has not decided upon - but whichhas been induced in him by overwhelming force and persuasion.In the case of implanted Goals Problem Masses, use was made of the mechanicsof the actual pattern of living to impress and entrap a thetan and enforceobedience to behaviour patterns. The goal selected was not entirely based onany goal of the thetan but was an entirely arbitrary selection both as to goal andpattern, by those conducting the implanting.TERMINAL (also refered to as TERM ) :1.It would be any fixed mass utilized in a communication system. That, I"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60think, is the best of the various definitions that have come out for this. Any massused in a fixed position in any communications system. Thus you see a manwould be a terminal, but a post could also be a terminal.2.An item or identity the pc has actually been sometime in the past (or present) iscalled a terminal. It is “the pc’s own valence” at that time. In the goals problemmass (the black masses of the reactive mind) those identities which, whencontacted, produce pain, tell us at once that they are terminals. The person couldfeel pain only as himself (thetan plus body) and therefore identities he has beenproduce pain when its mental residues (black masses) are recontacted inprocessing.OPPOSITION TERMINAL (also referred to as OPPTERM) :1.An item or identity the pc has actually opposed ( fought, been an enemy of )sometime in the past ( or present ) is called an opposition terminal. As the personidentified himself as not it, he could experience from it only sensation. Anopposition terminal when its mental residues ( black masses ) are recontacted inprocessing, produces only sensation, never pain.Electrically, a terminal is one of the two poles between or through which currentflows.We got the idea of two different types of terminals in GPMs, because that’s theway they are. One, the pc thinks of as his own or himself. The other he thinksof as an opposition. Hence, we use “terminal” to mean what the pc thinks is hisidea and mass in the GPM, and we use “opposition terminal”, or “oppterm” forshort, to mean the mass and significance he thinks of as the enemy to the one heis in.Both the “terminal” and the “oppterm” in the GPM have mass and significanceand have the appearance of receiving and giving communication and so they arecalled terminals.ITEM :1.In GPMs, what we now also call items were first called terminals because theyinteracted with each other electrically. They were always in pairs.When one is speaking of either a Terminal or Opposition Terminal and isn’tbeing specific as to which it is ( Term or Oppterm ) one says ITEM.PAIR :1. A set of two; two that go together.DICHOTOMY :1.A dichotomy in Scientologese means plus and minus. A plus word and a minusword. They are of the same order of things always. A crude example would be“An Apple” and “Applelessness”. That’s a pair, a dichotomy.Plus and minus interchange a current as you will find on any battery. So we don’t"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61want active-passive. (For example, the active such as “Man” and the passivesuch as “Woman”.) We want the bold PLUS and MINUS, the opposites. Thenature of things is a major idea. Each major idea has two parts: a PLUS and aMINUS. These are opposed to each other. They interchange current. Theconflict. What is generally agreed to be the unwanted or poor side is minus.What is generally conceived to be all right is plus.For example, in a modern society we would have the major idea that anindividual has an ecconomic status. Wealth is the PLUS and Poverty is theMINUS.So a DICHOTOMY means to two parts of a major idea.2. Opposites : two things which when interplayed cause action.LINE PLOT :1. Each GPM has a Line Plot.A Line Plot is the pattern of items for every GPM. For example, each full goal,like To Grab Books, would have a Line Plot with items like “Grabbing Books”or just “Grabbed Books”, etc.END WORD :An End Word is the final word of a goal. It is always a noun or a condition madeinto a noun.For example, with a goal such as “To Grab Books”, Books is the end word.Each end word, however, has many verb or action words related to it, thusmaking up a series of goals. End words are called end words because they comeon the end of each of a series of goals.It is the end word that is the common denominator to the whole of a GPM.WHOLE TRACK :1.The Whole Track is the moment to moment record of a person’s existence in thisuniverse in pictures and impression form.CHAIN :1.A series of recordings of similar experiences. A chain has Engrams, Secondar-ies and locks.2. Incidents of similar nature strung out in time.3. A series of incidents of similar nature or subject matter.ENTITIES :"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62The basic definition of “entity” as contained in standard dictionaries is :Something that has a real and separate existence either actually or in the mind;a being or existence which is considered distinct and self contained.There are various types of entities described in the full works on Dianetics andScientology.For example, a cell is a living animal all by itself.There is the Genetic Entity (“GE”) which is the entity which carries forewardfrom the earliest formation of the MEST body.There can be injected entities or sythetic entities. Some of these are ridges onwhich facsimilies are planted. Each one of those things can be a thinking entity.It thinks it is alive. It can think it’s a being, as long as energy is fed to it.These follow all the rules and laws and phenomena of single beings.The full subject of entities is not taken up in this glossary. However, for anunderstanding of the data on entities as contain in Dianetic and Scientologymaterials, one must first have a good understanding of the basic definitionsgiven above.References in Dianetic and Scientology materials for further data on entitiesinclude :HCOB 30 JUL 80, THE NATURE OF A BEINGDIANETICS, THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH, Book Two, Chapter IV.THE HISTORY OF MAN, Chapters Two, Five and Ten.SET ( also “RUN” ) : 1.On OT II a “set” or “run” refers to one complete set of 21 GPMs, which are alsorefered to as a Whole Track Table.PART :1.The term “part” refers to the individual GPMs which, in their written form, arecalled Chapters. Where the chapter is split up into two or more separate sections,each of these would also be refered to as a part.L.

Affinity, Reality, Communication and Under-standing; the time track; mental image pictures; the earlier incident holding the later inplace; responses to Matter, Energy, Space, Time, Form as well as force; and the axloms.On this you can rest assured. And one might even wonder why we need all the additionalbulletins and cautions and provisions and lectures.The fact of the matter is that when one addresses a person, a human being “in theflesh” one is not addressing a simple being.Possibly an example will illustrate this: I had just finished giving a Congress and astaff member had made some appointments for me to see people who wanted to talk tome. And, in a conference room, I was suddenly confronted by a woman who wasdemonstrably and actively insane. She was incoherent, she was being “pursued”, she wasutterly agitated. Well, I was not then and never was in the business of treating the insane.Yet here was a situation which had to be handled if only to maintain social calm. In thosedays there were many techniques for exteriorizing people and so I used one of them,putting her back of her head. Promptly she went sane, calmly reviewed her problem withher husband, sensibly made up her mind what she was going to do to properly resolve thematter, thanked me and departed. For a brief time she had temporarily become a singleunit being.I have not given the example as a lesson in what to do in such cases forexteriorization techniques are not reliable. But only to illustrate the complexity of people.What you see as a human being, a person, is not a single unit being.In the first place, there is the matter of valence. A person can be himself or he canbe under the belief that he is another person or thing entirely. This removes him a step frombeing a simple being.Then there is the matter of being in a body. A body is a very complex contrivance,quite remarkable, quite complicated. And it is also quite subject to its own distortions.There are also the entities (as discussed in “Dianetics, The Modern Science of"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"67Mental Health”, pages 84-90, and also “The History Of Man”, pages 13-14, 43, 75-77). These follow all the rules and laws and phenomena of single beings.And then there is the matter of influences of other people around this human being.From a single, simple being there is a progressive complication setting in as oneadds all these other factors.The single, simple being, without any further associations can be out of valenceeven miles away from other contacts.It is the aggregate of all these factors which you address when you seek to guide orhandle the usual human being.This is also why objective processes are so effective - they get many of these factorsall going in the same direction for once.None of this is to say that it is impossible to handle all this. Far from it. But it doestell one why all the additional precautions (like don’t overrun, like careful sessionprocedures) are there in all those materials.But mainly it tells you that full recoveries seldom happen last and that cases requirean awful lot of work and often for a very long time.And like the woman at the Congress, one sometimes gets a sudden near-magicalresult. The trouble with that one was that she soon went back into her head and becameagain a composite, even though she now did have a sane plan of action to follow.Results, if you follow the rules and laws carefully and with good heart, can beobtained. And you, knowing your business, can obtain them.But don’t become discouraged if it all doesn’t happen fast and if it takes a long time.When you are handling a human being, you are handling a composite.We did not construct the human mind or human body. We did not put the universethere to involve, oppress or complicate life. We are working with the end product of anawful lot of trials and tribulations.If we were working with single beings, it would be a nothing to do. We are not. Weare working with a complexity and we can do an awful lot, far more than anyone coulddo before us. And our work with life has effects and influences far beyond our auditingtables. It took vast, vast numbers of years and eons for life to get that involved andcomplicated. Be glad that it doesn’t take even a tiny fraction of that to dig it out and smoothit out with Dianetics and Scientology.L. RON HUBBARDFOUNDERLRH: dm: kjmCopyright © 1980by L.

The idea that a Solo auditor would have to mock himselfup as “the auditor” and mock himself up as “the pc” is erroneous. Nor does the Solo auditor haveto try to be two different. people, nor does Solo auditing consists of “talking to oneself”.In order to understand Solo auditing better, read and demonstrate each of the followingdefinitions until you understand each of them:Auditing Comm Cycle: “This is the auditing comm cycle that is always in use: 1) is the pc readyto receive the command? (appearance, presence); 2) auditor gives command/question to pc(cause, distance, effect), 3) pc looks to bank for answer (itsa maker line, 4) pc receives answerfrom bank, 5) pc gives answer to auditor (cause, distance, effect), 6) auditor acknowledges pc,7) auditor sees that pc received ack (attention), 8) new cycle beginning with (1)” (HCOB 30 Apr71 AUDITING COMM CYCLE)Auditing Cycle: The basic of auditing is an auditing cycle which operates as an attention director.Call it restimulator if you want, but it’s an attention director, eliciting a response from the pc toas-is that area and who knows he has done so when he receives from the practitioner anacknowledgment that it has occurred. That i~ the auditing cycle. “ (SH Spec 189, 6209C18) 2.“There are basically two communication cycles between the auditor and the pc that make up theauditing cycle. They are cause, distance, effect with the auditor at cause and the pc at effect, andcause, distance, effect, with the pc at cause and the auditor at effect . These are completely distinctone from the other. “ (HCOB 23 May 71R IV, Rev . 4 .12 . 74 Basic Auditing Series 4RCOMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN THE AUDITING CYCLE )Communication Cycle: 1. “A cycle of communication and two-way communication are actuallytwo different things. A cycle of communication is not a two-way communication in its entirety.In a cycle of communication we have Joe as the originator of a communication addressed to Bill.We find Bill receiving it and then Bill originating an answer or acknowledgment back to Joe andthus ends the cycle.” (DIANETICS 55! page 82) . “A communication cycle consists of just cause,distance, effect with intention, attention, duplication and understanding. “ (HCOB 23 May 71RIV, Rev. 4 .12.74 Basic Auditing Series 4R COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN THEAUDITING CYCLE."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69Cycle of Action: l. “The sequence that an action goes through, where in the action is started, iscontinued for as long as is required and then is completed as planned.” (Scientology AbridgedDictionary )(The definitions above are taken from the Technical Dictionary.)In Solo auditing the Auditing Question or Auditing Command is provided in the materials.The Solo auditor has to ensure that he understands the Auditing Question or Auditing Command,gets the answer to the question or carries out the command, and recognizes that he has done soand completes that cycle. Solo auditing mainly consists of carrying out cycles of action. This iseasy to do as these are given in the materials, and it consists of doing what the materials say todo.VERBALIZATIONThe Solo auditor does not verbalize questions or commands in solo auditing. It is done ona thought or intention level. There is a solo auditing action in which the Solo auditor calls itemsverbally, but otherwise solo auditing is not verbalized.METER ERRORIn Solo auditing the meter, worksheets and materials must be arranged so that the soloauditor can read the meter at the same time as he reads the question or item in the materials. Thisis because the question or item will read on the meter when the solo auditor reads the question oritem in the materials. One should not ignore the meter read when first reading the question or itemin the materials. This is especially true when checking reads on Ruds, or doing a BPC Assessment,as the read might not repeat. The initial read when the question or item is first read and understoodby the Solo auditor is taken. This is because the read occurs when the Solo auditor thinks thequestion or concept of the item.Another meter error could occur if the Solo auditor didn’t understand the question or item.You could get a reaction because the question or item was misunderstood. And if the question oritem is misunderstood, then you wouldn’t be able to audit it. Therefore it is very important thatthe Solo auditor knows to clear the meanings of words in auditing commands and items.SOLO DRILLSThe Solo Drills are designed to familiarize the Solo auditor with the tools of Solo auditing,and to become skilled so that when the time comes to start Solo auditing, he can put his fullattention on the auditing and thus be fully in session.L.

COURSE - PART ONE1 November 1966The following do not have a Line Plot. They are implant incidents, and should be locatedand plotted on your Track Table. The dates given are sample dates and represent the ap-proximate time period only. Run the basic of each, getting your own reaction to it.THE ARROWTr 30,026This consists of two Targets with an arrow pointing into each, counter poised. Thefront target is white and the rear one is black.The Targets with the arrows appear for 1/10th of a second, during which time it tiltsone way and then the other. It’s terribly fast, so one made a picture to see afterwards what itwas. Get the speed it idi this. Get your own reaction to it. It’s just a sudden appearance anddisappearance. It wobbled in and wobbled out.WOMANTr 25,980A “Woman figure” appeared before one. Nothing happened. It just appeared andremained a few hours. It sort of “got in one’s face”.WHITE BLACK SPHERETr 25,090This is a sphere on a pole. The sphere and pole are Black in front. White in back. It’sbased on the idea that a thetan “can’t think two thoughts at once”. It does not reverse.HOT - COLDTr 20,095This is a pole with a split in it. The back split is hot, the front one is cold. Twotemperatures. Duration is 1 1/8th seconds.LAUGHTER - CALMTr 19,670This takes place in a cave. It is 7 1/8ths of a second in duration. It has screams oflaughter, very wild, and calm. Calm = frozen numbness.It is a pole with a split in it. Laughter comes from the rear half and calm from thefront half simultaneously. Then they reverse. It gives one a sensation of total disagreement.The trick is to conceive of both at the same time. This tends to knock one out.DANCE MOBTr 18,992The duration is 7/8ths of a second. There is a pole that pulls one in. One is caught onthe pole. The actual incident is in connecting with this thing and trying to get off it.The dancing comes after the actual incident, and consists of a mob dancing aroundone, chanting various things (a text).

There is no room for anyarbitraries to enter in, and due to the confidential nature of the material avery firm ethics codeis needed in the area. There is no other source of data than in the materials themselves. Thefollowing regulations have proven successful over many years and are now very strict policy.1.No off-line advice may be sought in cases of students on the Advanced Courses.2.Any “unusual solution” sought or question asked must be answered only by referring torelevant Advanced Course materials and standard word clearing tech by the supervisors.3.Examination of states of case must be done by Qual Examiner and the student’s completefolder must be submitted to such an Examiner at the time of examination for his inspection.4.Any person examining for attained states of case must have been checked out on alltechnical materials of the Advanced Courses.5.Any Examiner examining states of case in Qual must be on OT III or above.6.All Advanced Course personnel must be on OT III or above.7.No person may be admitted on the Advanced Courses who has a bad Ethics history ora this lifetime suppressive order or a criminal record without a special Board of Investigationconvened by the HCO Area Sec.8.No person with a record of using R6EW or Clearing Course materials suppressively maybe admitted on the OT Courses.9.Persons who have been grossly insecure in their handling of R6EW or Clearing Coursematerials or anyone making them available illegally to another may not be admitted on the OTCourse regardless of the action taken at the time.10.Students folders are to be C/Sed after each session. The student goes to the Examinerafter each session.11.After the student has gone to the Examiner, he takes his folder to Solo Tech Reception.12.When an Advance Courses student wishes to communicate to the Case Supervisor abouthis case or his auditing, he must do so either in writing via his folder or as an origination givento the Examiner on the meter."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"23513.If the student needs to clarify a C/S’s instructions or has nay questions or uncertaintyabout his auditing tech he should always write it up and send it to the course supervisor alongwith his folder and the course supervisor will go over it with him giving any needed referencesor drilling.14.No alcohol may be consumed within 24 hours before session and students must notconsume or have administered to them any drugs, antibiotics, aspirin, barbituates, opiates,sedatives, hypnotics or stimulants without written OK from the Course Supervisor and C/S.The only exeption would be a medical emergency, and the C/S must be informed without delay.15.Auditing must be done daily unless the C/S has instructed a break be taken due to a bigwin. AO 1 forms of daily progress must be filled in and handed in at the place designated inthe Solo Tech Reception area.16.Advance Course students are not to discuss their cases with ANYONE except, (1) theCase Supervisor (and then only by written comm put into the auditing folder), (2) the Examinerby way of a metered origination, (3) a review auditor in session or (4) the Solo Case Consultant.17.Students who are in case trouble or who have ceased to audit on Advance Courses shallbe sent to the Solo Case Consultant or to review.18.Advance Courses students session admin must be legible. If it is not it will beconsidered a No Report.19.Advance Courses students should not leave town until given permission to do so inwriting by the Case Supervisor.20.A student who does not qualify as a fast flow student per HCO PL 25 Sep 79SUCCESSFUL TRAINING LINE UP, and therefore takes an examination on the materials ofthe course in Qual, may not take his examination paper or answer sheet out of the Qual areadesignated for confidential exams. After marking, the exam is handed back to the student forreference but it must always be promptly returned by the student after reviewing it as to anyerrors made. It is the Examiners responsibility to see this is done.21.NO UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF UPPER LEVEL MATERIALS ARE TO BEMADE.This means NO notes, NO photocopies, NO “little simplifications”, NO little codes tokeep handy. None of the materials are to be in any way copied, not even partially or in alter-ised form. They must not be tape recorded. Any student possessing “notes” or “study aids”on any Advance Courses issues or films, flash cards, copies of commands, or any such copiesmust immediately destroy them completely.22.Any written references given the student by the Cramming Officer while on a crammingcycle must be handed in to the Cramming Officer ta the end of each cramming period.23.THE ADVANCE COURSES MATERIALS MUST NOT BE WRITTEN ON ORCHANGED IN ANY WAY AT ALL.Violation of points 21, 22 and 23 above will bring about a severe Ethics action, which couldinclude debarment from future Advance Courses ( though not limited to this ).L.

This gives the basisof clusters and having BTs.The cycle is this : A thetan collides with another. That one makes a picture of beingcollided with. Other BTs get stuck to the picture.The moment of actual contact of thetans was brief but the picture ( containing a stopor withdraw ) tends to be permanent.Thetans then get the idea they can be permanently stuck as they see pictures of ithappening.Thus we get the concept of a “black theta body”. This would be actual BTs stuckto a thetan plus pictures of BTs stuck to a thetan.An answer to all this is to find the first picture a thetan made of contacting anotherthetan.If not at once available the earliest instance of a thetan contacting ( colliding,running into, attacking ) another thetan could be acheived by Date/Locating times whenone was being suddenly hit with clusters, or strange pains.

The Modern Science of Mental Health.This was the “Overt-Motivator sequence of ENGRAMS”.AN OVERT, in Dianetics and Scientology, is an aggressive or destructive ACT bythe individual against one or another of the 8 dynamics (self, family, group, Mankind,animals or plants, MEST, Life or the Infinite).A MOTIVATOR is an aggressive or destructive act received by the person or oneof the dynamics.The viewpoint from which the act is viewed resolves whether the act is an overt ora motivator.The reason it is called a “Motivator” is because it tends to prompt that one pays itback—it “motivates” a new overt.When one has done something bad to someone or something one tends to believeit must have been “motivated”.When one has received something bad, he also may tend to feel he must have donesomething to deserve it.The above points are true. The actions and reactions of people on the subject areoften very falsified.People go about believing they were in an auto accident when in actual fact theycaused one.Also people may believe they caused an accident when they were only in one.Some people, on hearing of a death, at once believe they must have killed the personeven though they were far away."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"268Police in large cities have people turn up and confess to almost every murder as aroutine.One doesn’t have to be crazy to be subject to the Overt-Motivator sequence. It is notonly used on him continually by others, it also is a basic part of his OWN “case”.There are two extreme stages of Overt-Motivator phenomena. One is a person whogives up only motivators (always done to him) and the other is the person who “has doneonly overts” (done to others).In running engrams you will find:1.All overt engrams that hang up (won’t audit easily) have also a motivatorengram as the same or different incident.2.All motivator engrams that hang up have an overt engram in the same ordifferent incident.The two types of engrams then are OVERT Engrams and MOTIVATOR Engrams.Example of Overt Engram- SHOOTING A DOG.Example of Motivator Engram—BEING BITTEN BY A DOG.The rule is that the SUBJECT MATTER MUST BE SIMILAR.They can be in different points in time.When you can’t run out (erase) a dog bite engram, why then you find the “shoot dog”engram.PSYCHOSOMATIC ILLS OR ABERRATIONS THAT DO NOT RESOLVE BYRUNNING ONE SIDE, USUALLY RESOLVE BY FINDING AND RUNNING THEOTHER.When you can’t erase an engram about shooting a dog, why then there’s a bitten bydog.It’s all very simple really. There are always two sides to the coin. If one won’t run,you try the other.BASICSFinding the basic engram on a chain also applys to finding the basic overt or basicmotivator engram.Engrams then hang up (won’t run out) when(a) The other type needs to be run and(b) The one found has earlier engrams on it."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"269NON-EXTANT ENGRAMSAn “engram” sometimes didn’t exist. A pc can be trying to run being run over bya car when he never was.What needs to be done, when the incident won’t run, is get the pc’s incident ofrunning over somebody.It also works in reverse. A pc can be trying to recall an engram of running oversomebody when he was in fact only run over himself and never did run over anyone.So BOTH engrams can exist and be run or only one side exists and can be run or witha heavy foul-up on overts and motivators, one side can be non-factual and won’t runbecause only the other side exists.It is easy to visualize this as a matter of flows. An overt of course is an Outflow anda motivator is an Inflow.SECONDARIESIt may never have been said that secondaries always sit squarely on incidents ofactual pain and unconsciousness.Also secondaries can exist on the overt-motivator sequence pattern just as inengrams.This is the cause of frozen emotions or “unemotional” people. Also some peoplecomplain they can’t feel anymore.This works out by overt-motivator sequence. A person in grief over loss (grief isalways loss) who then can’t run it has caused grief and that overt-secondary can be run.Also a person misemotional over causing grief has been caused grief. It works bothways with ALL POINTS ON THE TONE SCALE.The last is a newer discovery and wasn’t known to early Dianeticists.The Overt-Motivator Engram phenomena did not receive adequate dissemination.The principle applied to secondaries has not before been released.It is basically Dianetic Engram running that resolves all cases in the end so one hadbetter be pretty good at auditing Engrams and Secondaries, Motivator and Overt both.L.

He/she cannot put ruds in or do other elementary auditing actions.The remedy is to get the Solo auditor better trained. This may be a matter of crammingor it may be a matter of the Pre OT retreading his Solo course. If the person then still hastrouble on this level, he would need a thorough retread of his Solo auditor course Part Two.The best idea by far is to be at least a Class VI auditor. Those who make fastest progresson III are Class VIIIs, of course.2.The case has not been well prepared due to earlier quickied or incompleteGrades or Rundowns. The case is so overcharged that the Solo auditor cannot “front up”to auditing at OT III. Out of this you get the pathetic case that declares “none on OT III”and tries to attest. Or the one who runs five or six, says “that’s all” and tries to attest. Therehave been cases that took one look at OT III materials, “rabbit”(which is to say run away)and “attest” hurriedly. The remedy for all these is to (a) get ruds well in and use thecorrection lists appropriate to the Solo level they have done, including an LDN, (b) getthe person more training as in 1 above, and (c) get the person through the level standardly,using Review as needed, to an OT III attest.These two actions take care of the majority of “difficult” cases on OT III."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"280These two points have been pretty prevalent, poor auditing and finding none or fewon OT III.

It is a poor thing to have them stumbling around with a false Grade.OT III is NOT a fast Grade.FURTHER III REMEDIESThe common garden varieties used by a Case Supervisor in day to day OT III sessionC/Sing - or the troubles an OT II Solo auditor runs into on OT III now and then in sessionsfollows:3.High TA. This comes from not completing the Incidents II and I on BodyThetans (BTs).4.The Solo auditor puts too WIDE an attention span on the BT and runs two orthree when he is intending to run only one.5.A cluster just won’t break up. The remedy is to check for “Cumulative cluster”or “Mutual incident of another Date”. With a mutual incident of another date, the type ofincident would first be established and the incident then Date/Located per HCOB 15 Nov78, DATING AND LOCATING. A cumulative cluster would be handled per HCOB 25Oct 69RA, Rev. 16 Aug 83, SECRET, CLUSTER FORMATION CUMULATIVE, untilthe cluster was completely blown. When these actions are done in Review and completed,the Solo auditor is sent back to Solo to continue with OT III.There is another action which may be done in Review when a cluster won’t breakup. The Review lists for impacts or incidents that would cause a cluster and handles theitem obtained from the list with Date/Locate. When the Review action is complete, thePre OT goes back to Solo auditing OT III.6.Ruds go out on BTs. This is the usual reason a Solo auditor suddenly feels hedoesn’t want to audit or “needs” a Review. The Solo auditor doesn’t realize, sometimes,he is dealing with living individuals and roughs them up, putting the ruds out on them. Theremedy of course is to locate BTs who have out ruds, put the ruds in and run Incident I,at which the BT should leave.7.A “theta bopping” meter sometimes puzzles a Solo auditor on OT III. Thismeans a BT is trying to exteriorize and can’t. The remedy is to complete the partially runIncident II or Incident I or in extreme cases, put the ruds in on the hung up BT.8.One hand electrode giving a wrong TA read, baffling the Solo auditor withFloating needles with a “High TA”. The remedy is to have two hand electrodes handy andtrim the trim knob so the 1 hand electrode reads the same as the two hand electrodes tocheck the real TA on occasion.9.A suppressive body thetan sometimes isn’t auditable. The remedy is to runGrade IV, then Inc. II and Inc. I. If this doesn’t do it, get power run on the SP BT. Thegreatest error is to get upset with one of these, put the ruds out, and make him submerge.In this case, the suppress button is put in or he is prepchecked and then run on Grade IV,Power, Inc. II and Inc. I. These SP BTs are far less common than is supposed. Solo auditors"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"281with faults as in paragraphs 1 and 2 above, or who miss other matters blame everyfault on SP BTs. They do however exist.10.By far and large the corniest error and which has been very prevalent is notknowing the materials of OT III or the content of Inc II or Inc I. This can get pretty bad.I’ve seen people running Inc II with the date of I! But the funniest error under not knowingthe materials is reading wild adventures alleged to be Inc II and Inc 1.Inc I and Inc II are very precise indeed. The remedy is to send the Solo auditor backto starrate his OT III pack.11.A BT can be overrun. This fact sometimes causes a Solo auditor to believe OTIII is overrun. If he asks “Is OT III overrun?” he may get a read and a blowdown. This isactually just one BT or cluster that is overrun. The way such an overrun can occur iscovered in HCOB 4 May 68R, Rev. 16 Aug 83, Issue II, OVERRUN ON III.The remedy is finding out who was overrun, discovering and indicating the pointof overrun and getting the charge off in that way. The BT or cluster may then just depart.If not, one then runs Inc I on the BT (or handles the cluster) to a blow. Then one carrieson with OT III.Running with a discharged meter, with cans not plugged in or with no meter at all- in short any of the errors you find in auditing can also occur in Solo auditing.However, the faults or troubles 1 to 11 above cover any and all the errors I havefound specifically applying to OT III.This Grade, OT III, is a long and very valuable Grade. IT determines whether or notthe Solo auditor will eventually be a real OT.But the carelessness and casualness with which some Solo auditors often approachOT III and a Solo auditors willingness to run one BT and say “well the rest don’t botherme”, is simply an indication of weakness or Treason on the 1st Dynamic.There is no status value to having “none on III” or in only finding a few or who “blewthem all in Dianetics”. These indicate a Solo auditor who is weak and cannot affect othersand who needs the handlings in 1 and 2 above.OT III is a vital Grade. One fronts up to it and does it. When he is really done, therewards of OT III exceed his wildest dreams.L. RON HUBBARDFOUNDERRTCU:LRH:rw:iwCopyright ( c ) 1983by L.

In this respectthe following scale based on HCOB 23 August 1971 C/S Series No. 1 “Auditors Rights” is of use tothe Solo Auditor:When the ruds go out on BTs during the session the Solo auditor recognizes the following:BT critical = W/H from auditor.BT antagonistic = BPC in session.No TA = Problem.BT sad = ARC BrealkSoaring TA = Overrun or protest; (also more than one BT being run in error or it’s a Cluster.)Auditor tired = No sleep or incomplete Inc 1’s.Auditor dope off = By-passed FN or not enough sleepAuditor no interest = Out ruds on BTs.A solo auditor who isn’t sure what it is but runs into trouble with a BT is smart to end off thesession quickly, write down the full observation and get it to the C/S.The Solo auditor who knows what he is looking at as per the above scale (and the C/S the C/S would give), handles it promptly,BT critical = pull the W/H.BT antagonistic = BPC = assess proper list (such as L1C) and handle.No TA = (or case gain) = Problem = locate the problem and handle.BT sad = ARC Break = locate and handle, itsa earlier itsa.Soaring TA = O/R or Protest (Also more than one BT being run in error or it’s a Cluster) = find which and handle.

There is no change in this.However, in running, the chain may be found to consist of incidents which areconnected with OT III Solo auditing as well as events.Thetans which were not run due to interruptions of Solo III, due to errors by the Soloauditor and incidents in which the pc received BTs as well as impacts making clusters maybe encountered.Such auditing can be apparently full of ARC Breaks but only if the Dianetic auditordeparts from the Auditors Code or regular procedure.The auditing situation may seem to demand changed commands etc., but the onlyfallability can occur if the auditor goes non-standard.For Example:The pc cognites he is not running his own incident but a body thetan. This requiresonly TR 4 as it is only an origin. Acknowledging the fact, the auditor simply goes on.Evaluation by the Auditor can easily and dangerously occur.For example, the pc finds he is relaying the auditing commands to the BT. Thiswould seem to indicate that the auditor changed the wording of R3R to “Have him move________” or some such alteration. To alter commands is fatal. Soon the pc will find theBt is taking the auditing commands directly and and no change of command was needed.The pc relaying BT comments back to the auditor is only a TR 4 situation unless,of course, the command was wrong or a clarification is rsquested. Even then the auditordoes not go non-standard. The primary Dianetic Auditor error in running one BT on Inc1 after another is to use ABCD instead of 1, 2, 3, 4. The last BT blew. The new BT hasn’tgot a date to move to if you just use ABCD. You do 1,2,3,4 on the next BT. You shouldrealize he is a different pc.Running a chain of one emotion or somatic you can get lots of BTs who have a partof that chain. So if one goes down the chain to Inc 1 and blows with an F/N, you may find"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"284the same somatic or emotion on a new BT which will run as in any R3R and again get downto an Inc 1.Example: The Solo auditor has not audited for 6 months. He gets a Dianetic session.Assessed is “A feeling of sadness.” The Dianetic auditor runs a chain consisting of :-1.An interrupted Solo session.2.An overrun Inc 2.3.An Inc 1 to blow and F/N.Now the same item “A feeling of sadness” reads. A chain is run consisting of1.An interrupted Solo session2.Where the BT picked up the pc. Blow F/N.Now the same item reads - “ feeling of sadness “.

It applys ONLY to Dianetic auditing doneon Solo Auditors who are incomplete or overdue or hungup on OT III.__________________One word of warning. BTs are sometimes not very bright and perceive poorly. TheDianetic auditor whose TR 1 is adequate to a regular Dianetic pc but inadequate toauditing a solo auditor’s BTs on a via can cause a lot of ARC Brk, and upset. The BTmisses or doesn’t hear some of the commands and gets confused if the Dianetic auditorhas a too quiet or poorly pronounced TR 1.In auditing a former Solo Auditor on Dianetic auditing, the Dianetic Auditor’s TR1 must be clearly hearable and carefully said."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"285Also, as above, it is easy to mess up on TR 4 and evaluate for the solo-auditor-now-pc “clearing it up by telling him what reads on the meter” etc.__________________OT III pre OTs got a reputation of being hard to run on Dianetics early inDianetic re-development.Only five reasons exist for this:1.A person that high on OT grades audits fast and a comm laggy Dianetic auditorcan drive him up the wall.2.Too quiet or too blurred TR 1.3.A tendency to evaluate instead of using TR 4.4.The numerousness of BT chains on the same item (The BTs being separatednow) making several chains of the same item which if not all run separately leave the pcARC Broken with the by-passed charge of unrun BTs.5.The OT II who is still an OT III and has been on it awhile probably himselfhas no pictures and all the pictures he has are BT pictures.The lower grade pc (before clear) reacts as a composite being all on one chain, soto speak. He is separared into himself and individual BTs and clusters of them when hegets to OT II and so “audits differently”. He easily misowns the pictures, thinking theyare his. And the big Blowdowns you get on such a pc’s item indicates several BTs haveit in common.If a lower grade pc ever got separated out like this, it could be that “he” has severalchains of the same item, meaning he has separated BTs. If the Class VIII sees a lowergrade pc whose “illness won’t recover” he need only have the same items checked thathave already been run on the pc and if one gives a BD, get it run again or again and again.But this means this pc was already-chopped up in sessions in some way so that, unknownto the pc (and you don’t inform him or her) other BTs than that one run had the samesomatic or emotion and only one was run on it. You just leave all items already run on thelist and run them again if they read again. If really flat the item briefly F/Ns but youdisregard the F/N while assessing in this case. The phenomenon is rare that a lower gradepc has to run more than one chain on the same item.A Solo III, however, will be found to have the same Item on more than one BT inmany cases.L.

This applies also to any auditing given on upper OTLevels.That a Pc’s TA goes below 2.0 is a certain indicator of unflat OT III. He’s still got some.When a person cannot handle OT III he is too much at effect. He cannot project hisintention. And so can’t run O TIII.The new OT I and OT II, particularly OT II, are designed to increase a pc’s ability toproject his intention to others. If he can’t, they overwhelm him and you get low TA or “noneon III”. Harsh, overbearing auditing or life incidents have to occur, apparently to drive theTA down.Overts, disagreements expressed as obsessive agreement and other lower lovel mattersare at the bottom of this in any being.But any “case of low TA” I have ever found has been:(1)Overwhelmed in life;(2)Unable to praject intention;(3)Physically inactive;(4)Loaded with BTs;(5)Tends to go out of valence easily .In all this (4) is the important point.The cure is given in HCOB 8 June, 70, Issue 1, and the only thing that this HCO B, IssueII, adds is that it IS (4) above.Endless OT III and Low TA are alike - inability to project intention, pc at effect.Remedy by lightly causing pc to come to cause, to be able to project his intention andthus flatten OTIII.That will complete and finish off low TA.LRH: dzL.

This creates BPC as it gives the rest a wrong item or wrong indication, andit makes the reading question appear to be a generality, when in fact it only applied to oneBT or cluster.By finding the BT or cluster that the read applied to, the auditor then clears the readon that BT or cluster. And then takes any additional steps to get it to blow and blow it.The above does not apply to cases below OT III and must never be mentioned to sucha case.There is a tendency of an auditor trained on general correctlon lists to simply clearthe read without finding where it is coming from and as this omission can jam up a casewho is on OT III or on NOTs, such auditors when doing NOTs or actions on Pre-OTs OTIII or above must learn to handle correction lists in this way.

At this level, when a rudiment is out the Pre OT must be ableto determine whose out - rudiment it is — his own, a BT’s or that of a cluster.MISOWNERSHIPScientology axiom 29:“ In order to cause an As - is - ness to persist, one mustassign other authorship to the creation than his own. Otherwise his view of it would causeit’s vanishment.”This Axiom is especially relevant to auditing at the level of OT III and abovebecause at this level the Pre OT is handling other being than himself ( BTs and Clusters). Axiom 29 tells us that it is necessary to establish correct ownership of charge in orderto get an As - is - ness of the charge.Furthermore, incorrectly assigning charge to the wrong being can cause by-passedcharge ( BPC ) as it is now misowned.Hence the instruction in the OT III materials that one must use a narrow attentionspan so as not to restimulate or confuse other BTs with the one being audited.Finding charge without establishing whose charge it is, and fully handling thecharge for that being, can result in a generality — the idea that the charge belongs to all— when it only belongs to one being. This can cause a wrong indication to the others towhom it does not belong.Finding more than one charge without establishing whose charge it is, and fullyhandling that being, can result in a generality — the idea that the charge found belongsto all — when it only belongs to one being. This can cause an ARC Break or bad reactionas it acts as a wrong indication to the others to whom the charge does not belong. Bycorrectly establishing the ownership of charge, and handling the correct charge on thebeing to whom it belongs, you get an As - is - ness of the charge."},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"291HOW TO FLY THE RUDSThe rudiments questions which contain the word “you” (i.e. “Do you have an ARCBreak?”) are for use on lower level Pcs, but not at OT III or above. When the word “you”is used in a rudiments question on a Pre OT who is OT III or above, it is evaluative. It sayswhose charge it is.The correct wording of rudiments questions for use by the Solo Auditor on OT IIIor above is:“ Is there an ARC Break ?”“ Is there a present time problem ?”“ Is there a withhold ?”“ Is there an overt ?”and when full ruds are being flown:“ Is there an invalidation ?”“ Is there an evaluation ?”By using “Is there an/a ________ ?” you are not evaluating whose charge it is.Then the Solo Auditor can establish whose charge it is by asking:“ Is ( charge found ) mine? A BT’ ? A Cluster’s ? and handle which of these read.Note: Sometimes you may find that a charge can belong to and read on more thanone of the above, in which case you would handle both reads, one at a time. It is alsopossible that an ARC Break, for example, could be shared by all present, and that it is thePre OT’s out rud and also a BT’s or Cluster’s. The question used in this case would be“ Is it also ( mine ) ? ( a BT’s ) ? ( a cluster’s ) ?”.When one rudiment has been fully handled, using the steps above, the Solo Auditorcontinues on down the rudiments questions to the next reading rudiment and handles itas above.EXCEPTIONSometimes the rudiment will run and F/N and blow just on one of the first rudimentquestions alone ( such as, “ Is there an ARC Break ?” or “ Is there a present time problem?”, etc. ), and without differentiating whose charge it is.It is possible that the Solo Auditor may not be able to determine whose it is. Thisis how rudiments run all the time on lower level cases. It just runs generally as therudiment, without establishing whose it is. The trouble one can get into, however, ismisownership, whereby you are running a charge that belongs to a BT as if it were yourown ( the Pre OT’s ) charge. Or the charge of one BT is misowned as belonging to someother BT or Cluster."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"292When misownership of charge occurs, it won’t run or as-is or blow, you can’t F/Nit, and it will start turning on more mass or solidity. If you get into this sort of situation,narrow enough attention span, sort out whose it is and handle accordingly.But if when flying a rudiment, or other charge found such as a reading line on aprepared list, it just runs and blows, realize you’ve had a lucky break. Don’t interrupt thisto try to find out whose it is or try to take it up again after it has blown.This is obvious enough when it happens because as soon as you get onto the readingrudiment or reading line the charge starts coming off and the whole thing F/Ns and blows.This is a special condition and if it doesn’t occur you always proceed according tothe steps given under “How To Fly The Ruds”.RULEUnless you get a discharge and blow of the rudiment as described under “Exception”above, it is essential to find out if any charge found belongs really to the Pre OT himselfor to a BT or a Cluster when the charge is found.Don’t fly all the ruds, for example, and then ask: “ Are all these .... ?” as that wouldgeneralize it.The rule is : ON RUDS, OR ON A PREPARED LIST, OR WHEN FINDING ACHARGE ON A CASE, AT ONCE CHECK IF THAT CHARGE BELONGS TO A BTOR CLUSTER, and if so, find where that BT or Cluster is and limit your attention to thatspecific area when F/Ning the read. And then take any additional steps to blow that BTor Cluster. And blow it.These rules for the Solo Auditor on OT III or above apply when putting ruds in atthe start session and apply as well to ruds going out during the session. ( Ref: HCOB 16Aug 83, CONFIDENTIAL, SOLO C/S Series No. 7, RUDS GOING OUT ON BTS. )The handling in the later case is the same.CAUTIONThe ruds question : “ Is there a/an .... ?” can be asked of any case, but the remainderof the data in this HCOB does not apply to cases below OT III and must never bementioned to such a case.SUMMARYBefore you begin solo auditing on OT III get this procedure drilled until you can doit smoothly and precisely.With the principle of misownership and As - is - ness understood and the procedurewell drilled, flying ruds at OT III and above is a piece of cake.Good auditing!LRH: skL.

They mock up the biochemistry and they mock upthe drug and drug incidents. Drug taking in this lifetime restimulates earlier incidents of drugtaking on the track. When the case is viewed as a composite of BTs and clusters, you will see thatdrug taking in this lifetime causes a highly multiple restim. A drug incident can be a clustermaking incident.Earlier drug cultures on the track were much worse than this drug culture. In some culturesthe psychiatrist, priest and medico were all one and the same person and frequently used drugs.Some implanters used drugs, either as part of the implant incident or to keep a populationenslaved thereafter. When BTs and clusters who have whole track drug incidents are restimulatedby a this lifetime drug incident, there is a multiple restim, and if severe enough can form a newcluster composed of the BTs and clusters thrown into restimulation by the drug."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"324The residual drug remaining in the body tends to keep these BTs and clusters inrestimulation, and they by mocking it up, tend to hold onto the drug and keep the drug picturesin restim.There are two factors regarding drugs: (1) There is the factor of residual drugs in the body,and (2) There are BTs and clusters who are stuck in whole track drug incidents which they aremocking up. These two factors are interactive.The residual drug deposit in the body causes a drug effect and tends to keep BTs andclusters in restimulation. It is this residual drug deposit that is gotten rid of by sweat out on thePurification Rundown.BTs and clusters who are stuck in whole track drug incidents continue to mock it up. Theyactually mock up the drug as well as the incident. This can give the apparency that the drug is inthe body. After all a thetan can create MEST, and because they are mocking up the drug, andbecause they are stuck in it totally, you can get the apparency that there is a residual drugremaining in the body.Where you have both factors present, (the residual drug deposit in the body and BTs/clusters stuck in drug incidents), it’s absolutely deadly. The drug deposit in the body tends to holdonto BTs and clusters and to keep them in restimulation. And BTs and clusters who are stuck inwhole track drugs mock up the drug and the drug incident giving the apparency of drugs in thebody. These two factors are interactive both ways, the actual residual drug in the body affects thebody and keeps BTs and clusters in restim, who, because they are mocking up drugs that they arestuck in, are creating the apparency of more drugs in the body, and so it goes.The Purification Rundown will handle a lot of this by getting rid of the residual drugs inthe body, and this in itself not only improves the person physically, but also will allow much ofthe BT and cluster pictures to drop out of restimulation, or at least to drop out of chronicrestimulation.There is another process pretty well forgotten about called freewheeling. This wasdiscovered in earlier research, and is described in Science of Survival, II, p. 260, where it ispointed out that Guk (see All About Radiation) can cause the somatic strip to freewheel. Theactive ingredients of Guk being Vitamin B1 and Niacin, and these cause BTs and clusters tofreewheel through engrams they are stuck in on the track, they don’t get down to a basic oranything, they unstick from the stuck point in a track engram. This permits that engram to dropout of chronic restimulation. So we have another phenomenon going on the PurificationRundown that persons below OT III case level would not be aware of. The B1 and Niacin bymoving BTs and clusters out of the engram they are chronically stuck in, permits these BTs andclusters to drop out of restimulation, and thus cease mocking it up. This too brings about animprovement in the case condition of the person.You should also know that when the BT or cluster is Free-wheeling through such a drugincident it can turn on the apparency of that drug in the body. This could be puzzling if you didn’tknow this datum. Maybe the guy has never taken LSD or Pheno-barbitol in this lifetime anddoesn’t have any of that drug actually in his body, But the BT or cluster freewheeling throughan incident containing the drug mocks up the apparency of that drug in the body, making the guyfeel that he is on that drug. And there have been other drugs on the whole track quite differentfrom any drugs in existence today. So during the Purification Rundown you can have a BT orcluster freewheel through and out of a stuck drug engram, and while he’s going through it therecan be an apparency of that drug in the body even though he’s never taken it in this lifetime, butwhen the BT or cluster freewheels on out of that stuck point, it ceases to mock up the apparencyof that drug in the body. Hence get a two way result on the Purification Rundown by getting ridof both the residual drug in the body and the apparency of the drug in the body mocked up by aBT or cluster."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"325How many of these BTs and clusters actually blow during the Purification Rundown isunknown, but there definitely will be less of them present when he’s through the Rundown, andthe case will be a lot better off, though not completely and entirely handled on the subject of drugs.(Caution: The attention of auditors and C/Ses is called to the OT III data, that a person canalso freewheel straight through Inc II - this is different from freewheeling out of a drug incidentas described above in this issue - but should someone start freewheeling through Inc II, and weknow of no instances of this having occurred, the possibility is that it can occur. The descriptionof a freewheel through Inc II is given in the OT III materials and the handling is given in HCOB2 Oct 68 OT III and 3RD NOTE, RUNNING INCIDENT II of 28 Oct 68 both of which are inthe OT III pack.)Normally we would run Objectives and a NED Drug Rundown after the PurificationRundown, and these actions, particularly running out drug incidents, would handle much of theseBT/cluster drug pictures - without the case ever being aware of it at that level. But there are alsocases who are Dianetic Clears who are in a body stuffed up with drugs (in fact there is probablya high incidence of Clears who are now doing the Purification Rundown), and these cases cannotbe run on R3R or R3RA as they are Clears. This poses a problem of how to handle these Clearsafter their Purification Rundown.Clears can be run on Objectives (though you must not re-run an Objective process that hasalready been run to EP); Clears can be run on recall or straightwire processes and thus can be runon Recall processes on Drugs and the L3RF and End of Endless Drug Rundown can be done onClears (provided you handle reading lines by indication and do not attempt any R3R or R3RA).These actions will handle a lot of the mental aspect of drugs and drug taking and will enable youto then get the case up the Grade Chart to OT III.On OT III the Solo auditor will handle and blow many of these BTs and clusters withoutnecessarily ever being aware of, nor having to address drug pictures. But some BTs and clusterscan be so held down by drugs, or hung up in drug cluster- making incidents that the Solo auditoris unlikely to be able to audit or handle these, and will need auditing by an OT III Drug RDAuditor.LIABILITY OF HANDLING DRUGS AT OT IIIAs drugs and drug incidents have been so common on the whole track, to simply generallyask for drugs or drug incidents when dealing with BTs and clusters, could cause a total restim.It would be likely to throw a large number of BTs and clusters (each of whom individually havedifferent incidents), into restim on drugs. The liability then is that of throwing the whole case intorestim on the subject of drugs.HOW TO HANDLE DRUGS AT OT IIIBy adding “Drugs” into an existing list or prepared assessment, the subject of drugs is thenonly mentioned in relation to a specific area and the liability of over-restimulation is avoided.This makes it possible to handle drugs at the level of OT III.1.Having found the position of a cluster or pressure area in relation to the body, the auditorhas the Pre-OT limit his attention to that area (so as not to restim other areas).2.Find the type of incident that made it into a cluster by assessment of: “Accident, Impact,Injury, Illness, a drug, shock, Implant, heat, freezing, electrical, explosion, implosion, psychiat-ric incident, lightning, burning, vacuum, radiation.” (Usually the read will occur early on theassessment; don’t go on assessing after you have got the read.) The auditor indicates the type ofincident that read on the assessment and confirms the read. Sometimes you will get a BD and abreak up or blow on this step alone."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"3263.Date the incident to blow.4.Locate the incident to blow.5.Handling any remaining single BTs to blow.6.Check for and handle any copy.(It is essential that the auditor have the Pre-OT limit his attention to the specific area of thebody found, so as not to stir up other BT or cluster masses. And it is essential not to overrun thisaction and start in on other BTs who were not part of this incident and to whom this does notapply.)One can ask for a drug or a drug incident on a specific BT or cluster, provided it is limitedto that area, and not asked generally.On a prepared list such as a C/S 53 being done on an OT III or above, if you get a read onany of the lines in the Drug section of the C/S 53, be sure to find the position of the BT or clusterthat the read is coming from (per HCOB 4 Jul 79 HANDLING CORRECTION LISTS ON OTs).Heavy this lifetime mutual drug incidents (or drug trips) can be Dated and Located, butrealize that a this lifetime incident is late on the track, and that there could be an earlier (wholetrack) mutual incident (ref: Cumulatlve clusters).There was a case who refused to do a Purification RD, who was handled by the techniquesgiven above, and then became willing to do the Purification RD, as he now realized that he hadbeen the effect of drugs and now wanted to get it handled.Prior Assessment:There is a way to use the Prior Assessment to taking drugs at this level.By taking up the somatics and misemotions the person experienced prior to taking drugs (as isdone in a Drug RD), you can then find the BT or cluster and blow it. Instead of running the PriorAssessment item by R3RA as one would do on a Drug RD, (and you must be very careful not torun any R3R or R3RA), you simply take up a reading somatic or misemotion from the list ofsomatics Prior to taking drugs, have the Pre-OT locate where the BT or cluster is by position inrelation to the body, and blow the BT or cluster by usual techniques. This technique has provenvery effective in handling two somatic-shut-off cases.SOMATIC SHUT-OFF CASESYou can find a BT with misemotion on drugs, and especially with an absence of emotion,absence of sensation, absence of perception, absence of feeling. The “lack of_____” or the“absence of_____”, (the blank being any emotion, feeling or perception), is just as common ondrugs and drug items as the somatic item connected with the drug. (Hence somatic shut- offscaused by drugs and medicines, etc.) These have in earlier materials been called “negative items”due to the absence or lack of an expected emotion, feeling or perception. Whether this “negativeitem” is the result of a somatic being suppressed by a drug or anesthetic, or whether it is aninability to feel or perceive due to a drug in the body or an accumulation of drugs in the body,such “negative items” are equally important to ask for and to handle in the handling of drugs, asare somatics and misemotions induced by drugs. As these “negative items” are an omitted (a not-thereness of something), they may not be noticed or volunteered by a pc unless asked for them,and sometimes pcs come up to an awareness of a numb area of the body.CASE HISTORIESThe following case histories (reported by FSO C/Ses), of case handlings piloted on"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"327the subject of drugs on OT III Pre-OTs show what can be done:Case 1:“LSD case. Ran BTs and clusters stuck in drug experiences. Date/Located bad drugexperiences.“He experienced relief and stopped complaining that the auditing was having no effect onhim. Case had a tendency to blow out quickly without big wins, unable to continue session. Wasable to run longer sessions after handling drugs as above.”Case 2:“LSD Constant roller-coaster. Critical. Felt crazy, lots of restim.“An R/Sing cluster went to basic incident of an LSD trip. Said grief charge persisting fromacid trips. LSD came up frequently in her auditing. (The grief was handled.)”Case 3:“LSD. Had many drug trips that created clusters on LSD and LSD mixed with other drugs.A C/S 53 handled per HCOB 4 Jul 79 HANDLING CORRECTION LISTS ON OTs, was doneand drugs read a lot. Each read was handled and each cluster connected blown. Also handled BTsstuck in drugs.“He got relaxed in the environment, felt there was hope and destimulated. It was the firstsignificant gain he had made.”Case 4:“LSD and other heavy drugs. She was also ‘over-restimulated’. Was put on GF 40Expanded and drugs read. She blew many clusters made during LSD and speed. She finished theGF 40 Expanded and later would find masses that were related to LSD and say: ‘that was madeon acid’, and it would BD, and was handled to blow.“She then ran smoother and her comm line was better and the over-restimulation ended.”Case 5:“Heavy drug history. No somatic case. Was 2WCed to find what he was like prior to drugswhich revealed back somatics and misemotions. BTs connected with the misemotions and backsomatics were handled, as well as BTs stuck in drugs.“He ran much better after this and it ended the somatic shut-off.Case 6:“Very similar to Case #5 above. BTs stuck in drugs and prior somatics to drugs werehandled and he came around and ran properly.”Case 7:“Heavy druggie. Case opened up dramatically on the handling of a drug cluster-makingincident which had been the major point of case deterioration this lifetime.(became psychotic inthe incident). The handling of this incident changed his life.Case 8:"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"328“Slow resistive case. Had been bumping into BTs and clusters stuck in anesthetics thislifetime. Still needs to be directly addressed. Not gotten to as he had wins and completed currentauditing hours paid for.”Case 9:“Heavy drugs and alcohol. Run on BTs and clusters stuck in drugs, restimulated by drugs,stuck in alcohol, restimulated by alcohol. Had C/S 53 and GF 40 Expanded reads on drugshandled.“Case running better after the above. Still has more to be handled.”Case 10:“LSD and alcohol.“Drugs often came up as a cluster-making incident.“Was stuck in a drug ‘exteriorization’, was actually a flashing drug picture.“Had a good win on handling BT/cluster influenced by drugs. On handling BT/clusterrestimulated by taking drugs a number of old drug pictures and sensations turned on and blew.On handling BT/clusters stuck in drugs a reasonableness he still had on drugs was handled.“These handlings were a ‘win point’, he had felt paranoid about drugs up until now. He alsofelt lighter.“Later on a C/S 53, LSD read and on handling, turned on and blew an electric shock typesomatic.“Case had a lot of gain from the above handlings.”PROGRAM FOR THE OT DRUG RDA.SET-UP:The case must be set-up for the OT Drug RD by doing the Purification RD, and this isessential. (Obviously there would be no point in trying to handle BTs/clusters hung up in drugswhile there is still a residue of drugs remaining in the body.) The only apparent exception to thisrule would be as described in this issue, where some drug handling might have to be done in orderto get the Purification RD done, but this would be rare and would be followed by the PurificationRD, then the full steps of the OT Drug RD. Not only is the Purification RD a required set-up, butthere is a very great deal to be gained from doing it as the reader of this issue will understand.B.THE OT DRUG RD:1.Based on folder study and as deemed necessary by the C/S a case can be prepared for theRD by assessing and handling a C/S 53 (in accordance with HCOB 4 Jul 79 HANDLINGCORRECTION LISTS ON OTs), or even a GF 40 Expanded. (Ref: C/S Series 1 - 10, C/S Series17.) This step would at least include getting the Ruds in, and may contain other specific neededrepair actions if the case has had a rough time in previous auditing or on Advanced Courses. Thisstep requires some C/S skill so as not to over-do nor under-do the Repair, as covered in C/S Series17.2.Date/Locate reading (charged) cluster-making drug incidents (i.e. heavy trips, anestheticoperations, severe medicinal drugs or medication), in this lifetime. These having happened to thePre-OT’s current body, tend to be held in common as mutual incidents."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"329Use the procedure for handling clusters (or cumulative clusters).3.Handle any pressure areas and any numb (lacking sensation) areas of the body by locatingwhere the area is, assessing for the mutual incident, Date/Locating it, IIs and Is, copies.4.Take any previously given Drug somatic items, or newly list any additional itemsconnected with reading drugs, medicines, etc., and assess for reading somatic item. (DO NOTRUN ANY R3R OR R3RA) If the BT or cluster that had that item is still there, it will read onthe meter. Locate the BT or cluster that the somatic item belongs to by meter read on the positionin relation to the body. Blow the BT or cluster by usual OT III actions, (i.e. Inc II, Inc I, or clusterhandling or cumulative cluster handling).(Caution: It can occur that the BT or cluster who had that item has already blown, but someother BT or cluster is copying it, giving a false apparency that the item still exists. This isdescribed and the handling for it is given in Section III OT, ADDITIONAL SHEET, NOTES ONRUNNING, page 2.)Be sure to include here any “negative items” previously given, or to list for these, andhandle these too, as above.On this step one exhausts all reading drug somatic items and all reading drugs.(Caution: Never run anything that does not read. Buttons may be checked on unreadingitems, but if it doesn’t read, do not take it up.)(Note: If you run into an item that was badly messed up in earlier auditing on R3R or R3RA,you may have to repair it by assessing an L3RF using the item as the prefix, with the Pre-OTholding his attention on that specific BT. Indicate only, do not attempt any engram running, whenrepaired, blow the BT or cluster with usual OT III techniques, if not already blown on the L3RF.)5. Prior Assessment. Take up any previously listed, now reading, misemotion or somaticitem, or “negative item” given on a Prior Assessment to drugs or alcohol or medicine, and handlewith the same procedure given in #4 above. Find out when the person started taking drugs ormedicine, and 2WC for any prior somatics (and “negative items”) and handle any of these thatread, as in #9 above.6.LDN OT III RB. Assess and handle an LDN OT III RB to clean the case up. This will eithergo to an F/Ning list rather easily, or the case will return to Solo. (As some cases who have attestedpreviously, may find more to run after the OT Drug RD, but this will not always be so.)WARNING:Although it is stated in earlier materials that an item once having read, even thoughit does not currently read, should be run, that does not apply to the OT Drug RD. If the BT orcluster whose item it is is still present the item will read. If the item no longer reads the BT orcluster has already blown or it is Suppressed or Invalidated. One must not run any unreading itemas doing so risks giving other BTs and clusters on the case (to whom this item does not apply)a wrong item, which can be very upsetting to the case. It can also result in other BTs obsessivelycopying the item and making it more solid. Refer to the section on Misownership in HCOB 22Dec 79. False reads will have the same effect, so the auditor must know how to read a meter, andshould only use a serviced meter, preferably a Mark VI. Flows of an item are not taken up, onlythe item, for obvious reasons.COMPLETION AND NEXT STEPWhen the Pre-OT has completed the above Steps 1 - 6, the OT Drug RD is complete andthe Pre-OT is sent to declare. He or she would then be advised of the next step, either next OTlevel, NED for OTs, (sometimes a return to Solo III materials). The Pre-OT will be in"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"330very good shape and if the OT Drug RD has been well audited and C/Sed, will probably makefaster case gain on subsequent actions, and will probably have a faster learning rate, in additionto case gains made on this RD. Although these should not be promised, their absence should resultin an immediate FES and repair of the RD.While it is possible that the Solo auditor will blow a lot of these BTs and clusters that wereaffected by drugs during Solo auditing on OT III or OT III Expanded, and while some cases mightnot have to have the OT Drug RD, it is probable that the majority of cases will need this RD tohandle the effects of drugs, medicines, etc., especially those who have had heavy drugs.Each of the methods given herein have been tested and proven workable. Sometimes therehave been dramatic results from these handlings of drugs given herein on cases who hung fire orwere resistive.Provided you do not make the error of broadly asking for drugs on cases at this level (whichwould cause over-restimulation), you now have the means for handling drugs at the level of OTIII and OT III Expanded.L.

Even the modern physicist, withhis many names and labels, is still in the dark when it comes to how it got here and why.Before Scientology, the exact truth about the MEST universe was lost, and the way outof the trap unknown. Lies and misinformation had taken the place of the truth.In 1967, L. Ron Hubbard released Section V of the Operating Thetan Course, themost powerful level released up to that time. On OT V you learn the truth about thephysical universe, not the laws of physical scientists, but the basic considerations aboutMatter, Energy, Space and Time.The tremendous power that this universe seems to have over thetans resulting inentrapment, degradation and death, is traced to its source.As you exteriorize from the physical universe at Section V, you discover exactlywhat MEST is, and become free of its laws.At OT V, a being is refamiliarized as a thetan exterior with the physical universe.OT drills are done to remarkably increase a being’s ability to communicate with hisenvironment. He is now able to do so, totally free of the mind and body, and free from afixated introversion into MEST.Solo auditing on this level serves as an introduction to the rehabilitation of his totalabilities as a thetan. He learns to use his new abilities as a thetan with wisdom andjudgment.OT 5-1A)Fly Ruds if needed.B)Pre OT is to lie down in a comfortable popsition with eyes shut.1)Spot a spot in the room2)Spot a spot in your bodyAlternate command 1 and 2 until process is flat (Cognition, VGIs, No more change),then3)Spot two spots in your body4)Spot two spots outsideAlternate until flat, then"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"3365)Spot a spot outside6)Spot a spot on the sun(Notice the difference between).

It is called “NED for OTs”. This RD is a prerequisite for OT VIII.Its EP is CAUSE OVER LIFE. The RD steps are covered in separate issues. This issuecovers the theory behind the action and also includes OT III data which has never beforebeen released.The reason Dianetic auditing messes up Clears and OTs is that when an auditor asksfor an earlier similar which doesn’t exit, you’ll probably go over into a cluster or BT whereit does exist. You see the Clear or OT doesn’t have pictures of his own so the Dianeticchain is being run on a BT or cluster and it really caves in somebody when asked for anearlier similar that doesn’t exist, on that BT or anywhere else. And it’ll jump the guystraight into another BT or cluster. And you get chaos.BTs are easily monitored by the think of the pc, and they can actually respond toanything he thinks. They’re totally at effect. Their banks are controlled by exactly whatthe person thinks at them. Just like an auditor can control the time track of a pc. Samephenomena. A person can see the pictures of a BT or cluster because there is an intimate tactileconnection between the person and the BT. A person can “think” at a BT or cluster, apicture will turn on in the BT or cluster representing that think and the person will see itas a picture and erroneously suppose it is his own if he doesn’t know this phenomenon.SOMATICSA BT or cluster has three choices - it can run its own life or run yours or run nothing.The things you run into with somatics are not likely to be of the category of your life,they’re more likely to be in the category of the BT’s life. So it gets to be a dizzy scene."},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"374There’s a way you can detect that a person is not really running his own incident.Let’s say the listed somatic is “a pain in the ear”. Well, great. When he runs the thing heayeven get a little twitch in the ear. But he will get something “having” a pain in the ear. Itwould be uncommon for him to actually get a pain in the ear. In other words he doesn’tget the somatic where it is supposed to be on the body. That’s because the BT isn’t in thatposition. He’s liable to get a pain in the kidney, do you see? Or a pain in the eye. Thisisn’t inevitable. Once in a while the guy gets a pain in the forehead. Let’s say this somaticwas “a pain in the forehead”. He actually runs an incident and there’s a slight somatic inthe forehead but it’s kind of weird because it doesn’t actually run out on his own forehead.It might disappear but it didn’t disappear on his own forehead.MENTAL TRANSMISSIONWhen you talk about telepathy, there is a proximity factor. When a thetan is pressedstraight up against another thetan very tight, total tactile communication, you get this typeof mental transmission. You can achieve it by reaching, when there is no tactile. You haveto reach your attention a considerable distance. You can do it. An example of this is wheretwo guys who are in relatively good shape start putting postulates at the same point on awall that’s maybe twenty feet away in front of them when they’re sitting side by side. Andthey start putting postulates at a certain preconceived spot on the wall. Both of them willperceive a bzbzbzbzzzzz of sort of little energy explosions. Not small - maybe 3 or 4 feetwide and a couple of feet high. It’s when they both did it simultaneously. Two postulateswill collide in the same exact place in the mest universe and go bzzzzzzt. It will happen;that’s at a distance. But apparently there’s such a thing as a tactile. After all you realizethe amount of mass that is connected with a BT - he’s massed up. You put an impulse intothat mass and the mass is up against the body - you put an impulse into the body it goesinto that mass. The BT can respond. Unwittingly, unknowingly, totally at effect. Makeshim hard to handle, by the way. That’s how you can make them run an Incident I and anIncident II. They just run it willy nilly. They can’t help themselves. And it as-ises in thebank and that normal phenomena takes place and they go bzzzzzt, unless you yourselfhave put up a ridge with anger or emotion or something of the sort. I know some guys tryto do it vocally or something stupid. What’s interesting is the number of BTs that havestrings into the body. You think they blow and they still have a connection - beams.VALENCES AND “SHELL BT”The sizes of incidents are very often wrong, and an out of valence phenomenaoccurs. The bulk of BTs and clusters are out of valence and often the pictures seen arevery small. Now on the other hand a Pre-OT (who thinks he is running his own incidentbut is actually running a BT or cluster) can seem to be totally in valence at one point ofa chain. Just one point. The rest of it, no. And what the Pre-OT should suspect at thattime is that he has a BT that surrounds his whole body. This would be a “Shell BT”. AClear can go into the valence of and see the pictures of this BT or cluster. All these thingsconfuse a person trying to run this because he’ll take this one point of valence and it sortof “proves” it to him that it must be his incident.The Shell BT is a composite body entity which is a mock-up that thinks (mistakenly)that it is holding the body together. You can collide with that. I suppose that’s reallyprobably what they think is the astral body, a collection of BTs and clusters molded intoa semblance of a body structure. As this “astral body” is highly electronic. BTs andclusters can easily get stuck in it even though they themselves are creating it."},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"375DATA ON MIS-RUN DIANETICSThere’s another interesting phenomena which occurs on any pc that is mis-run onDianetics. If an auditor asks for an earlier similar which doesn’t exist, the pc will lookover into a cluster or BT where it does exist. So therefore you mustn’t ever pressure a pcfor earlier incidents which don’t exist in the same being or beings. A guy can find it easilyor it isn’t there because it’s a different kind of jumped chain. The pc isn’t jumping fromone of his chains to another one of his, he’s jumping from one of his chains to a BT orcluster’s chain. (A Clear or above would be jumping from one BT chain to another.) Let’ssay the guy is running his own chain. And then all of a sudden the auditor goofs and insiststhere must be an earlier incident. He’s got an erasure going and instead of paying anyattention to this erasure he demands an earlier incident. He’ll jump the pc over into a BTthat’s probably been stone dead for god knows how long. The auditor jams up the case.And the way he prevents this from happening is to never run past the postulate, just as itsays in R3RA.DUB-INAs the Pre-OT increases in power and has more thetan power, the BTs and clusterswill mock up what the Pre-OT thinks and become totally the subject of the Pre-OT’scontrol. The Pre-OT doesn’t realize that he’s getting suckered into believing that they arehis pictures. It seems to prove itself: The Pre-OT thinks “can of beans” and he is instantlypresented with a picture of a can of beans. That is the actual liability mechanism. Butyou’re not running them out of you, you see. So it can look like the fellow is running outhis own incident. That’s why a Clear or Dianetic Clear can get suckered into believingthat his pictures have come back. That’s the exact mechanism. He’s gone up inhorsepower. Any BT or cluster he has anywhere around him will respond exactly andtotally subordinated. They go into almost instant control. He thinks a thought in theirdirection and they can actually mock up a picture which isn’t their picture or anything else.You get dub-in. They didn’t know anything about it but they mocked up the picture. Andthat’s the explanation of dub-in!MEMORYThe dub-in phenomena also affects a Clear or above’s memory. You say “Well, Iwas Aloysius George Smith in 1862”. And you get a picture of Aloysius George Smithin 1862 gratuitously furnished you by a BT - and it will be\"his\"version of 1862. Now, itwill be correct that you were Aloysius George Smith in 1862 but the truth of the matteris that you (as a Pre-OT) don’t have any pictures of it. It’s interesting because you won’tfind you have a consecutive life in pictures. It’ll be kind of like a very poor slide showsubtituted for a movie. You can say you were in Flanders in 1803 or you were at Oxford,and you will notice if you watch closely you may still have some very active BTs that youwill get a gradually dawning picture of Oxford from. But they may think that Oxford isthe same thing as Arcturus so god knows the accuracy of the pictures that you get. Whena person is Clear he does have an accurate memory but because this other phenomenonoccurs and somebody furnishes him with a picture of Oxford, then he says “I’d better lookat the pictures of Oxford” and instead of remembering it straight he gets all fouled up.DORMANT BTs AND CLUSTERSIn NED for OTs you are actually handling, in the main, dormant BTs and clusters."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"376These are not really alive enough to run Incident IIs and Incident Is on. They havedifferent considerations, these dormant BTs and clusters, but they add up to being deador below being dead. They’re in the state that FBI agents and government officialseventually wind up in when they aren’t already simply an animated dormant cluster. Ifpeople who are busy trying to smash up Scientology realized what they themselves wereheading for, they would have a couple of other thinks, as the state of these dormant BTsand clusters is pretty grim. They are not really dead, they just hope they are. And it’s apretty poor view looking forward to the next trillion years in that state. These aren’tnormally touched in basic OT III auditing but one can become aware of them because theycan produce somatics and out body conditions.Now when you audit Dianetics on Pre-OTs, you possibly wake up very dormantBTs and clusters that actually have never been hit on OT III - never dreamed they existed.These will be uncovered especially when a Pre-OT is run on “never happened”, “wasn’tthere” type chains. These are denyer type chains and running them will open up some BTchannels that had been completely dormant. There’s mention of this back in the early50’s. “You will sometimes get into parts of the bank which had better be left closed.” Thisis actually the phenomena that was discovered at that particular time. I just knew it existed.It was a dormant something, in a totally dormant condition. They can’t be awakened witha hand grenade normally. They also won’t assess. So you get into these when the auditorhas taken up a non-reading item. They are usually not live on a meter. They practicallyrun on, being dormant, to the end of the universe unless somebody disturbs them. Theydon’t usually activate when you just put your attention on them, they’re really dead. Youhave to actually put some life into them to activate them. They’re like pebbles on a beach.Anyway, the EP of OT III gives only an apparency that all BTs and clusters are gone.There’s an axiom that says absolutes are unobtainable. If you don’t ever want to run intoany more BTs or clusters, well you’d better go find some universe where they don’t exist.But actually, there are fewer of them hitting people and bouncing around than one wouldthink. They light less often than one would suppose. But listen, you’re living in a universewhich is crawling with this type of stuff. And planet Earth was a dumping ground to endall dumping grounds. Actually, the end of OT III is when those BTs and clusters that areeasily put into communication are gone. It’s not when all BTs in the whole universe thatever will be, are gone.NED for OTs handles those BTs and clusters which, while they could still affect thebody, are not readily responsive to OT III handling. As NED for OTs is run these catswake up and get handled. This relieves the Pre-OT of a lot of phenomena which puzzleshim and can hold him down. As you go along in running it you will find that the materialto which NED for OTs is addressed seldom considers itself live beings. It thinks it isMEST, body parts, significances, conditions - anything but a live being. Because a thetancan’t do anything but survive, the states he can get into exceed what we normally thinkof as living beings. Even though you will occasionally find “live” BTs and clusters inrunning NED for OTs the bulk of the material you are handling considers itself outsidethat category. While it responds to all the laws of life it requires a special address to getit into the realm of awareness that it is alive.You’ve never had any pcs like that unless you’ve worked in an institution and haveseen some inmate living in a totally lifeless state, unaware of anything. NED for OTshandles this condition on BTs and clusters which existed without being suspected exceptfor the occasional clue of a strange picture or a wild somatic.LRH:mm:kjmL.

Anyattempt to run a Dn or Scn Clear on Dianetics, NED, XDN or any R3R, causesrestimulation of BTs and clusters, and it is their pictures he sees and tries to run as his own,which is a “misownership” of the incident/picture. As he thinks it’s his picture he\"misidentifies\" himself with the BT or cluster whose picture it is. Now if this iscompounded by a wrong or misassessed item (uncharged), these BTs and clusters havea wrong item resulting in further restimulation. If a BT incident is overrun, or the auditorasks for an earlier incident than basic, the pc jumps to another BT or cluster, pulling moreand more BTs and clusters into restimulation. Their pictures are copied and cross-copiedby other BTs and clusters, making a mess.A Clear can go into the valence of, and see pictures of BTs and clusters; makes themistake of thinking they’re his incidents and pictures, and down he goes. This doesn’tnecessarily affect the person himself, but it does affect the body - severely. Most of theseBTs are dormant, dead, way below unconsciousness. There are lower states of non-existence that these BTs are in. Their mass and density are great, and they are packed inon the body. When activated these impinge on the body as they are physically attachedto it, and via the body are connected to the being, resulting in illness, possibly worse - thepc can be severely incapacitated. If he’s a Dn or Scn Clear and not up to OT III, he’s atrisk. All you can do is get him up to OT III so it can be handled. Clears should be toldthey’re at risk until OT III, and shouldn’t stay in the Non-Interference Zone. After OTIII they can be handled on NED for OTs. And you don’t run Power, R6EW or the ClearingCourse on a Dianetic Clear. They go straight onto OT I, then OT II, then OT III. (They’llneed to learn to solo audit on the Solo Auditor Course first of course.)So we have the firm rule:NO ENGRAM RUNNING, NO POWER PROCESSING, NO R6EW, NOC.C., NO DIANETICS OF ANY KIND, ON A DIANETIC ORSCIENTOLOGY CLEAR.LRH:dm:kjmL.

(HCOB 11.5.65) During researchon NED for OTs I discovered thatDormant BTs are stuck in a reviv,i.e. they are stuck down the trackin an incident which is present timeto that BT. I also discovered thatthese BTs are reviv’d in a location,meaning that they are stuck in a pastlocation. They are chronically stuckin a past time and place, which forthem is still going on.

Not impolite. Not rough, savage, noblame, shame, regret, nothing. Just dead calm. No unfriendliness, no friendliness. A zero attitude. Thebest way to handle it is just zero everything. If you engage in chatter or conversation with them it just stirsthem up more. Getting rid of them angrily, they don’t get rid of.And of course you audit them telepathically, not verbal comm.AN AUDITED, NOT SOLO ACTIONOne of the reasons NED for OTs is an audited action, and not Solo, is because two cans give a greaterdepth of read than a Solo can. On a Solo can you get to a point where all of the more available charge hasbeen removed and the needle doesn’t read and just F/Ns. However on two cans you can get reads on BTsand clusters that didn’t read on a Solo can. This is because you are now dealing with BTs and clusters instates below unconscioiusness and stuck down the track.ODDITYA Pre-OT on NED for OTs may feel invalidated by the fact that he still sees pictures even thoughhe is not making pictures. The reason for this is because all BTs are picturemakers. A being can go belowmaking pictures and when it comes alive it starts making pictures again. This is the condition of most BTs.Hence, the phenomenon of the Pre-OT still seeing pictures even though he isn’t making pictures.The Pre-OT could be mystified unless this mechanism is understood.“EXTERIOR” PERCEPTIONDuring this RD, or even while running OT III, a Pre-OT will sometimes get what is apparently“exterior perception”. As a BT is blowing, and while the Pre-OT has an attention unit on the BT, therecan be a feedback of the BT’s perception to the Pre-OT. You may get the BT’s visio of the room orenvironment as the BT is leaving. This BT perception folds up quickly and ceases when the BT has blown.It is usually very brief and is quite different from OT perceptions (actual exterior perception). In fact tobegin with objects tend to look rather thin and flimsy to an OT when exterior, as the body acts as a sortof collector and magnifier of perceptions and sensations. Some Pre-OTs tend to invalidate their ownexterior perception because of this. But OT perception improves further up he line. It is necessary tohandle all BTs and clusters first though.BENIGN AND HELPFUL BTsMost BTs and clusters aren’t vicious or vengeful, they’re mostly benign, though misguided. Theyare not in fact of use or value to you, they only hold one back. Some are convinced that they are necessaryto the body or to the functioning of some part of te body, this is not so. Some think they are helpful or beinghelpful. Many are quite confused. Most are dormant and below unconsciousness, ad as these are awokenor activated you may feel anaten from them.As you progress through the RD your own abilities will increase.And the fewer BTs and clusters there are attached to your body the better off and more OT you willbecome.LRH:dm:kjmL.

The onlyreason why a cluster hangs together is such misconception.A thetan can have a misconception of time, by having a wrong date for an incident.Or he can conceive that a past picture is “now”. Or he can have two incidents switchedin time, and think the earlier incident is later, and think the later incident is earlier. Sucha misconception of time hangs it up and prevents a blow. And you can get a blow bystraightening out the time misconception.A misconception of place occurs when a thetan thinks something happened inlocation A, when it happened in location B. You can get a misconception of both timeand place. E.g. a cluster gets a recent heavy restimulation. They think the incident wasthe restim, they made a picture of the restim and think that’s where it occurred originally- think the cluster was formed at the time and place of the restimulation. So they have boththe time and place in error. This misconception of both time and place confuses them andhangs the cluster up.Misconception of identity. Thetan X thinks he was implanted in “Woof” (place) -but actually he’s copying the picture of somebody who was implanted in “Woof”. Hehangs up on the misconcption of identity (thinks he’s the other thetan), and misconceptionof event (thinks he was implanted when he wasn’t).The whole reason why a cluster stays one, is misconception of identity, time, place,form and event - which is why Date/Locate works. The cluster is hanging in a time andspace disorientation.That’s what louses a BT up, some sort of misconception of time, space, form andevent or beingness. That ties them up and they are hard to untangle and blow."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"386They can switch all over the place with identity: he thinks he’s thetan “A”, but he’sreally thetan “B” mocking up “A”, and that will cause a stress - that’s probably theanatomy of stress.From earlier research I found it takes two viewpoints to make a somatic. You don’tget a somatic on a primary concept - it has to be a secondary concept. That’s whyobjectives work, it gets the guy back to the primary viewpoint/primary concept, and thesomatic blows. Something is formed originally, then taking another viewpoint of it, it getsmore solid. You do objectives and the guy comes around to the original viewpoint andthe somatic as-ises. This is from earlier research and is expressed in terms of differentviewpoints, rather than different beings or different BTs.You can have a BT thinking he’s two beings. There’s an implant on the track thatdid this (“All is one.” “One is all.”) A BT can think he’s a cluster or can think he’s severalBTs. A cluster can think it’s an individual. All you have to do is weed the misconceptionout of it and it goes -BONGO! With misconceptions of identity, time, place, form andevent you get ridges because you can’t occupy the correct viewpoint to blow it. And whenyou do straighten out the misconception it blows. Obviously if it wasn’t a misconceptionit would blow.This is why wrong dates and wrong locates hang up, and why getting correct date,correct location, blows them.If you get several misconceptions it gets really tangled up. One we handled hadmore than one cluster, the earlier cluster thought it was the later cluster, and the latercluster thought it was the earlier cluster. The earlier cluster was from C.C. Implant aroundI Quad in the universe before this one (which is now in the Dark Horse nebula in Orion)so they thought their universe (location) had disappeared, they were lost in time and place.On top of that was some Power Processing and a wrong item from an out-list. It was prettytangled up. But they untangle on straightening out the misconceptions, and blow.“Only the truth will set you free”, but you have to know what is the truth of identity,time, place, form and event.L.

II, Inc Is.You can Date/Locate clusters and blow them off, but the auditor who does this hasgot to be a shark at D/Ling. It’s the moment the cluster was formed that you date, not whenthe cluster hits the individual. And Date/Locate is not always recommended on NED forOTs.COPIESYou’ve always got to handle copies. BTs will copy. Obsessive duplication is a BTcharacteristic. Maybe all that engrams are is excessive copying.The 3 - 10 days to destimulate rule; it’s not the incident that was restimulated thattakes 3 - 10 days to destimulate, it takes 3 - 10 days for all the copies and copying to fadeout.“Stress” is also a heavy button. You get a lot of copying of stress. So you handlethe original, then copies - somebody copying what was run.NEW TECHNIQUESThe fastest and best way of blowing BTs and clusters is by inspection.Acknowledgement is very effective. A lot can be blown with pure acknowledge-ment.Another way of blowing them is simply to sort of jolt them a bit earlier in time, and"},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"388then they run on forward and blow. You use a sort of impulse to move them a bit earlierin time. It blows them off a stuck point on the track.BLOWING BY INSPECTIONThere’s a trick in this - don’t look at the picture - look at and find the shape and massof the BT. If you see the picture, shift your attention to the shape and mass of the BT. Youdon’t have to see their pictures. They use pictures as a sort of misdirection. So youconcentrate on masses , not pictures. The technique is, you see a picture, trace it back tothe BT, i.e. “Whose picture?” and find the BT this way and it blows.A Pre-OT may have a somatic in one body part, being put there by a BT in anotherbody part. Say he has a somatic in his leg and you find the BT putting it there is in thehead and when you find the BT doing this, it blows. A BT can also be being a somatic- he is “pain in the arm”.BT PATTERNBTs do a “crush in, pull back” - it’s almost an attitude. It’s a sort of tense heavyphysical pull back. The basis is fear - they’ve been hit hard by something - causes theirtimidity - they pull back into solidity. It’s a “hide” phenomena and a “pull back in”pattern. This causes pressure, the pressure is caused by them pulling back in onthemselves, sort of like a thetan trying to duck. And when a BT is awakened itimmediately mocks up mass. Mass is produced by “out-of-valenceness”. He’s out ofvalence into the valence of an object or other things.MECHANISMThere is a mechanism of somebody being a body, who has valences of past bodiessuperimposed on the body. BTs and clusters go into valences of pictures and things too.These guys have been parked in time and gone into a total reviv, you can look down thetrack and wake them up.They do a lot of “on-ness” - stuck on things, as different from in things. They wenton and couldn’t get off.The NED time track (i.e. time track of Dianetic auditing on a Clear or above) iscomposed of BTs parked on the time track - not in PT - you look down the time track andwake them up. They are stuck on the track and they also have pictures of themselves stuckon the track.It is actually possible for a BT or cluster to be totally out of PT, by which is meant,it is physically parked in past time. A BT or cluster can also be in PT while thinking itis in the past and mock up a picture of the past and consider that that is PT. A BT or clustercan be parked in the past so thoroughly that its only concept of a future is a future fromthat past which is already long gone by - this is the phenomenon of future pictures; it isalso the cause of worry about the future, terror stomachs & fortune telling (visions anddreams).Another mechanism that frees some is the realization that some other BT is holdingthem in - and it’s the truth, BTs and clusters stick to other BTs and clusters."},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"389BLACK BTsSometimes a BT will put other BTs in front of him as a sort of protection. You geta black area covered by a white area in front of it. A BT in the black area is holding someother BTs in place in front of it as a sort of protection or shield. The way to handle thisis to blow the black BT who is holding the others in place, then the others come off easily.Otherwise if you try to blow the front ones first, nothing happens. If you encounter BTsnot blowing, suspect and check for a BT or cluster holding the others , and handle it first,then the others blow easily.You can get partial blows where the BT or cluster comes off the Pre-OT’s body butstays in the room, plastered on a wall or outside the room. These can push TA up untilblown fully. When they hang up it is because they still have a connecting string to the bodyor because they conceive some barrier they have hit is impenetrable. The handling is tocut the beam or push them through the barrier or simply repeat the process. What hasactually happened is that the mass of BTs contain amongst them one or more BTs, towhich they are stuck, which have not been handled.A BT or cluster can go into the valence of a person - a cluster can go into the valenceof a single beingness e.g. a person known to the Pre-OT in PT and there could be a “stuckpicture” of this person. It actually isn’t a picture as such, it is a complete mocked upidentity plus a mock up of the identity’s surroundings. This is very puzzling to the Pre-OT as it doesn’t blow as a picture. He is really looking at the copied beingness andcharacteristics of the person who isn’t there, but which is some BTs and clusters thinkingthey are the person and being the person. (This is discussed under the heading of “Ghosts”in the lst American ACC in Camden.) The Pre-OT feels haunted, seeing his ex-girlfriendin front of him or even hearing his mother talking to him with brand new dialogue. (Nearlyeverybody has a ghost if he looks.) It blows like any other BT or cluster but the Pre-OTwill be puzzled when looking around for who’s mocking it up when nobody is, except theghost itself. The way to handle is to move the cluster down the time track to a momentbefore it knew the person and it blows.The ideal method of blowing BTs and clusters is by inspection, you get intodifficulty blowing BTs and clusters when the session has gone too long, pc getting tired,or over-restimulation.Usually the further through the RD you get, the faster and easier they blow.However, you can hit what appears to be a bog point particularly if the Pre-OT is tired oryou overrun for several sessions; at such a point just keep on giving sessions and soonyou’ll get a session of massive blows and after that they will blow faster and easier thanever. At such a bog point you may have to resort to the “Thetan Hand” technique untilit’s handled, after which you can return to blowing by inspection or “What are you?”,“Who are you?”.L.

They can go into the valence of a person oranimal, some BTs go into the valence of molecules, minerals as well as cells. Some gointo the valence of objects. There’s a trick of getting them to shift valence. You find outwhat it is out of valence into and indicate it - this is done by simply asking them what theyare. Having found out what he or they have gone into the valence of, you acknowledgeit and ask them who they are and they generally blow off.————————Psychologists have an operation going of:(a) convincing people they are a brain (because they think),(b) convincing people they’re an animal (meaning they have no soul).This sticks BTs and clusters into the head (brain), and into the body, and invalidatesthat they are a being. So it pins the BTs and clusters in, into the body. (And if you ranon a psychologist, “you’re a brain”, “you’re an animal”, it would cave the psychologistin, because he has so many overts of doing this to others.)————————On the time track BTs were lied to and told they were being built into a body - theyhave nothing to do with the body track at all, except to sit in or on the body. They had"},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"391“model forms” and BTs were made to assume “model forms”. It’s another valence trick- they’re in the valence of a body, or part of a body, such as “torso”, “brain”, “arm”, etc.These aren’t vicious in attitude, they are benign but misguided. They feel they arenecessary to the body. They are sometimes stuck on the external perimeter of the body,2 - 3 feet out from the body, surrounding it.They are in the valence of something. They consider these safe valences or safebeingnesses. What does a BT consider safe to be in? It is one of the systems of “beingin”, protected and defended - be in the valence of something.There’s also a scarcity of forms, and a being becomes a form. They can also be asignificance, and try to be in a form.They can be a picture, or an unsafe picture - to remind one that “nothing is safe,because one might forget”. So a BT can be a picture, or part of a picture, or he can be beinga ridge, or being a problem, etc. A BT can be in the valence of anything at all.There are actually five steps to shifting valence - you find out what valence the BTis being and acknowledge it and ask “who he is?” - he will usually cognite “I’m me”, andblow.BTs think they are pictures, things, beings, body parts, objects, significances,somatics - they can be anything at all. If that is realized, they will tell the Pre-OT whatthey are and blow. The basic misconception when handled, flips them into own valence,and they blow - sometimes disintegrating explosively - with a succession of “I’m me”,“I’m me”, “I’m me”....sometimes they go out several hundred feet and explode violently.If the Pre-OT asks “What are you?” they’ll answer up “I’m (valence)”, and thenrealize they’re not (valence). There’s another action of acknowledgement - maybenobody has ever acked these beingnesses - because they’re so bizarre, so far out. Youmust acknowledge what the BT or cluster tells you they are.

There are only three situations under which it doesnot work at once. These are:(A) When you don’t get an answer.(B) They give you a significance or identity in answer to the Who are you? question.(C) The criminal type.(A) When you don’t get an answer:If you don’t get an answer, you may be talking to simply an energy mass put out bysome other BT or cluster, or they are really dead, then tell it to go a little bit earlier, joltit a little bit earlier with an intention or impulse and then it will run on through and blow.But if it’s a ridge, being put out by some other BT or cluster, just look behind theridge and address your actions to the BT or cluster behind the ridge and then you’ll getan answer.(B) They give you a significance or identity answer:If you ask “Who are you?” and get an answer which is an identity such as: “GeorgeSmith”, or “Willy the Red”; you simply acknowledge that answer and ask “Who are you?”again. Sometimes you may have to run back down the track through a whole chain of pastidentities, but if you persist the BT or cluster will eventually realize and say “I’m me” andblow.(C) The Criminal type: These may give a criminal response: “Yah, yah, I’m your nemesis, I’m going to eatyou up, that’s what I am” - it can get very confused because your next question is “Whoare you?” and they’re kind of telling you who they are. They haven’t answered theauditing question of what they are, they can’t conceive of it - they’re “a demon” orsomething, whatever they think they are. However if you persist, “Good” you say, “Whoare you?” You don’t persist in asking them “What they are?”, ignore the chatter, just say“Good” and ask “Who are you?” and they quite commonly don’t go on with thatperformance - they simply go silent and they say “I’m me” and they blow."},{"pageNumber":393,"pageContent":"393NULLSBTs and clusters who are so dead and unresponsive that you can’t get any responsefrom them at all, no response, can be woken up by having the Pre-OT run “Hellos andOKs” on them. This will put them into communication and they can then be handled withthe Valence questions.Generally they’re very fluent and quite easy to handle, though. Probably whatmakes a preclear as a whole hard to audit at lower levels, is that you’re auditing all of thesemisconceptions simultaneously. But on NED for OTs you will find the majority of BTsand clusters easy to handle and blow. Many of them simply blow on inspection, and thebasic usual technique for blowing the rest of them is the Valence Technique.VALENCE TECHNIQUE1. “What are you?”2. (answer)3. Acknowledge4. Realizes it isn’t ( ________ ), and blows, or5. “Who are you?” - “I’m me”, and blows.6. If they repeat what they just said ask “What were you before you became that?”,they say “me” and blow.Those steps above are the basic and most workable technique. If the Pre-OT realizesthat a BT or cluster can be being anything - anything at all - and accepts the BT’s orcluster’s answer and acknowledges that answer, this technique will work very smoothlyand well.L.

So now in trying to audit “A”, you’re auditing “B”, buthe’s not there. It’s the general cross-influence - somebody copies a picture, somebodycopies a copy. It’s all on the basis of the misconception that “All is one” and they can’ttell whose picture is whose, or whose somatic is whose. You’re basically trying tountangle this mish-mash. And what’s amazing is that there are as many life beings as thereare - there are lots of them.In this RD, you’re handling for the main part, Dormant BTs, so it’s different that OTIII. These are beings that wouldn’t even run on OT III. On OT III or OT III Expandedyou run those beings that can be run on the track. Because they do have some incidentsin common, if you run the wrong one, it doesn’t matter too much, you’ll run the right oneanyhow.NED for OTs untangles the mish-mash and the cross-influences. You see them allthe time on people in a behaviour or life basis. The old time faith healers themselves pickup the somatics from the patient. One time I did an emergency assist - I asked a pc - herfeet were killing her and there was nothing wrong with her shoes - I asked “Whose feetare they?” - she said “My sister’s” and that was the end of the sore feet!Because of the number of beings it can get quite complex. It all starts out originallywith a thetan obsessively copying the physical universe around him. And when he startsdoing that, he sets himself up for copying other beings’ universes and then he gets prettyconfused. And the basis of it all is\"misconception\". First and foremost is\"misconceptionof identity\". That’s actually what the RD is structured on (it’s not structured on “he’s got"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"395BTs, so blow off the BTs”) it’s structured on the disentanglement of confusions. This RDhandles the entanglement of the BTs.This RD runs best short sessioned, because the restim then has a chance to key outbetween sessions. And you’ve always got the 3 - 10 days key-out on your side.You could call it the “Misconception RD” or the “I-am-you RD” or the “All-are-oneRD”! This RD proves very conclusively that all beings are separate individuals, becausethe only thing that gets them into trouble, is a loss of their own identity - misownershipof identity. They are definitely individual and separate beings. The Greeks got into a lotof trouble believing they were all part of Zeus. There must be other implants on the tracktoo that give them this idea. But it is now proven by this RD that people are individuals,so are BTs.The only thing that forms a cluster, is a misapprehension, agreement and sharedexperience. They are under the misapprehension that they are one being. What hangs ittogether is similarity of identity. This is the A = A that forms a cluster. Because they havegot the same picture, they must be the same person!Those are the basic philosophical concepts back of the RD, and they have never beentackled head on before!For example, a misconception - “I am Mamie Glutz”. How many crazy people inan institution think they are Napoleon? - some misconception! Sanity is the ability torecognize differences, similarities and identities - so misconception adds up to insanity. “Misconception” is the key to any trouble a being gets into. This can be any errorof matter, energy, space, time, form, identity or idea, believed by the individual to be fact.By untangling this, NED for OTs produces some astonishing results.L.

That’sthe end of III.But Planet Earth was a dumping ground to end all dumping grounds. Actually the end of OT III iswhen those BTs and clusters which can be gotten into communication easily and can be made to run IncidentIIs and Incident Is are gone. It’s not when all BTs in the whole universe that ever will be are gone.DORMANT BTsYou can wake up very dormant BTs and clusters that actually you’ve never hit on OT III - neverdreamed they existed.Many are not visible in PT. These dormant ones are not squarely in the time stream, they’re downthe track a bit. You shift your attention and pull them into PT, or your attention goes a bit out of PT andthere they are. They are not precisely in the time stream. This solves the mystery of how an OT III can seenone, get run on some NED and it kicks them in.It is like a whole being reviv. Dormant BTs and clusters are stuck down the track in an incident.Dormant BTs are out of PT in denyer chains (like “not there”, “can’t be there”), so they “don’t exist”, yetthey do exist. If you look down the track, there they are, and if you ball them up with engram running orbad auditing, you get real trouble, as they recoil against the body.PRE-OT’S PERCEPTIONSome Pre-OT’s perception is not up to perceiving BTs and clusters and masses. Unless you raisedtheir perception you would miss on this Rundown. The preliminary action of “NED for OTs” is designedto raise the Pre-OT’s perception to a point where he can perceive BTs and clusters and other beings’pictures, and this step is vital to this RD.L.

You check“Past auditing” first, and if it’s not reading, no pc interest, you skip it. But if later in theRundown you run into a bog, TA goes high, or any kind of grind or mess up, you recheckpast auditing, and handle. Repair of engram running is limited to simply indication. Youmustn’t get into continuing to run the engram or you’ll be running engrams on a Clear,as you aren’t running them on a Clear and aren’t repairing them on a Clear, you arerepairing them on a BT.THE BUG ON NED FOR OTsIf you get a wrong item on somebody they will now have that item - it persists; e.g.you run “sore toe” on somebody who doesn’t have one, they’ll end up with a sore toe! Ifyou now try to handle sore toe with auditing it will worsen. Because it was a wrong itemin the first place. You have to repair the wrong item. A BT could be run on a non-existentsomatic, and to be obliging mocked it up. They can get run on imaginary incidents andon things that are not their track so what was run could have been false.If the pc was run on an unreading item, BTs will be activated, but they don’t havethat item either. It’s a false assumption there was something there to run - that’s theirmisconception foisted off on them by being given the belief that the item existed or read.When called on to run something, they will furnish copies, misowned and manufactureditems. You need to check for BTs run on wrong items, unreading items and sort it out.Some BTs went exterior and were audited past it. Some BTs had already gone Clear- not just oin the Clearing Course - some went Clear on Objectives. So you don’t just haveDianetic auditing on somebody after Clear. You also have Dianetic auditing on BTs afterthey went Clear! Resulting in invalidation of he State of Clear, the mistake of misowningothers’ pictures, and then misidentification of identity. NED auditing after Clear appliesto BTs as well as Pre-OTs. So there are residual BTs with invalidated erasure, invalidatedClearing. And the originally overrun thetan may have blown and left copies of theoverrun."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"398Grinding an incident on Dianetics or NED will result in some BTs run past erasure,so they have to mock it up again to run. Or they never got to basic and erasure becausethe auditor never asked for E/Beg or E/Sim, and were left hanging incomplete on thechain. And other BTs will copy all this obsessively.Out L & N lists and wrong items will do the same thing, and also can be repaired.Auditor command flubs, lack of acknowledgement, couldn’t hear the auditor,session distractions - all these will hand up BTs. Even false dates could be copied - theycan be twice removed from reality. In trying to date something now you could wind updating the wrong date, or dating the date that the wrong date was given. And it might nothave been that BT’s or cluster’s incident that was being dated in the first place - theincident may have been misowned - not their incident.YOU CAN’T RUN NED FOR OTs ON SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN RUN ONWRONG OR UNREADING ITEMS WITHOUT REPAIRING THEM.Also beware of getting into over-correction, because what you are correcting on oneBT, can start uncorrecting on another BT.So you check ”past auditing” for read and \"interes\" \"as the first step. If it reads andPre-OT is interested you handle it. If not, skip it, but be alert and if Pre-OT hits a bog yourecheck past auditing. Remember not to run anything, just indicate it.This doesn’t mean that all previous auditing was bad - far from it! But some auditorsdue to poor training, bad metering, or nasty habits will be found to have messed up cases.So you repair past auditing by auditors - by auditor’s name. (And also see that suchauditors are handled too.)That’s the bug on NED for OTs - you can collide with BTs and Clusters messed upin past auditing, and this can recoil heavily and physically upset the Pre-OT. So you keepthe Repair List andy and if you run into a bog, use the Repair List and next session C/Sto take up past auditing, remembering not to continue to run engrams but only indicate.REPAIRING PAST AUDITING BY AUDITOR’S NAMEMake a list of names of auditors and test these for read. Include self-auditing andsolo auditing too. Those that read, you repair the items run by that auditor, or in self-auditing. And make provision for occluded auditing. You may think you’ve got it all,only to find an occluded session or sessions spring to view later.This is why you must teach FESers to FES and make up FFTs, that include theauditor’s name.And that’s why the Advanced Courses Specialist Auditor must know what he’sdoing in training to deliver this Rundown. It’s not a piece of cake.Do it flawlessly and produce the spectacular results the Rundown is capable of.LRH:dm:kjmL. RON HUBBARDCopyright (c) 1978FOUNDERby L.

Allow for the possibility of occluded auditing showingup later as charge is taken off during this repair.Assess the list of auditor names, including self-auditing and Solo auditing, for readand note size of read. Start with the largest reading, and repair the items run by that auditoras follows:1. Take the Dianetic item that was run, e.g. “Pain in the Zorch”, and test it for read.(If no read, skip it.).2. Find the error in running. Such as: “Unreading item”, “Wrong item”, “No suchitem ever existed”, “Run past erasure”, etc. (Usually the Pre-OT will be able to get this.If not the auditor can find out quickly by meter.).3. Indicate the BPC found. (ONLY indicate, do not start running anything.)4. “Is the BT or cluster this was run on still around?” (And note whether this reads,it won’t read if the BT or cluster has already blown.)Have the Pre-OT find the BT or cluster by position on the body - sometimes the BTor cluster will blow on inspection on this step alone; if it doesn’t,5. Blow the BT or cluster.6. Copies. The auditor asks “Copy?” and if reading has any copies spotted andblown.

You must also be alert for what you arecorrecting on one BT or cluster uncorrecting on another BT or cluster; e.g. “Overrun” maybe correct for one, but not correct for another. You can check for this and if so, indicatethat “Overrun” did not apply to the rest.Step 2 above - Finding the error - may go earlier similar, the same BT or cluster mayave been mis-audited in an even earlier session or sessions, and these too may need to berepaired.

There will havebeen considerable cross-copying. Do not attempt to R3R or R3RA such a session. Handleit as described above under Repairing Past Auditing. Repeat those steps until all BTs andclusters have been blown off that session.PAST MIS-METERING, MIS-DATING OR LOCATINGIf the Pre-OT has been mis-metered in the past this may need to be repaired.Meter evaluation by which is meant the auditor keeps telling the pc that this or thatdidn’t read, etc., can be highly evaluative and invalidative, especially when that auditorwas mis-reading the meter. The pc was left hung up in things that did read, but weren’ttaken up, and when things that didn’t read are taken up, it will stir up dormant BTs andclusters, and misownership and misidentification occurs. Add to that cross-copying ofBT pictures and you get a mess that can recoil very heavily against the Pre-OT’s body,dangerously so.Meter evaluation can be repaired by getting off when the pc or Pre-OT was toldsomething read when it didn’t,and vice versa. And handling “Evaluation?” E/Sim to F/N.Mis-dating and partial locating is similarly corrected by getting off any wronglocations that were given or locations that were wrong for other BTs or clusters.Note that on Dating and Locating you can get a build up of mass and pressure, evena protest ridge, due to the date for one BT or cluster being the wrong date for some otherBT or cluster. The mass and pressure will blow on indication that it was a wrong date orwrong location for them.

Some think theycan’t go in - because they think they can’t go through solids - so they “Went on”, plasteredon (to something).Another way to blow them is to scan them back to when they went in - and they blowout. Like a plus/minus reaction, “Went in” - blow out.A BT with Out-Int affects its ability to blow - not the Pre-OT’s ability to blow themoff - the BT’s ability to blow. You scan them down a chain of “Went ins” to the first “Wentin” and it will blow.You could handle a very difficult one by recalling “times they went in” - for verydifficult ones. A fast way to blow them would be to get them to scan back through “Wentins” - “When did you go in?” - and they blow.ON-NESSThere’s also “Went on”, “Went onto something”, and a lot are stuck on something.You scan them back through times when they “Went on”. They went onto something andcouldn’t get off.Sometimes a BT will blow from inside the body and catch on the outside of the body,or within 2 - 3 feet of the body. You can get too many restimulated on the surface of the"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"405body. You have to blow off these surface ones.Being stuck on the surface of something would have something to do with the button“Can’t go in” for a BT, and that button produces blows. BTs who “can’t go in” tosomething, “Went on”, and stuck.“On-ness” is different from Out-Int. They are stuck on, not in.“On-ness” is handled in the same way as Out-Int but with “Went on” or “Got on”.The “earlier than” phenomenon applies to “ON”, as one has to first get on somethingbefore he gets off. Trying to persuade a stuck “Went on” BT or mass to get off,can runinto the same phenomenon as Out-Int and he won’t blow. Handle it the same way as“Went in” but with the difference of “Went on”. One could in theory find a thetan whowas “stuck on”, handle that and then find that the same being had Out-Int.OUT-INTSometimes BTs have Out-Int because they can’t get out or couldn’t get out.They arein the valence of something that can’t be out, even fatal to be out, e.g. “the inside of body”or an internal organ. They consider these safe beingnesses, and it’s safe to be in. So youask “What couldn’t get out?” and they blow.If you ask them to point which way is in, they can’t. Getting them to point whichway was in works, and produces blows. Use the past tense,”Which way was in?” and theywill blow.RECURRING INT TROUBLEIf a Pre-OT on NED for OTs has recurring Int trouble or continues to run into Out-Int, and you can’t solve it easily, do the End of Endless Int Repair Rundown (assessingand handling Int buttons by Recall, not R3RA).

How could a being get stuck to a body? There’ssome kind of central core in the body that the being mistakes for the body. The central core sticks to thebody and the thetan sticks to it. Some BTs think they are a body. There are clusters that think they’re abody and other BTs stick to the cluster and wind up thinking they’re a body. They would have to be stuckby a postulate: “I am a body”, or “I am a head”, or “I am the brain”, etc.Someone on OT III can think he’s complete on OT III because he thinks the solidity he perceivesas the body is the body. It is a mistaken apparency of solidity of the body. This apparent solidity of thebody is composed of BTs and clusters and may be the same size and shape as the body when first contacted.So someone on OT III perceives this and assumes it’s the body and thinks he’s done on OT III. This“solidity” he perceives as the body is composed of BTs and clusters. The body becomes transparent toan OT to the degree he clears this up. It is a “body” built of thetans - you have to learn you’re not lookingat the body, but a false body composed of BTs and clusters. A Pre-OT on “NED for OTs” will becomeaware of this during the RD (it is not drawn to his attention by the auditor). It’s not the solidity of the bodybut the solidity of BTs and clusters formed as a body.The body acts as a magnifier of perceptions - it collects and magnifies perceptions - some thetansthink they can’t perceive well exterior, as the actual body and objects and walls look pretty flimsy andtransparent to an OT.The guy gets fooled - he thinks he’s looking at this body and he’s not. He’s looking at a solid massof BTs and clusters. The actual body looks transparent to an OT. Unless you get the guy’s perception up,he won’t be able to perceive this and if he can’t perceive them, he won’t be able to run them. Thepreliminary step of “NED for OTs” is to get the Pre-OT’s perception up enough so it can be run. This false“body” composed of BTs and clusters is blown off piece by piece on the RD.COMPOSITE MASSESA composite mass such as the false “body” composed of BTs and clusters needs to be handled orblown off in pieces. You could make the mistake of trying to blow it all at once instead of piecemeal. Youmay also encounter “layered clusters”, which is layers of clusters on top of each other.Use the “thetan hand” technique to separate ridges and masses, (you can split ridges apart andseparate masses and clusters by passing a “thetan hand” between them). Then blow off the BTs andclusters spearately. You can look up and down inside a mass, rather than outside it and it starts to go.There are so many BTs and clusters that the Pre-OT can wonder if he’s pulling in any that weren’tthere before or wonder if all space is full of them-that isn’t so, it only seems that way.L.

It’s the BT’s visio feeding back to you while the BT is blowing.This visio folds up when the BT has blown and your attention is off it. It’s not your own exteriorview, it’s their exterior view as they’re blowing and it fades as they blow and your attention comesoff them.It’s to do with viewpoints and attention - if you get one of your viewpoints (attention unit)in one (a BT or cluster), it will carry it and you sort of see through their perception - it’s how yousee their pictures and why you get some of their visio as they blow.It has also been noted that when you do get a feedback visio from a “BT” as it blows, thatit is actually not a single BT, but two or three and the feedback is coming from another or otherBTs who have not cognited that he is himself. In other words it is an uncleared BT or cluster whois carrying this visio anchor point away.Not all exterior perception comes from BTs though. The Pre-OT can also get an exteriorview which is his own actual exterior perception. If the Pre-OT gets a stuck or fixed exterior view,it is easily handled by having the Pre-OT look the other way, i.e. look in the opposite direction,and the fixed direction of view, will unfix. It is easy to differentiate between actual exteriorperception of Pre-OT and the phenoomena of the Exterior view of a BT during a blow, bychecking on the meter. If it is the view of a BT partially blown, it will read as such. Partially blownBTs should be handled to complete blow at which point the relayed BT visio will cease.There is a positive way to handle this if it hangs up. This is for the Pre-OT to extend hisattention out to the point to which the BT or cluster has blown and ask it again what it is, giveit an ack, and then ask who it is. The untouched or uncleared BT or cluster that is being carriedaway goes “poof” and the exterior visio ceases instantly.There’s also perception by tactile contact, when the BT is attached to the body.LRH:dm:kjmL.

ThePre-OT will get a realization similar to the Straightwire EP that he/she won’t get anyworse”. This isn’t the EP of the Rundown but shows progress is being made.During the Rundown the Pre-OT will become aware that what has been mistakenlyassumed to be the body, is not the actual body, but the solidity of BTs and clusters in shapeof the body. The Pre-OT may comment that his actual body or walls or objects look flimsyor transparent and this is actual OT or exterior perception, and become aware that he isperceiving BTs and clusters where the body looks or feels solid. He is perceiving thedifference between the false “solidity of the body” and the actual body. As this false“body” is audited out the clusters and masses remaining will swell to greater size, withless mass and solidity.Further through the Rundown, there are fewer BTs and clusters remaining, and themass expands and gets softer; it’s not under so much pressure. There’s less mass, and whatis left is less dense. And they blow easier and faster, with decreasing TA action.Toward the end of the Rundown there are less and less BTs and clusters to trap hisattention into the body and his attention goes out onto the physical environment. An OT’s"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"409attention can get so exteriorized, that it is very difficult to get his attention onto the body;his attention is on the walls, room, building, area or planet. The meter will read on “wall”or “room”, etc., wherever his attention is. You can get a similar phenomenon of the OTgetting perception of a wall or environment, via a blowing BT. Or the BTs can getperception of physical environment via the OT’s body. This phenomenon is different, theOT is in direct communication and perception of the physical environment. (Meter readwill establish which it is.)In earlier research I discovered what we call “leaning on a wall”. The OT “leans”against an object in PT and feels it, and it can put a TA high; e.g. the being is leaningagainst a milk carton and gets a waxy cardboard feeling. Realization of what is going onhandles it. But the phenomenon encountered toward the end of NED for OTs is different.The OT’s attention becomes so exteriorized that he goes into direct comm with theenvironment and finds it hard to put his attention on the body. About this time BTs andclusters do not read well and the sensitivity has to be turned up high to get reads on BTs,and you have a pretty constantly F/Ning needle. The auditor needs to be sharp on TA andneedle handling to keep the needle on the dial and detect small reads on a very looseneedle. F/Ning TA becomes more frequent.Don’t try to push a session past a big win or marked case change; several of thesewill occur during the Rundown. It’s the EP for that session - not for the Rundown.It is possible for the Pre-OT later in the Rundown to blow a distant BT stuck tosomebody else. If the Pre-OT’s attention is drawn to something outside the sessionenvironment, check for a BT or cluster in the area where his attention fixes, and have thePre-OT blow it off. This action is effective and permanent.There are two changes going on during the Rundown:(a) Pre-OT as a thetan is getting “bigger” and stronger;(b) There are less BTs and clusters left.The Pre-OT will get more and more relaxed, less mass, less tension in the body. Atfirst on the Rundown these masses are very tense and hard, they feel like a tensed muscle,later the mass gets less and lighter and the body more relaxed.Toward the end of the Rundown the amount of mass left is so slight that after a fairlyshort session it can become unprofitable to audit as there’s so little left, and what can befound blows so fast and easily.These last few will blow by inspection and when there are none at all in the Pre-OTor his environment, then you’ve reached the end of the Rundown. The EP of the Rundownis when: the Pre-OT has a transparent body and a clear area around it to some distance(barring perception of other people’s difficulties) and when he realizes he is alive and verymuch himself.LRH:dm:kjmL.

If the session goes on too long youcan get some too restimulated to blow easily. This can build up pressure and push the TAup. It relieves on indication of cross-restimulation. BTs go into restim on other BTs’pictures.As the sessions are generally short, Tech Services and Tech Pages will have to bevery well organized and effective, so that no auditor time is lost waiting for next pc, orfolder. C/Ses and auditors will have to ensure that Executives in and above Tech Servicesknow and follow C/S Series 56 and BFO 46 VALUE OF SERVICES DELIVERED,HOW TO RAISE and cram them on these issues whenever lines or terminals drop out.The sessions are generally short and frequent. You must not continue a session pastthe session EP, usually an F/Ning TA, or a win. You must not go on past the session EPor get into grinding due to over-restimulation. Show this to your D of P if he tries to pushyou.There’s also a factor of “incomplete blows”. You can meter check for this, but don’tnag the Pre-OT on it, or you’ll stir more up because all the BTs remaining are sort ofincomplete blows!As you run “NED for OTs” there’s a certain amount of pressure or somaticremaining at session end. This becomes less from one session end to another.You can restimulate more in a session than you blow. This can be checked for onthe meter and handle those restimulated in the session but not blown.The session is usually started by 2WCing to F/N, or flying Ruds. But the auditormust realize that charge in restim comes from restimulated BTs and clusters. Shocks orstress in life restimulate BTs and clusters who then copy the restimulation, and this"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"411restimulation is a wrong incident for them as it is only a lock on whatever they are stuckin. You handle any out-Rud BTs or restimulated BTs at the beginning of session. If theTA is high, do not try to 2WC it down, or go off Pgm onto a C/S 53, check for and handleBTs or clusters in restimulation, or if there is evidence of Out-Int, check for and handleany BT or cluster with Out-Int first. Care must be taken at beginning of session not to askfor Earlier Similars that don’t exist, nor to restimulate more than is in restim. You’re onlytrying to get any out-Ruds or restim out of the way so you can get onto the Body of theSession.The Pre-OT probably shouldn’t watch movies or TV during this Rundown, as BTstend to make pictures of the movie and hang up in them, requiring handling at beginningof session. If too much restim occurs due to watching movies or TV, get the Pre-OT tostop watching them during the Rundown.I had earlier found that Vitamin Bl would turn off dreams or nightmares and that alack of Vitamin Bl would make a pc more susceptible to having dreams or nightmares.Apparently lack of Bl makes BTs stick to bone structure, more susceptible to restimulation,and harder to blow. A session done on a Pre-OT who had a Bl deficiency ran very slowlywith great difficulty blowing BTs and clusters. The session was very “gluey”. TakingVitamin Bl resolved this and BTs and clusters became easy to blow again. Pre-OTs onNED for OTs should take 500 Milligrams of Vitamin Bl (Thiamine Hydrochloride) daily,and if they experience dreams, nightmares, or difficulties blowing BTs and clusters, thenthe dosage should be increased.A right date or location for one BT or cluster can act as a “wrong date” or “wronglocation” for another BT or cluster, as it isn’t correct for their incident, and pressure andmass can build up on this during a session where Date/Locating is done. Meter check for“wrong date?”, “wrong location?”. Indication of this when it has occurred will relieve thepressure and blow the TA down. BTs can also build up a protest ridge on this.Generally the TA will move in a pumping action, BDing as BTs and clusters blow.The general session pattern is for the TA range to get higher and higher and then pumpon down to lower range, which is the ideal point for ending session. A session continuedpast this resulted in cross-restimulation and difficulty in blowing BTs.The session must be well ended, as you are ending the session for others (BTs andclusters) - not just for the Pre-OT. “END OF SESSION” given Tone 40, may have to berepeated to ensure the session is in fact ended. You will also sometimes encounter “lastcall” BTs and clusters. Just as you are about to end the session, some BT or cluster maypop up to be handled - this will often occur on “Say or ask?” - let the Pre-OT handle anysuch “last call” BT or cluster. To handle restimulation accumulated in the session, youcan tell BTs to “Come to present Time” before ending the session. Then end the sessionwell and thoroughly.A usual session EP is an F/Ning TA.L.

A Pre-OT can run out of readson a Solo can to a point where the needle just F/Ns, but on 2 cans reads will show. This is because youare dealing with dormant BTs and clusters, that are dead - even below unconsciousness and out of PT.They have to be activated, by Pre-OT’s attention.During the Rundown the sensitivity may have to be raised as there is getting to be less and less thereto impinge and read on the meter. This does not reflect the Pre-OT’s case state, just the amount left to run.F/Ns will become more and more frequent.During a session, the TA works up into a higher range and pumps back down to lower range again(the usual ending point for a session); e.g. TA at start of sesson = 2.5. During session TA works up to 3.7,then pumps back down to 2.5 and the session is ended off. Continuing past this point results in over-restimulation of remaining BTs and clusters.The TA moves with a “pumping” action, BDing on blows. The BD on a blow is not the impulseof the BT or cluster leaving, it’s the sudden decrease of resistance as the mass blows. The size of BD isrelative to the size of mass of the BT or cluster. When you put attention on them and start waking themup, there’s a sudden increase of mass. When they blow, there’s a sudden decrease of mass. This is whatregisters on TA and makes the TA pump up and down.The TA is an indicator of progress through the rundown - you will start getting a floating TA, atsome point, which will become more frequent. Do not continue a session past a sudden large BD to F/NingTA, just end off the session.Sometimes the Pre-OT will experience a continuous blow or continuous flow phenomena. Thishappens after the Pre-OT has blown a BT or cluster who was holding others in, then the rest will bloweasily, often in a continuous blow. This shows on the meter as continuous fall or slowly BDing TA. Laterit will show as a “BDing F/N” - the needle F/Ns while the TA falls, and this may go into an F/Ning TAand that is the EP for that session.A later prediction factor which shows progress through the RD, is a change of needle pattern. TheLFBD on a blow gets much faster, than before. This is not a bigger BD it is a faster fall and BD. The risesare faster too, so you have a needle moving at about two or three times the speed it was moving previously,and this speeding up of the needle can happen quite suddenly in the session, and is very noticeable.LRH:dm:kjmL.

Initial reads are oftensmall (due to small amount of charge remaining), and the Sensitivity has to be crankedway up to catch these reads. The way you do this is by handling the TA with index andsecond finger, and the Sensitivity knob with the thumb.Drill operating the TA and Sensitivity knob with E-Meter Drill #11 “Superlative TAhandling”, until you have mastered it.The total amount of TA action per session at this level is low. Usually around 1.0- 2.0 divisiions, rarely as high as 6.0 divisions.It does not compare with TA action at lower levels at all.An F/Ning TA is often the signal to end the session so how do you handle an F/NingTA?

You can have a guy totally reviv’d in time, he’s stuck downthe track in an incident which is PT for him. Anything which he views, is viewed fromthis point in time. It is when he is.A being can also be in a reviv in place or location. That is where he is. Everythinghe views is viewed from that location, that viewpoint in space. They’re “buttered all overthe universe”. A BT can think of himself as up there, looking down at himself. A totalwrong viewpoint. He’s in a reviv and everything he does is from a stuck viewpoint, sohe’s operating with a stuck spacial point of view. Say the guy is reviv’d in Flanders,everything he does is from the viewpoint in Flanders - even tries to look at himself (now)from Flanders. He’s operating in PT from some place down the track.THOUGHT DISASSOCIATIONThought disassociation follows a point of view pattern. In a reviv, they’re talkingto you from an altered point of view, so you get disassociated thought. Say he’s in a revivof lcoation, in a radar station in space. You ask him “Where are the books?” - he looksat a radar screen and says “They’re going away”.I know a case who had an accident. She thought she left the body and went to abetween lives implant and returned to the body. But there has been no between livesimplant in that place for eons! What happened is, she was reviv’d in a between livesimplant. She had the accident and went exterior, she thought she went to this betweenlives implant because that’s the location she was reviv’d in.This is a matter of old fixed viewpoints in spacial locations. You can often cure acase with the process “Where would you be safe?” He might go through a heavy reviv"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"415on the process and he might “do a bunk” - going back to his last point of view, location-wise. That point of view is still out there. That’s why D/L works. You blow that pointon Locate step. It’s when and where they are, as they’re not in PT.That is where he is “safe”, that’s Thought Disassociation, and that’s small pictures- because he’s in a picture, looking at a picture.These are the mechanics of the Bright Think Rundown (Disassociation process)which can be run on anybody. Running it is not part of NED for OTs as it is a separateRD.OBJECTIVE DUB-INThis is a different phenomenon from Thought Disassociation and spacial reviv.He looks at that wall, and because it’s not safe to look at the wall, he makes a pictureof the wall and brings the picture back to him and looks at the picture of the wall. He’sso far south he can’t confront anything that’s in front of him. You tell him to look at thewindow, he sort of reaches out to the window with a beam or something, makes a pictureof it, and pulls the picture back up to him, looks at it and tells you the window has barson it. This case requires objectives until it’s safe to look at something and perceive it.L. RON HUBBARDFOUNDERLRH:dm:kjmCopyright (c) 1978by L.

He’s “not there”, and then whenattention is put on him he acquires mass. He’s in some artificial valence (which producesmass). When some recognition is granted him, he goes in valence and blows. There’s aridge when a thetan feels under attack, or maybe unacked - first reaction is to stop, so hemocks up mass.A BT sitting around or on a nerve channel, who is awakened and suddenly mocksup mass or a ridge, will shut down the nerve and knock the guy anaten - knocks the bodyanaten - not the pc. In the head especially, when a cluster suddenly mocks up mass, it shutsoff nerve channels.Some people who are deaf or blind might simply have a cluster sitting on a nerve,and it’s gone on so many years the nerve atrophies. Catatonics may be suffering from thissort of knockout. This explains why a tactile process works - you run tactile on the bed,etc, after an accident and the guy comes out of it.Another source of anaten is a being exuding anaten - he can be a piece of anaten -and he also exudes anaten, and beings around him go anaten. It is a feeling - anunconsciousness feeling.Cluster A going into anaten, then influences cluster B, and then cluster B comes uptone into unconsciousness, and you get anaten. These clusters exist as solidities waybelow unconsciousness, and on III don’t respond at all. Both phenomena above produceanaten.“SOMETHING THAT ISN’T THERE”It’s also possible to run into a BT thinking he is “negative mass” and cutting offperception or sensation in an area."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"417Occasionally you may run into some BTs hanging together in a mocked up vacuum.Some BTs have a “something that isn’t there”. They were withdrawing fromsomething, but there was nothing there. It’s either suppressed out of existence or ithappened once and they stuck in the pattern of withdrawing; they can even justify andthink ther’s something they’re withdrawing from. They put something there to withdrawfrom - a negative mockup. Or they think another BT is putting something there, that isn’tthere.SOMATICSSometimes they blow and a somatic turns on - two beings crunched together and atthe point of “crunch”, they get a somatic.It takes a multiple mass to create a somatic. Whether it’s a number of BTs orclusters, the somatic mechanism is mass versus mass, not cluster versus body, but clustervs. cluster, or BT vs. BT, or BTs and clusters vs. BTs and clusters, or cluster vs. clusterwith a BT squashed in the middle. The cluster vs. cluster somatic is more severe than asomatic in a picture (incident) - unless he were totally revivified in the incident. You canalso postulate a somatic, but that’s different.L.

There are BTs in the energy ridgeleft behind by another BT.There’s a basic mechanism, some BTs make ridges and masses and other BTs comeand cling to that and get stuck and they think they’re part of it and they maintain it - afterthe original BT has blown. You have to look through the ridge and find who’s in it - afteryou’ve blown the BT who made the ridge. You not only look for the BTs that made theridge, but also the BTs stuck in it, and keeping it there, and the ridge doesn’t fully blowuntil both mechanisms are handled.A BT could mock up a pole trap and another BT come along and stick to it. Youblow the 1st BT and still have the pole trap, which is being kept there by the BT who stuckin it. So you ask “What are you?”, Ack, “Who are you?” and blow BT who was stuck toit. The whole body is a trap because it’s BTs getting stuck to BTs.You blow the thetan mocking it up first and it tends to evaporate, but you then haveto handle the others.They will actually create anything in sight - low havingness - obsessive havingnessor holding on to the familiar.L.

The Pre-OT’sperception hangs up on BTS and clusters. These BTs and clusters have the ability tochange and control a thetan’s perception whereas Mest won’t. BTs and clusters are tooclose to a thetan’s wavelength and can therefore exert control. A primary target for NEDfor OTs is: “things that are not part of the biological machine (body), but think they areand get in the way.” This is what you want to handle. The Pre-OT’s sight hangs up onthese BT/cluster masses. The successive steps of the Rundown have to do with the partsof the body he can see, the phenomena encountered and the processes you handle thesewith. The actual criterion the auditor uses is What is the Pre-OT looking at? What canhe see? and Can he blow it?The ideal scene: “A transparent body which does not interfere with the sight of thethetan and is free from unwanted sensations, pains, or pressures.” The primary error athetan makes is mistaking these BT/cluster masses for the body or mistaking another’spictures as his own. The procedure has a cyclic pattern of getting rid of the obvious ones,then dead or unresponsive ones, then obvious ones, over and over. You are liable to runinto any of these manifestations at any time and need to know the processes which handle.1.HANDLING WHAT THE PRE-OT’S ATTENTION IS ON(Establish this by folder or by D of P interview or both.

Mainly determined by the question, What is the Pre-OT’s attention on?and, What is his attention avoiding? - care must be used with the later, not tothrow the Pre-OT in over his head.)2.INDOCTRINATION STEPThis consists of clearing definitions of MisUs in OT III materials, clearingdefinitions of terms used in NED for OTs, reading the basic theory issues ofNED for OTs, and indoctrination in the basic technique of the Rundown. It isa mandatory step.3.PERCEPTION STEPThis is an optional step, done if the Pre-OT’s perception is not up to perceivingmental masses, an ability necessary to this Rundown. It could be tested assimply as asking the Pre-OT to close his eyes and tell you if he can see throughthe head or the body. It is only done in order to get him able to perceive mentalmasses(BTs and clusters), which is the EP of this step.4.PAST AUDITING(This step is done if “Past Auditing” reads and Pre-OT is interested. If not,don’t take it up. If not taken up at this point be alert for Pre-OT colliding withBTs and clusters hung up in past auditing at a later point during the Rundownand if there is a bog check for and handle past auditing.)4A.D/L the point when Pre-OT went Clear, and handle mis ownership of picturesby Pre-OT.4B.Handle BTs who went Clear and were audited on engrams, mistaking other’spictures as their own and resulting in invalidation of their State of Clear.4C.BTs who went Exterior and were prevented from blowing or audited pastExterior.4D.BTs audited past erasure resulting in invalidation of erasure.4E.Copies of any of the above, including the situation where the original BT hasblown leaving behind a BT who copied the overrun, etc.4F.Repair of Past Auditing by Assessment of Names of Auditors, including Soloauditing and self-auditing."},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"4274G.Repair of Wrong Dates, Wrong Locations, including any partially or wronglydated or located cluster. (Note that a right date or location for one, will bewrong for those remaining.)(NB: Do not overdo this step as auditing is late on the track, and is not thebasic for BTs and clusters. Past Auditing has to be repaired to the degree thatit gets in the way of doing anything else on NED for OTs. If you tried to handleall the auditing there had ever been on the case you could go on forever. Youmay run into some BT who’s been misaudited when doing later steps, butRepair of Past Auditing is done to a point where Pre-OT is happy with it, andit isn’t getting in the road of NED for OTs. The danger of handling too muchpast auditing is cross-restimulation.)Phenomena you are likely to encounter on Past Auditing step:*Dormant BTs woken up by Dianetic or NED auditing.*A Shell BT.*Body itself being a “magnet” for BTs/clusters due to a dietary ormineral or vitamin deficiency.*Misownership of pictures and of incidents.*BTs in valences.*Copying of current or recent stress or shocks,between sessionrestimulation.*BTs with Out-Int.*BTs who are stuck ON*BTs/clusters stuck down the track or out of PT.*BTs/clusters jammed together by rough auditing or misdating*BTs/clusters with an intention or goal opposed to auditing.*Over-correction, i.e. what is being corrected on one is “uncorrecting”on another.Cognitions or EPs encountered on Past Auditing step:*Realization that pictures are BTs’ or clusters’ and not the Pre-OT’s,with a confirmation of Pre-OT’s State of Clear, and the clearing up ofattendant mysteries.*Relief from BPC and somatics.*Realization like the S/W EP of “I’m not going to get any worse”."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":"4285.MASS MISTAKEN FOR THE MASS OF THE BODY(The primary error a Pre-OT makes is in thinking that the mass or solidity orsensation he/she experiences is the body.)The action taken on this step is to have the Pre-OT look at his body and spotmasses that are not the body and blow these either by inspection, or by thevarious techniques.Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this step:*Facsimiles of a body or bodies superimposed over the body.*An impaction of pictures.*A BT with an overt on other BTs or cluster, e.g. having made them intoa cluster.*Getting misdirected by the picture or mass the BT puts up - the Pre-OTneeds to be taught to shift attention from the picture or mass to the BTor cluster.*BTs or clusters stuck on the surface, i.e. BTs who WENT ON.*BTs who think they are a body or think they are necessary to the runningof a body.*Central core of BTs/clusters that other BTs and clusters are sticking to.Cognitions or EPs Encountered on “False” Body step:*Realization that the body is transparent or translucent to an OT and thatthe mass perceived is not the body.*Somatic relief and lessening mass.*False exterior perception caused by the Pre-OT’s attention being pulledout by BTs as they aredeparting.*Realization that BTs think they are pinned to the body, but are actuallypinned to other BTs and clusters.*Body getting less tense and mass expanding and getting less rigid.6.BTs/CLUSTERS BEING BODY PARTSThis step directly addresses BTs or clusters who are being body parts such as“a hand”, “a foot”, etc. The Pre-OT should be asked to look at a part of hisbody and see if it is solid and then blow the solidity by inspection or by varioustechniques. Body parts can be called off by the auditor and, those that read,handled."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":"429Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this step:*BTs and clusters being “a hand”, “a brain”, etc.*BTs and clusters who think they can’t leave as they think they areindispensible to the functioning of the body.*BTs and clusters being “negative” mass, invisible,being “model forms”,in the valence of body parts (i.e. terminals) and BTs/clusters being bodyconditions (i.e. unconsciousness, or a “broken leg”).*BTs/clusters sitting on a nerve channel and shutting off perception orcausing anaten, and BTs/clusters exuding anaten.*Composite masses that need to be split up by using the “thetan hand”technique and then blown piece by piece.*BTs/clusters being “a no hand” or “a no leg”.*BTs/clusters holding other BTs and clusters in.*Somatics caused by BTs and clusters locked together i.e. BT vs BT orcluster vs cluster.*BTs/clusters being in the valence of anything.*BTs/clusters going into the valence of a person in PT.*BTs/clusters holding other BTs/clusters in front as a shield.*PTS BTs who have had one SP in common - over several lifetimes.*BTs/clusters transferred from another person to Pre-OT’s body, e.g.BTs from his grandmother, etc.*BTs/clusters being an illness or aberration or an accident (Pneumonia,wound, car wreck, etc. - they are also in the valence of a picture of it).*BTs/clusters being significances (tired, anemesis, etc.).*BTs/clusters being ideas or identities that are ideas (a Christian Scien-tist, insanity, “go to town”, etc.).*Plural identity (an “us”).*One that thinks it’s many, and many who think they’re one.Cognitions or EPs Encountered on “Body Parts” step:*Less pressure and restimulation, becoming more noticeable at sessionend and from one session end to another.*Blows getting easier and faster."},{"pageNumber":430,"pageContent":"430*Looks like the number is infinite and you’ll never get rid of them as theyjust keep popping up but realizing that it isn’t really this way and thatprogress is being made.*A case change of Extroverted Attention, i.e. Pre-OT’s attention extro-verted and on the environment.7.BTs/CLUSTERS ON OR AROUND THE BODYThis step is run generally with the Pre-OT finding and blowing BTs andclusters as he encounters them. This includes BTs and clusters that are on thebody, inches from the body, feet from the body, yards from the body, or wayoff - all of these in which the auditor is interested are connected to and areinfluencing the body. One is not interested in other people’s BTs or clustersbut only those directly influencing the Pre-OT’s body. Because the Pre-OT’s“attention distance” has increased by the time you get to this step, this isrelatively easy to do. The auditor of course is not interested in using this onePre-OT to clear the planet but should not object too strenuously if the Pre-OTengages in some side actions that do not directly concern him, but realize thatthis is not this step or any other step. Care must be taken to ensure that onlyone mass or area or category is restimulated and fully handled beforeactivating another. The caution from OT III pack about not using too widean attention span applies here.Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this step:*Misidentified BTs and clusters who have copied each others’ incidentsand implants.*BTs/clusters switched in time (misconception).*BTs/clusters switched in location (misconception).*Remote BTs, i.e. stuck on another person or in another location wherePre-OT’s attention is fixed or drawn to.*BTs/clusters with “something that isn’t there”.*Multiple masses creating somatics.*Invisible, Secret, and Hiding BTs and clusters.*Hypnotized BTs and somnolent BTs and clusters.*BTs mocking up things they think they area.*Old Between Lives areas, remote implant stations of the past.*BTs/clusters who, being stuck in the past and look-forward, think theyare looking at the future.Cognitions or EPs Encountered on this step:"},{"pageNumber":431,"pageContent":"431*Body getting lighter, more relaxed and more in control. Much less massaround.*Realization that BTs/clusters were causing body shape distortions andthat body is “moving back into position”.8.GENERALLY SPOTTING AND BLOWING BTs AND CLUSTERSThis step consists of having Pre-OT locate and blow any BT or clusters thatare visible or perceivable, including handling any BTs or clusters restimulated.This is based on the old maxim that “If you get enough charge off . . . or if youkeep on getting charge off, you will make case gain and an entrance to the casewill show up”.You are likely to encounter any of the phenomena or manifestations of BTsand clusters. There is a general cyclic pattern of encountering BTs/clustersthat are hard to blow or that are holding other BTs/clusters,followed by aseries of easy blows, then the same pattern repeats over and over.9.REMNANT RIDGES (PARTIALLY BLOWN RIDGES, CLUSTERS)There is a mechanism of a BT or cluster making a ridge,then another BT orcluster comes along and sticks to the ridge. You blow the BT or cluster whomade the ridge first, then a remnant of the ridge remains containing BTs whostuck in it and are now keeping it there and you have to blow these off too -they generally blow easily. Another example of this is a BT being a pole trap.Another BT comes along and sticks to the pole trap. You first blow the BTbeing the pole trap and then you have to blow the BT who stuck to it.The auditor has the Pre-OT look for old ridges, remnants of ridges andmasses, and completes handling these to fully blown.Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this Step:*BTs/clusters left stuck in the ridge or picture that was mocked up byanother BT or cluster.*BTs/clusters being objects in another BT’s or cluster’s pictures. Sucha picture is hard to blow unless you recognize that the picture iscomposed of BTs being the parts of the picture.*“Hard core” BTs and clusters that are very hard to blow.*BTs/clusters with Out-Int.*BTs/clusters with stuck flows.*BTs stuck on the inside of a ridge who tried to blow but get caught bythe ridge. When you blow the ridge you find a lot of BTs blowing outfrom under the ridge."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"432*BTs and clusters being ridges.*Apparent inert masses that behave like ridges and have to be broughtto life with a “Hello - OK” technique.*Two BTs pushing so hard against each other that each one thinks thatit’s blocked by a ridge and to blow the ridge you have to blow the twoBTs.Cognitions or EPs Encountered on this step:*Body distortions clearing up.*Cognition of “I am well”.10.FLOW ASSESSMENT RECALL PROCESSThis process handles BTs and clusters with very stuck flows. It is run per theHCOB on it, to its EP.Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this step:*BTs/clusters unable to move on the time track because time itselfbecomes a stuck flow forward to them.*BTs/clusters who dive down the time track on a time stuck flow basis.*BTs/clusters who suddenly pop into view as they were in Revivs downthe time track and weren’t even in sight (which is what gives the Pre-OT theidea that it’s endless).*BTs/clusters (masses) who appear to be in PT (whose pressures are inPT) but who are really way down the track and who need only a smalljerk, given by the Pre-OT, to unstick them from the track.*The erroneous idea of the Pre-OT that he is in the past because he isbeing influenced by BTs and clusters that actually are in the past.*Fear of the future which is really a protest bringing about the apparencyof being stuck on he time track and that the time flow can actually sticksomeone.11.GENERALLY ADDRESSING THE BODY WITH NED FOR OTsThe auditor now has the Pre-OT look at the body and in particular any somaticarea or area of chronic somatics.Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this step:*False body parts, i.e. a false leg (BT or cluster being a false leg).*BTs/clusters transferred from another person who had such a physical"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"433condition, or BTs or clusters who copied such a condition.*BTs/clusters stuck in drugs or painkillers or anaesthetics used or takenin the body area.*Very small BTs that come up to tremendous size before blowing, somewith concept of “negative” space.*Heavy mass, unresponsive or inert BTs/clusters.*BTs stuck in body beingnesses, both body parts and body conditions.*BTs/clusters who are “making a body”.*Identityless BTs/clusters.*BTs/clusters that are Dead, that think they’re Mest, that think they aremolecules or planets.*A cluster causing a dislocated bone or trying to break a bone or spine,plus, the BTs or clusters being the damaged body part and holding ontothe damage or copying it.*BTs/clusters who are being broken legs, misformed arms, cancer,damaged brains, or other non-optimum body parts or conditions.*BTs or clusters operating on a refusal to make pictures - the negativeof obsessively mocking up.Cognitions or EPs Encountered on this step:*Extroversion EP for Session and F/Ning TA.*Awareness that anything perceived as mass or somatic in the body isnot the body, but comes from BTs/clusters.*Cognition re mocking up pictures due to loss of memory.*Actual Exterior perception of Pre-OT increasing.*Case change of reaching into body and finding nothing there (i.e. in anarea of body), and it being clean for the first time.*A cognition of personal identity - much more intense than previously.12.SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING CHRONIC SOMATIC AREAS OF BODYThis is a more specific address to any area of chronic or recurring somatic.Some chronic somatics depart very fast and don’t return. These are almostmiracle in nature. Other chronic somatics gradually lessen and can disappearin the course of the whole Rundown. So don’t despair if you don’t get aninstant alleviation of the chronic somatic but just keep on with the Rundownand don’t specialize in chronic somatics. Also be very cheered up when you"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"434hit an instant disappearance of one. Both conditions can exist in the same Pre-OT on different chronic somatics.Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this step:*An Aura - which is a whole package of BTs and clusters formed into theshape of a body and aura with other BTs and clusters stuck in it.*Very heavy anaten holding clusters glued together.*BTs and clusters in other parts of the body affecting the somatic area.*BTs and clusters in a very suppressed or compressed state that blow upto huge size and mass and surround and go through the whole body.**BTs and clusters behind, or on the other side_of, or inside , bones ororgans, or on the other side of a ridge - these are very likely to be missedas one wouldn’t think to look there.*Nulls or unresponsive BTs/clusters that are totally out of communica-tion and need to be put into Comm by running “Hellos and OKs” onthem.*A BT or cluster believing he is his own picture - or someone else’s.*BTs or clusters being “negatives” - i.e. a “no ___________” like a “nostomach”, etc., these come about from intentions to obliterate andprobably are the root of sickness.*The manifestation of Pre-OT trying to look at or into a body part or areaand a mass or ridge kicking in, between the Pre-OT and the area.Cognitions or EPs Encountered on this step:*Cognition “I can do anything any other being can do”.*Lot of somatic blows, and the first real gain on the somatic area.13.MASS THAT KICKS IN WHEN PRE-OT TRIES TO LOOK TOWARD ORINTO AN AREA OF THE BODYSuch a mass can be quite severe and can knock the Pre-OT anaten. As it isBT or cluster mass and prevents perception, it must be handled in order forthe Pre-OT to be able to see or reach into the body. The auditor gets the Pre-OT to look and then handles the mass that kicks in until it is fully cleared up,then has the Pre-OT look or reach into his body again, and then clears up thenext mass that kicks in, and so on, until he can reach into the area of the body.Then you clean up that area of the body fully, and the Pre-OT will be able toreach further into the body. As each successive area of the body is cleanedup and becomes transparent his reach is further extended toward the idealscene of a body that is transparent to the OT and does not impede hisperception or control."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"435Phenomena You are Likely to Encounter on this step:*Any or all of the previous phenomena.*BTs outside of and at a distance from the body putting mass on the body.*BTs and clusters that are so inert that they have to be thrown offphysically - plus you also have to throw away the “arms” you threwthem off with.(NB: This difficulty in blowing off BTs has also been caused by adeficiency of Vit Bl and/or insufficient rest.)*BTs/clusters who apparently had Out-Int but didn’t,they had copiedother BTs who had had Out- Int.*BTs and clusters who supposed they were being pulled in but weren’t,they had just concluded that they were.*BTs being a damaged body part and because they were being damagedcouldn’t do anything about it.Cognitions or EPs Encountered on this step:*Ability to look cleanly into areas of the body that couldn’t be reachedinto cleanly before.14.CLEANING THE BODY OF BT/CLUSTER MASSESThe Pre-OT now works on cleaning up the body of BT/cluster masses, onearea at a time, until each is clean andtransparent to his perception. Each ofthe various techniques given in the materials are used as needed to blow theseBT/cluster masses. You may in some instances have to have the Pre-OThandle BTs Dianetically running them back through a chain of incidents. Thiscan be complex with 3 or 4 BTs and chains crossed.It is very dicey to run engrams on BTs as, although they may have one mutualone, each one has an earlier chain for it that is different than that of the othersin the cluster, so you limit the action to the mutual incident they have incommon. Scn Grades O-IV can be run on a BT but this would not be usualas the BTs we’re dealing with in NED for OTs are below that.When the Pre-OT has a transparent body and a clear area around it to somedistance (barring perception of other people’s difficulties) and when herealized he is alive and very much himself the EP of NED for OTs has beenreached.L.

IfInt were out each BT would start identifying into each other’s pictures. When a flow isrun too long in one direction it will jam up and stick, then it can snap back the other way,e.g. he gets overrun on “going out of things”, the flow jams and he snaps back “in”, andstays in. There are actually two stages of Int:(a)Overrun “get out of”;(b)The stage of “go in” before “go out”.Of course this is a misconception too, as how can a thetan be in anyway.What forces him to do it is the vector flow line. The flow of “going out” gets overrun,sticks, then flips back on itself and he “goes in”, (and stays in). It’s the overrun flowreversing on him that jams him in. His think on it is like “I’m so tired of going out, so I’llstay in”. That’s his think, but what sticks him in is the overrun flow of “going out”, theflow jams and reverses.There’s also a misconception of someone being told he’s out when he’s in and beingtold he’s in when he’s out. And there’s having pictures of being out when in and picturesof being in when out. A misconception that they are where their picture is.What you have run into is a hard core of BTs with Int so badly out you have a hard"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"437time blowing them. Finding the earliest time they “went in” works mechanically, but itmust be based on some postulate or idea that what comes later is made by the earlier. Themechanism of an overrun flow sticking and then snapping back in reverse is based onagreement with some set of physical universe laws which are misconceptions.HYPNOTISMMaybe Out-Int and a hypnotic condition align. An overrun flow eventually windsup with unconsciousness, and that would wind up to hypnotism. Hypnotism is the stateof being under the duress of another’s command. BTs are so suggestible and mock upthings, they’d have to be hypnotized. It’s an artificial state brought about by drugs, shockor being under the misconception that they are hypnotized. How do you wake them up?One way is to count 4, 3, 2, 1 and snap your fingers. A short cut is simply to tell them to“wake up”. Or you can ask him “How do you wake up?” - BT answers, you do it,and BTwakes up and blows. One of the techniques from hypnotism is to ask the person how towake them up, e.g. “How do you wake up?”, BT says “Snore”, so you make a snoringnoise, BT wakes up. This works on people or BTs in a hypnotic state. They can behypnotized by a shock or explosion and then stay in a somnolent state. Part of the anatenyou encounter is their state of unconsciousness.STUCK FLOWSOut-Int is prior to a cluster. They identify into each other’s pictures and “becomeone”. So you have Out-Int as a condition for BTs and clusters.The first condition would be making pictures in the first place. The Book Onereason for pictures is that they are a safe way to live without thinking - you don’t have tothink, just act on reaction. It’s putting an ability onto a machine. (Maybe what startedthe current wave of disassociation is that these people are living in a TV (stuck flow) andcomputer age - even kids at schools have electronic calculators.) Why they make picturesis basically loss. There are large periods on the track when there was no universe orenvironment and pictures are havingness. Some verse or environment and pictures arehavingness. Some thetans think “No pictures” equates to “no memory”. Mocking uppictures is inability to recall - when they lose memories, they then mock up pictures.Somebody mocking up pictures is identityless, so they’re more likely to becoming BTsor becoming part of a cluster. They become identityless and then go into false identities.Destruction of memory is actually caused by misownership of experience.On NED for OTs you get lots of blows, then you run into these hard core BTs thatare hard to blow. They have stuck flows, and it’s a matter of how to unstick a flow. Oneway to unstick a flow is to reverse the flow. These BTs are hung up on stuck flows of “out”and “in”. They think they’re up against another thetan and actually it’s their own stuckflows that stick them. Flows can stick both ways, you’d only be able to run a process onedirection for a short while before it would stick.One way of destimulating is to tell them “Come up to present time!” There’s a stuckflow of moving along the time track with time. It becomes a stuck flow of moving forwardon the time track and one day they move backwards and stick on the track - the stuck flowreversed. That might be why NED works - it moves them back down the track, reversingthe stuck flow of time. Moving back on the track is something they haven’t done and it’s"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"438undoing the stuck flow. More than anything we are dealing with stuck flow phenomena,not pictures or anything else.Another stuck flow phenomenon is reduced awareness, they go anaten and into ahypnotic trance state - maybe out-Int and hypnotic condition align.A stuck flow is what you’re up against in NED for OTs. And that is the genus ofa BT, and that’s what a BT is, a stuck flow. So any NED for OTs auditor is going to runinto stuck flows. The impact or explosion that forms a cluster is the precipitation - thestuck flow is the predisposition . These BTs already had stuck flows and are predisposedto becoming a cluster, the sudden shock or impact precipitates it and they become acluster.There’s a special trick of blowing BTs by doing an effort-postulate action - go a littlebit earlier and they blow through later. All you have to do is give them a little jerk downthe time track and they will spring up the time track, as you have unlocked the stuck timeflow. A Pre-OT doing this will find it very handy.It has now been proven by the Flow Assessment Recall process that Int is stuckflows, and it is the prior stuck-flow.They can try to outflow against an inflow, but that’s what a ridge is. The FlowAssessment Recall process will tear up ridges that couldn’t blow, it handles BTs that areso stuck they can’t blow. It is run by outflow, inflow and “no flow” on Quad flows. Youhave to run “no flow” as that’s the way a lot of BT’s are. And the past is a no flow - thepast doesn’t flow, and they’re stuck in the past.STEPS OF FLOW ASSESSMENT RECALL PROCESS1.Clear the word “flow” and clear each of the Quad flows (F1, F2,F3, F0) and ensurethat Pre-OT understands the direction of each flow.2.Clear inflow, outflow and no flow .3.Clear the flows on the Assessment Sheet.4.This is targetted with the attention directed at one cluster, with a very narrowattention beam otherwise you will have every BT in the body going batty. It’s verynarrow atten tion at one small part of the body. It doesn’t take very long if yourattention beam is narrow. If the attention beam is too wide he will go mad. Forexample, “the face”,”the chest”. This assessment has got to be directed at the samearea and don’t shift the area until you get a BD and F/N.5.Assessment.As you are dealing with BTs, you will get better meter reads if the Pre-OT calls theassessment lines. The auditor notes the reads. Put the name of the body part beingaddressed on the Assessment Sheet. The word “Recall” is not used in theassessment. Just the flow.6.Take the largest reading line and have the Pre-OT run “Recall ( assessed item ), on"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"439BTs telepathically. This will produce reads and an sBD or BD and F/N. It is notrun past the first sBD or BD or it will overrun and start jumping into another flow.At first sBD or BD F/N, you cease running the process and indicate the F/N.7.Reassess the Assessment Sheet and run the next largest reading line by Recallprocess. Continue to reassess and run the largest reading line. Over and over andover. It will eventually go into an F/Ning assessment.NOTES ON PROCESSIf you get an sBD or BD during the assessment take that line and run it by “Recall- do not continue through the assessment as you have a BDing item.If you get a BD F/N on assessment, don’t run that line by “Recall____________”as it will just overrun. There was a blow on that line. Indicate the F/N, then continueassessing for next line to run.Later in the assessment the Sensitivity will have to be raised way up to pick up reads.And you run any slightest read even if only a Tick or Stop.If during assessment or during the process the TA suddenly drops (BDs) into an F/Ning TA, you don’t continue that session. Don’t continue to assess, or ask anotherauditing question. Just simply indicate the F/Ning TA and end off the session. Take upthe assessment tomorrow - it may just F/N, or you may get further reads to run. But donot continue the assessment or process past a sudden BD to F/Ning TA.The EP is when you can’t get any more reads with Sensitivity cranked up and youjust get an F/Ning assessment.L.

Thisis especially true on any powerful RD such as this one. It would be completely forbidden to gooff Pgm on NED for OTs and run something else. By something else is meant grades, or part ofanother RD, or some other type of auditing. This hasn’t been done but the consequences wouldbe disastrous. This is mentioned to ensure that no one ever does this. There is the exception ofa Touch Assist or a Contact Assist but never a Dianetic Assist for sure.Q AND AYou can start handling a somatic and make the mistake of leaving it incomplete. You canalso make a mistake on mass One and it goes over into mass Two. This gives a general rule:NEVER GET MORE THAN ONE MASS OR CATEGORY ACTIVE, AND ALWAYSCOMPLETE TO AN EP THE MASS OR CATEGORY STARTED BEFORE GOING ON TOANOTHER MASS OR CATEGORY.HAVINGNESSDon’t run Havingness during the RD, it beefs BTs up and makes them tougher to blow.BTs and clusters are packed in tight in a total non-confront. What a guy can’t confront,he is either obsessively having, or the opposite - he has a Can’t Have on it. BTs are in Can’t Have,Waste, or below, they don’t respond to HAVE, they mostly respond to BE.Allergies are based on Can’t Have and Waste, and BTs are in a total Can’t Have, so NEDfor OTs properly run will probably cure some allergies.L.

It is not always that magnificient butit is sometimes functional.What you do is mock up a “thetan hand” and using the edge of it as a sort of knife, you pass itbetween the body and black masses and sever them off. These masses are attached to the body by stringsor lines or suction cups or beams. You sever the line or string holding them to the body. Sometimesthe mocked up hand departs with them, because after all it was mocked up and it would of course vanish.COMPOSITE MASSES AND LAYERED CLUSTERSYou use this technique - the “thetan hand” - to separate ridges and masses, or to split up oppositemasses. Two or more ridges may be jammed together into a mass, sometimes there are layers upon layersof clusters. Pass the “thetan hand” between them, between two ridges, or masses or layer of clusters tosever the connection and split them up into separate pieces, which can then be blown, one piece at a time.COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE MASSESSometimes you will encounter a mass that is so inert that it won’t even come into communicationwith “Hello and OK”. Such masses may have to be thrown off physically, using a mocked up hand. ThePre-OT simply takes the mass and physically throws it off. And then throws away the mocked up handtoo - so there is no connection or line back to the body. This has been referred to as the “yo-heave”technique, and while it isn’t particularly of benefit to BTs and clusters, it is a way of getting rid of acompletely unresponsive mass when all else fails. Such unresponsive masses are not that common.Most commonly, any difficulties in blowing BTs and clusters come from (a) over-restimulaton due totoo long a session, (b) overrun session EP (F/N TA), (c) lack of sleep or tiredness of the Pre-OT, or (d)a deficiency of Calcium or Vitamin B1. Those are the most common reasons for difficulty and are easilyremedied.L. RON HUBBARDFOUNDERLRH:dm:kjmCopyright (c) 1978by L.

Thereare several ways in which BTs and clusters can be missed or overlooked. First of all is by thePre-OT thinking that the mass he perceives is the body when it actually is the mass of BTs andclusters.Next there is the BT or cluster producing a somatic in another part of the body, orinfluencing another part of the body. Have the Pre-OT trace back from the picture or somatic tothe BT or cluster. The Pre-OT can do this even though the BTs and clusters are generallyconfused about whose picture is whose. As the Pre-OT looks for where the BT or cluster is themeter will read and the auditor can steer the Pre-OT and help him find the position in the bodyof that BT or cluster.Some BTs and clusters are hiding, secretive, being invisible, hidden or withdrawn. Askthe Pre-OT to look for BTs and clusters in each of these categories and blow them. Be sure tocomplete handling one category before taking up another category or you’ll get over-restimulationand a beef up.Then there is the BT or cluster holding other BTs and clusters in or one BT or clusterholding other BTs or clusters compressed or suppressed. Handle the BT or cluster doing this first,then the others will blow off easily. When a very small mass is activated it will increase insizebefore blowing - there can be a thousand or two BTs in such a mass and sometimes these explodeapart as they blow. Although the mass becomes very heavy when it is activated, it’s not a big BT,it’s a lot of little BTs, under suppression.You can run into a cluster causing damage to the body, and after blowing this cluster, youthen look for and handle other BTs and clusters who were copying it, or stuck in pictures of thedamaged area and held in it or holding onto it.There are BTs and clusters who are refusing to make pictures, as well as BTs and clustersobsessively making pictures. These need to be looked for and handled.Some BTs and clusters are being inert masses and don’t seem to respond until put intocommunication and could be missed unless the Pre-OT were asked to look for BTs and clustersbeing inert masses; BTs and clusters being dead or who think they are dead; being MEST; beingmolecules.The Pre-OT may think he/she has an aura. An aura actually is a collection of BTs and"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"445clusters mocking up the aura - and sticking in it - as it is a highly electronic mock up. It is beingmocked up by BTs and clusters and has BTs and clusters sticking in it. You may encountersomething like a whole person - body and BTs and clusters that were suppressed down to nothing- you contact it as a very small mass and it increases in size to a whole body and aura, completewith BTs and clusters mocking it up and sticking in it. But that’s what an aura is - a collectionof BTs and clusters and that’s all it is.Very small dense masses. These when activated can increase to huge size and massknocking the Pre-OT anaten, sometimes for quite a long period of time. As the anaten comes off,the mass will start to disintegrate. The anaten is the “glue” that holds them together and whenthe anaten runs out, the BTs and clusters will blow off easily.The Pre-OT can work on cleaning out a body part or area of BTs and clusters and get thearea looking clean. Then you have the Pre-OT look inside or behind or on the other side of bonesor organs or ridges in the area to find BTs and clusters. Unless you have the Pre-OT look insideor behind or on the other side ,these would be missed or overlooked. In one instance a somaticdidn’t start to resolve until this action was done.BTs and clusters can be conditions (as different from being a terminal) - conditions thatthey associate with the body - whatever the body can do, e.g. a being who was being“unconsciousness”. So have the Pre-OT look for BTs or clusters being body conditions.A BT or cluster can believe that he is his own picture - or somebody else’s picture for thatmatter. A picture that is hard to blow is probably composed of BTs and clusters being the objectsin the picture, e.g. a picture of a field with a tree and a cow in it. The tree is a being being a tree,there’s a being being a cow and a being being a field. Together these beings compose the picture.Or you could have one being being a pole trap and another thetan who came along and stuck tothe pole trap. So if a picture is hard to blow, check for BTs and clusters being the objects of whichthe picture is composed. And when you have blown the original beings also blow off any whostuck to it.Phrases such as “a man of my kidney”, “got no spine”, “got to have spine”, “no stomachfor it”, confuse BTs and clusters in those body parts and play a role in pinning them in. You mayrun into such phrases or cliches when asking the What? Who? questions. Just acknowledge andrepeat the What? Who? question.Probably the root of sickness or psychosomatics is in negative beingnesses. BTs andclusters being the negative of a body part, such as “a no hand” or “a no stomach”, “a no body”,etc. When you ask the What? Who? questions you’ll run into answers such as “no hand”, thenit will flip to the positive “hand”, before blowing. These negatives come about from intentionsto obliterate - so they become a “no ________”. They tend to act as a negative terminal to apositive terminal and thus keep things pinned down. After you’ve cleaned up a somatic area ofall BTs and clusters in it and being it and hidden “behind”, have the Pre-OT look for thesenegative beingnesses.Some chronic somatics depart very fast and don’t return. These are almost miracle innature. Other chronic somatics gradually lessen and can disappear in the course of the wholeRundown. So don’t despair if you don’t get an instant alleviation of the chronic somatic but justkeep on with the Rundown and don’t specialize in chronic somatics. Also be very cheered upwhen you hit an instant disappearance of one. Both conditions can exist in the same Pre-OT ondifferent chronic somatics.L. RON HUBBARDLRH:dm:kjmFOUNDERCopyright (c) 1978by L.

But this will wind up with the Pre-OT being pulled down to their wavelength. The trick is to put your attention on the outerperimeter, and find something inside it, not put your attention on the something. You tryto put your attention on the perimeter and your attention gets pulled into a somatic area- it’s BTs and clusters pulling your attention into them.They are invisible and are trying to get attention. They have an impossible problemof trying to get attention, but can’t get attention. Only their mass, or their creating asomatic would get attention. It’s almost as if pictures are a trick to get attention. Thisfactor of trying to get attention is why a thetan goes into mass. This is an explanation forlife, and why a thetan picks up a body. The reason why acknowledgement works isbecause an acknowledgement is attention.This is attraction of attention. You try to put your attention on Point A - it is pulledback to a BT or cluster. It’s a contest of trying to put your attention on the actual body,and their magnetic pull of attention onto themselves.There is also a factor of “negative attention” - they don’t want attention on them andknock you unconscious if you put attention on them."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"447A way to handle is to move such BTs and cluster back to the first time they wantedattention and they blow.PUTTING ATTENTION OUT TO PERIMETERHave the Pre-OT put his attention outward to the perimeter, or “look” toward theouter perimeter and the Pre-OT will find something inside the perimeter and you have thePre-OT blow it off. You will by doing this encounter black mass and you can start quitea mass commotion. Have the Pre-OT look further than the perimeter of the body and hewill find masses out there pushing in on the body. Handle these masses with the “Whatare you?”, ack, “Who are you?” technique and they blow.Practically all somatics respond this way - the BT or cluster out there is keeping abone or the body in a state of distortion.BTs or clusters can turn on a kind of “fluid” which is painful when it touches thebody, it’s not that they are in an incident that has that somatic, they exude this “fluid” andwhen it hits the body it’s painful.If you lift your attention beam and put it out, they’ll tend to follow your attentionbeam, and sometimes come halfway out. If the Pre-OT’s body is up against a solid object,the BTs and clusters can get stuck in the object (suck as a chair).The idea is to have the Pre-OT look out to the perimeter, or past the perimeter andcontact masses out there, that are pushing in on the body. blow these off with the “Whatare you?”, ack, “Who are you?” technique.It is really remarkable how well this works!L.

This could be “dust” as an irritant. Or“poison”, “bad food”, “paint fumes”, etc.The item is handled by finding and blowing off BTs and clusters who are:(a) being the item(b) resisting the item"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"449The item will then cease to read.Step Two - The Body PartThe body part affected by the item. E.g. for the item “dust” the body part was“lungs”. For “poison” or “bad food” the body part could be “stomach”.On this step you handle BTs being the body part, i.e. being “lungs”. This includesthe negative of BTs being “a no body part” such as “no lungs”. And BTs and clusters stuckin and on the body part, or area of the body, or affecting the body part or area. When allsuch BTs and clusters are handled, the body part will no longer read.Step Three - IllnessThe next action is to handle illnesses of the body part(i.e. BTs and clusters being“sick lungs” or being a condition of an illness or disease or the body part.) “Illness of bodypart” will cease to read.Step Four - Cures for IllnessYou will now find BTs and clusters being cures for illnesses of the body part. Handleall such BTs and clusters by blowing them off. “Cures for Illness” will then cease to read.Step Five - Protest of Cures for the IllnessYou will now find BTs and clusters protesting cures for the illness. Blow all theseoff and “Protest of cures for the Illness” will cease to read.Step Six - Body PartYou will find that the original body part will now be reading again. You handle allBTs and clusters, on or in or being the body part, until they’re all handled and the bodypart just F/Ns.Step Seven - ItemNow the original item (from Step One) will be reading again and so you blow offall BTs and clusters on the item. This includes BTs and clusters with engrams on the item,BTs and clusters who have been run on the item when they didn’t have that item (i.e.wrong item for them), and BTs and clusters who copied it. You may even encounter BTswho went Clear, and thought they had engrams on it when they didn’t.Step Eight - Illness On ItThere are periods of time when the person had the physical condition, sometimesyears of illness, (which due to mutual shared experience of the illness), made a cluster.This is the period of the illness or physical condition as a cluster-making incident. Theseare BTs and clusters who were not actually connected with the item, or illness themselves,but were made into a cluster and added on, due to the period of illness which theyexperienced.The above are the full steps and sequence for handling a physical condition or"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"450illness. If not done fully or omitted, the condition will recur. So all steps must be fully donein that sequence.On each step of this sequence the BTs and clusters are handled with the varioustechniques given for blowing them - the Valence Technique is the most usual andeffective method.The item for Step One is found by asking the PreOT for what caused or producedthe condition. It will most likely be the first item given by the PreOT. Be alert for gettinginto listing or getting an out-list. If so the most likely error is that it was the first item onthe list, and this item was invalidated by going past it, or by over-listing past it, or the itemwas found and audited previously but not fully handled resulting in the item beingsuppressed or invalidated.The steps are repeated here in short form for auditor use:1.The item2.The body part3.Illness (of the body part)4.Cures for Illness5.Protest of cures for the illness6.The body part (again)7.The item (again)8.The period of illness on it (Cluster-making incident)L.

So the Pre-OT now hasBTs who were PTS to mother and grandfather. And the Pre-OT was in contact with these BTswhen they were on mother, and earlier in the Pre-OT’s life when the BTs were on grandfather.This transfer of BTs to successive family members causes a genetic misidentification - itconvinces BTs that they are genetic.There are also BTs who went PTS to a person that they were PTS to in an earlier life or lives.They run into the same person in this lifetime and go into restim.When a person gets sick there is usually a PTS terminal to be found at the bottom of it. Butthe PTSness may be that of a BT or cluster which then hits the pc.Now if you went on listing this BT or cluster you would find one for sure. But it is not thePTS terminal for all of the BTs in the custer so when you finish you will have indicated the wrongPTS terminal and will have hung the remainder of the cluster with a wrong item which they willthen dramatize. So don’t list a BT or cluster by L & N. What you do is ask them who or whatthey are PTS to at which time you will probably get a blow of some of them. Then you indicateto those that didn’t blow that it is a wrong item for the rest of them. You will either get the clusterblown with these two steps or the rest of them will blow by other NED for OTs processes.When running NED for OTs you will sometimes encounter the phenomenon of Pre-OT’sattention fixed on or drawn to a remote point, and the Pre-OT can blow off the BT or cluster inthat remote location that is drawing his attention. If the remote point is a person the Pre-OT isPTS to, you could expect an amazing change of the remote person where he or she now tries torestore communication with the Pre-OT or ends the conflict or problem. This is the phenomenonof the SP now making things right with the PTS person being handled, and is the same EP as isencountered on the New Vitality Rundown and on PTS-Problems handling when it is done fullyto EP. It’s not that you are trying to handle PTSness with NED for OTs, but in such an instanceas described above you can expect the same EP to occur.LRH:dm:kjmL. RON HUBBARDCopyright (c) 1978FOUNDERby L.

On a Clear or above, any R/S comes from an R/Sing BT or cluster, whohas and is dramatizing an Ev Purp. The handling is to locate the BT or cluster and blowit off. An R/S will probably go right down to the basic of a cumulative cluster. You wouldlocate the offending cluster and Date/Locate down to the basic and blow the clusters andBTs off. Clusters can be pretty vicious and you get an R/Ser at the bottom of the cluster.I’ve even encountered a cluster that made a profession out of killing patients in hospitals- the doctors would wonder why a patient was fine and then all of a sudden take a turn forthe worse and die.Full “NED for OTs” is essential for the terminated handling of R/Ses on a Clear orabove.Very few BTs and clusters are vicious or vengeful, most are benign, but an R/S willgo down to the basic incident of a cluster dramatizing or being an Ev Purp. These willusually be wildly out of valence and have horrendous overts and crimes down the track.To handle R/Ses, you take the statement originally reported to be R/Sing and findthe position in the body of the BT or cluster connected with that R/S statement. You’ll turnit back on again if you locate the position where that thing was - the R/S will come on.It’s a combination of position (in the body) and the statement.

There is no personal identity.Christian Science asserts that “All is mind, infinite mind” - that’s a collectiveidentity and will make a BT or cluster being a Christian Scientist very hard to blow.This is the reason a cluster doesn’t blow, a cluster has the wrong item “us”, withoutpersonal identity. So the technique of “What are you?”,”Who are you?” runs into troublewhen you get a totally general zealot identity of “I’m the army”, or “I’m ChristianScientist”, “I’m us”, and you don’t get a blow. If you keep asking “Who?” you just geta repeat answer “us”, and these collective identities won’t give a blow.There’s an implant on the track on the subject of “We are all one”, “All is one”.Someone stuck in this actually goes from the generality of “All is one” and thenindividuates from that! That’s actually the basic definition of individuation (as differentfrom individuality).A thetan who is “dead” acts like a cluster - there’s nobody running the show - andhis manifestations are those of a cluster. This is the Socialist, everyone belongs to “TheState”, individualism is negated, it’s all “The People”.TV, Drugs and Socialism are the factors that are bringing about the currentdeterioration of society, and with these three you can predict a super break up. You getNCG cases, or subtle NCG cases (these make only minor gain), they are a collective mass.The speed of effect of auditing would go up after an Ethics Repair List and CriminalityRundown because on the Criminality Rundown you’ll get a “de-mutualization”. If youhave a TV and Drug culture and enter in a Welfare State you’ll get this. In Communisma peron is severely punished if he shows any individuality."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"454There are crime waves after waves which are due to a super association with Death.Then guys have seen so much Death, they consider themselves dead. It isn’t that they’retaught to kill, it’s that by association with Death, they have become “dead” andirresponsible.Therefore as a rule, while engaging in any collective, social or organizationalactivity, you have to foster individuality.The collective identity as an answer from a BT or cluster will not produce a blow,because it is a wrong item.WRONG ITEMSYou can always get a read on “Wrong item?” because all items are wrong - any nameor identity (except “me”) is a wrong item.When you’ve just corrected a list and you want to make sure you’ve got the rightitem, you ask if it’s the correct item and it will be. If you then ask if it’s and incorrect item,it will read! Because all items (except “me”) will read as wrong items. This explains howthe What? Who? technique works. You ask “What?” and the answer they give you is thewrong item, you ask “Who?” and they give you the right item (“me”) and blow. They goClear on getting the right item!REPEATING ANSWERWhen you encounter a repeating answer from a BT or cluster on “What?”, “Who?”they won’t blow, as they keep giving a wrong item. One way to handle would be usingthe “Yo-heave” technique of resorting to throwing them off physically. That is a “whenall else fails”.There is a mechanism which works whereby you can handle the repeating answer.Instead of acking “Who?” again, you ask “What were you before you became that?” - theysay “me” - and blow.L.

But you only indicate the line that reads, and mustnot engage in running engrams. Sometimes there will be three or four different chains alltangled up and you have to sort these out. You can also get a kind of linear chain or “timetrack” composed of a wrong item that was run and jumped from one BT to another andformed them into a sort of false “linear track”.Handle the L3RF Method 3, as you will find there are often more than one BT orcluster who have what the L3RF line states, wrong with them.Another reason for BTs run Dianetically failing to blow, is when they were run onwhat appeared to be a motivator chain, it was really an overt chain, and when this isstraightened out and handled as an overt chain, they blow.Because you after all are handling several BTs when you handle a cluster, Dianeticsmay have operated differently on the different BTs in the cluster. Therefore it may benecessary to run the L3RF several times on the same auditing session as they will havedifferent reasons why they got hung up.You could also do a C/S 53RL on a BT.L.

On OT III repairs thePreOT when audited is usually a relay point from the auditor to the BT. On NED for OTsthe PreOT is becoming more and more OT and actually does most of the auditing of BTsand clusters. The auditor should only act in the session to keep the PreOT working onblowing BTs and clusters. And should not act in the session when the PreOT is working.Done right this is the easiest auditing there is. Only if the PreOT runs into a difficult BTor cluster does the auditor act and then only as needed to get it sorted out.The auditor needs to keep a sharp eye on the meter and must be proficient at handlinga very loose needle at high Sensitivity, as he will need to do this to get reads, especiallylater in the Rundown.During the Rundown F/Ns become more frequent to a point where the needle is F/Ning most of the time, reads and BDs to F/N when the PreOT blows a BT or cluster. Asthese are often several blows in succession the auditor shouldn’t interrupt the PreOT withquestions or F/N indications. (It would be impossible to indicate all the F/Ns anyway,especially later in the Rundown.) What’s more important is indicating where the chargeis, sometimes steering the PreOT by meter read to where the BT is located in the body orsorting out whether it’s a single BT, a cluster, a cumulative cluster, etc.The auditor should inform the PreOT of what is reading and use the meter reads tohelp PreOT identify and find masses. Never let the PreOT try to answer an unreadingquestion or to look for a BT or cluster that isn’t reading. Tell him when the TA is F/Ningor he may overrun. The F/N is unimportant and should not be indicated unless you’rerunning ruds.LRH:dm:kjmL. RON HUBBARDCopyright (c) 1978FOUNDERby L.

The instruction to check interest only applies to Step 4F, (Repair of Past Auditing). Allthe other steps, (4A - 4E, 4F - 4I) are done without checking interest.The usual rules of not running anything that doesn’t read, and checking for false read or protest ifthe pc is not interested or protesty, apply to all steps.ADDITIONAL ACTIONAfter running or handling any category, one should check whether this acted as a wrong item (orwrong indication) to other BTs to whom it did not apply, but only if there seems to be trouble.Example 1:Auditor completes handling “BTs who went Clear and were audited on engrams”.Auditor can then check “Did ‘went Clear and then audited on engrams’, act as a wrongitem for other BTs to whom it did not apply?” and if reading indicates this was a wrongitem to the others.Example 2:Auditor completes handling “BTs audited past erasure”. Then auditor can check “Did‘audited past erasure’ act as a wrong item to other BTs?” And if reading, indicate.If discomfort or lack of GIs seems to indicate trouble has occurred be sure to check if it has actedas a wrong item, however you can also use the Repair List (NED for OTs Series 24).This pheonmenon of other BTs taking on a wrong item by copying what is run on other BTs tendsto happen on any category or button being run. It happens to a far greater degree if an Overrun occurs,i.e. one goes on trying to handle the same category or button after it has been handled, and starts in on anew area of the body or new category using the same category or button that has just been handled.Sometimes when using a category or button, a series of automatic blows will occur, you will geta floating TA, and this is the EP for that action and the EP for the session. Hence the rule of short sessioningon NED for OTs and ending off on a floating TA.LRH:dm:kjmL. RON HUBBARDCopyright (c) 1978FOUNDERby L.

Not having fully blown they reactback against the body with energy or mass.The reason why they only partially blow is because they are still mixed up in a masswith untouched, unaudited BTs that stick them. By having the Pre-OT reach out in frontof the partially blown BTs with a question “Who are you?”, the uncleared BT or BTs gethandled. This may have to be repeated as the group of BTs may blow further out and hangup again. Simply keep putting the question “Who are you?” out in front of the BTs eachtime they hang up until they blow apart and clear fully and completely.It is interesting that the mass sometimes flies apart like sparks way out there. It isat that moment the Pre-OT experiences a feeling of relaxation.L. RON HUBBARDFOUNDERLRH:dm:kjmCopyright (c) 1978by L.

The BTs don’t know what the person is saying, nordo they know what is being said to the person, due to these Mis-Us. And the person gets caughtin the middle of this flow channel, experiencing the reaction to the BT’s Mis-U. The usualreaction of the BTs is just to withdraw.BTs can get Mis-Us from reading matter, foreign languages, and I have found BTs thatdon’t speak English. Where it really goes wild is in auditing, where the BT has a Mis-U on theauditing command or question. They would then answer the auditing question wrong tothemselves, causing a case hang up right there.There is also a basic consideration that the Dead would not understand anything anyway.This phenomenon of BT’s Mis-Us explains why some try to communicate with pictures.Since this can cause a case to hang fire in auditing you need to know about this and to checkfor a Mis-U in the auditing command or question, remembering that it could be a BT’s Mis-Uand not necessarily the Pre-OT’s Mis-U. So auditors and C/Ses are alerted to this as a possiblereason for a case to hang fire. The remedy is to repair the situation, by checking for Mis-Us inthe commands or auditing questions, and handling BTs hung up in these.As a rundown you would take these up by categories and fully handle them as follows. Butthis as a rundown comes later on in NED for OTs.1.Clear with the Pre-OT the idea of communicating with BTs by concept, not with words.The Pre-OT may have to learn this trick of communicating conceptually. Clear the words“concept”, “idea”, “thought”, “spoken words”, “written words”, “picture”. Then cleartheidea of communicating conceptually. You may have to do a little drill with the personby getting him/her to think a simple thought, such as “It’s a nice day”, without verbalizingit or thinking in words or pictures. You could have the person think the thoughtconceptually, then think it with words, then conceptually, then with words."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"468Or even think the thought while saying different words or gobble-dy-gook. Don’t overdothis, it is just to get the Pre-OT to a point where he can communicate to a BT conceptually.2.Assess through these categories until you get a read:“A BT with a Mis-U..........in auditing commands?in auditing questions?in spoken words?in reading matter?in entertainment?in study?in English?in foreign languages?symbol?sound?3.Have the Pre-OT locate where the BT is in relationship to the body.4.Blow the BT by usual NED for OTs techniques (What? Who?), remembering that the Pre-OT must ask these questions (and receive the answers to them) conceptually, so as to avoidMis-U words in this communication.5.Check for any other BT within this category and handle as above, until there are no moreBTs with Mis-Us in this category.6.Continue down the assessment in #2 above until you get a read and handle as above, andso on.7.When you have completed the categories given above, make a final check for any other BTwith a Mis-U, and handle before leaving this Rundown.This discovery shows the importance of clearing words used in auditing questions andcommands, and the importance of clearing Mis-U words in general. And of course the fact thatthese Mis-Us may be a BT’s Mis-Us rather than the person’s own Mis-Us, will dispel any mysteryabout why one can run into Mis-U word phenomena when one knows the word himself. But don’tlet this make you any less alert for words the Pre-OT may have misunderstood in auditingquestions or commands, and be sure to clear these.These BTs with Mis-Us are easily handled by use of the trick of communicating with themconceptually, rather than with words.L.

If there is noread on the first item, one has to list from the BT or cluster to get a reading item. It is oftena 6 or 10 item list (but could be shorter, including the first item on the list). The followingexamples are given to show what such a list could look like. The items in these examplesand the size of reads shown, are not for reference but are purely by way of illustration."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"470Example 1:“ What are you?”A leafA treeA tree trunkA branchA twigA broken limb LF - F/N (The item)Example 2:“ What are you?”A swordAn arenaA crowdA wild animalA lionDustBloodA dying manA gladiator F - F/N (The item)Example 3:“ What are you?”A brain LFBD - F/N (The item)Example 4:“ What are you?”There is no answer from the BTor cluster.The technique used here is to run“Hello and Okay” (See HCOB 17 SEP 78Issue I NOTs Series 7, page 4) on theBT or cluster.When it is answering up, then proceedas above in other examples.

(Otherwise the auditor wouldn’tknow what item the BT gave in answer to”What are you?”, nor would the auditor know whetherit was a reading item.) The auditor is responsible for the communication in the session and forcontrol of the session."},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"471VALENCE LISTING TECHNIQUE STEPS1.“ Where is the BT (or cluster)? “The auditor has the PreOT locate where the BT or cluster is by position in relation to thebody. The auditor notes the area named by the PreOT and whether it reads. Do not let the PreOTgo looking for additional new areas until the reading area is fully handled.2.“ What are you? “The auditor has the PreOT ask the BT or cluster the question, and relay the answer(s) tothe auditor. The auditor writes these down and notes any read. If the first item does not read theauditor has the PreOT continue to ask the question and relay the items to the auditor, until thereis a reading item, and must not go past it.3.AcknowledgementThe PreOT acknowledges it.4.“ Who are you? “The PreOT asks the BT “Who are you?”, it cognites “I’m me” and blows.(But if there is no blow, or if there are BTs, at once suspect that a wrong item was found,and correct it to the right item. Complete the steps to a blow.)WARNINGThere is a danger here of finding a wrong item, underlisting or overlisting. Wrong itemsand list errors recoil heavily on a case. BTs and clusters in their lowered awareness are verysusceptible to suggestion, and tend to copy obsessively. Thus it is very essential that one does notleave any BT or cluster with a wrong item or out-list.Auditors and C/Ses are alerted to watch for any sudden decline of the case when this listingaction has been done, and to at once suspect and handle any out-list/wrong item.Despite the danger of listing errors, it will be necessary to use this technique of listing forthe item, at some point on any case being audited on NED for OTs, since BTs and clusters oftenbegin by giving wrong items in answer to the question: “What are you?”. However, a good auditorcan be trained to L & N successfully and get the right item. The indicators of a wrong item (seeLaws of L & N) are very obvious, both to the auditor and C/S, and bring about a dramatic caseresurgence when spotted and corrected.HANDLING A WRONG ITEMImmediately when the PreOTs GIs go out or BIs appear in the session the auditor mustcheck for”A wrong item?”,”An out-list?”, and handle. Find where the BT or cluster with thewrong item or out-list is by position in relation to the body, and find and correct the wrong item/out-list on that BT or cluster. After locating and indicating the wrong item or list BPC,\\always\\followthrough and find the right item, and continue the steps of the Valence Technique until the BT orcluster blows. There may be more than one BT or cluster with a wrong item or out-list, so it isessential to locate the BT or cluster by position in relation to the body.After handling the BT or cluster to a blow, check your original question (“Wrong item?”,“List error?”) again to ensure there are no more BTs or clusters with a wrong item. Don’t go ontrying to repair wrong items when the question”Wrong item?”ceases to read or F/Ns, or you willstart messing up BTs and clusters who did not have that wrong with them."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"472If difficulty is encountered in repairing a list error, it could be sitting on an earlier out-listor wrong item on that BT or cluster.An L4BRA can be used to repair a wrong item or out-list on a BT or cluster, but if so thelist must be used Method 3, and care used to find the BT or cluster by position, and to handle eachBT or cluster encountered to blow.POSSIBLE ERRORSErrors that could possibly be made and could be anticipated on this technique are:(a)The auditor missing the read on the first item and causing overlisting,(b)Listing past the first reading item (overlisting),(c)Leaving a BT or cluster with a wrong item,(d)Leaving a BT or cluster not blown or only partially blown,(e)Going past an F/N on listing (bypassing the item),(f)Leaving the list incomplete,(g)Jumping from one BT or cluster to another without completing the first one started,(h)Overworking the question”Wrong item?”and trying to repair other BTs who didn’t havethat wrong with them.(Remember that all items are wrong to some degree, as the only really right item is”Me”.)These possible errors could even be assessed if need be.OK TO AUDIT OR C/SIt is called to attention that the March 66 HCO PLs on High Crime Policy apply to this issueand its references, which must be High Crimed by any auditor or C/S before using them.FLUB, CRAM, RETREAD SYSTEMThe materials of L & N are covered on Class IV, so there is no excuse for an auditor to flubL & N, nor to be ignorant of the Laws of L & N.The Flub, Cram, Retread System means that on the first auditor flub he goes to Crammingon the materials flubbed, one more flub on these materials and he goes to Retread. It is a systemput in at Flag to ensure that there were no failures on FCCIs with new internes auditing in the HGC.It is a proven workable system. It is imperative, mandatory, that the Flub, Cram, Retread Systembe used on this listing technique on NED for OTs, and no C/S, Cramming Officer, nor Tech/Qualexecutive may get reasonable about this, nor allow any persuasion or pressure to undermine orcounter this system.Despite the liability to the pc if flubbed, actions such as L & N, L & N Repair, and Dating/Locating, are actually easy to do correctly, produce spectacular results when done right, and aresometimes necessary auditing techniques. So don’t get reasonable about demanding that theseactions be done correctly.

If they do not, then their MUs, False Data must be cleaned up, and the materialsthoroughly restudied so that they will get the expected excellent results from standard applicationof the Tech.Another factor on flubby auditors is that sometimes an auditor (or C/S) will dramatize thesame out-tech on pcs that exists on his/her own case. Therefore the attention of the C/S or SeniorC/S is called to this point, and the case of a flubbing Tech/Qual person should be checked forout-tech and if there is any get it corrected in addition to the Cramming or Retread action.

One must mot seek to carry on auditing a BT after it has blown, as this wouldresult in other BTs and clusters copying and misidentifying themselves with the blown BT.Many BTs blow very easily. Sometimes after handling one BT or cluster, you will get aseries of easy rapid blows, or even a repetitive or automatic blow. These points are covered inearlier NED for OTs issues, and are not changed by anything in this issue.This refinement in the Valence Technique will enable you to handle and blow BTs andclusters with more accuracy and rapidity. And there are some BTs that wouldn’t have blownotherwise, that this listing step will handle.L. RON HUBBARDFOUNDERLRH:dm:kjmCopyright (c) 1979by L.

Doing so canguarantee a blow.A lot of the time there is nothing there to acknowledge because it has already blown.Most of the time this isn’t needed, but when used it does prevent a hang-up when the BThasn’t gone. So its actual value is the fact that it can guarantee a blow.(By the way, you can call one back and acknowledge it, but don’t get into that. Thisis mentioned simply because it is possible to call them back.)THE FULL STEPS OF THE VALENCE TECHNIQUE0.Identifying what you are going to handle.Although this is strictly speaking not part of the Valence Technique, one has to start"},{"pageNumber":475,"pageContent":"475off by finding a BT or cluster that you are going to blow with the NOTs ValenceTechnique. This zero step then consists of whatever action one is on, such as Rudiments,a NOTs Program Step, Repair List or whatever, that uncovers a reading charge that oneidentifies as a BT or cluster. Having found a reading charge one has to identify what thatcharge is coming from, i.e. a BT or a cluster (and less commonly, “a BT that thinks it’sa cluster”, or “a cluster that thinks it’s a BT”).This step varies depending on what Program step or category you are working on.E.g. on Program Step #17, “Mass Mistaken For the Mass of the Body”, you ask the Pre-OT to “Look over the body and tell me if there is any mass.” or “...any massy body partor area?”, or “...any area of the body that is solid?”. When you get a reading area of mass,you then need to identify what this is, i.e. “Is it a BT?”, “Is it a cluster?”.On Step #18, “BTs Being Body Parts”, you have the Pre-OT look over the variousparts of the body until you get a reading body part. Or, you call off various parts, i.e.“Head?”, “Face?”, “Neck?”, “Inside?”, “Outside?”, etc. until you get a read. In thisinstance you have the position or area of the body where the BT or cluster is, but still needto identify it by asking: a BT?, a Cluster? (But note that in this instance as in the paragraphabove, you have also found where the BT or Cluster is in relation to the body).But if you are flying ruds, or handling a preparesd list, to start with all you have isa reading question. You then find\\whose\\charge it is, (per HCOB 20 Dec 79 AUDITINGSOMEBODY UNDER CONSTANT AND CONTINUOUS PT STRESS and HCOB 22Dec 79 FLYING RUDS AT OT III AND ABOVE) by asking: “Is it yours?”, “a BT’s?,“a cluster’s?” or , “Is it also __________’s?”. This action identifies what you have foundand are now going to handle.This is really a preliminary step to the Valence Technique in which you are (a)finding something to run, and (b) identifying what you have found. You are establishingwhether it is “a BT”, “a cluster”, maybe “several BTs”, or even “more than one cluster”,(in the case of a plural, the Pre-OT would need to be told to limit his attention to one ofthese, so you can handle one at a time.)Having found a charge and identified what it is, you now can move into the ValenceTechnique to blow that BT or cluster (unless it has already blown by this point, which isquite often so, many blow by inspection, especially if the Pre-OT is running cleanly andrapidly).1.“Where is the BT (or cluster)?”The auditor has the Pre-OT locate where the BT or cluster is by position in relationto the body. The auditor notes the area named by the Pre-OT and whether it reads. Whenthe Pre-OT names the correct place it will read. Do not let the Pre-OT go on looking foradditional new areas until the reading area is fully handled.(As noted above under Step 0, you may have already located where the BT is, inwhich case you wouldn’t then ask the Pre-OT to find where t is.)The location of a BT or cluster is not always in the body, they can also be on the body,outside the body, even at some distance from the body.Steps 0 and 1 are not rote. These steps are done to then enable the Pre-OT to limit"},{"pageNumber":476,"pageContent":"476his attention span to the specific BT or cluster while asking the auditing question.Otherwise you could jump from BT to BT, restimulating other areas than that beingworked on.2.“What are you?”(Note that any and all listing done follows the HCOB 1 Aug 68 THE LAWS OFLISTING AND NULLING. These have not changed just because they are being used ina different process. An auditor who does not know these should not attempt this step, andshould master this HCOB before attemtping this step.)The auditor has the Pre-OT ask the BT or cluster the question, and relay the answerto the auditor, who writes the answer down and notes whether it read. Only if the first itemdoes not read, do you list further items. Very often the first answer reads and that is theitem.If the first item did not read, you’ve now got to ask him for another answer, and youhave got to make sure that it comes from that exact spot or area. You have got to makesure that he isn’t shifting his attention all over his “left side”, or you’d get the whole bankin that area alive. You could say: “Now, from that same spot, is there another answer?another? another?”. And this is done only to the first reading item. You might have toverify it: “Is that (answer) from the same spot?”.This is why you establish where the BT or cluster is located in Step 1, as you canthen ensure that the Pre-OT limits his attention to, and directs the auditing question to, thatexact spot. E.g. “Put your attention on the top of your left ear and ask “What are you?”The auditor indicates the first reading item. (Don’t forget that the PreOT can’t seethe meter, and the auditor must say what read, and must not let the Pre-OT overlist.) Youindicate the item by saying “Pc wording of the first reading item”) is the item”. Don’t getsloppy and say “That’s the item”, as how does he know what you mean by “that”? If“catfish” was the item say, “Catfish is the item”.Normally, but not always, you will get an F/N on finding and indicating the item,but if you do not get an F/N here, you will on the next step.(Warning: On this step remember that you may have already received the answerin Step 0 or Step 1. BTs and clusters may not be aware of the fact that they are living beingsand may not release any charge at all on “BT” or “cluster”. But when you ask where theyare, you may have gotten an answer to what they are being, simply by asking for bodylocations. This is not common, but not uncommon either: you asked if the BT was onhis foot and you got a big read. In this What step you might have trouble getting a readingitem and might miss the fact that you already had the reading item for his What step in“foot”. The BT was being a foot and you discovered it by accident without recognizingit, so if you have any trouble with the What step, one of the first things to check is whetheror not a “What” already read on asking for the “Where” on Step 0 or Step 1. If you suspectthis, put the named body part that read on the list and check it out as part of the list. Youwon’t have to do this often, but you better know about it.)3.AcknowledgementThe auditor has the Pre-OT acknowledge the item. This is very important (see"},{"pageNumber":477,"pageContent":"477NOTs Series 7).Even if you got an F/N on the previous step, you still acknowledge and you willbroaden the F/N. And if you didn’t get an F/N previously, you will on acknowledging theitem. And you’ll quite often get a blow on this step.4.“Who are you?”Now we have to remember that it is the same spot again and we ask, “Who are you?”,and we don’t feed them the answer. They sometimes comm lag (don’t get impatient withthe comm lag), sometimes it’s a few seconds comm lag, and then you get the answer. Youmay have to repeat the question. The “Me” answer will normally LFBD, and if that LFBDisn’t very marked, you make sure you do the next step of acknowledging the “Me” answer.In any event you could still acknowledge, but if the LFBD was pronouned the probabilityis that he’s gone.Now there is a special condition you can run into on the “Who are you?” questionif the BT answers with a significance or identity answer. This is covered in NOTs Series7. But if this continues, suspect that you may have gotten a wrong item on the “What areyou?” question, or that the Pre-OT has used too broad an attention span or let his attentionwander to other areas and he is getting answers from other BTs or Clusters.5.AcknowledgementThe auditor has the PreOT acknowledge the BT’s “Me”answer. This action canguarantee a blow.Now if this acknowledgement produces another read then we know it guaranteeda blow. Sometimes you get another LFBD on the acknowledgement step, and sometimesyou get a broadening of the F/N.And that completes the steps of the NOTs Valence Technique.CAUTIONSSometimes, quite often in fact, this short-circuits. You ask: “What are you?” andthe guy says “Me” and blows. And sometimes you are patiently trying to go through allthese steps and you get a series of blows. A blow or a series of blows can occur at anytime during NOTs. You don’t then continue the steps of this Technique, as that BT orcluster has gone! Sometimes a series of blows or an automatic blow will go into aPersistent F/N or a Floating Tone Arm and in either instance you would end off thesession.Also you can get repetitive blows if a case is running pretty clean, and you can getblows without BDs. There isn’t much left on the charge and it isn’t registering on themeter to amount to anything.There is also the case of a “partial blow” and the description and handling for thisis given in NOTs Series 45, HCOB 10 Feb 79 PARTIALLY BLOWN BTS.On “Hello and OK” you sometimes get a blow. The BT or cluster doesn’t answerup and you run “Hellos and OKs” repetitively to get it into comm. Rarely, it will suddenly"},{"pageNumber":478,"pageContent":"478blow, and it would then be senseless to go on trying to run “Hello and OK” or anythingelse, as that one has gone.Some auditors have been known to ask a pc if it blew, during the Valence Techniquesteps. Even nag the PreOT, “Did it blow?”, “Has it gone?”, “Still around?”. This couldbe due to the auditor’s unfamiliarity with his meter, and not recognizing a blow when hesees it occur on the meter. Or, possibly some may have confused another technique, Date/Locate, with this technique. You of course always Date to blow, and Locate to blow, andthe auditor could get the idea that he should carry over Date/Locate technique into theValence Technique.It is very poor practice to ask the PreOT if it blew during NOTs Valence Technique.You could cause the BT or cluster to submerge or be suppressed, or you could invalidatea blow that did occur.This doesn’t mean that you can’t ever ask if it blew. You could ask if it is “stillaround?” and a read would confirm that it is. But this type of question is asking for amissingness. It’s no longer there. There’s a large number of pcs that never see the blow,and it isn’t something to see, because it’s a missingness. This type of question can bedifficult for the PreOT to answer, as there is now nothing there for him to perceive as ithas gone. If the meter BD’d and F/Ned on the “Me” step, it would be idiocy to then askif it blew, of course it did! But if your meter didn’t tell you it blew, you could be in aquandary and have to solve that problem. But you wouldn’t interrupt the ValenceTechnique to ask if it blew, and you wouldn’t get into nagging the PreOT. You just followon through your steps, and particularly if you had the PreOT ack the “Me” answer, thenyou got your blow alright. So this concern about whether the BT blew is misplaced.These points are stated so that the auditor will understand what he is doing, why heis doing it, and what manifestation he can expect to occur, because these manifestationswill occur. This technique is a very positive series of steps, and they go in that sequence.If these steps are done as given, you will get the result, and if departed from or if there isan error, you can definitely expect to get that manifestation too, i.e. too broad an attentionspan and you will get restim.It is necessary that the auditor and C/S understand these points as this is not atechnique that can be done rotely or robotically.OT III TECHNIQUESSometimes you will need to use OT III techniques, especially when you run into acluster. And it is effective, just like it always was. You sometimes get into a situationwhere you have an inert mass. You run some “Hellos and OKs” and it actually becomesless inert, but it is still a cluster. That condition can exist but it usually isn’t untied with“Hello & OK”. It’s a cluster and it reads on cluster. Then it’s your assessment for mutualincident, “Accident?, Illness?, Impact?, Injury?, etc.”, you do the assessment of what isthis thing. You get your mutual incident. Sometimes the cluster will explode apart orbreak up on the assessment alone. You found what was holding it together. Then youwouldn’t try to Date/Locate it. You’d have the PreOT pick off individuals and run themon the Valence Technique. But if there was no disintegration of the cluster on finding themutual incident, you’d carry right on and Date/Locate, Inc II and Inc Is (or NOTs ValenceTechnique)."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"479Now there’s a variation on mutual incidents. You can get a mutual incident that iscurrent, contemporary, like he went PTS or something. Had a big ARC break orsomething. But it isn’t as strenuous as a cluster-making incident. It’s a sort of a lock. Itisn’t a mutual incident like an impact, injury, illness, accident, shock, etc. But a guy canrun into a recent heavy upset or general charge of some kind, heavy stress, and you getthe reaction described in HCOB 20 Dec 79 NOTs Series 48, under “Routine A”. Thereyou had a general total restim - it is actually a mutual incident as it happened to all of them- it’s near PT though and they all copy it, and when you hit it you get a sudden BD anda relief. But you are not going to blow any BTs to amount to anything as it isn’t a cluster-making incident. So you have to be able to differentiate between these two types of mutualincidents, the recent this life lock, and the heavy impact, injury, explosion type of mutualincident that forms a cluster. The cluster will resolve with the OT III, mutual incident,Date/Locate, Inc II and Inc Is routine. And that’s why you start off on the NOTs coursewith a re-study and clear up any MUs on the OT III materials. I wouldn’t do much date/locating on NOTs, and usually the cluster will break up into individuals on finding themutual incident pinning them together. Very often you can blow a cluster with the NOTsValence Technique, but you still have the assessment for what is holding the clustertogether, and it is very useful.The one that gives the most trouble is the cluster impacted with a cluster, impactedwith a cluster - a Cumulative Cluster. You also have the handling for that in HCOB 25Oct 69R CLUSTER FORMATION, CUMULATIVE. But some of these clusters can bepretty horrifying in character. I don’t think this would give any trouble in NOTs though,and I think by the time he’s gotten through OT III, handled all the individuals and availableBTs and clusters he’s got, that he may have blown these by then.Regarding the insane, the probability is that a cluster is really dominated by onethetan who has “contaged” the rest of the cluster with some wild ideas - evil intentions.That’s when you run into the R/Ser on NOTs. And you may get the intention come off,if so note it in the worksheets. I wouldn’t do more with it than that. You’re taking thecluster down to basic mutual incident and blowing it, so then it is gone anyway. But youmay have to get off the evil intention if it doesn’t just come flying off. The cluster couldbe held together by a mutual idea or evil intention received during an implant or heavyengram. In one instance an R/Sing cluster was listed for its evil intention, whichsuccessfully blew the cluster apart, and this could be done, but usually won’t have to beresorted to. More commonly when handling a cluster, an R/Sing cluster, you can run intothe phenomenon of evil intentions coming off voluntarily, and you will see a list startingup in the worksheets. This is called to your attention, so that you will recognize it if itoccurs and take the list to its BD F/N item. That can happen, and an auditor should be ableto recognize when a pc is listing and handle it as a list. XDN actually applies. The bulkof Rock Slammers are probably clusters, and probably it’s one main BT in the clusteraffecting the rest by wishing off his evil intention on them.COPIESHandling copies can be necessary, especially when you’ve taken apart a cluster. Orwhen you don’t get a clean blow and suspect that some other BT is copying what you justran or handled. But checking for copies can be easily over-worked, and as BTs are verysuggestible, you could by nagging the PreOT on the subject of copies, start some BT orBTs copying. You certainly don’t ask for copies after every BT you blow, or as a routinestep in the Valence Technique. Some auditors have tended to do this, probably by"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"480carrying Date/Locating technique over into the Valence Technique. In any case you onlyhandle copies when indicated, and not as a rote every time question.SOMATICSThe original research on somatics was done in the late ‘50’s in Washington, and Ifound how a somatic comes about. It’s based on the fact that one being by himself couldn’thave a somatic. You have to have two beings to have a somatic. A cluster can have asomatic. You wouldn’t ask a question for a BT with a somatic, that would be a wrongquestion and is based on a false datum, and is an out-tech question. You could have twoor more BTs smashed together somehow producing a somatic, but you would have to takeup each of these BTs individually to blow them.But usually about the only time you will run into a somatic in NOTs is when therehas been an error. A wrong item, or something of that sort. It may be that a somatic inNOTs is always an indicator of an error. It seems to be so. And the wise auditor on NOTsshould be alerted to the probability of an error of some kind if the Pre-OT does turn ona somatic. You can easily and quickly check for an error in what you have just beenrunning in the session, or use a NOTs Repair List to locate and handle the BPC.UNDERSTANDINGIt is very essential that NOTs auditors and C/Ses understand the NOTs materials,and don’t try to insist on a rote set of questions or steps, as NOTs doesn’t run well as arote or robotic rundown. There are very exact steps and manifestations and sequences andyou will get these everytime. Anytime there have been flubbed cases on NOTs these havetraced to MU’s on the part of the auditor and/or C/S. The NOTs course checksheet wasspecificially designed to prevent this with Supervisor meter checks for MU wordsfrequently throughout the checksheet. But there was an instance of a student who“skipped” the MU word check by the Supervisor, which is a sure route to catastrophe. Anytrouble on NOTs has traced back to failure to clear words misunderstood in either the OTIII materials or in the NOTs materials. This gives the solution to any auditor or C/Stroubles with NOTs. Clear the MU words, and re-study the materials so that you dounderstand and can apply them. It will certainly make your life as an auditor or C/S mucheasier, and will enable you to get the rave results that NOTs is known for routinely.SOCIOLOGICAL IMPACTHave you considered the sociological impact that you are having by auditing NOTs?You are turning free beings loose in torrents. This is bound to have an effect on society,especially when these start picking up bodies and turn up to join the team at their local org!You are not just auditing one pc at this level, you are churning out cleared beings involume, and we will start seeing the results sooner or later on society in general. Maybeyou have thought about this too, it’s nice to recognize the good effects you are creating!LRH:dm:kjmL. RON HUBBARDCopyright (c) 1980FOUNDERby L.

(The OT III handlings of drugs can also be used on NOTs cases.)As you know from NOTs data, BTs can be being anything. They can be being aparticular drug, or being a drug picture or incident, or even an “acid trip” for example.The way you would handle a NOTs case on drugs is similar in that you would firstof all get the person through the Purification Rundown. A case already started on NOTscan be put onto the Purification RD without having been completed on NOTs, in fact, youmay not be able to complete some cases without it. You do not have to take the case toa Rest Point. Just ensure that the case is not left incomplete (or messed up) on a specificaction or category before starting the Purification RD. Then do not attempt to combineNOTs auditing with the Purification RD until it is completed.Do not attempt to run Objective processes on a case during NOTs.The caution of not asking for Drugs or Drug incidents generally also applies toNOTs auditing as such a question would result in a total restim.What you can do is to add “Drugs” and “a BT being a drug”, “a BT affected bydrugs”, “a BT being a drug trip”, “a BT being a drug picture”, into a prepared assessmentor list.You can check for a read on drugs on a specific BT or cluster, and then handle that"},{"pageNumber":482,"pageContent":"482BT or cluster to a blow.All of the data published on the subject of drugs and their effect in preventing casegain applies to BT’s and cluster’s cases.Most commonly drugs have shown up on NOTs cases as either cluster-makingincidents, or on individual BTs being the drug or affected by the drug, or copying otherBT or cluster pictures of drugs.Several cases who were stalled on NOTs or who were making minimal gain onNOTs have been resolved by handling drugs as described in this issue.CASE HISTORIESThe following case histories (reported by FSO C/Ses), of case handlings done onNOTs Pre-OTs on drugs are limited to this issue as they contain NOTs techniques anddata. These are additional case histories to those given in HCOB 29 Jan 80, THE OTDRUG RUNDOWN, (those cases were also piloted by NOTs auditors and C/Ses, but donot contain confidential NOTs data).Case 1:“Institutional case who had Sodium Pentathol as an anaethetic just prior to ‘goingnuts’ and then being put in an institution”.“Running NOTs techniques on this drug, BTs stuck in this drug, BTs being thisdrug, BTs affected by this drug, turned the case sane.”Case 2:“LSD some 200 times. Had so far refused any standard Sweat Out program. Casegain totally hung fire on his attempts to get the perception he had when he took LSD.”“From a GF 40 Expanded, drugs read heavily and his first gains from NOTs wereacheived in handling cluster-making incidents from LSD trips, BTs/clusters stuck inLSD, being LSD, etc. This was run for approximately one intensive with Pre-OT interest.It didn’t crack the case but some headway was made.”(The next action for this case is to get him onto and through the Purification RD, thenthe full NOTs OT Drug RD.)Case 3:“LSD 220 to 250 times, and alcohol and other heavy street drugs. He was at a pointwhere he could hardly walk or articulate”.“Many cluster-making incidents on drugs, LSD, alcohol, were handled through theRundown. Many were Reviv’d in past locations and some stuck there (i.e. physically)”.“He cognited and BD’d on disturbing a pocket of acid held down by a BT. BTs/clusters restimulated by that were handled, then BTs/clusters stuck in drug trips and"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"483copies of drug trips”.“He started recovering physically. Articulation handled and walking improved”.“On NOTs Series 34 handling of illness, alcohol was the item. His speech went backto normal after this - Pre-OT felt tremendous”.“Lots of charge blown on BTs/clusters stuck in hospital drug (ACTH). Result of lessnumb, more sensation”.“Later a NOTs Series 43 handling was done on alcohol, plus Date/Locate of acumulative cluster on drugs. His responsibility increased and he was off on a persistentwin for almost 2 weeks experiencing automatic/continuous blow phenomena in life”.“Lots of ‘stuckness’ on the case was tied up in drugs and alcohol. Case is currentlydoing very well on the Purification RD”.(Although the Purification RD would normally precede such drug handling inNOTs, this case was unable to walk or to talk due to paralysis and was consideredincurable by the medicos.)___________“There are also a number of Pre-OTs who have had NOTs Series 12 handlings onDrug RDs and some on drugs.”___________NOTs OT DRUG RD PGMThe NOTs OT Drug RD Program is the same program as the OT Drug RD (HCOB29 Jan 80 THE OT DRUG RUNDOWN). It begins with the Purification RD, it has thesame Steps #1 - 5. But the method of handling is by NOTs Valence Technique, rather thanInc II, Inc I. Assessment for mutal incident is the same, but individuals from a broken upcluster would be handled with NOTs Valence Technique.The categories of: “a BT or cluster being (reading drug)”, “a BT or cluster affectedby (reading drug)”, “a BT being a drug trip”, “a BT being a drug picture”, “a BT or clusterbeing (mis-emotion)”, “a BT or cluster being (negative item)”, should also be checkedfor on each reading drug taken up, and these categories may be assessed as part of aprepared list, and should be so assessed at the end of Step 5.Step 6 is different and would consist of a NOTs Series 24 Repair List assessed andhandled, to clean up any loose ends and polish off the case, before returning to the NOTsAdvance Program.ADMINISTRATION AND DELIVERYThe OT Drug Rd may not be audited on Pre-0Ts who have had any NOTs auditing,"},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"484these may only be run on the NOTs OT Drug RD.Although the NOTs OT Drug RD is done by a NOTs auditor and NOTs C/S, thesemust be specially trained on the NOTs OT Drug RD and only interested, graduated NOTsauditors and C/Ses may be so trained. (These issues are not added to the ACS Courses,nor given to green NOTs auditors or C/Ses.)The NOTs OT drug Rundown is not mixed in with the NOTs Advance Program, noris it to be bit and pieced with NOTs, nor given as a blur along with NOTs. It is its ownspecial RD and must be delivered as its own RD, and as its own package. This does notmean that you cannot use the item “drugs” in an assessment for a mutual incident duringNOTs, nor that you couldn’t handle a BT hung up in a drug during NOTs. But if drugsor drug items are coming up during NOTs, then the case is on the wrong program andshould be shifted over to the Purification RD, followed by the NOTs OT Drug RD. Thenafter these are done, you would resume the NOTs Advance Program. (As well as notmixing the hours on the NOTs OT Drug RD with NOTs hours, there is an importantTechnical reason for only handling one subject at a time and completing each action andprogram before starting another. (ref: C/S Series 38, C/S Series 47, & NOTs Series 30.)One would not interrupt a Pre-OT who is running well on NOTs with good TAaction and who is getting rapid blows, but would flatten the action before making a changeto the Purification RD and the NOTs OT Drug RD. These Rundowns can be done at anypoint during the NOTs Advance Program, but ideally they would be entered after the “PastAuditing Repair” steps, or after step 14, after step 15, or at any point thereafter. If drugsare heavily charged and getting in the way, then you would have no choice but to shiftprograms to handle.Ideally the NOTs OT Drug RD should be delivered by a specialist team of NOTsauditors and C/S, operating as a unit, who then feed completed cases back to regular andinterning NOTs auditors.The NOTs OT Drug Rundown should help you with cases who hung fire or wereresistive previously as well as speeding gains and results on all cases.The pilot results are excellent, and show what sort of gains can be attained.L.

It does not otherwise cancel or change the restof the NOTs Valence Technique, nor does it changethe rest of the NOTs procedures or Rundown. Thisissue must be thoroughly word cleared and star-rated along with the referenced issues by NOTsauditors and C/Ses to qualify them to use the NOTsWhat/Who L & N Step.)THE RIGHT ITEM, ON THE WHAT L & N STEPIn NOTs Series 47 and 49 it is stated that you take “the first reading item” (regardless ofits read). In experience I have found this not always to be true. One can get some small falls onseveral items before the real item is hit. Sometimes it requires an ack to get an F/N, but the realitem always F/Ns.(E-meter Note: If one were to use other than an operational Mark VI, one could be misleadby the meter. I have noticed that what is a small fall (sF) on an operational Mark VI, is a fall (F)on another meter. This is not good, as the auditor seeing a fall (F), could think he has the item,when it is really a small fall. The exaggerated read makes one think wrong items have read whenthese only gave a small fall. Also, the Mark V tends to just F/N, and gives on the problem of tryingto read through an F/N. The Mark V is not sensitive enough. Thus it is essential that anoperational Mark VI is used. The sizes of reads referred to here are at the correct Sensitivitysetting of one third dial drop on can squeeze per EM-5R."},{"pageNumber":487,"pageContent":"487The Sensitivity must not be higher than this during the What/Who L & N Steps.)The statements in NOTs Series 47 and 49 under Step 3 (Acknowledgement) are correct andthe only change here is in the statement that you take “the first reading item”, plus a clarificationof size of read.The right What? L & N Step reads are a lot of small falls preceding the right item. THEREAL ITEM ALWAYS F/Ns (even if it sometimes requires an ack to get it to F/N).THE “WHO” STEP(Early in the NOTs Rundown, and sometimes later in the Rundown, the being blows easily.Often before all the Valence Technique steps have been done, frequently blowing on inspection.There is the phenomenon (described in earlier NOTs issues) of the cyclic aspect of handling moredifficult-to-blow BTs and clusters, followed by a series of easy/rapid blows. Later in theRundown, after the more available and easier-to-blow BTs and clusters have gone, thoseremaining tend to be in worse shape as beings. You are then more frequently going to encounterthe following phenomenon.)The being seldom gets much of a read and seldom a blow on the first right answer to theWho? question. It gives an answer, the right answer (“Me”), in many cases and there’s no realread. What one does then is ack encouragingly and asks it to repeat the answer (“Me”). Thusencouraged, a BD F/N and blow on the repeated answer occurs.PIN-POINTING ATTENTIONIt is essential that the NOTs PreOT limits his/her attention to the BT/cluster beingaddressed. You can get a mish-mash if their attention goes onto something else. I have developedTR 8-Q (HCOB 22 Apr 80) which is an exercise in pin-pointing attention as well as asking aquestion. Requiring a NOTs PreOT to do TR 8-Q will remedy this.REPAIR LISTS FOR L & NThere are two repair lists for L & N errors that are shorter than the L4BRA, and both of thesecan be used in NOTs. They are: HCOB 23 Sep 68 “Violation of the Laws of Listing and Nulling”,and HCOB 29 Sep 68 “List Correction” (Tech Vol XI, pages 44, 45), and either of these may beused, resorting to the longer L4BRA when necessary. The usual thing to do though would be torecognize what was wrong from the reads noted in W/Ss (or lack of F/N on the What? item), andhandle accordingly and as given in earlier NOTs issues.FES-INGFESers and C/Ses must know the materials given in NOTs Series 47, 49 and this issue andmust inspect worksheets to see whether correct (or wrong) items have been found, and whetherthe BT or cluster was blown. C/Ses must do this on every session, and FESers when they arelooking for errors on a case. Any previous instances of failure to get the right item, or failure tohandle a being to a blow can then be taken up in subsequent sessions and properly handled asdescribed in this issue. If the BT/cluster is still around it will read when the PreOT’s attentionis directed to that position (area) and oriented to the item given in that session. (Remember thatit now may be Suppressed or Invalidated, and that the being probably has a Wrong Item and anIncomplete List.) If the error can be found and corrected immediately, do so (such as simplycompleting the list to correct item, and completing the steps on that being to blow), or, do oneof the L & N Repair assessments to find what is wrong and then correct it and handle the being to blow."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"488AUDITOR AND C/S QUALIFICATIONSThe requirements for an auditor or C/S to use this NOTs L & N technique as given in NOTsSeries 47 and 49 are very important and it is a High Crime to violate these. ONLY auditors andC/Ses who can L & N successfully may be permitted to use this technique, and then only afterthey have completed the stated requirements in NOTs 47, 49, the referenced materials and thisissue. Until then, they may only use the other NOTs techniques, but not the L & N Step.PROGRAMMING THE WHAT/WHO L & N STEPNote that in NOTs Series 47, page 3, under “Warning” it is stated: “...it will be necessaryto use this technique of listing for the item, at some point on any case being audited on NED forOTs,...”. PreOTs being started on NOTs should not be put onto this technique at the beginningof the NOTs Advance Program, nor until the PreOT is well advanced through the Program. Theother NOTs techniques are fully adequate and very successful and most of the NOTs 26RProgram can be done before resorting to the NOTs L & N technique.Only shift to the L & N procedure when the PreOT is well advanced through the Programand encounters the phenomenon described in NOTs 47, page 1. Early in the NOTs Program thecase is fat with charge that will slough off easily and with the use of NOTs techniques other thanthe listing technique given in NOTs Series 47. On a case that has been prematurely started onthe L & N Step, prefer to use the earlier NOTs techniques and do not overwork the L & N Stepuntil the case is ready for it, (this doesn’t mean that one would stop the L & N technique altogetheron such a case).When the case is ready for the NOTs What/Who L & N Step, and provided the auditor andC/S are qualified to run it, then the case is indoctrinated on the procedure and begun (per NOTs47, 49 and this issue). If all the NOTs auditors and C/Ses are not fully qualified, then the PreOTcould be reassigned when ready for the L & N Step.In general most cases will follow the steps as laid out on NOTs 26R and 27, as this is theresearch/developmental sequence of NOTs and most cases will follow the same sequence andpattern and phenomena.NOTs trainees should also follow this same sequence and only train on the later techniquesafter they have had experience and wins on auditing the earlier NOTs Program steps with theearlier techniques. Those are very easy to do, very rewarding and will enable the new NOTsauditor to gain familiarity and confidence.L.

Even if you got an F/N on theanswer, you still acknowledge and you will broaden the F/N.We ask “Who are you?” to the same spot and we don’t feed them the answer. Theysometimes comm lag, (don’t get impatient with the comm lag), sometimes it’s a few secondscomm lag, and then you get the answer. You may have to repeat the question (see NOTs Series7). The “Me” answer will normally LFBD, and if that LFBD isn’t very marked, you make sureyou do the next step of acknowledging the “Me” answer. In any event you could stillacknowledge, but if the LFBD was pronounced the probability is that he’s gone. The auditorhaving the Pre-OT acknowledge the “Me” answer can guarantee a blow. Now is thisacknowledgement produces another read then we know it guaranteed a blow. Sometimes youget another LFBD on the acknowledgement step, and sometimes you get a broadening of theF/N.CAUTIONSSometimes, quite often in fact, this short-circuits. You ask: “What are you?” and the guysays “Me” and blows. And sometimes you are patiently trying to go through all these steps andyou get a series of blows. A blow or a series of blows can occur at any ime during NOTs. Youdon’t then continue the steps of this Technique, as that BT or cluster has gone! Sometimes aseries of blows or an automatic blow will go into a Persistant F/N or a Floating Tone Arm andin either instance you would end off the session.Also you can get repetitive blows if a case is running pretty clean, and you can get blowswithou BDs. There isn’t much left on the charge and it isn’t registering on the meter to amountto anything."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"490On “Hello and OK” you sometimes get a blow. The BT or cluster doesn’t answer up andrun “Hellos and OKs” repetitively to get it into comm. Rarely, it will suddenly blow, and itwould then be senseless to go on trying to run “Hello and OK”, or anything else, as that one hasgone.Some auditors have been known to ask a pc if it blew, during the Valence Technique steps.Even nag the Pre-OT, “Did it blow?”, “Has it gone?”, “Still around?”. This could be due to theauditor’s unfamiliarity with his meter, and not recognizing a blow when he sees it occur on themeter. Or, possibly some may have confused another technique, Date/Locate, with thistechnique. You of course always Date to blow, and Locate to blow, and the auditor could getthe idea that he should carry over Date/Locate technique into Valence Technique.It is very poor practice to ask the Pre-OT if it blew during NOTs Valence Technique. Youcould cause the BT or cluster to submerge or be suppressed, or you could invalidate a blow thatdid occur.This doesn’t mean that you can’t ever ask if it blew. You could ask if it is “still around?”and a read would confirm that it is. But this type of question is asking for a missingness. It isno longer there. There’s a large percentage of pcs that never see the blow, and it isn’t somethingto see, because it’s a missingness. This type of question can be difficult for the Pre-OT toanswer, as there is now nothing there for him to perceive as it has gone. If the meter BD’d andF/Ned on the “Me” step, it would be idiocy to then ask if it blew, of course it did! But if yourmeter didn’t tell you it blew, you could be in a quandary and have to solve that problem. Butyou wouldn’t interrupt the Valence Technique to ask if it blew, and you wouldn’t get intonagging the Pre-OT. You just follow on through with your steps, and particularly if you hadthe Pre-OT ack the “Me” answer, then you got your blow alright. So this concern about whetherthe BT blew is misplaced. These points are stated so that the auditor will understand what he is doing, why he isdoing it, and what manifestations he can expect to occur, because these manifestations willoccur. This technique is a very positive series of steps, and they go in that sequence. If thesesteps are done as given, you will get the result, and if departed from or if there is an error, youcan definitely expect to get that manifestation too, i.e. too broad an attention span and you willget restim.It is necessary that the auditor and C/S understand these points as this is not a techniquethat can be done rotely or robotically.L.

Then, that listed,handled and blown, one can go back to the head.The operating rule that seems best is not to work the same area twice in succession.One also must be sure to work behind as well as in front and from different angles fromin front and behind. By continuing to work from the front only, on and on, builds up an imbalancethat can increase duress.One also must remember to not always work close in: from time to time check out areasthat are as much as many feet from the body.When one has worked one, two or three areas, one is likely to get a persistent F/N, verywide, and that is the time to lay off for now, end session and begin again later - in a few hoursor next day. If you keep plugging on after a good win, you are actually overrunning a persistentF/N and it clears up by simply indicating that.Forcing forward past a good win can give you a temporary pack up; so you actually makeless progress than you would have if you short-sessioned as you are supposed to.L.

Not only does this put the OT on a withhold of confidential data, but a personof lower case level has no reality on the materials of the case level of the OT and can easilystir up aspects of the case that should have been left alone, or, if taken up handled fully.Additionally if the OT did get messed up, then he could only be repaired by using Repairactions appropriate to his case level. A non-OT III Cramming Officer or auditor could notpossibly repair BPC on an OT III.Where Cramming Officers have limited their actions to simply word clearing thematerials that the person had gone past misunderstoods on, it has worked out OK. But if theaction being done led into the person’s case then there is a liability of messed up case andineffective staff member.Some of the Qual corrective actions such as False Data Stripping and some of thequestions on the Product Debug Checklist are not directed toward the person’s post alone butare directed towards the person’s case by asking about intentions or reactions or considera-tions or directing the person to recall past events. The statement: “I’m not auditing you.”,doesn’t prevent a case action from occurring if one then proceeds to ask auditing questions."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"495The worst repercussions of all have stemmed from offline case actions done as somesort of squirrelly “2WC” which wasn’t a valid part of the cramming action anyway.When subjective questions are asked one invariably is into a case action. Definition of“Subjective”: “Consultation with the preclear’s own universe, with his mock ups, and withhis own thoughts and considerations.” (Book THE CREATION OF HUMAN ABILITY, p.167.) “Recall, think, remember or return on the time track processes are subjective.” (HCOB2 Nov 57RA.)Subjective actions, especially when metered, lead into the person’s case. If mis-done,particularly if mis-metered, these can ball the case up.OTs when correctly handled with the corrrect tech appropriate to their case level,handle very quickly and easily. So it is important to know what to do and what not to do.The solution to this is in having specialized lists for OTs, and forbidding the use of non-OT actions on OTs, and forbidding non-OTs from seeking to audit or cram OTs.REPAIR OF OTs MESSED UP IN CRAMMINGThe most frequent cause of BPC encountered is:(a) Misownership,(b) Mismetering (false reads, missed reads and missed F/Ns),(c) Invalidation of state of case.There are two types of action which are most likely to lead into an OT’s case and causeBPC:(i)Asking subjective questions,(ii)Asking “earlier similar?” (which sends the Pre-OT down the track, or down differenttracks.)There are ways to detect and isolate what happened in a mis-done cramming:-The person crammed has “any” BIs about the cramming action;-The person continues to goof in the same area or subject;-The person Reg Tags on the cramming or within three days after the cramming action;-The person gets sick, misemotional on the subject of the cram, or turns on somatics,within three days after the cramming action;-The person is introverted on the subject of the cram;-The person comes to next session after the cram with TA or needle behavior worsenedfrom what it was prior to the cram, (such as TA used to be in normal range and now ishigh or low, or Sens setting for 1/3rd dial drop on can squeeze is now higher due totighter needle, an unusual needle patern has now appeared, etc.)."},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"496A sharp C/S can usually spot a mis-done cram from the worksheets of the crammingaction and must insist that these are legible and accurate (ref: HCOB C/S Series 98AUDITING FOLDERS, OMISSIONS IN COMPLETENESS).When encountering any of the above, the C/S should make up a prepared assessmentto cover points of possible error in the cramming action. Here is a sample assessment whichcan be used or added to:1. R Factor:“I’m going to assess a list of possibleerrors which may have occurred in the(cramming action), to locate any BPC.”2. Assess:“Was there any misownership of charge?”“Were significances or reads misowned?”“Was there any mismetering?”“Was a false read taken up?”“Was there any cleaned clean?”“Was a read missed?”“Was an F/N missed?”“Was there any invalidation of state of case?”“Were subjective questions asked?”“Were earlier similars asked for when these did not exist?”“Were there any out-ruds?”“Was there no help?”(The above is a sample assessment which contains the most common items you arelikely to find on mis-done cramming actions, especially on OTs, and the assessment aboveis designed for use on cases who are OT III or above only as it contains “misownership”, buta similar prepared assessment could be made up for a lower level case.)3.Handle reads on the above assessment in accordance with HCOB 4 July 79 HAN-DLING CORRECTION LISTS ON OTs and HCOB 22 Dec 79 FLYING RUDS AT OT IIIAND ABOVE.

Thisis always safe and OK to do. (The only other caution is not to give verbal data, nor to evaluateor invalidate or throw the person’s ruds out while doing the cram!)Word Clearing Methods 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are OK to do on OTs (but not MethodOne, which asks for “earlier similar?”).Finding and clearing Crashing Misunderstood Wrods is OK.Demonstrating meanings or words and terms and principles either with a demo kit oron Clay Table are OK.Starrate checkouts on materials are OK.Product Debug Tech is OK to do on OTs (provided the subjective questions on theassessments are omitted).All of the actions given in this section can and should be used in Cramming, and thesehave no liability.OTs when handled correctly in Cramming (or in auditing) are very fast and easy tohandle, and correct very readily.L.

This too is not good sense.One can explain it by saying that thetans become bored and have “a yearning for event orexcitement” or that thetans mock up pictures as an aberrated form of “havingness.” Other wayscan be invented to explain why thetans compulsively mock up bad pictures, but these do notfactually lead to a total solution to the compulsion.The real reason stems from a basic characteristic of thetans and that is “a thetan nevertotally gives up.”There is, seemingly, a streak of resistance or resentment that makes a thetan wish to persistin the same place or location. If he cannot, he will do so covertly.The definition of “power” is “the ability to hold a position in space.” All power comes fromthe ability to occupy a point. In an electrical generator the base that separates two terminals mustbe firm or there will be no exchange of energy or power generated.The effort to weaken a thetan is to make him relinquish his point in space. Covertly orovertly a thetan seeks to assert his position in space. If he cannot do so overtly, he does so covertlyor mentally.When a thetan is moved unwillingly from a point or position he even then refuses to giveup that point and begins MOCKS IT UP mentally. He also mocks up the events of his departureas a part of the action of mocking up the point he is leaving. This, unwittingly, gives him a picture,an engram.Now let us see if this theory holds true in practice.A.Just ahead of any engram there must be an effort to retain a position and there mustbe a point or location thetan mocked up.This is true. You can blow an engram without running it by spotting its first pointin space and time. In a secondary, “where did you first hear of the loss?” is a vital question.B.In a contact assist getting a person to touch again the point where he was hurt withwhat was hurt will blow the engram.C.Getting a person to locate areas (locations) that are not safe produce blows ofengrams without running them."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"518D.Exact and accurate dating sometimes blows an engram. Those times when it doesnot, it should blow when the location is exactly spotted.E.Implants and traps were done mainly to keep Thetans out of an area. The Thetan,resenting and resisting, mocks up the place anyway and so implants himself.A thetan too easily substitutes a mental mock up for a point in the real universe.One could also say that a thetan, by mocking up, warns himself against certain points inspace or areas in the physical universe.Anxiety is solely not thetan able to be certain places and not thetan able to be where oneis, either.Making people leave is the most unpopular action unless one also frees them to beanywhere.Transferring people is a degrading thing to do to them.Jail denies a thetan all spaces except where he has been placed; note that thetans are madevery miserable in jail. Jailing is a sure way to make confirmed criminals and also to make themcrazy as well.Any thetan, stuck in an engram, is asserting the effort to be at and hold the point where hewas hit at the beginning of that engram.An engram therefore is a refusal to leave a place at which force was exerted to drive oneaway.Reversely, one can refuse to be held at a place where one does not wish to be but this is anegation of a place, a not-is of it and its time.Power of choice over where one is and where one is not is thus a key to engrams.Finally - a thetan mocks up because he covertly refuses to abandon a location under duressand not-ises the place where he does not wish to be but must.Using these facts one can blow engrams without running them.Some sample questions:“What point (location) is unsafe?”“What location could you have held absolutely?”“Where did you first get an intimation of danger?”“What place would you rather not be in?”“What effort would it take to hold (that) (a) location?”Working with this you will see a door open to a higher level than Dianetic R3R. But realizethat it is only for a high level thetan.LRH: rsL. RON HUBBARDCopyright (c) 1969FOUNDERBy L.

Security there is very tightwith detectors at the doors so that no original data can be removed. This debrief issomething the Independent Field/Free Zone Scientology has been waiting many years tosee. It is not the original nor is it a perfect record but it is accurate and will get the resultif followed by a competent solo auditor who is flat on all earlier levels with all overts off.The wording of the processes are exact to the best of my recall and the procedures are exactfor sure. Any differences are extremely minor (if at all). I spent several weeks reconstruct-ing all this from memory (needless to say I have an excellent memory as a result of therundown). I am breaking security as I disagree that this should only be released to an elitein Scientology. I do, however, ask it not be released to psyches or “squirrels” or anyonewho will break the Independent Security Network and allow it to get back to the Churchof Scientology. It would be best if they do not find out that we have it. Please treat thisdata responsibly. It is the key to the only truth possible.The whole secret involves what truly is the relationship of the Supreme Being toeach individual thetan. To simply say it’s “me” is oversimplified to tears but has sometruth to it. The real key is the perception and ability to have full certainty and, therefore,perception on all confusions and distortions of MEST and form and life units as well asthe ability to perceive exact identity and its full relationship to its true source and historyfrom its origin as the theta body, the true 8th Dynamic In order to truly view this as apresent time beingness one has to clean up, once and for all, his own confusions regardingthese points. The key is being flat on all earlier levels and being honest with self as to thetruth on each step of the rundown.In doing this procedure one has to acknowledge the lie of time and persistance andthe lie of the illusion that MEST is solid and unchangable. Another key given is the factthat a being can exist independent of time and present time and can choose any point onthe track as his present time. The PT body can confuse this, as attention to some degreeis always hung up on the PT body. This fixes the thetan into one present time and one timestream when in fact there are many as you will discover.Do not attempt this rundown if you are incomplete on any earlier level, incompleteon or in need of “sec checks,” involved in any out ethics, PTS or involved in any pressingPT situations that call your attention back to this present time. If you are in need of reviewon any point above, get it before starting the rundown or it will miss and be meaninglessor wasted.If your attention is in any way governed by OT 7 (NOTS) or earlier materials on OTlevels, this rundown will miss and be wasted. This also goes for out int. If int/ext is aconcern at all, get reviewed and flattened on OT 1 to 7 before attempting this rundown.The techniques involve simple spotting techniques as in R2 processes or straightwirereferences."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"524Step One:Read and word clear Handbook for Preclears cover to cover.Step Two:Do all steps and exercises in the above book and note reads on anyterminals or items [presumably these are used in review or higher levelslater].

Thesuccess of the L’s is startling. These rundowns can handle things that are handlednowhere else.The breakthrough which exists here technically is so strong that it actually cutsthrough the normal protective mechanisms of the mind. It came actually from the OTGrades. It answers the question - Why does an OT restrain himself and cease to behaveas an OT?Each rundown is designed to terminatedly handle a specific area of a person’s case.The L’s are not grades in themselves but incredible boosters. The basic tech comes fromresearch into increasing OT powers. They’re a special class of rundown; they increase aperson’s power and effectiveness.Part of the discovery was that this tech could be used lower down on the Bridge toget people up it faster - very much faster.The L’s address the basics of a thetan’s case directly. They undercut the reactivemind and handle those factors which suppress the capacity to actually Do, Be and Have.They remove those things that can make a person less himself and far less powerful andcausative as a thetan. These rundowns are designed to find and erase the basic counterintentions along one’s dynamics. They stabilize a case.The L’s require an expert to run them. The auditor’s TRs have to be perfect and thereis no room for flubs. So don’t audit these rundowns on a PC or PreOT until your auditingis flawless.SETUPIn all the “L” Rundowns (L10, L11, and L12) the PC or PreOT is fully set up firstwith a C/S 53 and GF40 expanded if needed.METHOD 6The L type of assessment is Method 6.Method 6 is addressed directly to the thetan, not to the bank. The auditor looksdirectly at the pc and says the question or item. That bypasses bank protective mecha-nisms.A question is asked as a question, going up in the end as in regular assessment TRs.However, on most of the L rundowns we are assessing in a declarative manner.Declarative is when one goes down in pitch rather than up at the end. Going through a listof possible valences we would declare each one directly to the pc with full intention. Weare not asking, we are looking for a reaction on that item. Earlier M6 was done in anaccusative manner. That was later revised to be a declarative manner."},{"pageNumber":534,"pageContent":"534PURPOSE OF THE L’sThe Ls are intended to handle out-valence and evil purpose cases. We are handlingmain areas of resistiveness that are stopping the person from expanding. On L10 wehandle the main valences that make him restrain his havingness. On L11 we handle evilpurposes that keep him from acting. On L12 we stabilize his certainty of being himself.The 3 Ls roughly divide into Have (L10), Do (L11), and Be (L12).Our main targets are past identities and evil purposes. We will gradually make theperson realize that they are not him and thereby free him from them.The Ls are tailored to the individual. Every pc might not need all the steps, some pcsneed extra steps. Particularly L10 doesn’t have a fixed program, but contains a numberof different possible ways of getting items."},{"pageNumber":535,"pageContent":"535L 10"},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"536HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO POLICY LETTER OF 23 OCTOBER 1971Flag OnlyClass X OnlyOnly a full Class Xmay type or run offL-10 lists or materialsCLASS X CHECKSHEETFOR L-10 (EXPORT)C O N F I D E N T I A LNAME:____________________________DATE STARTED: ____________________ORG: _____________________________DATE COMPLETED:_________________This course ma be taught only in an official Org which is qualified and specificallyauthorized to teach it.Pre-requisite is successful completion and Internship of all levels up to andincluding Class IX.Full completion of this checksheet including the auditing requirements entitles thestudent to the award of Class X Certificate.Note: Students must be twinned in pairs.

The personregains his ability and power to do those things he intends to do and as a result he feelsmore at cause than ever before. L10 is an action that really releases a person’s power onthe third and fourth dynamic. It takes off the stops that hold a person back on thesedynamics.L10 will boost the individual’s confront and responsibility level and consequentlyraise his doingness level.PREREQUISITES: L10 is not restricted to only those who have completed OT III.The only prerequisites to L10 are a complete NED Drug R/D and Expanded Grades. Itmay not be done in the Non-interference Zone between Grade VI R6EW and OTIII.Note - All assessing is done M-6 (the L10 method of assessing a list).

His reach (havingness) is increased.L10 BASIC APPROACH0)Handle any identities the pc is assuming when he goes into session. Any fixedvalences he uses to be audited with.1)2WC for areas the pc has difficulty with or terminals he has trouble handling.2)Get an identity or terminal associated with the area. The way we do that depends onthe pc’s reality. On a higher level pc we can ask for identities that would representthe area, for lower level pc we might just ask for an identity associated with the area.Use whatever concept that communicates best: Identity, Valence, Character,Beingness, etc. If pc lists we would go to a BD F/N item. “Who or What would have___?” can be used. If pc gives “Me” as an identity: get it translated into a descriptionof the identity. If it isn’t possible, use “Me” in the steps anyway.3)O/Ws on item:1. “What has a ____ done?”2. “What has a ____ withheld?”We do this to unburden the item so that we can get to the basic purpose of it.4)L&N for basic purpose / basic intention of the item:“What is the basic purpose or intention of _____?”Date to blow / Locate to blow this purpose if evil."},{"pageNumber":549,"pageContent":"5495)If not completely handled / still some attention on the identity, 2wc or L&N:“What identity would oppose (the item)?”Same handle: 3)-5).

A dumbbellis an exercise device with two large weighted ends on a handle. One could perceive thevalence of the PTS (his own valence) and that of his suppressor (the valence he tends togo into) as opposite ends of a dumbbell. One can perceive a pc flick into his own valencewhen the antagonistic valence is blown. This could be described as the dumbbell suddenlyreversing.It must be remembered that it is not the actual valence of the suppressor that theperson goes into, but the valence the PTS perceives. Whether this is what the suppressoris normally like, or is like now, the fact remains that the PTS was overwhelmed by a flowfrom that person at some point.Oddly enough, the PTS who is out-of-valence will perceive his own personalitytraits as being those of the one with whom he has swapped valences — the other end ofthe dumbbell.A young girl who is essentially being cooperative and accommodating is over-whelmed by her nasty, irascible, argumentative stepmother. She assumes the character-istics which seemed to win over her and becomes fractious, irascible, and argumentative.If you were to ask her who was the most accommodating, cooperative person sheever knew she might easily answer, “My stepmother”. After a moment’s reflection shemight then realize, “Wait! My stepmother wasn’t accommodating at all! She was the mostirascible person I ever met!” This would be an example of the dumbbell of own-valenceversus perceived-valence now swinging around to a correct perception from the pc’s ownvalence .The access to this central point on the case is through using a gradient of 2 WayCommunications, Rudiments, and R3RA."},{"pageNumber":585,"pageContent":"585TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUESThe opening 2WC technique used was simply to thoroughly clear the definition ofproblem — including beingness-counter beingness — as described in the tech dictionary.With this whole concept clearly understood, a 2WC Quad on Problems was used to locatehot terminals.“Tell me about people who have caused you problems in life”“Tell me about people whom you have caused problems in life”“Tell me about people who have caused others problems in life”“Tell me about times you caused yourself problems in life”Each would be TWC’d to cog FN VGIs, and careful note would be made ofterminals who read, and with what read.These terminals would be culled between sessions and put on a hot terminals list inthe front cover of the folder.Quad Ruds would be run on hot terminals found and these ruds would uncover hotincidents. These would be noted with their reads on a separate sheet as hot incidents.These engrams or secondary engrams would then be run R3RA as narratives.TWO-WAY COMMING TRAITSA second type of TWC was done in pairs, and was based on characteristics orpersonality traits dramatized by the individual.These were done as dichotomies, with the negative side of the dichotomy being2WCd first. For example one has a PC who is constantly showing characteristics of beinghopeless, apathetic, or lethargic. A typical pair of 2WCs might go:“Tell me about people you’ve known who were lethargic”“Tell me about people you’ve known who were very active”followed by this pair:“Tell me about people you’ve known who were hopeless and apathetic”“Tell me about people who were optimistic and confident”The point is that the two-way comms pick up the personality trait the pc isdramatizing, and two way comms for people who have had that trait. It can be anycharacteristic. General doingnesses could also be included as these are traits of a valencein some degree — e.g., “helped others” vs. “did others in” or “had a high sense of ethics”versus “had a negative ethics level”.The idea here is to use aspects of beingness as a lead to hot terminals.Cull the hot terminals and do ruds on them and the pc will drop into hot incidents.These are then run and the result of doing this with intelligence and accuracy is aswing back into own valence."},{"pageNumber":586,"pageContent":"586OTHER TWO-WAY COMMSSince you are dealing with the perceived valence of the person versus the perceivedvalence of his/her suppressor you can also do TWCs of this sort in order to find materialthat leads you into the hot incidents:“Tell me some things about yourself you don’t like”“Tell me some things about yourself you like best”(Note: these are two separate TWCs, not alternate commands.)Similar TWCs can be designed which follow the basic principle of taking person-ality traits and using them to lead you to hot terminals who might be the basic valence massat the other end of the “dumbbell”.END PHENOMENAThe rundown has two major types of cognitions, and both of them should occurbefore the rundown is declared complete.The first is a realization that the person is himself. Some statement that adds up to“I’m me!” will occur if the rundown is done correctly.The second will be an awareness that the person is here, aware of the presentenvironment, or “I’m here!”. These two cognitions are natural results of undoing thedumbbell phenomena.NOTES ON PROGRAMMINGAs this is a major action you should have the person’s ruds in and he should not bein the middle of other major actions.Note, too, that in order to apply these principles intelligently you have to understandthe anatomy of valence-counter valence or the problem aspect to suppression.A long series of problems with mother may be enough to restimulate a valence shifteven though mother did not beat the pc or knock him/her unconscious. But the constantlocks can restimulate earlier engramic masses which will contain overwhelm.These get picked up and run on the earlier similar chains that come up in the actionsdescribed.When the hot incidents which keep the pc pinned into the dumbbell are lifted anderased, the dumbbell will snap around and the pc will be looking at the world through his/her own viewpoint again for a change. This brings about the “I’m here” “I’m me”cognitions which signal the end phenomena of the rundown having occurred.There has been no pilot for administering this rundown on Clears or above as far asI know. The rundown was researched by LRH in 1975, prior to “Dianetics Forbidden onClears and OTs”. It is paralleled in some respects by Step 15 of the NED for OTs RD.It has had spectacular results on many cases. There have been some cases it did nothave spectacular results on, for various reasons. Usually these were cases being auditedafter Clear in error, or cases with other by-passed charge not repaired such as list errorsor PT overts or other our ruds, or were XDN type cases and were not effect as much asthey were contra-survival cause. The NVRD might not resolve this aspect of case (CSSeries 22 cases)."},{"pageNumber":587,"pageContent":"587"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"588"},{"pageNumber":589,"pageContent":"589BRIGHT THINK R/D"},{"pageNumber":590,"pageContent":"590"},{"pageNumber":591,"pageContent":"591HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO BULLETIN OF 6 DECEMBER 1978C/SesTech/QualClass IV GradAuditorsREVIVIFICATIONRevivification is the bringing back to life of an engram in which a preclear is stuck.The engram or some portion thereof is being acted out in present time by the preclear. Itis called a revivification because the engram is suddenly more real to the preclear thanpresent time has ever been. He relives that moment briefly.

Return is the method of retaining the body and theawareness of the subject in present time while he is told to go back to a certain incident.Revivification is the reliving of an incident or a portion of it as if it were happening now.This phenomenon can occur in a pc during the End of Endless Int Repair Rundown.(Ref: HCOB 24 Sep 78R, Iss 1. Int RD Series 4R. THE END OF ENDLESS INT REPAIRRUNDOWN.)The pc, being run on Recalls on Int, will often begin by recalling locks but these can triggerinto full play an engram in which he may be stuck and the pc may go into a revivificationof it. He will actually be answering and acting from the point or points, down the trackwhere he has been stuck.Should this happen the auditor simply continues to run the process and get the pcthrough it. As the pc revivifies he blows through these stuck points on his track and comesout of them, newly, and is now truly in present time.As revivification is apt to occur on the End of Endless Int Repair, auditors mustunderstand and be able to recognize the phenomena and handle it routinely with excellentTRs when it does.L.

You can have a guy totally reviv’d in time, he’s stuck downthe track in an incident which is PT for him. Anything which he views, is viewed fromthis point in time. It is when he is.A being can also be in a reviv in place or location. That is where he is. Everythinghe views is viewed from that location, that viewpoint in space. They’re “buttered all overthe universe”. A BT can think of himself as up there, looking down at himself. A totallywrong viewpoint. He’s in a reviv and everything he does is from a stuck viewpoint, so he’soperating with a stuck spacial point of view. Say the guy is reviv’d in Flanders, everythinghe does is from the viewpoint in Flanders - even tries to look at himself (now) fromFlanders. He’s operating in PT from some place down the track.THOUGHT DISASSOCIATIONThought disassociation follows a point of view pattern. to you from an altered pointof view, so you get disassociated thought. Say he’s in a reviv of location, in a radar stationin space. You ask him “Where are the books?” - he looks at a radar screen and says“They’re going away”.I know a case who had an accident. She thought she left the body and went to abetween lives implant and returned to the body. But there has been no between livesimplant in that place for eons! What happened is, she was reviv’d in a between livesimplant. She had the accident and went exterior, she thought she went to this between livesimplant because that’s the location she was reviv’d in.This is a matter of old fixed viewpoints in spacial locations. You can often cure acase with the process “Where would you be safe?” He might go through a heavy reviv onthe process and he might “do a bunk” - going back to his last point of view, locationThat’swhy D/L works.

He’sso far south he can’t confront anything that’s in front of him. You tell him to look at thewindow, he sort of reaches out to the window with a beam or something, makes a pictureof it, and pulls the picture back up to him, looks at it and tells you the window has barson it.

A percentage which was only one or two has jumpedup to eighty or ninety.This factor is visible in a decline in the ability to tell differences, similarities andidentities.In trying to train a person or get him to live a more survival type life, theestablishment officer is encountering this factor.There is a similar instance of this when drugs first moved into the scene. Before themid-60’s drugs were never much of a factor in processing and such cases were consideredrare and then only as a result of medical treatments.Suddenly I has on my hands a case that did not behave like a case. The TA went outthe roof unexpectedly, with no apparent cause and the case wouldn’t EP. I went into a sortout on what was different on this case from other cases. It was marijuana. Once we hadrun out the marijuana the case behaved like a normal case. I was suddenly looking at arising percentage of such cases, which to date, through the kindness of psychology andpsychiatry, had risen to a majority of cases in society.So here we go again. Some new factor apparently has entered into the society andhas risen in a percent which is so high that it will get in the road of anyone trying to getthe show on the road.The factor can be called “Disassociation”.We have here a marvellous new process — The Bright Think Rundown. Powerfullysimple, it requires and auditor who is well-steeled against the temptation to Q and A andwho is able to run a process through whatever it turns on.It was originally designed as a remedy for Theetie Weetie cases, but has provenenormously successful as well with cases who disassociate."},{"pageNumber":595,"pageContent":"595This is the person who associates not A and B, but A and O. Not apples and bananasbut apples and typewriters. You make a statement and he bends it over to something thathas nothing to do with the price of fish.He is very hard to direct because alter-is enters into it. In fact, an alter-is could bea manifestation of being disassociated.Things which are different, he conceives to be identical. Things which are similarhe conceives to be widely different. Things which are identical he conceives to be onlysimilar.This case will mess up or complicate just about any order or communication bybringing in carloads of data which have absolutley nothing to do with it. This is becausehe mis-identifies and cannot evaluate differences in time, location, form, composition, orimportance. He is lost in his own figure-figure and facsimilies, sometimes universesaway.The new discovery is that he is back on the time track in locations very remote fromwhere he is. It is not that he is stuck on the track where he is, but is stuck on the trackelsewhere, often eons ago.This is the reason Date/Locate works. It has to be in that order. You have to dateit and then locate it because the location is never in now.The auditor who runs it and the C/S who C/S’s it have to have a full command ofthe subject of “revivication”.Revivication is the bringing back to life of a engram in which a preclear is stuck. Theengram or some portion thereof is being acted out in present time by the preclear. It iscalled revivication because the engram is suddenly more real to the preclear than presenttime has ever been. He re-live that moment briefly. He does not merely recall orremember it.This means that the person moves into a back point of time totally. He gives certainmanifestations when he does this, these can be various. They always are visible to theauditor. The trick in processing is to keep running the process until the pc comes out ofit just as though nothing had happened.As the process is run expect the pc to answer from points down the track where hehas been stuck. These arethe points he operates from while apparently in PT. Expectengrams to appear, with revivication occuring as they are contacted and blown. As thepc re-lives these incidents, he will come out of them, newly, and this time truly in presenttime. And with a new viewpoint.Anaten, somatics, abrupt shifts of tone level, heat, agitated physical motion are allquite likely to occur as these points are run off, as the pc is actually revivifying at eachheavy point. You just keep running the process with good TRs and metering.The auditor must ensure the pc is fully sessionable before starting the Rundown, andonce started, must get the pc through the phenomena which occur as the pc revivifies andblows through the stuck points on his track. The pc’s answers will signify to the auditorprecisely what is occurring. It is vital not to Q and A with these “symptoms” as they comeup."},{"pageNumber":596,"pageContent":"596THE C/SHere is your C/S for the Bright Think Rundown.Run:“Where would you be safe?”Repetitively to F/N, Cog, VGIs (and pc in PT of course).The end phenomena of the process is a realisation by the pc that he’s really in presenttime. This EP is normally expressed with some variation of the statement “I’m Here!”This EP must not be caoxed by the auditor asking “Are you here yet?” and the pc mustnot be fed the cognition.As the process is run the pc will spot places that are nearby and then places that arefar away. The spots he’d spot are near, then far, then near, then far, sometimes a few nearand then a few far and then a few near. If the pc does not do this then you know he is notdoing the process.You will find up to 20% of your pc’s give simply glib answers and experience nochange. This pc is answering the question in some particular and outrageous way. If yougive him a D of P Interview on exacly how he was answering the question, you will findhe was using some oddball system disassociated from the process. (The fourth AmericanACC tapes discuss this.) The way to handle this pc is objectives as he is too far out of itto handle a concept and is basically operating off a system. Before you can spot placesin the universe you have to have a universe, right?The main errors an auditor can make are a failure to carry on the process whensomething peculiar happens and failure to notice a true EP has been reached.On the failed case (the 20% noted above), when objectives have honestly beencompleted, you can then run the process with great benefits, but be sure the pc is up toanswering the question.You will get some remarkable changes. Some major wins.L. RON HUBBARDFOUNDERLRH:dm.kjmCopyright © 1978By L.

Before one can know he isbelow confusion, he usually has to realize that he is in a condition of no-condition.Power is the ability to hold a position in space. The first action of creating space isto assume a point from which to view that space. When a viewpoint has been knockedaround down through the time track by forces he believes have affected him, he tends tolose his ability to maintain a position in space.A being can assume the viewpoint of the first dynamic and attempt to take on all theother dynamics, which eventually overwhelms him. To get a being rehabilitated into theposition of being able to operate at cause on all the dynamics, it is first necessary to gethim into a condition of being.Therefore, the first action one takes in running the Super Power processes is to havethe person find a viewpoint.The first command is:“Find a viewpoint.”This is run to F/N Cog VGIs.Then one runs the other flows:“Find another’s viewpoint,”“Find a viewpoint that others are creating for others.”“Find a viewpoint that you have created for yourself.”A being can be so socked into the MEST universe that viewpoints have become solidobjects. Viewpoints are points from which one views universes. Solid objects are madeup of matter, energy, space and time. Space is created by a viewpoint; a viewpoint canthink the opposite.Many times you will find a person who is inverted on the dynamics to such an extentthat he feel that MEST has created him rather than the other way around.This process will get the being into a position of being able to handle the conditionbelow confusion and set him up for the next steps of the Super Power Rundown."},{"pageNumber":603,"pageContent":"6038TH DYNAMIC PROCESSESSuper Power Rundown Series 2This is an unlimited process. Usually you will find the person to be inverted on thedynamics. God is not an object. When one labels god with an identity one immediatelydegrades the 8th dynamic into MEST terms. The 8th dynamic cannot be defined in termsof MEST. It can only be defined in terms of infinity which the number 8 symbolizes.When running this process start with the 8th dynamic. Then run through the first upthrough the seventh and then stop. The purpose is to get the person to assume variousviewpoints on all the dynamics at one level and then bring the person back to the 8thdynamic viewpoint.This process puts responsibility back into the person and sets him up for repair ofall earlier actions which brought about a dwindling spiral away from the 8th dynamicviewpoint.This process is run even if the person goes exterior or has a big win. The only timeyou would end off the process is on a floating tone arm because obviously you cannot getany more reads on the meter.While running this process if any upsets, overts, missed withholds occur one simplycleans them up. On running OTs one deals with any body thetans, clusters, entities andso forth as they show up. Remember to audit the person in front of you which means ifsomeone else shows up you must audit them out, set them free before you can set theperson in front of you, in the body, free.Here are the commands in order:1.Assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.2.Get the idea of another assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.3.Get the idea of others assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.4.Get the idea of you causing yourself to assume the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.5.Get the idea of your second dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.6.Get the idea of another second dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.7.Get the idea of other second dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.8.Get the idea of you causing all second dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.9.Get the idea of your third dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.10.Get the idea of another third dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.11.Get the idea of other third dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic."},{"pageNumber":604,"pageContent":"60412.Get the idea of you causing all third dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.13.Get the idea of your fourth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.14.Get the idea of another fourth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.15.Get the idea of other fourth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.16.Get the idea of you causing all fourth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.17.Get the idea of your fifth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.18.Get the idea of another fifth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.19.Get the idea of other fifth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.20.Get the idea of you causing all fifth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.21.Get the idea of your sixth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.22.Get the idea of another sixth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.23.Get the idea of other sixth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.24.Get the idea of you causing all sixth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.25.Get the idea of your seventh dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.26.Get the idea of another seventh dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.27.Get the idea of other seventh dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.28.Get the idea of you causing all seventh dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.29.Get the idea of your eighth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.30.Get the idea of another eighth dynamic assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.31.Get the idea of other eighth dynamics assuming the viewpoint of the 8th dynamic.32.Get the idea of you causing all eighth dynamics to assume the viewpoint of the 8thdynamic.At this point the person should be in very good shape, enough so that his earlierinjustices on the track can be easily accessible from the various viewpoints of thedynamics.The next step is to do the Ethics Repair List as per Super Power Rundown Series 3."},{"pageNumber":605,"pageContent":"605ETHICS REPAIR LISTSuper Power Rundown Series 3The purpose of the Ethics Repair List is to return full power to a being by proofinghim up against injustices, counter postulates, failed purposes, counter purposes and evilintentions across the dynamics.These questions are asked in an unlimited way.

All prior steps on the Super Power Rundown have beendesigned to get a person into a state wherein he is set up to regain his ability to handleinfinite power. These processes are run just like any other process with full F/N, Cog VGIsas the EP. If the person goes exterior continue to run the processes. If there is a dial wideF/N continue to run the process. The only time you would end off the process or the sessionis if the person has a persistent floating TA.At some point during the running of this series of processes the person will reacha state wherein they are speechless. They will laugh with wild abandon. Their TA will befloating! They will probably also be exterior and will be unable to communicate in wordswhat they are experiencing. This is the end result of the Super Power Rundown. It is rarefor this to occur prior to the running of the last flow of this series of processes, but if itoccurs then acknowledge the win.One thing the auditor must not do is interrupt the person while in the middle of thismajor win or during the laughter. Otherwise it will invalidate the win. The auditor simplymaintains his TRs and lets the person have his win. Do not end the session until thelaughter stops as this will also tend to invalidate the person and his win.The laughter can go on for some time. Perhaps up to an hour. Be sure and just be therewith the person during this win and not end the session until the laughter has subsided.The following is the last series of processes one runs on the Super Power Rundown:1.Get the idea that you have infinite power.2.Get the idea that another has infinite power.3.Get the idea that others have infinite power.4.Get the idea that you can cause yourself to have infinite power.5.Get the idea that you have been given infinite power.6.Get the idea that another has been given infinite power.7.Get the idea that others have been given infinite power.8.Get the idea that you have caused yourself to be given infinite power.9.Get the idea that you can give another infinite power.10.Get the idea that another can give you infinite power.11.Get the idea that others can give others infinite power.12.Get the idea that you can cause yourself infinite power.13.Get the idea that you are infinite.14.Get the idea that another is infinite.15.Get the idea that others are infinite.16.Get the idea that you can cause yourself to be infinity.Make sure to run only the reading process and check for interest.
