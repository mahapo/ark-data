RON HUBBARD"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2PREFACEBYGERRY ARMSTRONG This is my contribution to the celebrations and protests on the occasion of the birthday of L. Ron Hubbardin 2000.Not all that long ago, someone sent me a copy of the set of writings which follow, written by L. Ron Hub-bard in or about 1947. The original of these writings was in Hubbard's personal archive which I assembledand worked with in 1980 and 1981. I provided the writings to Omar Garrison, a wog ® writer with whom$cientology had contracted to write Hubbard's \"authorized biography.\" In 1984 I read portions of theminto the record at my trial in $cientology v. Armstrong, Los Angeles Superior Court, Case No. C 420153.The trial resulted in the widely cited decision by Judge Paul G. Breckenridge, Jr. wherein he describedHubbard as a \"pathological liar.\" (URL?)Omar first called these writings Hubbard's \"Affirmations.\" Later, after it dawned on him that Hubbard wasa stupendous liar, Omar said he was correcting himself, and thereafter called the writings the\"Admissions.\" I believe that Omar was right, and that these writings are \"Affirmations,\" but more impor-tantly, \"Admissions.\"I will not now provide anything really of my own analysis or conclusions about Hubbard's Admissions,because I want every $cientologist or wog ® who reads them to be free, or with negligible influence, tothink about them for himself. I will comment below, for legal reasons, on *why* I am posting the Admis-sions. I have my own experiences, naturally, with these writings, I have drawn my own conclusions aboutthem, and I expect I will participate in a discussion or two they may generate.I don't know who in this recent period sent me the copy from which I typed that follows. In any event Iwould not divulge the identity of the person because of the clear and senseless threat of attack from thepeople who now run $cientology. It is sufficient for legal purposes to state that the copy I received was notmade by me. By the time the Admissions are posted to the Internet, I will have, pursuant to the wishes ofthe person who made it, destroyed the copy Ireceived.I will also immediately wipe the Admissions from my hard drive. Thus the people who run $cientologywill have less reason or justification to raid me or break into my house or computer than they have to raidor break into the house or computer of a million other people.The Admissions I received are not complete. Perhaps when the kind person who sent me the copy seesthey have been posted he will send the rest of the writings. My recollection is that the remainder of theAdmissions do not diverge from the substance, direction or tone of what I'm posting here. Included in theremainder is, I think, a deeper delve into Hubbard's sexual anxieties or aberrations, following the samevein he mined in the part I received. What I received, for example, doesn't include Hubbard's startlingadmission, \"It doesn't give me displeasure to hear of a virgin being raped. The lot of women is to be forni-cated.\"I am posting the Admissions for all of the reasons stated in my declaration of January 26, 1997, specifi-cally in paragraphs 57 - 65, which I recently posted to a.r.s.:From: (Gerry Armstrong)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3Newsgroups: alt.religion.scientologySubject: Making Light of Black PR, Part 2, January 26, 1997 Armstrong Declaration for RTC v.

I stated that publication of$cientology's \"secret scriptures\" is in my opinion Constitutionally protected religious expression.Hubbard's Admissions are quite obviously a part of $cientology's \"scriptures. On the holiness scale ®, theyare holier than the holiest of the Advanced Technology scriptures, because the people who run $cientologywon't show them to $cientologists even if they have a half million dollars to pay and agree to the organi-zation implant. Although the Admissions are the holiest of $cientology's scriptures, the Miscavige regimewithholds them for the identical commercial, secular, base and criminal reasons they withhold the \"OT\"\"Levels,\" the \"NOT$,\" and the whereabouts of Xenu's mountain cave.$cientology has set no prerequisites or punishments that I'm aware of for $cientologists reading Hubbard'sAdmissions, and for that at least I'm grateful. I believe that the Admissions should be read by every$cientologist at whatever point they find themselves on the bridge. $cientologists won't get pneumonia.They might have some good cognitions. ® They might become free.The Admissions were very important to me in my getting free of the web of lies Hubbard and $cientologyhad spun, and getting free of their domination and suppression. I am posting these writings now with theprayer that they help to free other $cientologists from Hubbard's and Miscavige's lies, domination andsuppression. If Hubbard has been humbled and regained his willfully lost humanity, I know he too wouldwant every $cientologist to read all his Admissions.Obviously I don't have any desire to profit monetarily by posting Hubbard's unpublished Admissions. Mydesire is that these writings help everyone, $cientologist and wog ®, to make informed and better choicesabout L. Ron Hubbard and $cientology. I was not freed by being a $cientologist, doing $cientology, andhaving all the experiences, cognitions and trappings of $cientology. I was freed by reading what$cientologists don't get to read, by being what no $cientologist would be, a wog ®, by doing what no$cientologist would do, and having my own experiences, cognitions and stuff. I share Hubbard's Admis-sions with everyone because God Who created knowledge does not want anyone to be kept ignorant.I stated in the Jan 26, 1997 declaration that the people $cientology identified as violating the organiza-tion's copyrights and sued - Grady Ward, Lawrence Wollersheim, Keith Henson, Dennis Erlich, ArnieLerma, Bob Penny -- were in general agreement that $cientology is not a sincere, and hence real, religion,but is a criminal cult engaged in harmful practices. I also stated that if these people are correct in theirassessment, and if they did expose or publish $cientology's \"secret\" documents, they were and are com-pletely justified in having done so.Repeating what I wrote in the Jan 26, 1997 declaration, \"In my opinion this kind of expression is an ex-pected, logical response to Scientology's efforts to corrupt the meaning of religion in order to \"sanctify\" itsantisocial and dangerous mind set and criminal activities. It is expression which cannot legally be prohib-ited or punished by judicial process.\" I agree completely that $cientology, that is, $cientology as directedby David Miscavige and his regime, is not a sincere, real religion, but a criminal cult engaged in harmful"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"4practices.I could, quite clearly, have posted the Admissions anonymously. I gave it serious consideration, becausewhile I believe these writings, for the peace and health and spirit of so many people, should be posted im-mediately, I wanted to do what be effective and not the stupid end of martyrdom. I decided against ano-nymity, however, for a number of reasons. I believe that by U.$., Canadian and international law, andcommon sense, I am permitted to publish these writings openly. I believe that by common decency, byhuman and civil rights codes, by being a Prophet to $cientologists (Pt$), and by God Himself, I am urged,in fact directed, to post these writings and post them openly.I am also posting the Admissions openly to confirm their authenticity. The copy I received was not clearin places, and it is now gone. All words, spellings, punctuation and notations are Hubbard's, except forbrackets [ ] which are mine. I pray that DM makes the complete original of the Admissions available for$cientologists around the world. Indeed I pray that he reveals every hidden piece of Hubbard's writings,and yes, even his own secret documents, to all $cientologists and interested wogs ®. Robert VaughnYoung and Stacy Brooks at least have read the Admissions and will be able to confirm that what followshere is, within reasonable parameters, authentic. I was very careful, but if there are any errors at all inwhat I have posted of the Hubbard Admissions, I urge DM to have them corrected.Posting the Admissions, I believe, lessens the threat of harm or murder to silence me, but it ups the re-venge factor ®. The person who sent me the copy emphatically doesn't want any trouble. Good Lord, Idon't want any trouble, and I'm the guy who typed this copy and will now post it using my own name toa.r.s. The person who sent the copy certainly knew that I would recognize the writings and I'd like tothink wanted me to do with them what I've done and what the person was in no position to do. I have notshown what I'm posting to anyone, but I will now email it to certain people when I post it.I am aware that DM will almost certainly attack me. To justify his and $cientology's continuing attack, asHubbard did for his continuing attacks while he lived, they made attack their organizational policy ofchoice, or scripture of choice I suppose I should say. Nevertheless, perhaps this is a good time for Mis-cavige to learn that non-attack is the best policy.I really think the $cientologists would be silly to sue me. Then again I've thought they're silly for yearsand years and that hasn't deterred them. But perhaps in this instance they can learn to not do another sillything. I'm giving $cientology and $cientologists another golden opportunity to stop being silly. It's Godactually Who gives everyone opportunities to stop being silly. I'm but a simple messenger, with staggeringinabilities, and at times admittedly silly. Miscavige's $cientology is willfully silly. Suppression is no acci-dent, it is willful. I am but a prophet who brings $cientologists opportunities to be healed of their willful-ness, silliness and suppression.I am aware that the posting of the Admissions makes a godsent legal test case. If I am guided by God,what I have done not being unsafe or immoral, my post is protected expression because it cannot be de-nied. Without including God, it is clear that $cientology, $cientologists and their agents (for there arewogs ® who are $cientology's agents) are themselves responsible for my actions. What they have done tosilence me, to 8-C my body from place to place, to invalidate me, to black PR me, to threaten me, to de-stroy me, has either been a source of my state of mind, and hence my actions, or God has. (I think it canbe agreed that the mind directs actions, rather than actions directing the mind.)If God is directing my actions, how could I do anything else? If DM and his $cientology organization haveaffected my mind, they bear responsibility for the act about which they might complain. In truth boththings are true. God is in control, and DM and $cientology have unclean hands. It is observable through-out history that God sends prophets, and even the unprofitable, to deal with tyrants and regimes whosehands are unclean.A case can be made that my posting Hubbard's Admissions is a fair and appropriate response to DM's dis-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5semination and Internet posting of my writing known as the \"pig dream.\" Obviously I held the copyrightto that unpublished work. The pig dream was a glimpse in an extremely literary form into the mind ofGerry Armstrong. The Admissions are a glimpse in a different literary form into the mind of L. Ron Hub-bard.I certainly don't argue that Hubbard's Admissions are no more important or vital than my pig dream.There is, after all, nobody paying huge sums of money and spending their lives working for Armstrongol-ogy. On the other hand, Hubbard's dead. DM had his agents post the pig dream to hurt me. I'm postingHubbard's Admissions to set $cientologists free. I'll copyright my portion of this post, and hereby give mypermission for it to be copied and distributed.For fair use purposes, the context for the post containing the Admissions is the global controversy aboutHubbard, about $cientology's antecedents, about Hubbard's psyche, his honesty or dishonesty, his mentaltechnology, \"Excalibur,\" his promises, his aims, his history, his theology, his hypnotism, his navy record,his non-navy record, and other clearly controversial Hubbard-connected conundrums. The context is thecontroversy we see every day on a.r.s. and in media around the world.The period when Hubbard made these Admissions involved John W. Parsons, Sara Northrup, his family,magick, his \"development\" of \"Dianetics\" leading to the publication of the book that would make himfamous and lead on to $cientology. Funnily, Hubbard and $cientology claim that he was a \"Special Offi-cer\" for the LAPD in this period and that he was working for the U$ Navy to break up the Parsons \"blackmagic ring.\" There is a VA record showing that around the time of the Admissions Hubbard sought psy-chiatric help.Just one last thought, which I'll repeat from my Jan 26, 1997 declaration, and which I pray that DM andhis $cientologists take to heart. Although man may attempt to keep God out of his other realms, he surelycannot keep God out of religion, because in this world it is His Realm. That's sort of the message everyprophet brings.I hope Hubbard's Admissions are a blessing and a help to all.© 2000 Gerry Armstrong"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6ERROR! NO TABLE OF CONTENTS ENTRIES FOUND."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7COURSE IThe purpose of this experiment is to re-establish the ambition, willpower, desire to sur-vive, the talent and confidence of myself.To accomplish the above the following fears must be removed Fear that I have writtenmyself out by writing junk. I built certain psychoses in myself while living with my former wife asa means to protect my writing. I affirmed that my writing was hard work and took much labor.This was a lie. I was always anxious about people's opinion of me and was afraid I would borethem. This injected anxiety and careless speed into my work. I must be convinced that I canwrite skillfully and well, that I have no phobias about writing and no fears of it. People criticizedmy work bitterly at times. I must be convinced that such people were fools. I must be convincedthat I can write far better than ever before, that a million people at least would be happy to seemy stories. I must be convinced that I have succeeded in writing and with ease will regain mypopularity, which actually was not small. I must also be convinced that I dictatestories to a dictaphone with ease.I must be told that my memory is strong and reliable, that I can remember all I have ever read orstudied, that no illness or medicine has affected mind or memory.(b) My service record was not too glorious. I must be convinced that I suffer no reaction from anyminor disciplinary action, that all such were minor. My service was honorable, my initiative andability high. I have nothing to fear from friends about my service. I can forget such things asAdmiral Braystead. Such people are unworthy of my notice.(c) I can have no doubts of my psychic powers. My magical ability is high and clear. I earned mytitles and command.(d) Any distaste I may have for Jack Parsons originated in a psychic experiment. Such distaste isfoolish. He is my friend and comrade-in-arms.(e) Sexual feeling has been depressed by several things amounting to a major impasse. To cureulcers of the stomach I was given testosterone and stilbesterol. These reduced my libido tonothing. While taking these drugs I fell in love with Sara. She can be most exciting sexually tome. Because of drugs as above and a hangover from my ex-wife Polly, I sometimes am unex-cited by anything sexual. This depresses me.My wife left me while I was in a hospital with ulcers. Polly was quite cruel. She was never awoman for me. She was under-sexed and had bad sexual habits such as self-laceration done inprivate. She was no mate for me and yet I retained much affection for her. It was a terrible blowwhen she left me for I was ill and without prospects. I know, bythis, she actually wanted no more than my ability to support her. This has had an effect of impo-tency upon me, has badly reduced my ego.Polly was very bad for me sexually. Because of her coldness physically, the falsity of her preten-sions, I believed myself a near eunuch between 1933 and 1936 or ? when I found I was attractiveto other women. I had many affairs. But my failure to please Polly made me always pay so muchattention to my momentary mate that I derived small pleasure myself. This was an anxiety neu-rosis which cut down my natural powers.In 1938-39 I met a girl in New York, Helen, who pleased me very much physically. I loved herand she me. The affair would have lasted had not Polly found out. Polly made things so miser-able that I finally detested her and became detested by Helen, who two-timed me on my return toNew York in 1941. This also reduced my libido. I have hadHelen since but no longer want her. She does not excite me and I do not love her."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8In 1942 - December 17th or thereabouts - while training in Miami, Florida, I met a girl namedGinger who excited me. She was a very loose person but pretended a great love for me. Fromher I received an infection of gonnohorea (sp?). I was terrified by it, the consequences of beingdiscovered by my wife, the navy, my friends. I went to a private doctor who treated me withsulfa-thiazole and so forth. I thought I was cured but on a plane headed to Portland, Ore. I foundIwas not. I took to dosing myself with sulfa in such quantities that I was afraid I had affected mybrain. My wife came to Portland. I took what precautions I could. I think actually that the diseasewas utterly cured very early. This fear further depressed my libido. My wife disliked the act any-way, I believe, even after she had a hysterectomy in 1938. (She was always terrified of childbirthbut conceived despite all precautions seven times in five years resulting in five abortions and twochildren. I am quite fond of my children but my wife always tried to convince me that I hatedthem.)I carried this fear of the disease to sea with me. I was reprimanded in San Diego in mid-43 forfiring on the Mexican coast and was removed from command of my ship. This on top of havingsunk two Jap subs without credit, the way my crew lied for me at the Court of Inquiry, the insultsof the High Command, all combined to put me in the hospital with ulcers.I returned to sea as navigator of a large ship and was subsequently selected for the MilitaryGovernment School at Princeton whither I went in 1944-45 for three months. During my Prince-ton sojourn I was very tired and harrassed (sp?) and spent week-ends with a writer friend inPhiladelphia. He almost forced me to sleep with his wife. Meanwhile I had a affair with a womannamed Ferne. Somehow, perhaps because I had constantly wet feet and no sleep at Princeton, Icontracted a staphloceus infection. I mistook it for gonnhorea and until I arrived at Monterey,believed my old illness had returned. I consulted a doctor there who reassured me. This affairagain depressed my libido. The staphloceus infection has not entirely vanished, appearing asrheumatism which only small doses of stilbestrol willremove. The hormone further reduces my libido and I am nearly impotent.Sara, my sweetheart, is young, beautiful, desirable. We are very gay companions. I please herphysically until she weeps about any separation. I want her always. But I am 13 years older thanshe. She is heavily sexed. My libido is so low I hardly admire her naked.I mean to be constant to her. I love her very much. But to live with her I must regain my sexualpowers, my stimulus.I must cease to take hormones. I must rebuild my feeling of excitement about things sexual.I have a very bad masturbatory history. I was taught when I was 11 and, despite guilt, fear ofinsanity, etc. etc. I persisted. At a physical examination at a Y when I was about 13, the exam-iner and the people with him called me out of the line because my testicles hung low and cau-tioned me about what would happen if I kept on masturbating. This \"discovery\" was a bad shockto me.I had to be so silent about it that now when a bedspring squeaks I lose all libido. I eventuallyfound out I would not be insane, or injure myself but the scars remain.Polly pretended a hollow passion which disgusted me. But I am lingeringly fond of her even so. Iam also nostalgic about Helen.By eliminating certain fears by hypnosis, curing my rheumatism and laying off hormones, I hopeto restore my former libido. I must! By hypnosis I must be convinced as follows:(a) I can write. I need not think commercially about writing."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9(b) My mind is still brilliant. My memory unaffected by drugs or experience.(c) That masturbation was no sin or crime and did not injure me. That no sexual practice hasever dulled me.(d) That things sexual thrill me. That I am now returned to the same feelings I had at 16 aboutsex where excitement is concerned. That naked women and pornography excite me greatly. ThatSara excites me greatly and gives me much pleasure.(e) That I bear no physical aftermath of disease.(f) That I do not need to have ulcers any more.(g) That my eyes (which I used as an excuse to get out of school) are perfect and do not pain meever.(h) That I love in Sara everything I loved in Polly or Helen and that such love is now transferredto Sara.(i) That I am fortunate in losing Polly and my parents, for they never meant well by me.(j) That I never need be jealous of Sara's past. That she loves me and is utterly faithful. That shethrills me more than Helen ever did.(k) That life is beautiful to me. That I want to live. That things taste and smell and look and feelwonderful to me.(l) That I wrote a great book in The One Command and that it removed all my fears even untilnow, except that my chapters on the mind do not affect my own mind. That I have will power andgreat mental control. That I need not associate anything unless I wish.(m) That I have only friendship for Jack Parsons.(n) That I feel no wish for vengeance toward anyone.
