Ron Hubbard was one of the first students of nuclear physics in the United States.In 1932 he believed that Life and its behavior obeyed natural laws of the same orderas electrons and other particles of motion. He began a study and search which led himthrough many fields of science and across many continents.In 1948 he published the “Original Thesis” on his findings for the medical andpsychiatric professions. In 1950 he permitted a popular work to be published and wasconsiderably astonished that it became a best seller quickly. Since 1950 he has workedconstantly upon the original project of discovering and conduiting the source of Life Energyand with this work announces the attainment of that fact.This volume is a detail of the discovery, its formula, and the factors necessary tobring the fact into application.For three years, scientific controversy has raged around L. Ron Hubbard’s work. Themost degrading attacks and flowery praise have greeted his activities from every quarter, layand scientific. He has given the acceptance of his work and the attacks and praise alike littlethought but has continued to follow his route of discovery. His issuance of these findingscaps a scientifically stormy career. It is doubtful if the storm will grow calmer in the face ofthe calm announcement that one has discovered and isolated life and provided the techniquesfor its use and conducting.Careful testing by many persons already has assured the truth and usefulness of thiswork. It is not experimental but has been applied scientifically and confirmed in manyquarters.2"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"FOREWORDWHAT IS SCIENTOLOGY?“Scientology” is a new word which names a new science. It is formed from the Latinword, “scio”, which means KNOW, or DISTINGUISH, being related to the word “scindo”,which means CLEAVE. (Thus, the idea of differentiation is strongly implied.) It is formedfrom the Greek word “logos”, which means THE WORD, or OUTWARD FORM BYWHICH THE INWARD THOUGHT IS EXPRESSED AND MADE KNOWN: also, THEINWARD THOUGHT or REASON ITSELF. Thus, SCIENTOLOGY means KNOWINGABOUT KNOWING, or SCIENCE OF KNOWLEDGE.A science is not merely a collection of facts, neatly arranged. An essential of ascience is that observations give rise to theories which, in turn, predict new observations.When the new observations are made, they, in turn, give rise to better theories, which predictfurther observations.A science grows. Its most important growth is not in numbers of facts but in theclarity and prediction-value of its theories. Many fields which call themselves sciencessubstitute fact collecting for theorizing, others substitute theorizing for observation. Withoutboth, there is no science.The “exact” sciences contradict each other daily. This is not because theirobservations are wrong, but because they cling to old theories that conflict instead of findingthe newer, simpler theories.Scientology has introduced new simplicities of theory into the field of human thoughtand has brought the study of human thought up to a level at which it begins to embrace allthought and all life, not only of man, but of all organisms.Scientology is not a therapy for the sick, although from Scientology such a therapymay be derived.Thought is the subject matter of Scientology. It is considered as a kind of “energy”which is NOT PART of the physical universe. It controls energy, but it has no wave length. Ituses matter, but it has no mass. It is found in space, but it has no position. It records time, butit is not subject to time. The Greek word (and letter), THETA, is used as a symbol forthought as an “energy”.Technique 8-80 is a specialized form of Scientology. It is, specifically, the electronicsof human thought and beingness. It is basic in answering the riddles of life and its goals inthe MEST universe.The goal is Survival. The means to survival for life is the handling and use of energy.The “8-8” stands for “Infinity-Infinity” upright, the “O” represents the static, theta.A new student of this subject is referred to the logics and Axioms and the basicprocesses of thought, counterthought, emotion, counter-emotion, effort, counter-effort,attention units, and counter-units.Technique 8-80 appends but does not amend or replace any earlier material. It doesthe work of Scientology more quickly if used against an understanding of the basic subject.3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SCIENTOLOGY: 8-804"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEThis book is started with the Auditor’s Code, for any experimentation with thesephenomena must be done in full awareness of this code. An “auditor” is one who “listens andcomputes”, and is a practitioner in Scientology. Experiments done without strict adherence tothis code will fail.The auditor who does not know, or practice at all times, the Auditor’s Code, isignoring one of the basic tenets of Scientology. This code has been called “the code of howto be civilized”. Much more important than knowing mechanical techniques is knowing wellthe attitude one should have toward a preclear. This is not for courtesy but for efficiency. Nopreclear will respond to an auditor who does not adhere to the Auditor’s Code.Breaking the Auditor’s Code, at first glance, may not appear to be a very great sin.But an auditor has undertaken to aid a fellow man, and his dedication to that purpose must besincere to the point of sacredness.The following points, taken from Science of Survival, should be as much a part of anauditor’s thinking and attitude as his knowledge of reading and speaking. Unless one feels hecan adhere to this code, he should not, under any circumstances, attempt to audit anyone:The auditor conducts himself in such a way as to maintain optimum Affinity,Communications, and Agreement with the preclear.The auditor is trustworthy. He understands that the preclear has given into theauditor’s trust his hope for higher sanity and happiness, and that the trust is sacred and neverto be betrayed.The auditor is courteous. He respects the preclear as a human being. He respects theself-determinism of the preclear. He respects his own position as an auditor. He expressesthis respect in courteous conduct.The auditor is courageous. He never falls back from his duty to a case. He never failsto use the optimum procedure regardless of any alarming conduct on the part of the preclear.The auditor never evaluates the case for the preclear. He abstains from this, knowingthat to compute for the preclear is to inhibit the preclear’s own computation. He knows thatto refresh the preclear’s mind as to what went before is to cause the preclear to dependheavily upon the auditor and so to undermine the self-determinism of the preclear.The auditor never invalidates any of the data or the personality of the preclear. Heknows that in doing so he would seriously enturbulate the preclear. He refrains from criticismand invalidation no matter how much his own sense of reality is twisted or shaken by thepreclear’s incidents (past experiences) or utterances.The auditor uses only techniques designed to restore the self-determinism of thepreclear. He refrains from all authoritarian or dominating conduct, leading, always, ratherthan driving. He refrains from the use of hypnotism or sedatives on the preclear no matterhow much the preclear may demand them out of aberration. He never abandons the preclearout of faint-heartedness about the ability of techniques to resolve the case, but persists andcontinues to restore the preclear’s self-determinism. The auditor keeps himself informed ofany new skills in the science.The auditor cares for himself as an auditor. By working with others he maintains hisown processing at regular intervals in order to maintain or raise his own position on the tonescale despite restimulation of himself through the process of auditing others. He knows thatfailure to give heed to his own processing, until he himself is a “release” or a “clear” in the5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"severest meaning of the terms, is to cost his preclear the benefit of the auditor’s bestperformance.The goal of the auditor is to rehabilitate the selfdeterminism of his preclear, to bringback his hope and power, to get his preclear up to where the preclear, all of his own,KNOWS.The preclear has to take very little on faith with these techniques. He simply runswhat he is told.The auditor should not bully his preclear or evaluate for him.Most important, the auditor should choose for his preclear a person worth salvaging,who will in his turn help another. We have so much to do!6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOLife is a static, according to the Axioms. A static has no motion. It has no wavelength. The proofs and details of this are elsewhere in Scientology.This static has the peculiarity of acting as a “mirror”. It records and holds the imagesof motion. It even can create motion and record and hold the image of that. It records alsospace and time in order to record motion which is, after all, only “change in space throughtime”. Played against motion as a kinetic, the static can produce live energy.In a mind, any mind, the basic beingness is found to be a static on which motion canbe recorded, and which, acting against motion, produces energy.A memory is a recording of the physical universe. It contains—any memory—a timeindex (when it happened) and a pattern of motion. As a lake reflects the trees and movingclouds, so does a memory reflect the physical universe. Sight, sound, pain, emotion, effort,conclusions, and many other things are recorded in this static for any given instant ofobservation.Such a memory we call a “facsimile”. The mind, examining a facsimile it has made,can see it, feel it, hear it, re-experience the pain in it, the effort, the emotion.There are billions of facsimiles available to any mind. Billions of billions. Thesefacsimiles can be brought into present time by the environment, and “unseen” or “unknown”by the awareness of awareness of the mind, can reimpress their pains, efforts, and aberrationsupon the being, thus making one less liable to survive. All unknowingnesses, confusion’s,aberrations, psychosomatic ills are traceable to facsimiles.One believes he can use any facsimile he has ever received. He has been hurt. He usesthe facsimile of being hurt to hurt another. But since one survives as well as everything elsesurvives, to hurt another is wrong. One regrets the injury, seeking to turn back time (which25 regret). Thus the facsimile he used becomes interlocked with his facsimile of trying to useit and both facsimiles “hang up” and travel with present time. One even gets the pain heseeks to inflict on another, this being the action against him of the facsimile he sought togive, by action, to another. It startles the preclear, when run through a boyhood fight, whereinhe hit another boy in the eye, to feel the pain in his own eye at the instant of the blow. And soit is with all inflicted injuries.This is a simple matter of the interaction of the pictures of energy.This is a “maybe”, indecision, inaction. This is aberration—trying to do unto otherswhat was done to you—good or bad.An interplay of static against motion or between two classes of motion, one relativelystatic to the other, can and does produce active electrical energy in beings of differentcharacteristics and potentials. This makes a living being an electrical field more capable ofhigh potential and varieties of waves than are known to nuclear physics, of whichScientology is a basic.This created energy played lightly over a “facsimile” reactivates it and causes it tobear upon a being once more. This is an activity of thinking.A “facsimile” brought into play by a moment of intense activity may afterwards,when the being is again producing only normal energy output, “refuse” to be handled by thelower energy. This facsimile then can trap the energy of a being and turn upon him the pain,emotion, and other things recorded in the facsimile. The facsimile thus can absorb energy and7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"give pain, especially when the being holding it has forgotten it or does not perceive it. This isrestimulation.By concentrating a live energy flow upon a facsimile directly, the being can erase,disintegrate, or “explode” or “implode” it.As heavy facsimiles are the hidden source of human aberration and psychosomaticillness, their erasure or better handling by the being is intensely desirable.The remedy of human aberration and illness is a minor goal of Scientology. Itsdiscoveries make this possible.8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEIf Life—or theta, as it is called in Scientology (q )—is a mirror and a creator ofmotion which can be mirrored, it follows then that mirror-wise, the whole of the laws ofmotion, magnetism, energy, matter, space and time can be found in thought, and behaviorand even thinking partake of the physical universe laws regarding matter, energy, space andtime. Thus even the laws of Newton can be found operative in thought. Fortunately all this isbeyond the need of an auditor’s immediate grasp of the subject for if it were not, an auditorwould have to be first a nuclear physicist before he could begin to make the lame well andthe able more able.Some understanding of the matter is, however, desirable—otherwise some very weirdphilosophies would develop which would benefit none. Man has been ridden to death byphilosophies which, unproven by any result, yet achieved enough prominence to spoil many asociety (Schopenhauer or Nietzsche, for example). And many a scientific effort has falleninto disrepute because of philosophic misrepresentation.Kant and Hegel all but ruined any hope nuclear physics or the humanities had by wildmisinterpretation (in resounding language) of Indian philosophy and other early efforts toresolve the riddle of existence. So let us see how very basic and simple are the reasons whywe audit what we audit.Life can create motion or use motion or mirror motion.Motion is a change in space. Any change involves time. Conversely, for there to betime, there must be change. If no change occurs we have the illusion of a static again.The main trouble with facsimiles is that they “hang up” in time, then become timelessand then give the concept of “no change”. Our preclear, desiring to change for the better,cannot change because he is “hung up” in a memory which he “can’t” change. The auditorwants change. Timelessness or forgiveness prevents change and these unwelcome conditionscome about when a facsimile “hangs up” in present time. This makes the preclear feel he isunable to change. No matter what you do for him, if you do not get him “into present time”or (the same thing) get the facsimiles out of present time, you have “no change”.Thus we had better know what makes a facsimile “hang up”, and, “hung Up”, actupon the preclear.We see that a facsimile is a mirror of old motions. It is undone and gotten out ofpresent time by dropping out its “motion”.Only the mind can put the “motion” of a facsimile back into motion in the physicaluniverse.I he facsimile is “made” by the mind’s ability to duplicate the wave or motionpatterns of the physical universe.A “live” attention unit operates only in present time. A facsimile is composed of“dead” attention units, a pattern once made by “live” units in some past present time. Forexample, one sees a man. His attention units could be said in that instant to make up thepattern of what he sees. A moment later, he has a facsimile made up of “dead” attention units.He can “sec” this man again simply by throwing live units at patterns of dead units. Thefacsimile can come “alive” and active only when scanned by live units. Then, it can stay“alive” so long as live units are fixed on it. It will not “run out” or dissipate unless a largenumber of live units are played on it. Thus, a facsimile can “hang up”. This is an analogy, butit will do for an auditor.9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"An auditor can “see” his preclear as a mind which is surrounded by old facsimileswhich arc given just enough attention to keep them “in present time”. It is the task of theauditor to drop all facsimiles into an inactive state. It is a grim fact that one really doesn’tthink with these heavy facsimiles. One could survive quite well if he had no facsimiles!Thought can pervade an area or approximate a situation and know. The mind thinkswith light facsimiles, or no facsimiles at all.Thus there is a compulsion early on the track to have facsimiles. Then, as one ceasesto “know”, one is at length no longer in control of his facsimiles but is their victim. Givenenough facsimiles, a man dies; a theta being decays until it can’t even be a Man.How, then, does one strip away facsimiles from the present time of the preclear? Theauditor would have to audit billions of them to erase all the facsimiles the preclcar has madeor “borrowed” and which now act heavily upon him, giving him illness, degradation andaberration—as well as amnesia as to his actual past.We can rehabilitate the preclear by raising his ability to create energy, and thus bringhim to a “speed” which has sufficient output for him to overcome facsimiles. We do this byerasing or reducing certain facsimiles, and, in doing so, retrain our preclear to produce ahigher energy potential.10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURA wave length is a characteristic of motion. Many motions are too random, toochaotic to have orderly wave lengths. An orderly wave length is a flow of motion. It has aregular repeated distance between its crests. Take a rope or a garden hose and give it a flip.You will see a wave travel along it. Energy, whether electrical, light, or sound, has some suchpattern.This is a smooth flowing wave. Its length is between crests. It is measured in units oflength such as centimeters or inches or feet.A flow can have many patterns.These still have wave length. We are not much interested here in patterns orcharacteristics. We are interested in lengths.Here are some rough estimates of wave lengths which produce reactions on the mind,a tone scale of wave lengths. (Accurate lengths not given here. )ToneWaveLengthq_________________________________________________•or 0.0.0000000000000000000000000239.0_________________________________________________cm.aesthetics.00000028.0_________________________________________________cm.analytical thought.0241.5_________________________________________________cm.emotion11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Note how gross is emotion, how tiny is the wave producing aesthetics (art).A wave length is not the power of a wave. A small length, given enough volume, isdeadlier or stronger than a gross wave.Now we see that a facsimile can have a mirrored set of wave lengths which match anywave in the physical universe. Actually, theta can create waves. Thus a facsimile can containheavy effort or emotion and throw that back at the preclear. A facsimile, restimulated by thepreclear’s attention units, can contain enough force to bow his back out of shape, scar hisflesh, give him actual electrical shocks, or make him hot enough to run a fever, to saynothing of changing his ideas.Theta can be forced to have a facsimile it did not create. Hit a man, operate on him,beat him, give him a shock—he then will have a facsimile which can reactivate when hisattention units, later on, accidentally sweep over it.However, theta, to be made to have and hold any facsimile, must be “built down”.The only reason theta will hold to a facsimile, the only mechanical way it can hold anyfacsimile, is by having it attached to theta itself.We can see that facsimiles are unnecessary, restrictive, and in short, are controlmechanisms. To control anyone, it is necessary to do one of two things:(1) Give him a basic facsimile strong enough to put him in pain if he fails to obey it;(2) Build on such heavy facsimiles.For example, a dog is beaten for barking and told to be quiet. Afterwards it is onlynecessary to tell him to be quiet. This is both operations in one.In the case of a man—much sturdier stuff than a dog—it requires a very heavyfacsimile as a basic, and facsimiles such as operations, accidents, beatings have to have as abasic facsimiles so strong their counterpart cannot as yet be duplicated on Earth. The basicfacsimile must answer a very important condition: its wave lengths must have, at least in part,a near approximation of theta itself.What wave most closely approximates theta? It would be one of nearly infinitesmallness, and that wave is found to be aesthetic, the wave length of the arts.Reason, analytical waves, are too coarse to attain theta’s zero or infinity “wavelength”. Art alone may do so.The proof of all this is its workability. And it works. We have, then:AestheticsReasonEmotionEffortTo make theta hold a facsimile of emotion or effort, or even reason, the facsimileitself must contain an aesthetic wave. The last alone can hold the recordings of pain, grief,exhaustion, aberration and force in upon theta.If we had to take the emotion, effort, and reason or mis-reason off the whole track, wewould have a long task. If we remove the compulsions toward aesthetics, we have cut awaythe only bridge by which heavy facsimiles can be appended to theta. Theta manufacturesaesthetics. Implanted aesthetic waves, then, if strong enough, could obsess theta into actingon enforced aesthetics.12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"This does not say aesthetics are bad. It says enforced aesthetics are bad. You can’tbeat a woman into being beautiful. You could beat her into being obsessed about beauty.That which you see as beautiful of your free will gladdens you. Out of an obsessiveaberration, all beauty becomes hideous even when the aberree cries out how lovely it is.Just as we have enforced and inhibited ARC, we have enforced and inhibitedaesthetics. These, processed, drop off the heavy facsimiles which are thus tied to theta.Process aesthetics and occlusions vanish and current life can be cleared in a few hours.But what manner of incident is held by an aesthetic wave and how is it processed? Itis so simple.13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVENeither you nor a preclear need accept “whole track” or the identity of the thetan asdescribed fully in What to Audit (A History of Man). Not to begin. You’ll very rapidly makeup your own mind about it when you start the process “Black and White”.To audit an “assist”, a grief charge, an engram, see earlier works. These items are stillwith us. That “Black and White” solves engrams and locks wholesale does not mean singleincident running is not effective and that it should not be known. But these and theirtechniques have no place here in “8-80”.Single incident processing, effort processing, the running of secondaries all arereplaced by “Black and White”. Straight wire, lock scanning, valence shifting all are replacedby “concept processing”. The wide-open case, however, is processed on single incidents andconcepts as necessary, for the wide-open case does not see white except in an actualelectronic.The reason for this is that “Black and White” and “concept running” make clears,MEST and theta, in a very short time and they are so simple that one cannot mistake any ofhis moves. While an auditor can get complete results with them, they do not try his wits.They are 1, 2, 3 processes.Concept processing and “Black and White” mean the goals of Scientology will bereached very soon. They mean that none in Scientology should be other than a MEST clear.As for “whole track” and thetans, I wouldn’t dare say a word if “Black and White”didn’t show them up with alarming velocity. A preclear can soar so in tone on “whole track”and “Black and White” that his capabilities so acquired cannot be ignored even by thebitterest foe of truth and freedom.As detailed in What to Audit, there are many electronic implants on the whole track.In other words, any preclear has, in the last few thousand years, been placed in an electronicfield and rendered null, void and obsessed by heavy “electrical” currents.The object was slavery, a compulsion to be good and obedient, and to have a MESTbody.As one makes a dog tame by beating him, one has been made to obey by being beatenwith force fields.A heavy blow gives amnesia. A heavy force field can utterly nullify the entirepersonalness of a being.You will not be long in the processing before you finally discover to your own joythat you are you, not a perishable MEST body.You will find electronic incidents very vicious and so heavy that they push one downscale to a not-beingness which is summed up by “I am not”, “I know not”. Disbelief, distrust,and many other low scale concepts rise as you run these heavy incidents.Somatics of great conviction, however, await your first contact with “Black andWhite”.The electronic fields are ready to be run. They are in “present time”. They containheavy effort and emotion. And they also contain an aesthetic band. The aesthetic wavesalone pin these facsimiles to theta. You run out the aesthetic wave band and you have run theincident.14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXThe running of “Black and White” is very simple: simple to do, easy to audit.The best auditing and the fastest by far is done with the E-Meter. The meterpractically runs the case. Most important, it spares the auditor from too close a concentrationon his preclear’s reactive mind, the only aberrative thing about auditing.“Black and White” can be self-audited, but in this case the E-Meter becomes quitevital.Tell any preclear to “see” if he can find a “white area” around him. He will perceive,clearly or weakly, a blackness or a spotty black-whiteness, a grayness, or a whiteness aroundhim, above him, or below him. It may be in patterns or there may be color in it. You don’twant ANYTHING but WHITENESS.Tell the preclear to “turn it all white”. He will find that if he puts his attention in thecenter of the sphere, or if he pushes or pulls a little, he can get the field white.Tell him to keep it white. He will have to change and shift his attention around in thefield but he can do it. If his attention keeps slipping off, the field will turn black on him.Keep telling him to put his attention back on the place that turns the area around him white.If you have him on a meter, as you should, you will be able to “read” exactly what ishappening.If the needle steadily climbs to the left (rises), he is keeping the field white. Theincident is running out.If the needle stops or is “sticky”, he has a large section of black in the field he mustmake white. The incident, with black in it, is not running out.If the needle rises and jerks suddenly to the right(drops), he has just gotten a somaticand the suddenness and amount of the drop measure the amount of pain.To audit, all you do is make him keep the field white. Black spots will appear justbefore the somatic hits. Theoretically, the entire incident could be run without somaticssimply by keeping it white.The aesthetic wave is all you want out of the incident. This gone, the rest vanishes. Itis like having a heavy curtain hanging by a thin strip. Cut the strip and you cut down thewhole curtain.15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Run the aesthetic band only. The incident is gone. Run out the heavy electronicincidents and all heavy facsimiles go, for only an electronic can keep a thetan aberrated andform a base “sticky” enough to cause other incidents and locks to stay in present time orrestimulate.When the preclear cannot get the field, an electronic flow is bouncing him. Get hisattention to the flow source and keep putting it back every time it bounces until he canmanage it. Or, unburden the case with concept running, for if he cannot get white, you musttake off some of the “upper” burden of locks by concept running.What of boil-off???Boil-off, that sinking into grogginess or even unconsciousness, cannot be permitted. Itwastes time and does no good.How to stop it? Your pc is sending or receiving a white flow. If he stays at it untilafter he should have reversed it, it goes black and he will start to boil. By quickly shifting theflow of attention or direction of motion in the incident, whiteness returns and the tendency to“boil-off” vanishes.Hence, by discovering the source of boil offs and how to stop them, we save muchtime.16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENWhat do we mean by aesthetic?We mean solely, and only, Beautiful.Beauty is theta. Any wave close to theta is taken by theta for beauty. A harmony ofwave motion is evidently a lower harmonic of beauty. A disharmony of wave motion, nomatter how high the wave length, is ugliness. But ugliness is also a wave, a disharmony withthe wave length of beauty* but very close to it.Light and dark waves, as they appear to attention units, go in harmonics all the waydown the scale from .00000000000000000000000002 centimeters to the bottom.It must be remarked that this is an approximation, a rough analogy, for the auditor,not the engineer.Do NOT get beauty entangled here with LOVE or anything else but beauty. Beauty isa wave length closely resembling theta or a harmony approximating theta. Ugliness is adisharmony in wave discord with theta.Theta will stop ugliness or disharmony or try to stop it; that is to say, the wave ofugliness will disrupt theta.This may sound quite poetic. It is, in fact, very “hard boiled” engineering. It is just amatter of wave lengths, apparently.Thus an incident must have a beauty factor if it is to append itself to theta. Or it mustbe underlain by an incident with such a beauty factor.The “beauty” in this case, and where we will find it to audit, is actually a counterfeitof theta, an obsessive beauty which enforces beauty and forbids ugliness. Theta, left alone,will seek beauty and fight or shun ugliness. It would have to be able to if it could beaberrated into an obsession about beauty. That this obsession is present, an auditing testleaves no doubt.If your preclear will run the concept of beauty in the white of an electronic incidentand the concept of ugliness on the black if it insists on coming in, the incident will run out.Direct the preclear’s attention to the white and have him get the concept that it isbeautiful. He will not have to employ much effort to keep it white if he keeps this concept.If the black keeps encroaching, have him run the concept of ugliness on it. It will loseforce.Some preclears are so badly aberrated that black has become the only desirable shade.Here is the criminal. The preclear can run how beautiful black is. He won’t do it for long.The original incidents when they were laid in were designed to be obsessive. Mosthave the beauty-ugly motive. This makes the victim obsessed to keep all calm and not fight. 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"There are even scenes—”hot facsimile” pictures made of raw energy—to show himbeauty. As if theta had no concept.The other twin which a preclear gets in some incidents is good-evil. Good is a rationallevel wave, a harmonic on beauty, much lower. It evolves into beauty when run and should toget the incident free. Evil, of course, is as black as white is good. Religious obsessiveincidents (complete with religious scenes) come in easily and run when the white is run withthe concept “good”. This soon goes up scale to beauty.All electronic incidents run out on “black and white” with the concept of beauty andwith a placing of attention so that the white turns on as bright as possible.These incidents were intended to be confusing, the better to make a slave obey (theythought). By running half the waves one way and half the other, a beauty-ugly conflict wascreated.UpanddownwhiteBackandforthwhiteOne side appears to go black when the other is run.

The preclear “gets the idea” of knowing or not beingand holds it, the while looking at his time track. The concept runs out, or the somatic it bringson runs out, and the concept itself is run. It is not addressed at individual incidents but athundreds.A concept is a high wave thought, above perception or reason or single incidents.Thus as concepts are run, many incidents may tumble into view.Concepts can be “in-run” or “out-run”. This would be somebody having the conceptof the preclear or the preclear having the concept himself. If the preclear runs a concept andstarts to boil-off, have him reverse the flow. If he was running it as his own, have him run itas another’s and he will immediately cease the boil-off.You can have a concept of anything, even a concept of confusion. The top and bottompoints on the scales of the Chart of Attitudes (See Handbook for Preclears) make goodconcept material.BUT, the only concepts we have to use in running out locks or whole lives, knockingaway scores of incidents at a time, are:• Beauty• Ugliness• Cause of ugliness• Cause of beauty• No-sympathy• Sympathy• Good• EvilWherever there is an occlusion on a case, make the preclear run these on it.

He will find occasionally that heoften has a difficult time when a particularly heavy facsimile is in restimulation and, do whathe will, the auditor may find his preclear’s tone remains unchanged and that the preclear’sattitudes have not evolved to a better high.We now come to “The Governor”, mentioned in a lecture in the Autumn of 1951. Thespeed of a preclear is the speed of his production of energy.The most important step in establishing a preclear’s self-determinism, the main goalof the auditor, is the rehabilitation of the preclear’s ability to produce energy.A being is, apparently, an energy production source. How does he produce liveenergy without mechanical means, cellular activity, or food?The basic principle of energy production by a being has been copied in electronics. Itis very simple. A difference of potential of two areas can establish an energy flow ofthemselves. Carbon batteries, electric generators, and other producers of electrical flows acton the principle that a difference of energy potential in two or more areas can cause anelectrical impulse to flow between or amongst them.The preclear is static and kinetic, meaning he is no-motion and motion. These,interplaying, produce electrical flow.A preclear as a static can hold two or more energy flows of different wave lengths inproximity and between them obtain a flow.A preclear can hold a difference of flow between two waves and a static so long (andarduously) that the effect of a discharging condenser can be obtained. This can “explode” afacsimile.The preclear flows electrical currents of command at the body. These hit pre-established ridges (areas of dense waves) and cause the body to perceive or act. The precleartakes from the body perception with tractor beams. He holds the body still or braces himselfagainst it by wrapping a tractor (pulling) beam around it while he places a pressor (pushing)beam at his back to command himself into action. (You can almost break a preclear’s spineby asking him to contract his own tractor around his body and yet withhold the pressoragainst his spine.)All an auditor really needs to know about this is the elementary method of using adifference of potential. That creates energy.The only thing wrong with a preclear with an aged MEST body is that he has toomany facsimiles of his tractors and pressors handling his own MEST body and the ricketystate of the body feeds back “slowness” so that he thinks his energy is low—and until workedwith some method such as this, facsimiles do not reduce.Any difference of potential played one against the other creates energy. Aestheticwaves against a static produce energy. Aesthetic waves against analytical waves produceenergy. Analytical waves against emotional waves produce energy. Emotional waves againsteffort waves produce energy. Effort against matter produces energy.The last is the method used on Earth in generating electrical current for power. Theothers are equally valid and produce even higher flows. This is a gradient scale of beingness,from the zero-infinity of theta to the solidity of matter.22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The differences of potential most useful are easy to run.This is, actually, alternating current running. There can be DC running or chainfission running but these are very experimental at this writing.AC is created by the static holding first one, then the other, of a dichotomy of twodifferences of potential. A flow is run in one direction with one of the pair, then in the otherdirection with the other.The dichotomies are:1. SurviveSuccumb16.FuturePast2.AffinityNo affinity17.EveryoneNobody3.

He flows a feeling, athought (NEVER THE PHRASE!) of “agreement” out or in, in the direction he choosesrelative to himself. He lets this flow until it turns smoky gray or white, then black. Then hechanges the direction of flow and gets the thought or feeling of “disagreement”. He runs thisuntil it turns gray or white, then black. When this has turned black or dark, he again runs“agreement” in its direction until he gets gray or white, then again black. Now he reverses theflow and flows the thought “disagreement” until he gets gray or white, then blackness. Andso on and on.It will be noted that at first it may take some little time for a flow to run from blackthrough white to black. As the preclear continues to run, after minutes or many hours, he23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"begins to run faster, then faster and faster until at last he can keep a flow blazing andcrackling.A method of aberrating beings was to give them white and black energy sources intheir vicinity. These show up on a very low tone occluded case as blazing white and shiningwhite. That is an electronic incident, not his own energy flow. These run blazing white in onedirection for minutes or hours before they go black. They then run the other way, blazingwhite, almost as long.WHEN BLACK PREDOMINATES IN SUCH INCIDENTS THEY DO NOTDIMINISH OR REDUCE. ASK THE PRECLEAR IN SUCH A CASE TO DO WHAT HE“HAS TO DO” TO GET THE INCIDENT ALL WHITE.As the preclear runs, he finds the speed of the change of flow changes more and morerapidly until it runs like a vibration. This vibration, theoretically, can increase to a strongcurrent which becomes so great it is well to ground your preclear by using an E-Meter orletting him hold a wire in each hand which is connected to a bare water pipe or radiator.Otherwise, his MEST body may be damaged by the flow.Run a dichotomy only against its mate. Run in alternating directions until the flowturns black.Don’t run a black “flow”. It doesn’t flow or run out.24"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVESelf-determinism is whiteness and self-made energy to the preclear. The energy lookswhite to him.Self-determinismOther-determinismis the basic dichotomy. The self-determinism looks white, other-determinism looksblack.Electronic incidents are a mockery of this. They made the preclear think his owndeterminism had other determinism it must fight. White beauty must fight black ugliness.White good must fight black evil.You will sometimes see your preclear is fighting, pushing, struggling instead ofgetting flows. He has encountered a black mock-up which he thinks he has to fight. This isthe aberration—that one is not Eighth Dynamic Cause but is only First Dynamic Cause. Tobecome free he must be Cause as nearly as possible on eight dynamics. He cannot be fullyresponsible—and thus responsible for his facsimiles—unless he is Cause. If he is notresponsible for his facsimiles, he then can be injured by them, can be the Effect of theirCause.One requires the preclear, in such a case of fighting, to run the dichotomy, not juststrain at the black. He may protest, saying he “cannot accept it”; ask him to run acceptanceanyway, or get him into something lighter.At first your preclear may be unable even to find gray. In such a case, get him topretend somebody is before him saying something to him. Ask him to run the flow of hisown agreement. Then ask him to run his own flow of disagreement. Shortly he will sensehow long he must run each. Even if he runs only on this conceptual level, he will improvemarkedly in tone and, of course, energy potential.Your preclear must be able to recognize a tractor, a pulling wave, and realize that ithas two directions of flow. As you point out that he has a tractor-pressor combination on hisMEST body, he probably can find it. You can point out that other persons have put them onhis body and that he has put them on others. He will find how to make them flow, for thetractor is just a holder so that a pressor can be used, or a puller to make someone fall, or stopsomebody or something from falling.The only one he would not find for himself is the tractor he gives others to make themwant things from him and tractors they have extended to him to make him want things fromthem. These last lead straight into art and the second dynamic.The most important dichotomies to run are:Agree BeautyDisagree UglinessBut all those listed are useful. However, do not force him to use and try to preventhim from using:Emotion EffortEffort MatterThese fall away of themselves evidently when the others are run.25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENThere are certain emotional concepts which are very effective and should be used.One holds one of these concepts and agrees and disagrees with it. He holds theconcept and gets the flow on it by agreeing and disagreeing on the concept to subjects to keepthem gray or white.The concept of beauty is run by holding the idea of a beautiful state of affairs andthen agreeing and disagreeing (to keep gray or white) on the locks and flows which turn up.Similarly, one handles the following concepts:UglinessBeautiful sadnessDegradationNo-sympathySympathyPropitiationMaking amendsGuiltHidingExhibitionismBeautiful crueltyThe beautiful sadness of losingThe beautiful sadness of any dichotomyThe beauty of winningThe beauty of any dichotomyThe desire of any dichotomyThe inhibition of any dichotomyOne runs things as close to thought as possible and as far from effort.One runs things in brackets.The word “bracket” is taken from the artillery, meaning to enclose within a salvo offire.A bracket is run as follows:First, one gets the concept as happening to the preclear.Then, one gets the concept of the preclear making it happen (or thinking or saying it)to another.Then one gets the concept as being directed by another at others.Then, one uses all these on the other side of the dichotomy.A bracket on “Beauty of being an individual” would be as follows:“Get how beautiful it is for you to be an individual. “When he has run this for awhile, keeping it gray or white by agreeing or disagreeingwith the flows, “Get how beautiful it is for others to be an individual”. He runs this until heisn’t very interested, changing its flows by agreeing or disagreeing, and then:26"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"“Get how beautiful people think it is for others to be individuals”.

It can be done with any dichotomy. The standard bracket, theone you will use most, is based on beauty and ugliness with agree and disagree as the flowconcepts and with the other dichotomies as the varied thought.If your preclear can get no concept on beauty, have him run the tone scale on it asfollows, having him agree and disagree to get a flow:Apathy about beauty (motionless)Grief about beautyFear of beautyResentment of beautyAnger at beautyAntagonism toward beautyBoredom about beautyConservatism about beautyEnthusiasm about beautyExhilaration about beautyRun this scale wherever he can get it and then continue to run it on the others until hehas at last become able to get the feeling of beauty. He will get being taught what is beautifulor trying to understand beauty and many other concepts.Your preclear may run into a heavy electronic incident. These are covered fully inWhat to Audit. If he does, you can run it by getting him to “turn it white” and “keep it white”.If he can’t, get him into lighter material.27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENThe manifestations of energy are three in number. These are: flow, dispersal andridges.Utilizing flows, dispersals and ridges, there are several patterns of life energy. Theseinclude pressor beams, tractor beams and screens. The screen is actually a ridge that isformed for a special purpose of protection.Any line of flow, whether contracting or lengthening, is called a flow. A commonmanifestation is seen in an electric light wire.A dispersal is formed by a source emanating. This may or may not be an explosion.Any source with a multiple direction emanation can be called a dispersal.A ridge is caused by two energy flows coinciding and causing an enturbulence ofenergy which, on examination, is found to take on a characteristic which in energy flows isvery like matter, having its particles in chaotic mixture.A particular type of dispersal is a reverse dispersal, or an implosion.As an illustration, a beam of sight would be emanating from a source point andflowing toward something to be seen. Striking a reverse flow, it can form a ridge. Striking asolid object, it would form, on the face of that object, a ridge.All energy behaviors are manifestations of these characteristics of energy.Energy is subdivisible into a large motion, such as a flow, a dispersal, or a ridge, anda small motion which is itself commonly called a “particle” in nuclear physics.Agitation within agitation is the basic formation of particles of energy, such aselectrons, protons and others. These are not, as their Greek name “atom” once told us aboutthe atom, indivisible. Energy flows have many forms, and each form is reducible to a smallervibration.The characteristic of any vibration is that it contains the manifestations of a static anda kinetic. A static is something with no motion, no particle and no wave length; and a kineticis something which has considerable motion. The interplay between the static and one ormore kinetics causes energy interchanges.The entire principle of alternating currents, as drawn in most books on electricity, isin error. This shows a positive terminal and a negative terminal, discharging one against theother, rotationally so as to create an alternating current flow. As part of Scientology, it isoriginated that the principle is in error by the fact that the negative terminal must have a plusnegative, and the positive terminal must have a negative positive to form such aninterchange. Past technology, in describing the alternating current flow, and the describing ofall energy manifestations and manufactures, forgets continually the base. This is representedin an electrical generator by the base of the generator itself. The solid iron base of thegenerator fastened to a floor or table imposes time and space upon the two terminals. Withoutthis imposition of time and space, no energy could be possible. A great deal of mechanicalmotion must be put into an electrical generator because an electrical generator is dischargingbetween the dichotomy of effort and matter, a lower range dichotomy. In the higher ranges,the static is furnished by the individual, and the mathematical symbol for this near-ultimate istheta.Self-determinism is entirely and solely the-imposition of time and space upon energyflows. Imposing time and space upon objects, people, self, events and individuals is28"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Causation. The total components of one’s self-determinism is the ability to impose time andspace. His energy is derived from the discharge of high and low, or different, potentials towhich he has assigned time and space. Dwindling sanity is a dwindling ability to assign timeand space. Psychosis is a complete inability to assign time and space. This is, as well, willpower.In life one finds the static operating against the kinetic of the material universe whichitself has motion. A static takes pictures of the motion which it can place and reactivate atwill. It uses these pictures of motion as terminals. The types of motion in the terminalsdischarge one against the other in accordance with the experience desired by the life force.Relative speeds determine potential.The speed of light is not a constant of energy speed. The shorter the period ofemission of energy from a source, which is to say, the shorter the wave length of the energy,the greater is the speed of that energy. As one ranges up the tone scale one comes into thenear instantaneousness of thought. And very high on the tone scale one finds thought so closeto the static that the static is capable of assigning the thought with the time into the past andinto the future without regard to the time factor imposed upon the MEST universe, alsoevidently by some such static.Far from some mystic concept, the static and kinetic principles of energy interchangecan be fundamental to nuclear physics. “Attention units” are actually energy flows of smallwave lengths and definite frequency. These are measurable on specially designedoscilloscopes and meters. No special particle is involved, but one can designate the particle ofsuch flows as “corbitrons”*, if one desires to be technical.The constant of light has been a sort of scientific ridge locking scientific thought.Within the spectrum of light itself there is a measurable difference of speed, and in the higherspectrum of reason and aesthetics, the speed of light is very fast. The speed of emotion, onthe other hand, which is a gross wave, is evidently quite slow.One can conceive of an ultimate static which would be theta, and an ultimate motionwhich would be MEST. The interplay to create energy, however, can be much narrower. Onehas observed preclears try to run pleasure and find only pain. He has observed them run painand find pleasure, but less often. The direct current and condenser discharges are determinedby wave characteristic. One can create a pleasure facsimile and discharge pain into it, aprimary function of imagination.The life source itself IS energy. The energy potential of beings can be varied slightlywithin one being and is quite different from individual to individual as a basic quality.The life source of the individual is interior in most persons because it has built up,with its earlier flows, ridges which themselves have the same wave length as the life sourceof the person. The life source, then, cannot distinguish between himself and these ridges.These ridges are facsimiles, or pictures, of motion. They are used by the life source to turnthe body into a stimulus-response, or automatic, mechanism. By means of such ridges, thelife source can turn the body into an automaton which will operate for him. However, as thelife source goes down tone scale, it itself can become enturbulated and less able to imposetime and space upon his facsimiles. He cannot distinguish between himself and a ridge whichis an apparent identity.The name given to this life source is “thetan”. It is the individual, the being, thepersonality, the knowingness of the human being.The state of the human being is artificial, the thetan using the body for his ownpleasure and convenience. A thetan, having done so, ordinarily forgets he is doing so, and inorder to increase his randomity initially, suppresses the fact that he is separate from the body.29"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"He then becomes identified with the body to such a degree that should the body die, heabandons to it, he supposes, but not actually, all the facsimiles which have been accumulatedfor that body.If the preclear refers to “his thetan”, he has not identified himself, since he supposeshis thetan to be something else, or elsewhere. He is the thetan, and when he is in a state ofknowingness, he knows where he is. If he is in a state of unknowingness, which is to sayidentified with the body, he does not know where he is.When a thetan has come down tone scale to the minus scale, he no longer believeshimself capable of the production of power, he cannot select facsimiles for interchanges, andhe becomes an unknowingly motivating portion of the person, but all the person ever will beis the thetan.The genetic entity is of very little concern.These manifestations of energy, and the life source, can be discovered easily by thetechnique which has now been developed.The formula of the energy of life source which has been tentatively advanced is:Life = (E*I / -R) * (-f)If: E = Energy Potential I = Energy Flow -R = Negative Resistance -f = Negative FrequencyThe theory of the counter-elasticity of flow is easily observed on an oscilloscope andis possibly the negative frequency. An energy line will flow, whether in space or in aconfined conduit, just so long before it accumulates sufficient enturbulence to stop. Itrequires, then, an enormous forcing potential behind it to continue its flow. This is resistance,and is, indeed, the resistance in electrical wires, and is one of the main reasons why powerhas to be furnished to a generator. The flow, when it has gone to the limit of the elasticity ofthe particles it contains, will then discharge backwards against its direction of flow, and ifagitated, will do so. A flow must flow in one direction and then in the reverse direction, andwithin the limits of the elasticity of flow, in order to create an energy which does not requireheavy potentials to keep it in flow.While the conservation of energy is a useful principle, in basic physics andelementary nuclear physics, such as those used in the creation of the atom bomb, and in theformulas of Lorentz-Fitzgerald, its practical application is demonstrable only between effortand matter on the tone scale, and is useful within the bounds of mechanical motion andactivity in the material universe only. That thought may be seen occasionally to violate theconservation of energy does not immediately cancel the fact that thought is part of thematerial universe and is as much energy as electrons, protons and electric lights. Thought isself-perpetuating so long as it operates in the bands above emotion. When it falls below theband of emotion, it ceases to perpetuate itself.There is much technology here which has been discovered with relationship to energyand the material universe and these principles are applicable to such things as the creation ofweapons which will cancel, or explode at a distance, the force of an atom bomb, or whichwill themselves, at a cost of two or three hundred dollars, make automatic firing blasts on thelevel of an atomic explosion. Nuclear physics has been in its infancy and a great deal ofpioneer work has been possible in the field. It should not be considered that nuclear physicshas invaded the field of life, any more than the humanities have invaded the field of physics.Energy manifestations have a single applicable pattern. And those patterns apply as well to30"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"thought as they apply to electrical flows. It is simply that we have advanced a technologytoward a logical conclusion and have obtained logical results.These results are revealed, at this time, only because they can be demonstrated easily,with oscilloscopes, with groundings, with the manufacture of energy, and in the field ofhumanities most importantly with the restoration of life energy and vitality to human beings,with according enhancement of sanity and activity.*The term suggested by John Robinson and Dillard Eubank.31"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENThe reason your preclear is fixed to a MEST body lies in his inability to produceenergy enough to know and to get away from one.His career with bodies is as follows:He hurt them by accident first.Then he hurt them without understanding they hurt by using their sexual emotion.Then he blamed them and said and felt he would have no responsibility for them.Then he felt the emotion of no-sympathy for them.Then he felt sympathy.He began to propitiate.He wanted to make amends.He was a MEST body. *Run the beauty and ugliness of these.The cycle of no-sympathy-equals-sympathy is inevitable. That for which we declareno-sympathy today will receive our sympathy tomorrow.If you have a preclear sight some old body well before him and feel no-sympathy forit, he then will feel no-sympathy, sympathy, propitiation, and suddenly, he IS the body.One runs facsimiles on the body partly because the body is an electrical ground,partly because it has been assigned responsibility.The thetan assigning responsibility to the body then becomes the body. This is ageneral principle. One becomes that to which he assigns responsibility too often and too long.He makes it Cause and, at last, to be Cause himself, he must be the thing.People imagine they are in bodies because they are hiding from something and manyother reasons. But these are not important. The important thing is that bodies were handy tohave, once. They were fun.This process, as itself, as simple as it is, will eventually detach one from his body.After that he can use it or not as he chooses.The thetan is no fairy tale. Try these techniques for fifty hours and find out. Try themon a preclear who has never heard of facsimiles, electronics, or “whole track” and in fifty orone hundred hours he will be outside wondering what he was doing in “that thing”! You mayhave intended only to increase his sanity or happiness. You do it best by processing thethetan on 8-80.*The cycle no-sympathy, sympathy, propitiation, make-amends, beingness IS thecause and cycle of the life CONTINUUM. It accounts in part for the transfer of somatics inan overt act or DED. It is a therapy in itself. It is run by itself but better with the concepts ofbeauty and ugliness, with agree and disagree on each level of the cycle. You could give thisto a practitioner by itself and he would become quite famous for relieving aches and pains,for it solves valences, the acquirement of family difficulties from parents, and a thousandother things. The cycle sometimes runs anger, no-sympathy, fear, sympathy, propitiation,make-amends, beingness. The anger factor is the holder in the incident (and has tractors withit) and the fear is a bouncer. Fear of punishment is largely the fear in this cycle during theactual act, not afterwards because of police. No-sympathy is an emotion and an action. Oneputs a black curtain before himself to prevent his feeling affinity with that which he ishurting. This is a motionlessness which turns gray and runs out on agree and disagree fromthe victim and the punisher. No-sympathy can be an occlusion for the whole track. No-sympathy is also, of course, counter-no-sympathy in many incidents.—L.R.H.32"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENBelow zero on the tone scale is applicable only to a thetan.It has been quite commonly observed that there are two positions for any individualon the tone scale. This occurs because there is a position for the composite of the thetan plushis MEST body operating in a state of unknowingness that he is not a MEST body, andbehaving according to social patterns, which give him some semblance of sanity. The otherposition on the tone scale is the position of the thetan himself, and it is necessary for us todemonstrate a negative scale in order to find the thetan at all.For the thetan you will find the scale as follows :THETAN SCALE RANGEWell below body death at \"0\" down to complete unbeingness as a thetanTHETAN PLUS BODYSocial training and education soleguarantee of sane conduct.40.0Serenity of Beingness 8.0Exhilaration 4.0Enthusiasm 3.0Conservatism 2.5Boredom 2.0Antagonism 1.8Pain 1.5Anger 1.2No Sympathy 1.1Covert Hostility 1.0Fear 0.9Sympathy 0.8Propitiation 0.5Grief 0.375 Making Amends 0.05Apathy 0.0Being a Body (Death)- 0.02Being Other Bodies- 1.0Punishing Other Bodies- 1.3Responsibility as Blame- 1.5Controlling Bodies- 2.2Protecting Bodies- 3.0Owning Bodies- 3.5Approval from Bodies- 4.0Needing Bodies- 8.0HidingThis sub-zero tone scale shows that the thetan is several bands below knowingness asa body and so he will be found in the majority of cases. In our homo sapiens he will bediscovered to be below zero on the tone scale. The zero to four plus tone scale wasformulated on, and referred to, bodies and the activity of thetans with bodies. In order, then,to discover the state of mind of the thetan, one must examine the sub-zero scale. He has sometrained patterns as a body which make it possible for him to know and to be. As himself, hehas lost all beingness, all pride, all memories, and all self-determined ability, but yet has anautomatic response-mechanism in himself which continues furnishing his energy.EACH ONE OF THE ABOVE POINTS ON THE SCALE IS RUN AS POSITIVEAND NEGATIVE.

A thetan is lower than bodydeath, since it survives body death. It is in a state of knowingness below 0.375 only when it isidentifying itself as a body and IS, to its own thinking, the body. The BODY-PLUS-THETAN scale is from 0.0 to 4.0 and the position on this scale is established by the socialenvironment and education of the composite being and is a stimulus-response scale. Thepreclear is initially above this 0.375 on the BODY-PLUS-THETAN RANGE. Then, onauditing, he commonly drops from the FALSE TONE of the BODY-PLUS-THETAN scaleand into the true tone of the thetan.This is actually the only self-determined tone present— the actual tone of the thetan.From this sub-zero he quickly rises up scale through the entire range as a thetan and generallysettles at 20.0 and in command of the body and situations. The course of auditing then takesthe preclear, quite automatically, down from the FALSE TONE of the BODY-PLUS-THETAN SCALE to the actual tone of the thetan. Then the tone of the thetan rises back upthe scale level by level.It is not uncommon to find the preclear (who IS the thetan) quite raving mad underthe false “veneer” of social and educational stimulus-response training and to discover thatthe preclear, while behaving quite normally in the BODY-PLUS-THETAN state, becomesirrational in the course of auditing. BUT DESPITE THIS, the preclear is actually being farmore sane and rational than ever before and the moment he discovers himself as himself, asTHE source of energy and personality and beingness of a body, he becomes physically andmentally better. Thus the auditor must not be dismayed at the course of tone, but shouldsimply persevere until he has the thetan up into rational range. A raving mad thetan is farmore sane than a normal human being.

One would speak of ME. ME means toaberrated persons the BODY-PLUS-THETAN. ME should mean THETAN ONLY.The THETAN is a glowing unit of energy source.

On many preclearsthe thetan has so many ridges around him that he disperses all through them. This dispersionis done along communication lines. When the dispersion is auditerl out, the thetan is a unit asabove.Standing behind the body, the thetan can adjust and change any error in the body atwill. He sees these as black spots. To get rid of them one has only to get the flows necessaryto make and keep them white. Some thetans immediately gain the ability to discharge energyat will. When a thetan discharges energy, another person may feel hot.The thetan collapses into the body when the body feels pain. This was how he gottrapped. Auditing must resolve this.A thetan can get partly outside himself on a ridge. Then the preclear seems to beinside himself and yet outside. The answer in this case is to work the thetan from inside thehead, getting him to blow out ridges with beams. Just on straight beauty and ugliness on thesub-zero scale, getting concepts and feelings, the thetan eventually will come outside—butthis may take a very long time, even as much as two or three hundred hours. The techniquesof the next chapter are faster. Bring the thetan outside and work him; then he has his ownidentity.The thetan IS the preclear. The body-plus-thetan is no increase of personality. Thebody is a sort of vegetable run by the genetic entity.The thetan can clean up and heal his own body and those of others at will.The thetan is usually either blind or very dim sighted at first. He gradually regains hisability to perceive as he comes up the tone scale. He passes a band of dub-in above zero andbelow 2.0. He attains clear, brilliant sight higher on the scale.35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"One does not audit engrams with the thetan. He blows ridges to which are fastenedthousands of engrams. This is very fast auditing. Ridges are blown by locating them andturning them white. If they don’t blow at first glance, get the flow in and the flow out fromthe thetan, alternating it, until the ridge is continually gray or white and, by shifting flows,keep it so until it is gone. After flowing gray or white in one direction for a short time, aridge goes black. Then the flow is reversed and the ridge goes white or gray again. If it thenturns black, once more reverse the flow. The ridges can act like beings when sprayed withenergy or when permitted to give off energy. These are the “demon circuits of the mind”.36"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENThe summary technique of the running of the thetan is very simple and quick. Thethetan is in apathy; therefore, like a child who will no longer ask for that which will not begiven him, he negates as his fastest response.The entire technique consists of getting the thetan out of the body immediately,unburdening some of the sympathy for the body, and by running brackets, using the sub-zerotone scale, bringing him up to complete self-determinism at which time he can handle thebody with great ease.As far as psychosomatic illnesses are concerned— derangement’s of the body,malformations, malfunctions— the thetan can care for these with great ease once he has beenbrought up the tone scale. He will care for them automatically and put the body into excellentcondition.That most thetans, the moment they find themselves out of the body, desire to havenothing further to do with it, is an aberrated condition, just as it is an aberrated condition fora thetan to be fixed on having nothing to do with anything but bodies. One runs each point ofthe sub-zero scale as a dichotomy, which is to say, punishment-no punishment, owning-notowning, controlling-not controlling, being-not being. He runs these as concepts. He runsthem most opportunely with the thetan outside the body, for the thetan then is notenturbulated by all the facsimiles and ridges which he finds in his vicinity.The technique is as follows:The preclear is asked to be or not be a short distance behind his head. From thisposition, he is then asked to feel a very little bit of sympathy for the body. (Feeling too muchmay make the preclear feel as though his head were being torn off.) The person is then askedto scan out the small action of moving out of the body and into the body, and scan it outwhile out of the body. The next steps are repetitions of these, but it will be found that thedichotomies and the beautiful sadness of each dichotomy must be run to bring the thetan upinto a state of knowingness.The thetan about half the time will respond to a negative command where he will notrespond to a positive command. 1Occasionally a person must be audited by running facsimiles before he can be placedin a situation where he can leave the body, but in most cases, this will not be necessary. It,however, is necessary on occasion for the auditor to run facsimiles. And in any event, heshould know all he can discover about facsimiles, manifestations of the body, entities, andother matters contained in the body of Scientology, or otherwise he will find phenomenawhich he will, possibly, misconstrue.The facsimiles in the body are fastened onto ridges. These ridges generally appearblack to the thetan. They will turn white if the individual is asked to find out what the ridge issaying and then the individual is asked to own it, or remove it, and the ridge or black spotwill turn white and disappear, often with a considerable somatic. These ridges are discoveredin the vicinity of the motor controls, or may be all through the body.During the process of getting the thetan out of the body (and remember, this is gettingthe preclear out of his body) the thetan is not, repeat not something else or somebody else butis the preclear; and if the preclear doesn’t know that this is himself out of his body and thathe is out of his body, he will have to be run on sub-zero tone scale concepts until he can atlast accomplish, under an auditor’s direction, departure from the body. During processing itis a good practice to have the thetan repair any nerve lines, or other matters which he finds tobe antipathetic to him in the body.37"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The rehabilitation of the thetan is up through the sub-zero range where beautifulsadness and degradation are the two concepts used, into the band of the plus scale wherebeauty and ugliness are used as the feeling.The feeling differs from the concept and one can have a feeling and a concept at thesame time.An individual who cannot get out of his body immediately can look around inside hishead and find the black spots and turn them white much in the same fashion.2The technique is simple, but it is most simple to an individual who has a thoroughcommand of the entire subject. The rehabilitation of the thetan consists of his being able tosever communications with the body at will, and consists of making it possible for the thetannot to have a collapsed tractor every time the body is hurt, plus snapping him into the body.Protection of the body, need of the body, the body getting credit, the feeling that onemust have identification, the beautiful sadness of bodies dying—are the various conceptswhich are used in this process.When the thetan is securely out of the body, he can look around him and find any areaof enturbulation, and do whatever he pleases about it. He can find vibrations and do what helikes with those.The sight of a thetan is very bad—as would be the sight of anything below the levelof death—for the MEST body, and the memory of the thetan for himself is extremely poor.These gradually rehabilitate until the thetan can perceive and recall as himself. Hisrehabilitation consists mainly of changing his own postulate, rather than running facsimiles.Wherever possible, avoid running any emotion or effort with the thetan beyondsympathy and those indicated above. These are low scale manifestations and will fall away.It is possible for the thetan to pick up whole packages of facsimiles and throw themaway at will.The test of this technique is that in from two to twenty-five hours of processing, anindividual can expect to be far above the level of MEST clear.The true knowingness and the true beingness of homo sapiens is his life source. Inalmost all persons to be processed, it will be discovered that this life source is in very poorcondition.If any difficulties are discovered in utilizing this process, it is recommended that onecontact an Associate School of the Hubbard Association of Scientologists.Care should be utilized in picking up the areas inside the body which have built-upenergy on them. This energy is actually the thetan’s own energy. It is in ridges. It hasindividualities because the ridges, being covered with facsimiles, seem to be able to think,and when they are pulled away too rapidly, terrible somatics can result. Some somatics can beexpected to result.A theta clear is one who can get in and out of his body at will. A cleared theta clear isone who has full recall of everything and full ability as a thetan.1 This fact was established by Evans W. Farber, Fellow of Scientology.2 E-therapists and others experimenting with internal awareness occasionally fellaccidentally into this manifestation.38"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"39"}]
