world made the publisher feel acknowledgedfor his efforts and encouraged him to proceed with issuing the present volume, “A Handbook forUse”.Not withstanding the controversial personality of L. Ron Hubbard who for a good fortyyears formed the target for Time Magazine attacks, and despite the allegations and insinuations ofself-styled “sect hunters” against the teachings of the founder of the scientology movement, thepublisher considered it unquestionably necessary to make the present materials available to thebroad public.Even some recently published English and American titles working on the principle thatHubbard had had nothing else in mind than to establish a system of manipulation and control,could not change the publisher’s decision, because he, having himself been a member of theChurch of Scientology in years past, had already come to his own conclusions, situated somewherein between these artificially constructed battlefronts.The present handbook, then, has come to be produced from the background of thepublisher’s dealing for over twenty years with friends and foes of this controversial movement. Theexperiences made in context with VAP’s publishing of the German version of “The Hidden Storyof Scientology”, by Omar V. Garrison, were of particular importance, as they clearly demonstratedhow far the Church of Scientology had deviated from Hubbard’s intentions. Particularly theirnoisily asserted claim to having a monopoly on Hubbard’s work appears to be utterly untenable,and unacceptable if looked at in the light of the freedom of science and religion anchored withinthe democratic constitutions of the western world.Himself a free thinker, in addressing his readers with a script like this, the publisher hassimply the intention to free the philosophy and methodology of Hubbard from their superfluousdead weight and to make them accessible to the general public. This is in the hope that thetechniques discussed here are put to an unprejudiced test so that an impartial judgment from theside of ordinary people is made possible, i.e. from those not indoctrinated by the Church ofScientology or its detractors.References are made throughout this book to other scientological materials, such asHubbard’s books and tapes or CofS publications. It would be convenient if all the materials neededin order to understand and use the whole of this subject could be included in this book. As thiswould make it unmanageable and present copyright difficulties, it has been decided to leave thereferences to the dictionaries and technical publications as stated, hoping that the context isnonetheless understandable and that for those readers keen to study further there is access to thesepublications. They can be ordered through book shops if one would rather not approach the CofSdirectly. If there should be any trouble with obtaining books and E-Meters, you are welcome to getin touch with the publisher."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10PART THREE:The Procedures."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"11Personal IntegrityWhat is true for you is what you have observed yourselfAnd when you lose that you have lost everything.What is personal integrity?

Ron Hubbard, in “Ability” No. 125,1961.)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12IntroductionIn this second volume on the subject of scientology, we are going to discuss the practicalapplication of the auditing theory which was the content of the first volume, particularly of PartTwo. It now goes on with Part Three and Four. Part Three describes the individual procedures“processes”) and their application; Part Four deals with Case Supervision, i.e. the analysis of acase on the basis of a previous interview, the working out of a program containing the proceduresexplained in Part Three, and the doing of the program.Auditing is the means of therapy used in scientology. As a word, it means “listening”,which signifies that the activity is based on the use of communication processes. It can be done onmany levels and isn’t restricted in its application to professional therapists. Also one doesn’t haveto have mastered the whole subject and have read every word Hubbard wrote (or indeed the wholeof this book) before one can do useful and beneficial work as an auditor.Part of this book is concerned with the use of the E-meter as an auditing aid, but valuableresults can be attained without it. (Witness the vast popularity of early dianetics in the 50’s, beforethe E-meter was developed. ) Some processes are designed to be used without the meter, othersrequire it. The following chapters have been arranged accordingly. For those who wish to auditwithout an E-meter, the chapters on “Simple Techniques”, “Objective Processes” and “PostulateAuditing” are the ones to study. Beginning with the chapter on “Auditing with the E-meter” thereis an increasingly professional slant.Whether you use a meter or do without, all procedures need to be drilled well before yougo into a real auditing session. Drilling is an essential part of the auditor’s training. The time-honored rule is “read it - drill it - do it”. One of the proven aspects of scientology practitionertraining is that you cannot expect to become an auditor just by reading about it. Your certaintyregarding the various procedures, your routine in handling the E-meter and your auditor presencecan only be achieved by drilling, drilling, drilling and doing, doing, doing. You need anexperienced auditor to train you. You cannot pick it up from a book, be it this one or any otherone.Your auditor presence in particular is the platform the pc’s trust in you rests on. If you werea “technician” only, your pc would soon feel lonely. There are moments when you have to bepersonally with him and help him through, on a direct thetan-to-thetan ARC line. This cannot besubstituted by any “technical procedures” . And it is not simply a matter of training either. Auditorpresence is the quality that underlies all real success in many fields, such as education or medicine,for example. It is an expression of genuine caring and ability to grant beingness to the other person.This natural willingness to respect the way others are, and to respond to a need for help, can beenhanced by training in communication skills, although this cannot be a substitute for it. Theimportance of good auditor presence particularly is that it allows the pc to feel safe and thus to havethe confidence to face up to what he couldn’t confront before. Hubbard recognized this importanceand was aware that an auditor becomes more effective as he progresses with his own case-handlingand becomes Clear himself.To some extent, though, auditor presence can be acquired and enhanced by means of anumber of drills called the “Training Routines” or “TRs”. They deal with the fundamental"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"13elements of communication. For this reason the first chapter is devoted to them. No matter whatyou do in auditing or in life, your TRs “have to be in” . This means as much as “your presencemust be unshakable” - be it as an auditor or as a private person.As in Volume 1, all words in bold print are technical terms and can be looked up in theTechnical Dictionary."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"14TheTraining Routines (TRs):Basic Elements OfCommunicationThe training routines or TRs are called this, because they ought to be drilled as a matter ofroutine. They are the back bone of any kind of auditor training. They are all done the same way: astudent, a coach; the drill is done with the coach correcting the student as needed, until the studenthas passed the drill; then their roles reverse.In the following text you will find that the actual drills are described rather briefly, whereastheir application to auditing is discussed more broadly. It would be beyond the scope of this bookto elaborate the full drilling instructions. However, they can be found in a compilation of Hubbardtexts, which despite its rather frightful name, is very useful: “The Volunteer Minister’s Handbook”[17]. (The name stems from a time when the CofS was very eagerly proclaiming its “religiousimage”.)The TRs are the most important tool the auditor has. Good TRs combined with keeping theAuditor’s Code are the fundamentals on which the tech rests. Any amount of technical processeswould be ineffective if used by an auditor who commits Code breaks - such as getting angry at thepc or giving comments and opinions on the pc’s statements - and who doesn’t have propercommand of the communication cycle . (See “Dangerous Auditor” in the Tech Dict.)TR-0: (Confronting)The actual drill: Student and coach sit opposite each other on twochairs and confront each other first with closed eyes and then with their eyes open. When they feelcomfortably here and now with their eyes closed, without being involved in thoughts or botheredby masses and pressures, they open their eyes; each when he is finished for himself. Then theycontinue with their eyes open. The emphasis of the drill is on attention and affinity alone. It ispassed when they can give each other flawless attention on the level of friendly interest, for at leasttwo hours.Then the newly acquired poise of calmly being able to face up to whatever it may be, is putto a test. The two partners divide up in coach and student, and the coach tries verbally andnonverbally to tease the student and make fun of him. This is called “bullbaiting”. When he doesnot manage to throw the student and when the student succeeds in keeping up his calm serenity,the drill is passed.The coach corrects the student concerning the training target by saying “flunk!” anytimethe student goes off the exact form, and carefully explaining to the student what he, the coach, hasobjectively observed. Then the coach goes through the same situation once again, so often till thestudent can take the hurdle easily. Only then will the coach present a new situation or increase thegradient of difficulty. He makes sure that the correct training gradient is kept and that there is nevermore than one button pushed. A “button” is an item stored in the reactive bank. When it gets“pushed” (restimulated) by the words, phrases or gestures of the coach, the student will react withdiscomfort, embarrassment, upset or uncontrollable laughter. A button is pushed repeatedly until it"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"15is flat. i.e. until the student has ceased reacting to it. Only then does the coach look for a new one.(As this training technique is used in all TRs, it will not be explained again.)The significance of the drill: With his TR-0 the auditor puts a safe mental space there. He isjust there, he isn’t doing anything but being there for and with the pc. He adds no unnecessarycomments and enturbulations. He is expected not to have a case. This means that he puts anothingness there, whereas the pc puts a big somethingness there: his case . This way the auditorforms a vacuum and the pc a high pressure area. Charge can now flow from the pc to the auditor.Good TR-0 has the effect that the pc just can’t help talking about his case. It’s being sucked out ofhim, as it were. - A bad auditor who can’t confront bank will act as a suppressor to the pc’sorigination’s. The pc will not wish to say very much to him.TR-1: (Controlled Outflow)The actual drill: Position as above. The student chooses aphrase or sentence in direct speech from a book, makes it his own and speaks it clearly and loudlyenough across to the other, as if it had just occurred to him. He must be very natural in doing so.The coach corrects him in the way described in TR-0 as criteria for his judgment he usesthe elements of the communication formula, the ARC-triangle and the tone scale . (As these criteriaare used as a means of training in all auditor drills, not only the TRs, there is no need to keep re-stating them.)The significance of the drill: TR-1 is the auditor’s mental and verbal reach into the pc’sbank. He is interested, he is curious (3.5 on the tonescale). He wants to get something done aboutit. He restimulates the pc by the auditing command, he invites him to look into the bank andthereby establishes the auditing comm cycle. A bad auditor will under-restimulate the pc, notreach him, bore him, and get nothing done.TR-2: (Acknowledgement of an Inflow) The actual drill: Position and procedure asabove, but with reversed roles. The coach speaks the sentences taken from the book across to thestudent who has to acknowledge them loudly, clearly, without any stuttering or communicationlags, and in a sensible way.The significance of the drill: TR-2 validates the pc for having found an answer to theauditor’s question. He has done what the auditor commanded, he has looked and searched and itwasn’t easy at all and now he has come up with an answer: he wants this validated.The auditor’s TR-2 acknowledges the pc’s efforts and results. This is not in order to benice, this is no hand-patting. The auditor has commanded the pc to enter the unknown jungle of hisbank and come out with a certain thing which the pc doesn’t quite know what it is going to be. Sothe pc goes into the jungle and comes out with something and doesn’t know yet if it is the rightthing. The auditor looks at what the pc found, estimates its value by meter reaction and pcindicators, sends him back when it isn’t good enough or validates him when it indeed is the realthing.A full acknowledgement is given when the auditor has fully understood the pc, and notbefore. It’s a sign of understanding and therefore composed of Communication and Reality andAffinity, in this sequence. The auditor has received the pc’s Communication. He acknowledges theReality of the pc in a way that makes the pc confident that the auditor did get it. Only then will thepc feel no further need to talk about the subject. The auditor as well must acknowledge the pc on"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"16the right tone level (Affinity): a half-tone above the pc’s tone. Then, and only then, will the pc feelunderstood . When the auditor is over-serious (“wooden TRs”) or lower toned than the pc, the pcwill never have a release as he won’t come uptone enough to get out of the bank. The auditortherefore takes up two positions on the tone scale simultaneously: that of interest (3.5) which henever leaves, and that one half tone above that of the pc. This is not to say that the auditor ispretending no, he just naturally goes along with the pc.The auditor “listens and computes” [2]. He does not just listen, take anything the pc maysay, and nod his head. He computes. He thinks. It is entirely up to his judgment how far he drivesthe pc into the bank, what he has him search for and for how long it is up to his estimation whetherwhat the pc found is within the context of the specific auditing command - fitting or not. He useshis own good sense. He most certainly does not break the Auditor’s Code [1] by invalidating thepc or making evaluative comments. And yet he computes, by giving his acknowledgement at theright point and for the right thing. His TR-2 controls the communication cycle - and it makes the pcfeel more certain.The pc’s uncertainty regarding the three universes is the only reason why he wantsauditing. He needs the auditor’s acknowledgement in order to build up the certainty he does nothave naturally. Good TR-2 encourages the pc to be fully certain; eventually he will create his owncertainty independent of the auditor or anyone. TR-2 is the vital factor in a session. Any sessionlives off it, no matter what method is being used.TR-3: (Persistence)The actual drill: The student asks the coach a simple question whichcan only be answered in a simple way, i.e. by “yes”, “no”, or “I don’t know”. Traditionally theinnocuous questions “Do fish swim?” and “Do birds fly?” are used. When the coach answers thequestion, the student acknowledges with a “thank you”. When he does not answer it, the studentleads back to the question with a “I repeat the question” or a similar phrase, and repeats thequestion verbatim in a friendly way as if it had never occurred before. This happens anytime thecoach does not answer. The coach tries with unexpected comments, similar to TR-0 bullbaited, tothrow the student off. The drill is passed when the student keeps up his persistence and gets ananswer under all circumstances.The significance of the drill: This TR trains the auditor to persist in asking his question untilthe pc comes up with the right answer, not a contrived one. The right answer is accompanied bymasses blowing off . A wrong answer is a mere “significance” [2] and has no mass connected toit. In this case the auditor sends the pc back into the jungle to look some more. He does his TR-3subtly and tactfully and imperceptibly and keeps the question going till he has the answer. Andthen - bang - here comes his TR-2 to end the cycle.TR-4: (Handling Misemotions and Unwillingness) The actual drill looks from theoutside like TR-3. There is a difference, though, in that the coach does not, as in TR-3, givenonsensical comments directed strictly at the student. but refers to himself, to his thoughts,misemotions, physical sensations and pains. He acts as if he couldn’t answer the question even ifhe wanted to, because he feels so bad. This drill requires a lot of authenticity from the coach. Muchas he is only pretending, he must be very true to himself in order to stay realistic. In such a situationthe student cannot just work with persistence as that would make the situation worse. He must beunderstanding, listen to the other, acknowledge him in his troubles and then gently and tactfullylead back to the question. Understanding, acknowledging, leading back to the question; that is the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17recipe for handling misemotion and unwillingness. The coach can increase the training gradient bypositioning his dramatization further and further down on the tonescale. The TR-4 of the student ischallenged the more, the “worse” the coach feels and the more strongly and thoroughly he acts theparticular mood out.The significance of the drill: It is the objective of TR-4 to reestablish the pc’s willingness tocooperate with the auditor and continue with the process .TR-4 is the auditor’s tool to help build upthe pc’s confront when he’s too scared of the bank to carry on. It doesn’t matter how the auditordoes it and how long it takes, as long as the pc is back in session. TR-4 is the most subtle of allTR’s as it entirely lives off the ARC of the auditor and nothing else.Going back for a moment to the importance of “auditor presence”: It is most obvious inTR-4, where the auditor has to show that he has really understood the pc, and in doing so, he, theauditor, is at his most visible. If he is not genuinely interested, his acknowledgment will stand outas false or inadequate, with the result that the pc will cease to feel safe, will lose trust, and theauditing session will fail to some degree. It is no surprise that TR-4 is the most difficult for some tolearn to do really well. The auditor’s interest in the pc is as important as the pc’s interest in hisbank.TRs 5-9: (Developing and Upholding Intention) TRs 5-9 teach the auditor to have justthe right amount of intention to get the job done; they teach him session control. Without awillingness to control, the auditor’s TRs 1-4 will collapse as soon as the going gets rough insession. Or, should he assume too much control, the pc will feel overwhelmed.If you would wish to develop a professional standard of skill as an auditor, you would bewell advised to spend considerable time on these basic drills, and that may amount to as much asthree to six weeks, ten hours a day - such is the value and importance of the TRs. (This is true forsolo-auditors too. Their success in session is equally dependent on their TRs. )"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"18Auditor And Pc- An IntroductionTHE SESSION IN PRACTICEHaving already covered the theoretical aspects of auditing in Part One and Two of the firstvolume, a more practical description of it follows now: The auditor asks the pc a set of questions ordirects him to examine some previously unviewed aspect of himself or his past. This is continueduntil the pc has gained some certainty on the underlying cause of his troubles, realizing “it is a . ..”. He has done what is called an itsa. He has had a cognition. When you make the mistake ofcarrying on beyond this point, you get an overrun. But never mind, it can be rehabilitated later.(See the appropriate section in this book.)To the extent that the process, i.e. the set of questions, is specifically relevant to the pc (andthis is carefully determined first), the achievement of his cognition will be accompanied by relief,brightening up, and various other “very good indicators” (VGIs), that together amount to the EndPhenomena (EP), of the process.THE AUDITOR’S CODEFurther on in this text we will describe the various tasks the auditor has to fulfill, in detail.(See “The Many Roles Of The Auditor”.) At this point only the most fundamental needs stating:The auditor has his auditing commands and his TRs. He does no more than putting the pc insession (TR-0), giving the auditing command (TR-1), acknowledging the pc’s answer (TR-2), andgetting the pc back to the auditing command when he wanders off (TR-3, TR-4). Further than that,the auditor does not talk. His behavior is wholly determined by the Auditor’s Code [1]. There isnothing ritualistic or artificial about this code. It provides a frame of reference for the auditor’sbehavior which he is obliged to adhere to, as otherwise the session would come to a bad end.When it is violated, wins and results cannot be guaranteed. It is a strictly functional code, with theexception of some “political” points (24-28) which have no bearing on the actual session.There is one aspect of the pc-auditor interrelation expressed in point 16 of the Auditor’sCode, which deserves mentioning in particular: “I promise to maintain Communication with thepreclear (. . .)”. This does not only refer to the actual session itself. Because out of session, the PCusually has a lot of questions about the auditing, about the session, about the tech, about the E-meter. Of course, you should never allow the pc to “talk case” out of session as it would only leadto over-restimulation. But apart from that, he will want to know what you are doing technically.Answer all his questions. Sometimes LRH-references help, but usually it’s you who has to do theexplaining. There is nothing worse than a tight-lipped auditor, who for fear of invalidating the pcor evaluating for him (which would be a violation of the code, indeed), turns the whole why andwherefore of the session into a huge secret. He doesn’t even do himself a favor that way, becausehe keeps the pc stupid. How on Earth is he going to audit a pc who is down on his knees with aweof the auditor, admiration of the session and respect for the authority of L. Ron Hubbard, but doesnot understand a thing of what’s happening to him? The whole session will become a ritual, aceremony, where the pc says what he thinks the auditor may want to hear at this or that point of theprocedure. So please answer all questions. When you answer them technically, as a general matter,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"19and not with respect to the pc’s own case, there will be no invalidation or evaluation, and you willnot introvert him at all. Quite the contrary: he will be a better team partner, because by giving himsome knowledge, you have increased his KRC-level. And a good team partner makes work everso easy.In the CofS, one is warned against giving “verbal tech”, which is sensible if it preventsmisrepresentation of the concepts. However, if you understand these ideas well enough to workwith them as an auditor, you surely can explain them adequately to your pc, and can recognizewhen you need to refer to LRH materials. (See “Code of a Scientologist, points 2,14,17 in [1].)THE AUDITING COMMUNICATION CYCLEIn the actual session, the auditing comm cycle [2] goes on between auditor and pc. Itsquality and smoothness is wholly determined by the auditor’s TRs. In slightly abbreviated form, itruns like this: 1. Is the pc ready to receive the command? 2. The auditor gives his command. 3. Thepc looks to his bank for an answer. 4. The pc receives an answer from the bank. 5. The pc givesthis answer to the auditor. 6. The auditor acknowledges the pc. 7. He makes sure theacknowledgment has been received by the pc. Now the next cycle starts with 1. again.MASS AND SIGNIFICANCEAlthough it may sound all too obvious, the following must be stated at some point, so hereit is: The pc must say out loud and in detail what comes to his mind .When he only thinks it, or says “yes” as an answer to the auditing command, he will notget rid of any charge. Quite the contrary: he will increase it! Each thing that comes to his mind withreference to the auditing question and stays un-communicated, will blow up the tension. “Haveyou ever had an operation?” Pc goes pale and says: “Yes, but I can’t tell you about it, it was tooterrible.” Now, when the auditor goes on to the next question, what help would that be to the pc?A button has been restimulated, and it must be cleaned before you go on. The pc must recreate thewhole incident in his mind (lst universe), and as he goes along doing so, he must create it for real(3rd universe). too, by describing all the sordid details to the auditor. Only then can an as-isnessoccur. The mental creation, the mental image picture of the incident must be a perfect duplicate ofthe actual incident, complete with time, place, form, event and exact postulate and the descriptionthe pc gives to the auditor must be a perfect duplicate of what he sees in his mind, and only thenwill they all discharge into each other and it goes poof! and nothing is left.Axiom 12. “The primary condition of any universe is that two spaces, energies, or objectsmust not occupy the same space. When this condition is violated (perfect duplicate) the apparencyof any universe or any part thereof is nulled.”The pc must create the mass of the incident, the emotional energy, the pain, the physicalsensation, he must sweat and pant and weep in session only then has he got any value out of it.When he merely says: “Well, I know what happened, it was like so-and-so and bla-di-bla, and thatreminds me that I had a similar cognition only the other week as I was picking some daffodils”, heis indulging in significance’s. That is not going to get him anywhere. Confronting significance’s"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"20leads to nothing but theta cosmetics. Confronting masses - that’s the hard part. And it’s up to theauditor to get the pc there. If he could do it alone, he wouldn’t need an auditor.TRUSTThe pc puts a lot of trust in his auditor. Therefore the auditor has to behave accordingly. ‘Apc tends to be able to confront to the degree that he or she feels safe. (. . .) If the auditors TRs arerough and his manner uncertain or challenging, evaluative or invalidative, the pcs confront isreduced to zero or worse. This comes from a very early set of laws (. . .):Auditor plus pc is greater than the bank, Auditor plus bank is greater than the pc, Pcminus auditor is less than the bank.No “bedside manner” is required or sympathetic expression. It’s just that an auditor whoknows his procedures and has good TRs inspires more confidence.” (From HCOB 30 April1969, “Auditor Trust” .)WHO TO AUDIT?Who should you accept as your pc? -This is entirely up to the type of work you want to doas an auditor. You may wish to help suicide cases, druggies and others who really got under thewheels. That’s fine, you may do so of course. Yet Hubbard’s motto is “to make the able moreable”. You will save yourself a lot of trouble when you stick to his words. Start with the easy ones,keep the rough cases till later. And it’s a sane viewpoint on the third dynamic, too: able people arelikely to create more positive change with broader influence on society than unable ones. Oncescientology is as widely accepted as medicine or psychology and subsidized by the governmentand insurance companies, auditors will be able to afford looking after drug addicts, criminals, andthe socially or mentally handicapped, in the institutions already set up for this purpose.But no matter whom you may wish to accept: be very sure he sincerely desires to get better,and is willing to do something about it! He must be in “need of change”, which is -4 on the Scaleof Awareness Characteristics [1]. (This scale reaches from -34, where the being considers himselfto be in a state of unexistence, to +21, where he realizes himself to be the sole source of his successand failure in life.)EXCHANGELastly, a word should be said on the subject of exchange. It is customary that the auditorgets paid by the pc. He gets paid by the hour. He does not get paid by the final result. It isimportant that one understands the significance of this. What does the auditor do? He gives his timeand his know-how to assist the pc in solving his problems. The actual solving, however, is done bythe pc! The auditor supervises the pc’s attempts to free himself and suggests new and better waysof doing it, by selecting the right auditing process. The pc does the work. And the pc agrees withthe auditor regarding the strategies the auditor has chosen.Speaking in comparison, it is like the pc wished to be taken to the other shore and needed aferryman. The ferryman can guarantee in principal that the destination will be reached, but he"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"21cannot guarantee that the pc is going to stand it financially and physically. Because it is the pc whois doing the rowing. Not the ferryman! He gets paid for his knowledge being used. And the longerit takes, the more expensive it is going to be. (This is actually being handled in the same way in thewhole field of therapy, not only in scientology.)So there is a contract: the auditor gives the pc something the pc considers valuable, and thepc pays the auditor according to the fee set. When the pc permits himself to get audited withoutfeeling that it is valuable, and still pays the auditor for it, he is himself to blame.This comes down to two simple business guidelines, one for the pc, the other for theauditor: The pc should be sincere with himself. He should discontinue the auditing when he getsthe feeling that it does not do anything for him. He should not go on, hoping it was going to getbetter, and then complain that he was cheated. What he does with his money is his ownresponsibility. The auditor, on the other hand, should not promise what he cannot keep. He shouldpromise results regarding spiritual abilities, yes, such as going Clear. When he feels competentenough, he may even say to the pc: “Your fear of spiders - well, auditing can handle that!”Because it does. So he may promise a result concerning a specific trouble the pc has, certainly, buthe should never say how long it will take ! All sorts of things may turn up in the attempt to handlethis one particular thing, and so it may take five times longer than expected.And again: auditing serves to increase the spiritual awareness of a person, his tone level,and his ability to handle his life causatively. It does not exclusively serve to undo someone’s fear ofspiders. It has a much broader scope than that. It does often achieve miracles, no doubt, but theyare not necessarily made to order. “I promise not to advocate Scientology only to cure illness oronly to treat the insane, knowing well it was intended for spiritual gain. “ (Auditor’s Code, point25 . )"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"22The Auditor’s Tools:A)Simple TechniquesThe simple techniques covered in this section may well serve as “introductory auditing”.This is recommended in some cases, because it seems more “natural” to some people than meteredauditing. To a beginning pc a controlled cycle of action from “This is the session” to “End ofsession”, a tightly held communication line, a specific auditing command meant to be answered,are enough of a novelty to make him wonder. Adding E-meter and cans as well may just be toomuch to take, at the start.For the beginning auditor, introductory auditing provides an easy gradient to make him feelat home with session procedure, pc reactions, keeping session control, etc.ASSISTSAssists serve as a mental first aid when the pc is in a state of shock and pain right after theaccident happened (Contact Assist), as a relief from confusion (Locational Assist) orpsychosomatic tension (Touch Assist). They reduce the unconsciousness produced by the shock ofthe accident, and they help to undo counter-postulates made during it.For children they work fabulously well. Instead of pitying the child, or scolding him for his“stupidity”, the caring parent would do an assist, make the child conscious of what has happened,make him confront the accident and the pain - and miraculously the shock will disappear. It is agreat way of helping children to be more responsible for their actions and keeping them frombuilding up “Service Facsimiles” in the attempt to control adults by means of tantrums and tearfulfaces. (Service Facsimiles were explained in Volume 1, Part Two.)Assists require no prior auditor experience. Good TRs are very useful, though, as a well-controlled auditing communication cycle is of supreme importance: command - execution -acknowledgment (“thank you”) - next command - etc., until the end phenomenon sets in.In a Contact Assist the person is made to touch the exact spot on the object he has hit,using the exact body part with which he hit the object. For example, you have banged your headon the door: touch your head back in the same place. Ideally the whole body motion and positionshould be exactly duplicated. It is done many times. At first the shock and pain will become worse,then the pc feels relief. Whether this should be done before or after medical first aid, depends onthe situation. There is no set command. What counts is the exact duplication of the harmful incidentby acting it out precisely as it was, or, in the case of precluding a painful event such as a smallpoxinjection would be for a little child, playing it through beforehand as it is going to happen.In a Locational Assist the pc is made to touch things or to look at things until his confusiongoes and he is back in touch with his environment. This is done on people who are under theinfluence of shock, alcohol or drugs. - Commands: “Look at the (object)!” or: “Touch the(object)!” - Pc does it. - “Thank you!” This one repeats till the pc looks and feels better."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"23In a Touch Assist the tips of the pc’s toes and fingers are touched in a left-rightsymmetrical sequence. (Left thumb - right thumb - left forefinger - right forefinger - etc.) In thesame way, going upwards, one touches points alongside his spine (the width of one hand away oneither side) and around the crown of his head. Then one works one’s way down along the sameroute and starts all over again. Usually one does it about a dozen times before any betterment canbe expected. The pc keeps his eyes closed all the while.A Touch Assist must be done for a long time and for some consecutive days, to have agood and lasting result. It relieves chronic or acute somatics, colds, headaches, etc. It can havequite startling results not necessarily to be expected from such a simple procedure. - Commands:“Feel my finger!” - Pc: “Hm” . _ “Thank you!” - And so on. (See the “Volunteer Minister’sHandbook” [17] .)”BOOK ONE” AUDITINGBook One auditing is the application of the techniques presented in the first of Hubbard’sbooks, “Dianetics, Modern Science of Mental Health”. This approach to the case is excellent forthe person who arrives at your door in a state of great need or distress, as it goes right down to thesource of his troubles without any need of prior instruction. It is a technique all by itself. Itdemands a special training course and appropriate experience in order to be done well. Quite incontrast to the rumors about it, Book One auditing is not easy. Certainly, one can be fairly sure tocause an impressive effect on someone by hitting on prenatal incidents or past lives even in his firstsession. Or by undoing a chronic disability or a psychosomatic illness. In that sense it is a “simpletechnique”, can be used as such, and is rightfully mentioned as part of this particular chapter. Butthat does not mean by far that one would be handling the case as a whole! That is just interesting,exciting, “oh wow!”, etc. Doing something for the pc consistently by means of raw Dianetics-book auditing, handling his case bit by bit, taking him up to Clear, is immensely difficult. Whenyou can do it, you have earned yourself the master’s degree. If done well, it’s the cream of allauditing . Why? Because you use no meter to tell you where the charge is and which way to go.You only rely on your observation and your judgment. Why did Hubbard invent all the othertechniques? Because Book One is so dreadfully complex. Everything else is comparativelystraightforward. Everything else added up and used right by instinct and intuition with no meter,would amount to what “Dianetics” demands of the auditor.This is not to discourage anyone it is just to explain why Book One auditing cannot becovered here . Anyone wishing to work with this technique is referred to DMSMH, Science ofSurvival and the very helpful bulletin “Standard Procedure” in Tech Vol.I, p.15.SELF ANALYSISThis type of auditing is extremely simple, good fun and surprisingly effective. It takes itsname from a book called “Self Analysis” (published 1951) which provides a number of listscontaining some 30 to 60 auditing questions each. Each question asks the pc to recall a certainincident, some of them pleasurable, some lightly unpleasant."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"24Self Analysis processes may appear too simple to be bothered with. They are not . Theybuild up recall and confront ability and teach the pc to create a timetrack by finding earlier similarincidents. Running Self Analysis Lists usually is a very rewarding experience for both the auditorand the pc . This is particularly true for List 1, Pleasure Moments. To give an example of thecommand sequence and a few items: “Recall a time when you were happy.” Pc does so and tellsthe auditor briefly about it. Then: “Recall an earlier time when you were happy.” Pc does so.Then: “Recall the earliest time you can when you were happy.” Pc does so . This would completeone command cycle . The same sequence is used for the other items on the list, such as “when youfinished constructing something”, “when life was cheerful”, when you ate something good”,“when you were kissed by someone you liked”, and further questions.Additionally, one asks the pc for specific sense perceptions such as sight, sound, color andmotion. On each command cycle one particular perception is used, on the next command cycleanother one, and so on.SESSION “ADMIN”“Admin”, derived from the word “administration”, simply means “the paperworkconnected with a session”.The session with simple techniques has the same form that is being used generally: 1.”Thisis the session!” 2.The process is run to a win or to an EP. 3.”End of session!”. In contrast tosessions with the E-meter, the auditor is not expected to write during the session. He writes hissummary session report afterwards or in a break. It contains for each process when it was startedand when it was ended, indicators of the pc during the process, and his origination’s andcognition’s. On a separate sheet which is stapled on top of the summary report, you add yourcomments and your suggestions for the next session, usually no more than “carry on with theprocess to EP”, or: “next process” - depending on how far you got with the pc. This is all theadmin you need to do. (In metered auditing there is more of it.)EMPHASIS ON TRAININGOnce the new pc has had a few sessions and a few wins he will feel at home with this newprocedure of auditing. He should now do a TRs-course to increase his confront. As well he shouldclear some basic technical and philosophical concepts as covered in Part Two of the previousvolume. This balance of auditing and training will increase his knowledge, responsibility andcontrol (KRC) regarding the handling of his case. The pc must understand that he has not come toa party of “beautiful people” who have nothing better to do than patting his hands, but to a placewhere he can learn to help himself . “Be cause ! “ is the motto."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"25The Auditor’s Tools:B) Objective ProcessesGENERAL DESCRIPTIONAuditing processes which make the pc look at his timetrack and his mental image pictures,are called subjective processes. In contrast to that, when he is running objective processes, the pcis asked to look at or do something with the actual objects in his environment . The command tolook at or do something with the object in question is not given only once but repeatedly. It’s arepetitive process. This way, restimulation occurs.An example: pc and auditor sit on two chairs opposite each other with the auditor’s kneesclosing the pc’s knees in. Their hands rest on their (own) thighs. The auditor says: “Give me thathand” . Pc gives the auditor his right hand. The auditor says “Thank you” and uses his left hand toput the pc’s right hand gently back on his thigh and repeats the whole cycle. The commands aregiven very fast and at a fairly even speed. This is run for some hours. (This process is called “CCH1”.)The pc will display all sorts of mechanisms and mental circuits. He will go down the tonescaleand up again, he may go unconscious (deep sleep) and wake up again, until finally the EP occurs.It is simply: no further restimulation possible. The pc does the process with enthusiasm and has noattention on time at all. He could continue it for hours without any effort.Another example of an objective process is Opening Procedure by Duplication. It goes likethis: Pc and auditor walk up and down between two tables or chairs on one of them there is abook, on the other a bottle. Commands: “Look at that book!” - pc looks - “Thank you ! “ - “Walkover to it ! “ - they walk over - “Thank you!” - “Pick it up!” - pc does - “Thank you!” “What’sit’s color?”/”What’s it’s temperature?”/”What’s it’s weight?” - pc answers each time as truthfullyas he can and auditor acknowledges each time with a “Thank you!” - “Put it down in exactly thesame place!” - “Thank you!” - “Look at that bottle!” - etc. Again, this is done for hours. The pcwill try to stay in present time but will invariably doze off. The most marvelous phenomena willoccur until the pc- after ten, thirty or fifty hours, spread out over a number of sessions - has run outall disagreements with monotonous and nonsensical activities and can do it as brightly as themorning sun without any attention on a time limit at all. He will feel that there won’t be anything toirritate him further in doing this particular activity, that there won’t be anything left in his bankwhich might get stirred up to distract him. Now he is “through” the process. -Transferring thisresult to life, one would expect that the pc, regarding his various activities, does not get sidetrackedby his bank any longer.Apart from the few processes mentioned here as examples, there are quite a lot more. Onecould put them in three categories:First: Processes based on the principle of Reach and Withdraw. They follow the simplepattern: “Touch the (object) ! “ - “Thank you!” - “Let go of the (object)!” - “Thank you!” - Etc.(As well, depending on circumstances: “Look at the (object)!” “Thank you!” - “Look away!” -“Thank you!” - Etc.) Used with reference to objects, places or people the pc has troubleconfronting (as manifested by shyness, repulsion, panic, etc.), they will turn on his symptoms quite"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"26vehemently to start with. Later the reaction will subside and vanish, to be replaced by positiverealizations.Second: Processes which “crack” the case, such as the ones mentioned, i.e. CCH 1 andOpening Procedure By Duplication.Third: Processes serving to increase one’s range of ability and awareness. They are inactual fact to be classed as learning processes. They are run in the repetitive style as well, but incontrast to the previous category, in a very considerate and observant manner. (There will be someexamples of them in the course of the text.)In auditing objectives you will see the pc going foggy, having misemotions, sensations andsomatics. How come objectives can restimulate bank? After all, the reactive mind consists of locks,secondaries, engrams, of masses and significance’s (postulates) - how can you get it restimulatedby having the pc repeatedly touch that wall, let go of that wall, touch that wall, let go of that wall;over and over and over again? (This would be an example of a Reach and withdraw process firstcategory above.)It is not necessarily the case that the object used in the process (i.e. the wall, the auditor’shand, the book, the bottle) is acting as a restimulator. The incidents restimulated may not containany of these things. So how come there can be a key-in? The secret lies in the repetitiveness of theaction. It’s the repetitiveness itself which causes the restimulation!With objectives you are addressing circuits. All engrams contain circuits. That’s becauseall engrams contain 2nd postulates: either someone said something and the pc picked it up andagreed to it, or - even if nobody said anything in the whole incident - he made a succumb-postulatehimself. These postulates go unconsciously round and round “in the pc’s head” like a circuit, anddetermine his behavior.The constant repetition of the auditing command in an objective process restimulates thesecircuits. The auditor acts exactly as the circuit does: he keeps repeating the same command. (Asthese mental circuits keep going continually, they are also called automaticities.) All 2ndpostulates follow the pattern of: “I don’t want to do it any more; I won’t do it any more; I can’t doit any more. ”This is exactly what is being restimulated by the continuously repeated auditingcommand - plus the interconnected engrams and GPMs with all their misemotions and pains.Now that we know how restimulation occurs (by repetition) and what is being restimulated(2nd postulates), we may ask what is the difference compared to subjective processes. There aswell you have the repetitive style there as well you are dealing with postulates. So what is specialabout the objectives? It is that they approach the case from the angle of control. Each thetan lovesto be in control; he likes to be at cause over his outflow of particles, i.e. over his communication.To him, outflow is nobler than inflow.Now, when he encounters a stop, when an intention is stronger than his and an obstaclebigger than him, when his body gets smashed - there he is being controlled, there he must permitthe inflow despite his attempts to control it. Therefore he musters all his strength in order to controlthe overwhelming power, puts energies, masses and postulates against it. But, when he does notundo these energies, masses and postulates after the danger has passed, they remain in the form ofa ridge, of a circuit . With the result that the circuit starts controlling the thetan himself firstly,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"27because it is unconscious, and secondly, restimulatable. The situation of then is “forever now” - assoon as it is restimulated. The thetan reacts to what he himself has created. He controlscompulsively.By giving the same command repetitively the auditor takes control of the pc’s actions andat the same time asks him to take over and run his own control. This of course gets the pc inconflict with his circuits. By trying to take control himself, the pc restimulates all the circuits towhich he has delegated his control. As a result, the circuits start playing up and in turn control him.It’s the old principle of getting the thetan to consciously do what he is already doing reactively -which invariably leads to introversion. (See also “Mimicry”, Tech Dict.) So the processes used areconvenient ways to address this tendency, with only general significance in the choice of subjects.One can certainly devise processes using pc-specific objects in certain cases. Reach-and Withdrawprocesses are very adaptable in this respect.A DIGRESSION ON HYPNOSISTo get another angle on this, consider hypnotism. That suggestible people are manipulatedis the basis of the main criticism of scientology, so this might be an opportunity to clarify this point.How does hypnosis work? The subject, at the insistence of the hypnotist, enters an unquestioningstate of mind and gives over control to him, at a deep or shallow level. He will behave ascommanded. Even afterwards, awakened, he will still execute “post-hypnotic commands”, i.e.commands given during the trance to be executed after it is over. The state of mind where thesecommands persist, unsuspected and unviewed, is exactly what you would call “bank” inscientology. If force or pain. especially when sufficient to cause heavy unconsciousness - as in anengram or a GPM - prevent review and discharge of the commands, then they will continue tooperate.In hypnotherapy the suggestions of the hypnotist are designed to override the negativesuccumb-postulates with positive ones, which may happen to appear similar to the original 1stpostulates. This can of course be somewhat effective, though without removing the underlying 2ndpostulates the results are unlikely to be lasting. (The same could be said in criticism of what iscalled “positive thinking”.)Life can be hypnotic. Life situations can force the person to abandon his own consciouscontrol and agree with the commands of the situation, the environment, other people or entities. Hechanges his state of mind, against his will, and even it is only for an instant it can afterwards actback on him, just like the post-hypnotic suggestion.An individual who has been heavily oppressed by life - and undoubtedly scientology doesattract such people - is likely to be easily hypnotized, as he may be in an almost continuous lighttrance anyway, imposed on him by external forces. So can be readily manipulated or takenadvantage of. Unfortunately such has happened in the CofS, though not necessarily from evil-intentionedness - which is the accusation. It is simply a shared group dramatization which people inall walks of life are susceptible to. Objective processes in the manner described here, undo all theseinstants, heavy or light, without the need to identify specific incidents. They run them out byrestimulating the outside control factor which the pc is identified with. The consequence is like anawakening and the pc becomes far less hypnotizable by life."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"28PROCEDUREThe introversion mentioned may go to the extreme of the pc being shaken by a fit of griefand tears, an anger tantrum, or by his losing consciousness partially or fully. Naturally, the auditordoesn’t allow his pc to get cowed back into agreement with his circuits but keeps giving thecommand - even to the point of bypassing the thetan and moving his body around for him.Supported by the auditor, the pc starts fighting his circuits. They turn on heavier than usual andeither gradually or suddenly release all of their remaining components: unconsciousness, pain,misemotion - the sort of stuff one would expect to be contained in an engram. The pc dramatizesthem, usually without getting any pictures. Suddenly it goes wham! - and a whole big chunk ofmass just blows away.Do adjust your speed to that of the pc whilst he is dramatizing. Don’t continuemechanically like a robot! You would either slow him down or urge him on. Certainly, in order toget him into a dramatization, you must work evenly and steadily. But once he is in something, careand attentiveness must be applied. This is your non-verbal way to stay in communication with thepc and keep the ARC up. And another thing: let him talk when he wants to talk! Not only when hehas a final realization, but as well when he sees pictures or re-lives incidents of the past. This doesnot occur all too often with objective processes as the bank shows itself in the form of masses only.But when it happens: let him finish talking, acknowledge him, carry on. Do not cut him short - butdo not switch over to subjective auditing either, trying to continue the objective process as a recallprocess. What’s right here, is entirely a matter of tact and feeling. Very subtle. Technicallyspeaking: it’s your TR-4 which will save the situation.As you go along with your process, you will observe that the effects it produces grow lessand less. To start with, there will be heavy masses, later misemotions, finally “weird thoughts”which of course are 2nd postulates. The process is “running flat”.And then the EP will occur: the pc beams and thinks it is perfectly all right to continue theprocess forever.So what has happened here? -The pc who has initially resisted the inflowing control andcommunication from the auditor and from his GPMs, can now tolerate them and permit them to“pass through him” . Instead of fighting them, he can have them. His Havingness has come up inboth senses of the definition: as “ARC with a something-ness”, i.e. the environment which he nowperceives with greater clarity and friendliness than ever before; and as “ARC with a nothing-ness”, i.e. the absence of circuits in the bank. He can have it that there is nothing where just beforethere still was something, and he does not feel insecure because of it. The bank - at least the sectionrestimulated here - has no more power over him; his environment cannot find any more “buttons”on him to push.This development from control via communication to Havingness has lent its name to anumber of objective processes: they are called CCHs, from Control-Communication-Havingness.CCH 1, the process mentioned, is usually done in combination with CCH 2, 3 and 4. Here is thefull procedure of CCH 1-4:"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"29CCH 1: As described. Run it to a change (pc keys something in) and continue until the pcis back up to normal or better. When it seems to be flat from the start (no apparent change), do runit for about half an hour to ascertain that there really is no change. (It may go flat at any point onthe tone scale. When it goes flat below 3 .0, it is not the EP but just a momentary flat point . )Thengo to CCH 2.Experience shows that one should run CCH 1 at a given speed with a definite andunchanging rhythm in order to cause a restimulation, and then keep this speed until therestimulation ceases. Change of speed seems to play a role. The pc may not be affected at all whenyou do it fast, then you change to slow, and within seconds he slumbers away. Or vice versa.Therefore make sure to change your tempo occasionally, whenever things seem to be flat anduneventful. But don’t get jumpy! Run each tempo for at least 10 minutes before you change.CCH 2: Auditor and pc walk up and down between two opposing walls in a room.Commands: “Look at that wall!” - “Thank you!” -Walk over to that wall!” - “Thank you!” -“Touch that wall!” - “Thank you!” - “Turn around!” - “Thank you!” “Look at that wall!” -Andso on, from the begining. The theory regarding the mechanism of restimulation for CCH 2 is thesame as for CCH 1. Both are control processes of the category two mentioned above. CCH 2 islighter on the pc as it allows him more choices than CCH 1. Run it to a change and through it ifthere is no change, run it for at least 20 minutes just to make sure . Then go to CCH 3.CCH 3: Pc and auditor sit on two chairs opposite each other, like in CCH 1. The auditorholds out his hands shoulder-high, palms out to the pc; the pc does the same; their palms touchmidway between them. Commands: “I am going to do a motion with my right hand. You follow it.Then I’ll do the same motion with my left hand; this time you contribute to the motion, or evenlead it. This depends on how well you duplicated the first motion on the right hand side.” -Theauditor does a motion with his right hand, then with his left hand. The pc’s palms stay on his palmsall the while . Nothing is being said. Then he asks: “Did you follow the motion on the one side?Did you contribute to it on the other side?” - Depending on the pc’s answer he has to determinewhether he should repeat the same motion, make a simpler one or a more difficult one.This, as you see, is not a heavy control process, but a communication process. It is meant toenhance abilities and therefore belongs to category three above. Here the auditor does not rotelyrepeat the same command to check if it evokes masses, energies and unconsciousness in the pc;quite the contrary, he is in close communication with the pc, he sets a certain gradient of difficultyto see if the pc can do it and lowers or heightens his standards according to the pc’s performance.The auditor gives the command as much as is needed and in different ways; his main concern iskeeping a lively commline with the pc. It is all done in the spirit of team work.CCH 3 has to do with duplication and understanding. The pc has to duplicate andunderstand the motion shown to him by the auditor on the one side, in order to be able to repeat itby himself or even contribute to the repetition, on the other side. When the auditor transfers hisown motion from the right side to the left in order to repeat it there, this repetition is donesymmetrically. When he has done a motion to the right with his right hand, he will do the samemotion to the left with his left hand."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"30Gradients of difficulty are established by a) the number of corners, or changes, a motionhas; b) speed of the motion; c) distance between the hands of the two. (They don’t have to touchall the time.)The whole purpose is to make the pc feel certain, on a gradient of difficulty, concerning hisability to duplicate and repeat a particular motion. When the pc has a win on this gradient - whichpresupposes that he had to do some work on it - the auditor goes on to CCH 4.CCH 4: This process follows the same theory as CCH 3. It is a communication process;yet in contrast to CCH 3 it allows the pc more creative self-determinism. There is no set commandat all. Auditor and pc sit opposite each other as in CCH 3. The auditor has a book in his hand andmakes a motion with this book, a simple one to start with. The motion occurs on a vertical planemidway between auditor and pc. Then he hands the book to the pc and asks him to do the samemotion all by himself - not mirror-image-wise, but the same motion. Taking the viewpoint of thebook, the book must travel through the same space both times. Just as in CCH 3, the auditor hasthe determine the right gradient of difficulty, repeat the motion he just did until the pc hasduplicated and executed it well, lower or heighten his standards if it proved too difficult or too easyfor the pc. In both CCH 3 and 4 the auditor needs good observation and good judgment.The sort of restimulation likely to occur on CCH 3 and 4 is different from CCH 1 and 2.You are not going to see heavy masses and energies, but grief discharges, general misemotions,and realizations about suppressive teaching strategies of parents and teachers. The whole subject of“learning through punishment” gets dragged up out of the depths of the pc’s mind.You will observe the pc going up the tonescale more and more as you progress from CCH1 to CCH 4. Each CCH will run shorter than the previous one; CCH 4 is quite often done for someminutes only. Now, with the pc all bright and shiny after CCH 4, the auditor says: “Now let’s seeif you can do CCH 1 with the same lightness and keep it all the way through.” -And now they areback to work.CCH 1-4 is considered one process, consisting of four parts . The EP, by the way, is onCCH 1, because of all the CCHs it is the hardest for keeping one’s spirits high without an effort.END PHENOMENONThere is the classical objectives EP of “pc going exterior”. This stems from the time whenHubbard was intensely attempting to make OTs - which did not work in this way, as we have seenin Volume 1. The experience does occur off and on, but is of very short duration only. Henceexteriorization cannot be considered a final EP but merely a nice experience - good enough to takea break. Look at the demands of life and work: one is expected to repeat the same actions daily,year in, year out; who cares if one goes exterior or not? Even if exterior one is expected to do one’sjob. They are not even giving you a break for it. Nobody wants to know if you happen to be insideor outside your body; what counts, are your products.For a thetan in good shape it is quite a normal thing to operate from an exterior viewpoint.Therefore, regarding our process, only one question is of importance: What happens when youcarry on after the break or the next day? Is the process flat (does it produce any more change) or"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"31not? Can the pc - exterior or not - execute the command for the length of time set, or does the bankget in his way?The senior EP to be had from objectives (beyond going exterior) therefore is ademonstration of competence: the pc can prove to the auditor that he is able to repeat the sameaction unlimitedly without getting bothered by any circuits, and can do so with full interest and inthe best of spirits - for the sole reason that he has decided to do so ! He is fully able and prepared torun something as “nonsensical” as “Give me that hand” for another 25 hours, just because it’sfun!As the pc is reaching his EP, his level of Havingness is so high that he can communicatewithout any reservations. Whether with a terminal or without, whether with sense or without - it isall the same to him. You may consider this a bit odd or even impossible - but if you think about it,little children do exactly that. They are constantly in the best of communication; with or without aterminal, with or without making sense. Although one could not take them as models for humanbehavior in general, they do serve as a good example for the concept of high Havingness.Given this EP it is obviously nonsense to “check CCHs on the meter” to see if the arecharged! You have to DO them with the pc for some hours before you can tell if they are flat ornot. And when he is through you can tell by his performance and his indicators. One doesn’t needan E-meter to see that.WHO NEEDS OBJECTIVES?Objective processes are described in the book ‘ Creation of Human Ability” [13] and inTech Vol.III, IVandV. At the time they were researched, they were thought to make peoplebecome Clear and OT, because they put the pc at control over his bank or made him go exterior.They probably served their purpose in some cases, but not in all of them. Therefore they came tobe reduced in importance and play a different role today. They are an excellent way of makingpeople find out what it means to have a bank, particularly those who are hung up in significance’s(empty words and meanings) and have lost the line to their own subjective certainty. You cannotrun such people on subjective recall processes because they won’t tell you what they feel is true butinstead try to ”figure out the right answer” . They cannot confront masses but only significance’s.They are afraid to experience things; they go on and on about their lives but don’t dive into thebrutal details of a peculiar occurrence. All of which means that they are not well in-session. Suchcases are “cracked” by objective processes, simply because they can’t predict what’s going tohappen in the course of the auditing. They cannot “figure out the EP”, as they might attempt to doin a subjective process.Another type of case may have a button on control. They resist being controlled orcompulsively control others and themselves. They have great benefits from objective processing.This is as well true for alcoholics and druggies, but again for a different reason: their ability tocontrol and communicate is so broken down that they’ll never find a line into the bank. By meansof objective processes they will begin to get in communication with their bank and with theenvironment as well."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"32Cases which are heavily out-of-valence respond well to CCH 1-4 in particular. Just get theidea that, with an out-of-valence case, you have not one person in front of you but several. The“chief thetan” is submerged by valences - which is why he cannot make decisions or finish cyclesof action. When you give the command, you are talking to a group of people, as it were . They willwork it out between themselves which way they are going to execute the command if they aregoing to do it at all. It may turn into quite a fight. In the end, the “chief thetan” - your pc - winsand is in control.Objectives may certainly be done on anyone, which is not to say that they bite oneveryone. There is nothing wrong with trying, though. Some cases respond extremely well tothem, others needing a different approach - just feel indifferent.A pc whose objectives aren’t in, is hard to audit subjectively as he tends to go effect of thebank. He cross-associates, pulls in bank, isn’t sure what’s real and what isn’t, thinks he’s imaginingit all, figures about the session after it’s over and gets into trouble, and so on. This is of no usewhen you audit subjective processes. There you want a pc who is in causative control over hisbank, who can look at one thing at a time, blow it, have a win; get the next bit restimulated, look atit, blow it, have a win, etc. Clean cycles of action. If he can’t do that, he’ll need an objectivesrundown.To finish off it should be mentioned that you have to be prepared for anything with regardto the duration of objective processes - on CCH 1-4 for example, anything between 15 and 150hours is possible. It takes as long as it takes.INSTRUCTIONS TO THE PCMake sure that the pc understands the concepts and the procedures of objective processesvery well, and that he is willing to do them. This is true for all auditing but even more so forobjectives as they don’t make sense at all at first glance - unless they are explained well. The pcwill not be in session as long as objective processes seem strange and peculiar to him.Clear the words and the concept of C-C-H (control-communication-havingness), and ofobjective versus subjective auditing. Then clarify the mechanics of restimulation brought about bythem. When the pc has understood the pertinent mechanisms you can tell him: “Now let’s see ifyou can run this process for half an hour without keying anything in”. -You will have his fullinterest and cooperation as the pc feels challenged personally such as he would in sports, forexample. Get him to agree to a “test stretch” for the EP. But don’t do it below half an hour. Thehigher you put it, the cleaner the pc will come out. But he may feel it’s overwhelming or unrealisticwhen you ask him to do it for two hours. Do it gradiently, step by step. There will be the pointwhen he knows with certainty that he could continue forever. That is the EP.(For reference, see BTB 30 Sept 1971 RA, “Model Session for CCH I-IV”; Ability Mag.34,“Havingness”, in Tech Vol.II; the booklet “Scientology Clear Procedure”, 1957; “Creation ofHuman Ability”; all entries on “objectives” and “CCHs” in the index of Tech Vol.X.)"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"33The Auditor's Tools:C) Postulate AuditingINTRODUCTIONIn subjective auditing, done by recalling incidents on the time track, the main target of theauditor is the well-aimed removal of 2nd postulates so that 1st postulates may be either executed orcanceled. This was explained in the philosophical discussion in Part Two. The life of man, orbetter, the games of a thetan, are determined by postulates. They, however, are not all his own.Foreign-made entities and the Genetic Entity put their pictures, charges and postulates into the headof the unaware thetan - and drive him “out of valence”. He takes on valences foreign to him; hisown valence is submerged.Postulate Auditing is a blend, a condensation, of various techniques Hubbard developedover the years (as the expert will immediately notice). They are going to be covered one after theother in detail. It is very safe to use for beginners and may take them a long way in handling thecases of their friends or family. The expert will find it provides a very smooth handling for his“rough cases”. It can be done without an E-meter and is presented here with that intention. Thosefamiliar with the E-meter may of course use it as the meter makes for precision and session speed.The procedure is the same. Remarks addressed to meter users may be ignored by others. (Thesewill be “F/N” and “TA”. They are explained in the chapter on the E-meter.)FINDING SOMETHING TO AUDITThe first thing one would have to do in auditing, is finding out what’s bothering the pc.What he tells you is called an item. Any item, to be auditable, must have the pc’s interest - and aread on the meter. Those two conditions must be fulfilled for a successful session to occur. Youdon’t audit items the pc isn’t interested in, or non-reading ones.An item is never just an observation of the environment. “It’s raining” is not an item (evenwhen it reads), not in this way of saying it. An item contains the emotional involvement of the pcin the way it’s stated and has the form of an Attitude, Emotion, Sensation or Pain (AESP). Sowhat’s wrong with rain? “Too much rain is unhealthy. “This is an item. It has the form of anattitude, i.e. a thought or postulate about life. Or: “It makes me sad”. This is an item because itcontains an emotion. Or: “When it rains I always get a foggy head” - a sensation. Or: “My bonesache when it rains” - a pain.An item does not have to be defined as narrowly as just described, though. After all, thereare often situations which one just generally feels unhappy about. To split them up in AESPswould not do them any justice. Examples would be: “the death of my grandmother”, “I lost myjob”, “my bronchitis”. When someone is full of pain and sorrow about his mishap, one shouldallow him first of all to just talk it through. Whilst he is talking one will see the complexity of thesituation fall apart, and single AESPs will emerge all by themselves. These one should note downand take them up later."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"34A valid item would always affect the pc as a misemotion, i.e. it would be stated at 2.0 onthe tonescale or below. All statements made below 2.0 indicate that a 2nd postulate has beenrestimulated. Rule of thumb: 1st postulate: reach, start of a game, above 2.0 on the tonescale. 2ndpostulate: withdraw, stop, below 2.0.THE TECHNIQUE OF LOCK-SCANNINGLock-scanning is the lightest way of entering a case. Skillfully applied, it will get the pcdown to the secondary, the engram. and finally the postulate. So lock-scanning may not onlyproduce a key-out but even a full erasure. As one is always working right in the pc’s center ofattention, he usually is super interested in the action and very much in session.Here is a brief sketch of this method: the pc is afraid of horses. Referring to the sectionabove, this would be a good example for a generally upsetting situation. It is not a very preciselydefined AESP-item. Never the less it is a valid one, because it is situated below 2.0 on thetonescale and the pc would like to do away with it. So to start with, the auditor asks him for theearliest time the pc can easily recall when he was afraid of horses, gets the answer and then has thepc recall all later times when he was afraid of horses, up to present time (PT). Then the auditorasks for the earliest time available now, gets the answer and again runs all later locks to PT. Andagain. And again. And again. Always the same procedure.On each run through the pc will drop some of the locks of the previous runs and come upwith new locks, or new details of locks already mentioned. Enturbulated theta is converted intofree theta. More attention units and more confront power are available for use. Consequentlymoments of heavier restimulation will appear, simply because the pc can confront them now. Hewill contact secondaries. More enturbulated theta is converted into free theta; confront powerincreases even more. Now, as you continue your lock-scanning, the thetan will “fall” into theengram. When all later locks and secondaries are cleaned off and the basic engram is left all byitself, the pc will be able to run it as easily as a cat lapping up warm milk.You always and unvaryingly stick to your earliest-to-PT routine. This applies to runningthe basic incident, too . You can immediately tell what the basic is: it’s one of the times the pc hasput a stop on his 1st postulate by making a 2nd postulate. This usually occurs in the context of anengram or an implant. Get the beginning the pc can find now, run through to its end, then scanlocks to PT. Go again to the basic, see if there is an earlier beginning in the incident, run the wholeincident through to its end, scan locks to PT. Soon the pc’s interest will be totally off the laterlocks; he’s now fully ready to use all of his free attention and confront the basic incident(engram/implant). Now you go earlier beginning-to-end, earlier-beginning-to-end, and again, andagain, till he has found the beginning of the incident. And alongwith this he will come up with the postulate which has kept the basic incident and thewhole chain in place. Technically speaking, the auditor changed from lock scanning to “narrativestyle”. The difference is that in lock-scanning a whole chain of incidents is run through (from itsearliest beginning to present time), whereas in narrative style it is only a single one. The pc“narrates” the content of this particular incident from its earliest beginning to its end."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"35During both the lock-scanning and the narrative part, the original, very generally wordeditem “fear of horses” will break up into various AESP-items. In context with the incidents the pctells, further attitudes, emotions, physical sensations and pains in context with horses will bementioned. When these utterances are accompanied by corresponding indicators and a read on themeter, the auditor must note them down. They will get taken up later one by one.NARRATIVE STYLEAs we just saw: the auditing procedure where you have the pc tell you an incident frombeginning to end, again and again and again, is called “narrative style”. It helps the pc to bringorder into the chaos of the incident. When he starts out he will just see a glimpse of it which maybe at its end or somewhere in the middle. By asking the pc to find the earliest possible beginningand to tell the whole story from there to the end, the auditor assists the pc to gradually raise hisconfront of the incident. Finally he will see it in all details. He may have to run it through twenty orthirty times, though! Each time through, known data won’t get mentioned again and new data, sofar unknown, will appear.There is one potential danger in narrative style: the pc may start narrating the incident “bymemory?’. He will start mocking it up again! This is not what you want. To avoid it, you mustexplain very clearly to the pc what he ought to do. It’s like he was watching a TV screen which theauditor can’t see. So the pc must tell the auditor what he sees on the screen, i.e. what he sees nowwhile the action is happening, not what he saw the last time through the incident. (What the pc“sees” is not limited to his visual impressions only, but refers to 54 further sense perceptics aswell! [1]) Only what he sees now is of importance. “I see a man. He walks into a room. From theleft; there is a door. He stops by the table. It’s dark and cold. I am afraid. Etc.” This way theauditor can tell how the pc is moving from the level of action to the levels of emotion andpostulate. He can see the shift of importance’s. And he can see how the incident is graduallyerasing and thus recognize when to stop. When the pc starts talking “about” the incident instead ofdescribing what he sees, he will be beginning to put something there where there is actuallynothing. This is a problem common to all thetans. It is so much easier to acknowledge that there issomething than to acknowledge that there is nothing! Failing to accept that there is nothing, the pcwill either put something there or pull in some other engram or picture, just so that he hassomething to talk about. But: this will go along with bad indicators, such as glumness, slowness,unavailability of data, and on the meter it will produce a sticky needle and finally a high and verystuck TA. Developing an awareness of when a process is complete, when the EP has beenreached, and so when to stop, is one of the vitally important points of learning to audit.FINDING THE POSTULATE IN THE INCIDENTThe pc will run through his incidents as described by a scale called “Points of CaseAddress” [1]. It goes (upwards): matter effort - emotion - reason - aesthetics. To start with, the pcwill be busy with the level of effort and counter-effort. He’ll be talking about matter, energy, space,time and action. When this goes flat and he goes through the incident again (and again and again),he picks out the emotions: that’s the next level up. After that has gone flat the auditor sends himthrough again (and again and again) and the decisions and postulates made during the incidentbecome available. There are several of them, usually, not just one. This is the level of “reason” on"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"36the scale. On this level the pc will encounter (amongst others) the crucial 2nd postulate, recognizeit for what it is and as-is it. That being done he’ll marvel at the whole incident, how it could havehappened to him, how he could have made such a postulate, how the events of the incidentinterrelate with the actions in his later life - he is moving up to the level of aesthetics. “Now isn’tthat something! Wow! Would you believe it!” Aesthetics. Admiration (Factors 14 and 29) - Now,the whole incident is erased.Not only in the basic incident but in locks as well, the pc will voice postulates. They havethe form of decisions regarding a state of being, doing or having. They describe precisely the statethe pc is habitually in. His chronic state of being, doing and having, both physically and mentally,is determined by the sum of his own postulates and decisions, no matter if they are sane oraberrated. Those voiced in context with a lock, secondary or engram are of course aberrated ones.They are usually worded in an imperative way. Examples: “I don’t know what they want!”; “Itdoesn’t work!”; “It can’t be!”; “I cut all my feelings off.”; “I’m happy it’s over.”; “I can’t reachit.”; “I just never manage . “; “It kills me” . They often go along with a startled expression or ablush on the pc’s face, with him suddenly getting agitated, assertive or possibly tearful - and with aread on the meter. The auditor must keep his ears open for such utterances and note them downverbatim as they come . They play a crucial role in really cleaning up the pc’s case when they arerun in the next step, by repeater technique.REPEATER TECHNIQUE AND HOW TO DEALWITH BASIC INCIDENTSA normal session would run like this: pc has a complaint. Its either an attitude, emotion,sensation or pain (AESP). Let us say he has a “burning sensation in the lungs”. This is followeddown the track by lock-scanning and narrative technique. The pc finds a beginning of hiscomplaint at the age of three and runs through all locks several times, until they get really “thin” .The auditor, every time he returns the pc to the beginning of the chain, makes sure to ask if there isan earlier beginning to this complaint. Suddenly a picture shows up which the pc can’t putanywhere in this lifetime. They follow it up and find out he was caught in a burning house,couldn’t get out and burnt to death. It was in 1651. The postulate found is: “I’m always thevictim”. The incident erases, the pc looks good and bright, on the meter there is an F/N.What is the auditor going to do when the pc does not “fall into the engram”? Take avariation of the example before: The complaint (burning sensation in the lungs) is traced down tochildhood. The pc is twelve years old, sits by the table and watches with terror as his parents havea bad fight. In the back there is a fire going in the fireplace. Nothing earlier, no engram.Lockscanning is done till all locks are erased; the basic incident (the fight) is gone through innarrative style; the pc voices the postulate: “I’m always the victim”. The incident erases, pc ishappy, F/N . This was not an engram . It was a heavy lock, at best a secondary (a moment whenthe pc felt threatened by a loss, i.e. that of his parents.)There is something foul here, obviously. How can a severe 2nd postulate be made undercircumstances not worse than a light secondary? Didn’t we learn that it takes a lot of force(engram/ implant) to stop a thetan sufficiently so that he makes a 2nd postulate? How does all thisfit in together? Answer: the engram we are looking for is not on the pc’s track, but on that of an"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"37entity. It was restimulated by the open fire in the fireplace which formed part of the fightingincident, and thereupon locked itself up with the pc. This was only possible, because the pc was -due to the quarrel between his parents - emotionally troubled and less alert than usual. Being downon the tonescale is the prerequisite for a key-in.In the first example above, the pc found a basic on his own track: 1651, the burning house.This is the moment the 2nd postulate was made, and it was made by himself. We know by theorythat there cannot be anything earlier than that, so it is an absolute basic. In the second example, thepc found a basic, too: the fight between the parents. As there was nothing earlier, it was - to thebest of the pc’s knowledge - a basic it could be erased. Yet it was a basic relative to the pcs trackonly! As the absolute basic must be an engram or an implant, but was not to be found on the pc’stime track in the second example, it must be on that of an entity. The restimulators prevalent duringthe quarrel between the pc’s parents caused this entity to awaken, connect up with the pc and pourits postulate over him. This is a relative basic. It doesn’t matter if this was the first time aconnection was made, or if it was an old connection with an entity which had been dormant in themeantime. Speaking in technical terms, it is simply a lock. In the first example, the absolute basicwas on the time track of the pc. In the second one, the relative basic was found on the pc’s timetrack, the absolute basic on that of an entity. When it cannot be found on the pc’s track it has to beon that of an entity there is no other option.This is proven by the phenomena one gets with repeater tech. It is applied after the basichas been found and erased, be it a relative or an absolute basic. The postulates voiced by the pc arerepeated by him, one after the other, in order to detect further incidents connected with them.“Repeater Technique: the repetition of a word or phrase in order to produce movement on thetime track into an entheta area containing that word or phrase. (. . .) Repetition of such a phrase,over and over sucks the patient back down the track and into contact with an engram whichcontains it” [2].Going back to example one, above: the auditor asks the pc to repeat “I’m always thevictim” over and over again and tell him all incidents which get washed into view this way. The pcwill find a few incidents on his own track when he used this postulate to make himself right in asituation, or to explain why he couldn’t cope with it. He gives them a fleeting glance and erasesthem. A clean-up action of ten minutes or so; all concerning his own time track.Now let’s look at example two: here as well the auditor asks the pc to repeat the postulate,but a lot more than in example one is caused: the absolute basic, on a different track than the pc’s,comes to view. It occurred in 1943 when a farmer burnt to his death in his barn. The pc knows thisbarn, still all black and ruined; he has seen it in his childhood. As he was born in 1944 he assumesthat he must have been this farmer in his past life . The session gets stickier and stickier the morethe pc finds out about this. The auditor asks him if this incident may possibly not be his own. Thepc feels immediate relief. The auditor gives only the minimally required explanations; the bulk ofthem he saves up till after the session. The pc has now acknowledged to himself that he was notthis farmer and that the action did not happen on his own track, and again the session goes assmooth as silk. The pc gets all details of the incident, finds the moment when the farmer made thepostulate of “Why is it always me?”, and the incident erases. Note that the wording of the actualpostulate found in the incident usually differs to some extent from the postulate the pc mentionedoriginally. Therefore care must be taken to get the exact postulate for each incident separately."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"38After this success the pc again repeats “I’m always the victim” and yet another incident iswashed up! This time it is that of a woman being burnt at the stake, in 1532. Again the pcrecognizes that it is not his own timetrack. After this incident is fully run the postulate of thewoman is found: “I’m a victim of my good faith”. Pc cognites that he always had trouble trustingpeople. Again the postulate “I’m always the victim” is repeated; this time to no result. Pc smilesand is certain that there is nothing left in connection with this postulate and that it actually has nofurther power over him. (F/N on the meter.)The pc reports after a few weeks that the burningsensation in his lungs has not occurred any more, and that he finds himself more self-confident andoutgoing in life.STICKY SESSIONSSometimes it happens that sessions get slow and sticky after a while . Typical phenomena:pc uncertain about the exact content of the incident, can’t move back and forth on the track, has astuck picture, sees nothing at all, starts seeing details which belong to other incidents, gets variousincidents mixed up with each other. On the meter this is accompanied by a TA rising high andfinally getting stuck.There are only four reasons for this: 1. The pc is working on an incident on his owntimetrack and has not confronted certain parts of it yet. 2. A similar incident is concurrently inrestimulation. It may be earlier or later on the timetrack. 3. An entity has been restimulated and isnot recognized as such. Auditor and pc still assume that the incident is on the pc’s track; but thisisn’t the case. It’s an incident on a different track. 4. Several entities are in restimulation at the sametime.The session will get going again as soon as the correct reason has been found (Fac. 28 andAx. 29). Handling for 1: When the pc cannot confront something it is advisable to run later similarincidents in order to reduce their charge and build up the confront power of the pc. Should there beno such incidents, there is no alternative to repeatedly running through the incident in question,until it has cleared up in all aspects. Handling for 2-4: Find the entities or incidents associated withthe incident you are running and run them out, then return to the incident you originally started outfrom. Simply ask the pc for the various possibilities, when you hit upon the right one, he willbrighten up immediately.STRIPPING VALENCESSituation: you have run your pc through an absolute basic on his own or someone else’strack, he finds his 2nd postulate - but has no full end phenomena. How come?Well, you ran it from the pc’s viewpoint only (if it happened on his own track), or from theviewpoint of the person to whom it happened (if it is from another’s track). Have the pc lookaround some more in the incident and you will find that he still has attention on some of the otherpeople involved. Have him additionally run the incident from the viewpoint of these people, oneby one; have him speak in the first person as if it had happened to him. Have him get each person’spostulate, too. This makes the pc go into that person’s valence knowingly. Doing so, he willdisconnect from his identification with that person; the valence will break off him. Its power over"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"39the pc could only exist as long as he went into the valence unknowingly. Strip one valence afterthe other off the pc. When the incident itself has been erased: run these valence postulates byrepeater tech also! It will make the pc clean up all the times he was out of valence in this regard.There will be a marvelous EP.SUMMARYThe basic idea of Postulate Auditing is to get straight down to the postulates which keepthe case together. Such postulates were already given a lot of attention in “Dianetics” . ThereHubbard asked the auditor to take mental notes of habitual utterances of the pc in or out of session,so as to get a key for “cracking his case”. Such utterances were termed “bouncers”, “denyers”(deny-ers), “misdirectors”, etc. in the Dianetics book. When they appear in session, the recall workdone up to this point usually comes to a halt. To give an example of a normal Book One session:the pc has found an engram and goes several times through it from beginning to end, until it isemptied of all details and its whole charge is deflated - which means it has been erased. (This is the“narrative style”.) In contrast, when a session comes to a standstill, it may look like this: the pcnarrates the contents of his engram and suddenly sees no more of it. He says: “There is nothingthere!” However, as he doesn’t look as if he were through with it but appears to be stuck in themiddle of an incident, the auditor assumes that this must be a ‘“denyer”. He has the pc repeat:“There is nothing there - there is nothing there - there is nothing there” - etc. All of a sudden the pcwill get a picture of the incident when the postulate “There is nothing there” was made. As soonas this incident is erased, he can return to the engram that was left open before, and erase it as well.Technically speaking, the auditor changed over from “narrative style” to “repeatertechnique”, so as to follow a postulate down to its point of origin. Narrative style and repeatertechnique are two of the sources for Postulate Auditing. Another is that of lock-scanning, takenfrom “Science of Survival”. In “Dianetics” one was trying to get as directly as possible to theengram causing the pc’s trouble. The auditor would straight forwardly ask for it. The earlier, thebetter. When one got an incident this way, one would reduce its charge by having the pc describeit, and then look for earlier similar incidents. One threw the pc in at the deep end, so to speak, andhad him wade in deeper and deeper. It could be quite a strain for him. Later, in “Science ofSurvival”, Hubbard revised and simplified this approach by having the pc run light moments ofrestimulation to begin with, moments when engrams “locked up” with the pc. Such moments werecalled “locks”. In contrast to engrams, these locks were not run earlier - earlier - earlier on thetimetrack, but always from the earliest lock one happened to have found, to present time. Only thenan earlier lock was looked for. This approach has the advantage of reducing all charge between thelock found and the present, before going earlier. Additionally, one never demands too much of thepc and he stays mentally and physically in good shape all along.Out of the combination of narrative style, repeater technique and lock-scanning, the fourmain parts of Postulate Auditing are derived:First part: You have the pc tell you what his difficulties are and get an item you can audit.Second part: You have the pc find the earliest beginning, the moment when his troublesreally started. This chain of incidents (from the earliest to the present) is run through by"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"40lockscanning till all later locks are erased and only the basic incident is left, usually an engram orimplant.Third part: This basic incident is repeatedly run through narrative style until there is nothingleft to say about it, until no further pictures are pressing in on the pc, until he can laugh about it.That is an erasure.Fourth part: All postulates the auditor took note of in the second and third part, are run withrepeater technique. In the process of this, incidents will come into view when the pc tried to“prove” that he was unable to cope. (This relates them to Service Facsimiles). As well foreign-made incidents of entities or the GE will show up. Whatever their origin, each is run through innarrative style to erasure. The pc will come to differentiate more and more with regard to correctauthorship, and correspondingly become “master in his own house”. In the end he may even goClear.Postulate Auditing is built around the concept that the incidents of the reactive mind arecross-referenced and interwoven by means of postulates. (See A = A = A.) Entities of anydescription can only connect up with the pc if he has already succumb postulates in operation. Byunconsciously using and habitually not-ising them, he creates mental mass, a chronic charge whichfree-floating entities can cling to. Which makes things worse, of course. Only by finding out whohas done what, by assigning correct authorship, can the knot be disentangled eventually (Ax. 29,Fac.28). In the final analysis, it is the pc’s own responsibility what sort of case and what size casehe has - and that he has one at all.The above reasoning explains why incidents found in the fourth part of the sequence (theauditing of postulates) are run by repeater technique instead of being followed up by going earliersimilar. (“Is there an earlier similar incident?”) It’s because repeater technique will bring up theexact incident that is ready to be “plucked” . The mass backing up the picture is produced by apostulate you already know - it’s the one you are working with. So you don’t have to go E/S(earlier similar), because you are not - in the attempt to find a 2nd postulate - looking for a basic.You have the postulate already. By repeating it you wave it about like a piece of fly paper to findout which bit of mass (both home-made and foreign-made) is going to stick to it. And when yougot one, you clean it up nicely and then you wave your fly paper about again, to see what else willto stick to it. And so on. After a while there won’t be any more bits of mass which are going torespond to that particular sort of fly paper, and you know the room is clean. No more flies of thatkind. And then you pull out your next bit of fly paper, the next postulate, and start the process allover again. You are never interested in earlier similar flies. You are only concerned with thatparticular fly that just got stuck to your paper.THE PROCEDURE STEP BY STEPFirst part: Finding an item.1. “What do you want handled?” “What is bothering you?” (The pc will answer witha generally worded item or a specific AESP-item)"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"41Second part: Scanning locks.2. “Recall the earliest time you can when you had (item)!” (Give the item exactly as itwas worded).3. “Tell me about it!” (Get as much time/place/form/event as the pc can give youeasily.)4. Instruction to the pc: “Tell me in the present tense as if you were reading it off aTV screen. Tell me all you can actually see or feel; no more, no less.” (Note: beforegiving the next command you may have to run through this particular incident afew times to reduce its charge if the pc demonstrates a lot of it. Cool it off first, thencarry on towards PT. )5. “Go to the next incident towards present time when you had (item) !”6. Repeat 5 until pc is back in PT. (Encourage him to tell only what comes easily tohim. No effort, please!)7. “Is there an earlier time when you had (item)?”8. Repeat 5 and 6. Instruct the pc: “Only tell me what’s on the screen now and do notadd what you know from before. Don’t put it there again by memory. Just alwaystell me what you see and feel now”.9. Repeat 7 and 8 until the pc has gone to the earliest time he can find. That is thebasic, the beginning of the chain.10. Make the pc clean up all later locks by repeatedly running from basic to PT. Eachtime he will get some more data out of the basic. Keep it effortless. Don’t ever pushhim into the basic. During the steps 2-10, do watch out for further AESPs the pcmay voice . They could be useful later on . Do not let it show in your behaviorwhen he has said one. Just make sure that you write it down verbatim (and with thecorresponding read on the meter.)Third part: Running the basic incident.11. With all later locks gone, the basic is now free for inspection. Take the pc through itfrom beginning to end. Ask him each time if it possibly began earlier, then take himthrough again from the new beginning. Sooner or later he will find the exactbeginning. (Only he knows that. He’ll brighten up when he has found it.)12. Have him go through the incident repeatedly until he has duplicated everything onthe level of effort and action. Then the incident is “flat”, i.e. there is no morechange. Be careful not to “plough the pc in” during these repetitions. Don’t havehim dig in, run him through. The hazy or peculiar bits will clear up as the pc goesthrough the incident a few more times. Just make sure that he gets each time as"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"42much time, place, form and event as is easily available. Don’t have him guess.Have him duplicate the incident.13. Now send the pc through on the level of emotion: “Now go through the incidentagain and tell me all the emotions you can pick up!” Give this command only whenthe pc has not come up with emotions all by himself. Have him run the incidentrepeatedly until it is flat regarding emotions.14. Now send him through on the level of thoughts, postulates, decisions. There will beseveral of them. “What decisions did you make during the incident; what thoughtsdid you have? “The 2nd postulate is the moment when the pc finally succumbed tothe counter-intentions against him. Ask him specifically for it only if he does notvolunteer the information. (Make a circle around each reading postulate, as you willcome back to it later.)15 . Find the exact wording of the 2nd postulate. When the pc has found it he will haveVGIs (and an F/N) . The incident will erase; the pc will not be interested in lookingat it further.Fourth part: Auditing postulates.16. Go through your worksheets and pick out all the postulates the pc has originated onhis way to the EP. Write them on a separate sheet of paper. This is your “postulatelist” .17. Explain to the pc that this step serves to restimulate and deactivate further incidents,in connection with the postulates he has voiced. Use repeater tech on the postulatewith the most charge (biggest read). Ask him to repeat the postulate a dozen times(or so) on his own. It will either bite and trigger some incidents, or go flat and F/N.(Do this step even if there is no read on calling out the postulate. Remember that itdid read when the pc mentioned it originally. You cannot be sure if it is as-isedunless you try heating it up by repeater technique.)18. Run each incident which comes up on a given postulate in narrative style, until it iserased. Some will erase at first glance, others will have to be run through a few (ormany) times. Do follow the pc here. Don’t make the incident more important than itis to him naturally, particularly when it is part of his present life and can be dealtwith in a few words. No pressure, please! Light incidents of the pc’s present lifeusually don’t F/N. The F/N generally occurs after a whole series of such lightincidents; or after a heavy incident has been worked through and erased - be it thepc’s or that of an entity.19. Keep using repeater tech on the same postulate until the pc knows with certaintythat there is absolutely nothing connected with this postulate any more . Thepostulate will F/N whilst the pc pronounces it! The pc will look very bright at thispoint. - On this step, many pc’s have great cognitions. They see how their life is"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"43determined by a network of postulates which they hang on like a puppet on itsstrings.20. Now go back to your list of postulates, take them up one by one in the sequence oftheir charged-ness (read size) and audit them with steps 17-19.21. Then go back to step 1 and start the whole cycle again by asking the pc for a newitem to work on. Or keep on working on the same item by taking up the AESPsincurred up to this point. Which decision you make, depends entirely on the pc’sinterest. When his “fear of horses” has been handled with a single run through thesteps 1-20 - marvelous. But when he is not quite so sure, you find your entry pointthrough the AESPs already mentioned. (The “A’s i.e. the attitudes, you haveactually handled already on the postulate-part of the sequence as all attitudes arebasically postulates . )Practical notes:To reduce an incident and finally erase it, you may have to run through it twenty to fortytimes. Don’t be impatient. It takes as long as it takes. Observe the pc. As long as he is coming upon the tonescale, everything is fine . When he is through, he will be genuinely cheerful. You’llknow it when you see it.Don’t get worried if each run through the incident brings up different data. It may changeconsiderably as the pc keeps repeating it! The final version may be very much unlike the firstversion. The explanation for this phenomenon is given in the “Scale of Confront” [1].On the fourth part, step 19: A dozen or more incidents may appear on a given postulate!Don’t worry: when there is nothing left there is nothing left, and the pc knows it. It is almostimpossible to overrun this.Each session you do will be different, but underlying each variation there is the pattern ofsteps 1-19. So stick to the steps as closely as you can, but be prepared to be flexible so as not toimpede the alive-ness of the session.SESSION BREAKS(This section addresses meter users in particular, but it is as well of general interest. It isabout F/Ns and when to interrupt sessions without any risk.)An F/N at session start is usually not a must in Postulate Auditing. Particularly in the firstsession, at step 1, the pc has so much attention on his troubles that an F/N obviously cannot beexpected.The whole cycle through the steps 1-19 may take several sessions, lasting between eightand fifteen hours, in some cases longer. When heavy engrams are contacted and many postulatesvoiced, it will naturally take longer than it would with a light case. Of course you will have to"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"44interrupt the cycle now and then, to take a break or to end off for the day. The best moment for thisis at the end of any of the major parts of the sequence. At times, however, it may have to be doneat a less optimum point, for example when an incident was reduced but not erased, or a postulatewas worked on with repeater technique and still is incomplete, i.e. no F/N on it yet. When youcarry on after the break, you will naturally take the session up at the exact point where you endedoff. So you cannot expect an F/N here either.You can absolutely rely on this: it goes on after the break or the next day, as if you neverhad interrupted the session. The case keeps quiet. It doesn’t run away in the meantime orrestructure itself. What you are handling with the pc is so fundamental and has been stable for sucha long time that it won’t change just in a few hours.Another case: Supposing you had erased an incident or de-activated a postulate and hadhad an F/N before the break, you would naturally expect an F/N at the start of the next session.And then you notice with dismay that there isn’t one! Don’t worry about it. Just carry on. Whatstep follows next? Or: What postulate is next on your list? The F/N is suppressed by the fact thatthe next step or postulate is already keyed in . This is true in most cases. However, should there bea whole night or even several days between two sessions and should there be no F/N and even ahigh TA at the start of the next session, you would be well advised to ask the pc: “How have youbeen doing since your last session?” He will tell you. If he gives you a well-reading item which isentirely different from what you would have expected according to your notes, you do take thenew item up. Work it through and then return to the point on your program where you left off, andcontinue with your next auditing step, the next postulate on your list, or a new item (step 1).Usually, though, whatever happened during the break will have to do with the next auditing stepyou would have done anyway; you’ll have no problem recognizing this. (In one case the pc wasoff for two full years but the auditing could continue as if the last session had only been yesterday.)You cannot audit against the bank but only with it, and with the willingness of the pc toconfront it. Follow the direction the attention of the pc takes; pick up what is available next . Whenit reads it is offering itself to be taken up. This way you find your entry point into the bank quiteeffortlessly. Remember that the auditor first listens and only then computes. Never make a millioncomputations about a case and then sit down to audit something that isn’t really there . You wouldrisk projecting your own case, or that of another, on the case of the pc. This would violate point 1and 21 of the Auditor’s Code.There may be cycles within cycles within cycles. This does happen occasionally. But neverleave an open cycle incomplete! You’ll plough your pc under this way, and yourself along with it.Therefore: take good notes - particularly of the exact wording of reading items and postulates - andkeep your worksheets tidy. This way you won’t lose sight of where you were coming from andwhere you are going to.(References: all HCOBs on R3RA and on Dianetics, see index of Tech Vol.X-XII.

This becomes apparent to the extent that he moves away from using thesimple techniques described up to this point, auditing for the benefit of his friends or his family,and begins increasingly to work with the E-meter in the attempt to resolve complex case situationsand take someone up to Clear. Once one starts working on a professional level it is unavoidablethat one differentiate one’s activity into different roles, even though the whole team may consist ofoneself only. Therefore the auditor must make it clear to the pc from which role he is talking so asnot to confuse him when he changes from one role to the other, as a different behavior pattern goeswith each one. (It’s easier when each function is performed by a different person.)THE INTERVIEWERBefore a session cycle, an interview is done. Interviews are ordered by the person who isoverseeing the auditors, the case supervisor or “C/S”. (The role of the case supervisor is describedin the section further on.)The interview is done exactly according to the instructions of the C/S.Out-of-session chats should never concern the case of the pc. They are not an interview.An interview is always done formally. It may happen, though, that the pc - perhaps eveninadvertently - comes up with case data out of session. Of this a written note must be made andhanded in to the case supervisor to be kept in the pc’s folder so that the case will not turn into anenigma at some later stage.THE AUDITORThe most fundamental tasks of the auditor have already been discussed thoroughly in thechapter on simple techniques. Therefore it seems sufficient to keep it short and only repeat a keyparagraph here: The auditor has his auditing commands and his TRs. He does no more than puttingthe pc in session (TR-0). giving the auditing command (TR-1), acknowledging the pc’s answer(TR-2), and getting the pc back to the auditing command when he wanders off (TR-3, TR-4) .Further than that, the auditor does not talk. His behavior is wholly determined by the Auditor’sCode . There is nothing ritualistic or artificial about this code. It provides a frame of reference forthe auditor’s behavior which he is obliged to adhere to, as otherwise the session would come to abad end. When it is violated, wins and results cannot be guaranteed. It is a strictly functional code.with the exception of some “political” points (24-28) which have no bearing on the actual session.When the pc originates something which makes it unwise to continue the particular processhe is on, i.e. when a situation arises which cannot be solved by TR-4 but in fact requires a different"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"46process than the one that is being run, the auditor ends off. He asks the pc if there is anything elsehe would like to say or ask before the end of the session, and hands the folder in to the C/S (casesupervisor).THE CASE SUPERVISOR (C/S)When auditor and C/S are different persons and when there are several auditors to one C/S,the C/S would not himself audit. He may never even see the pc whose case he is C/Sing. The C/Sreceives a cardboard folder which contains the session write-up done by the auditor, andadjudicates what should be done in the next session. If needed, he corrects the auditor by givinghim a study assignment to do.The C/S works on data only, not on opinion. To him, what isn’t written in the folder isn’ttrue. Anything relevant to handling the pc’s case must appear in written form and be put in thefolder may it come from the interviewer, the auditor, the examiner (see below), a friend or a familymember of the pc. If he doesn’t have enough data to work out a strategy for solving the case hetells the interviewer to do an interview and get data. Or he asks the course supervisor or the ethicsconsultant for data.In truth, the C/S does a data evaluation: he finds “plus-points’ and “out-points”,importance’s and unimportance’s, and compares them. (See Mgmt. Dictionary and Axiom 58.)In this work, he is not interested in significance’s, but in masses He judges the importanceof data by the amount of E-meter reads they have. In his program, he puts the area of biggestcharge as the first one to be handled. This area is most real to the pc because it troubles him themost, and can be confronted best. A program is a series of steps which help the pc to as-is thecharge he has on the areas mentioned in his interview. Each step on the program should have thepc fully “in session” . “In session” means high interest and lots of big reads. This is the mark of agood program. An uneventful program and a bored pc indicate that the C/S didn’t evaluate his datawell. (For full instructions on C/Sing see the C/S-Series in Vol.X and the “Class VIII Notes” byBill Robertson.)In the case of a one-man band the auditor himself is the C/S Even then he does the C/Singin his own time and space and no during the session. (See ivory tower rule.) He does not “C/S inthe chair”. Going off the process and replacing it by another one, is considered so, for example.Changing the process to suit the pc’s origination’s, is a Q & A. (See the Tech Dict for this termalso C/S-Series 55 and 89, in Vol X.) - But: getting a result is always the best excuse for whateverone did. Always keep the product in mind and don’t be rigid about the rules. (See ‘ In structor’sStable Data” in [1], and HCO PL 19 March 1968, Service”, in Mgmt. Vol. 0.)THE EXAMINERIt is found to be valuable for another than the “usual” auditor to be available immediatelyafter session, to look at the pc and note down his indicators and meter reactions. This person iscalled the “examiner”. He works with the E-meter. The pc can comment to him about the session,"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"47his wins or losses. This provides additional data for the C/S. If, for example, the pc seems upset atsession end, it wouldn’t go unnoticed.Also the pc has someone to whom he can make a statement about how he feels in generalor with regard to his auditing, if he needs to. The auditor is one “ear” of the C/S, the examiner theother.The examiner fulfills another function as well he takes care of attesting. This is alsochecked on an E-meter. It is customary to attest to the completion of a study course or auditingrundown after completing it. “To attest” means to make it known to all concerned. This is done bytelling the examiner about the auditing or training cycle one has completed, and putting in writingwhat one has got out of it. This makes a public acknowledgment and validation for the completion,and does help the pc to accept that he has handled this particular aspect of awareness or ability.The examiner makes sure that the person attesting has good indicators and the correspondingneedle response on the E-meter.The attest by a pc or student always refers to a potential performance, not a realperformance. He attests to the fact that an ability has been newly learned or rehabilitated; he doesnot attest to already having demonstrated it many times under all sorts of difficult circumstances.We are not expecting people to suddenly be able to do something that is “out-gradient” justbecause they have attested. We are looking for an improvement in the ordinary daily performance.For example this woman who just attested to a communications course. She can talk to herneighbor now and before she couldn’t. You wouldn’t expect her to suddenly be able to speak totwenty thousand people in a football stadium! But what she has achieved, should beacknowledged by attesting to it. And then it’s up to her to expand on her ability by makingobservations, applying her new knowledge, studying and drilling. How soon and how far oneprogresses, is always a personal matter.This may sound easy and matter-of-course. It isn’t, unfortunately. Because some peoplewill always project all their desires and failed purposes into the attests of others, and if they seeanother who has attested Clear and doesn’t live up to their standards or imagination, they will say“it isn’t worth going Clear”, or “if that’s a Clear then I’ve been Clear all along, too”. And so itgoes with OTIII, Excalibur, and Case Completion. And it always was so, throughout the history ofscientology. Whosoever makes it to the top of the bridge must be the exact superman one alwayswished to be oneself: “If he doesn’t act the way I think he should, then he just can’t be an OT”.The C/S must never make this mistake. He looks at Fred as Fred goes into session, and helooks at Fred as Fred comes out of session, and if there was improvement in between (concerningthe subject matter of the level audited), he allows Fred to attest. And he makes sure that Fred doesa course or a little application program so Fred can settle in on his new ability level. And as long asFred keeps improving, all is well. -The C/S never compares Fred with Joe! He never comparesanyone with anyone else. He only measures improvement along the individual gradient scale of theperson concerned. He never tries to turn a duck into an eagle, yet he always tries to turn a duckinto a better duck.(Note: The failure of the standardized sequence of bridge steps, which has occurred consistentlysince 1968, isn’t just that it gives an unthinking approach to “handling” all cases, but that it allows"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"48free rein to this sort of comparison and invalidation, and encourages the superman syndrome”.Much better to have a procedural approach that identifies major personal wins and encouragesattests when appropriate, to punctuate progress.)THE ETHICS CONSULTANTThe ethics consultant looks with the pc at the reality of the pc’s life and helps him to decideon a more pro-survival course. To “get ethics in” on one’s life means as much as creating the ordernecessary to attain a postulated goal. This is best done after an auditing cycle when the pc’s chargeis gone and his confront on life has increased. It may have to be done before an auditing cyclewhen the pc has such aggravating life difficulties that he can’t get auditing, because he is kept sotied up by them.A lot of the public protest against scientology was connected with the harsh treatments of“scientology ethics” customary in the CofS. It was, for example, enforced that pcs or students“disconnect” from their friends, spouses or parents, because the “ethics officer” considered them“antagonistic to scientology”. But distilled out of the whole subject are some valuable ideas abouthow to handle the conditions of life more effectively. The “Volunteer Minister’s Handbook”contains a section on this and it should be studied, as often specific assistance with handling life isnecessary, for some pc’s, in order to allow lasting case changes to occur from their auditing [17]."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"49 2.The Language Of The E-MeterHOW THE E-METER WORKSThe E-meter (electropsychometer) is essentially a Wheatstone bridge. Much as it’s a simplemeasuring device in principle, the actual building of it demands some skill - evidenced by the factthat there has been a sequence of seven models from the time it was first used (1953) until today,each being an improvement compared to the previous one. When you include the ones developedand produced outside the CofS - often of considerably better quality - they add up to about adozen.The E-meter isn’t influenced by the sweat on the pc’s hands but by the electrical resistanceof mental masses around the pc. This is how it works: a battery inside it sends a very low voltagecurrent (9 Volts) through a wire which is clipped to an ordinary tin can the pc holds in one hand.The current runs around his body and is picked up again by a tin can the pc holds in his otherhand, and led off back into the negative pole of the battery inside the meter. Only 2 Volts actuallyarrive at the pc.As the current “runs around the pc’s body” it encounters a certain resistance due to thephysical conditions of the body. As well it encounters the mental masses produced by the pc in theeffort to not look at the terrible things in the engram. These masses add to the body resistance andmake the needle rise on the dial. The needle goes to the left. In order to keep the needle on the“set”-position on the dial, the auditor would have to move it to the right. To do so, he turns a knobon the face of the meter clockwise . This way he “opens the throttle” and allows more current toflow out in order to overcome the increased resistance. This knob is called the Tone Arm (TA),indicating the “tone”, the mental tenseness or relaxedness, of the pc. It has a scale around it and apointer towards this scale. Therefore, when the pc starts encountering an engram, the needle rises”to the left on its scale. The TA “rises” to the right on it’s scale, turned by the auditor in order tocompensate for the rising of the needle.When the pc has duplicated some part of the engram and managed to look at it as it is, histension immediately relaxes. What he can “have”, he won’t resist any more. Therefore theelectrical resistance of his “mental defense shield” lessens, too, the needle falls to the right on thedial and the auditor has to adjust the Tone Arm to put the needle back on set. This is called a TAblowdown or BD.The amount of charge “blown” can be told by the difference between the two positions ofthe TA. At session start the TA pointed at the 2.5 mark on the scale around it. At peak point, whenthe pc’s resistance at looking at the engram was the highest, the TA had gone up to 4.6. Then, afterthe pc managed to look at and have that particular part of the engram’s content, the TA shot downto 3.1. So the total charge blown at this point is the difference between 4.6 and 3.1, which is 1.5.As only part of the engram was found, the auditor sends the pc through his recall again and again.Everytime the TA will go up and come down in the manner described. At the end of the session,when the pc has seen and re-experienced the engramic incident in all detail and has nothing left hecouldn’t easily have, the TA will not move anymore. The process has gone flat. No furtherrestimulation is possible concerning this engram; it has erased. Now the auditor adds up theindividual downward motions of the Tone Arm and divides it by the number of session hours to"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"50get the average. Five units TA motion per hour - the TA-Action or TAA - would be quiteeffective and acceptable. The more the better. The correct TAA-value per session is brought aboutby the auditor keeping the needle on the set”-mark as much as he can. This means that he has tocompensate each needle motion to the left or right by adjusting the Tone Arm accordingly. Whenhe does not do this, big reads the pc may have will appear only on the needle dial and not count onthe TA-motion . Which makes the session look as if there had been very little TAA only. (See E-Meter Drill 6.)This figure of “TAA per hour” is a valuable indicator for the progress the pc is making.When there is no TA action, the auditing process or even the program have to be changed becausethey are obviously inefficient.Reading the E-meter properly takes quite a lot of skill and experience. Therefore a lot ofemphasis in auditor training is put on the “E-Meter Drills”. To the beginner the needle seems but amadly wiggling thingamajig; to the expert each needle motion allows exact conclusions regardingthe flow of the pc’s attention. The meter does not tell the auditor what picture the pc sees; it doestell him, though, when the pc is approaching a “hot area”, when he is backing off from it, when heis right in it blowing it to pieces, and also when there is no charge left on an item and the auditingaction is complete. The meter allows the auditor to steer the pc’s attention exactly, and thereforemakes for efficient and intensive session work.Auditing happens between two thetans: the auditor and the pc. It does not happen betweenthe auditor and his E-Meter. The auditor observes the pc’s indicators, such as his fluctuations onthe tone scale, his delay in responding or answering a question (comm lag), his blushing orblanching, smiling or crying, his change from brightness to dullness and back. As well he observesthe needle reactions on the meter. It gives him an additional indicator. This is because some chargemay be so minute that you, as the auditor, won’t be able to tell from the pc’s face if there was areaction to your question or not. But on the meter you get a small Fall (sF) and now you knowthere is charge on the process. The meter cannot replace the live ARC between auditor and pc, butit can add valuable information without which the process may come to a standstill or the sessiongo off the rails. The meter is a steering device. That’s its whole purpose.WHAT IS A READ?A read means: a charged item was located and the charge reduced. How does charge comeabout’? By the pc wishing to know something and not knowing it. Basically because he haspostulated that he won’t know it or that he can’t confront it. The harder the pc wants to know andthe more difficult it is for him to find out, the more charge there will be. Consequently thereduction of charge sets in when the pc moves off from the point of not-know towards beingwilling to know.Not knowing something one desires to know creates tension such as in the case of readinga thriller or wondering what one is going to get for Christmas. Finding out and knowing bringsrelief. Anytime the pc (or any person) experiences relief there will be a big read. For a little bit ofrelief only, there will be a small read. It all depends on the importance the pc puts on the item in thefirst place and on the amount of engram content he can confront at a time."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"51These are the most common reads:Small Fall (sF): The needle moves 0.6 to 1,5 cm to the right.Fall (F): 1.5 to 3 cm.Long Fall (LF): 3 to 4.5 cm.Long Fall Blowdown (LFBD): When the needle does a Long Fall and stays on the right handside of the dial, the auditor must move the TA to the left in order to bringthe needle back up to “set”. This way the TA “blows down”.Tick (T): A Tick is smaller than a sF. Usually it is not taken up as it is a sign ofthere not being enough charge to deal with the item successfully. It does notcount as a read, strictly speaking, but just as a hint to a possible read. Onepokes about a little in this particular area, but when there is not more thananother tick or two, one should leave it alone.Dirty Needle (D.N.): It looks like many little ticks going left and right in an irregularfashion. It signifies that something goes on “down below” which has notbeen voiced yet.(References: “The Book of E-Meter Drills”, “E-Meter Essentials”, “Introduction to the E-Meter”,by L.Ron Hubbard.)”YES” AND “NO”Your E-Meter’s language is simple: it can say either “yes” or “no”. You ask a questionand get a read: that means “yes”. You get no read: that means “no”. The pc says something; itreads: “yes”. It doesn’t read: “no”. (See C/S-Series 24.)The read confirms the auditor’s question or the pc’s origination as true. Why? - Because anas-isness occurs, however small it may be. “Truth is the exact consideration; the exact time, place,form, and event. Thus we see that the discovery of truth would bring about an As-isness by actualexperiment. “ (From Axiom 38. The “actual experiment” is the session itself.)Any partial as-isness reduces some of the charge, so you have less electrical resistance, soyou get a read.Examples:“Do you have a problem?” plus read: He has a problem. (Meter confirms thequestion.)“Do you have a problem?”, no read: He doesn’t have one.“Do you have a problem?”, no read. Pc says, “No, I don’t think so”, plus read: Hedoesn’t have one. (Meter confirms pc’s answer.)"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"52Pc says at session start, “I feel great today”, plus read: He had a release, but there is somecharge connected with it. Find out about the release and acknowledge it. If it F/N’s, great, leave itat that. If not, the read means there is bank accessible connected with it that should be dealt withwhile it is restimulated, to consolidate the win. Hence one should “rehab” the release part. (See thesection on “Rehabilitation” further down in the text.)Pc says at session start, “Last night I had a terrible dream”, with no read. So there is nocharge . Acknowledge politely, but do not take it up. Go into the process you have a C/S-instruction for.THE INSTANT READ“An instant read is defined as that reaction of the needle which occurs at the precise end ofany major thought voiced by the auditor “ “By major thought is meant the complete thought beingexpressed in words by the auditor “ (HCOB May 25, 1962)Precise as these definitions are, they still lead to confusion on the side of the auditor withthe result of charge being stirred up and left on the case of the pc.When is the instant read to occur? At the end of the last syllable uttered by the auditor or atthe end of the major thought? Are we talking about auditing as a mest universe phenomenon or atheta phenomenon? If we were to say that the read has to occur at the moment the last soundwavehas left the auditor’s mouth we would be talking about a mest universe phenomenon. But auditingis an ARC game, not a mest game! It has to do with attention and intention, with the auditingcomm-cycle (Tech Dict.). Which means that the pc’s attention and interest count. not the soundwaves of the auditor. The pc’s in-session-ness is the senior factor. When the pc is on the line to hisbank for one or even five seconds and then has a read and then originates an answer with read andinterest and corresponding indicators, are you going to drop it because “it occurred too late”? Hewas on the line to his bank, he was on the major thought voiced in words by the auditor, he was insession on it, he found something which read and he was interested in talking about it, so there wastruth, there was a partial as-isness - so of course you take it up! - If not you will have stirred upcharge and left it unhandled, and very soon you will get a dirty needle, a rising TA, a stuck needleand all the other things no auditor really likes.You have to get the pc to put a commline over to his bank, and therefore you must allow acommunication lag - as long as the pc’s attention is on the command! Only acute observation canhelp you through this. Four situations are possible: 1. Pc didn’t pay attention when you gave thecommand and thought of something else anyway: prior read. 2. Pc got the command, has nointerest, there is no read; no button was pressed at all. The pc’s mind wanders off to something elseand that reads: latent read. 3. Pc got the command, introverts, looks around in his mind, commlags,then gives a reading answer which makes sense regarding the command: instant read. 4. Auditorgives command, gets a read immediately, pc hesitates a moment, then gives a sensible and readinganswer: the absolute model of an instant read! (See C/S-Series 24.)Naturally, when you do a rapid assessment by instant read (i.e when you rattle off thequestions on a previously prepared list), you take the read that occurs the moment you havefinished speaking. (See E-Meter Drill 24.) This, however, works only when you have excellent"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"53duplication and understanding on the part of the pc! In order to live through a rapid assessment, thepc must have a conceptual understanding of what the auditor says. If not, you get the phenomenagoing along with misunderstood words, such as dirty needles, pc’s face going grey, and other nastythings.It takes a very well grooved in pc for you to just say: “Please lean back for a moment; I’mdoing this assessment. You don’t have to say anything whilst I’m doing it.” And then it goespakata-pakata-pakata (as Hubbard would say): there’s your assessment shooting off and there areyour reads. - It’s true that the assessment goes “right to the pcs bank “ (Tech Dict . ), but the bankdoesn’t speak English ! So of course it’s a conceptual thing. If the pc has no concept of what youare talking about, there will be no reads. If the thetan (pc) didn’t have to be involved during theassessment one should be able to do an assessment in a foreign language and still get reads. But tryto assess an L1C (List 1C, a repair list) in English on a Spaniard and you’ll see that it won’t work!- So it only goes “straight to the pc’s bank”, IF the thetan acts as a communicator and opens thedoor to the bank. No magic involved, only the application of the communication formula.THE FLOATING NEEDLE (F/N)The F/N is the most difficult needle characteristic of them all. This is because it comes in somany different forms and sizes. “Floating Needle: the idle uninfluenced movement of the needleon the dial without any patterns or reactions in it. (. . .) It moves to the left at the same speed as itmoves to the right. (. . .) It ceases to register on the pcs bank. It just idly floats about(. . .) “ (TechDict.).Many beginning auditors think that an F/N ought to be perfectly symmetrical around thecenter of the dial, and at least as wide as a Fall. However, this is not implied by the definition givenabove. It may be a rhythmical motion to the right, like three large right-hand swings with smallerleft-hand swings in between. It may just be one swing either side and not even symmetrical. It maybe dialwide and of short duration, or only as wide as a third of the dial and last for minutes. Or anyof the above combinations. - On a high TA, when you are battling away to get the TA down, itmay not be more than the momentary easing up of a tight needle, with a corresponding brighteningup of the pc. (See the chapter on “High TA” further down.) Some people really have troubletelling the difference between a sequence of sF’s or F’s, and an F/N. -The best way to tell: look atthe pc! If the pc were not released the needle wouldn’t float. So it’s not just the meter that shows anF/N, the pc does, too!The F/N, by the way, is the only meter read which is indicated by the auditor to the pc.Doing so, he acknowledges the release the pc has experienced. One has to be careful not toindicate the F/N too early as that may interrupt the pc’s cognition and make the F/N ceaseprematurely.How does an F/N come to be? At the moment you give the auditing command the pcconnects up with a ridge and a small as-isness occurs; you get a read. From this moment on theattention of the pc is on the GPM/ridge/engram/secondary/lock/ incident/picture until he has as-ised(blown) it fully. With an engram, this is called erasure; with a lock, it’s a key-out. At this moment itgoes ‘pop” and the compulsive commline to the terminal/item breaks. The pc has no more attentionon the thing. And that is the moment the needle floats! Its importance is that it indicates when tostop, i.e when the particular auditing cycle is complete . When it’s a big release it will keep on"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"54floating for a while . When the pc is in the middle of a series of processes, though, which all dealwith the same area of charge (e.g. “the 2nd dynamic”), then his F/N will not last long. It will stopas soon as the next ridge has attracted the pc’s attention.In detail: He has had attention on one particular bit of bank in this area; he has blown that,F/N. Now he is drawn back into the area by the next bit of bank. The F/N stops. You give the nextcommand, get a read, work it over, F/N; next command, read, work it over, F/N, etc., till the wholearea is discharged and the pc has a big release and a large F/N and VVGIs.One may observe that there is a correspondence between the amount of TAA a processhad, and the size and the duration of the final F/N. They seem to be in direct proportion with eachother. So when you have run an auditing question which had a sF, and the pc has as-ised thecharge rather briefly with no more than another sF, you can’t expect to get a huge F/N. Don’t try toget one - you’ll end up in a stupid overrun! On the other hand, after a 2-hour auditing action on“my schoolteacher” with 22 divisions of TA-Action, you will see a big and lasting F/N as part ofthe EP.F/Ns are usually “indicated” to the pc, which means one tells him that he just has one .This is a way of acknowledging (TR-2) that an auditing cycle has been completed, that a releasewas attained. The disadvantage of this procedure is that it may make the pc dependent on his F/Ns!In the end he will run the process only in order to get his F/N. Or he accepts the indication of anF/N (in case of an auditor error) without the feeling of having completed anything. In either casethe pc is not properly in session. Hence it is much better to have him experience his F/N a fewtimes until he knows what he should feel like when the auditor says: “I’d like to indicate, yourneedle is floating”. This way he learns to find certainty in himself and not in the E-meter.HIGH TA F/NsWhat is a “high TA”? According to the Tech Dictionary it’s a TA above 3.5 on the TA-scale. An F/N - again according to theTech Dict. - must occur between TA 2.0 and 3 .0 to bevalid. Years later, in C/S-Series 99, Hubbard revised this and stated that an F/N always is an F/N,no matter how high the TA.High-TA F/Ns occur whilst you are working on something. Don’t settle for an EP-F/Nabove 3.5. You may have worked on something, brought the TA down from 5.3 to 4.5 and got anF/N there; small and short perhaps, but an F/N. That’s very good. But you want it down in the EPrange below 3.5. This will make a lot of difference to the pc. So do find those last scraps of chargeon the respective subject by all means, and end off with an F/N below 3.5. It will make quite adifference to the well-being of the pc.THE ARC-BREAK F/NThere is the paradoxical phenomenon of an F/N occurring whilst the pc has very badindicators (VBIs). How is this possible? Well, the answer is quite easy once you have understoodwhat a read is and what an F/N is."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"55A read means “something there” (i.e. a mass) .The pc looks at it in auditing. At the end ofthe process you get an F/N. An F/N means “nothing there where before there was something”. Aread is the meter reaction to a somethingness the F/N the meter reaction to a nothingness.When the pc is totally ARC-broken he is totally out of communication, has totally noreality and no affinity with anything. There is no commline to the bank. Therefore, when you asksuch a pc an auditing question, nothing will register. And that’s why you get an F/N. It means“nothing there where there may be something but I’m too hopeless to even look”. -The technicalterm for this phenomenon is “ARC-Break F/N”.THE DIRTY NEEDLESome auditors have come to believe that a Dirty Needle (D.N.) can mean one thing only:the pc has a mw/h (missed withhold). Dirty needle = mw/h. That simple. So there is somethingterrible and nasty the pc is hiding: let’s get it out of him! (See C/S Series 1.) This is asoversimplified as it’s unfair on the pc. It means putting the whole blame for the D.N. on him. Butmost of the time, in fact, the needle is dirtied by the auditor himself, i.e..by his bad TR’s! - If youdon’t believe it, re-read E-Meter drill 20. It shows you ten ways of dirtying a clean needle bymeans of a bad comm cycle.In the final analysis, the equation “D.N. = mw/h” is true, though. Because the auditor’sbad TRs produce a no-comm situation with the pc trying to say something without being listenedto! The w/h is actually enforced on the pc. This is covered under “unintentional withhold” intheTech Dictionary. (But never forget: It could be a real nasty withhold, too!)THREE BUTTONS TO CHECK FOR CHARGEAs long as a thetan cannot have the is-ness of a certain charge it will not read on the meter,but there won’t be an F/N either. The pc is blocking the access to his case. In order to find outwhat he is doing to hold the charge off his awareness (not-is), you do this little assessment: “Onthis question, has anything been suppressed/invalidated/not-ised?” And that will read on the meterwhen there is charge.Supposing you had a read on one of the three buttons, e.g. on “suppressed”, you do notask: “What has been suppressed?”, because you would go off the actual auditing question. Insteadyou keep insisting on the question you have started with. You could tell the pc what’s going on, bysaying: “I’d like to indicate to you that something was suppressed on the question ‘Do you have aproblem?’ What problem is that?” And now he will find one. (It could of course be a “false read”see the next section.)When you do not get a read on the initial question nor on the three buttons, you can be surethat there is no charge present. Actually, there ought to be an F/N now. If this is not the case, it iswise to tell the pc that there is no charge indeed. This makes him relax and then there will be anF/N for sure. An auditor who is a real craftsman would only allow two possibilities with regard toan auditing question: a read or an F/N. To leave a question open, i.e. with no read and no F/N,would not even cross his mind."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"56The explanation for this phenomenon is given in Axiom 11. The buttons suppress,invalidate and not-is relate to the conditions of existence of alter-isness and not-isness.In HCOB “Rudiments, Definitions and Patter” (Tech Vol.XI) only one button(“suppress”) is mentioned. But, according to this Axiom, it is perfectly all right to use three.THE FALSE READYou ask a question like: “Do you have a problem?” and get a read. The pc says: “No, notreally” and has a read on that, too. That is a “false read”, according to the hallowed rule whichsays: if there is any doubt, the answer of the pc is right. There was a read all right, but it did notrelate to what you have asked. It’s on something else - after all, there was an energy which pushedthe needle over. The energy didn’t come from the thing you asked for; so where did it come from?If we exclude things like body motion and pc sighing or coughing right at that moment, then itmust have come from the bank. So what button was pushed that caused the read? Simple: beingasked such a question at all. “How dare you . . . !” That’s the button.Therefore a false read is the pc’s protest against what you are asking him. And that’s whyyou handle a false read with the question: “Did anyone say you had a problem when you didn’thave one? (read)” . - Pc: “Yes (read), my mother always told me I was looking so confused whenI wasn’t confused at all ! (read)”. So the pc felt evaluated for or invalidated, and he was protestingit then just as he is protesting it now. What you are really running here is a chain of protests aboutinval/eval. Get all of the incident, when/where/what happened exactly; and then: “Is there anearlier similar time someone said you had a problem when you didn’t have one?” At the end of thechain you’ll get a keyout and F/N plus VGIs.COMPLETING CYCLES OF ACTIONWhen you pick up an item or a question, it must of course have read. Either on the questionitself, or on checking the three buttons mentioned above. One never takes up unreading questionsand items as there is the danger that the pc starts imagining things or gets pushed into his bank .The read on the question or the item is the start of a cycle of action, the process its continuation, theF/N or the EP its end. You must end everything you have started, because if you don’t, if youwork on something over an incomplete cycle of action, there will be over-restimation and the pcwill feel overwhelmed.As one asks an auditing question, one has to make sure that the read occurs not only on thequestion, but on the answer as well! Failing to do this may result in your running an unreading itemthe one mentioned by the pc - although there was a read on the actual question. Example: “Haveyou committed an overt?” (F). Pc: “Recently, when I took a walk in the park, I threw an emptycigarette pack on the lawn instead of putting it in the nearest rubbish bin” (x, i.e. no read). If theauditor were to take this up, had the pc tell all about it and then went earlier-similar on it, he wouldtotally audit past the thing which actually caused the read. He would have taken up an unreadingitem - the one offered by the pc. And soon the usual trouble would follow: needle tightening up,"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"57TA rising, pc becoming disinterested, chain not coming to an end. Incomplete cycle of action.Very embarrassing!The correct action in this case would have been to ask the pc: “Is there perhaps anotherovert?” (Again the F). “Well,” says the pc, “When I drove my father’s car the other day, Ibumped against the garage door and didn’t tell my father it was me who made the dent” (sF). Thatis the answer the auditor should take up. The read on the answer was smaller than the read on thequestion, yes, but that does not matter. That is merely a matter of the pc’s confront of his overt. Theimportant thing is that there was a read.The lesson to be learned here: the read on the auditor’s question must be echoed by theread on the pc’s answer. When this happens one can be certain that the cycle of action of thisparticular auditing process can be taken to its proper end. (See C/S-Series 89 in Vol.X.)INDICATION OF CHARGE AND WHYIt is the purpose of auditing to re-establish the pc’s certainty of self. “Certainty in all threeuniverses must be regained, for certainty, not data, is knowledge” (Factor 28) . The only reason,then, why a person would want auditing, is his or her lack of certainty with respect to some areasin one of the three universes. To coax him into being more certain, the auditor indicates to the pcthat there is charge on his origination or the item in question. This acts as a special kind of TR-2(acknowledgment). This confirms what the pc has felt and thereby gradually increases hiscertainty.Examples: Pc: “I always had a problem with my uncle”. - Read. (Pc isn’t quite sure if thisis important.) -Auditor: “I’d like to indicate, there IS charge on this problem!” - Pc (certain now):“Well, you know - I actually thought so! This has bothered me for many years.” Etc., etc.In this case the indication has opened the pc’s “outflow valve” (Itsa-line, Tech Dict.); hefeels reassured that it isn’t just an imagined problem but a real one and therefore is immediately insession on it.Auditor: “Have you committed an overt?” - No read. - “On this question, anythingsuppressed?” - No read. - Pc says nothing and anxiously waits for the auditor to say something. Hedoesn’t think there is any overt in particular but doesn’t feel sure enough to say so. After all, lifehas been so long and one has done so many things which weren’t ok. So who could safely say thathe never committed an overt? - Auditor: “I’d like to indicate, there’s no charge on this question”. -Pc (relieved): “Oh - good.” - F/N. In this case there was nothing in the bank, so there was no read.Yet there was attention on the question itself; so there was no F/N, either. The certainty created bythe auditor’s indication took the pc’s attention away from the question so that the needle couldfloat.(The best address for E-meters is “Ability Meters International”, 9 Portland Road, East Grinstead,West-Sussex, RH19 4EB, England.)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"583. Preparing The SessionCLEARING WORDSYou must make sure that the pc understands the key words which go along with theauditing he receives. Build it up as you go along.

False TA may be due to cold hands,cold feet, tight clothes, dry hands, wrong can grip. Handle accordingly. A real high TAwould demand a handling in session and require a change of C/S. That’s why you have tofind out if your high TA is real or false.3) He asks the pc if he is tired or hungry or physically worn out. (Ref.: Auditor’s Code.) If so:handle accordingly. You want the pc’s attention on his case not on his body. Should the pcbe unsessionable and you continue nevertheless, you will soon see the needle- and TA-motion tightening up. In the case of an EP, the F/N will be short and narrow or not come atall; the VGIs of the pc will look rather muffled.4) He asks the pc to take a deep breath and blow it out hard, watches the needle read, andthereby finds out about the pc’s metabolism.5) The auditor asks the pc if he has taken drugs, medicine or alcohol. - If so, the sessioncannot be started as the pc has to “dry out” first. Reason: a pc under the influence of drugs,medicine, or alcohol will have bad recall, a sticky needle and very little TA-motion.(HCOB 17 Oct 69: “Drugs, Aspirin, and Tranquilizers”, Tech Vol.XI or [17].)6) He asks the pc if he feels comfortable. (Chair, temperature, etc.)7) He asks: “Is there any reason why we shouldn’t start the session now?”8) All ok: “This is the session!”THE CAN SQUEEZEE-Meter Drill 5 and 5 RA both say something substantial separately but neither of the twocombines it. (See as well “E-Meter Essentials”, section E.) EM-5 says the can squeeze checks thepc’s current state of Havingnes. EM-5 RA says one has to adjust the sensitivity so the needle fallsover one third of the dial when the pc squeezes the cans. Neither of the two state clearly how hardone is supposed to squeeze - which has driven some auditors (and pc’s) to despair.A “light squeeze” may be entirely different when it’s repeated a second or third time fromhow it was done the first time, so there’s a different size read each time. The answer to thedifficulty lies in the definition of Havingness and its application to the can squeeze.“HAVINGNESS, 1. that which permits the experience of mass and pressure”. [2] This meanshaving ARC with a somethingness, a terminal.As the pc squeezes the cans he demonstrates by the drop of the needle how far he iscapable of experiencing the mass and pressure of the cans on his hands. Therefore the pc shouldsqueeze as hard as he can - slowly and steadily, yes, but as hard as he can. When one has him"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"60squeeze the cans two or three times, one keeps at least one variable stable: his pressure. -The othervariable one adjusts as required, by setting the sensitivity knob to a needle drop of 1/3 on the dial.The can squeeze does not measure the muscular strength of the pc, but his Havingness.This is easily observable . When the pc squeezes the cans the needle will move gradually to theright and then stop, although the pc may still be increasing the power of his squeeze! So hismuscular strength does not push the needle further over than his Havingness allows. The reverseeffect one can observe when the pc’s Havingness has increased after a session; usually thesensitivity could now be adjusted lower than before. (Try it out and see!) This is surely not becausethe pc’s muscle power would have increased within a session of one and a half hours! - It’s hisability to experience mass and pressure which has increased.Why does one measure Havingness at all? - Because one has to adjust the meter (sensitivityknob) so it reads on the masses in the case of the pc. This adjustment is conveniently done bymeasuring the pc’s ability to experience the masses of the cans.A pc whose Havingness is low, will feel the mass of the cans to a certain extent as hesqueezes them, but not sufficiently to make the meter read on a sensitivity setting of e.g. 2.Accordingly he will not experience the masses of the bank sufficiently, given the same sensitivitysetting, as to make the needle register. Therefore, to get reads, one has to amplify the signals of thebank electronically by turning up the sensitivity knob. This of course does not increase theHavingness of the pc; it increases the signal strength which then makes reads possible. Whichmeans that this particular pc win have reads as soon as his sensitivity is set at 7, for example.METABOLISMHow come you get a read on the metabolism test (breath test)’? (See point 3 on the pre-session checklist.) To understand this you need to know three facts:Firstly: the current runs from the battery in the E-meter through the lead into one can,through the body into the other can, and back through the other lead, to the battery. The body has amass which the current has to overcome in order to get from one can to the other.Secondly: the digestive system turns the food you eat into carbohydrates (and other things).These are taken to the cells of the muscles and other organs through the blood stream. The lungstake up oxygen from the air. The oxygen is picked up in the blood stream, too, and taken to thecells in the body. The carbohydrates are burnt up by the oxygen in the cells to generate energy. Asusual, when something gets burnt up heat is generated. This is how the body stays warm. And thisis what’s called “metabolism”.Thirdly: a warm human body has a lower resistance than a cold one.Now this is what happens when you check for metabolism: When you breathe in deeply,hold the air for a moment, and then breathe out vigorously, there will be a steep increase of oxygenin the blood stream. Naturally, the rate of combustion will increase, too. (As anyone knows whohas ever blown into the open flames of a fire . ) Now of course the body temperature rises (breathehard ten times and you’ll see) and the body resistance against electrical current is lowered. This"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"61decrease of resistance is expressed in the meter read: the electrical resistance of the body drops,which makes the needle fall and the TA come down - if only in degrees.But: the combustion rate will only increase if there is actual oxygen entering the bloodstream with actual carbohydrates there and ready to get burnt up. So if you don’t get a read it maymean that the pc didn’t eat right, that he didn’t sleep right, or that he didn’t breathe right. Or it maymean that there is something wrong with his system, and the food doesn’t get turned into energy.In case of high TA you may have a hard time getting a read on the metabolism test. Do afalse TA check to make sure it’s nothing mechanical. (Pc too cold, etc.) If it is a real high TAcaused by charge, you will find quite often that it is this charge which suppresses the metabolismread. Don’t worry about it; go in session anyway, and handle the charge - provided the pc haseaten and slept well. The main stable datum here is the Auditor’s Code, points 5 and 6. If that is in,the auditor may take the pc in session. However, he must inform the pc about a weak metabolismread before he starts, because should it turn out that the needle does not read well in session (in theusual way for this pc), then the auditor can simply end the session with a short explanation of thematter and the pc will understand the situation.THE SESSIONThe preparations are all done now. The auditor starts the session with “This is thesession!”. If there is no F/N he flies as many rudiments as needed in order to have a stable F/N.Reason: you want the pc’s attention fully on the major process which is to be done in this sessionaccording to the C/S. One doesn’t go into a major action over out-ruds (see C/S-Series 1).The necessary ruds and then the major process for this session are taken to F/N and EP.Then the auditor asks: “Is there anything you’d like to say or ask before we end the session?” Thisprovides an opportunity for the pc to look back over the session and to originate on various aspectsof it. Should he have questions beyond the immediate scope of the session, the auditor notes themdown, acknowledges their importance and says that they will be taken up after the session . Thenhe gives his “End of session!”In either case the pc should have an F/N here. It means that the pc has ended the session forhimself. At the time of the EP he had an F/N on the process, now he has one on the end of thesession. There is a significant difference between the two. When there is no F/N after “say/ask?”,you know that there is something wrong. This is an important information for the C/S.Should anything unexpected happen which the auditor can’t handle on the spot, heexplains to the pc that he has to end the session in order to get a technical consultation, and turnsthe folder in to the C/S.When the pc has blown a lot of charge (as seen by plenty of TA action) he may feel anactual lack of mass and feel a bit woozy in the head. His F/N may be smaller than you wouldexpect in view of the big release he has. In this case you must replace the bank masses by theactual masses of the mest environment and make him repeatedly touch things or look at things orspot things in the room. (Each of these would be one process in itself. Do not give more than adozen commands because it will turn the orientation assist into an objective auditing process.) The"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"62pc will soon feel oriented again - a dozen commands is enough - and his F/N has a wider swingnow. He has lost reactively created dimension points in the bank because the engram has gone; hehas replaced them by analytically created ones. Now you can safely give your “End of Session!”(See HCOB 11 Aug 1978 II, “Model Session”, Tech Vol.XI.)ADMIN AND C/SingWhen the auditor has finished the session, he must do his session admin. This must be doneproperly as the “admin” of the session (an auditor slang term) communicates the session content tothe C/S. The C/S should be able to understand the run of the session without having to send for theauditor and ask him about particulars. A session consists of three different types of particles. Theyare stapled together and put into the folder, in this sequence: the worksheets at the bottom, next theAuditor Report Form, the C/S-sheet on the top.1. The Worksheets; They are notes of the session actions, usually written in two columns.What must be written in them is: a) Each auditor command, each reading origination of the pc (andothers, too, when you can write fast enough) . b)The pc’s change of indicators, such as position onthe tone scale and facial expression. c) The time goes on the left-hand margin of the column. d)The reads and any change of TA position go on the right hand margin beside the exact words ofthe pc that caused the read. e) F/Ns go in the middle of the column and are circled. To give theworksheets a clear appearance, it is recommended that auditor commands are underlined andauditor observations are put in brackets; pc origination’s stay as they are. This way the C/S can seeat one glance what was said by whom and how the process ran.2. The Auditor Report Form. It has the same function as the contents table of a book.The C/S should be able to look over the whole session as it is summarized on one or two pages.There are three columns, from left to right: 1. what process was done, 2. time and TA position atend of process, 3. EP or not plus auditor’s observations. The sensitivity is marked only once (incolumn 2) unless it changes during the session. - Pc’s name auditor’s name, date, TA-range, totalTA-action and session time should be noted at the top, like “pc Joe, auditor Fred. 6.8.1988, TA-range between 2.3 and 4.1; total TAA 16.4; session time: 2:35 (2 hours 35 minutes), previoussession time total: 16:12, new total: 18:47”.The ARF should reveal at one glance what decisions the auditor took during the session.Column 1:What did he do? Column 2 and 3: What was the result? Next line down, column 1:How did he carry on? Column 2 and 3: What was the result of that? And so on.3. The C/S-sheet. Here the auditor expresses his thoughts and comments about the sessionand draws the attention of the C/S to aspects not easily to be seen from the worksheets, like:“Today it didn’t run quite as smoothly as usual, needle was a bit tighter all in all, less flowy”.Organizationally speaking, the auditor is a junior to the C/S. The C/S is his senior. A juniorshould present solutions to his senior. He should not present problems. Therefore it is up to theauditor to suggest the instructions for the next session. It is looked at and considered ok or not okby the C/S."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"63The auditor’s comment (in red) presents the situation and gives all data. The auditor’s C/S(in blue) presents a solution. This solution must logically evolve out of the data given, and be infull alignment with the tech. Example:“No F/N at session end. High TA.” (Situation, red.)“On p.12 there was a BD and VGIs but no F/N. I thought if I carry on the pc may get acognition. So I carried on but his indicators got worse and worse and the TA started rising. - I hadto end session as it became too late to carry on.” (Data, red.)“Next C/S: (Solution, blue.)1) In your last session, did you go past an EP?

(References: C/S Series No.25; definition of “CSW” in the Mgmt.Dictionary.)4. The Folder Summary. The actual folder is just a piece of cardboard folded in half, bigenough to accommodate A4 or foolscap size paper (1 to 3 above). Inside its front cover a fewsheets of blank paper are stapled. They are the contents table of the whole folder. Usually it is donein two columns. After each session the auditor makes a short note in it about the date of thesession, the time it took, the actions done and their result and if there was an F/N at EoS (End ofSession) or not. It serves as a brief orientation for the C/S or auditor when he has to study the entirefolder of a pc. From the entries in the Folder Summary the C/S can pick out the dates of thesessions he wants to look at in particular.When the folder becomes too fat, a second one is started. The Folder Summary istransferred to the new folder so that a complete view over all case actions this pc had, is alwayspossible.This system was developed in order to keep an accurate and easily reviewed record of apc’s auditing and case progress, and is particularly useful if problems develop and one has tosearch for past auditing errors, or if a new auditor or C/S is taking over.Session admin becomes very important when one does long actions extending over manysessions. When one looks back over a series of sessions one must always be able to clearly seewhat made one decide to do a certain C/S step. What seems logical at the moment it’s writtendown may appear perfect nonsense when looked at three weeks later. This is bad enough foroneself trying to figure out why one did what one did when one did it; it is even worse for another(the C/S), particularly when he has to handle a great number of cases or just temporarily fills in,because the usual C/S takes a holiday.You can make life easy for your C/S when you keep good admin. He will at a glance beable to see the good and the bad points in your sessions; he will see immediately which of your"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64actions was right and which was wrong. It is your admin which forms the basis of the decisionsyour C/S will make on the case, and for the corrections he may possibly give you.Remember: the C/S can only work from the data you give him! So anything which the pcor his friends tell you between sessions: don’t discuss it and don’t simply dismiss it either. Make anote of it !

Introduction To TheVarious TechniquesLooking at the great number and variety of scientology and dianetic processes, one may getrather confused. Yet below the apparent complexity one actually finds no more than five differenttechniques, and all auditing programs consist of one or a combination of them. They are all derivedfrom the procedures described in “Dianetics”. If one were to reduce their interwoven-ness bysorting them into separate techniques and added the E-meter, one would get the auditing methodsof modern scientology, i.e. of the time after 1968.The techniques gradiently require increasing confront by the pc - and by the auditor. Theyare listed below in the sequence from light to demanding. Using the same question (e.g.: “Do youhave a problem?”) with each technique would cause different things, of increasing intensity, tohappen between the pc and his bank. Which gradient one chooses, depends on the pc’s abilitiesalone. (The following chapters will elaborate this.)Two-Way Communication (2WC): 2WC is the easiest on the pc but doesn’t reach verydeep. A (reading) question is looked at loosely from all sorts of angles; the auditor keeps repeatingthe question in so many different ways, the pc answers; finally it will F/N. The auditor just makessure that the pc doesn’t drift off the subject, but there is no push to get anywhere in particular aslong as one stays within the logical limits of the subject. The auditor may pick up large reads andfollow them up until they have flattened out. The whole objective is to give the pc a chance tovoice all his considerations regarding the subject in question, until he has no more compulsivelyfixated attention on it.Repetitive Technique: In repetitive technique the identical command is repeated over andover again (in the fashion drilled in TR-3). This allows the pc to pick and choose from his track assuits his confront ability best. He takes what comes easily. This technique runs deeper than 2WCbut still comparatively shallow. It is applied in prepchecks. Grades processes and rehabilitation’s.(See appropriate sections.)Narrative: This style was already talked about at length in the chapter on PostulateAuditing. In contrast to repetitive technique, where the pc is free to tell as much about the incidentas he likes, the narrative style would require him to tell the whole incident in detail.Running Chains: Running chains is more demanding in so far as the pc is asked toarrange incidents in a chronological sequence on the timetrack. This is not difficult as long as it isdone on the level of locks; it gets harder with secondaries and engrams. This technique is appliedin running the “earlier similar chains” of rudiments, repair lists or engrams (see appropriatesections).As a general note it should be mentioned that running chains makes the pc believe that hisincidents were arranged on his timetrack in a linear fashion. This is a dangerous illusion! The pcdoes not “go down the time track” when he is running a recall process. He is in present time, andhis case is in present time, too! His case exists to the extent that the pc is creating it under the"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66direction of the auditor. He does not drag it along like a long streamer. (Except for his “chroniccase” which is permanently in restimulation.) And of course, the time track does exist - but as animagined thing only! Not for real! The time track is the result of an agreement one has withoneself and others about what was. Without this agreement it would not exist (Axiom 3).Techniques for Finding a Single Item: To these count “Dating and Locating” and“Listing and Nulling”.a) Dating and Locating (D/L): In searching for the beginning of a particular incident, theauditor wants the pc to find the exact date down to the second and the exact distance down to themillimeter. (The bank does contain data with this degree of precision!) D/L demands a highconfront level from the pc because of its minute exactness. (See the appropriate section.)b) Listing and Nulling (L&N): L&N is the top gradient as it asks for one single item only.The auditor asks a question which is formulated to allow only one item as the correct answer; pcsearches around in his mind and makes a list of items until he comes up with the item and has F/NVGIs. Example: “What ice cream do you like best?” (Question reads.) Pc: “Hm - strawberry, Iguess.” Auditor: “Keep on looking!” Pc: “Vanilla banana - well, in fact. it’s chocolate ! ! “ (Someof these items may have read, others not. The last one, however, has a LFBD and an F/N, the pc isVGIs.) Auditor: “I’d like to indicate to you, chocolate is the correct item. “You couldn’t do thiswith an overcharged pc who has twenty different life areas in restimulation. This is the reason whyL&N appears only in Grade III, IV, and Va, after the case has cooled off. It is possible, though, touse it towards the end of a Life Repair, depending on the confront level of the pc and the auditor’sskill.All of these techniques are a way for the pc to find out precisely what is in his bank, tomake him find the object or person or event or postulate of which he was so far unconscious. Thisis because at a certain point of non-confront or overwhelm he had pushed it out of hisconsciousness. Having found it, he will have a cognition and recognize that “it is a . . .”, hencethe term itsa. Getting the pc to itsa, to have cognitions, is the essential aim of auditing.In the following chapters, the auditing processes most commonly used in Life Repairs andin the Solo-Assists (after Clear) will be presented. They appear in the order of increasing difficultyfor the auditor: Prepchecks, Repair Lists, Rudiments, Rehabilitation’s, Date/Locate. They demanda comment as the relevant HCOBs do not cover all the questions students usually have. This is notthe case for Two-Way Comm, engram running and L&N, as the HCOBs on them speak forthemselves. (See the index of Vol.X, XI and XII for references. )Important Note: To be fully prepared for the following chapters (4.1 - 4.5), to be wellacquainted with the fundamentals of theory and procedure, you must have thoroughly studied thechapter on Postulate Auditing! It contains as well comments on the use of 2WC, narrative, runningchains and repetitive technique."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"674.1 The PrepcheckTHE PROCEDUREThe prepcheck could be described as a tool which serves to bring clarity to a confused areaof thought, using a rather broad approach. It compares to a scanning searchlight rather than to asurgical laser.“Prepcheck” means “preparatory check” [2]. The first prepcheck bulletins appear in 1962.The technique was then used for quite different purposes than today. Today’s style was firstsummarized two years later, in HCOB 14 August 1964, and only fourteen years later brought in itsfinal form (HCOB 7 Sept 1978).1. The buttons, the item and the prefix: The prepcheck consists of twenty “buttons”, forexample “suppressed”, “invalidated”, “careful of”, “suggested” . These buttons are used inrelation to a charged reading item found previously, for example during an interview or an earliersession. As this item is called newly with each command, it serves as a ‘ prefix” to the command.2. Repetitive style auditing: Supposing “apples” were the item, you’d use “apples” as aprefix and ask the pc: “On apples, has anything been suppressed?” The question reads. The pcanswers; that as well reads. You acknowledge the answer and keep asking the identical questionuntil the pc runs out of answers, which is a flat point, or until there is an F/N, which is the EP onthis particular series of questions on this button . This is called “repetitive style auditing”. Nowyou take up the next button on the list and proceed in exactly the same way.3. Flat points and end phenomena: Some buttons will go flat, others will F/N . The pcwill have small cognitions here and there and say things like: “Now I see! That’s what it is! I neverlooked at it this way before!” And so on. He is doing his itsa. After a while, he will come to a bigitsa, a big cognition, something that disconnects and releases him from the subject as a whole. Hemay say: “Now I get it! Gee! That’s the thing on apples-they are FRUIT! That’s what they are!Wow!” And so on. That’s the EP. That’s when you end off.Some notes on certain details: To increase the pc’s range of answers, clarify all possibleinteractions with regard to the question. Have the pc demonstrate his understanding to you byasking him to push paperclips and pens around on the table. There are quite a number ofcombinations: 1. Did apples suppress him? 2. Did he suppress apples? 3. Did he observe otherssuppressing apples? 4. Did he suppress himself because of apples? 5. Did others suppress himbecause of apples? 6. Did he suppress others because of apples? 7. Did he observe applessuppressing others? 8. Did apples suppress themselves? 9. Did apples suppress each other?Perhaps there are some more combinations. Of course, you don’t ask the pc these questions one byone, but you do want him to have a good and broad understanding of them.When you give the auditing question to the pc, each time you pick up a new button, youdon’t “check” it or “assess” it on the E-meter. You simply ask the pc in a friendly and interestedmanner. If there is no read, you do not check supp/inval/not-is. You don’t check a button on abutton. Instead you ask the pc for an example concerning the question. Have him invent one if"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"68needed to demonstrate his understanding. If it reads now the button is charged, you inform the pcthat this is so, and you run it repetitively to a flat point or F/N. If it goes flat by the pc running outof answers, do not continue questioning him in the desperate effort to get an F/N, as it would forcethe issue - which is never done. There’s no need to push the pc anyway! Should there be anyfurther charge left on any of the buttons, he’ll get it on the next round through. You use as manybuttons as needed to get to the EP. A dozen of them may be enough in one case; in another youmay have to go through the whole lot, all twenty of them, three times.And please, don’t run your repeater style like a robot. Encourage the pc to elaborate and goin further when one answer or the other is accompanied by a big read. Permit your pc to make itsa!The experts amongst the readers will have noticed that the above procedure does notrepresent the suggestions of the latest HCOB mentioned above. This is because these suggestionsdo not prove successful, if followed to the letter. Taking each button separately to F/N cog VGIs,as the bulletin demands, simply does not work. It means forcing the pc who has run out ofanswers, into more answers; it means tight needles and rising TA; it means ignoring that there issuch a thing as a flat point in a process. -Therefore this HCOB is “out-tech” (Tech Dict. ), nomatter if it was written by Hubbard himself or by another (which unfortunately happened all toooften.)GETTING THE ITEMOn the Cl.VIII course Hubbard says that you can do a prepcheck on any area of charge. Itgoes without saying that the more defined an area is, the better it will read and the better yourprepcheck will run.As an example, let us take a pc who mentions a terminal (person, place, thing) or an AESP-item in several places of his interview but only has small reads on it. Added up, they amount to alot of charge, though. Therefore you decide to do a prepcheck on this terminal or item. The firstthing you do in session: ask him what he would call that item just for himself. His name for it. Thiswill pull all the dispersed attention units into one and give you a blowdown. The pc has done anitsa. Now you have a precise target to work on.Example: pc talks about school here and there in the interview. Lots of sF’s. You ask him:“What’s your word for ‘school”’? Your personal description for it?” - Pc says: “Thatmadhouse!”. laughs, BD. Now you do your prepcheck on “that madhouse”, because this is whatthe big restimulator behind the actual school was. Why the pc calls it a “madhouse”, exactly wherethe charge is coming from - whether it is a past-life overwhelm or a present-life suppressive teacher- will be discovered in session.Which means: even before you start the action of prepchecking you have an item and youknow that it is charged . The prepcheck does not serve to find out if an item is charged. It is not anassessment to find out which button is charged the most. Not at all. It offers twenty angles (the 20buttons) to get at a known charge and blow it. It serves as a tool to “crack” a charged subject.Two further solutions concerning the above situation, for the professional and more stylish:pc talks about school, teachers, good and bad marks, homework etc. You don’t know what out of"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"69all this is the real button. When you are good at Listing & Nulling you could ask: “Who or whatwould represent school to you?” Answer: “The maths teacher!” This item blows down and F/N’s.Now you can do a prepcheck on it. -And there is yet another L & N approach: “Regarding school,who or what would have these difficulties?” Answer: “A dumb boy!” plus LFBD F/N VGIs .That’s the valence he is stuck in . Prepcheck that . (See the chapter “Listing & Nulling” for furtherdetails.)THE END PHENOMENONThe EP of a prepcheck is a release, no matter how many buttons it took. In order to gorelease it takes a number of key-outs. (See Tech Dict. under “Release”.) Some buttons willproduce a key-out with a realization and an F/N, others will just go flat. - Neither the realizationnor the F/N have to be particularly spectacular. They are on the particular button you have beenworking on, not on the item as a whole . The final cognition will be big and on the item as such;and the F/N will be wide. That is the EP.So you don’t have to F/N each button. You run it till there’s no read and no answer left onit. You run it flat. Should it F/N, that’s fine . You carry on, run the remaining buttons to flat or F/N,start again with the first button, go through the lot again and again, till the EP occurs. You just runeach button, whether it has F/Ned on the run before or not. If it has already F/Ned it may readagain as it has restimulated another lock connected with the subject. Remember, it’s a lock action,and there is no end to the number of locks. (See Tech Dict.: “Reduce” “flat”, “flat by TA”, “flatcomm lag”, “flat point”, “flat process” . )These are the prepcheck buttons (quoted from HCOB 7 September 1978 R, “ModernRepetitive Prepchecking”,Vol.XI, p. 469):SuppressedEvaluatedInvalidatedCareful ofDidn’t revealNot-isedSuggestedMistake been madeProtestedAnxious aboutDecidedWithdrawn fromReachedIgnoredStatedHelpedAlteredRevealedAssertedAgreed with"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"70THE PREPCHECK COMBINED WITHPOSTULATE AUDITINGSituation: You realize that a lot of charged items in the pc’s life are connected with her 2nddynamic (sex and family), such as: a) her first husband, b) his parents who own the local shopwhere she can’t help buying things although she doesn’t like to because of their snide remarks, c)her current husband with whom she shares a company that isn’t doing well because of hissloppynes, d) his parents who she hates but has to put up with as they live together in the samehouse, e) her lover who runs a company that’s doing business with her husband’s company andwhom she therefore has on the phone a lot. (Actual example.)So what to do? What is the king pin here which would make the whole constructioncollapse if one pulled it out? Hard to say. This is where a prepcheck comes in handy, done incombination with lock-scanning. As an analogy, the prepcheck functions as a metal detector orGeiger counter. It’s for horizontal action, for sweeping. You search the area; when you get a bigread you dig down to the lode. For digging down you use lock-scanning. That’s the vertical action.If one were to describe prepcheck-procedure in terms of the basic techniques mentionedbefore, one would get the following steps: one starts out with a 2WC (which in this case wasalready done in the interview) in order to generally discuss the subject. Then the actual prepcheckfollows, based on repetitive technique. During the prepcheck you find a “hot button” and ask thepc to tell you the corresponding incident in the narrative style. To then go down deep and find thebasic incident you would use lock-scanning, which relates to the basic technique of running chains.To continue with the above example: you do a prepcheck “on the 2D”. You run three orfour buttons to flat point, all rather uneventful. Next button: “has a mistake been made?” Suddenlypc gets tears in her eyes when she says, yes, both of her marriages were a mistake. Big reads. Sohere is your area, here you can dig in. Instead of TR-3ing the button you have her tell you how andwhen this mistake was made. How did she meet the first and later the second husband, how didshe get to know them, when exactly did she decide to marry them? You get a postulate like “I justhad to have him” . There is a good read on it, yet no relief, no F/N. The beginning, therefore, mustbe deeper down the track. “First time you made that postulate?” Lockscan to present time. You gothrough all of her friends and lovers; still no EP. Got to be earlier. Ah! - she just had to have thebody she’s in now. A prenatal incident. Lockscan to present time. That still isn’t it . ‘ Earlier?” -‘Past life?” - Bingo ! - Egypt ! She “had to have” the priest, seduced him, was found out; thenthey both got ritually executed. But she never as-ised the postulate, so of course she kept going onit! Now that she has as-ised it she laughs, big cognition on the 2D, F/N. (This in the secondsession; pc never ran past lives before.)This was definitely not all of the EP yet. There’s more awry on this 2nd dynamic. So youcontinue your prepcheck down the list of buttons and keep doing the above anytime you get a hotanswer. At the end the pc will tell you that her 2nd dynamic looks all different to her, that her pastdoes not have a grip on her any more and that she feels positive about her future. This would be avery nice EP for the prepcheck as such. Additionally you may now clean up all the postulatesfound, by repeater technique, i.e. in the style of Postulate Auditing."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"714.2 The Repair ListORIGIN AND PURPOSEA repair list (or correction list) is used when something goes wrong in session. It helps theauditor to find the source of the trouble. (See “Correction List”, Tech.Dict.) It consists of a numberof questions which lay down a barrage to shoot anything which may have contributed to thesession getting stuck. This may have been due to auditor mistakes, to unexpected maneuvers of thebank, or to so far unknown peculiarities of the pc.The auditor “assesses the list”, i.e. he reads it line by line from top to bottom in a goodquestioning tone of voice (“assessment TR-1”) and notes down the reads. During the assessment,the pc does not speak. Only when the auditor takes up a reading question, does the pc talk about it.Most questions are handled earlier-similar style, others demand the assessment of yet another repairlist.About half a dozen repair lists are in use; some of them are of a general nature, othersspecifically aim at repairing certain auditing rundowns. Since the late seventies, it is quitecustomary for a professional auditor to whip out one or more repair lists whenever there is a spot oftrouble in the session. As the handling of some repair lists demands yet other repair lists, you canimagine what a mess of incomplete cycles is created that way much to the suffering of the pc.Instead of live communication with the pc, the repair list had become the “universal solvent” forthe C/S and the auditor.The attitude is: the pc has a case, or even IS a case, he has no idea of the Tech, he is in factwholly incapable. This results more often than not in the C/S and the auditor trying to “handle” acase directly, whilst leaving the pc out of the game. Auditing is not done with the pc but for thepc. Under these circumstances the auditing comm cycle cannot go in at all, the needle gets dirty,the TA rises and sticks - time for yet another repair list .Ten years earlier, in the late sixties, there were no prefabricated solutions. Repair lists didnot replace the thinking of the auditor or C/S yet. The review auditor had to study the folder andput his own repair rundown together by working out the right questions for this pc at this time. Thewhole wisdom of the ClassVIII tapes was brought to bear. When you watched one of therepresentatives of the “old days” work, it would look like this: He gets his data from the pc folderand maybe from an interview done additionally; then he analyses the structure of the case, writes athesis of several pages about it and derives the necessary auditing commands from it. He uses norepair list as far as he can avoid it. His viewpoint is: how can I get this thetan in comm with hiscase so he can handle it? And all it takes him to do it are the simple tools Hubbard mentions in theClassVIII course: two-way comm, ruds, rehabs, prepchecks, and engram running.A possible explanation for the increased use of repair lists may be that the CofS underwentsuch a rapid expansion in the early seventies that there weren’t enough repair specialists of ClassVIII rank for each org. To become a ClassVIII auditor one had to be OTIII - a then rarely attainedadvanced auditing level which made the applicants even more scarce. Repair lists, apparently, werethe solution to the problem. Now each Class IV auditor suddenly was in the position to do the"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"72repairs for which formerly one would have needed to be a Class VIII Review Auditor. (Note thatat that time, in 1971, Hubbard started issuing the C/S-Series in the attempt to communicateClassVIII knowledge to Class IV C/Ses, or, in different words: in the attempt to water down aknowledge which really belongs to the level of OTIII, to render it harmless enough and digestible,to a non-OT III C/S. - SeeVol.X for the complete C/S-Series.)THE L1C AND HOW TO USE ITThe L1C needs mentioning separately because it is quite a helpful tool for the beginningauditor. It is assessed like any other list but the handling of the individual lines needs no particularinstruction. They are all taken E/S (earlier similar) to F/N. In other repair lists you find specifichandling instructions for each line which makes them more difficult to master.Here is the procedure: you assess the list on the pc line by line with a good questioningassessment TR-1. In “Method 3” you take up each reading question as you come to it; in “Method5” you assess the whole list once through and then take up the reads in order of their size. Eitherway: invite the pc to talk about the reading line, get his itsa and go E/S when there is no F/N. It isimportant that not only the question itself reads, but also the pc’s answer! When this is not so youmay wind up in nowhere-land as you attempt to go earlier/similar: the pc doesn’t recall any earlierincidents and the TA climbs up and up. No completed cycle of action. Why? Because it wasn’tstarted right to begin with. Very unpleasant for all concerned.Usually the list is done “on something”, for example on an item which has come uppreviously in an earlier session or interview. This is called a “prefix”. “On the time you went toschool, is there (LlC line)?” - Or: “On Joe, is there . . .?” - Or: “On the second dynamic . . .?”When no special terminal is used as a prefix one usually prefixes with “Recently . . .?” or “In yourlife . . .?”It is important that the prefix reads well else your list will be a very joyless affair for both pcand auditor. The prefix should be a terminal (person, place, thing, subject), a timespan or anactivity - not an AESP-item. On AESP-items you had best run the underlying engram; on terminalsetc. you can run ruds or L1Cs.The following basic techniques are used in an L1C: a question has read; to start with, theauditor discusses it briefly with the pc (2WC) until an incident is found. Then the pc recalls theincident in full detail (narrative) . When this does not lead to a key-out with F/N one goes E/S (chains), goes over the earlier incident in the narrative style, goes E/S, etc. Take your time! Reducethe charge on each incident by going over it repeatedly, before going earlier/similar. (Have a lookat the procedure diagrams in the appendix.)And please: do not expect an instant read on the question: “Is there an earlier similarproblem?” (Or whatever the L1C-line may be . ) It doesn’t have to read now as it already readwhen you originally checked the command for charge. And that original read came from the basicon the chain. Now when the L1C-line doesn’t F/N on the first incident the pc told you, is there anE/S? Of course there is, whether it reads or not! You know it when you understand your basics.THE END PHENOMENON"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"73A list is continued as long as there is non-confront or compulsive attention on the prefixeditem. The EP is cognition on the terminal in question, VGIs, F/N. Of course, each line by itself istaken to F/N, too, but these are only sub-EPs. The final EP is on the whole thing. This may occurafter just a few lines or it may require that you take the pc through the whole list a number of times.Sometimes the C/S wants to be dead-certain that there’s no scrap of charge left on the subject inquestion and orders “an L1C to F/Ning list” . He wants to see an F/N on each line. This isaccomplished by first taking up each line which reads straight away and taking it to F/N, and thenchecking the remaining lines by means of the three buttons (suppressed, invalidated, not-ised)which will either cause a read or an F/N. Otherwise the three buttons are not used on a repair listunless there are no reads at all. (Which raises the question of whether the assessment-TRs of theauditor are any good, or if the C/S perhaps didn’t take the wrong approach to the case. )(You can find an L1C in Vol. III, p. 203.)"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"744.3 The Rudiments“Rudiment, n. 2. A first or elementary principle of any art or science; as, the tenents ofgeometry.” -Webster’s Student Dictionary, 1943.With respect to auditing, the “elementary principles” of the definition above are containedin the six session rudiments: ARC break (ARCX), problem, missed withhold, overt, evaluation andinvalidation. (For the theory of rudiments, see Volume 1, Part Two.)When you, as the auditor. begin a session, you ideally would like to see an F/N. It meansthat the pc’s attention is on nothing in particular; he is not distracted by anything and is ready topay attention to the auditing command you are going to give him. His “rudiments are in”. Incontrast to this, anyone who is sad, has a problem, a bad conscience from having done somethinghe considers naughty, feels criticized or degraded, won’t be any good at concentrating on the taskahead - such as an auditing process, for example. For this reason you have “to put the ruds in onthe pc”. The difficulties of life made the pc’s “ruds go out”; now you “put them in”. The usualC/S-instructions for this are: “Fly a rud if no F/N at session start”, or: “Fly six ruds to F/N”. In theformer case the ruds are gone through in sequence and the first reading one is taken to F/N. Thenone goes on to the main process for this session. In the latter case all ruds are repeatedly gonethrough in sequence till each one has an F/N. Only then does one go on to the main process. Afurther possibility would be to assess all six rudiments and handle them in the sequence of theirchargedness.Taking rudiments to F/N handles locks, i.e. present time key-ins, and thereby disengagesthe pc’s attention from his life worries. In the Tech Dict. it says that rudiments are not auditing, butonly serve to get the pc in session. This is only so, when you “fly a rud” at the start of a session inorder to get an F/N. (“To fly a rud” means you take it to F/N.) However, when you put ruds in ona whole item or terminal, you get an actual repair rundown which is definitely auditing. (Forreferences on ruds, see “Rudiments, Definition and Patter”, HCOB 11.8.1978, Vol.XI)A note to the expert: This strategy of “first ruds then the major process” can be justifiablyargued about. When the pc, at the start of his auditing program, comes in all weighed down by hisproblems, one cannot expect him to F/N. If one were to audit his ruds now just for the sake ofgetting an F/N, it would be mere “cosmetics” . One wouldn’t have done more than brush off a fewlocks. One may have even kept the pc from saying what’s really troubling him!The pc has the natural urge to speak of nothing but his main difficulties. No matter whetherone uses rudiments or any of the other processes described later, the main point is to work alwaysin the center of the pc’s attention. As even the rudiments may serve this purpose, it would elevatethem to the rank of “major process”! Which wouldn’t be a merely superficial cosmetic treatmentbut go right down to the core of the case.The separation between ruds and major process therefore seems fairly arbitrary, at leastwith regard to a Life Repair. At a later stage when the pc is in pretty good shape anyway - e.g. onthe Grades 0-IV or a special rundown - the ruds would certainly be useful as a session preparation."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"75”NORMAL” RUDIMENTSNormal rudiments refer to a present time situation: an ARCX, a problem, a mw/h, an overt,an invalidation or an evaluation. The basic pattern of the procedure is: you ask the ruds question,e.g. “Have you committed an overt?”, get a read, and get the data from the pc. No F/N on thisone: go earlier similar: “Is there an earlier similar overt?” Along the timetrack, earlier similarsituations are arranged on a chain. As the pc goes down the chain the auditor makes sure he saysall there is to each incident; finally there will be a key-out and an F/N. This is the correct EP,because in flying rudiments you are dealing with lock chains, not with engram chains, whichwould demand an erasure. In rudiments, the application of the basic techniques is similar to theL1C: a short 2WC - narrative (except for ARCXs as they are assessed see further down) - runningchains.When the pc has a high TA you don’t fly his ruds. Why? Because something is already inrestimulation. You don’t need to free his attention from present time concerns in order so that youcan then restimulate some part of his bank with a process it’s happened already, so you find what itis and handle it. For this, the rudiment questions are not useful. (See the section on High TA.)As we have already pointed out concerning the L1C, one can make a fatal mistake at thepoint of picking up a reading question and when one goes E/S. As one picks up a reading questionone must make very sure that the answer of the pc reads, too, otherwise one risks running anuncharged item and cannot complete the cycle of action. With regard to going earlier/ similar, onecan often observe auditors rushing down rudiment chains by going E/S much to soon. This waythe charge on the incident being run will not be reduced sufficiently. He will have trouble lookingover the “hump” of the accumulated unhandled charge and - after a while - find no further E/Sincidents. The chain goes dead with no F/N, rising TA and a hopeless auditor.Remember the old rule of itsa. You must always get the PC to say what IT is.(“Oh-it’s-a-so-and-so!”) This way you get the exact consideration, the exact time, place, form and event.Don’t take just everything the pc says for an answer. Think of the definition of TR 3: onlyacknowledge when you have received an answer directly to the question; never acknowledgeanything else. So: what exactly IS the problem? The W/H? The overt? The evaluation? Theinvalidation? - Get his “itsa” and you will get a good read on it. If it does not F/N, you’ll get yourF/N on an earlier similar one.An ARCX is a restimulation of a loss (a secondary). When the pc is ARC-broken, he isangry or sad about something. Get what person, place or subject he is ARC-broken with. Keep itshort. Then assess the ARCX, get the point which reads the most and indicate it to the pc. “Is it abreak in Affinity - Reality - Communication - Understanding ?” Usually he brightens up on theindication. Continue by assessing Curious - Desired- Enforced - Inhibited - No - Refused on thepoint found. (To refresh your memory, see the beginning of Part Two in the previous book or in[1].) Supposing the biggest read on the previous assessment had been on “Reality”, you wouldask: “Regarding this ARCX, were you curious about a reality?” “Was there a desired reality?”And so on. Find the most charged point on this assessment, too, and indicate it to the pc.Now that you have found and indicated what it is (“an enforced reality”), the pc’s ARC isto some degree re-established. Have him look at the incident in terms of what you indicated to him,"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"76and he will have cognition’s. He never looked at it this way. He thought it was a “desired reality”but thinking that obviously didn’t help him. So obviously the assessment serves as a fast way to getthe exact “what” of the ARCX. To continue, you go E/S to F/N, or - should the pc have had thisARCX for a while already - you handle it by Long Duration technique (see below) .Slow ARCX-assessment by TA: New PC’s usually have a hard time following theARCX assessment. They haven’t understood the concepts involved and so you possibly won’t getany reads. Doing a slow assessment by TA (E-Meter Drill 23) makes it really easy on the pc andhe gets grooved in on the procedure at the same time. You have him originate on each point of theA-R-C-U and the CD-E-I-N-R-assessment, note all reads, and after each assessment indicate thebiggest reading point to him. After a few times through this slow procedure the pc will now beready to follow the rapid assessment, with good reads. (No concept = no reads. -The other reasonfor no reads of course is: your TR-1 is too weak.)In contrast to the ARCX the problem is talked about, and very much so, in the 2WC-part ofthe handling, until one has found out what really is the matter. (This is done as well with all thefollowing rudiments.)The auditor must be careful not to mix up all those difficulties the pc is tellinghim about, with the actual problem beneath it all. When he falls into this trap, he will believe thathe has all the data now and go E/S much too soon. In everyday language it is quite customary tocall any difficulty a “problem”, but in technical terms we have to differentiate very carefullybetween the two. A difficulty is nothing but an obstacle one has to overcome. As long as one ishigh-spirited and believes in one’s success, there are (technically speaking) no problems. Thecounter-intentions of others or the mest-universe are never a problem. Only when one begins todoubt oneself or the possibility of winning (2nd postulate), does a problem arise: in the form ofindecision, withdraw and standstill.It is therefore the task of the auditor to peel the actual problem out of the difficulties the pcwill tell him about. What was the pc’s intention when he set out to do a certain thing, and what isthe intention he agreed to when he decided to stop doing this thing or decided to do somethingelse? Note that both postulates are the pc’s. A counter-intention may seemingly come from theenvironment or a terminal, but in fact what you are looking at is an agreement made by the pc withthe source of the counter-intention (Dn Axiom 118). It’s strictly 2nd postulate counter 1st postulate.Example: Father says: “No, you don’t go to the movies before you are grown up.” Son is6 years old when this is said; now - at the time of the session - he is 35 years old and still doesn’tgo to the movies. What counter-postulate did he form against his own wish that kept him fromgoing to the movies up to the present day? - It’s not what the father said. It’s what he made uphimself to agree with it!When you have established what the problem is and didn’t get an F/N, you go E/S.THE MISSED WITHHOLD AND THE OVERTHubbard had a lot to say about this subject. It’s a whole philosophy on ethics and personalintegrity. For the purpose of this text we will keep to the practical side of handling mw/h’s andoverts. Should anyone wish more detailed information on this subject beyond what was said in PartTwo, he is encouraged to consult the index of Vol.X or study “Academy Level II”."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"77Overts and w/hs are run the same way because both have in common that a) somethingwas done or, respectively, withheld, and b) that the person wonders if he’s been found out or not.So there are two sections each for handling overts or withholds, with the emphasis on section a).Section b) is not always the case. After all, there are overts and withholds where you never feltfound out afterwards and didn’t have to develop a bad conscience regarding anyone. Except foryourself perhaps: anytime you thought of it.Re a): You must get all of the w/h or the overt; that’s the ethics part of it. What has heDONE; time, place, form (the circumstances of the incident), and event (the actual sequence in theincident, what effect was caused, what the consequences were, what harm was done). Oneimportant aspect of looking at “event” as “consequences” is the possibility of examining harmdone and whether in fact any harm was done! Too often whether something is an overt is acceptedfrom someone else’s evaluation of it, e.g. the morals of one’s parents or society. So the auditing ofoverts should specifically include the opportunity to realize this. (The question: “In what way wasthat actually an overt?” can start this re-evaluation very effectively.) Where it is really an overt,looking at “event” as outcome, harm caused, encourages an examination of the ethics of it moreimmediately.Omitting this differentiation would certainly bring about the “false reads” often observed inthis context (when it was not an overt), or a particular w/h may always come up again and again,although it has “F/Ned” already (when the pc never had the opportunity to re-evaluate thesupposed overt).There is no “system” to it. It takes asking curious questions and relying on your E-meterand not acknowledging before the whole thing has become clear to you as the auditor. And youmust get all of the facts - only then will the pc have confronted his own responsibility for the overtand w/h. So when it looks as if the pc had said all, you ask: “Is that all of it?”, and you want to geta read there. When the pc says “yes” and it is true, there should be another read there. When thereis a read on only one of the two possibilities, that is still good enough. If neither of the two readyou know you haven’t got all yet. If you’d now go E/S, you’d soon be in trouble: charge wasrestimulated and has been left behind: it will blur the earlier similar incidents and the chain will notcome to an end.Re b): You must get who missed it, who almost found him out, who caused him a badconscience. “Who almost found out about what you did?” “Who made you feel he knew it?” Pc:“Joe”. Auditor: “And what did Joe do that made you think he knew?”This is the social aspect of it; it’s cleaning up the pc’s ARCXs which formed on the basisof his mw/h or overt. In the first part you get the facts, in the second part you get who missed it.Always bear in mind: ‘“All ARCXs stem from missed withholds.” This principle leads to animportant application: it allows the auditor to start from an ARCX and trace it right down to theunderlying mw/h and overt, without taking the ARCX to an F/N first! He would get the pc “todive straight through”, as it were. (See the chapter “Integrity”, section 10, in [17]; as well HCOB30.11.1978, “Confessional Procedure”,Vol.XII)And mind you: don’t make the pc feel bad by a stem face or reproachful tone of voice,because of his withholds and overts! Stay calm and factual. Get the subjective rightness in them."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"78Despite the wrongness of the overt or the w/h there were rightnesses. He didn’t talk about hisdeeds as this would have endangered his self preservation. That’s a rightness. (See definition ofw/h in the Tech Dict.) He committed the overt because he was sitting on a misunderstood word -such as a set of false, uninspected values - which made it right to do what he did (see “cycle of anovert”, Tech Dict.). Or it is a datum held in high esteem by him - and in fact, on inspection it turnsout to have been received through a method called “teaching by engrams”. It was father beatingup Jonny whilst speaking wise words. Father is of course out of valence himself at this time, andmakes himself the mouthpiece of his bank. This way father makes sure that his bank is properlytransferred to the next generation. It’s not in the blood, as folk wisdom has it. It’s in the bank!Not only through the application of fatherly violence can Jonny pick up father’s valenceand along with it uninspected attitudes, but as well through his admiration for father. Jonny may,for example, wind up one day at court for repeated theft in department stores. “Why did yousteal?”, asked the judge. “They have plenty of them anyway!”, says Jonny. End of hearing. Theauditor would ask: “And where does this idea come from?” In the end it turns out that father once,when Jonny was three years old, had taken a few apples from the farmer’s apple tree withoutpermission, and mother had said: “But William! You can’t do that!” Whereupon he shruggedmagnanimously, took a bite with relish from a stolen apple, and said: “They have plenty of themanyway!” Who was the winner here? Father. Whom did Jonny admire? Father. Whose valence didhe take on? Father’s, of course. Mother didn’t make herself heard successfully, so she was theloser.As a further possibility there is of course the combination of the above with a real implant,which makes the whole matter even harder to resolve. The common denominator is, in any case,that the pc sits on a false datum, is identified with the source of it, has gone out of valence to it andcommits any amount of overts on that basis which he has no trouble at all justifying.Naturally, none of these justifications make the overts or w/hs right. But they help theauditor to understand the pc! And that’s his job, after all. The real and only overt, by the way, ishaving violated one’s own integrity by making a 2nd postulate. That’s contra-survival againstoneself to start with, but later spreads out over all of the dynamics. When you have dug as deep asthat, your pc will have some big cognition’s!(See the definitions of “W/H” and “Cycle of an Overt” in the Tech Dict., as well of“Murder Routine”.)INVALIDATION AND EVALUATIONInval and Eval are the easiest ones on both pc and auditor. Just itsa and E/S itsa. But don’tsell them off cheaply ! Self-inval is the bottom line to the whole case ! If he hadn’t violated hisintegrity he wouldn’t have committed the overt of forming a 2nd postulate and not gotten into thepredicament of withholding it from others and himself. And that’s the point where the thetan startsdigging his own grave!As usual, do get a reading itsa on both inval and eval before you go earlier similar.(See the appendix for a schematic graph on the handling of rudiments. )"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"79RUDIMENTS OF LONG DURATION (LD RUDS)LD Ruds refer to a situation which has “always been like this”, “all my life”, “never beenany different”, etc. The attention of the pc is not on a present time situation but on a time span ofconsiderable magnitude.Here one cannot simply go E/S after a few words about the matter. That would be too fast;it wouldn’t be in proportion to the magnitude of the charge. Instead, one must find out whenexactly the specific out-rud situation began. So instead of asking for “E/S?” one asks for and getsthe earlier beginning (“E/B”), lockscans to PT, asks for yet another earlier beginning and another,each time lock-scanning to PT, until one has found the exact beginning of the situation. (“I alwayshad money problems, all my life, and it started when I got my first pocket money and it wasn’tenough to buy a lollipop with.”) This will result in great relief for the pc, followed by a BD andperhaps an F/N.When you do not get an F/N at this point you must decide whether you want to go about itthoroughly or just quickly finish it off with a simple key-out. In the latter case it would be enoughto Date/Locate this moment, to F/N. (This process is described in a later section.) In the former,you would have to continue lock-scanning till the pc has found the basic, and then let him run thatincident narratively until it is erased and the postulate in it found.It is not recommended to ask for an “E/S out-rud of LD?” as that would get you into adifferent postulate chain. Each LD out-rud describes a unique situation, really, and should behandled as such, i.e. by analyzing its specific postulate structure.When the auditor, in running normal ruds, gets originations from the pc which indicate LDRuds are out, he of course switches over to the LD-method.When the auditor has a specific C/S to do LD Ruds, the command would be for example:“Do you have an ARCX of long duration?” - or: “Is there a problem you have had for a very longtime?”LD RUDS AND FINDING POSTULATESLD Ruds, as we have seen, are an excellent way to dig up basics and the postulatescontained within them. These can then be worked on further in the style of Postulate Auditing. LDRuds therefore go way beyond the scope of normal rudiments which are designed to merely keyout currently troublesome situations. The procedure of finding postulates is now shown in detail:ARCX: First get its beginning, assess it at the time of the beginning and indicate to the pcwhat you found, then have the pc look over his time track at all later similar items (e.g. “a refusedaffinity”) with lock scan procedure. It may even go down to an earlier beginning now. Find outwhat he thought, decided, postulated or intended at the very moment when his affinity was refused.This way you get the 2nd postulate."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"80Problem: Get what he wants (1st postulate) and what exactly keeps him from doing it; findout when this happened the first time (exact beginning) and then peel the exact thought out of thebasic incident which made him agree that it wasn’t possible to get or do what he wanted (2ndpostulate).Missed Withhold: Get as much of the w/h as is easily available to the pc, trace it back toits beginning, all the while getting more and more of the w/h until you have it ALL. Then find outhow withholding what he did aided his survival. Now you have the 2nd postulate, the “rightness”consideration. This may F/N.Then, even after the F/N, look for who missed it. This is an entirely different matter: it’s theARCXs which occurred as a consequence of the w/h. Lockscan these ARCXs and get an F/N onthis, too. (Quite often the pc will tell you who missed it even whilst talking about the actual w/h;therefore the “missed”-part may be no more than a mop-up of bits left over from before.)Overt Get what he did, trace it back to the first time. Find out from him how committingthe overt was a solution to a problem. Then have the pc find out how doing what he did wentagainst his own integrity; how it was wrong by his own standards. (It must be, else there wouldn’tbe any charge.) Don’t buy any hogwash about morals and “everybody thinks”. That’s not theovert. It’s how he violated his own principles, maxims or policies - whether they were invented byhim personally, or adopted by him from others, doesn’t matter, as long as he considered them hisown. And then find out what went through his mind when he did it - that’s his 2nd postulate; that’sthe overt. Perhaps you can even find out whose idea he had taken over there, i.e. into whosevalence he went then.Eval/lnval: Easy. Find the earliest time the pc received the particular evaluation orinvalidation, then ask him what he thought of himself at that moment, and you have your 2ndpostulate.NORMAL RUDS: THEIR LIABILITYNormal ruds may very easily lead over into ruds of long duration, because the present timerestimulation of the normal rud may not be a “first ever” concerning the situation in question. Hehas an ARCX with his aunt, ok, but is it the first time? No, he’s always had trouble with his aunt.So it may soon go into LD, either immediately or after once or twice going E/S.Now supposing it were really the first time he has an ARCX with his aunt, you’d of coursehandle it by assessment and then go E/S. Now here is the difficulty: what does earlier similarmean? Well, you may say, similar is whatever the pc considers so. Good. But this may lead youanywhere! Going E/S contains the liability of the pc going “by association”. He may wind up innowhere-land, find nothing earlier and feel generally bored with the whole thing. (With the TAcreeping up and up.) He is going earlier, yes, but what is the logical thread? What’s holding thechain together? Against what is the similarity measured? As there is not a clearly defined Attitude,Emotion, Sensation or Pain (AESP), auditor and pc may not necessarily know what to relate to.Let us stay with the example of the aunt and suppose it were a “refused affinity”. So whatis the pc to do as he goes earlier similar? He is clearly not intended to just find an earlier similar"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"81incident of “refused affinity” as the next auditing command asks him to find a new ARCX, anearlier similar one, which is assessed newly.The definition of “ITSA” presents the answer to this theoretical dilemma. As soon as thepc has found the exact ARCX (or whatever the rud may be), as soon as he has found exactly whatit is, he will have a stable datum to work from when he goes E/S. This may occur after the ARCX-assessment, too. You have found, by assessment, that it is a “refused affinity” . You haveindicated the charge on it to the pc. The pc does not brighten up particularly. So you ask him tolook at this ARCX in terms or “refused affinity” and to tell you about it. Now he will discover anaspect which so far has escaped his attention, he will really brighten up and say: “That’s it! That’sthe moment when I felt really upset! The moment I was giving her the present and she just snarledat me! I felt totally refused.” At this moment the whole thing makes sense to the pc. He has madethe data found in the assessment come alive for himself. And now he will know what to look forwhen you give him the E/S command. So do take the time to get a proper itsa.REPETITIVE RUDSThe C/S-instruction: “Repetitive Ruds till they F/N on call” means that you fly six ruds(“on life” or on a particular item), each to F/N. Then you run them again. This time some will F/N“on call”, i.e. they F/N right after giving the command, without even a read. Then you run thesequence a third time, omitting those which have F/Ned on call on the run before, to forego anover-run. (An O/R means going on too long, past the end phenomenon.) Continue this way untilthey have all F/Ned on call.”FALSE” RUDSFurther up, in the section on the E-meter, the subject of “false reads” was mentioned. It’sthe read you get because the pc feels invalidated or evaluated by the question, or that your questionrestimulates evaluation/invalidation of LD because he’s been asked the same stupid question somany times before. (“You look so worried - anything wrong?”, when he actually feels fine.) Itmeans the person received a false indication by the one asking the question.If this happened many times to someone throughout his life he will develop the generalfeeling that nobody understands him and he will feel uncomfortable with people as they keepmisinterpreting how he actually feels. To handle this case-situation, you just fly 6 “false” ruds onhim, repetitively till they F/N on call. “Did anyone say/think/assume you had a (rud) when youdidn’t have one?” Run per E/S or LD; whatever applies best. As a result, the pc will feel veryrehabilitated regarding his social life. (This is also very valuable as a clean up of past bad auditing -which unfortunately does happen not infrequently.)REVERSE RUDSThis is a useful process when you have a pc who lives in a persistent state of panic andoverwhelm because he thinks “they are after me to get me”. You just reverse the ruds flow and"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"82make him confront what people are actually thinking about him. “Does anyone have an ARCXwith you? A problem with you? A w/h from you? An overt on you? Feel evaluated/invalidated byyou?” Run per E/S or LD as suits the situation best. This cleans up the pc’s considerations abouthis social field like you wouldn’t believe.FLOWS AND QUAD RUDSIn auditing, the action of theta (reaching and withdrawing) is looked at in terms of fourflows, i.e. the flow of mest particles or attention units from one terminal to the other. Flow one (F-1) is the inflow or motivator, flow two (F-2) the outflow or overt, flow three (F-3) the flowbetween two people with oneself being the witness; flow zero (F-0) goes from oneself back tooneself in circular fashion (therefore “zero”).The “quad” in “Quad Ruds” means “quadruple”, “fourfold”. When the C/S orders QuadRuds to be done, you run six ruds on F-1, then on F-2, then on F-3, then on F-0.You could do it asa general action without any prefix to the command, but it works best on a specific highly chargedterminal. Example: F-1:” Does Joe have a (rud) with you?” - F-2: “Do you have a (rud) withJoe?” - F-3A: “Does Joe have a (rud) with others?” - F-3B: “Do others have a (rud) with Joe?” -F-0: “Do you have a (rud) with yourself because of Joe?”This process may be mindblowing; or it may be dead boring. Therefore, use it selectively."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"834.4 Rehabilitation ProcedureAs most students ask the same questions concerning the HCOB 19 December 1980,“Rehab Tech”, one may conclude that this bulletin presents a simple procedure in a confusingway. The following section may serve as a clarification.THE PURPOSE OF A REHABILITATIONRehabilitation directly aims at re-establishing wins and abilities which the pc has lostbecause he went into agreement with an invalidation or suppression. (See Dn Axiom 118.)Theresult of a good rehab is: more certainty for the pc, less self-invalidation and doubt, past purposesunearthed and validated. His succumb postulates have been detected and as-ised; he is again ready“to go for it”.THEORY AND DEFINITIONSArranged on a timetrack, the following three points come in this sequence (from early topresent time): first the key-out - then the release or win - then the key-in. Let us look at this for amoment: the pc has made his 1st postulate (“I want to learn swimming”) . Later some water getsinto his lungs. This is painful (engram) he makes the 2nd postulate (“I’m suffocating”). That’s theabsolute basic. After this, he never goes swimming again and gets a tight feeling in the throat whenhe sees lakes or swimming pools. Then, because of favorable circumstances (friends, nice holiday),he overcomes his fear by his own strength, goes swimming and discovers that he can do it! That isa release. What had to fall away from him to make it possible is the 2nd postulate of “I’msuffocating”. The moment it fell off him: that’s the key-out. For the next few years he manages toswim well; then, one night, he falls out of a rowing boat and panics. And that is the end of hisability to swim. That is the key-in.The above may be interpreted in two ways: either the old 2nd postulate (“I’m suffocating”)- which was just pushed away but never as-ised - came back, or he made a new 2nd postulate(“I’m lost!”) Only the first of the two, strictly speaking, would be a key-in, i.e. a locking-on of analready existing counter postulate; the latter really would be a new GPM on the chain, completewith a newly made counter-postulate. This terminological differentiation, however, is not generallymade. Both of the above versions are usually called a key-in. The key-in is simply the point in timewhen a period of release comes to an end.So, in brief: the point of key-out is defined as something unwanted (a 2nd postulate) goingaway; the point of key-in is defined as something unwanted (the same or another 2nd postulate)coming in on one. The release is the stretch of time when one is in full possession of one’s ability,i.e. when one is working on the basis of one’s 1st postulate. The duration of this variesconsiderably, depending on circumstances."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"84Mind you, although it’s always a postulate which keys in or out the pc will not necessarilybe aware of this. He may give you any amount of AESP-items instead. (“A” items, attitudes, arepostulates, though.) Example: “Suddenly I had this terrible pain in my chest and I couldn’t swimany longer”. Of course, you have to work with what he is giving you, particularly as long as itreads well.There are two distinctly different handlings. There is the key-out variety which works onthe basis of prepcheck technique, and there is the erasure variety which works on the basis ofPostulate Auditing. The key-out variety demands less skill from the auditor and is useful for lightactions, like rehabilitating the EP of a session just after one over-ran it. But when the key-in has ledto deep-seated failed purposes or heavy somatics, the Postulate Auditing variety will be the tool touse.The key-out method is of temporary value only as the pc may key in again when life issufficiently nasty to him. After all, his 2nd postulates were not erased but only destimulated and“switched off”. The plug has been pulled out of the bank. But the bank can plug itself back in onthe basis of the very same 2nd postulates! This of course won’t happen when you have erased the2nd postulates by Postulate Auditing technique. The pc ideally - is down to his 1st postulate andacts and lives by it. All past 2nd postulates have been as-ised. He can’t key in - but he can make anew 2nd postulate when there is more counter-effort in life than he can take. (See “randomity” inDianetic Axiom 144 and others.)THE PROCEDURE BY KEY-OUTIn the actual rehabilitation process you run the three points in question in a differentsequence from how they are arranged on the timetrack: first the release point, then the key-outbefore it, then the key-in after it. Why? - Because the thetan is less interested in his bank than in hisabilities. As the rehab procedure addresses lost abilities, the release obviously holds the mostinterest for the thetan. Rehabilitating the release means putting the pc’s attention on his 1stpostulate. That’s why it is looked at first. With good TRs (TR 2!) and some good luck the processmay already come to an EP as soon as the main point of interest (the release) has been found andacknowledged. No F/N at this point means that the release (i.e. the 1st postulate) is buried undermuch charge accumulated through suppressing, invalidating and not-acknowledging it (all ofwhich are 2nd postulates). A simple acknowledgment of the release apparently is not sufficient tomake the pc overcome this charge. Therefore one has to audit these “three buttons” repetitively.“On the release, has anything been suppressed/invalidated/not acknowledged?” They are notbeing assessed! As in prepchecking, you ask the pc for each one, get your read on the question oron his answer and run it repetitively till it goes flat or F/Ns. As the pc is itsa-ing he is blowingcharge; the release is coming back up to the surface; finally it’s all cleaned up and there is yourF/N. 1st postulate back in full swing.No F/N after the three buttons on the release: there must be more charge elsewhere. Thereare two options for this, two masses the pc has not yet perceived and fully acknowledged: eitherthe mass which fell off him (key-out) and made it possible for him to go release, or the mass whichcame on to him after the release and ended the period of release (key-in). Run your pc throughthese two points, find out exactly what A or E or S or P keyed out or keyed in and discharge it by"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"85use of the buttons. The rehab will come to an EP at either of the two points, with cognition, F/Nand VGIs.When you find the release, key-out or key-in item very heavily charged, running threebuttons only may not be sufficient to reduce the charge. There is no reason why you shouldn’t pullout your list of prepcheck buttons and put in some more buttons in order to help the pc through.One may argue that “suppress, invalidate, not acknowledged” are closely aligned with alter-is andnot-is of Axiom 11 and that one therefore shouldn’t do more than those three buttons. But thisargument doesn’t hold water as all of the 20 prepcheck buttons, too, are built around Axiom 11! Soif it’s ok to do the one it must be ok to do the other as well.Indicating charge: Increase of certainty is achieved by indicating charge to the pc duringthe rehab. It is a form of acknowledgment (TR-2). One has to use it right; when you do it too oftenor unnecessarily the session will slow down and the pc grow impatient. You don’t indicate eachand every read - only when he feels uncertain about something. It makes him get the feeling thathe’s “spot on” with his originations. At the moment that he validates himself for his wins, he willbe bigger and stronger than the bank. -This is the EP, with cognition, VGIs and F/N .Getting the exact item: Without itsa nothing goes during a rehab! -The pc has to originatefully on each item (release, keyout, key-in) until he has said it, till he has hit the bull’s eye. It willbe a postulate or an AESP-item. Here are some typical examples; for the release: “I just knew Icould do it!”; for the key-out: “I lost the feeling that I’m too stupid for this”, or: “suddenly thissadness went away”; for the key-in: “I felt like a zombie and gave up”, “I felt my head wasbursting, so I couldn’t concentrate and failed the exams.” - It’s not what happened: “As I walkeddown the road I felt sort of nice.” That would be a mere situation. You are looking for what hepostulated or felt emotionally or physically, and for the exact formulation of it.You want the exact wording, and that is what you audit the three buttons on. In getting theexact wording the auditor goes for the biggest possible read (ideally LFBD, of course) and paysattention to the indicators of the pc. When the pc has given his itsa down to the exact wordingyou’ll see it on his face and on the needle. And THAT you acknowledge - be it with good TR 2 orwith a formal indication of charge.EP trouble: When you have done all the steps and there is no F/N, you have the pc onceagain look at each item (release, keyout, key-in) . This serves to orient him, particularly when thesession has been long. In a way, you “rehab the session” by doing so.When this doesn’t give you an F/N either, there’s only one possibility left: the release wasovershadowed by an out-rud at the time it occurred (or slightly earlier). This out-rud must befound. So you run as many ruds as needed “concerning the release” until the pc goes VGIs on therelease and the process is complete.Should even that not give you an EP-type F/N, or should the action become unworkable,then you are auditing too late on the chain. There must be an earlier beginning to this release, or anE/S release. Find the E/B or E/S, and do the action on that item. (You ought to have found that outon the initial question: “When was the release point?”, though! When the answer the pc gave thendidn’t read well you could have guessed you were too late. - See further down, “CommandSequence and Patter” .)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"86A note on the EP: Usually the first F/N counts as the EP. The pc has his release back andthat’s enough. You don’t want to push him back into the bank by further auditing. However, if theindicators of the pc aren’t quite so good, and the F/N isn’t quite as wide as you’d expect it fromthis pc, and if the TA is rising after the F/N - then there is still some charge cooking somewhere.So just carry on. Supposing you had - of the three possible points only addressed the release so far,and had got an F/N on a rising TA, one or both of the yet unhandled ones would still need lookingat, or the rudiment steps needs doing, or there is an E/B or an E/S. - Just do the next step in thesequence, and it’ll all clear up.When the pc is VGIs on the whole rehab and says so but the TA is rising right after theF/N, there may be some other O/R (overrun) coming up already, or a protest or a failed purpose.When a short two-way comm does not help you to find out what is going on, you had better endthe session at this point and consult your C/S.REHAB BY KEY-OUT:COMMAND SEQUENCE AND PATTER0. Instruction to the pc: In case of an in-session O/R you simply say: “We are now goingto rehabilitate the point when you felt released on this process. “When you pick up an item fromthe introductory interview, you tell the pc so: “In your interview you mentioned that you feel anoverwhelming sensation of happiness when you listen to music and that you regret that the feelingalways passes away so soon. -We are now going to rehabilitate this state.”1.

No F/N on 4: Check for out-ruds concerning the release.Patter: “Concerning the release, was there:- an ARCX?”- a Problem?”- a missed withhold?”- an overt?”(Run only as many ruds as needed to complete the rehab.)REHAB BY POSTULATE AUDITINGIn many cases a rehab doesn’t just concern a session win (in which case the procedure bykey-out would serve just fine) but touches on deep-seated failed purposes in the pc. As we haveseen, the moment a 2nd postulate is made the lid is put on one’s 1st postulate. This is not a key-in,a relative basic, it’s the absolute basic.In the “rehab by key-out” style you were working on what the pc gave you right away, i.e.on the latest release. You worked with buttons to attain a key-out. In the “rehab by PostulateAuditing” you 1. search for the earliest release the pc can find; 2. get all the postulates whichkeyed out or in; 3. erase all incidents connected with these postulates.1. Pc: “I always wanted to become a concert pianist, but in the end I had to give up on it.”(Failed purpose). -Auditor: “Did you ever go release (or: have any wins) on playing the piano?”(Big read.) - PC (brightens up): “Yes, when I won a contest at school and was awarded the firstprize.” - Auditor has the pc lock-scan all later times when he felt good about playing the piano,asks for E/B and finally gets the first time the pc made this postulate and had full certaintyregarding it. This was either early in this life or in an earlier life. If the pc has VGIs but no F/N, aDate/Locate (see section below) will do the job.There will be no key-out preceding this, of course. It’s the moment the 1st postulate wasmade, so it isn’t even a release, really. There is nothing earlier. In this case you would only have tofind the key-in points following later (see below). More usually, though, the pc will not manage togo all the way down his track to the time he actually made this 1st postulate; he will give you alater time, and that would be a release with both key-out before and key-in afterwards.Result of step 1: you have rehabilitated a release where the pc knew with great certaintythat he wanted to become a pianist and knew that he was going to make it, too. This may or maynot F/N. No F/N means: key-out or key-in are pressing in on the pc. In either case, do theremaining steps. You want a general erasure, not just a momentary key-out.2. Regarding the release found, find out what keyed out to make it possible. If the pc givesan attitude (postulate) right away - great! Repeater tech on it. If he gives you an E, S or P: lock-scan the item to an F/N. Note down all the postulates. Despite the F/N, do step 3, too."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"893. Auditor: “Tell me all the times when you felt it was impossible to make it as a pianoplayer.” - Lock-scan down to earliest key-in. Again, make sure to take notes of all the postulatesthe pc gives you. Result of step 2 and 3: Absolute basics found and erased.4. Now take up all postulates in order of read size and audit them by repeater technique, thelast step of Postulate Auditing.Result: the pc’s own and foreign-made postulates are as-ised, all incidents, entities andvalences connected with them have been erased. From now on, nothing should interfere any morewith the PC’s following up his purposes and plans. As long as he does what needs doing to takehim there! Because it won’t happen all by itself.Please note that the sequence may be different at times. Quite often in step 1, the pc willstart talking about his key-ins right away. That’s fine, take it up and handle as described in step 3.Then put the other steps in. Always work along the lines of the pc’s interest and you’ll be all right.The bank will “defoliate” all by itself.REHAB BY COUNTING“Rehab by counting” is a shortcut method used to obtain a quick key-out concerning asubject. It is very useful when you just want to handle surface charge and leave a more thoroughhandling till later. It is excellent for handling false reads, for keying out the aberrated, compulsivevariety of “pleasure moments”, induced by drugs, sex and alcohol (see Tech Dict.), and forrehabilitating light and repeated releases. All of this needs a light approach.The procedure:Pc: “I feel so great playing the piano; I really love it!” - LF. (Note that this statement ismade in a light mood. Therefore a light approach is justified.)Auditor: “Give me the first figure that comes to your mind: how often did you feel greatplaying the piano?”Pc: “163 times.” - F. Auditor: “I’d like to indicate to you, you felt great playing the piano163 times. This figure is correct. “ - BD F/N VGIs.It may not always go so easily. Here is a complication you are going to encounter often:Pc: “163 times (F). But that can’t be as I haven’t played more often than maybe 20 timesall in all!” (Rise)Auditor: “That’s all right. You see, in auditing we duplicate and understand what the bankhas to say, no matter if it’s true for your present life or not. The bank is an aberrated machine; itmay give aberrated answers. When these answers are charged they are important, so we take themup. - I’d like to indicate to you that 163 is the right answer. There are 163 pleasure momentsconnected with playing the piano!” - LF. No F/N. Pc smiles but is somewhat uncertain."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"90Auditor: “Please acknowledge the bank around you that 163 is the right answer; do it in aloud voice. “ - Pc does, laughs, LFBD F/N.Note that the auditor acknowledges the pc’s answer in a general way. He does not say:“You had 163 pleasure moments in playing the piano”, but: “There are 163 . . .” etc. This way henot only acknowledges the pc himself but as well all the entities and valences who have respondedto the auditing command and contribute to the total figure of 163 (whereas 20 is correct for the pc).In the light of this, here is a final variation:Pc: “163 times (F). But that can’t be as I haven’t played more often than maybe 20 times(sF) all in all!” (Rise)Auditor gives his little explanation about duplicating and understanding the bank, and thensays: “I would like to indicate that 163 is correct for the bank, and 20 times is correct for you!”BDVGIs F/N.Why this handling? Because in this case the “20 times” read as well as the “163”; so bothneed acknowledging separately.The reference for this approach is given by the auditing comm cycle (Tech Dict.), wherethe pc is seen as separate from the bank and consulting it as if it were a data manual - which in factit is. There is nothing wrong with reminding the pc occasionally that in auditing one is dealing withbank data and not necessarily with his data. This keeps auditing from getting too serious and the pcfrom introverting into the “wisdom’s” the bank has to offer. As well there are the importantreferences of Axiom 29 and Factor 28, whereby you must assign the correct authorship to aparticle, mass or energy so as to make it blow."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"914.5 Dating And Locating (D/L)THEORYDating and Locating (D/L) is a very fast and direct method to produce a key-out. One getsthe exact date and location of the earliest beginning of the incident the pc is recalling. This usuallyis a relative basic. A D/L therefore produces a key-out by snapping the link between absolute basicand pc. The GPM gets disconnected. A D/L works on time and place only; form and event areonly considered as much as they are needed to correctly get time and place.Dating & Locating is useful to blow charge off somatics the pc may have had in the past:“As a child I had pneumonia”. Or: “I sometimes got panicky in elevators”. You have to find thebeginning; that’s all there is to it. Once you have it you can do your D/L. For rehabilitating failedpurposes it is very useful: you D/L the first moment the pc postulated his purpose (1st postulate)with the absolute certainty that this was what he was going to be or do or have, and that he wasgoing to make it. (“On the day after my fourth birthday I just knew I wanted to be a farmer. It wasexactly at 10:27 and 13 seconds. I stood on top of the staircase and still had the doorknob in myhand”. ) Likewise it can be used to blow a stop off (2nd postulate). Just find the earliest momentthe pc can recall of encountering the stop and D/L it. It works nicely. (“When my father said Ishould become a school teacher and not a farmer. I was twelve years old; 1956, 8th of May, at2:23 and 12 seconds; I stood next to the mirror in the lounge, right between him and the door.”)Nothing should keep you from finding the postulate in the incident, too; it’s the postulate, after all,which creates the stop.D/L serves as a shortcut in lockscanning. Instead of going through the lock chain again andagain and again until it’s flat, and then finding the basic and running it again and again and againtill it’s erased, you may do a D/L and get the earliest beginning of the earliest incident right away,resulting in a key-out with VGIs and F/N. -The choice of the tool you are going to use depends onyour thoroughness of approach. Some things you want to treat lightly only - that’s where the D/Lcomes handy. It does depend as well on the pc’s confront level. A pc who can’t look down histimetrack deeply enough will get very shallow key-outs with a Date/Locate.Date/Locating is a very light action. It takes good TRs to do it, particularly a friendly TR-0and TR-2. -This is because the lack of certainty in the pc must be made up for by the certainty ofthe auditor. More than anywhere else, the auditor’s presence is upholding the session here.PROCEDURE(0) In the earlier part of the session or in the interview, you have established somethingwhich you are now going to date and locate. Usually it is the beginning of an incident. Example:pc has had flu or has it now. So you start out by saying: “Tell me about (whatever the condition isyou want to D/L)”."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"92(1) Get the exact beginning of the incident. Ask “Is there an earlier beginning?” (E/B),until you have the exact beginning. You can tell when you have it because you will get a goodread on it and the pc will brighten up.Getting the exact beginning is important because all things start with a postulate. But don’tpush for it as not all pcs are equally able to find the postulate right away. Just take what the pcgives you easily. - When the pc has found the beginning exactly and there is no F/N, the exact datewill get the F/N.(2) “When was that?” (i.e. the exact beginning.) The pc will answer with some form ofdate; it may not always be a calendar type date. (“In 1963” as an example for a calendar type date;“When I was 6” and “Just after the thunderstorm” as other acceptable ways of dating.)(3) “When was it exactly?” Get the pc to narrow it down within the time system he startedout with. Indicate each part of the date he is giving which reads. Encourage him to be as precise ashe possibly can. (In May - sF; the 17th sF; 3:30 pm -T; no. 3:34! - F; 3:34 and 28 seconds!” - LF.)Usually the pc will refuse to believe that one can be this precise. Use good and friendly TR-2 andhe’ll be amazed to see how finely he can get it narrowed down. -At some point there will be a LFor a BD, and an F/N.(4) No F/N on (3): indicate the complete date to the pc in the sequence he gave it. It willF/N now.(5) No F/N after full indication: “On that time, was anything suppressed? - invalidated? -not-ised?” (Each reading button repetitive to flat or F/N.)There will be a correction of the date; or some detail in the incident will come up whichhasn’t been looked at ever. Then the rest of the charge on the date will blow and it will F/N.(6) With or without F/N on the dating step: do the locating step now. The end product ofthe action is to blow the mass completely. You have discharged it sufficiently on the dating stepalready; when there was no F/N on it, the locating step will complete the job.If you had a big BD and wide F/N and VGIs on the dating step you may have blown thecomplete mass already. - Do the locating step anyway, just to be sure. But careful! Don’t O/R!Don’t make him pull back what he has blown already!Command: “With your hand still on the can, take one finger off and point m the directionof the incident where it seems to be now.” Keep the pc from going “rational” or “geographical”.Encourage him to point to the first thing which comes to his mind, to do it intuitively. This willgive you a good read.The pc in most cases points directly to the ridge, not to the real or imagined geographicallocation of the incident. He will point upward or downward, left or right - wherever the ridge issituated. Less often the pc will locate himself in the actual incident, i.e. himself as a thetan. It doeshappen, for example when he went exterior after his own death and felt all confused about hislocation."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"93(7) “What’s the distance to that point? Do the same procedure as in the dating step (3);down to the millimeter if needed. Indicate in full at the end (4); use the three buttons when there isno F/N after the full indication (5) . There will be a final blow after this step, and a final F/N.(8) If there is still no F/N, there must be an earlier similar time (E/S) or an earlier beginning(E/B).You didn’t get the first time or the exact beginning right when you started the action.Don’t lose your TRs over this. Do step (1) again and go through the process in the sameway as before. It will work now.Note: The meter reads as soon as the pc reaches with his attention towards the right item inhis bank. So pointing out reads as he is looking can help him find the hidden answer. This is called“steering” (E-Meter Drill 21). Use the meter for steering purposes only when the pc doesn’t knowfurther or is uncertain. If you do steer, keep it light; just enough to get him going again. - Do notmake the pc depend on the meter, whether in a D/L or any other process. You want to createcertainty of self in the pc, not meter dependence.(References: Meter dependence: Tech Vol.V, p. 334. D/L Procedure: XII-233.

Listing was already explainedearlier on, in the chapter “Introduction to the various Techniques”. One asks a question which isformulated in such a way that it allows only a single item as an answer, the pc gives a list ofpossible answers until he hits upon the answer of all answers. This is “THE item”. The auditor“gives the pc his item”, and if it hasn’t F/N’ed yet, it will F/N now.Should it not work out so nicely, the auditor must use “nulling”. He repeatedly assesses thereading items on the list until they all except one, stop reading. They have become null-items. (Seeas well E-Meter Drill 24.)The last one remaining is considered by elimination -THE item. Nullinghas its risks, for once the pc begins to lose certainty or to lack interest in the subject, your L&N-action will stall! Therefore it is best to find the item already on the listing step when the charge onthe subject is still good and hot.Even without nulling, listing doesn’t always work as smoothly as in the icecream-example.Take a question like: “In your life, who or what would you like to help?” This question is likely tohit the core of the whole case, provided it is well placed. Here, however, the pc will not be readyand prepared to rattle off half a dozen answers and then come up with the item. Oh no! He willthink and figure and sweat and grumble and even claim that he cannot possibly find a properanswer to the question! It may go on like this for an hour. Without excellent TR-4 from the side ofthe auditor the session will come to a dead standstill. And precisely that is the difficulty of L&N: itis too simple an action! The auditor can’t hide behind some tech. He has his question (which ofcourse has to read) and his TRs - nothing else.There is a specialty we ought to deal with here: sometimes it happens that the pc answerswith a plural-item instead of a singular-item, and that it F/N’s. Example: in the interview the pccomplained about the frightening state of the Earth in political and ecological respects. The C/Sdecides to get right down to the bottom of the matter and writes the following question into theprogram: “Who or what would ruin the planet?” (This wording was chosen in accordance with anorigination of the pc done during the interview and accompanied by a BD.) PC: “The humanrace!” BD, F/N, GIs. (Not VGIs.) The auditor does a “represent list” now, in order to reduce theanswer to a singular item: “Who or what would represent ‘the human race’ to you?” PC (awoman): “All men!” Again with BD, F/N, GIs. Auditor: “Who or what would represent ‘all men’to you?” Pc searches around a bit and then, to the surprise of both, comes up with the answer:“Joseph Stalin!” and starts to laugh uncontrollably and compulsively. Big BD, big F/N, VGIs.Later it turns out that she, in her life just before this one, was a victim of Stalin’s agriculturalreforms and died in this context. The original L&N question obviously beamed down to a deepand heavy layer of charge which was hidden under present-day restimulators (global ecologicalproblems) and could only be unearthed through two additional questions.Listing and Nulling is a very direct way to get at valences, no matter if these are caused bythe pc’s own incidents or by entities. It is useful with all sorts of AESPs, but works only when thepc is “ripe” for the question. When the question hits upon too many associated items of equalstrength, the pc will not manage to put weight and importance on the right one, and a list withequally large reads on all items will result. You could do your nulling now, but this bears its risks"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"95as pointed out above. To avoid these and not give a wrong item to the pc, it is advisable toprepcheck the item remaining after the nulling is done. Or you drop the whole action and follow upthe AESP item in question by lock-scanning in order to find the underlying engram. Works slower,yes, but is a safe route.But let us assume the pc were properly set up for this action. It would look like this then:0. The pc said in the interview that he could not learn properly.1. Auditor: “Who or what wouldn’t be able to learn properly?” (The questions are alwaysasked in a potential not an actual form in order to keep the scope of possible answers wide.)2. PC gives his list and finally comes up with “A dumb lout!” as the item, with BD,F/N,VGIs. (This could either mean that the pc was once screamed at, abused with these words andprobably beaten, because he didn’t do his homework right so that his inclination to learn sankdown to nil. He then went into the valence impressed on him. Or the whole thing did not happen tohim personally but to an entity which connected up with him when he came home from school oneday with bad marks and when father boxed his ears lightly and called him a dumb lout enough torestimulate the entity and drive the pc into its valence.)3. The item is now prepchecked in order to get at all incidents connected with it and tothoroughly discharge it. You could just as well run six ruds on it.Here as well there is a specialty worth mentioning: the pc may give “I!” as an answer. Hehas not identified the item but is identified with it. In this case one would desist from taking anyfurther action! If one did, one would risk opening up all of the case because of the possibility ofwrong authorship - and turn all hell loose on the pc.The only danger connected with L&N is that, without enough care, the auditor couldindicate a “wrong item”. It may be entirely wrong or perhaps just a little bit wrong. This canhappen when the auditor did not write the precise formulation of the item down, and thereforedoesn’t give the accurate item to the pc when it comes to it. Small mistakes can go a long wayhere! L&N can give access to deep layers of the bank, as we have seen, and if incorrectlyidentified, the pc can become seriously upset and introverted. He has taken the wrong reason forsome recognized case difficulty. He uses a wrong why as a stable datum to re-arrange his life .And he won’t have a chance, of course! Not only was no charge blown, but additional areas ofbank are restimulated, too, as he tries to make sense of it. The more the pc thinks about his wrongitem, the more he will be heating the restimulation up and the more confused and unhappy he willfeel. You have to keep a watchful eye on these phenomena. Should they occur, the pc mustimmediately be interviewed concerning his last few sessions in order to find out if a wrong item inthe broadest sense of the word was given. Perhaps it did not even happen in session but came fromsome authoritative person whose opinions the pc is used to blindly follow! To shed light into this isnot always easy, because the pc after all agreed to the wrong item.

The significance of a high TA and the specific phenomenon of afloating needle were not known from the first day E-meters were used. Neither were these thingsgenerally observed and accepted by all auditors. This lead to loads of people being run beyondtheir EPs in the old days and “rehabilitation tech” was even made a matter of policy in 1966 (Vol.VI, p.143). That the subject of F/N and TA position was undefined territory in the early days canbe concluded from the fact that the F/N is not mentioned earlier than 1965 in the Tech Volumes(VI, p. 66) and that the E-meter drills only date from 1961 onward - fully nine years after the meterwas introduced.The question of “high” versus “normal” TA therefore is a matter of a) the agreement on acertain measuring scale and b) the observations made regarding it. On the scale being used, the“normal” TA range between 2.0 and 3.0 is marked by the two “clear reads” - 2.0 for female, 3.0for male bodies. This refers to the body resistance with no added charge created by the thetan.However, these two points of 2.0 and 3.0 respectively are evidently not correct for all female ormale bodies. The variation from body to body may be as much as 0.5 TA divisions. This meansthat the clear read for males may be anywhere between 2.5 and 3.5, for females between 1.5 and2.5! Therefore the high TA starts at 3.5. Unfortunately the measuring deviation from one E-meterto the next has to be taken into account as well. It is around 0.3 TA divisions. So an objective TAof 3.5 may be at 3.2 on one meter and on 3.8 on the next. One has to keep this tolerance range inmind. It follows that a TA of 3.8 is definitely outside this tolerance band, therefore out of normalrange and for this reason called a high TA. (For male bodies, mind you.) For reasons of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"98convenience and probably because “Ron says so”, the question has been settled with theconsideration that the TA starts being high at 3 .5. (Which is - quite illogically so considered validfor women as well.)THE RISING TAAs we saw before: the thetan builds up protest charge whenever he doesn’t get what hewants, or when he can’t get away from something he does not want. This charge is made now, inthe session . The energy created by the pc forms a resistance which adds to the body resistance.The needle rises. More power is needed to overcome this increased resistance. In order to keep theneedle on “set”, the auditor turns up the TA to make more current flow. So the TA “rises”.The dianetics auditors will say now: “Sure, that’s because an engram is in restimulation!”And they are right. Dianetically speaking, the charge contained in the engram, originally created inthe past, has been restimulated and is re-created in the present.Those trained in scientology techniques would say: “Rising TA means either protest oroverrun! “ And they would be right as well. It may be a new protest or O/R of the present, or therestimulation of a GPM of the past. It has been dormant in the meantime and becomes active now,since the flip-flop between 1st and 2nd postulate is set in motion. (What’s the difference between aprotest and an overrun? In an overrun something good happened and then things went badly,which is what the thetan didn’t like. In a protest he didn’t like what happened from the start.)Both parties agree (the dianetics and the scientology ones) that the TA will rise when anearlier similar incident, no matter of what kind, is pressing in. You are busy planing down anincident narrative style, and the TA rises. Why? An E/S has been unearthed. Since the incident youare currently dealing with has been sufficiently unburdened, the earlier one in line can now floatto the surface.The common denominator between all these viewpoints is precisely what was said at thestart of this section: the TA rises because the thetan is protesting against something - against thecharge of an engram pushing in on him; against something having gone wrong in his life (protest);against something desirable having gone away and something undesirable having taken its place(O/R). All charge therefore is protest charge. The handling is different, though, depending onwhether one is working in the style of dianetics or that of scientology.A note to the budding young auditor: don’t worry when the TA rises. It’s part of theprocess! When you start a process on a charged item, you will see a building up of charge and arising TA and a working off of charge and a falling TA. The TA is “pumping” . This to beexpected and it is a good indicator! It means the pc is doing work. You only have to startworrying when the pc isn’t in-session anymore: disinterested suddenly, finds no more to look at,wonders about the whole thing, etc. - and the TA going up and up! So here is a rule: Pc well in-session, with TA pumping = good indicator; carry on with the process. Pc not in-session, with TAgoing high and sticking = bad indicator find out what’s going on."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"99THE LOW TAShould the pc give up fighting his masses there is only one alternative: he has to identifywith them. He goes out of valence. (DMSMH: either you dramatize the engram and you go out ofvalence or you suppress the dramatization and you get somatics.)As thetan, body, and masses have become one field now, the current can flow very easily.There is very little resistance, even less than what the body offers normally. So there is very littlepower needed and the TA stays below 2.0. -This is a low TA. (Wet hands make a false low TA!)HOW TO GET THE TA DOWNWe have seen that there is basically only one type of charge, and that is protest charge. Thehandling, however, is varied. It depends on the type of auditing one is doing, speaking in the“classical” categories, it is either dianetics (running engrams to erasure) or scientology (producingkey-outs).Engram in restimulation: On a dianetic rundown, when you see a high TA you knowimmediately: engram in restimulation. When this happens at session start, you must find out withthe pc which engram may have gone in restimulation. When it happens during the session, you goeither E/S, or look over the folder and find where it went wrong. You could as well put your hopeon a repair list called “L3RG” to find and correct the mistake.In postulate auditing you’d have to go over your worksheets to see if you didn’t finish acycle of action properly or if there is more than one incident or entity in restimulation at the sametime. (Do ask the pc. It will read when it is the case. Mostly it is the case.)Protest or Overrun: In scientology auditing, the first thing you think of on seeing the TArise is: protest or O/R, just as it says in C/S-Series 1. - You check these questions on the meter andhandle accordingly: the O/R by Rehab procedure, the protest by itsa and E/S-itsa.When the pc comes in with a high TA after having had a normal in-range TA in hisprevious sessions, you ask him if anything has happened since the last session. He will come upwith a protest or an O/R, either caused by life or by his past auditing. When you don’t get a readthe easy way - on the questions: “Something happened?”, “Protest?”, “Overrun?” - you hadbetter rephrase your questions and ask the same thing in many different ways: Did anythinghappen the pc absolutely disagreed with? Did someone work against him? Was he fed up withsomething or someone? Did something good happen to him and nobody noticed it? Did he have awin or release or cognition in context with the process he ran?When the TA is high and sticky you must ask the exact question in order to get the needlemoving. This may take some doing. (Do write down exactly what you are asking!) When you hitthe right area you will see a tick, and you steer the pc by it, and it turns into a sF, and now it dawnson him, and you get a F, and finally he can tell you what it is. Depending on the type of answeryou handle it either by protest- or by rehab-procedure."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"100Exterior: If protest or O/R doesn’t handle, what do you do? Check for a very special typeof release which the pc usually would not think of himself, and that’s: exterior. ‘ In your recentauditing (or: in life), did you go exterior?” (Make sure the new pc understands the question.) Thiswill give a good read if it is the case you handle it by rehab procedure to F/N. The TA will be innormal range. Take a break till the next day. All fine the next day: carry on with your program.However, when the rehab of exterior doesn’t get the TA down into normal range, or when you gotit down at the end of the session but the pc comes in the next day and his TA is up again: Now youmust do an Int Rundown, there’s no way around it. (“Interiorization-Exteriorization RD”, seeTech Dict and the pertinent references in Vol .XII. )Why does the TA go up after the pc went exterior? The explanation given in HCOB 4 Jan71R, “Exteriorization and High TA”, is: engram in restimulation. Before he went in he was out(which is the natural state for a thetan) and having been forced in by violent means is an engram.(See “Implant” in the Tech Dict.) Going exterior, then, may restimulate the earlier beginning of theincident, and that was going interior. The ensuing high TA can be interpreted, dianetically, asengram charge. Likewise it may be looked at, scientologically, as overrun/protest charge and behandled that way.Overruns and Protests in Life: Should the TA be high from the first moment the pc takesthe cans in the interview, and if there would be no good-sized reads in the interview which wouldgive you a lead into the charged areas, you would assume that the pc sits on some big (and oftenmultiple) protest or O/R of long duration which has been overshadowing his life for years. (Thepossibility of the pc being in actual pain must be checked into as well!) So you ask for protest andO/R with the prefix “In your life, has anything been . . .?” It may be as simple as that; it maydemand a more specific wording, the exact question. Make a list of possible questions to do withprotest and O/R. (See the examples in the paragraph above) . Do an Assessment by TA (E-MeterDrill 23), take up the best reading area; handle by protest or O/R procedure.Note that the pc may come up with more than one area. Start with the biggest reading oneand rehab that. You may get stuck and not be able to take it to F/N - yet the TA has come down alittle. Take up the next one, rehab. You may get stuck again, yet the TA is down a bit more. Youare working in the right direction. Take up the third one. This may come to an F/N - a small one,on a high TA, but still an F/N. Now go back to the first area, take that to F/N. (Always andunvaryingly use the rehab procedure.) Now that this is handled, finish cycle on the second area. Bynow the TA will be in range and the pc happy and quite changed; his F/N will be wide now. Takeup the remaining areas the pc has mentioned - but watch out: he may not even be interested anymore !Overrun and Protest because of past bad sessions: Auditing itself may drive the pc’sTA up. - He may not even have had any auditing before, yet as soon as he sees an E-Meter or getsquestioned by the auditor, he keys in on past police interrogations, medical screenings, psychiatricshock treatments, on black magic sessions or even on bad past-life auditing - things he protestedagainst or became thoroughly fed up with.If this wasn’t picked up on the step above (“O/R and protest in life”), you ask the pcstraightforwardly: does auditing remind you of anything? Have you experienced something similarto it previously? Do you feel uncomfortable about the meter? The cans? The session space?"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"101Processes? Auditors? Questions? Psychiatry? Inquisition? Police? Doctors? Rituals? Ceremonies?Weird practices? Implants? Been in scientology in your past life? Had past life auditing?Something or other will read. Handle with protest or O/R. Quite likely the charge will havebeen sitting there for quite a long time already, probably since lifetimes down the track. So makesure to get the earliest beginning of the protest, or the first release point. Use lockscanningtechnique to clean the track so the pc can go earlier and earlier to the real beginning of it all.Chronically high and stuck TA: Some pc’s aren’t impressed by one or more engrams orGPMs in restimulation. They manage to tell you their whole life story with their needle stuck andtheir TA at 4.8. Some even say they feel fine and crack a joke -TA glued to the 5.3 mark. They areso used to fighting the bank that it has become habitual to them, so much so that they don’t evennotice . This is a “habitual not-is” . To crack those old jammed-up circuits there’s only oneremedy: objective processes!HANDLING THE LOW TABefore you do any low TA handlings: make sure the TA isn’t low because of the pc’s wethands! A real low TA results from overwhelm. It means unflat OTIII, as Hubbard says on theCl.VIII course. (See Robertson’s “Cl.VIII Notes”.) So how does one handle a low TA on a pcwho isn’t on OTIII yet? -To put it differently: how can you handle the composite case without theuse of the OTIII materials?Let us first look at the underlying cause for low TA: it means identification with a winningvalence (Tech Dict.) brought about by the use of force; it means overwhelm. The being has beenutterly invalidated, suppressed, unmocked, made nothing of. This may have happened either to thepc himself or to an entity in his composite case which is in restimulation (without the pc knowingit, of course). No matter what: we are dealing with invalidation.How to handle? For example by “Evaluation of long duration?” and “Invalidation of longduration?”, run alternately to F/N, first one then the other, again and again, till they each F/N oncalling the command. Or by six false ruds, done repetitively (1-6, 1-6, 1-6) till they F/N on callingthe command: “Did anyone say you had an (out-rud) when you didn’t have one?” This approachof course aims directly at the eval/inval the pc has inflowed from others (people or - unknowingly -his entities, circuits and valences), and gets it out of the way. - It may be followed up by six reverseruds, repetitive to F/N: “Does anyone have a (rud) with you? “This again addresses the out-rudsthe pc is inflowing from the composite case. (See the chapter on rudiments . )Doing these little rundowns will clean up the pc’s social field, reestablish his certainty ofself and put him back in valence, build up his confront and keep the composite off his back. (Agood TR’s-Course would help a lot, too!) His TA will come up into range as a result."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"102PART FOUR:ProfessionalApplication."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"103The Bridge Below ClearTHE LIFE REPAIRWith the techniques covered so far, and provided you have done your drills and TRs well,you are in the position to start auditing someone on a full Life Repair and perhaps even take himup to Clear.An interview is always the best thing to begin a case handling with, but it demands someauditing experience and the ability to write very fast, to see and note down all reads, and tointerpret them later. How to do an interview is described in a later chapter. For the moment, we aretaking the viewpoint that the beginning auditor cannot do one, and ways are pointed out how hecan still audit despite that.The first action one would do on a new pc, is called “Life Repair”, as we saw in thedescription of the bridge in Volume 1. In the superficial understanding of the word, this means:handling what the pc’s attention is on at present; “getting the pc’s rudiments in” on his life. In adeeper understanding it would mean getting at the roots of what is fouling up the pc’s life, workingdirectly at the core of his case, rehabilitating his causativeness and self-determinism. The greatestruin of a thetan is the fact that he has a case . Therefore it must be the goal of all auditing actions, tomake the pc go Clear or at least lead him one step further in that direction.No matter with how much depth you are personally able to program and audit a LifeRepair, as you start a case off you will always encounter four basic situations, leading to differentassumptions about the auditability of the PC:1. One would assume that the pc cannot be audited well on recall processes because he hastaken drugs, medicines and alcohol excessively in the past or is doing so at present. Or because onefinds out after a few sessions that his confront is so weak that he sees more in the bank than he caneasily face up to and therefore runs away from it.2. Lacking a drug history, one would assume that the pc can be audited well on recallprocesses. Specific situation: his attention is mainly on body problems, i.e. psychosomatic illnesses(“somatics”).3. The same assumption as in 2, for the same reason. Specific situation: the pc has no bodyproblems and only wishes to increase his abilities in certain areas of his life.4. All of that together, at the same time.The handling:Re 1: Have the pc do TRs and objectives. That handles the low confront part. Then, if hehas a drug problem as well, audit a “Drug Rundown” as the first subjective auditing action. (Seesection below)."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"104Re 2: Use Dianetics or Postulate Auditing. You could of course try to key his somatics outwith a Date/Locate . This works in many cases. However, should this light approach fail, youwould have to do a full “Dianetic Assist” to handle his current pains. Do send the pc to the doctorfirst to make sure that all possibilities of standard medical help have been exhausted and that hisillnesses are indeed psychosomatic. This keeps you out of legal trouble. (See as well Auditor’sCode point 25.)- When there are no physical sensations or pains and the pc’s main interest is on his mentaland spiritual development, you would start him scientology style with Ruds, Rehabs , Prepchecks .This will blow lots of locks, increase his confront ability on life and make him a real release. Thisapproach is faster and lighter than the dianetics one, where you would list all unwanted AESPs ofthe pc’s life and audit the corresponding engram chains. Yet it is far less thorough, because it doesnot lead to the source of the stops. Which road you prefer to take depends on your evaluation ofcircumstances and priorities (Ax. 58). You could combine both approaches by using PostulateAuditing.Re 4: Do the handling of point 1 to start with as that would form the prerequisite foreverything else. Then you would have to do a thorough interview in order to establish the quantityof charge for each area of interest, and work out a program in the corresponding sequence. Thatwould be the optimum route. Less optimum, a bit slower and less effective, would be to just givethe pc question 1 of Postulate Auditing (“Tell me what’s bothering you”), and take it from there.Here you would totally rely on the bank opening up all by itself, by following the direction the pc’sattention takes. Those experienced in Dianetics would make a list of AESPs and handle engramsby R3RA-technique, hoping in the same way for the bank to open.THE DRUG RUNDOWNDrugs, medicine or alcohol taken excessively in the past or present have extremelyundesirable mental and psychosomatic effects on the pc. A drug handling must be done as part ofthe Life Repair. Depending on the amount of charge on this subject, it is put in its appropriate placein the sequence of things to be handled.The whole theory of the Drug Rundown is hinged on the term chemical release. One takesdrugs in order to have a good time, to dull the comm-lines into the body so that no more pain isfelt, or to get unusual mental or physical powers for a short time. It’s an artificial way of goingrelease temporarily, and may even amount to states comparable to OT (“Keyed-out OT” [2]).Yet, artificial or not, it’s a release in case it worked. (It doesn’t always work.)That’s whythe first step on the classical drug rundown is a rehab of releases on the drugs taken. A list of drugsmedicines and alcohol taken in the past is made. (The word “drugs” is to be taken in its widestsense, it includes anything causing physical or spiritual effects such as inhaling glue or poisonousgases.) Each reading one is rehabilitated in the style of Rehab by Counting, in sequence of readsize, as usual.The second step is a recall step. The pc recalls the times he took drugs, repetitive style, onfour flows. This would complete the scientology-style drug rundown."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"105The dianetics version extends from this. One would now find out about the AESPsconnected with the drugs taken and run the respective engram chains on four flows. Then onewould find out what AESPs were the original reason to take each of those drugs, and handle therespective chains by dianetic technique (R3RA).You can do a Drug Rundown in the style of Postulate Auditing too. Take a reading drugon the list and lock-scan all the times the pc took it till you get down to absolute basic - which iswhen the pc decided he needed a little help because he couldn’t bear it any longer. Or it was a drugimplant. During the lock-scan, do make a note of all reading AESPs. When you have finished thelock-scanning part and erased all the basics you found, you would then take up the AESPsincurred so far and audit them with the steps 1-20 of Postulate Auditing. (Are habilitation of pastreleases through drugs, medicines and alcohol is not done separately as it is well taken care ofduring the lock-scanning part.)The EP’s are worded according to the four flows. Flow 1: “No harmful effects left fromdrugs/medicine/alcohol taken in the past; no further need to take them.” F-2: “No compulsion togive drugs to others to make them happy or suffer less.” F-3: “No compulsion to take drugsoneself when one sees others take them.”F-0: “No need to give drugs to oneself to make oneselffeel better.” (The difference between F-1 and F-0 lies in the determinism. In F-1 one was asked totake them; in F-0 one decided to do so oneself.)Should your pc be a heavy druggy (now or in his past) he may need a special set-upprogram consisting of vitamins, adequate nutrition and exercises. As well he should be given theopportunity to do useful physical work, getting properly rewarded for it. This program starts to re-establish an ethical basis for his life with self-determined control of body and environment. Heought to do plenty of objective processes and TRs, to be auditable on recall processes later on. Thisis because drugs block his recall ability and make needle and TA go sticky.Of course it is permissible to take medicines in an emergency, particularly organic orhomeopathic ones, to then stop taking them when the emergency is over. Therefore one cannot saythat anybody who took the occasional medicines, has a “drug case”. Even then, when the pc neverwas hung up on drugs, you still had better check the Drug Rundown EPs, just to be sure, and toconfirm it for him.(Ref: HCOB 21 Dec 1980, “The Scientology Drug Rundown”. HCOB 17 Oct 69,“Drugs, Aspirin and Tranquilizers”. All entries in the index of Vol.X, XI, XII under the headingof “drugs” and “drug rundown” . A useful compilation of relevant materials is given in theVolunteer Minister’s Handbook.)A NOTE ON THE GRADES(This section is mainly addressed to those readers who have some experience with Gradesauditing.)Grades are - as the term implies - a gradual approach to removing charge from the case.They are arranged in a logical order, starting with the subject of communication (Grade 0) and"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"106continuing with the subjects of problems (Grade I), overts/withholds (Grade II), life ruins (GradeIII) and Service Facsimiles (Grade IV) . Their arrangement and their aim very much resemble therudiments. Considering that each Grade has a few dozen processes, they are really a broad way ofputting the ruds in on life.Historical background: They are first mentioned in 1965 (C/S Series 2). Back then therewas only a small number of key processes. They were co-audited since there wasn’t any paid-forauditing for the public yet. Between 1965 and 1970 the tech went badly out; the infamous“Quickie Grades” were delivered: all processes were done in a couple of hours by riding along onthe F/N of the first process, thereby F/Ning all further processes in its wake. The remedy to thiswere the “Expanded Lower Grades”, a collection of processes put together by editorial teams whowent through Hubbard’s original writings of the 1950s, looked through all processes they foundscattered about in his various writings, and grouped them in accordance with one Grade or theother (C/S-Series 12). The BTB of 4 Jan 1972 finalized this project. (“BTB” means “BoardTechnical Bulletin”, a bulletin not written by Hubbard himself but by another.)Note that by this time, the delivery of paid-for auditing to the public had started. It formedan important income source to the expanding CofS. Therefore many new auditors had to be trainedas quickly as possible. In this context one may suspect that the Grades, being very simple to audit,were meant to replace the self-determined thinking, the solution-oriented creativity of the auditorand the C/S. (Not the original key processes, but the compilation known as “Grades 0-IV”.) Lookat the early 70’s: Hubbard tried in many ways to dilute the Class VIII knowledge of 1968 down tothe level of beginners, due to the shortage of Class VIII C/Ses at a time of worldwide expansion.So instead of having to work out their own solutions, beginners were given prefabricated solutions:fixed rundowns and repair lists for any possible situation. This didn’t do much good to theirthinking ability.The very nature of the Expanded Grades supports this suspicion. They are a catch-allmethod for any kind of case. If you’d start a pc on “ARC-Straightwire” (the lowest Gradesprocess) and ran him through all charged processes there are up to Gr.IV, there’s nothing in thecase which could possibly escape you. Provided there aren’t any unexpected case difficulties, suchas a drug history, this approach could be done on anyone without any C/Sing. (See “ResistiveCase Points” in the Tech Dict.) No thinking needed. Just run the next process. Boring on the pc,yes; pc not always in-session, yes; takes an awful long time and costs a fortune, yes; but in the endwe are getting there, no doubt. It’s like shooting at your pet canary inside his cage with a shotgun:you don’t have to aim all that carefully as at least one piece of shot is bound to hit him.The editorial team which put the Grades processes together certainly did a fantastic job.Without their efforts a huge amount of processes might have passed into oblivion. Yet they madetwo mistakes which the auditor ought to be aware of:First mistake: they tried to turn process commands into four flows which should have beenleft standing the way they were. (Those were the times of “Triple Flows”, followed later by“Quadruple Flows”, so apparently everything had to be turned into four flows - by decree from“high up” -, whether it was logically fitting or not . )Second mistake: in quite a few cases the flows are misworded in such a way that F-1 andF-2 are mixed up, that F-2 and F-3 only differ in that they are formulated as singular and plural,"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"107that F-0 looks the same as F-1 or is worded in some illogical fashion having nothing to do with theactual intention of the process. Both auditor and pc usually get into trouble when they try to workout what it all means.So always, before running a Grades process with funny-looking flows which don’t makesense to you, check up on the original process by Hubbard. The source is usually quoted in theGrades process materials. Then decide if you are going to drop the flows on this particular processbecause it should be left as it was formulated originally, or if the wording of the flows has to becorrected.Taking heed of the above, the C/S usually will have little trouble with the Grades. With thepc well set up, they usually run all by themselves . The only trouble one may get into is doing toomuch of them and overruning the EP.The significance of the Grades nowadays, their value to the C/S, is a matter of discussion.Earlier on, in the seventies, one did dianetics actions as the first thing in order to handle the pc’sphysical problems, to set all his attention free and allow him to fully concentrate on Clear. Thispurpose was served by the Grades, which back then went up to VII. The EP of Grade VII was theClear. 1976 and 1978 - with Dianetic Clear - significant changes occurred in the tech; the oldGrade VII was no longer needed. (See Volume 1.) Which technical criteria (or power politics)played a role there, is hard to guess. In the end (and up till today) it all came down to the pcreceiving first “introductory processes”, then the Grades, then Dianetics. Most incomprehensibly,the Life Repair, earlier an integral part of the bridge below anything else, was omitted. The beautyof a Life Repair is that it is directly tailored to the pc’s needs. This one cannot say of the Gradesthey are much rather a broadside from all guns. Even the old Standard Dianetics, done by means ofAESPs voiced by the pc, was very much following his personal needs, which is certainly not sowith New Era Dianetics (NED) and its hyper-technical approach to the case.As a result from the re-building of the bridge and the omission of the Life Repair, the techhad lost its “human dimensions” and became unpleasantly technocratic. The reason for this maybe what was already said further up: anyone can audit Grades, you don’t even need a C/S for it.But doing a good interview and working out a tailor-made program - that takes experience andprofessionality. And not everybody has that. And as, in the CofS, degraded auditing has become amass happening, it of course takes masses of auditors, who by necessity are greenhorns led on bygreenhorns. And their tech is no better than that.To go back to the question posed above: today, the Grades do not lead up to Clear anymore, they are but a substitute for the Life Repair. Therefore they become less necessary the morecare is taken in planning and executing the Life Repair. And, as a Life Repair program does notexclude dianetic auditing, it may happen that the pc works on his engrams so thoroughly that hegoes Clear as a result. Try running the Grades processes after a good Life Repair was done, andyou’ll see: yawning boredom. The same is true for Clears who didn’t have the Grades before: theyalso find them boring. Moreover they usually get a lot of false reads because they start running theentities of the composite case.As usual, there is no single rule to suit all cases. The pc may have completed his LifeRepair and you know there is still more that could get done on the case. But the pc doesn’toriginate by himself. This means that he has arrived at a state of agreement with his life where he"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"108doesn’t see any more inconsistencies; therefore there are no origination’s and no reads . You couldleave it at that, tell him to come back when he feels like he needs more auditing, let him go off, anddo another interview and an expanded Life Repair when he returns. Or you could use the Gradesprocesses on him, but selectively: only what he needs. Choose the process which in yourestimation suits the pc best. And some of these Grades processes are marvelous; they can be realcase crackers! Again, the only rule is that of standard tech: do just what the pc needs and wants,no more and no less.Although not all pc’s may need the Grades as an auditing action, it must be clearlyemphasized that the bulletins they are based on, are indispensable for the training of the auditor andthe C/S. Anyone wishing to work professionally must study them.POSTULATE AUDITING: WHY NO FLOWS?Since flows are so common in Dianetics and in Grades auditing, the expert may havewondered how come there are no flows in Postulate Auditing. Well, you may have observed thatin the auditing style of Book One there aren’t any flows at all, and that it still works very well.Flows were only introduced into auditing in context with the OT III research of the mid-60s. Why?Because Flow 3 runs out entities and disconnects the pc from his OTIII case. Which makes iteasier to audit him on his own engrams later on.Further, on closer inspection of Postulate Auditing, you will find that flows are in factimplicitly run on each item you handle The lock-scanning part starts it off with a motivator chain .Then you get to the basic, the real big motivator. Up to here it’s all Flow 1. Then you find thepostulate in the basic incident, that’s Flow 2, because the pc did it himself and it is an overt. Hemay even find out how he was responsible for getting into this situation in the first place, which isFlow 2 again. Then, as you get to the repeater part, the pc starts pulling in entities by repeating thepostulate, and to tell you about situations when he saw others using that particular postulate. Bothof that is Flow 3 Everytime he cognites what he has done to himself by making succumb-postulates, he has a realization concerning Flow 0. So there are flows in Postulate Auditing, afterall."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"109A Simple Life Repair ProgramHOW THE C/S THINKSEach and every pc is most interested in solving the mystery of his existence, where hecomes from, why he is here at all, where fate will take him. All these are significance’s, i.e. thoughtstructures full of ponderous importance. The C/S, in contrast, is not interested in the significance’sbut in the masses of the pc. He knows that there are incidents of unimaginable force and brutalityon the time track, which have to be found and erased so that the pc may find answers to hisquestions about the where from and whereto, and gradually recapture his abilities as a thetan. Heknows that it is only due to these energy masses that the pc keeps figuring why he is in the state hehappens to be in. Without masses, without charge, the pc wouldn’t have any questions. Hewouldn’t be introverted into significance’s, but find games in accordance with his goals andpurposes and take on the challenge of real barriers and real enemies. He would be extroverted.The C/S therefore has the obligation to help the pc find an access to these incidents. Hisattention is mostly on the TA-Action per session hour. This to him is the clear and irrefutableevidence that something is happening in the universe of the pc, that things get shaken about,broken loose, and cleaned up. The more, the better. TAA occurs only when incidents are beingrun. It does not occur when the pc philosophizes fancifully about life whilst holding the cans.Time, place, form, event and the exact postulate - only that counts to the C/S.His constant question is: How do I get the pc to find and run an incident relevant to him?There are various possibilities, depending on the situation you are starting out with. Let’s look atthem one by one:Firstly: The pc tells an incident right from the start without any prompting. That is thesimplest case. Her cat was run over yesterday; she is all in tears about it. Wonderful! Fancy anincident falling into your lap just like that! Let her tell you about it. Narrative style and runningchains are the tools to use here.Secondly: The pc is generally upset and annoyed because of a terminal, i.e. a person, place,animal, plant, or object. Or he is unhappy because things don’t work out right in some area of hislife, be it concerning his girl friend, his job, his football club, whatever. He does not specify veryprecisely what’s going on. Something is foul, certainly, but what exactly? Here you would start outwith a 2WC in a loose and easy manner, and give the pc the opportunity to blow off some steamand sort things out a little. As a result one would have found out who the terminal or what the areain question is. All right. Now how do you get down to the incident from here? With dianetics, youwould ask the pc for the AESPs connected with this terminal or area. Once he has given you anAESP-item you can immediately ask him to relate it to his time track: “Recall a time, when . . .”And there comes the incident! With scientology auditing, you could keep up the 2WC and take itto a key-out and an F/N. You could use an L1C, six ruds or a prepcheck concerning the terminalor area in question. All of these methods will lead to incidents."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"110How deep one manages to reach into the bank depends on the skill of the auditor andcannot immediately be influenced by the C/S. It is quite possible as we have seen, to bridge overby means of Postulate Auditing, from the light scientology processes to the engram/GPM-bank.How good an auditor is at that, solely depends on his experience.And that, simply, is the whole of the wisdom of the C/S and the whole of the task of theauditor. The rest is up to the pc. Communication with the incident, reality on the incident, affinitywith the incident, cognition, erasure. The more he sweats and pants in the process, the more it’sworth it.THE PROGRAMThe following program addresses those auditors who are more at home with scientologythan with dianetics methods. For starting a case it is most suitable for the third of the four situationsalready referred to above, which one may encounter in starting a new pc: no drug history, nosomatics, only an interest in getting a better grip on life in general. The case is entered on the levelof locks, but this can be modified as one goes along, in the direction of engrams, GPMs andentities, depending on one’s skill.This program is useful when the pc does not originate further areas of difficulty by himself,for example after a laborious auditing period with respect to the first two of the four startingsituations. He has gone through all the points originally troubling him. The approach below helpshim to look for new areas of charge.As well there is the advantage that one can do it without a prior interview. Therefore it isuseful to the beginning auditor who can neither do a proper interview, nor analyze its data. Shouldyou, as a green auditor, suffer from nervousness or stagefright: don’t worry. You can’t do anydamage at all with the techniques presented here.1) TA high when you start: “Are you protesting anything?” “Is something going on toolong?” - “Has an achievement not been acknowledged?” - “Is there an O/R?” - Do you havepains?” - “Body problems?” - Is there something you cannot tell anyone?” “Something thatwould kill you if it were told?” (Ask in different ways as needed to suit the pc’s gradient ofunderstanding. Handle all items the pc mentions, to F/N. You may have high TA F/N’s to startwith but eventually the TA will be in range. See the chapter on High/Low TA.)2) TA in range: fly six ruds . (Assess the ARCX slowly by TA, to start with.)3) Ask the pc for times of trouble in his life. Note the reads on each area of charge . Takethe biggest reading one, ask the pc to give you in his own words a prefix for the L1C questionsyou are going to ask him. (“In kindergarten...”, “Before the exams . . .”, “On my job . . .”.) Makesure the prefix reads well. (Never run an unreading prefix!) - Now do an L1C to EP, using thisprefix. Then pick up the remaining areas, in sequence of magnitude of charge. (Result of 2 and 3:Ruds are in on life in general. Now the pc is not distracted by anything and can concentrate on pastwins and releases.)"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"1114) Ask the pc for achievements in his life which were not acknowledged, and for timeswhen he carried on with an activity after having had a win on it, and then felt worse. Note allreads; then rehab all areas, starting with the biggest reading one. (Result of 4: Pc’s certainty andappreciation of self has increased enormously. He is now ready to confront the “big bad boys” inhis life.)5) Ask the pc for terminals he had trouble with in his life. (Terminal = a person, animal,place, or thing.) - Do a prepcheck on each one, starting with the biggest reading one. (Result of 1-5: Pc has cleaned the charge off great parts of his track; he is now prepared to take a long viewover this lifetime and handle charge of long duration.)6) Fly six ruds of long duration. Run them repetitively till they F/N on call. (This will digup things way beyond what the pc was aware of when he started. )Comments: You may do step 6 in the place of step 2 . You’ll find that “normal” rudsdone as step 2 invariably draw you into an LD type handling, simply because the pc’s “wholelife” is sitting on him. Quite often you will find that the new pc is bubbling over with chargeditems - so much so that the ruds approach will appear “too structured” to him. In this case the L1Cor - even more uncomplicated - the prepcheck are better tools than the ruds. (It does depend on theauditor’s skills too.) When you are skilled with Postulate Auditing you may branch off from Ruds,Rehabs and Prepchecks and follow up postulates.The InterviewAfter this simple program has been done, you should have an experienced person do aninterview to search for areas which were so far missed out on, get him to work out a program foryou, and clean those areas up as well.Speaking from a strictly professional viewpoint, an interview should always be the firstthing in line, followed by a thorough case analysis. No “catch-all” approach can match a tailor-made program. Of course, you can always help someone out by using whatever bits of tech youhappen to know; and you should do it. That’s what the tech is there for, after all . But auditingprofessionally, that’s different.AUDITING vs. INTERVIEWINGThere is a difference between an interview and auditing. When this difference is notunderstood there will be meager results in the interview and the C/S won’t have enough data towork from. This is the difference: auditing has the purpose of establishing a comm-line between pcand bank, and of as-ising the bank. In contrast to that, in an interview one doesn’t audit. One findsout what is there that can be audited later.The interviewer gets data with charge on them. The auditor helps the pc to blow thecharge. The interviewer does not do that. He just finds data. The program the C/S makes is based"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"112on data, and only on data. Without any data there can be no auditing program . These data arefound by the interviewer in the interview. There are other sources of data, too, such as reports onthe pc by friends and family, etc., which the auditor happens to hear about. But whatever theirsource may be: they have to be presented in writing to the C/S so that he may work out hissolutions for the case in question, on their basis.Principally, there are two types of interviews. One concerns the totality of the pc’s life andforms the basis of the case analysis and the Life Repair program. The list of questions followingafter the next section gives a good example of it. The other relates to specific situations, forexample when the pc or student doesn’t seem to make any progress on his auditing program, hiscourse or his ethics program, and the C/S wants to find out how he is doing. This latter interviewusually has the simple form of a Two Way Comm on the question: “How are you doing in yourcurrent auditing?” (or whatever).HOW TO DO AN INTERVIEWThe interviewer asks the pc about a specific situation in his life or in his previous auditing,or about his life in general. Usually he has a list of questions worked out by the C/S. It is his job toget a full answer to each question. As long as he hasn’t clearly grasped the life situation of the pcyet, he does not fully acknowledge his answer.The interviewer keeps at his question until he has got it. Then only does he acknowledgeand go to the next question. (The question or the answers have to read, of course. ) As you are notdoing repetitive auditing here, you ought to rephrase the question when you repeat it. You are notdoing a “Two-Way Comm to F/N” either, which is a process. You are doing a “Two Way Commfor data”.Sometimes the pc may start talking as if he were already in session. Do not allow this tohappen. As soon as you have grasped the situation you tell him: “Thank you. I have fullyunderstood the situation you are in. The charge on it will get handled in session, not now.” -Andyou go to the next question. All with good ARC, naturally.Be curious about the other person’s life; get all the data. The product of a good interview:the interviewer has grasped the life and the time track of the pc so well that he could write adocumentary screen play about it.A QUESTIONNAIRE FOR THE INTRODUCTORY INTERVIEWWhen you do an interview you may ask many questions, as many as you like, but there isonly one thing you want to know: what is the pc’s ideal scene in life, what is his existing scene,and how far does the existing scene depart from the ideal scene? You want to help the pc close thatgap; that’s the only reason why you audit him."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"113This particular questionnaire addresses new clients, who know nothing about scientology,as well as dyed-in-the-wool ‘veterans” .

To get them out of the way, it should be evaluated accordingly.Question 1 asks directly for the pc’s life ruin. Here you often find the highest-charged area.Qu. 2 gets at ruins which may be socially embarrassing to talk about. As well it revealsdestructive intentions.Qu. 3 has the pc re-construct his time track. This step in itself may cause quite somerealizations and relief, too, as it creates order, certainty and orientation where before there wasdisorder or unawareness.Qu. 4 It broadens the information received in Qu. 3 and opens areas of charge the pc didn’tthink of yet. - It is important to get losses AND wins.

He has a “wrong item” (see Tech Dict.)Qu. 9, 10, 11 and 12 check into the resistive case points of “drugs”, “seriously physicallyill”, “PTS”, “former therapies” and “other practices”.

The answerscan be quite amazing.Qu. 15 and 16 reveal glibness and superficiality in his past scientology training, as well asinvalidation’s due to out-tech.Qu. 17 will shed light on certain case peculiarities - for example that the person has alreadygone up to Clear or even OTIII in his last life and therefore has no particular interest in the lowerbridge yet at the same time demonstrates an uncanny knowledgeability of things he wouldn’t beexpected to know."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"116Qu. l8 When the pc does not want what this question is asking for, when he does not wishto become freer and spiritually more able, but only wants to be “cured” of something, it may wellbe that he is using a SerFac to make auditing wrong, to ‘ prove” to you that it does not work.When he has no goals beyond curing his stomach ulcers, he is - quite paradoxically - likely to keephis stomach ulcers under all circumstances, because it is the only thing by which he can attractinterest. With you, the auditor, he does the same: he tries - in an aberrated way - to attract yourinterest. Perhaps there is nobody left in the whole wide world who would take an interest in him.So he pays you for listening. However, should his ulcers get cured, he would run out of a topic forconversation; therefore he cannot allow them to be cured! In order to resolve such a paradoxicalsituation, you, as C/S or auditor, need quite a bit of experience. Do not take such a person onunless you trust yourself to get a result. Here is a question you could ask in order to decide whetherto take the case on or not: “Supposing your ulcers had disappeared, what would you do in lifewhich you cannot do now because of the ulcers?” When the pc has a positive answer to this, hehas as well a superior goal; making the ulcers disappear would therefore be a necessary andrealistic sub-goal to him. With him you could easily work. But when he says: “Don’t know. Inever thought that far ahead. I’ll start thinking about it when my ulcers are gone.” - then you hadbetter be careful.Qu. 19 You may get indicators for a false or incorrect Clear attest in the past, foruncertainties, eval and inval regarding Clear.Qu. 20 detects false data.

Note the reads down with them. A pattern will emerge once youhave noted down the first dozen or so. In the end you can tell that the fifty or eighty origination’sthe pc has given, spiral around five or six ruin areas only.Step 2: Take a new sheet and group the origination’s together in terms of areas. Husbandreads, first marriage reads. That’s one area: second dynamic. Then there’s the 7th dynamic:interested in magic, talks to the spirits of the dead; has done yoga and meditated. That’s anotherarea. Then there is his business not doing well. A third area. And so on. Sometimes the areas youfind will coincide with the dynamics; sometimes there will be more than one area to a givendynamic.Step 3: Add up the reads in each area. To do so, you must determine the “blowdown-value” of each read. How much TA-blowdown is caused by a Fall? By a sF? By a LF? Thisdepends on the sensitivity used and on your type of E-meter. - Procedure: Put the needle on “set”with the sensitivity used in the interview and the TA on 2. Move the TA gently up. The needle willstart falling. When it has reached the width defined for the sF you can tell how much TAmovement went into this sF. It may not be more than 0.05 divisions on a sensitivity of 3. But tensF’s make a total blowdown of 0.5 divisions, and that’s a lot! (This is why you need to note downeach and every read as it occurs in the interview. )Step 4: You have now worked out the amount of charge for each area. There will be one ortwo highly charged ones, three or four lesser ones, and a number of “stray reads” which stand forthemselves. Arrange it all in the sequence of magnitude of charge. This is the sequence of youractual program, too. All that’s left to do is to find out which process you’ll have to use to “crack”each area.Steps 2 and 4 in a way relate to data evaluation. (See Data Evaluation Series in the greenManagement Volumes.) You have found outpoints (reading items) and pluspoints (non-readingand F/Ning items) . You put all the outpoints together to find the area which departs the most fromthe ideal scene, and propose a handling: the auditing process you are going to use in session. (SeeLogic 13, in “Scn 0-8”.)Step 5: Now try your tools on the areas found. What to use exactly is hard to say as itdepends a lot on your previous experience, the previous experience of the pc, the complexity of thesituation, the daringness of the auditor. You could use an L1C, six ruds or a prepcheck on the 2D-situation mentioned in Step 2; you could single out one BD-item (first marriage) and work on itseparately before getting into the general area of the 2D; you could cool off the general aspect firstwith an L1C on “your 2D” and then pick out the particulars. It is so much up to the individualconstellation of facts and circumstances that only general advice can be given. A catch-all is “6Ruds on the 2D, done repetitively till they F/N on calling them. “ -A more specific one:“Prepcheck on the 2D, lock-scan each BD item that shows up, to postulate and F/N; continue"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"118prepcheck this way till all compulsive attention is off the 2D.” - One for those who can do L&N:“Who or what would represent the 2D to you?”; get the BD F/N item and do 6 ruds or aprepcheck on it, then clean up the 2D in general with an L1C taken to F/Ning list.Past wins, abilities once had and somehow lost, life purposes which were never attained are- naturally - done with rehab tech. Always make sure the item you are rehabbing is exactly wordedto a big read or BD (see “itsa”); it will run all by itself then.AUDITING AND C/SingDo not worry about actually making one of the ten thousand possible mistakes one couldmake in auditing, or about making your pc worse than he is. You cannot audit something the bankis not willing to give out. You can only audit what’s available. The biggest reading item is the onemost available to be run. Should you have made a mistake in arranging the sequence of chargedareas or in the selection of processes you are using on them, well, the worst that can happen is:nothing. As long as you are not forcing the pc, no damage can be done. And if you only listen towhat the pc’s attention is on, you’ll soon know what’s available, and that’s what you run. Any ofthe processes presented in Part Three of this handbook applied to any of the pc’s areas of charge,will blow charge and - therefore - increase awareness. They are all workable - which isn’t to saythat your use of them will always be elegant or artful. Their correct application to the right item - sothat they hit like a bomb - requires experience. Artfulness comes with time.Just do it and keep doing it. Audit hundreds and hundreds of hours. See what your toolscan do for the case. Get to know them. And, little by little, you’ll be able to predict how the casewill react to a certain approach. You will be able to calculate your moves against the bank like amaster chess-player predicting his enemy a dozen moves in advance. And then you’ll be a C/S.The C/S must be able to predict. He determines the longterm strategy of dealing with this case. Theauditor makes this strategy come true in each of his sessions. He uses on-the-spot tactics andflexibility. The C/S is the strategist, the auditor the tactician.To briefly summarize the sequence of action in its simplicity, no matter whether it applies toa one-man-band or to a larger setup: The interviewer does his interview. The C/S works out aprogram of perhaps eight or ten major steps . The auditor takes the pc in session and works on thesteps prescribed by the C/S. When they bite, all is well. When they don’t bite, or half-bite, it maybe due to the auditor’s inability to realize the program step in session, or to the program stepunexpectedly not paralleling the pc’s case. Either way, the auditor ends the session after the EP orwhen it does not go, and writes it up: he puts numbers on his worksheets, summarizes the sessioncontent on the Auditor’s Report Form, writes his comment in red and his next C/S in blue and fillsout the Folder Summary. Then he hands his folder in to the C/S who reads through the worksheetsand gives his comments. Either he accepts the auditor’s proposition for the next C/S withoutchanging it in any way, or he corrects it, or gives an entirely new and different instruction. Shouldthe auditor have overlooked something or made a technical mistake, the C/S gives him a shortstudy program to avoid a repetition of the same situation. If the auditor’s C/S was accepted, he cango back in session right away. However, if he was given a study program, he has to work itthrough before being allowed to audit further. The jargon term for this form of teaching is“cramming”. The C/S himself needs cramming occasionally, for example when he has failed to"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"119solve one or even several cases. In a larger set-up he would usually have a “Senior C/S” pickingup his mistakes and correcting him. Lacking such a person, he would look around for some otherC/S whose abilities he trusts, and consult him. So the “correction of the corrector” is done on avoluntary basis here. (He would be ill advised not to do it, because sooner or later his customerswill stay away!)How long does it take to become a professional? Five thousand well done auditing hours tobecome technically proficient, ten thousand to understand what it is all about.PC Gone Clear?How can you tell when your pc has gone Clear? And, if so, what do you do?Here are some typical indicators: pc has had a successful Life Repair, is now on the Gradesbut has little TA action and no interest in the auditing; has lots of false reads and runs entitiesinstead of own incidents; says he has more wins on study than in auditing; blows charge byinspection; can handle somatics at will out of session and without an E-meter; keeps askingquestions about the solo-levels. But he doesn’t think or say that he might be Clear. Or he does sayso. Now what do you do? Answer: leave it up to an experienced C/S.Of course it may happen that your pc has had a big win or release and just thinks he’s goneClear because he doesn’t understand the technicalities of it. In this case you do a rehab on therelease, explain the whole thing to the pc and carry on with your program. However, if your pcdoes have the indicators mentioned above, you should delegate the case to a C/S who has alreadydone his OT III.Why? Before Clear you have a being who is identified with his composite case. When hegoes Clear he understands that he is himself, that he is mocking up his own pictures and therebycauses his own troubles himself. But he doesn’t quite understand yet what it is exactly that existsalong with him, i.e. the entities of the composite case. In C/Sing a Clear Check, you must be ableto discriminate between “own charge” and “others’ charge” . This moves you close to the C/Singstyle used on the Solo-levels. To get experience in this field, there is only one way: the C/S musthave solo-audited successfully himself. This is why your Clear Check ought to be C/Sed by anOTIII C/S.It’s always advisable for the C/S to be at least one level up from the level he is C/Sing. TheC/S C/Sing OTIII should himself have completed Excalibur the C/S C/Sing Excalibur should havecompleted his case for good. -This is a safeguard to make sure that the C/S doesn’t dramatize hisown case and project his problems into the case of the pc.To let the cat out of the bag at least a little, a brief sketch of a possible approach to the ClearCheck is now suggested. It is based on the Pre-Havingness Scale [1]. This scale, plus the reasonwhy it has been chosen for the Clear Check, needs explaining before we get to the actual process."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"120The Pre-Havingness Scale ranges from Havingness, through various levels of attempts andfailures to obtain it, to complete failure to be able to have. It describes a downward trend. To givean example of the logic of it: Supposing there is Havingness on a particular subject and somethingunpleasant happens, Failed Havingness, the next level down, would be the result. This would leadto interest in the subject, one further level down. This interest, if successfully pursued, would takeone up the scale again to restored Havingness. If the interest fails (next level down), there will bethe intention to be in Communication with the subject (again one level down) and should thatattempt fail, the wish for Control will result. If that fails, you get the desire to Help. And so on,level by level, down to the aberrated levels of Inverted Help, Inverted Control, InvertedCommunication and Inverted Interest. “Inverted” in this context would mean “turning back ononeself”, like the shot that goes off into one’s face instead of leaving the barrel. It means achievingthe opposite of what is wanted. The inverted levels on the scale could possibly be interpreted as“knocked out of the game but still compulsively trying to participate somehow”, or “honestlyattempting to play along, but unintentionally achieving the opposite of what the game is actuallyabout”. (An example of this is given in Charlie Chaplin’s films. They all play at the bottom end ofthis scale . That people have an endless number of buttons in context with inverted help, controland communication, is demonstrated by the timeless success of these movies.)When there is afailure on even these levels, one drops to the bottom of the scale with Obsessive Can’t Have andultimately the conviction that one can create No Effect at all.What does this have to do with doing a Clear Check? Well, it puts the pc to a test. He sayshe is Clear - now does that mean that there is no charge on his timetrack he couldn’t handle byhimself, or could it merely be that he is not aware of further areas of charge due to non-confront?This needs finding out. You cannot find it out by doing yet another interview, because the pc hasoriginated all inconsistencies he is aware of; he is well in tune with himself and his life. So youmust challenge him. This is done by clarifying with him the concept of each level on the Pre-Havingness Scale . When the clarification on a particular level does not F/N, you know that theremust be something behind it, i.e. a non-confronted terminal or item. So you find out who or whatthat is. Then you trace it down to the incident which caused the situation, by Postulate Auditing. Itwill soon become apparent whether you are dealing with the pc’s own charge or with an entity.The result of this approach would be: hidden pockets of own charge cleaned up; remaining yetunrecognized valences discovered and erased or disconnected from; pc certain about having nofurther charge of his own that he could not as-is by merely confronting it. He would “blow it byinspection”.With this Clear Check the pc has the opportunity to demonstrate that he “can be at causeknowingly and at will over mental matter, energy, space and time as regards the first dynamic(survival for self) “ [2]. The Pre-Havingness Scale covers all possible areas of unviewed charge hecould still have at this stage. Now the pc can attest Clear with full certainty and knowledge.THE CLEAR CHECK1. Prerequisites:1.1 The pc is on the whole in agreement with his life. He has things under control. He is future-oriented and optimistic. His life does not follow a roller-coaster course but is on a steady"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"121upward trend. He understands the basic knowledge of scientology tech, admin and ethicsand applies it in life.1.2 Should the above condition not be fully prevalent, i.e. should the pc still be troubled by thisor that, it would be found in auditing him - if he really is a Clear - that he is beinginfluenced by entities. There would be unmistakable evidence that his troubles do not stemfrom home-made charge from his own time track.Before he can be allowed to attest and go on the solo levels, his troubles would needhandling, though, by disconnecting him as much as possible from the entities botheringhim. The techniques to be used conveniently would be either D/L for a light key-out, orPostulate Auditing for finding out what he does to keep the entity connected to him . )2. Procedure Steps:After having cleaned up all personal charge and all immediately troublesome entitiesaccording to 1.2, and after having attained the condition described in 1.1 above, the steadfastnessof the person presumed to be Clear is put to a test.2.1 Do a slow assessment of the Pre-Havingness Scale, starting at the top. What does eachlevel mean to the pc as a general concept; what does it mean to him personally? Get him totell you.2.2 When there has been no F/N on one level or the other, you would first see how muchcharge is on each one of them (by counting up the reads). Then, beginning with the biggestreading one, you would ask: “Who or what could you . . .?”, filling in the item in question.For the first level on the scale this would be worded as: “Who or what could you easilyhave?” The ones below that would be worded like: “Who or what would you fail tohave?”, “. . . would you be interested in?”, “. . . would you fail to be interested in?”, andso on.According to the rules of Listing & Nulling, you should get a BD F/N item as an answer toyour question. L & N questions are worded to allow for only one item to be the answer tothe question. The pc will make a list of items which come to his mind, some of them willread, there may be a slight communication lag, and then suddenly he comes up with theitem, has a BD followed by an F/N and laughs. This is not difficult at all, provided yourTR-0 and your TR-2 are good.2.3 Now you find the underlying incident. Supposing you had not received an F/N on clearingthe level of “failed interest”, had done your L&N-process and received the item “apples”,you would now ask: “Recall the earliest time you can when you failed to be interested inapples” . Proceed according to Postulate Auditing procedure . (For a briefer and moresuperficial handling you could branch off at this point and do a D/L.)2.4 Be very observant of the session getting efforty or unreal. In this case you immediatelyhave to find the correct authorship for the incident you are running. Should you be dealingwith a restimulated entity (instead of a mere non-confront of own charge), you audit itnarrative style until it disconnects or “dissolves in thin air”."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"1222.5 The EP of the action is a cognition of the pc about his relationship to the composite case,with him being certain about his ability to create and un-create charge of his own. This mayoccur even before the whole scale has been done. If there is any doubt, it’s worth doing afew more levels and risking an overrun, rather than doing too little and staying superficial.3. The actual check-up on Clear:Now clear the definitions 1-9 of “Clear” with the pc, in the Tech Dictionary. Tailor themto suit the first dynamic as not all are formulated that way. Have the pc give you examplesdemonstrating that he can act that way. It is he who has to “come up with the evidence”. Thedefinitions must F/N. (His sessions of the past count of course as “evidence”, too.)3.1 Now 6 Ruds “concerning Clear” are taken to F/N, to do away with any last doubts orreservations on the part of the pc.3.2 Now ask the pc: “When did you go Clear?” Pick this question up only when it is charged.This will be so when the pc has been Clear for quite some time already, without anyonehaving noticed or acknowledged it, or when he attained Clear in his last life. (Which mightbe the reason for much of the joyless auditing he had! Nothing but O/R and false reads.)In order to rehabilitate the state, it is sufficient to find the exact point in time when it wasattained (perhaps by using a D/L) and to then polish it up nicely with rehab-tech.4. Attest:The “pc” attests to being “Clear on the 1st dynamic” .5. Instruction:He gets full instructions about the composite case and about solo-auditing dealingexclusively with entities. The best basis for this instruction would be HCOB 30. July 1980,“The Nature of a Being”.6. Result:The Clear feels competent to handle the remainder of his case, i.e. his entities, as a solo-auditor. (Should he not say anything to that effect by himself, one ought to ask him in aninterview.)(Usually you would find some source references at this point. But there aren’t any worthmentioning. The two attempts by the CofS to “make Clears”, the “Dianetic Clear SpecialIntensive” or DCSI, later turned into the “Clear Certainty Rundown” or CCRD, are both toomuch of a joke as to be seriously discussed or referred to. For those who wish to convincethemselves: the DCSI you find in Tech Vol.XII; for the CCRD, which has not been issuedpublicly, it is sufficient to ask the victims.)"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"123Ethics-MeasuresEthics is to be applied with not more strength than needed to make the fulfillment of one’sgoals possible. There is no hardship and no ideology connected with it. Everything is just fine aslong as the pc does whatever is necessary to attain the ideal scene he has postulated for himself.Products in life tell the tale. “Ethics: that which is enforced by oneself, his belief in his own honorand good reason, an optimum solution along the eight dynamics” [2] . It is the use of reasontowards optimum survival.We are not here to impose the morals of society or our own scientological convictions onthe pc. We are here to enable him to find out for himself what’s right for him. Ethics should neverbe used as an other-determinism on the pc; it should increase his self-determinism.Therefore, speaking from a practical viewpoint, the C/S shouldn’t worry about anything inthe pc’s life as long as it does not interrupt his progress in the direction of Clear - no matter whatopinions and feelings the C/S personally may have regarding the pc’s doings. From a Clear,however, one would expect that he is well in control of his life. Someone who expects his solo-levels to be a remedy for his life problems, is a pretty low-grade Clear or maybe not a Clear at all.And he will soon be in trouble on solo. At the point of Clear, then, the C/S must look at the life ofthe pc before giving him the ok to continue.The theory of the bridge implies that a being will act increasingly rationally as he is gettingrid of his bank. His ability to find sane solutions can be expected to rise to the extent that he lets goof his fixation on aberrated solutions. This means that you will need very little ethics handling asyou take the pc up the bridge - as long as you are producing technical results on him. Because ofbad tech the pc’s life may go up and down which makes it look as if he had an “unusual case”.(See “roller-coastering” in the Tech Dict.) For this reason the pc folder must be seen by the C/Sbefore the pc is sent to the ethics consultant.The other reasons for “ups and downs” are lack of data, missing know-how, false data, oruneducatedness in the activity one is failing in - maybe even a disability in mastering the three R’s(reading, writing, arithmetic). So at some point or other an education job will need to get done onsuch a person.When the pc’s activities in life amount to a real present time problem (PTP), it must behandled for real - with the tools of ethics. With all the auditing hours in the world you cannotexpect to handle a real-life present-time ethics situation. A rather obvious example may serve toillustrate the point: a husband beats his wife every night he comes home from the bar. His wife getsauditing to handle the situation. You audit her to a win. She goes home, her husband beats her upas usual. The next day she has more auditing. Goes home, gets beaten up. And so on. Doesn’twork, you see?Any subjective problem (the considerations in the pc’s own universe) is handled withauditing tech. Now that the charge is gone and the pc is able to confront his life better, it may turnout that there is as well an objective part to the problem. This is the appropriate moment for the pc"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"124to have an ethics consultation. When a handling which was agreed upon has been actually anddemonstrably done, auditing can be successfully resumed without any further distraction.Example: The PC has problems handling money. After completing the respective auditingcycle he may have no more charge on his overts and withholds on the subject of money, but he stillcannot handle it. Why should he, after all? Perhaps he has never learned it!An alert C/S picks up the situation before it can build up steam and keeps it fromdeveloping by using all the tools at his disposal, not only auditing. He must predict; that’s his job."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"125From Clear On UpIn this book, the most common auditing methods from Life Repair to Clear have beenpresented to you. To say more - in simple words - would be hard, because from here on up on thebridge the application of the tech becomes so differentiated that its description would go beyondthe limits of this text. The skill required in steering a thetan through his composite case to a point ofcase completion, can only be attained after auditing and C/Sing some dozens of cases successfullyup to Clear, and after having done the solo-levels oneself, too - with personal gains. It takes aprofessional to understand the upper bridge.What makes things difficult, too, is the unavailability of reference materials . The levels OTI-III have always been kept confidential by the CofS, and rightly so as they may be restimulative tosome people and one doesn’t want to run the risk. (A bit of mystery makes for better selling, too.)In order to talk in detail about the ins and outs of solo-auditing and solo-C/Sing, one would need afull set of the OTI-III scripts. They cannot be reprinted here for the reason stated, and because ofcopyright violations. They can easily be obtained, though, from most non CofS centers. Yet themere fact of having them doesn’t help. It takes experience to understand them and apply them to agood result for oneself or the solo-auditor one is C/Sing.Now, in the 90’s, giving someone the OT III materials to read may not put him at risk anylonger. After roughly two million solo auditing hours (at least) on OT III and Excalibur, donebetween 1968 and 1988, this part of the case has gone pretty flat. This is demonstrated by solo-auditors today not being restimulated by OTIII as much as they were up to 1988. The same is truefor the levels below OTIII. R6EW, the C.C., OTII - they were a fighting matter at the time theycame out, they took hundreds of hours for each solo-auditor who did them. Today they don’t pusha button any more in most people . These levels have gone flat on the 4th dynamic. Bits of themmay still show in individual cases (1st dynamic) but the general phenomenon is that the Earth casehas gone flat, at least the Xenu part of it. There are other things showing up now which aren’tstraight OT III or Excalibur, yet can only be understood and handled in these terms, i.e. withreference to Xenu’s game.This is not to underestimate the value of these levels. For one person they may not domuch, yet the next person may have a tremendous amount of charge tied up in the composite caseand in his whole unviewed involvement with other beings and entities. When he is Clear he is inshape to start really dealing with it. The auditing techniques available to dig deep into this make forextraordinary gains, no denying it.The C/S must know his tools inside out and be flexible, that’s all one would need to say.He must work on the case as it presents itself to him here and now, and not confuse it with somecase example Hubbard gave years ago for instructional purposes. The C/S bears greatresponsibility; his knowledge must match up to it or he won’t be able to control and predict thecase he is C/Sing. Much as the OT III materials are rendered relatively “harmless” now, theyshouldn’t be thrown on the market wholesale as they may be picked up by “C/Ses” who weren’tsteeped in the experience of a few thousand hours of auditing on the lower bridge and who aretherefore liable to use the data to the detriment of their public. And to the detriment of the subject"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"126itself - because as long as quackery and dilettantism are tolerated in scientology, there will benobody wishing to grant it any acceptance in science and society.But let us return to the “upper bridge”. What is it really? The answer most readily given is:“the OT levels”. Even in this book we have used this as an answer without worrying too muchabout its validity. Yet it is not a proper answer, because there was no proper question! To speak ofthe upper bridge merely in terms of the OT levels, wouldn’t do any justice to the different needs ofindividuals, their different awareness and pace. The CofS has for a long time encouraged a fictionof “OT” as an undefined yet specific magical state where all powers are restored and eternalfreedom is regained. Or something like that. And that the OT-levels will take you there, when theyare finally issued and when you have paid for them. This isn’t a bridge at all of course, but it istheir hold on people and their undoing.The correct question we ought to ask is: where do we want to go; where is a bridge meantto take us? Generally speaking, auditing results in a greater sense of identity for the person whohad it. He feels backed up by the experience of a few hundred lifetimes, he senses greater depthand feels more settled within himself. He understands his present as the result of things left undonein the past. To the extent that he knows his goal and can tackle the tasks connected therewithsuccessfully, he will be happy, for the definition of happiness is: “the overcoming of notunknowable obstacles towards a known goal” (“The Fundamental Axioms of Dianetics” in [2].)Which implies three possibilities for his further development: when he fails, becausefreedoms, barriers and purposes have become unbalanced and things took an unfavorable turnagainst him and his game, he will want more auditing. He has failed ethically and now he wantshelp to become “repaired”. When he is happy with his life, and keeps on being happy, he won’tdream of ever getting audited again. Or, after having become so stabilized on his new level ofknowledge and awareness and having explored it to its limits, he may become curious to find outmore. He may wish to get a good C/S and pick up the solo-cans again in order to work outanswers. He has found new and higher goals, new freedoms, but along with them new obstacles,too. This sort of expansion one would expect from someone playing his game ethically.Looking at auditing as a general growth process towards ultimate beingness, doingness andhavingness, there is an end to the bridge only at that final point when the thetan has done it all andseen it all, completed his self-determined mission and sees no further reason for his own existence.Auditing certainly abbreviates the time it would take to get there, but it is no substitute for thecorresponding activities. The incomplete cycles, the overts and withholds, the “bad karma” of thepast once they have been taken away from one’s own universe, it is so much easier to strive, in the“real” world, for the final attainment of one’s basic goal in one’s current cycle of existence’s. Andhow long would it take? A few lifetimes? Some thousands of years? As much time into the futureas it took from the moment one entered the mest universe, to the present? How long does it take tocomplete a cycle of action? It takes as long as it takes. “Time is the primary source of untruth”(Ax. 43) . The main thing is to keep growing in terms of quality, not in terms of speed.A true bridge would have to be adaptable to this pattern of growth in a smooth and organicfashion. It certainly isn’t that the pc goes “up the bridge” in a straight line! Not at all. The keyitems of his life as a thetan, his reason for being in the game at all, will keep re-appearing in evermore subtle form. Auditing therefore can be viewed as an upward spiral much rather than as abridge. You will see the pc going through the same sort of thing again and again, each time on a"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"127finer level, until finally he has solved the “riddle of his existence” sufficiently to play happilyalong towards the end of his games cycle.Much as it may be different from individual to individual, there is still a recognizablepattern in this. To start with, one is usually dealing with Flow 1 and Flow 2: what have others doneto one, what has one done to them? The result of that is a Clear who can keep himself clean on the1st dynamic. After that follows a long stretch of Flow 3: what have others done to others? This isthe subject of the OT levels proper, where one audits the entities of the composite case, created bypowerful forces on the intergalactic battlefield. With that done, this subject matter has lost itsimpressiveness to the solo-auditor. He can have it. By that time, entities have become about assolid and visible to him as the lamps in a beer garden. From now on his attention will graduallyturn to Flow 0: what has he done to himself to become who he is now? This is perhaps the mostimportant one. A thetan, in the final analysis, has created himself by postulates. Everything elsedepends on this. Whatever attitude or consideration, principle, concept or policy he has once usedsuccessfully or saw others use successfully, he collected and kept, all along the track since thatmoment when he created himself - a moment which is far away as well as now. And along with ithe created and stored some working installations; they allow him, amongst other useful things, todrive a car, write, recite the alphabet and play the violin, without him having to put too muchattention on it (circuits).The thetan always keeps one finger, as it were, on his awareness of himself as a static, andit is from this knowledge that he can consider that even the most positive structures that aid hisgame play are but fabrications, and he should be able to as-is or change them at will. One’sinvolvement’s with bodies, use of mental constructions at all, reliance on mest for communicationcould be, where it is not a matter of free choice, considered “case” and therefore subject to theneed for a bridge.These are of course structures across all the dynamics, and our bridge doesn’t penetrate thatfar (yet), not withstanding CofS selling tactics. After dealing with all obvious reactive bank, afterexhausting “negative gain”, there still remain the positive characteristics, the mental attributes thatone has accepted as “oneself”.You probably have noticed that the point we are getting to, is the analytical mind, knownas well as a man’s “character” or “personality”, perhaps as his “ego”. It’s what he mockedhimself up to be. And it’s what he is going to keep on being, exactly as long as it takes him tounmock himself again.According to the two “Rights of a Thetan” it is up to each individual to leave his games ina manner determined by him alone. This is not a collective endeavor where all, in step with eachother, would go through the same phases of development. One doesn’t have to wait until the othersare ready. Only each one for himself can make up his mind with regard to his rate of progress, canknow what is left to be done by him until he can attain the state beyond all games.And a bridge is only as good as it takes you there."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"128Author’s PostscriptWhat I have tried to do in the two volumes of this book is to present a distillation of myexperience with scientology, of what I found valid and workable, so that one may be able to freelytalk about it without being forced into agreements and conclusions, and without cringing inwardly.This experience has three aspects: that of studying and being audited, that of applying it in myprivate life, my family and, naturally, my job, and lastly that of having become a member of amovement which I consider vitally important in cultural and humanitarian respects. When I startedto become interested in scientology, it appeared to promise insights into the connectedness betweenman and his mind far beyond any comparable system I was aware of. This promise has been kept.My studies into, and personal experiences with, western psychology, eastern philosophy, yoga andmeditation were, prior to that, of great importance to me but turned out to have been onlypreliminaries, for when I finally hit upon scientology, it allowed me, retrospectively, to fullypenetrate the earlier disciplines.In the many years I have worked with scientology, I was not alone but with a number ofothers at various times, first inside the CofS and then outside, both as an auditor using the techindividually, and helping to train others in its use . (A double function which is practiced by mostauditors in the CofS independent field.)The reason to write all this down was partly to clear my head of the whole thing at a pointwhere I felt I finally got on top of it, but also because of the realization that it could well serve auseful purpose in helping others to understand something that is not that easy to grasp fromavailable materials.Personally I feel it is our joint responsibility to care for the immense achievement that RonHubbard’s work represents, and to exhaust all its possibilities. It is the responsibility of all thosewho feel a mental response to his thoughts. One should not by any means leave this up to the CofSalone. A glance in your daily paper will tell you what results they are getting and how far adriftthey are.As soon as you take the viewpoint that you are responsible for something, it becomes easierto comprehend it and to identify areas that need further clarification. It is probably this that hasenabled us outside the CofS to resolve various aspects of the tech, particularly about the upper partof the bridge, that were left incomplete by Hubbard and were proving dissatisfactory in practice.This, and the fact that no-one in the CofS is allowed to contribute to the subject, which they thinkwas Hubbard’s job, and they believe he completed it. So there is nothing that ever came from theirside, no further thoughts, no reflections, critical discussions, whatever, and one would not expectanything to come from them in the future.It seems very much so that we were right in taking on this responsibility. One example forthat is the reach of the bridge as it is delivered outside the CofS, and the results obtained. This istrue in particular for Bill Robertson’s “Excalibur” which certainly does reach parts of the case that“NOTs”, the CofS’s equivalent, cannot reach. As well, the standard of a “case completion” iswholly unknown in the CofS.
