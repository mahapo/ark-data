Sea-weed whipped and wound and unwound onthe taut, protesting cables as they draggedan object toward the beach from under thesea.The intensity of the watching grouphad no eye for the beauty of the scene; thesoft purling of the small waves, the sooth-ing whisper of the tropical wind, the distantclatter of a palm, the rich gold of sand andcrystal aquamarine of water might as wellhave been a tourist poster in a waste basket.The rigid cordon of Marines, facingoutward, automatic weapons in hand, hadfierce eyes against any threatened intrusioninto the site. VIPs that must not be ap-proached, an object that was top secret anda sergeant with a hangover increased theirtrigger-happy vigilance.Several supercilious scientists gazedbenignly at the water, tolerantly and learn-edly waiting for the object to appear, hop-ing no one had penetrated the fact that theyhadn’t a clue.Jedgar, the jut-jawed czar of all US po-lice and security forces scowled with feroc-ity at the water.God damn president, he ought to havehis ass kicked, getting him out here forwhat. God damn hobby-happy bastard. Soit’s an historical find. So it may be fromouter space. Sand fleas when he had an ap-pointment at the race track with Bennie theDip. $30,000 payoff via the window.Damned junkie, he’d probably blow it orforget it. What the hell was he doing outhere playing nursemaid to his nibs’ craphobby? Nursemaid, that’s what he was.God damn president. Bennie better pay up.Jedgar glared at the water as though aboutto arrest it on suspicion.On the other side of the groaning cablessat a disconsolate young man in a scubasuit. He twisted his helmet and mask in hishands around and around. While he mighthave the nerve to face the monsters of thedeep, what were those compared to US of-ficials. Damned government. He ought tohave kept his mouth shut. No breaks. Healways lucked out. Here he’d made the find,personally and privately and even paid forhis own bike gas and air. Well, an orphan isan orphan. Still, there was law about own-ership. You couldn’t give up just like that.One more try. If it didn’t work...The young man braced himself, got tohis feet and wiped some of the sand off hispants. How would John Wayne handle thison the late-late show? One more try.The young man ducked under thegrowling cables and walked up to Jedgarwho gave him not a glance.Now or never. ”It’s mine! I insist it’smine! I found it. If it weren’t for me youwouldn’t even know of its existence!”Jedgar did not even take his eyes offthe water. He put out an arm and brushedthe young man sideways.The leading scientist of the group foundhis own view obstructed. He never wore“glasses despite needing them as theyspoiled his image of the tawnymaned manof science. He peered at the young man. Inhis benign voice, reserved for assistants heintended to fire, he said, ”You don’t under-stand. Such finds as this belong to the worldof science, to the museums, to the universi-ties.”Having registered now that there was adispute, Jedgar tore his eyes from the waterand stabbed them at the young man.Reaching out with a sudden and practicedcop hand, he seized the front of the youngman’s scuba suit.”You give me any more crap,” Jedgaryanked the young man close to him, ”andyou’ll be charged with conspiracy to stealarcheological treasures. Section 896. Three"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS3years in jail. Not one more word out of you.Not to the public! Not to your friends! Notto the press!” He hurled the young manfrom him violently so that he staggered andfell.”This,” pronounced Jedgar, ”is a statematter.”The young man looked up from theground, defeated. He looked out to where agovernment scuba diver was guiding in thecables. There was no sympathy there. Helooked at the tense Marine backs. Helooked at the scientists. He looked at Jed-gar. He was totally, completely and utterlyignored. He had never felt more lonely.He got up and unsteadily wanderedacross the sand. Head down, shuffling, hewent out through the cordon and wanderedaway through the distant crowd.The winch cables groaned on, coilingand twisting. The government scuba diverwatched the cables. The group on the sandstared, waiting.A greenish sea-coated metal object be-gan to emerge.It had no bolt studs, no apparentseams. It was many planed, symmetrical.First one, then two, then a the eight footdiameter of it came into full view.”All right!” yelled Jedgar. ”Let’s get thething loaded on a plane.” Maybe he couldstill get to the race track.Washington the fair, Washington thebeautiful, home of the incorruptible politi-cian and the shining knights of social justice,basked in the summer sun, owned, operatedand controlled as usual by the bankers andtheir police.The Institute sat on a low hill, securelybacked by the printing plant that pouredthe newly printed money into the hands ofthe deserving few. As much summer sun ascould get through the smog entered the win-dows of a large hall and fell upon the object.All eight feet of it had been placedagainst one wall. It had been polished up abit – at least the sand had been removed. Ithad two small panels, oblong sealed rectan-gles, much like slitted eyes and theseseemed to stare blindly into the hall facingit, waiting.Several feet in front of it, Jedgar and theleading scientist stood. The President, whohad just arrived with his usual escort, joinedthem.Excitement agitated the President’seyes. Ever since he had been a little boy hehad been interested in such things. It mightbe something from outer space, it might besome archeological wonder. He had strictlyforbidden them to tinker with it. These sci-entists monkeyed so. Who knows but whatit might be some discovery he could claimthe patronage for and help his votes andshow he was an intellectual. Maybe some-body would work out its secrets and makesome great new weapon he could use as abig stick. Maybe it held secrets that wouldblow everything up. His background train-ing for his hobby consisted of a chemistryset somebody had given him at the age often and which he had used mainly to makeexplosives.The President took his eyes off theobject and looked around. ”And what havewe guessed so far?” The leading scientist swept back histawny hair, which he hoped would come tolook like Einstein’s. It didn’t much matterwhat he told the President so long as itadded up to new grants for the Institute andnew honors for himself. ”Well, Mr. Presi-dent, we’re not at all sure what it is. It musthave been imbedded in a cliff side and whenthat fell into the sea, it exposed itself. I’mhaving it analyzed now.” And he pointed tothe right of the object.Beyond the object a table of instru-ments had been set up – those used in car-bon half-life estimations of age, radiation"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS4detection, electrical detonators – all strewnabout in disorderly jury-rigs. White-coatedand serious, the instrument man wassearching through the scattered papers andgetting them in some kind of order.”All right,” said the instrument techni-cian, ”I think I’ve got it.” He frowned heav-ily at a note. ”It’s some kind of alloy wehave never achieved.”The leading scientist nodded and said,”Yes,” hoping it sounded as though he knewit already.”The instrument technician pulled a wadof tape out of the notes and, with some dif-ficulty, stretched it out. ”This is stretchingour equipment, but I’d say that, accordingto the carbon age test, this thing is tens ofmillions of years old close to seventy-fivemillion years old at an estimate.”The leading scientist’s eyes flashedwider. Damn the technician. You never toldlaymen things that were likely to scare themoff. You damped it down a bit.But the heedless technician bored on.”It’s also been subject to heavy radiation Ithink, but the count is too faint to tell. Nolonger dangerous. It doesn’t appear to beexplosive but there is some sort of energycharge in there.”The President nodded intellectually.”Well, why not get on with finding what itdoes, or something.”Jedgar scowled at the scientists,scowled at the machine and jutted his jaw atthe President. Jedgar was in no pleasantmood. He had missed Bennie the Dip and30 Gs. This bastard was just a kid playingwith toys.”Mr. President,” said Jedgar in a re-spectful-sounding voice, ”I know of yourinterest in such things and how this is a sci-entific age and so forth, but we ain’t got anyguarantee that that damned thing won’tblow up. The Secret Service would insist”The President waved him off with anindolent hand and turned to the leading sci-entist. ”Go ahead, Doctor. I am truly in-trigued.”The two approached the object, leavingJedgar standing alone in the center of theroom.The two front plates of the machinecontinued to stare blindly. The leading sci-entist poked a finger at the left hand one.”Jenkins says this one is apparently move-able. But there’s no getting into it withdrills. It just breaks the bits.”The President looked curiously at theplate. It had a number of raised dots andmarks and he fingered them. First therewere ten dots in a line, low and to the left.Then a circle about an inch and a half in di-ameter with a radius mark. Then a straightline at the level of the bottom of the circleand about as long as the circle was round.Then two dots at the end of the line but at aheight level with the top of the circle. Afterthat came a wide gap. And to the right ofthe gap were a group of dots arranged sothat as dots they made up small individualgroups of one to nine. Part of this lastgroup was a square that was empty.”Those,” said the leading scientist,”appear to be meaningful, some sort of anequation perhaps.” He coughed depreciat-ingly. ”My assistant Jenkins says whoeverpossibly made this didn’t want barbariansto open it and put a code on it that only anadvanced civilization could resolve.” Al-ways feed the laymen the interesting bitseven when one personally might discountthem. And let assistants take the rap if theywere challenged. ”Isn’t that what you said,Jenkins?”Jenkins had come out of a hole some-where and crept up on the group. He wasshort, poorly formed as a man, looking as ifhe had borrowed his white coat from anelephant. His glasses were three quarters ofan inch thick which made his pupils look"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS5like enlarged specimens. He was very, verynervous. Jenkins seldom got very brave, andtoday, finding himself in company with thePresident and the top cop of the country,he was having a hard time with his nerve.Nevertheless he braved up to it.He spoke all in a rush. ”When wecouldn’t make a dent in it with a sledgehammer, I guessed it might be some culturesuperior to ours. So... ” He bogged down.The leading scientist looked at him incontemptuous tolerance. ”Well, well, comeon.”Jenkins took a deep breath. ”I think...begging your pardon Mr. President andall... I think that’s ”pi”, the radius of a cir-cle.” He yanked a book, a table of loga-rithms out of his enormous jacket pocketand tremblingly opened it to where he hadmade a marker. God help him if he waslooking smarter than his boss. That old bas-tard would put an assistant that looked likecompetition back on an instructor’s post asquick as look at him.The leading scientist said tolerantly,”Well, come on. No matter how silly it maybe, we’re quite receptive.”Appalled at his own bravery, Jenkinsdived all the way in. ”That first row of dotson the left must mean common base tenlogarithms, the circle and line must meanpi – the circle is the same length as theline – I measured them – the two dots theremust mean squared, the gap must meanequals and that group of dots on the rightmust mean one through nine and zero soyou can punch in the answer if you figure itout.”He shakingly found a place in the bookand held it close to his glasses. ”The log of3.14 is 0.4969 and the answer to thatsquared is 0.9938.” He looked up, scaredbut brave. ”The combination to that thing is0.9938 he swallowed. ”If you let me pushthe dots... ”The smile of the leading scientist had acertain amount of hydrochloric acid in it.Never a word in all that about how his bosshad suggested... even if not true. An in-structor’s post in some desegregated schoolwould certainly be in order.”I think,” said the leading scientist,”that I’m at least capable of pushing thebuttons.”Without any great expectations of any-thing happening, he probed an index fingerover the dot groups one by one. A commonbase log squared was not very advancedmath in his opinion, although it is true thatpi was a pretty good idea – communicationwas possible without arbitrary symbols.Now had they put a formula on it in quan-tum mechanics...A flaring green light glared in the otherpanel.The leading scientist and the Presidentjumped back.The green turned into a racing, flashingred that played over their startled faces.A low whine began to ascend. It endedsharply with a loud snap. Jedgar went forhis gun. The left hand plate ceased to flashand turned into a criss cross of white lineslike a speaker grid.In a saw-toothed, metallic voice, theobject spoke. ”Mark 92 Vocotranslator. Allsound and information is now coming toyou by thought concept and visual feedbackso that you hear as though spoken in yourown language.”The group looked at it wide-eyed. Thevoice continued. ”You have activated thepower charge. It will last for two years con-tinuous running and many times that usedintermittently. It will shut off automaticallyat the end of this use. Please step back atleast two paces.”There was an earsplitting whine and acreak and a crash. The whole front face ofthe object below the panels flashed wide"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS6open. It was very hard on their nerves andconfirmed Jedgar’s solid opinion, whichwas usually wrong, that it was a bomb afterall. The gun in his hand shook but hecouldn’t see anything to shoot at except adeep wide cavity which had been disclosedby the opening doors.”Please be seated,” said the object po-litely.The President was suddenly mindful ofhis traditional White House responsibilities.He rose to the crisis. ”Clear the room! Thismay contain confidential information. It cantalk!”This more routine attitude served toclear Jedgar’s scrambled wits. It was an or-der he could understand. He scowled aroundhim. As he was still holding onto his gun,the leading scientist and all others in theroom made haste to comply. By variousdoors they left.Jedgar scurried around the hall andturned keys in locks, looked behind and un-der things with a very practiced eye, usedhis gun muzzle to see if a bug was any-where in the potted palms and, satisfied,found two chairs and brought them back tothe area in front of the object.He seated the President and then, re-versing his own chair and still holding hisgun, sat down. It occurred to him that thedamned thing seemed to know they weren’tready until they were and he glared at it.The President continued to stare intothe black cavity. It was quite wide and quitedark. He nervously hoped no monsterwould spring out of it or that it didn’t turnon a sudden vacuum, suck them in and sendthem spinning off into space.Jedgar looked around the roam one finaltime to see if they were alone. The screen atthe back of the cavity flickered, faltered andthen turned on in full color.CHAPTER ONEThe music was faintly oriental and thedrums were sad.A tattered and ripped up operationsroom showed the signs of battle.The man at the desk was handsome,young, but his face was disfigured with abandage around his forehead. The plainkhaki blouse he wore was singed over theleft shoulder. He looked vital, competent,alive.He was holding a sheaf of papers in hishand, reports, notes, records.”We assume,” he said, ”that as youhave solved this capsule, your civilizationhas advanced to a high standard of technol-ogy – possibly nuclear fission, computers,even space flight – or at least you are capa-ble of these things in your immediate future.”You have a right to know the violenthistory of your planet. Some day whengrass has grown again and the few pitifulsurvivors have multiplied into a culture,you will know what to do with this andunderstand it.”My name is Mish, a Loyal Officer ofthe People of the Galactic Confederation.”He stretched his hand behind him to thewall. There a star map glittered and spar-kled. ”You may never have heard of theGalactic Confederation. It consisted of 21stars and their 76 inhabited planets. Youwere one of those planets.”Earth was a beautiful jewel then. Ithad vast cities, lovely forests and moun-tains and billions of inhabitants.”But all was not calm. Things had hap-pened, not just on Earth but all over theConfederation.”He propped up a screen up on hisdesk. A mob appeared on it, an angry mobcarrying placards, surging and seething out-side a building. Mish continued, ”Throughout the Gal-axy symptoms of unrest, hitherto unknown"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS7in the Confederation were occurring as youcan see by these news clips.”An old woman was being mugged onthe street. She fell. One of the muggerssnatched her purse, the other kicked her inthe face.”Crime was becoming commonplace.”A littered street lined with broken shopwindows appeared.”When there was a power failure in amajor city, thousands of people began afury of looting and burning.”A school yard appeared. A young girlwas being attacked by a mob of thugs.”All these conditions had begun in thepast eight years.”A horde of secret police in grey-greenuniforms and riot dress were shown charg-ing a mob.”The popularity of the government haddropped to an all time low.”A tank was shown attacked by a mob.They turned it over on its side.A government building was shown. Thehuge sign ”Tax Office” was suddenly ob-scured by a blast of flame.”The words ’idealism’ and ’patriotism’had become meaningless throughout the 76planets.”A large array of assorted arms and ex-plosives were being displayed by police, acache discovered in a basement, enough ma-terial to fight a regiment.”Gun running had become a highlyprofitable business.”Trucks loaded with bales of drugs werebeing unloaded by police and tumbled into ahuge bonfire.”Organized crime was profiting asnever before. To combat it hundreds ofthousands of secret police were being re-cruited by the government.”Long ranks of men in grey-green uni-forms were shown drawn up.A colored agitator, speaking from aplatform was shown haranguing a mob. Asecret policeman lined the speaker up in thesights of a blast rifle and fired. The agitatorwas smashed backwards.”But the government in its turn wasusing more and more force in an attempt tocontrol the violence.”A civilian sniper appeared on a parapetof a building. Beyond him a city spread out.The sniper fired down into the street.”And reprisals were earning reprisals intheir turn.”Mish folded the screen. He looked athis notes and then up again.”The Galactic Confederation was veryold. It had endured for thousands and thou-sands of years. It had been happy, pros-perous and peaceful.”The planets were politically democ-ratic. The people elected their own gover-nors and civil officials and the entire Galaxywas governed by the Congress of Loyal Of-ficers of the People. These were trainedmen, skilled in political and martial arts.When they were graduated from their acad-emy they stood for election to the Congressand those chosen loyally served the people.”There was also an executive branchheaded by the Supreme Ruler, a man alsoelected by the people and responsible forthe day to day running of the Confederationbut under the laws and appropriations ofCongress.”Mish laid down his notes.”The Congress of the Loyal Officers ofthe People met every ten years. Matters ofstate, finances and other concerns had beensmooth and routine in the 2053rd Congress.Indeed there had been no upsets at allthroughout the Galaxy.”The Grey Invasion had occurred justbefore that. An invader had attempted adestruction of the Confederation, had sailedin in savage attack and had been effectivelyand efficiently destroyed. He had come"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS8from another Galaxy. But he had found theConfederation prepared and alert and -thatwas the end of him.”The Grey Invasion was shot out ofspace even before full mobilization couldoccur on Earth and our planets and thewhole affair had become ancient history.”The 2053rd Congress had done whatwas necessary to handle all that and it wasfinished. Thus it was with considerableconcern that the Loyal Officers came to the2054th Congress.”Revolt was growing in the Stars.”And it was in this atmosphere that the2054th Congress met to decide what courseto take. On Home Planet, many light yearsaway from Earth, the Loyal Officers of thePeople were arriving from every part of theGalaxy.”CHAPTER TWOThe Announcer on his platform gazedacross the vast spaceport of Home Planet.Behind him a military band in resplendentwhite and blue uniforms blared joyous mu-sic. Before him spread a tumultuous vista ofarriving ships, surging crowds and whippingflags.Two thousand planetary troops withtheir guidons, plumes and drummers linedboth sides of the concourse facing inward,an honor guard.Police cordons blocked tens of thou-sands of people safely away from thelanding ships and the concourse.The harried staff of the Announcer hec-tically tried to catch everything in their ra-dio cameras, tried to spot everyone andwrite down the names of arrivals and dataabout them and pass the result to the An-nouncer.Well aware that his voice was carryingacross this whole vast assemblage throughhuge public address horns, not only acrossand in almost every room of the limitlesscity beyond the field, but also across thestars to seventy-five other planets, the An-nouncer spoke in a rapid, impressivemonologue, kept going by the slips passedto him by his staff.He was apprehensive. Just two daysago these mobs had been surging throughstreets and burning. He had thirty-threestaff here including his cameramen and thiswas a very visible platform, easily rushed.He had half a million credits in equipmentstrewn around here and one firebomb wouldtake it all. He felt responsible as well. Whathe said was going to this crowd and hugeviewscreens around the field as well as eve-ryone else in the Galaxy. The regular an-nouncer for such things had declined todayand he had had to take over even though hewas actually the producer. Soothe them,soothe them. Nervous business.”Hope is a wonderful thing! Lookingacross the field of Home Planet today youwould not think that half the inhabitedworlds of the Galaxy were close to outrightrevolt. Such is the confidence of the peoplein the Congress. There isn’t even a demon-stration placard out there today.” Hereached urgently to his staff for another slipof paper.Ship after ship was landing from a skyfull of ships. As each one swooped down, aLoyal Officer would step out, promptlysurrounded by guards, and stride toward theconcourse.”Ah, what a great day, a great day,”said the Announcer, reaching beseechinglyfor more slips from his staff. ”The mostfamous names of the entire Galactic Con-federation are arriving on this field this af-ternoon. The two thousand and fifty –fourth Congress of the Loyal Officers isbeginning auspiciously.”The high pitched whine of circling"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS9ships, the roar of the crowd and the upsurgeof the band as they began a new piece blot-ted his voice for a moment. He steppedcloser to his dozen cube shaped mikes andhis sound engineer frantically re-adjustedhis levels.”The Loyal Officers, the Loyal Officersof the People, heading 76 planets for the 21star systems of the Confederation, one byone are coming up this concourse... ” Oneof his staff got a piece of paper into hishand and he looked at it urgently and thensmiled happily.”Hah! Here is Rawl!”The group which had entered the fieldend of the Concourse was larger than oth-ers, being joined by military officers inwhite and blue and some civilians. Theywere jostling one another, some of themtrying to reach through and shake handswith the man at the center.Rawl was smiling good-naturedly. Hewas a tall, athletic man, handsome in a bluntsort of way. He wore the plain khaki trou-sers, blouse and cap of a Loyal Officer.The Announcer stood on tiptoe to seebetter over his mikes. ”Rawl, the Loyal Of-ficer in charge of Earth. Rawl, Speaker ofthe Congress! You have heard his nameconnected with every great deed and de-cency!”A surge in the outer crowds became acheer roaring up to blanket the whine ofcircling ships. Rawl was looking up aroundat the familiar faces, smiling, trying to shakeeach hand extended to him. His progress upthe concourse was being slowed by the in-creasing pressure. He drew a long breathand then caught sight of a drummer boy inthe ranks of the Ninth Army honor guardand winked at him. The drummer boygrinned happily and suddenly added to thedin with a bursting roll upon his drum.Just behind Rawl’s group was another.Mish, the center of it, pushed forward,trying to reach Rawl. The Announcer didn’tneed another slip. ”And there is Mish!Mish, Loyal Officer in charge of the OuterLimits, Rawl’s best friend! You know thestory well of how these two stood off theentire fleet of the Grey Invader until ourown battle fleet could arrive. And youknow their daring rescue of the freighterAldebaran... ”Mish finally struggled through the massand tapped Rawl’s shoulder. They grippedeach other’s hand and beamed, their greetinglost in the excited babble of the groups, theswelling roar of the crowd and the bandsuddenly tearing into ”Grey Invader Vic-tory”.The Announcer was staring down at anew sheet of paper jammed into his handurgently. He looked at it, his pleasureevaporating, and followed the stabbing fin-ger of an assistant. Several radio cameraswhirled in that direction.Standing like a naked sword, the blacktower of the spaceport administrationbuilding stabbed at the sky and circlingships.A balcony near its top was draped insomber green. A black wreath with twenty-one stars hung from the railing.”Just now,” said the Announcer in amuch changed tone, ”on the receiving bal-cony of the Administration tower there hasappeared the party of the Supreme Ruler.”The Announcer made sure the radiocameras were centered on the balcony.”There he is, Xenu, the Supreme Ruler ofthe Galactic Confederation.”Xenu, bitter faced, sardonic, leaningheavily on a cane that was more like a club,limped forward to the front edge of thedraped railing. He glared down at the stalledgroup on the concourse below and did notlike what he saw. The dark somberness ofhis civilian suit, the darkness of his hair andface seemed to spread outward. The cheer-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS10ing below dimmed off to silence. The bandfaltered and died down.The Announcer’s voice was overlyloud suddenly for only the whine of shipslay over the field. ”He is accompanied to-day by Chi, the illustrious Minister of Po-lice of the Galactic Confederation.”Chi, jut-jawed, bulldog faced, squat andas crudely built as his civilian suit wasrumpled, was oblivious by any announce-ment. He stepped up to Xenu’s side andlooked belligerently down at the stalledgroups on the concourse.The Announcer was glad to get off thesubject. He frantically waved to his cam-eramen to target the right side of the bal-cony. ”And here is something of interest.He has brought with him today his newmistress, the Lady Min!”Lady Min caught the cue from the PAand stepped forward to the balcony railing.She was a warm and smashingly lovelywoman, splendidly gowned in gold. Theband abruptly struck up a lively theateroverture.”As no one needs to be told, Lady Minis the foremost stage star of the Galaxy!”With perfect poise, Lady Min curtsied.There was a spattering of applause, a fewcheers. She spread her hands to receive theapplause and it increased. She blew a kissand the applause increased again.The Announcer, although he knew shewas unlikely to see him and didn’t evenknow him, blew a kiss back at her in thanksfor getting him out of that one. That crowdsilence had scared him and he had no skill inhandling riots.Putting new forced vitality into hisvoice to swing the crowd’s attention offdangerous ground, the Announcer shouted,”There seems to be a lam of the concourse.No, that’s Rawl!”The radio cameras swiftly whipped tothe concourse. Two cameramen pushedthrough the ranks of the Honor Guard andadded to the press and turmoil, trying to gettheir cameras high enough to shoot downover the milling heads.Rawl and Mish were jammed in tight.A new group had come down from the ad-ministration building adding to the civilians,military officers, press and staff that sur-rounded them already. The group waspushing a big wreath of flowers over peo-ple’s heads and struggling to get closer.”Ah,” said the Announcer, ”Look atthat. The city is trying to give Rawl awreath of welcome and they can’t even getto him.”The wreath, a bit frayed, finally made itby knocking Rawl’s hat askew and bashingdown on his shoulders. Rawl and everyonearound him was laughing but their laughterwas drowned by the rolling roar of cheersfrom the vast crowds when they saw on thescreen boards the wreath had finally madeit. City fathers, their own hats askew in thepress, tried to shout, unheard, their speechof welcome.Up on the balcony, Xenu and Chi be-held the scene.”Well, ” said Xenu bitterly, ”he seemsto have lost none of his popularity.”Chi said, ”Huh!” And it was eloquent.They glared at the sky and concourseas the Announcer’s voice continued to rollover the PA system, to the city, to theplanet, to seventy-five other inhabitedworlds on carrier wave hyperspeed soundand picture.”And still they come, the Loyal Offi-cers of the People! Tomorrow they willmeet in the long awaited two thousand andfifty-fourth Congress in the Galactic Capi-tol. From every quarter”CHAPTER THREERawl let the entrance door swing shut"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS11behind him and gazed across the enormoushall.Seventy-six great flags jutted out onpoles high above, each one with the plaqueof its planet in solid gold below it. The greatarched windows spread a pattern of sun.Hundreds of Loyal Officers were at theirseats already, talking tensely to one an-other. Many caught a glimpse of Rawl andshouted their greetings.At the near end of the room a choirstood in ranks upon a raised balcony andbefore them the Archbishop of HomePlanet stood, his tall, mitred cap flashingwith jewels.Rawl’s eyes went to the rostrum at thedistant end of the hall. On the first tier werethe Ministers of the Executive Branch. Atthe wide desk above it, in a sombre blackrobe, backed by the glittering seal of theConfederation, sat Xenu, Supreme Ruler.For a brief instant over that expanse,their eyes clashed. Then Rawl began towalk down the aisle. The click-click of themagnet-heeled space boots he habituallywore was sharp and punctuating in theroom despite the babble of sound.Chi, on Xenu’s left, was followingRawl’s progress down the long aisle withferret eyes and a palm that itched for con-tact with his hidden blaster.The calm strength of Rawl seemed tospread outward. He was giving little heed tothe greetings beyond a preoccupied nod. Hehad spent the night with committees and, asspeaker of the Congress, he knew what hehad to do.His seat was in the front rank of chairswith empty space between it and the ros-trum. Mish was there already, smiling ea-gerly.Rawl stopped and swept his eyesacross the hall and back at the rostrum.That Chi was a nasty breed. And Xenulooked sardonic, contemptuously amused.Rawl sat down.An officer in the row behind him put afriendly hand on his shoulder. ”Are we go-ing to take up this police state thing rightaway?”Rawl said, ”Might as well.”Mish nodded rapidly. ”Head on colli-sion.”The officer behind them said, ”Goodboy, ” and sat back expectantly.A huge round gong rested in a frame be-side Xenu. He picked up a brass hammerand gave the gong a hard blow. Its long,doleful sound rolled in waves across thehall, carrying audience silence with it.Xenu spoke. ”Now that we seem tohave gotten together somehow – if late – I,Xenu, duly elected Supreme Ruler by theLoyal Officers of the Galactic Confedera-tion, do declare the two thousand and fifty-fourth Congress to be in session.”The choir lifted their voices into ahymn.The hundreds of Loyal Officers rose totheir feet, caps off and stood facing thefront of the room.The Archbishop stood, tall and solemn,bathed in the sound of the choir behind him.As the hymn finished, the Archbishopraised his palms upward. His droning, sono-rous voice spread through the hall:”All blessings to Almighty God and theGalactic Confederation, upon its 21 stars,upon its 76 green planets, upon its trillionsof population and upon the Loyal Officers,loyal to the people, to the Confederationand to God and upon this Congress. Maypeace and prosperity continue as it has forages past.”The Loyal Officers resumed their seats.A crier stepped forward from the endof the rostrum. ”The Congress is now openfor its first deliberations!”Rawl stood. He looked around himcalmly, at the Loyal Officers, the rostrum."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS12”This Congress, ” said Rawl, ”meets inthe shadow of possible planetary revolt.”The last particle of noise vanished from thehall. Every eye gave him full, strained atten-tion.”Head on collision, ” Mish had said.Well here it was.”In the ten years since the last Con-gress, certain orders have been issued by theExecutive Branch which were not ratifiedby the 2053rd Congress.”Xenu went rigid. He had not thoughtthey would dare. ”While we do not wish tobe critical, ” said Rawl, ”and imagine thereare reasons for these orders – no matterhow much mistaken – it has been decidedby the Congressional Committees that ourfirst order of business should be to surveythese changes, put them to a vote, and rat-ify them or not so that their legality or ille-gality is clearly established.”A rapid, electric buzz of approvalspread through the hall.Xenu braced himself, corrected his ex-pression to one of political suavity.”What changes?” said Xenu.Mish instantly produced an ornatefolder and passed it to Rawl who took itwithout glancing at it.”Over the past two hundred years orso, ” said Rawl, ”certain political ideas andinnovations have been put forward fromtime to time. And each time they have beendefeated. But now, beginning eight yearsago, we find they have become executiveorders!”Xenu continued to keep a grip on him-self. He was very sure of his own ground.Rawl glanced at the folder he held.”These ideas are: personal income tax, creditrecords, fingerprinting all citizens, identitycards, passports.”An angry mutter swept through thehall.Rawl dropped the folder. He lifted hishead. ”For thousands of years we have donewithout these things and done well. Yet to-day, by executive order, we find them insti-tuted and enforced on every planet of theGalactic Confederation.Chi bent and whispered urgently intoXenu’s ear.Suavely Xenu smiled. ”These are law-less times. It is the executive responsibilityto keep the realm peaceful, prosperous andcalm.” He tented his fingers and assumed anattitude of stating a fact that everybodyknew and only an idiot would disagree with.”By making it possible to identify everycitizen swiftly we can catch criminals atonce!”In the back of the hall a grey-haired of-ficer leaped to his feet. ”If this identity sys-tem is so successful, then why is it thatduring the last eight years, crime throughoutthis Galaxy has multiplied five times?”Rawl raised his hand in a signal.The doors at the rear of the hall crashedopen and six page-boys, each one pushing awheeled table, raced in and rushed to thefront of the room.The tables, each one piled high withdocuments and reports were rapidly posi-tioned before Rawl.Rawl swept his hand indicating the ta-bles.”The Congressional Committees havenot been idle, ” said Rawl. ”Here, Your Ex-cellency, are the crime records of all sev-enty-six planets for the past ten years. Herealso are the complaints and petitions ofthose planets. Here, as well, are the finan-cial records and appalling rate of inflation ofthe Galaxy.”He let the hall calm down a bit. Helooked mild and persuasive. ”Personal in-come tax and credit records carry with thema total invasion of privacy. Identity cardsand passports put every citizen at themercy of personal enemies as well as the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS13state.”He picked up some of the petitions,long rolls with tens of thousands of namesand, after glancing at them, sought to passthem via a page to Xenu. Xenu flattened hishands against them. He wanted no peti-tions.Rawl continued, even more mild andmore persuasive. ”Such measures are themechanisms that make slaves of a people,that sap their initiative and fill them withfear.”His gaze at Xenu leveled. His voice be-came very firm. ”These are the mechanismsof tyranny and oppression and no right-minded citizen would ever permit them.They are the tools of the sly slave-masterand every one of these measures is a stenchin the nostrils of free men.”An abrupt rolling shout of approvalburst from the hall.He stood very straight. ”The executivebranch is regarding populations as domesticcattle, to be milked for taxes and the pay-ment of loans. You are ear-marking andbranding them with enforced identity cards.You are even teaching them in schools thatthey are animals. You do NOT own them.They are NOT your herd, They are freehuman beings, not economic slaves or gov-ernment property. And any governmentthat violates this fact cannot end in any-thing but destruction of both itself and thepeople. This is NOT opinion! This is his-tory!”Cheers and applause rolled through theCongress.Savagely Xenu cut into it. ”Thesemeasures were vital! He struck the gonghard for order. ”Here, I will call a witness!”He gestured behind him, and to the crier.The crier stood. ”Master Lord Lieuten-ant Zel, chief of the secret police of Earth,appearing as witness for the Ministry ofPolice.”The curtains parted and Zel came forth.He was dressed in a grey-green uniform,glittering with braid. He came to Xenu’sright and stood there, black eyes shifting,his weasel face suspicious.”The only way to handle crime, ” saidZel, ’’is to be able to lay your hands on anycitizen at any time. Men are all basicallycriminal. Without identity cards, withoutthe most detailed dossiers... ””For police blackmail, ” came a shoutfrom the hall.”... the most detailed dossiers, ” con-tinued Zel,”without passports to cut down crimi-nal travel, police work would be utterly im-possible.””You’re causing the revolt!” someoneshouted.Zel struggled on. ”You cannot handle acrime wave unless you consider every citi-zen a potential criminal. And you have tohave fingerprints of everyone to identifymissing persons and bodies... ” Laughterfrom the hall drowned out what he wassaying.He had not been prepared for this muchopposition.He looked sideways at Xenu, looked atthe Congress and then, backward step bybackward step, he got to the curtains andvanished.Xenu was hard eyed. He clamorouslystruck the gong. He gestured urgently to-ward the curtains and the crier.The crier caught his cue. ”Master LordChu, Executive President of the GalacticInterplanetary Bank, presenting testimonyfor the Treasury.”The curtains slipped apart and a fat,pudgy man, very much like a pig, slid for-ward. His civilian clothes were quite plainbut he wore four diamonds in his tie and ahuge diamond on each hand.He was very nervous and was twisting"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS14the rings on his fingers. ”I am very honoredfor the privilege to address the Congress ofLoyal Officers. Doubtless, ” he repressed agiggle, ”this slight misunderstanding can becleared up. You see, ” and he didn’t succeedin repressing the giggle this time, ”You see,the Confederation is not solvent. It has, ” hepaused and looked very pleased, ”very baddebts. Er... ”A Loyal Officer leaped to his feet inthe hall. ”It was completely solvent at thetime of the last Congress!”Chu nodded energetically. ”Well, yes,perhaps it was solvent then. But only onthe surface. The bills for the Grey Invasionwere not all counted up. And the Treasurywas very empty. And so I... I mean theTreasury proposed a personal income tax.Oh, yes, it very much eased things.”Rawl looked at him, calm, assured.”These petitions show that personal incometax has caused wild inflation on everyplanet and has brought about economicstress. The government takes the money ofindividuals and companies before it can beinvested or enter commerce. Wages andprices have had to be doubled, tripled,quadrupled to compensate for this loss ofincome. Inflation and increased public debthas followed.”With a flurry of ring twists and a wrig-gle, Chu said, ”All the very best economistsrecommended it, I am sure. But this is astate matter. I am more concerned with anyeffort to abolish personal credit files andratings. You see, a bank.”Back in the hall, a Loyal Officer was onhis feet. ”As Chairman of the Loyal Offi-cer’s Economic Committee, I wish to re-mind you that banks were perfectly capableof handling their loans and affairs and pros-pered well before this enforced individualcredit file system was instituted. Yourbusiness is with your customers and de-pends on your judgment, not upon somespider web espionage system that pries intothe lives of every citizen’s finances.””Well, ” said Chu, ”well, yes, I dare sayyou have a point... I... er... hasten to as-sure you that banks are not an official partof the government and... er... possiblyhave no right invading privacy.” But he hadhis own point to make and he firmed up andshot it at them. ”But when the governmentneeds money, it always has to come to thebank!” And with this petty triumph hedived back through the curtains.Xenu furiously banged on the gong tostill the laughter.”I suggest, ” said Xenu, ”this Congressget about its proper business. The executiveorders have been passed, they are in effect.They were undertaken under the authorityof the emergency powers granted to the Ex-ecutive in its last session. More police, bet-ter means of identification and more taxmoney are vital to suppress this growingrevolt, these crime waves. This unruly,population must be gotten underCONTROL!” He smashed his clenched fistdown on the desk. He recovered himself abit. He was sure of his ground. He knew hewas right, for one of his virtues was that healways knew he was right no matter whathe did.”They are legal orders. Personal incometax was necessary to replenish the Treas-ury. Identity cards and passports were vitalto check crime. They exist as orders, theyare legal and in force. Under the emergencypowers... ”Rawl smiled tolerantly. ”Not so hur-ried, Your Excellency. The law of the Gal-axy is formed by this Congress. The situa-tion is very plain. This evidence spread be-fore me says very eloquently that inflationand crime have followed those orders.”He turned his back on the rostrum andaddressed the hall. ”The flaw in all thoseenormous personal files being gathered is"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS15that they are obtained by newly active se-cret police. The credit and identity files ofindividuals are stuffed with false reports,lies that are never questioned. When the fileof an individual has been so corrupted, hecan no longer obtain work. He is ruined. Aperson with a false file has no choice but toturn outlaw and criminal. As you wellknow, the criminal ranks, hideouts and lairsare swelling out of control and directly as aresult of these measures. The criminal doesnot have to show an identity card to theperson he robs or kills. Only decent citizensare being regulated.And as to inflation, other wiser meth-ods and economies can be found to handleit.”A mutter of agreement and applausecame from the hall.”The way to handle a possible revolt, ”he continued, ”is NOT more oppression,more police. Revolts start with oppressionand because of repression. The governmentfrantically adds more repression and getsmore revolt. And so it goes on until eitherthe state or the people die. History hasshown that the way to handle threatenedrevolt is to remove utterly, fully and com-pletely all possible reasons for revolt atonce. Laws of government that do not stemfrom the desires and wishes of the peoplecannot be enforced and must not exist.”Rawl took a long breath. It was now ornever. ”I therefore move that the emergencypowers of the executive be cancelled and allexecutive orders be declared null and void.”The shock wave of ayes and cheers hitXenu like a blow. And as the bedlam con-tinued he sank from bitterness into sup-pressed rage.The crowd had been standing for hourson the outside steps of the Congress hall,waiting, waiting.Suddenly the big PA horns blared. ”Themotion has passed!”For an instant the crowd was still.Then they exploded into a deafening roar ofcheers. Some leaped in the air, othersdanced. An old lady just continued to stareat the PA horns and then sank down againstthe wall and began to cry tears of relief forit meant her two grandsons, imprisoned fornot paying accurate tax, would be freed.The waves of cheering and dancing feetchurned about her.The factory cafeteria, where workershad been eating their evening meal, wassuddenly struck to silence by the PA.The lunchroom exploded into a frenzyof cheering. Plates, food and all, sailed intothe air.They jumped on tables and began todance and shout.A foreman raced up the curving stairsto the time keeper room and jabbed frantic-ally at ”whistle”, ”siren” and ”fire alarm”buttons and out of the top of the factory,joined promptly by other towers in the in-dustrial zone, came a shattering blast ofjoyous sound.A priest as wide as he was tall racedinto the bell loft of the great cathedral andbegan to yank on every bell rope he couldreach.The street had been impassablyjammed with cars and people, waiting,waiting, all eyes riveted upon the huge viewscreens and PA horns.The blared ”Motion has been passed”was like hitting a button for total commo-tion.The people screamed with delight.Every driver hit his car horn.Whatever else the PA might have saidwas totally inaudible in the din.Three young men immediately reachedinto the back seat of their bus and ripped ablanket off a concealed, mounted automaticblast weapon and stripped the charge boltsout of it. Grinning at one another they"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS16dumped the weapon into a street garbagecan, abandoning it. They stood and addedtheir voices to the din.The newscaster in the Home Planet In-terplanetary Broadcast Corporation towerheld the first slip in his excitedly shakinghands and screamed at the operator, ”Con-nect it up! Connect it up!”The technician was urgently unsnarlingcables that re-snarled in his haste and jam-ming plugs into the connector for eachplanet. He got the board green lighted andsnapped a mike cable into the master aftertwo misses.The newscaster gripped the cubiclemike, started to talk, realized his signal wasnot green, hit the mike, got it green andyelled, ”Alert, alert! All planetary news-rooms. Official, official! Galaxy wide. The2054th Congress of Loyal Officers just can-celled the executive orders of personal in-come tax, identity cards and passports. De-tails to you as fast as they come in here!”A door opened behind him. The distantshouts, horns, sirens of the city were heardfor an instant.The newscaster whirled. One of his re-porters had just come in.A huge fan of celebration fireworks ex-ploded over the city and flashed through thecontrol tower windows.The newscaster stripped the paperfrom the reporter’s hand. ”Quick! Get Molat the palace... we want details... color...background... interviews... ” The reporterdived at a communication panel. ”The pal-ace the palace Mol. Get me Mol.”CHAPTER FOURLady Min was close to being smashedup flat in the palace hallway.Half a hundred newsmen and camera-men clamored before her, pounding her withquestions.Beside her, Ap, her press agent, aflashily dressed young man, tried withoutmuch success to keep her from beingknocked off her feet.”Lady Min, ” shouted a reporter, ”asthe Supreme Ruler’s mistress, would yousay Xenu was pleased?”Ap tried to field the question. ”LadyMin is the greatest actress in the Galaxy.She does not meddle in politics. Gentlemen,would you please... ”Another newsman shouted, ”Is it trueRawl accused Xenu of trying to stir theplanets to revolt?”And another, ”Lady Min, would yousay the women will be pleased... ”And yet another, ”Did Xenu say hewas planning a vacation on the summer sat-ellite?”Lady Min had edged backward andbackward, trying to keep herself all in onepiece. Her red evening gown was pulledaskew on one shoulder. Her red, spar-klestudded shoes had been stepped on. Thejeweled flower in her hair had been pulledback of one ear.The din was hard on her ears. ”Ap, ”she shouted, ”stars and spotlights, handlethem!”Ap groaned. ”In ten years I never hadto handle a wild animal act.” Suddenly hesaw that she had her back to an executiveoffice door and her hand was already turn-ing the latch to open it behind her. ”Whereare you going?”Lady Min slid through the door and be-fore any pressure could be put on it, bangedit shut. Ap promptly stepped in front of itand held up one hand while he fished in hisbig-checked jacket for a sheaf of releases. Afanfare of hands began to grab at them.Lady Min sagged back against the door.From the other side still came the mutter ofthe commotion in the hall. She was limp."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS17What had she gotten herself into? Thecommands of the Supreme Ruler in the pastfew years had become absolute. Threeweeks ago he had simply sent an order tothe theater that she was appointed his mis-tress. And why? He hated women, appar-ently couldn’t stand to touch one. Had shesaid ”No” there was no telling what wouldhappen to her. The government lately had away of ruining anyone who said ”No.” So,even though Ap beat his brains trying tofind a way around it, here she was.She looked about her. This was one ofXenu’s executive offices. It was splendidlyornate in red velvet and gold. It had a bar, ablack table in the room center with somesort of a computer panel in its top and acouch that faced the windows, its back tothe room. It was the couch that caught herweary eye and she moved toward it.One of her glittering red leather shoescame off, its strap broken in the ”inter-views” but she let it lie and limped onacross the room. Exhausted she droppeddown on the couch. The back blocked herview of the room, the wide windows gazedout on the eveningcity. She started to light a cigarette andthen let it fall back in the tray. She put afinger under the gold band at her throat andloosened it. Her eyes lingered on a braceletthat bore the enameled picture of the Su-preme Ruler and then tore it off her wristand dropped it on the floor. She stared atthe ceiling and let out a long sigh.What had she gotten herself into? In hermany years on the stage, beginning whenshe was five, she had been in some commo-tions, some remarkable ones, but seldomanything even approaching this. The playhad closed, mainly because she had had toleave the cast but partly because of publicdisturbance. The broadcast series she wasgoing to do had been suspended due to herbeing ordered to the palace. And Xenu had,in the underworld if not amongst the popu-lation, a very unsavory reputation, vague,whispered about, never specified. Whatcrazy bent had caused him to suddenly or-der someone to become his mistress? Ah,well, tomorrow would tell. Evening wasgradually turning into night. She turned onher side and stared out at the stars, dimmedby the celebrations and lights of the city, farfrom guessing that there lay her immediatedestiny.The latch of the door to Xenu’s quar-ters rattled and the door swung open. Muchin the way one would shoo a chicken, Xenupushed Chu before him.Xenu shoved the door shut with hiscane and snapped on the lights by jabbing itat the switch. He looked at the bar, the ta-ble, the hall door. The back of the couchwas toward him. Satisfied, he limped to thetable and lowered himself into the chair be-fore the computer.Chu was in an uproar. He was twistingso hard at his rings that he appeared to betaking his fingers off.”It’s ruin!” said Chu. ”It’s ruin, I tellyou. Ruin. Without personal credit files oridentity papers, we will never be able tolocate debtors and persuade them intopaying.”Xenu showed no slightest sympathy.”Crush them into paying, blackmail theminto paying, you mean.”Chu agitatedly gestured at a chair forpermission to sit and then wriggled into it.”You promised... ””I promise nothing, ” said Xenusharply. Then he relaxed. ”I brought youhere, my piggy, little friend, to give orders,not to make promises.”With a sly lift of his eyebrows, Chusaid, ”Remember it was my ideas and sug-gestions that got all the money into theTreasury.””Yes, and now it will have to be paid"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS18back. And exactly how we make up the lit-tle commissions that were spread aroundamongst us is a problem. And don’t forgetthat it was your idea because it was a badone.”Chu began to sweat a bit in alarm. Onecould never tell about Xenu.But Xenu was not there to engage inidle conversation. ”We have business to do.The Congress has put over me and thewhole executive branch a guard committeeon finance. Without their authorization thegovernment cannot spend a single credit.This was their method of paralyzing anysecret action I might take. They could notremove me as every action I took was com-pletely legal under the emergency powers.But there is an election next year.”Chu flinched.”Precisely. We will all be retired to thescrapheap. And don’t think that becauseyou are a banker you will be overlooked. Itis not beyond possibility that under a newSupreme Ruler, they will look into some ofyour loans and connections. They mighteven discover how you use billions of pub-lic funds to improve the surroundings ofyour private holdings. They might even findhow much public money you had us spendto completely rehabilitate asteroids so that,you could put resort hotels on them andpocket... ””No, no, ” said Chu nervously. ”Youdon’t have to push me into despair with it.My doctor... ””Good, ” said Xenu. ”Then we under-stand one another.”He promptly began to punch buttonson the table computer and view screen. Itflared green and the green light, shining up-ward, glowed on their faces.Xenu muttered as he pushed buttons.”About two billion for renegades... anotherfour billion to secretly rehire the secret po-lice.”Apprehension began to mount in Chuas he watched the dancing figures.”The minimum amount, ” said Xenu,looking at Chu, ”is one trillion Galacticcredits.”Shock made Chu twist a ring so deeplyit cut him.”In private funds, ” said Xenu. ”Un-traceable.”Chu did not speak. He was incapable ofit for the moment.With a long, expert finger, Xenu beganto punch buttons again and the figures againstarted to race across the computer, in-creasing the amount.”No, ” said Chu. ”No, no, no. ” Hegathered his wits and gradually took on asly, calculating attitude. ”And my creditsystems?””You’ll get them back, ” said Xenu.”And the use of public treasury to im-prove my private holdings?””Of course, ” said Xenu.With well being slowly seeping throughhim, Chu said, ”A trillion Galactic credits.Untraceable funds and accounts.” He got upand minced to the door. He looked back atXenu and, humming to himself, opened thedoor.Chi came through it. A very gloomy,listless Chi. He closed the door after Chuand wandered over to the middle of theroom.Xenu pried himself erect with his caneand limped to the bar. He was smiling, morecheerful than he had been for days. He tookdown a bottle and began to prepare drinks.Chi gloomily followed him to the bar.He let out a deep sigh, ”We are crashed.”Xenu uttered a short vicious laugh andcontinued to pour drinks. ”Not so, myfriend. The game has not ended. It has onlynow begun!”The handkerchief Chi was using to mophis face halted at the side of his jutting jaw."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS19He was not quite bright enough to take thisin. He looked stunned.”But it’s only a matter of time untilthey depose you. Certainly within the year!And my files. They’ve ordered me to de-stroy my files and erase my computers!”Xenu pushed a drink toward him andspoke casually. ”There are other files youcan destroy and plenty of useless comput-ers you can erase. Chi, did it ever occur toyou that you now have a file on everycriminal, renegade and psychopath in thisentire galaxy?” He sipped his drink lov-ingly. ”And have you ever thought at onetime or another what a splendid secret forcethey would make?”Uncertainly Chi took hold of the drink.The concept finally got through to him, heraised his eyebrows and started to lift theglass in a toast but a horrible thought oc-curred to him.”But this will take money. And all fi-nances are cut off. Have you ever asked arenegade how much he... ””Indeed I have, ” said Xenu. ”But notarget. We will have more than adequatefunds, private, secret.”The illustrious Minister of Policestirred it around in his mind and then beganto get the idea.Xenu put down his glass, all business.”And so we reoccupy the bases destroyedand abandoned after the Grey Invasion. Werecruit every renegade we can lay our handson, we train and equip and on one certainday a few months hence we will... ”Chi hastily got out a pad and pencil andeagerly started to write these orders down.Xenu knocked the pad up. He began tomove back to the black table leaving hisdrink behind him.”No, no notes. This is totally secret.You will even have to develop your owncodes and transmissions. You can trust onlythose on whom you have definite black-mail.” He sat down in his chair. ”This willtake very careful planning. A simultaneousstrike coordinated on all planets... ”Under Xenu’s finger the green com-puter face lighted up. ”There will be noLoyal Officers left to object. And especiallyno Galactic Commander Rawl, especially noRawl.’’ This pleased him and he stabbedthe buttons viciously. ”They wanted a re-volt! We’ll give them a revolt. Did youknow, Chi, that all revolts start from thetop. It’s an historical fact... ”Chi grabbed his arm. Xenu looked up insome annoyance and then followed the lineof Chi’s glare.On the floor midway between thecouch and the sofa lay a glittering red shoe.Chi’s hand darted to the hidden blasterunder his coat.Xenu restrained him and silently beganto rise from his chair. He walked cat-footedly over to the back of the couch.He looked down on Lady Min. Hereyes were closed as though asleep, but herbreast was heaving a bit rapidly.He reached down and suddenly grabbedher hair. With a savage wrench he yankedher to her feet.She backed up toward the window.”I’ve been asleep!”He curled his lip. ”And by that youconfess you heard every word!”She got her hair loose and tried to run.She stumbled and crumpled into a heap.Xenu leaped after her. He yanked her to herfeet.”And I suppose your first thought is tocontact Rawl! You corrupted bitch! Youfilthy whore!”He shook her violently. ”This is what Iget for taking you in.” His voice rose to ascream. ”You were supposed to bring mepopularity!”Terror was giving away to anger inLady Min. She gave him a level look,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS20”Popularity is earned, not bought!”The cane came up and struck her.She went sprawling into the cornerback of the hallway door, knocked out.The blaster was in Chi’s hand, he madea gesture to Xenu to get him out of his lineof fire. ”Please move a bit your excellencyso I can get a clear shot.”Xenu took his eyes off the crumpledfigure. Slowly, he was gathering his wits,taking a competent estimate of the situa-tion. ”No. Mo, we don’t want anotherscandal. The pigs of this galaxy have beenfed enough.”He hobbled over to the table motioningto Chi to put away his gun. ”Call DoctorStug.””Robotize her,” said Chi.Xenu nodded several times. ”Deper-sonalize her with neurosurgery.” Thethought pleased him. ”Drag her to her room,put her under guard.” He laughed. ”Shemight even be some fun.”CHAPTER FIVELady Min’s bedroom was a very ornateaffair. It looked out across the sprawlingnight-lit city. Mirrors that could be adjustedto different angles reached from ceiling tofloor all about the walls. One mirrored doorled into the hallway, another into a largebathroom. A huge boudoir table, ornatewith gold frames stood beside the bed. Afull communications panel and screen glit-tered in the wall.Lady Min lay sprawled upon the bedwhere they had thrown her.She started to rise and winced. She feltgingerly at her head where the cane hadstruck her. Panic was rising in her but shesteadied it down. This was no time to go topieces. She had no illusions whatsoeverabout the trouble she was in or her possiblefate. The rumors in the underworld aboutXenu could not be without foundation.Unsteadily she removed her ruinedgown and walked over to the wash basin atthe boudoir table. She took a wet towel andbegan to sponge the bruised area above herear.The sharp knock at the door was fol-lowed at once by a key grinding harshly inthe lock.Doctor Stug opened the door.In the hall behind him a nurse, a wheel-table and a guard were waiting.Stug closed the door and advanced intothe room. He was a tall man dressed inblack civilian clothes. His pointed beard andribboned eye glasses gave him a veneer ofprofessionalism. As Xenu’s private psy-chiatrist he had had a great deal of practicein deception. His left hand was held behindhis back.”I just came to see if you were all right,” said Doctor Stug.Lady Min laid down the towel andlooked alertly at him.The tilted mirror beside the door clearlyshowed his back.It disclosed as well the narcotic pistolhe was hiding, a pistol good for a hundredshots anything-up to ten feet which guaran-teed a day or more of unconsciousness.”These petty lover’s quarrels!’’ saidDoctor Stug. ”Tch. Tch. I have knownXenu for a long, long time and he may getangry but he quickly forgives, quickly for-gives. I wouldn’t doubt that it will be allmade up by bed time.”He began to move forward slowly, eas-ily.”Why, you seem to have a bruise onyour cheek. Well, well, we can do some-thing about that at least.”Lady Min looked at him and thenpointed to her cheek. She winced and beganto walk toward him unsteadily. ”It is a bit"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS21swollen, but really I feel very faint.”She came close to him presenting hercheek. ”Can you see if anything is broken?”She stumbled and her left hand flew upas to balance herself.Instinctively Stug reached for her withhis free hand.Lady Min’s right lashed around to hisback.She jerked the hidden gun outward sothat it pointed at his side.Her thumb depressed his finger on thetrigger.A tiny white puff hammered throughthe cloth of his coat.Stug’s eyes flew wide, dazed. Hismouth opened and he slowly slumped for-ward. His head hit the rug.Lady Min knelt over him and disen-gaged the narcotic pistol. She fumbled withthe slide and then got it cocked again.Softly she said, ”You’re not so differ-ent from any stagedoor jackass, DoctorStug.”She checked the slide, pulled his coatcollar open and pressed the muzzle againsthis bare neck.”Have a good day’s sleep, brain sur-geon.” The muzzle jumped and a puff ofwhite smoke eddied up from it.She tossed an apprehensive look at thedoor. She knew there were guards there, notonly the one who would come with DoctorStug, but also door guards. Xenu would notneglect that.She sped to her closet and yanked out alarge flowing night robe. She threw it overStug and quickly adjusted it to cover all ofhim and his shoes.Moving fast, she went to the communi-cations console. She knelt before it andhastily pushed buttons. It’s screen blurredand flashed. Urgency and some panic wascatching up with her.A long way away in the city Ap wasflopped over a bar in a honky-tonk, grip-ping a drink, listening languidly to a girlwho sang soothingly in front of the band. Aragged buzz came from his pocket and witha bored sigh he took out a flat small com-munications unit with a tiny view screen.His calm vanished when he saw a dishev-eled Lady Min appear on it.Her voice was sharp and tinny throughthe tiny receiver. ”Ap! Where is Rawl?”Ap blinked and got his mind into focus.”What a spectacular question. He left forplanet Earth about sunset. The congress isover, you... ””You’ve got to contact him!”Ap’s hand on the receiver began toshake. ”We got banner headline trouble, Ican tell! He’ll take days in flight. That’sout. Look... ””Ap. Get out to the spaceport fast andget my spaceyacht ready for instant take-off. Quick, quick!”The honky-tonk music increased involume. ”But Lady Min, they just changedyour pilot... ”There was a sharp click as the commu-nications receiver went off.Ap steadied himself against the bar.”Hot smoke, she rang off. Well here goestomorrow’s headlines maybe.” He let out ashivering sigh, ”Future Zero!” He jammedhis communicator into his pocket. It seemedto him that the music was actually a shriek.He collected himself, threw a one creditnote on the bar and tottered out toward thedoor.In the bedroom Lady Min rose fromthe console. She stared at Stug on the floorand quieted her rapid breathing.She rushed to the bathroom and turnedon its light. She opened a faucet until thewater roared.She left the bathroom door a crack openand made sure lights could be seen from theroom."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS22Narcotic pistol in hand, she sped overbeside the main entrance door, positioningherself so that when it opened she would bebehind it.She was breathing rapidly and carefullysteadied herself down. She pulled back theslide on the narcotic gun and hefted it. Shetook a deep breath. Slowly she unlatchedthe door and let it drift open a couple ofinches.She raised her chin and in a not toogood imitation of Stug’s voice called,”Nurse!”With a clatter and a bang the door wasshoved open from the outside by thewheeled stretcher, pushed by the nurse andflanked by the guard. They saw the coveredbody on the floor and pushed the stretcheron into the room.The guard, dressed in the grey-green ofthe secret police, gripped his blast rifle atready and looked about.The nurse’s head was covered with awhite scarf, her shirt was blue-striped andwhite-cuffed and she wore a voluminouswhite skirt. She looked at the body on thefloor and then at the partly opened bath-room door, noted the running water andsmirked. ”Have some fun for yourself first,Doc?” she said.With her palm Lady Min swung thehall door shut.At the sound of the latch the nursestarted to turn.With one step forward Lady Minpressed the muzzle of the narcotic gunagainst her neck and fired.The secret police guard whirled andstarted to raise his blast rifle to firing posi-tion. He opened his mouth to shout.Lady Min worked the slide of the pis-tol and jammed the narcotic gun in the direc-tion of his open mouth.She pulled the trigger and a white puffof smoke eddied around his suddenly slackjaws as he crumpled.She grabbed the blast rifle to keep itfrom clattering on the floor and eased it tothe carpet.She silently slid home the bolt on thebedroom door. She sagged against the wall,gasping with relief. ”Stars and spot lights!”she breathed.She realized she wasn’t out of thereyet, and it would only be a matter of min-utes before the guards outside the doorwould begin to wonder what was going on.She went to the peephole port in thedoor, uncovered it and looked at its lens.There were two guards in the hall. Onewas standing indolently beside the door.The other was sitting in a chair across thehall, his blast rifle held between his kneeswhile he fished in his pockets for a lighter,an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips. Therest of the hall was empty.Lady Min closed the view port. Shetook the guard by the shoulders and withconsiderable effort dragged him into thebathroom. She went back and knelt besidesthe nurse. Laying the narcotic gun on thefloor she urgently began to strip the nurseof her clothes, first the scarf then the skirt,then the shoes and finally the blouse. DearGod it was lucky the nurse was a trifle big-ger than she was.Working fast and frantically she shortlyhad the now naked nurse dumped in thebath tub, Stug – with exertion that was al-most too much for her – laid out on thestretcher and the blast rifle under him. DearGod it was also lucky that he wasn’t toobig a man. She pulled the cover sheet overhis form obscuring him utterly. She climbedinto the nurse’s clothes and then with twodarting trips to look at the nurse’s face sheconverted her own nose, mouth and hair lineto a similarity.She adjusted the nurse’s scarf andlooked at herself in the mirror. She in-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS23spected herself carefully and then nodded.She opened a drawer in the boudoir andgrabbed a handful of rings and her walletand stuffed them inside her shirt bosom.She picked up the narcotic pistol andwent into the bathroom. Working the sliderapidly she pumped an additional shot intothe guard and another into the nurse.She came back to the stretcher, picked anightgown off the floor and threw it care-lessly across the stretcher’s foot.She looked around the room, closed thebathroom door, locked it and sailed the keyunder the bed. Silently she unbolted themain entrance door.She took one final look around theroom, drew a long breath to steady herselfand then with one hand on the bottom railof the wheelstretcher she swung the dooropen.With a hard yank she sent the stretchersailing out into the hall, stepped after it andslammed the door. The guards stiffened.The one nearest it, looked at the closeddoor and then at Lady Min. ”Where’s theother two?”Lady Min looked at him sneeringly.She had heard the nurse speak and hopedher voice now sounded like it. ”The funthey had made a little mess. They’re clean-ing it up so old Xenu won’t notice. Phagh,Doctors! ”The guards leered and looked at thedoor.Lady Min jabbed her finger authorita-tively at one of the guards. ”Call an ambu-lance to the south door.” She glared authori-tatively at the other one. ”Give me a handwith this stretcher.”CHAPTER SIXStanding beside the spaceyacht, his earsassailed with the whine of ships and rattlingclatter of the hangar, Ap was gradually los-ing seven years of his growth. The sweatran damply down one side of his foreheadand he dabbed it off with a gaudy handker-chief.The spaceyacht designing was blackwith a white diagonal stripe and while itmight have very nice appointments, it left alot to be desired for long voyages. And justnow it was only about an eighth full of fuel.Ap stared out across the expanse ofspace port toward the administration tower.He didn’t know what he was watching orwaiting for and he expected the area toerupt with guards any instant.The pilot was lounging under the stubwing of the craft, one foot indolently restingon the sloped landing ramp which extendedfrom the side of the fuselage. He was a newpilot. He had Just been assigned. Some ofhis time in the last twenty-four hours hadbeen spent in wondering what happened tothe man he replaced, what he had done tothrow him out of favor.”You say she’s only going to the Sum-mer Palace satellite, ” said the pilot. ”That’sno great flight.Why do you want to top up all the fueltanks and air?”Ap carefully put on his most persua-sive manner. ”Well it’s safest to have fullfuel tanks. Go ahead. Fill her.””Why!””They may want to take a grand tour,sightseeing amongst the satellites. Look,you’re just new here. When you serve atthis stellar level of command chain, take itfrom Ap, be prepared for anything.”Doubtfully the pilot moved over to thehead of the ship and waved a lazy hand at apassing fuel and air truck.Ap went on staring toward the admini-stration building.Chi prowled along the palace hall. Onehad to keep one’s eye on everything thesedays. You couldn’t trust anybody to do"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS24anything. Also they didn’t keep him in-formed the way they should. Only a fewminutes ago he had heard that Lady Minhad been taken away by ambulance, whichwas peculiar as there was a complete oper-ating room right here in the palace speciallyinstalled by Xenu for exactly such emergen-cies. He looked at the guard outside LadyMin’s door. ”Why are you still on guardhere? Haven’t they gone?”The guard started and straightened upstiffly. It made one nervous just to see Chimuch less to be talked to by him. ”YuhYuh. They took her out. But the brain-banger and one of my guys are still inthere – straightening up.”Chi didn’t like it. He stood for a mo-ment and then suspiciously slid the dooropen.There was nobody in there. He in-stantly drew his gun and stepped sidewisethrough the door.Cat-footed he approached the bath-room door, flipped the knob, found itlocked. He stepped back and crashed theflat of his foot against the door just besidethe knob.It flew open.The guard lay sprawled on the floor.The nurse lay naked in the tub.The guard stood jaw open looking inand then something like terror came into hiseyes as he shifted them to Chi. He had avery good idea what would happen to himnow.Chi thrust the guard violently aside andrushed out into the hall shouting.Ap heard the siren before he saw theambulance and for a sweating instant wascertain that it must be a police car.The white vehicle shot across the field,dived into the hangar and, siren dying, spunabout and pointed its nose toward the han-gar door. With a squeal it backed to theramp.On the run the driver and attendantraced back to the rear ambulance doors andflung them open.Ap was hastily trying to put the piecesof this together. He saw a nurse step outand if she hadn’t moved her hand towardhim briefly, only in a way Lady Min woulddo, he wouldn’t have known who it was.The driver and attendant rolled thestretcher toward the bottom of the rampand would have rolled it straight on up intothe ship had it not been for the pilot barringthe way.The pilot frowned. ”What the rocketsis this?” He came on down the ramp to thebottom and reached for the cover at the topof the stretcher.Lady Min chopped at his hand. ”Whydon’t you call Xenu and find out?”He frowned and again reached for thecorner of the sheet.This time Lady Min used the side edgeof her hand on his wrist.”I know all about little boys who can’tkeep their hands off unconscious girls. Youpervert.”Ap had it now. He rushed forward.”Come on, come on. There’s little time tolose.”And he gave the stretcher a perilouspush up the ramp. If he hadn’t jumpedaside the pilot would have been knockeddown. The driver and attendant pushedwith a will and with a roar of wheels thestretcher flew on up the ramp and into thefuselage of the spaceyacht. Sullenly the pi-lot followed it.Ap came to the spaceyacht door as thedriver and attendant trotted back down theramp. ”Thank you fellows, ” Ap called afterthem. ”Greatest drive in history prettynear. Xenu won’t forget this!”The ambulance men waved back to him,climbed into their vehicle and shot off.The pilot pulled the ramp closed and"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS25walked doubtfully to the pilot seat.His eyes wide with unanswered ques-tions, Ap looked at Lady Min. She shookher head at him and pushed the stretcherdown the aisle of the ship toward a cabin atthe tail.Languidly the pilot was obtaining hisclearance from the tower. He checked overthe instrument panel and began to start themotors.”Take off!” yelled Ap. ”Get this thingspaceborne!” The ship lurched and began toroll forward slowly.Lady Min got the stretcher fully insidethe rear cabin and began to lash it to cleatsin the wall. Ap banged the cabin door shutand lifted the sheet at the head of thestretcher.He gulped.”Stug!” He stared at Lady Min. ”Whyhim? This is Stug, Xenu’s chief brain-banger.””Can this rust can get to Earth?””Earth! That’s days away. No.”They were pushed back heavily as theship leaped into take-off.Chi flung himself out of the car andraced up the steps of the control tower,glancing sideways at the sky as he went.The open air defense platform at thetop of the tower was manned by blue andwhite uniformed soldiers, idling about.They were planetary troops and not in totalagreement with keeping a constant alertsince nothing had happened for a decadesince the Grey Invasion. It seemed a wasteof time, Their officer sat, bored, on theparapet. The snouts of four heavy caliberanti-spacecraft guns pointed motionless atthe zenith.Chi burst upon the platform, lookedaround for the officer and rushed at him,pointing at the sky.”I am Chi, Minister of Police. Thatship, that one there. A bank has just beenrobbed and they are escaping on that ship.By police orders fire on it!” The officerlooked through his viewer and then back atChi. ”But that’s Lady Min’s spaceyacht!””I know, I know, ” screamed Chi.”She’ll be furious. Start shooting. Startshooting before they get out of range!””Bank robbers?” The officer made uphis mind and gestured at his sergeant, ”Stopthat ship!”The four muzzles of the battery sweptdown into firing position, long streaks ofred flame sped from them in a staccato roar.Inside the ship Ap struggled forwardup the aisle against the heavy acceleration.He tapped the pilot on the shoulder.”If you’ll just set a course... ” Hegaped as ribbons of flame shot by in frontof the wind screen.The pilot whipped his head around tothe side window and looked back at therapidly receding field. The red boom of gunfire flashed in his eyes. His face went grey.Without a second thought, the pilotturned back to the control panel. His glancecentered on ”Pilot Eject”. His hand stabbedhysterically at it.The pilot seat and the panel beside ittilted violently over.The white smoke of the ejection explo-sion puffed around the pilot.In a long graceful arch the pilot sailedout into the atmosphere and began to tum-ble.Ap screamed, ”Come back here!”The hurricane wind of the ship’s pas-sage was whipping into the cabin from theopen ejection port. He reached and hur-riedly snapped the panel shut.Down below he could see the pilot’sparachute opening.Flame shots raced by between theparachute and the ship.Ap stared at the maze of controls, thekeyboards of buttons on the flashing spin-"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS26ning navigation console. He threw up hishands in despair.More shots flashed by the windscreen.Lady Min was trying to inch forwardfrom the tail. Her handkerchief and glasseswere off and her hair was flying wildly.Five flame shots zipped through theside of the ship directly in front of LadyMin. She flinched.”I can’t fly this thing!” wailed Ap.”Neither can I!” shouted Lady Min.He ripped open a drawer under the pi-lot’s seat and scrambled in it. He broughtout a manual ”Mark 38 Navigation Con-sole!” He shakingly yanked at its pages oneby one.A flame projectile went through thewindscreen another hit the tail and the shipbegan to shake.Trying to get the diagram to match upwith the buttons, Ap hit ”Accelerate’’ Hehuntingly hovered over other buttons.He clenched his fist in indecision anddespair.”Future Zero!”Abruptly he jabbed five buttons chosenat random all at once.The ship abruptly changed course andvaulted skyward in a spinning spiral.A final barrage of shots sped by underthe ship converging on where it would havebeen.Lady Min held on desperately in theaisle. Loose objects thudded and bangedabout the ship.The passing hurricane velocity air madethe small holes in the fuselage whistle andscream like maniacs.Lady Min looked at the holes. She re-alized that when they hit space they wouldlose all their air.She braced herself and pried open alocker. She brought out a roll of tape anddragged herself to the side of the ship.Stripping off chunks of the adhesive withher teeth she began to patch the holes.The ship, steadied out, continued itsvertical headlong course for who knowswhere.CHAPTER SEVENThe ship rocked gently as its auto-pilotcorrected against gravitic pulls. The aislebetween the two couches was littered withempty food cans which clinked together asthe ship moved. Crumpled wads of notepaper littered the floor between the twocouches.Ap took one last look at the navigationmanual and resumed staring at the ceiling,dropping the manual into the litter of thefloor.”Guy that wrote that navigation manualought to get top billing as an idiot... ”Lady Min stirred on the oppositecouch. She still wore the nurse’s uniformbut now it was rumpled and dirty. She tookher eyes off the overhead and looked list-lessly at Ap.”No idea where we are?””Not being pulled into a flaming sunanyway – maybe.””These weeks of this have been... ” Shewas interrupted by a sudden tilt of the ship.Ap sat up, startled. He stared throughthe window.Covering a large portion of the sky be-side the ship was a huge-black asteroid, itsoutline visible only because of the MilkyWay beyond it; A patrol ship flashed by,close to.The spaceyacht console speakerflashed red and from it came a loud officialbass voice.”Patrol A from Interceptor Base 62.Shut off your motors. You will be landedby remote control tractor beams. Anyonefound armed on landing will be guilty of afelony. Do not jettison any cargo.”"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS27Lady Min sat up, ecstatic. ”InterceptorBases are commanded by Loyal Officers!We’re saved! We can reach Rawl!”The spaceyacht was slowly and inexo-rably pulled toward the satellite where largehangar doors were sliding open.Two pilots in the hangar watched itsapproach. One of them took a closer look atit and then slid his blast pistol into its hol-ster and buckled the flap, dismissing thesituation. ”Ah it’s just some foolspaceyacht that lost its way.”The other dropped his chin on hisspeaker button inside his space helmet.”Dull, dull, dull. No excitement at all sincethe Congress. Crime doesn’t pay anymore.”They turned and sauntered through theairlock door and shut it behind them.The spaceyacht came to rest on thehangar floor. The big red lights which said”No air” began to flash. The hangar doorsground down and sealed themselves with agrating clank. The hangar warning light wentgreen and flashed, ”Safe atmosphere”; Thelanding ramp from the yacht fell into posi-tion with a crash.A cleaning man and cleaning woman,old and not much surprised at anything,gathered their mops and buckets togetherand shuffled toward the ramp.An officer in blue and white-fatigueuniform lounged up against the craft.Lady Min and Ap, highly excited andurgent scrambled out of the ship and randown the ramp. The Officer smiled toler-antly, thumbs hooked in his belt, cap on theback of his head. He negligently waved hishand to indicate the direction they shouldtake and, leading off, escorted Ap and LadyMin into the now open airlock which leddeeper into Asteroid Interceptor Base 62.The cleaning couple watched them goand then shuffled up the ramp with theirmops and bucket.They paused at the port and gazed atthe littered wreck.”Well, well, looks like they had quite aparty, ” said the old woman She chuckled toherself.The cleaning man walked through thelitter, kicking at it and approached the cabindoors at the rear of the ship. He tried toopen a door and found it locked.He sighed, reached to the key ring in hisbelt, laboriously sorted out a master keyand finally got it unlocked.Just as he was about to touch the knobit was twisted from within.The door was yanked inward.Doctor Stug, disheveled, savage, hisprofessional calm left far behind him,loomed in the doorway. He glared around.When he saw the cleaning man and womanwere the only occupants he quickly read-justed his expression. ”Ah, thank you mygood man.”Stug’s eyes lighted on the communica-tions console in the pilot compartment andhe hastened up the aisle.”Where are we?” he said to the cleaningwoman as he passed. ”Is this an InterceptorStation?”The old woman chuckled. These peoplewho used yachts certainly were somethingto laugh about. ”Interceptor Station 62,close as you’ll ever get to it.” Laughing toherself she got busy with her broomsweeping the litter together.Doctor Stug tensely and expertlypunched a series of buttons on the commu-nication console and then slid into the chairbefore it. He adjusted the hypersound dialfor distance and then triggered the two but-tons which turned on a scrambler.The screen lighted up, was jagged for amoment, its lines snapping and smashinginto each other. It cleared and a picture ofChi came on.Chi glared at his own screen before himand then recognized who it was. He snarled"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS28impatiently, ”Stug! Where the crap haveyou been for a month?”Stug pulled the mike toward him,looking deadly. ”No time for tales. The lostones are at Interceptor Space Station 62.Just arrived.”Shock spread over the face of Chi,”That’s commanded by a Loyal Officer.”He paused, his eyes darting about. Then helooked back at his own viewscreen and acunning look which he thought was persua-sive came over his face. ”Stug, we have al-ways counted on you.””You’re counting on me now to thetune of a hundred thousand credits. Right?””Right.””I suggest you send a hyperspace inter-ceptor here at once, ” said Stug. ”Mannedwith a couple of reliable men, of course. Idon’t like asteroids.””All right, ” said Chi. He added fero-ciously, ”They must not talk!”Stug smiled. ”They won’t talk, ” hesaid smoothly and consolingly.The white doves, imported to decoratethe chambered gardens of the otherwisebleak asteroid and also to fall dead if airpollution rose dangerously, flitted aboutfrom perch to perch, the whir of their wingsmingling with the artificial waterfall. It wasa beautiful garden but in the opinion ofLady Min and Ap was no place to spendtwo days of idle waiting.They sat on a seat beside a heavilygrilled door, very strong in the black rock.True, they had been able to clean them-selves up even though no changes of clotheshad been offered them.But two days of waiting, despite theurgent notes they had sent the Base Com-mander, was creating a mystery that de-pressed their spirits.The door opened and a white-coatedservant entered carrying a tray. He walkedover to them and set his burden down.Lady Min caught at his sleeve as heturned to leave. ”Wait!””Listen, ” said Ap, ”we’ve been waitingtwo days to see the Base Commander. Hecan’t be that busy!”The servant shrugged and went outclosing and barring the door behind him.”I guess you get that way on an aster-oid base!” said Ap.Lady Min stared at the barred door.”Ap, something must be wrong! I feel it.Why should a Loyal Officer keep us wait-ing?””I sent him messages that you were thegreatest actress in the universe and had vitaldata.” He looked defensive. ”Maybe I’mflopping as a press agent! Probably.”They sank back hopelessly ignoring theluncheon tray.Some hours later the bolts grated andthe door opened. An officer uniformed inblue and white entered, followed closely bya uniformed guard who held his blast rifle atready.Coolly the officer said, ”The BaseCommander will see you now.”Ap looked at the guard, the blast rifleheld at ready, its safety lock off. ”FutureZero!” he whispered to himself.The officer escorted them through thelong tunnels and ramps which led upthrough the light gravity of the asteroid.The Base Commander’s office wasspacious even for an asteroid base. Behindthe desk was a large illuminated chart of thehome planet system with small patrol crafton pins. The kidney-shaped desk was longbut very narrow. The Base Commander wasyoung, guileless, with the optimism ofyouth and a bit bored. He was uniformed inLoyal Officer khaki but his collar was open.A holstered blast pistol was belted abouthis waist, but his hands folded behind hishead as he leaned back in his chair showedthat he considered the whole thing rather"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS29dull, not even really amusing.On his right sat Doctor Stug, smiling,smooth. Beside Doctor Stug and standingagainst the wall were two toughs in thegreen-grey and kepis of the secret police.The corridor door burst in and LadyMin, Ap and their escort entered.The scene was so different from any-thing she had been anticipating that LadyMin stopped in shock. Ap tried to backhurriedly out of the doorway but wasshoved forward by the guard’s rifle.Doctor Stug smiled professionally andaffably, ”Ah, come in, come in my dear.Don’t be frightened. These people won’thurt you.” He turned to the Commander,”It’s certainly a relief to know they can betaken back for the treatment they need,poor things.”The Base Commander nodded absently.Lady Min advanced to the edge of thedesk, ”Don’t listen to him.” She jerked herhead towards Stug. ”I am the Lady Min. Imust talk to you and quickly. Alone!”The Base Commander gazed at her lan-guidly.”As I said, poor girl, ” said Stug. ”She’salways had these paranoid hallucinations.Somebody after her. Messages of vast im-portance. I thought she had been cured and,well, there you are.” He began to rise.”So we’ll put them back in the institu-tion. Very sorry to have... ””Don’t listen to him! I am the LadyMin!”With a bored smile the Base Com-mander reached down to a waste basket andpulled out a newspaper. Spreading it on hisdesk he revealed a front page picture ofLady Min. The caption said, ”Lady Mingives charity ball. Yesterday Lady Min washostess to three thousand notables at a ballfor Charity to Stray Children.”The photograph was a very touched uppress photo showing Lady Min with a hugehead of hair and coronet.The Base Commander’s finger tracedalong the newspaper’s date. ”Then how is itLady Min was on the Capital Planet threedays ago and you are here?” He tossed thenewspaper aside and reclined back in hischair. ”She doesn’t even look like you.”Lady Min was getting furious withfrustration.”That’s a wig, you idiot. And that’s afake paper.”Stug again started to rise. ”Well, we’dbetter be going. She does bear some slightresemblance. Trades on it too.”Both Stug and the Base Commanderwere on their feet. The Base Commanderleaned forward with his knuckles on thedesk. ”Well I suppose these things happen.Glad to be of assistance... ”Lady Min put out her hand to stophim. ”Wait, I’ll prove to you that I’m astage actress. Look! What is that doing un-der your belt?”Dear God, let this thing work. With herleft hand she made a pass over his beltbuckle and then, gracefully, with her righthand appeared to pull a dove out from be-hind the belt buckle on the Commander’sstomach.The dove began to fly away in a madflutter of wings.Her darting left hand flipped his holsteropen and then in a fraction of a second hadtransferred his blast pistol to her left thigh,snapping her garter down on it and flippingher voluminous skirt over it.All eyes were on the dove whichpounded the air, veered off from Stug andfinally came to rest on a desk light.Stug rapidly interrupted anything theBase Commander was about to say, ”Yes,she always amused other patients with thattrick.” He gestured at the secret policemanwho promptly took hold of Lady Min andAp and pushed them toward the door."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS30”I’m certainly pleased with your coop-eration, Commander.” said Stug. ”With yourpermission, we’ll be taking off now forHome Planet.” He shook the Base Com-mander’s hand.”Say, by the way, ” said the BaseCommander, ”I thought the Secret CentralPolice had been disbanded.””Oh, those, ” said Stug. ”I think they’refinding them other jobs as fast as they can.Poor devils. Soon they’ll be out of work,the economy being as it is. Well, good-byeand thank you.””The Base Commander glanced at thedove and then back at Stug. ”You sure havesome interesting patients. Well, have a safetrip.”A few minutes later, in the hangar, thegreen sign ”Safe Atmosphere” began to goon and off as the huge side ports exhaustedand salvaged the hangar air. The red sign”No Air” flashed on. The hangar door beganto grind open.The Police spaceship interior was grey-green, like any prison. One secret policemanwas at the controls while the other finishedfastening the ramp lugs from inside.Stug shoved Ap and Lady Min backdown the aisle and slammed them into thetwo hard seats at the back of the ship. Par-tial bulkheads were on either side of the seatand it was ordinarily enclosed with a strongwire door.Shoulder-height thick straps were fixedto the seat back. Stug, with no gentle hands,snapped the strap shut across Ap’s chestand then turned to Lady Min. She wasshorter than the usual prisoner and the widebelt barely enclosed her shoulders. Stugtightened it with abrupt ferocity.”That will do until we get you trouble-makers on an operating table, ” said Stug.The ship surged forward with an as-cending whine and zoomed out of the han-gar into space.Stug steadied himself and then reachedfor the cage door, stepping outside the en-closure.Lady Min looked up to her right intoan area hidden from view from the forwardpart of the ship. An expression of shockedhorror and terror spread over her face.She screamed.”My God, ” shrieked Lady Min. ”Atime Bomb!”The pilot sprang up from his controlsand whirled to come back down the aisle.The other guard froze in paranoid horror.They very well knew their own service andthey had no slightest doubt that it was of-ten in the State interest that prisoners notarrive alive.”A time bomb!” screamed Lady Min.”They never intended us to reach therealive! Let me out!”Both guards were now rushing towardsthe back of the ship.Stug had ceased to close the cage door,He threw it open, fumbling with the lock,and then thrust his head into the compart-ment looking up toward the hidden spot.Lady Min hitched the strap up to thelevel of her throat. Her hand darted to herskirt and yanked it up, All in one motionshe threw the safety catch of the blast pis-tol and drew it from under her garter.Green violent flame hammered at Stug’sstomach pounding him back from the doorwith a massive blow.He went down.The nearest secret policeman skiddedto a halt. He clawed at his holster.Lady Min fired. The shot took him onthe left shoulder and spun him toplike, hisblast pistol flying up the aisle.The second secret policeman reachedfrantically for the bulkhead gunrack andyanked down a blast rifle.He brought it to his shoulder, aiming.Lady Min fired."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS31Her shot slammed into the muzzle ofthe blast rifle. Fragments of the weapondisintegrated the guard’s head and shouldersin a great gout of green flame.Smoke drifted and eddied along thefloor and through the cabin of the policecraft.The three bodies lay inert, pounded andcharred out of recognition.Lady Min stood up shakily.Tendrils of smoke spiraled up towardthe air circulators and purifiers.Lady Min gradually wound down.Ap, with a considerable struggle, gotout of his strap and stood up, steadyinghimself against the partial partition. Hecoughed in the green fumes.The ship’s motors continued in an ac-celerating whine. Its nose bored relentlesslyoutward into the vast emptiness of outerspace.Ap sighed, ”So now what do we do fornavigation?”CHAPTER EIGHTRawl stood alone on the parade groundof Galactic Base Earth.The brisk wind from the deep blue seasnapped and rustled in the flags. The paradeground was paved with white marble andsurrounded by a gilded and ornate balus-trade. In the far distance stood a volcano,the wind pushing its plume of smoke into ahorizontal banner. Ner, the black mountainwhich contained the barracks, vast hangarsand work shops, reared above the paradeground, its face honeycombed with hangardoors from which could spring a multitudeof defense and attack ships as well astransports.On the parade ground a band, brightlyuniformed in blue and white, played a mili-tary air.The wind rippled Rawl’s khaki. Helooked toward the two groups approachinghim, a faint smile on his lips and a trifle ofunfriendliness in his eyes.The first group was composed of thehigh ranking officers who had headed theEarth Secret Police Organization. Theywere uniformed in grey-green with muchgold braid.Zell, head of the Earth Secret Police,advanced with outstretched hand.”Well, it’s farewell Earth for us, ” saidZell as he shook hands.Rawl’s eyes were watchful. ”So you’releaving us to return to the Home Planet.Departing today?””Within the hour.” He looked aroundand sighed. ”All in all we of the Secret Po-lice have not been too unhappy here onEarth, ” he sighed. ”And on arrival homewe’ll be disbanded.””Fortunes of war, ” said Rawl.The Secret Police Chief could not quitekeep the viciousness out of his voice. ”Yes,well, that Congress of yours finished us.But it’s all for the best, of course. Our eightregiments will be getting spaceborne rightnow. So, fortunes of war, eh?”One by one the Secret Police executivesshook Rawl’s hand. All in all, Rawlthought, they were a seedy lot for all theirgold braid. They bore the mark of their pro-fession, a bit craven, shifty-eyed, and de-bauched.Rawl looked toward the second group.These were civilians, the heads of the Per-sonal Tax Collector Units.Their chief shook his hand. ”The taxclerks and staff all bid you farewell Com-mander Rawl. No more personal tax, hah,hah.”Rawl took his limp sweaty hand andshook it.” Are all your clerks and investiga-tors leaving as well?””Yes, we’ve pulled every one of themout of the two thousand cities of Earth. ”"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS32He gestured toward the looming base. ”It’sback to Home Planet and unemploymentfor all of us. ”The five civilian chiefs after him one byone shook Rawl’s hand and followed theSecret Police executives toward the en-trances and ramps of the base.But the tax chief could not resist a finaljibe. He turned when some distance off.”Watch your privacy doesn’t get invaded.”Rawl stood for some time watchingthem go, his eyes narrow, speculative. Theband ceased playing, its drummer boys be-gan to beat a march and it moved off.Rawl walked over and leaned againstthe gilded balustrade, his eyes still on thecliff face.The transports began to eject from thehangars one by one then two by two thenfour by four.At length Rawl gestured toward acommunicator ”Bring me a communicationscart!”The cart rolled forward, equipped withcompact panels and a view screen. Thecommunicator was pushing buttons on it,bringing it to life as he wheeled it forward.Rawl picked up a cubicle mike.”Get me Solar System InterceptorCombined Headquarters on Uranus. Com-mander Mish.”The communicator reached across thecart, pulled a lever and hit a red button.While he waited Rawl gazed at thepanorama of departing ships. Their soundwas punctuated with small explosions asthey ejected from the hangars, pulled upsteeply and cracked the sound barrier. Themore distant ones flashed pinpoints of lightas they cracked the light barrier after leavingatmosphere. Rawl gave his attention to thecart. ”Hello, Mish.”The view screen was a trifle sun-glaredand the communicator adjusted its hood.Mish’s face went clear. He was smiling. Hiscollar was unbuttoned, his cap was off andhe was drinking from a steaming cup. Hewas very glad to hear from Rawl.”Hello, Rawl. How’s the good planetEarth?””The Secret Police and income tax peo-ple, ” Rawl said into the mike. ”They’releaving the planet. About one hundred andfifty thousand of them.””Well, hip hurrah for them, ” said Mishsarcastically.”I’ll show you.” He turned the miketoward the cliff face.Mish stared intently at his own viewscreen, ”That’s sure a lot of transport.””That’s the point. They’re taking everytransport we’ve got. But why didn’t someof them stay here? They’re being dis-banded. Earth’s a good planet.””Ah”Rawl looked at the cliff’s face again andthe long extended parade of ships. ”Theytook it too tame, too cheerful in fact. Mish,I wish to smoke I had some reliable intelli-gence from Home Planet. It’s too quiet. I’mgetting nothing from there and haven’t for acouple of months.””You want me to run a patrol?””No, that would tell us nothing. What Iwant you to do is order every Solar SystemStation you have stock up on ammunition,fuel, food and spare parts. Got it?””Good. The day you can trust Xenuwill never dawn.” Rawl hung the mike onthe communications cart.The wind whipped at the flags. Thelong parade of departing ships made a lineacross the sky that was black and ominous.Rawl didn’t like it. Not one bit. He set-tled his cap against the tugging wind andcontinued to look at the sky.CHAPTER NINEThrough the windscreen of the Police"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS33interceptor ship Ap stared hopelessly atthe onrushing planet.A thunder and lightning storm wasraging in the lower atmosphere. They wereapproaching it awfully fast.”I can’t figure out what planet it is.We’re a long way from the solar system.Whatever star this planet belongs to, it’sgot atmosphere, maybe even oxygen.Maybe.”The atmospheric flaps of the policeship were down, bent and buckling. Thetips of the flaps were glowing incandescent.The tips began to burn and the flicker-ing light of the flame sputtered through thecockpit punctuated by the flashing of light-ning in the storm they were now entering.Lady Min was crouched down in herseat, her head turned away from Ap. Shewas crying quietly to herself.They were out of food, out of waterand their air tanks indicator was flashingdanger red.”Nothing about the Secret Police wasright including their mucked up ships.There’s no eject”’ He stabbed again at thered ”Emergency Decelerate” button.He rocked the manual controls again.They were limp. The auto pilot had evi-dently jammed in, engaged.”Buckle yourself in tighter. On the bot-tom side of this lightning storm is a crash!”He looked sideways and saw that LadyMin was crumpled up in despair. Hereached over and tightened her straps.The piercing shriek of the air rushingby made his nerves feel as though they weretearing apart.Belatedly deceleration cut in. Thestorm was all about them, the lightning cut-ting jagged blades of blue and yellow. Aflame from their burning wing tips danced inreflection across the windscreen.The air appeared to be solid water asthey struck into the torrents under theclouds.Ahead of them Ap could see an ex-panse of watersaturated jungle.A huge tree was rushing up at them.It struck in an explosion of leaves andlimbs.The striking ship made an enormousgeyser of mud.He had no recollection of how he gotout of the ship. A short time later he cameto himself crouching beside a jungle paththat was running torrents of water. LadyMin was on the ground where he had placedher. The drenching iciness of the rainbrought him out of it. He had no idea what-soever how he had gotten her out of theship.He bent over her, felt for her pulse andlooked in growing panic at her bloodlesslips and white face.A searing flash of red flame was fol-lowed with a hammer blow of concussion asthe police ship exploded some distancefrom them.He looked dazedly about him. Jungle,jungle, jungle. Jungle and rain.He stared at the torrent of water goingby them and realized at length that it was acart track, turned into a creek by the storm.Thunder rumbled. The distance he could seegrew slightly greater as the torrent lessened.But still there was nothing but jungle, jun-gle, jungle.He gently picked up Lady Min andstarted down the cart track, expecting atany instant to be pounced upon by wildbeasts or snakes.He walked along a river bank, his shoescollecting great globs of mud. He found an-other track, a broader one and trudged downit.The thunder muttered in the far dis-tance.Soaked, exhausted and stumbling, hedid not see the wall until he collided with it"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS34directly. He backed up and stared at it. Yes,it was a wall, green-grown and slimy butmade out of rocks. It was very high, so highhe could not see the top of it. It reachedfrom his left and from his right beyond anyvisibility.Then he saw that the cart track hadended at a small square door, itself almostobscured with vines.He staggered toward it and fumbled forits latch.”Future Zero, ” he sighed and pushedthe door inward.It was a room of rough stone, litteredwith odds and ends of metal. There was ahuge block of stone which served as a workbench or desk and sitting at it was a hulkingman in a filthy undershirt. The man did notlook up. Ap swept some pieces of metalout of his way and placed Lady Min gentlyin the corner. He shut the outside door.The man still had not looked up butcontinued to work on the bent barrel of ablast rifle which lay in pieces on the tablebefore him.”Are you the guys that crashed outthere a while ago?” He pushed the gun backin disgust, stretched and yawned.Ap crossed over to the table. Might aswell try. ”What place is this?, whatplanet?”The man finished his yawn and rubbedhis arms before looking up. ”This planet?This is the crummiest, louseforgotten,steam-beamed, ball of mud... ” He swept alazy arm. ”Welcome to Altec, pearl of theSouthern Galaxy. Welcome to Stip, gun-running capital of the Confederation, havenof the... ”Suddenly, he got angry. Half-risingfrom his seat,.he shook a grimy, grease-smeared finger at Ap. ”You know whathappened? When that Congress ripped upthem oppress orders, this place got to be acondemned, rip-blasted graveyard, that’swhat.”To Ap’s relief, the other man’s angerfaded. The man sat back in his chair with adeep sigh, despair written on his face. ”Nocrime means no guns. No explosives. We’rebroke, finished. Some of the best outlaws inthe Galaxy quit us and went back to honestwork.” He shook his head sorrowfully.Rallying, he banged a fist on the table,sending gun parts scattering and Ap’s alarmlevel up to a high pitch. ”Bird dung!” hesnorted.The man flung an angry glare at Ap andwent back to fiddling with his gun. ”Well,what the blast do you care?”Ap shuffled his feet uncomfortably. Ifonly he were back home, safe. Man lookednasty. ”Who’s in charge here?””I am, ” he muttered, still working onhis gun, ”but in charge of what? Fourteenthousand broken-down crooks and tenbusted-up ships.”He stabbed viciously at the gun, thenswung his arm in a wide arc. ”You see be-fore you the great outlaw leader, Sna, Lordof Stip. But don’t, ” he added, red eyessuspicious and tool jabbed toward Ap foremphasis, ”ask for a job. We’re so dead westink.”Losing interest, Sna returned to his gun.”Get out of here. Go on into town.” Hewaved the tool over his shoulder to indicatea back door. Boring, boring, boring. Nothingever happened anymore, and who gives adamn anyway?Giving up, Ap turned back to LadyMin. better check the town out. If thereeven is a town, maybe.Kneeling down, Ap anxiously checkedLady Min’s pulse. Its unsteady beatalarmed him, as did the dead white of herface. He looked back over his shoulder atSna and almost asked where a doctor couldbe found, but decided against it. The manwas ignoring him so pointedly, he probably"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS35wouldn’t have answered anyway.He eased Lady Min into his arms andstood up carefully. Picking his way acrossthe smoky room, he reached the door andwent through it, shutting it sharply behindhim.Outside, the rain had stopped but themain street of Stip before him was a nar-row, curving river of mud. Ap grimaced indismay, he’d had enough of mud. He lookedaround to get his bearings. The buildingswere decayed, obviously having passedtheir prime a long, long time ago. Crookedsigns poked out from dilapidated shops. Acouple of drunks were lying, lost in stu-porous slumber, on a flat stone slab thatfronted a sleazy bar. Wolf-like and heavilyfanged, a dog was walking up the street to-ward Ap. It stopped to sniff a drunk, thenmoved on.Ap shuddered. Friendly place, butwhere to now?.He studied the various signsand was thankful to see one that announceda ”Dr. Ax” and next to it, a ”Drug Empo-rium”Gently tightening his arms around LadyMin, he made for the Doctor’s house.The door was partially open, nearlyfalling off its hinges. Ap knocked and set-tled himself against the casing to wait. In-side, some bedsprings creaked. Shufflingfootsteps approached, bringing a gaunt,grizzled man with them.”Go ’way, ” grumbled Dr. Ax as he un-successfully tried to close the door. Paus-ing, he peered at his callers. ”You gotmoney?”Ap nodded and fished in his pocket.The doctor peered more closely at LadyMin. Fine gal, could do with more flesh onher bones. Looks pale, though... Catchingsight of a bill in Ap’s hands, Dr. Ax aban-doned his trail of thought and seized themoney. Ten Galactic credits! He jumped upand down, hardly able to contain his ex-citement.”Dregomine, ” he proclaimed breath-lessly, ”is vitally necessary.” He shoved thebill somewhere in his jacket and pushedpast Ap, heading for the Drug Emporium.”Take her to the Grand Hotel, ” hecalled back over his shoulder. ”I’ll be rightthere.”Ap glanced down the street to where itturned. Some hotel. Its sign had fallen off tolie in the debris beside some filthy steps.Wearily, Ap trudged toward it, at least itwould be warmer inside. Hopefully.The lobby had once been a fancy place.Now, it sagged sadly in advanced disarray.A man lounged on a divan, busying himselfwith a bottle, not looking over as Ap en-tered.”You got a room?”The man just stared at the ceiling. ”Do Ihave a room?” He laughed derisively.”When those income tax laws were in effect,you couldn’t get a room. Two hundred mil-lionaires in this town to escape tax. Wine,women, money everywhere. Then theycancel the law. The millionaires all go backhome. They don’t need a tax haven any-more.” He shook his head and took a gulpfrom the bottle.Annoyed, Ap repeated his question.”Do you have a room?”Eyes still on the ceiling, the man,waved the bottle. ”Take any you can find.Want to buy a hotel?”Ap grunted and gazed around thelobby. Place sure was run-down, he ob-served, even the elevators were out of order.Casting a final glare at the hotel proprietor,he proceeded up the stairs.Picking a random door, Ap entered aroom. Despite the smothering dust, it stillclung to an air of cheaply imitated luxury.Twisted drapes flanked a window thatlooked out over cloudy skies, rooftops andstone battlements. An unmade bed leaned"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS36against a peeling wall.Ap straightened out the covers, laid thestill unconscious Lady Min down on thebed and began to loosen her soaked, ice-coldclothes.Dr. Ax, having tracked Ap’s muddyfootprints, waltzed into the room and threwhis tattered bag down on the bedside table.Humming to himself, the doctor pro-duced a package from somewhere on hisperson and ripped it open to reveal a sy-ringe filled with a clear fluid. He rolled uphis sleeve and plunged the needle into hisarm.Ap raised an eyebrow as the doctorpushed down the plunger and drew the nee-dle out with a convulsive shudder.Smiling brightly, the doctor tossed thesyringe aside. ”Now that the preliminariesare attended to, let’s have a look at the littlelady.”After a long examination of Lady Min,accompanied by much bandaging and tune-less whistling, Dr. Ax signaled for Ap tofollow him out of the room.In the hallway, Ap closed the door be-hind them, patiently watching the doctorset his bag to rights.”She’s got concussion, three brokenribs and a torn ligament in her arm and thatwill be another ten credits, ” the doctor an-nounced, all in the same tone of voice.Ap glanced back at the door and fisheda bill out, jerking it back teasingly as thedoctor tried to snatch it. ”And how longwill she be laid up?””Two or three months, ” Dr. Ap re-plied, attempting to grab the bill.”And if you give her your very bestmedical attention... ?””Two months.””... And if you had a regular supply ofyour Dregomine?”Leaping high, the doctor grabbed thenote. ”Six weeks!” holding it lovingly, hefairly drooled over the bill. ”Six weeks, ” hewhispered again.”If these hold out, ” he added, a shadowof doubt crossing his wizened face.Ap pulled out another ten credit bill.”Five weeks, ” he said, holding on tightly asthe doctor tugged frantically at the bill.”Five weeks!” echoed Ax with a vigorousnod.The note released, Dr. Ax scuttled off.Re-entering the room, Ap crossed overto the window and leaned on the sill.Weeks! Five of ’em! And in the middle ofnowhere. That man, Sna, was right. This isa steam-beamed ball of... oh damn!CHAPTER TENThe music was awful. Broken for a longtime, the juke box skipped and fumbled itsway through the musical phrases. No onelistened anyway.Early yet, the hotel’s barroom-cum-nightclub had few occupants. Some bunged-up, one-eyed, -armed or -legged outlawslounged around. The bartender leaned on hiscounter, chin propped in hand. A black-outfitted pilot sat alone in an alcove, list-lessly fingering a handful of darts. Staringblankly at the wall before him, the pilotspun the occasional dart at it, bringing downflakes of plaster and insects.Near the mezzanine stairs, a group satplaying dice. The bulk of the square chipsspilled over beside Ap.The other players were having lessluck, their own meager piles of chipsproved it. Greedily eyeing the pot, theytensely waited for Ap to throw.Disinterestedly rattling three of theeight-sided dice, Ap had his mind else-where. A worried frown marked his brow ashe turned to the doctor. ”Doc, you said fiveweeks.”Dr. Ax shrugged. ”You got a day left. ”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS37His frown more pronounced, Ap threwthe dice, reached out. and pulled in the pot.”I think I had better go up and see if she’sconscious yet.”The hotel proprietor half-rose in pro-test as Ap began to push his chair back.”Hey, no! You can’t quit a winner likethat!”Sna laughed. ”He’s going to wind upthe richest man in Stip!” He turned hisleering face to Ap. ”Want to buy a gun-running base?”Suddenly reaching out and grabbingAp’s sleeve, Dr. Ax’s face was split in awide grin as he pointed to the mezzaninestairs.Following the doctor’s direction, Apsaw Lady Min there. Thin, face pale againsther gauzy red dress, she steadied herselfagainst the bannister as she carefully negoti-ated the steps downwards. A little trium-phant over her accomplishment, she smiledshyly at Ap and the others.Ap let out a long breath of relief.Starting to rise again, he stopped to look athis chips. To the doctor’s shocked sur-prise,.Ap shoved them at him, then heupped and raced for the stairs.Ecstatic, Ap reached Lady Min’s side.He couldn’t talk, was afraid to touch her.Not knowing what else to do, he whoopedin delight and hugged the bannister.The late afternoon crowds had driftedin. Brokendown outlaws smoked, drank andargued among themselves. The bartenderwas kept busy sloshing gut-rotting liquorinto ever-emptying glasses. The dog Ap hadseen weeks ago was there too, lying besidethe door.Just off the dance floor, Ap was ham-mering out a tune that had been popular inpro-Congress days on a beat-up electricpiano.Looking fully recovered and stunning ina golden gown, Lady Min was seated on thepiano, mike in hand.The song was one of longing to goplaces far away. Singing it with feeling,Lady Min directed frequent, meaningfulglances across the room to where the pilotsat in his alcove.But Pilot Tring ignored the song.Keeping his rapt attention on the roach-covered wall before him, he flipped a dart.Skewered right through the middle, a cock-roach scrambled its feet helplessly, thenexpired as silently as it had lived. Smiling tohimself, Tring settled back leisurely andraised a glass to his lips.A burst of applause followed thesong’s conclusion. Lady Min gracefully slidoff the piano and bowed to her audience.Keeping her demeanor professionallycharming, she vented some of her pique inan aside to Ap. ”I don’t believe he’s hu-man!”Ap, poker-faced, hardly moved his lipsas he replied. ”Human or not he’s the onlypilot here that has a spaceship that can getus to Earth. If it’s still there.”Blowing a last kiss to the cheering men,Lady Min set down the mike and weavedher way through the overturned chairs tothe end alcove.Paying no attention whatsoever to theapproaching vision, the pilot just flipped adart as Lady Min perched provocatively onhis table. She leaned over and spoke softlyto him. ”Changed your mind about the char-ter?”Tring still didn’t look up. ”Politics Ihate” he stated, flipping a dart.”Galactic Confederation I hate.” Flip.He paused to consider a moving targeton the wall. ”Women I hate, ” he added,flinging the dart.Nonchalantly, Lady Min pulled ajoined string of glittering jewels from herbosom to dangle them in the pilot’s face.”Jewels, ” she said soothingly, ”are cur-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS38rency in any galaxy.”No response. She sighed in discourage-ment and put the jewels away. Getting toher feet, she began to move back to the pi-ano, when the door across the room wasburst violently open.Sna entered, knocking the yelping dogflying. A strip of paper waving in his trem-bling hand. ”Hey, hey listen!” he shouted.”We’ve been saved!”The room went very still. Only thedog, barking in outrage, made any move-ment.Overcome with jubilation, Sna barrelledforward to stand imposingly in the center ofthe dance floor. ”I got a special secret mes-sage from the Minister of Police. We beenrecruited. Every able-bodied man on thisbase has been made a special agent. Andevery ship we got has been put into Con-federation service!”The hush in the room ceased abruptly.Outlaws leapt to their feet and surged for-ward, calling to friends and foe alike, ex-changing heated opinions and speculations.A few people, however, were notpleased, one being Tring who stood up,wide-eyed, tense. Clenching his fists in an-ger and trepidation, he hissed furiously.”That’s just one ship- mine.”Meanwhile, Lady Min threw an ago-nized glance at Ap. Racking her brains, shesignalled her hastily construed plans to him.He rolled his eyes. ”Future zero!” Turning,he moved to unobtrusively follow Sna asthe man ploughed through the surgingthrong toward the pilot’s alcove.”There you are, Pilot Tring, ” Snaboomed, all bonhomie. ”Just the man Iwanted to see.”Tring stared at Sna, hands fiddlingnervously with his holster flap. Rip-blastedphony; who’d he think he was. Not goingto fork over my ship. No way! ”Youwhat?””Here’s the message. Just came in.” Snabrandished the paper under the pilot’snose.” ’The whole blasted base, every out-law recruited in the service of the Ministryof Police. High ranks, high pay! And everyship taken into service... ”The pilot convulsively clutched the ta-ble. ”There’s just one ship here – mine!”Unnoticed by either man, Ap slippedbehind the pilot as Tring’s voice rose to ascream.”I wouldn’t work for the condemnedblasted Confederation for anything!”Unperturbed, for he had an over-whelming faith in his ability to get what hewanted, Sna laid a pacifying hand onTring’s arm. ”Ah, now, now, now. Not fora thousand credits a week?”Easing a pistol from under his jacket,Ap pressed it lightly into the pilot’s back.Tring kept his eyes riveted on Sna who,unaware, continued his persuasions.”This is your chance. This is all ourchances. Why, man, they’ll make you ageneral or something... ”By now, Ar, had picked up the pilot’sjacket and was draping it over his arm andgun.Sna shook the paper vigorously. ”Allcharges forgotten, look. Look at the mes-sage!”Still, Tring had made no move. Ap,having completed the masking of the gun,glanced up at the mezzanine where LadyMin stood. She nodded at him, a wad ofcoats over her arm and two grip cases in herhand.Ap turned back to face Sna and spokeconvincingly in the pilot’s ear. ”Pilot Tring,it sounds pretty unreasonable, I know, butlook, Tring. This is your chance!”The pilot made no reply. Just slittedhis eyes as the gun jabbed him slightly inthe back.”Tring, ” continued Ap, ”as an old"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS39friend, please tell Sna you’ll do him thisfavor.”Swallowing spasmodically, the pilotmanaged to choke out an ”All right.””In fact, ” Ap jabbed the gun again, ”I’llhelp Pilot Tring get his ship ready. You’llneed it for transport. Let’s go!”Beaming, overjoyed, Sna stepped backto let them pass.Steering the pilot over to the exit, Apbegan trembling with relief. Stage one of theescape plan done... maybe.Fortunately, the spaceport was de-serted.Lady Min was standing anxiously inthe boarding door of Tring’s craft. Thecoats and cases lay in a heap beside her. Shechewed a fingernail, dear God let themcome!Hearing running footsteps, she lookeddown to see the pilot and Ap runningacross the landing field. She beckoned ur-gently to them as they raced up the stairs tothe flight platform, and stepped back as thetwo men crowded through the door.Tring hurried up the aisle and scram-bled into the pilot’s seat, hands reaching forthe controls. Ap came to stand behind him,gun now held openly.Through the windshield, the blue of thelate afternoon sky was pierced by the occa-sional spire. The tangible silence was bro-ken only by the whine of the ship’s startingmotors.With a lurch, they took off, the accel-eration pressing the ship’s passengers downand back, forcing Ap to grab the co-pilot’sseat in order to keep his gun trained on thepilot.Suddenly, the pilot began to laugh.Loud, extravagant, the sound mingled withthe rising shriek of engines.Banking the ship again, Tring tried tostill his laughter. Without looking back, hefinally managed to speak. ”You can put thatgun away. You didn’t even need it. You didme a huge favor getting me out of there.They would have killed me for my ship.”Startled, Lady Min and Ap stared atthe pilot, roundeyed in amazement. Thenthey too burst into laughter.Ap looked at his gun and put it away.Reaching over, he clapped the pilot on theback. Guy must be all right, take us toEarth, maybe.CHAPTER ELEVENSurrounded by huge trees, Xenu’s se-cret base on Home Planet was dominatedby a single domed building.Low and ominous, military drums beata deadly rhythm. Rank upon rank of grey-green uniformed secret police, fully armed,lined the parade ground in military forma-tions. Over by the operations dome, an ill-dressed mob of renegades stood watching.An inspections party walked throughthe ranks, headed by Xenu and Chi. Withthem were tough looking renegade guards,several high ranking officers of the secretpolice, Zel the ex-Chief of Secret PoliceEarth and Sty the chief psychiatrist.Xenu curiously inspected the troops ashe passed them by. He turned to thesweating Chi to bark a query. ”Are you surethis base is still secret and secure?”Chi mopped his brow with a soakedhandkerchief. Fool idea, this inspection.Too hot for it. Damned question anyway,Xenu already knew his orders on securityhad been carried out to the letter. ”We’veshot anyone who comes close to it.”Xenu nodded. ”Then we’re almostready.””Indeed we are, ” Chi agreed, notingthankfully that Xenu was starting to headfor the operations building.Stopping before the band of renegades,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS40Xenu banged his cane to catch the regard ofone of the two slouching Chiefs of theRenegades. ”And those men?”The Renegade Chief smiled evilly, dis-playing a broken row of yellow teeth.”Those are my finest renegades, sir. Thefinest and best criminals in the Galaxy, fitfor deviltry. And thousands more ready onevery planet.”Again, Xenu nodded and moved on.Halting abruptly, Xenu turned back tothe Renegade Chief. ”Get them in whitecoveralls. They look like something from asewer.”Obeying Xenu’s next signal to followhim, the Chief sauntered along behind therest of the party. He scowled at Xenu’sretreating back, scowled at his deputy chiefbeside him.Steam-beamed maniac. Must have aloose screw in his finicky head – lily-whitecoveralls? Nuts!Ignoring the outbreak of ragged cheeringamong the renegade mob, Xenu led the wayup the stairs and through the arched doorsof the operations building.The actual operations office was lo-cated in the dome of the building. Thesloped walls, painted with stars and plan-ets, served as an operations map and werestudded with abundant miniature space-ships and flags. Crouching below, a hugetable was flanked on one side with threelarge rollers. On the other side, by a rackstacked high with papers.Xenu entered the room, banging thedoor wide as he came, and limped across tothe table. The two secret police clerks,standing rigidly to attention, were wavedbrusquely aside.Putting his cane down, Xenu picked upa hooked stick and turned to face his offi-cers. Slap-slapping the hook in his palm, heregarded his officers for a moment.Blackguards, the lot of them, but theyhad their uses, oh yes they had their uses.The men returned Xenu’s regard, alertand expectant, though the animosity wasmutual.Finally, Xenu began his address. ”Thisis your last and final briefing. Listen care-fully.”He reached out with his stick andhooked it into the ring of the lowermostroller. ”This is a Phase One of the galactic-wide action.” With a savage yank, he pulledout a chart from the roller that spread itselfout, flat, on the table.He rapped the stick on the first pile ofpapers on the rack. ”And those are the de-tailed orders ready to issue.”The objective of Phase One, ” Xenucontinued, his voice losing all trace of itssurface urbanity, ”is the slaughter of everyLoyal Officer in the Galaxy.”Grim and silent, his men nodded.Reaching forward, Xenu engaged thesecond roller with his hooked stick. ”Phasetwo: The destruction of the main galacticdefense base on every planet.”Brutally, he yanked out the secondchart so that it covered the first. He rappedthe second stack of papers. ”And the de-tailed orders.”With a nasty, irritating screech, thethird chart was unfurled.Xenu struck thelast stack of papers. ”Phase Three: The re-moval of all minority and unwanted popula-tions in the Galaxy to the planet Earth andtheir extermination.”A slow smile crossed his face. ”I thinkyou will find this solves all problems ofoverpopulation, crime and finance in theGalaxy as well as preventing our being de-posed. Before Minister Chi issues the de-tailed orders, are there any comments?”The momentary silence was broken bya sardonic Renegade Chief. ”You’re thepaymaster, ” he sneered, running a handthrough his hair."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS41Xenu glared the other down. And you –you’re a prime bastard. Indicating for Chi totake over, Xenu retrieved his cane andstalked from the room, favoring his bad leg.On the parade ground, the miscellane-ous groups were breaking up.Regiments of secret police and bands ofrenegades marched purposefully towardsassigned destinations. Drums quickening inpace, the military ensemble also took theirleave.Soon, only the litter remained to bearthe wind and the scattered guards company.Chi was standing on the roof, silhouet-ted against the stars.His left hand held a radio transmitter.In his right, the dial of a stopwatch was il-luminated by an electric lantern.In his mind, he reviewed the injunctionsthat Xenu had given him concerning PhaseOne. Missed anything? Didn’t seem thatway, but still... he glanced down at thestopwatch. With maddening slowness, thesecondhand approached the appointedhour. Too late anyhow!He clicked the stem of the timepieceand spoke into the radio. ”Phase One!”Paring his nails with a deeply notchedknife, one of the Renegade Chiefs sat in hisdark, unkempt office.A speaker near his head crackled to life.”Phase One!”The Chief lifted his chin to a nearbyflunky.The aide disentangled himself from hischair and began to shuffle out the room.Vexed at the man’s dawdling, the Chiefthrew his knife between the other’s feet.”Get going, ” he snapped.The second Renegade Chief stood inthe Intergalactic Control Center, outlinedagainst the lighted curve of a communica-tions panel. Beside him bristled a battery ofmicrophones. Surrounding him was a tangleof wires.The panel itself was a maze of jack-plugs and the brightly lit names of the Ga-lactic Confederation member stars: Sirius,Canopus, Alpha Centauri, Vega, Capella,Arcturus, Rigel, Procyon, Achernar, BetaCentauri, Altair, Betelgeuse, Acrux, Aldeba-ran, Pollux, Spica, Antares, Fomalhaut,Deneb, Regulus and Sol.Whistling tonelessly, the renegadechecked to ensure all stars were connectedup to the mikes. They were. He flicked aswitch and spoke. ”All systems, all planets.Phase One!”Car headlamps swung across the frontof a suburban house, coming to rest aimedat the garage as the vehicle entered thedriveway.A Loyal Officer in his khaki coat andcap cut the engines and stepped out of thecar. Startled, he looked up as a spotlightsuddenly stabbed at him from the dark.Two blast guns fired.Hit, the Officer slammed back againstthe car and crumpled to the ground.Two men in white coveralls ran over tohim. One stretched out a booted foot andlifted the Officer’s shoulder to see if he wasdead.He was.A Loyal Officer trotted up the broadwhite stairs leading up to a governmentalbuilding.Rifles blasted, taking his arm off at theshoulder.Leaving a trail of red, he rolled slowly,inexorably, back down the steps.Frowning over some despatch, a LoyalOfficer never noticed as two white-coverall’ed men entered his office.Raising their blast guns, they aimed andfired, pounding the Officer to the wall be-hind him, then down to the floor.

He lookedup, alert, as a grenade-like object hurtled byto strike the ship’s side.A flash of fire erupted and leapt for theskies.Shortly, the conflagration died downenough to reveal the dismembered craft, andbeside it, a shriveled form.In his darkened office, the first Rene-gade Chief was biting the end of a pencil. Astack of papers lay on the desk before him,the top list entitled: Loyal Officers CapellaSystem.The radio spoke. ”Planet Chellis. Lieu-tenant Dahn.”The Chief hunted for and found thename.

At last that wrappedup the list for the Polaris System.Daylight, filtering through from some-where, encroached upon Chi’s red-rimmedeyes.The room was quiet now that the gar-rulous speaker-units were silenced.The exhausted orderly, wearily grip-ping his enormously grown sheaf of papers,made a report: ”Polaris System, Phase One,All Clear.”In a final, flourishing manner, Chi drewa large circle.

Andonly those in the planetary Galactic Basesthemselves.”Xenu relaxed somewhat. ”We’ll get theGalactic Bases in Phase Two so that ’ s noworry. Keep a news blackout going and putbusy signals on all Loyal Officer networks.And keep working on those InterceptorBases.”He switched off the circuit and rubbedhis jaw, chuckling to himself.Soon, soon. Victory was in sight. Hechuckled again, and resumed his reverie.CHAPTER TWELVEIn outer space hung the black asteroidthat was the interceptor Control CenterSolar System.Mish stood on a glassed-in balconyappended to the asteroid’s side. He com-pleted a sweep of the star-studded voidsand lowered the long-range viewing instru-ment. He felt vaguely uneasy, disturbed –by what, he didn’t know.Unexpectedly, the door-way behindhim filled with intermittent green flashes.Mish whirled around and dropped theviewer to grab his gun.Moving inside, he was brought upshort by the tableau posed within. A juniorLoyal Officer stood frozen in aftershock,his blast rifle still smoking in his hands.Over by the main entrance, two renegadeswere sprawled over the doorsill, a mist ofgreen wisps rising from their bodies. A pis-tol lay where it had fallen, just beyond therenegade’s out stretched arms.The junior Officer unsteadily downedhis rifle and pivoted around to face Mish,his voice breaking as he spoke. ”These twowere in that small ship that said it was introuble.”Mish continued to stare in dismay atthe bodies, hardly hearing as the junior Of-ficer went on speaking: ”They came in herewith drawn guns.”Rousing himself, as if from a nightmare,"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS44Mish strode over to the communicationspanel, elbowing the communicator there outof the way.Rapidly jabbing buttons, Mish cursed.Blast! Nothing but hell-fired busy signals.He banged his fist down in frustration, grit-ting his teeth as he said: ”Home Planet net-work still busy.”The junior Officer joined him at theconsole. ”I’ve been trying all day. Only acouple of our Interceptor Bases are an-swering up.”Exasperated, Mish punched anotherbutton. ”I’ll try Earth.”Rawl appeared on the screen. ”GalacticBase Earth... ” He began in a clipped voice,then seeing who was calling, he continued ina friendlier tone. ”Oh, hello, Mish.”Mish made an effort to calm himself.Thank God at least this circuit was opera-tional. He leaned closer to the video scan-ner. ”There’s something going on, ” he said.”I can’t get in touch with Home Planet onthe Loyal Office circuit.”Rawl shrugged ”It’s happened before.”Mish slammed his hand on the consoleand swore. ”Not at the same time as an at-tempt on my life!”Taken aback, Rawl blinked. ”I’ll try iton the Galactic circuit.”Cutting the line, Rawl gestured to hiscommunicator who proceeded to make theconnection. Busy signal.Seeing the communicator was only get-ting jammed lines, Rawl ordered another linebe tried. ”Get Xenu on Home Planet. TheSupreme Ruler emergency lines ought to beopen”Xenu’s face flashed onto the screen,smiling suavely. ”Ah, Rawl. Glad to hearfrom you. What can I do for you?”Rawl gazed at Xenu’s image briefly, awave of acute dislike for the man passingthrough him. ”There are a lot of communica-tion channels that don’t seem to be work-ing. Busy. Thought you might know.”Xenu raised his eyebrows in innocentsurprise. ”Is that so?”Impatiently indicating an affirmative,Rawl raised his voice in vexation at theother’s playacting. ”I wanted to be sure thiswasn’t another Grey Invasion.””I’ve heard nothing like that, ’’ soothedXenu, with an air of offended worthiness. ”Idid hear there was some trouble with somenew equipment that had just been installed.We’re having to economize, you know... ”unable to resist a dig, his voice hardened,”since the personal income tax was abol-ished.”Thinking fast, Xenu saw a possible ad-vantage. Schooling himself back into pleas-ant urbanity, he resumed speaking. ”But ifyou’re worried, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’llschedule space fleet maneuvers in your areaover the next few days just to make sure.”Sharply breaking the connection, Xenuswiveled his chair around to snarl at Zel andChi seated by his massive desk. ”Rawl andpossibly other Planet Base Commanders aregetting suspicious.”Acutely uncomfortable, as always inXenu’s presence, Chi stared down at hishands and muttered something inaudible.Ignoring his Minister of Police, Xenuforgot his displeasure. Gloating for an inter-val, he then exalted in his next words.”Launch Phase Two.”CHAPTER THIRTEENIntensely, Tring studied a radar screen.He didn’t like what he saw there.

Thicker thancockroaches.”He leaned back and turned to present awhite face to his passengers. ”I’m not goingin there!”Lady Min and Ap stared, appalled, atthe pilot. He couldn’t fail them – not now!Tring waxed persuasive. ”This Galaxyis getting too hot. Gone to buzzard bait.Listen, I’ve got a cache of fuel, food and airout on an asteroid. I’m going out there andfuel up and make the long jump to anothergalaxy.” He raised a hand in mute appeal.”You’re a couple of nice guys. There’s allblazes about to break loose. I can feel it.Those jewels you got will serve as cur-rency. How about it?”Lady Min had gone rigid. ”’We’ve gotto get to Rawl.” she insisted. ”How do weget down?”Shrugging, Tring squared himselfaround and got back to flying. He’d donehis best. ”All right if you want to getburned, ” he called back over his shoulder.”There’s oxygen masks and parachutes un-der that seat. Put them on and get into theairlock. I’ll spill you into the stratosphereover the base, and even that’s risky.”Shaking his head, he snorted sadly. ”Pa-triotism!” Well, he’d tried. Pity. Bankingthe ship, he took it downwards.Rawl was standing in his office, gazingup at the overhead. A heavy rumble ofship’s motors filling his ears. Somethingwas going on, he was sure of it. But what?Faces echoing Rawl’s apprehension,two orderlies and a communicator werestanding nearby. Rawl swung round andspoke to the communicator. ”Maneuvers!Have you got any answer yet to why Earthships were not invited to take part?”The man shook his head, perplexed.Hadn’t been able to raise the damned ships,let alone get an answer!Rawl pointed at one of the orderlies.”Pass the order to get my ship ready forimmediate blast-off. I’m going to do a flybyand look this over.”The orderly up and raced off. Rawlglanced back up at the ceiling. Can’t figurethis out...He frowned, pounding an agitated fistinto his palm. Moonshine! He wasn’tachieving anything by moping around hisoffice. He strode over to a wall hook andtook down his flight coat. Going out thedoor, he paused to call a command back tothe remaining orderly. ”Sound a base alertjust in case.”Base alert was sounded. Klaxon hornsrent the air with an insistent note. Severaltroops, uniformed in blue and white, ranacross the parade ground towards theirvarious stations. Hatches in the loomingcliff face, cranked open to reveal dozens ofsnub-nosed anti- spacecraft guns. Officersyelled directions to their crews.Unobserved in the flurry, two para-chutes, one hanging higher than the other inthe blue sky, swung down from upwindtowards the parade ground.Lady Min landed first, rolling awk-wardly to absorb her fall’s impact. Scram-bled to her feet, she ripped off her oxygenmask and, grabbing the chest release buckle,yanked hard. Her parachute and harnesswent sailing away.She ran a hand through her disheveledhair and stared round-eyed at all the com-motion. Jumping forward, she gripped thearm of a passing soldier. He skidded to ahalt in obvious impatience.”Where is Commander Rawl?” sheasked, breathless.He pointed to the cliffed hill anddashed off before she could speak again.Now landed and rid of his parachute,Ap came to stand by Lady Min. He raised"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS46an inquiring eyebrow.She tugged at his sleeve. ”Rawl’s up atthe hangars. Come on!” She turned andraced off, Ap close behind, muttering tohimself between his ragged breaths.Some orderlies looked up in surprise asLady Min and Ap barged into Rawl’s cliff-side office.”Where ’ s Commander Rawl?”An orderly indicated one of the otherdoors. ”He’s about to blast off.”Lady Min looked at him beseechingly,wringing her hands in desperation. Oh no!They couldn’t be so close yet too late.”This is urgent, ” she wailed. ”Urgent!”The orderly was puzzled. He didn’tknow who or what this lady was, but someof her agitation had been communicated tohim. Decisively, he waved an arm for themto follow and raced out the room.Rawl slid into his Interceptor’s Pilotseat and strapped himself in. The ship’smotors roared as he touched the starter.Eyes and hands roaming across the con-trol panel, Rawl readied the ship for take-off while speaking into his radio-mike.”Control. Interceptor One immediatelaunch.”Suddenly, the boarding door was flungopen. Rawl turned and was amazed to seeLady Min and Ap sprawl into the aisle ofhis craft. ”Lady Min!”The mass of Galactic bombersswooped low over the base. A bay openedin the belly of one of them, and a singlebomb was released.It hung there, motionless, for an in-stant, then plummeted downward, an angelof death.Rawl shot a glance through the wind-screen. Good, the hangar door was begin-ning to open. His radio crackled as Controlgave launching clearance. Assured he couldblast off at any moment, he swung back toface the aisle.Lady Min had picked herself up, andwas scrambling towards him. ”I’ve got datafor you, ” she gasped. ”Urgent data... ”Rawl motioned her in brusquely. ”Youcan tell me as soon as we blast off.”The hangar door was now opened allthe way. Rawl pulled back on a lever andthe Interceptor lurched forward to soargracefully up into the cerulean heavens.The bomb hit the base with an incan-descent atomic blast.Hurtling debris and smoke swept tu-multuously across what had previouslybeen a parade ground. The whole cliffbuckled, collapsed. Turning into a roaringavalanche it slid down to disappear into thesea.In other words, the entire base blew up.Savagely working the controls, Rawlfought to steady his spinning ship.Lady Min and Ap, trying desperatelyto hold on, were knocked about violently asthe craft bucked and shook.Gaining the upper hand, Rawl rocketedthe ship upwards. Soaring a glance at theholocaust below, he grimaced. So that waswhat Xenu was up to. A sharp lurchbrought his attention back to the controls.They weren’t out of it yet.Not by a longshot...CHAPTER FOURTEENNight was spreading her dark wingsover the secret base on Home Planet.Shady figures milled around the gloom-ily lit interior of the operations room –guards, the two Renegade Chiefs and severalbearded psychiatrists among them.At the table was Chi, holding a felt pen.He was sweating profusely because Xenuwas also there.Xenu, intent on the spreading PhaseTwo chart, listened with half an ear to Chias his Minister called out stars and planets"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS47in a quavering, singsong voice.”All Galactic bases Vega System, ”chanted Chi, putting a cross-mark on thechart.He continued his litany.”All bases Spica.” Made a cross.”All Galactic bases Altair.” Made an-other cross.Then the speaker box piped up. ”Ga-lactic base Earth totally destroyed.”Cheered by this news, Chi exchanged alook of satisfaction with Xenu and drew anexaggeratedly large cross on the chart. Atravesty of a smile curving his mouth, heglanced back up at his boss. ”End PhaseTwo. ”Now all opposition is removed,what are your next orders?”Thoroughly enjoying himself, Xenustretched, stood up and stretched somemore. So this was what it felt like to be Su-preme Ruler in full sweet fact.He searched for his cane, couldn’t findit, and hobbled over to the center of theroom anyway. Assuming a splendiferouslymajestic pose, conscious that all eyes wereon him, he spoke, savoring each word to thefullest. ”Issue an all-Galactic proclamation.’Due to crime wave, martial law is estab-lished on all planets.”’He raised a pompous hand. ”Gentle-men, we begin Phase Three. We are regain-ing political control of all planets. Even atthis moment our planted agents will beseizing all governmental centers. But this isnot enough!” He made a chopping gesture.”As you well know, minorities and peoplewho might object, which is to say inde-pendent thinkers, protest a perfectly func-tioning police state, the ideal form of gov-ernment. Furthermore, our planets areoverpopulated. Phase Three consists ofrounding up such people on every planet,transporting them to Earth and exterminat-ing them.”A murmur of agreement spread throughthe listening group.One of the Renegade Chiefs, seeking anadvantageous opening in these affairs, re-garded Xenu through slitted eyes. ”If mymen are to do this, they have to be withinthe law.”Chi was as happy as he could ever get,especially when he was in such closeproximity with Xenu. He butted in with arush of words. ”All worked out. We are cre-ating the Confederate Bureau of Investiga-tion under the newly formed Justice De-partment.Every one of your renegades are as ofthis moment appointed government agentsG-men – with full official powers.” Sosaying, he grinned like a wolf, albeit with atrace of bulldog.The Renegade Chief replied with awolfish grin of his own. He knew opportu-nity when he saw it.Xenu stamped his good foot for atten-tion. Getting it, he continued speaking.”The selection of these minorities is alreadydetermined. However, certain scientificjudgement is required concerning others. Forthis reason, we have appointed you, the topleaders of the psychiatric profession... ”The bearded men, the psychiatrists, inthe group leaned forward expectantly,hanging on Xenu’s every word.”... to handle the ultimate fate of mi-norities and to decide who should be exter-minated.” Xenu paused theatrically, thenadded a magnanimity. ”I know you will doso in a fully scientific and dedicated man-ner.”Gravely, seriously, the psychiatristsnodded in unison. Sty, top dog amongst thiselite cream the noble profession of psychia-try, nodded with particular emphasis,pleased with this arrangement. His long-sought lucky break at last.Xenu’s surface urbanity slipped.”They must, ” he screamed, ”never trouble"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS48us again!”Checking himself, he got his mask backin place, continued in a more subdued pitch.”The gathering from every planet shall be-gin. The extermination site is Earth.”He drew himself up to his full, if incon-siderable height. ’’Gentlemen, I officiallyannounce the beginning of Phase Three.”As if by prearranged signal, several or-derlies entered, bearing trays laden withbottle and glass. Someone had switched on astereo, and soothing music filled the room.Drinks were passed around.Xenu raised his glass. ”And now, atoast... ”A family was seated at their middaymeal. They started in shock as a gun buttbanged loudly, three times, against theirdoor, followed by a booted foot kicking itopen. Two uniformed men entered on therun.Obeying the signalling blast rifle, thefamily rose shakily. With rising terror, theywere impelled out of the room.The youngest, a little girl, screamed andclutched her mother’s skirts. A viciousblow on the head silenced her.Sobbing aloud, the mother picked upher child, and was thrust onwards.A street, lined with three-storiedhouses, was a pandemonium of panickingpeople.Secret policemen herded struggling men,women, and children out through exits anddown into the street.A little to the side, a psychiatriststood, looking on, a loud hailer in his hand.Protesting and bewildered blacks werebeing gathered from the shops and homes oftheir neighborhood by a group of bellowingsecret police.A second group of grey-green uni-formed men who were in the center of thestreet, received the people passed to them.They held order with violent bashings andsweeps of their rifles.In a white, middle-class suburb, a col-umn of despairing yet striving individualswere being force-marched down an avenue.The laugh of a young secret police offi-cer could be heard above the din.

Her sobs weremuffled by the sounds of bootbeats anddragging steps.One of the Renegade Chiefs joined thepsychiatrist at the panel in the IntergalacticNetwork Communications control tower.Bored, the Chief fiddled with his rifle,absentmindedly listening to the psychia-trist’s droning voice broadcast a set of de-terminations.”Vega System exterminations list: Re-ligious leaders, athletes, musicians, teachers,salesmen.

Theybrandished their hypos ferociously. Thesyringes contained a smoky, gaseous drugthat induced instant unconsciousness forlong, indeterminate periods of time.Secret policemen knocked down or heldindividuals for the white-jackets to inject –in arms, legs, whatever.Moaning, a woman struggled to rise andcollapsed as a smoking needle was injectedinto her back.White-jackets moved through acrowded garbage dump. In their wake, theyleft inert, motionless bodies to lie in heaps.A constant stream of captives floodedthrough the gates at the far end of the sta-dium. Moving fast to keep apace with theflow, white-jackets competently wieldedtheir hypos.A public address system squawked.”Trucks will be here in three hours.”A white-jacket glanced over at one ofhis fellows. Would this river of bat-brainedcrackpots ever end?A multitude of weaponless soldiers at-tired in the Loyal Corp’s blue and white,were being wrestled into submission bygrim, sweat-faced secret police.The first of them was knocked downand then put out by a white-jacket’s smokyneedle.And thus the Ninth Terrestrial Armywas overthrown.Muttering secret police loaded the un-conscious into a convoy of trucks.The bodies were landing haphazardly,just tossed in as if they were so muchcordwood.It was night again. The Renegade Chiefhad moved to stand by one of the tower’swindows. He flicked an ash on the floor,too tired to fetch an ashtray. Loosening hiscollar further, he leaned back against the sillto watch the psychiatrist.Disinterested, but asked all the same,he spoke to the psych. ”How many mil-lions is it so far?”Himself exhausted and unusually un-tidy for a member of his exalted vocation,the psychiatrist shrugged. ”The BetelgeuseSystem has not reported yet.”The Chief looked back out the windowand took a drag of his cigarette. Slipperyfish, these nut-crackers. Never can getstraight answers out of them. Probably asbuggy as their so-called patients, any-way. He spat on the wall.In innumerable spaceports across thatGalaxy, a similar scene was occurring. Longlines of transport vans drove up besidespace-freighters. Rumpled secret policetransferred inanimate forms from the trucksinto the receiving arms of renegades whosejob it was to stack the bodies in the ships.The little girl, now drugged into insen-sibility but still hugging her doll close, wasdragged out of a truck and dumped into afreighter.The renegade who had stacked herturned to his assistant and cracked a jokeabout child-girls. The assistant sniggeredand swung his boot at the piteous figure.Operation round-up was nearing itsconclusion. The last few ”undesirables”were hunted down, knocked flat, anddrugged up.The space-freighters, loaded over andabove maximum capacity, were ready forblast-off.Chi peered up at his boss.

A renegade and a psy-chiatrist stood on the control tower’ s ob-servation platform, looking out over thelanding field.The psychiatrist checked over a list.”That completes this planet, ” he an-nounced. ”As soon as your ships are ready,I suppose you can tell your pilots to pro-ceed to Earth.”The renegade sneered. ”You sure yougot ’em all?”The psychiatrist gave him a frosty re-gard. ”My dear fellow, medical sciencenever makes mistakes.”Bleary-eyed and rumpled, the RenegadeChief struggled to stay awake.

Right on time.”Xenu’s eyes narrowed with cruelpleasure. ”Good, good. Proceed as ordered.”Shutting off the video-phone, he turnedto stare out his window. Just as planned,Like clockwork...He snickered softly to himself.A wind roamed mournfully across theshattered pavement of what had been, oflate, the proud parade ground of GalacticBase Earth. Blackened balustrades and bro-ken flagpoles silhouetted themselves againstthe empty sky.But not empty for long.The whine of their engines growing intoa steady roar, a multitude of ships began tomass across the heavens till the skies wereliterally filled with freighters of every size,shape and description.Over a wide, barren plain, a cliff facewatched as the cargoes arrived.Using no runways – there were norunways to use – the ships simply landedin place, covering the entire field from endto end.A harried Controller darted a frantic"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS51gaze through each of the many windows ofhis hastily rigged control tower.

One of the captives, ablack man, was recovering consciousness.Raising himself up, he opened his eyes tostare, horror-stricken, at the booted foot ofa secret policeman as it swung at him, tocatch him square on the jaw.And he collapsed.Several other landing fields on Earthwere similarly occupied.One, near Mount Shasta, was unloadingin haste, as their cargoes were groggilycoming to.The little girl still clutched her doll.Dazed, she struggled awake and sat up.A secret policeman jerked her to herfeet and gave her a shove. So directed, shebegan to follow her companion victims upthe sharply increasing slope of the volcano.Mt. Etna, Mt. Fuji.

His questionswere cut short as he was cuffed viciouslyback.The survivors of the Ninth Army wereunloaded at the base of Mount Washington.Hands behind their backs, uniforms inshreds, they held their heads as proudly asthey could as they marched up the slope.A drummer boy, once a friend ofRawl’s, stopped and turned to look backdown the incline.His drum straps hung from his shoul-der, the broken top of a drum still clingingto them.A soldier behind him was pushed for-ward.

A worried frown creasing hisbrow as he looked through the window atthe landing field. The ships under hisauthority were all sitting out there,grounded and idle. Sons of dogs! When werethey going to let us get the hell out of here?By the panel, the Renegade Chief wassnarling into a mike. ”This is Earth ControlPost Number One to Volcano Crew Seven-teen. Advise when atomic charges have beenplaced.”Tossing the mike away from him, theChief spun around to face the controller.”Damned bastards. They’re the last ones toreport atomic charges in place in the volca-noes.But the nervous Controller couldn’tcare less about that. He waved his hand atthe field. ”It’s going to take several hours toget all these ships spaceborne and out ofthis.”The Chief gave a snort of laughter.”Don’t get your pants wet. Our people willall be of Earth before we push the button.”The Controller hesitated, not too sure.He looked down at his hands fidgeting withsome crumpled up papers.Relenting, the Chief shrugged a shoul-der. ”Ah, you can tell them to refuel and getback to their planets as soon as the secretpolice are aboard and my men recovered.”Relieved, the Controller let out his pentup breath. Maybe this whoreson wasn’tsuch a whoreson after all.Leaning into the wind, the first engineerreached up a black gloved hand to rub hisgrimy face.

I’m spacebornenow.”Thankfully, the engineer put the radioaway and signalled a let’s-go to his men.An exhausted group eddied to a haltand turned to watch, bewildered, as theirpersecutors began to race downhill, leavingthem behind.Reaching the trucks in the valley, therenegades and secret police piled in anddrove off.Soon, every operational ship had leftEarth, having taken on the renegades andsecret police and blasted for home.Zel, former Chief of Secret PoliceEarth, was piloting the communicationsplane as it hovered above Earth. Too closefor his liking, but orders were orders. Hechewed his lip in trepidation.In the co-pilot’s seat, the Chief was onthe air to Chi. ”No trouble. The secret po-lice have been evacuated. My renegadesalso. Been some mobs and riots amongst theplanetary population, but what the hell.”Chi’s visage on the screen was replacedby another’s as Xenu shoved him aside.”Are you ready?” asked Xenu.The Chief gave him a lazy salute. ”Oh,yes.”An anticipatory gleam leapt intoXenu’s eyes. ”Turn one of your cameras onit.”Nodding, the Chief yelled back to atechnician. ”Get two or three cameras on it,different depths.”"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS53The Chief turned back to the video andnodded again.Xenu passed his tongue over dry,cracked lips. ”You can proceed whenready.” With that, he shut down the circuit.Moving into a more comfortable posi-tion, the Chief grunted. ”What some peoplewill do for power!”Zel gave him a sideways glance. ”In-cluding you.”The Chief flinched a little then grinnedwickedly, presenting Zel with the full bene-fit of his yellowed teeth. ”You’re talking!”Meanwhile, on the face of Earth, hun-dreds of thousands of hungry, hopelesspeople sat bemused on the slopes wherethey had been left.The dispirited and ravaged Ninth Armysoldiers were too dejected to move. Onlyone of them was attempting to free hishands of their binding.And the little girl was down on herknees, rocking her doll. Bruised and dirty,tears coursed silently down her face.She looked upward at the sky, sawnothing there.Hugging her doll closer, she began towhimper, not understanding where she was,or why.The Chief lightly held the electronicbox. Its red lights glowed softly, hypnoti-cally.Face expressionless, he moved his righthand toward the box. Finger poised, he hesi-tated only a moment, then smoothly, grace-fully even, he depressed the center button.Simultaneously, the planted chargeserupted.Atomic blasts ballooned from the cra-ters of Loa, Vesuvius, Shasta, Washington,Fujiyama, Etna, and many, many others.Arching higher and higher, up and out-wards, towering clouds mushroomed, shotthrough with flashes of flame, waste andfission.Great winds raced tumultuously acrossthe face of Earth, spreading tales of destruc-tion.Debris-studded, and sickly yellow, theatomic clouds followed close on the heels ofthe winds. Their bowshaped fronts en-croached inexorably upon forest, city andmankind, they delivered their gifts of deathand radiation.A skyscraper, tall and arrow-straight,bent over to form a question mark to thevery idea of humanity before crumbling intothe screaming city below.People standing, racked by the hurri-canes, on a street looked up horrified at adescending atomic cloud. Making a futileattempt at escape, they were dropped intheir tracks, exterminated like so many pes-tilent flies.Molten lava poured, chaotic, down vol-canic slopes, obliterating all trace of thepeople that had been huddled there.A mountainous tidal wave engulfed aonce thriving seaport, leaving only a few ofthe taller building tops showing over theswirling waters. A second wave formed,preparing to finish what the first had leftundone.Areas of rioting vegetation and forestbecame barren plains, inhabited only nowby the screaming winds.The fair jewel, Earth, had been brutallymurdered.Casually, the Chief still held the elec-tronic box. His craft rocked a little, as ifechoing the passing violence below.Through the windshield, he lookeddown at Earth, its cloud formations now areddish, uneven swirl.Also observing this view, by way of adozen screens propped up around his of-fice, was Xenu.He tapped his fingers in time with thesoft, gentle symphony his office stereo wasplaying and took a delighted sip of his long,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS54cool drink.It was over.The charred remains of the little girl’sdoll bobbed on a choppy sea, lamented onlyby a low, moaning breeze.CHAPTER FIFTEENAn orchestra was playing loud, fool-ishly gay music. The hall was all decoratedfor a party.Chattering and laughing throngs milledaround the room. A few degraded, half-naked women were hanging on the arms ofthe top leaders of state, also there.Off in a secluded corner, Chi has hishead together with the banker Chu.”So you are sure I will get all mymoney back?” the banker asked, nervouslytwisting the diamond rings on his sausagefingers.”With interest, with interest, ” repliedChi. ”In addition to the Confederate Bureauof Investigation I am forming an income taxpolice in Treasury.” He made a wringingmotion with his hands, as if wringing outtowel. ”And they’ll extract every last pos-sible penny from the populace.”Chu cheered up for a moment, thenturned doubtful again. ”This cost is a terri-ble lot of money.”Chi rolled his eyes in some exaspera-tion. How could a banker be so stupid?”Master Chu, the people are a bottomlesspit for taxes. It can go on forever. A bot-tomless pit.”Sniffing superiorly, he favored thebanker with an arch look. ”Providing ofcourse you back it up with a heavilymanned police force – with a secret policeand Treasury police, and of course psychia-trists to take care of any people who ob-ject.”Chuckling, he gave Chu a reassuring paton his chubby back. ”Police states never gobroke. The populace maybe, but not us, notus.”Slightly mollified, but not convinced,the banker giggled in reply.Across the hall, an orderly placed a sil-ver tray on a table occupied by Xenu andsome of his top men.Zel reached out and took the bottlefrom the tray. He popped the cork and be-gan pouring the amber liquid into glasses.”I’d say, ” said he, pompously, ”it was suc-cessful beyond any possible hopes I had.Our men in charge of the government onevery planet, planetary armies still obedientto us, no large bases left to bother us... ” –his hand slipped, spilling a quantity of li-queur, ”... and no Congress to bother us.”They raised their crystal goblets, aquavitae twinkling, in a toast.At that moment a tiny, shrill sound be-came audible above the music and socialbuzzing. Like a diving plane, the noiseswelled a trifle.Curious, but not too concerned, Chiand his piggy friend ceased their talk andlooked upward, listening.Renegade men in the hall also lookedup, listening. As alert professionals, vigilantat all times, they grew perturbed at the ris-ing whine.Zel lowered his goblet uncertainly andstared at the ceiling. Xenu started too, hisglass dribbling as it tilted, unnoticed, in hisrigid hand.Rising to an almost unbearable pitch,the sound’ reverberated across the room.Then, with a thunderous crash, a spear-likeobject burst through the ceiling to bury itsarrowhead into the wooden floor.The note of the bomber’s engineschanged abruptly as it revved and pulledout of its dive. The canister, poised erectthere on the dance floor, began to vibrate.But few, if any, of the crowd noticed this.Galvanized into action the instant the cyl-"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS55inder had hit the floor, they were alreadysurging – men yelling, women screaming –from the confines of the room, each intenton being the first out.A more courageous renegade racedacross to the object. Grasping it, he yankedit loose. ’’It’s not a bomb, ”he shouted, ex-amining it. ”The force field above the palacewould have detonated it if it was. It’s amessage tube.”He removed the screw-cap top andbrought out a scroll and a piece of paper.Taking the scroll first, he read it out to thesmall group who had gathered around, curi-ous.” ‘Proclamation. The Congress of theLoyal Officers of the People hereby de-poses Xenu as Supreme Ruler... ’ What thebloody blastick is this?” The renegadeglanced briefly up at Xenu who’s face wasgoing ominously black, then continued toread the scroll. ” ’... and orders him to sur-render for MASS MURDER.’ What the...? It’s signed by Mish and Rawl!”Fingers fumbling, he grasped the secondsheet of paper. Voice growing hoarse, heread that, too, aloud. ” ’Xenu, copies of thisproclamation are being dropped on streetsof every planet. I advise you to surrenderpeacefully... ’ Hey, what’s this nut Rawlthink he’s doing?”Horrified, the renegade gaped aroundwildly, as if expecting Rawl to leap outfrom somewhere and shoot him down.”He’s dead. Every Loyal Officer is dead!”The assembly began to mutter. Xenustalked over to Chi in a cold fury. Grabbingthe latter’s coat lapels, he yanked them hardand spat into his face. ”How many Inter-ceptor Bases did you leave untouched?” Heyanked again.Chi, nearly choking, his body turnedinto a lump of quivering jelly, could onlystammer. ”O-only... only Mish. Th... therewas a sh... ship seen leaving the Earth b...base as it bl... blew up.” He made a franticattempt to lose Xenu’s hands. ”O-onlythose.”Releasing his Minister, Xenu burst intolaughter. Still laughing, he turned to face thestartled crowd and held his hands up in acalming reassuring gesture.”Purest bluff, ” he announced. ”Twomen against millions of secret police, againstseventy-five totally secured planets, againstall our planes and armies!”Taking the papers from the limp grip ofthe renegade, he laughed again, then began torip the papers to shreds. ”Well, good luckto them.” he finished sarcastically, droppingthe strips to the floor with exaggerated con-tempt.His audience let out a sigh of relief,then they also broke into laughter.CHAPTER SIXTEENVery alone, very small against the vastreaches of the Galaxy, a single Interceptorhung suspended. In its fuselage, four peoplewere in various stages of getting into spacegarments. Oxygen masks and parachuteswere to hand, ready to be donned.Rawl paused and looked up. ”youdon’t have to do this, Lady Min. You’vealready done enough – we’d never haveknown what this was all about withoutyou.”She kept right on getting dressed, hersoft mouth set into a line of determinationas she pulled a safe-seal suit over her khakioutfit.Ap, already dressed for space andscared stiff of the action ahead, stared atLady Min. If only she wasn’t going, then hewouldn’t have to go either. Oh lord!Continuing to buckle his parachutestraps, Rawl smiled approvingly. Heglanced out through a port. ”Well, here it is.We’re over Alpha Centauri Planet Two,"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS56Cronjin. It’s the least populated and a longway from Home Planet.” He laughed deri-sively. ”The idiots took out all the Galacticbases including this one so there’s nochance of being bombed – they’ve got nobombers we can’t handle. We’re going toparachute in on the night side while our pi-lot flies cover.”Finishing the last buckle, he reached outand took a rifle from a wall peg. ”Keep to-gether, ” he instructed, checking the blas-ter’s load, ”guide in on me closely.”Up to the aisle, the pilot called back toMish. ”About thirty-five seconds to tar-get.”Mish gave the pilot a thumbs-up sign.”When we’re gone, keep alert to cover us. Ifwe make it, we’ll radio you where to land.”He stepped forward into the airlock, wavingan arm for the rest to follow.Rawl sealed the door behind them andglanced at the safety board. The red lighthad turned green. He opened the outer doorand spun off into space.Ap was the last to jump. Hanging backat the threshold, he stared down in awe-struck horror. With much misgiving, hesqueezed his eyes shut, pulled himself to-gether, and stepped out.The four landed in rapid succession onthe spaceport pavement. In the distance, amass of lights denoted a city. To their im-mediate left, a building bristled with anten-nae and red beacons – the CommunicationsCenter for the planet.Rawl ripped open his harness buckleand, unslinging his rifle as he went, made adash towards the building. Reaching thestairs, he took them two at a time. He washalfway up them before Mish started upbehind him.Inside, a secret policeman was floppeddown in a chair reading a girlie magazine.Hearing footsteps coming up the stairs,he jumped to his feet and spun around. Hishand dived for his gun, but too late. Beforehe could even draw it, a green ribbon offlame cut into him. He staggered, eyes wide,and crumpled to the floor.Rawl propped his rifle up against thewall and, eyes rapidly studying the console,began removing his space suit.Behind him, Mish had stopped in thedoorway, rifle held ready, standing sentinelover the staircase. Breathless from the run,Lady Min and Ap brushed past Mish andentered the room.Typically female, Lady Min produceda compact mirror and fluffed out her hair.Critically appraising her reflection, she gotout her lipstick.Having seen the dead secret policeman,Ap was in no mood for seeing to his ownappearance. He eyed the body queasily, anddecided to put it out of sight and mind.Holding his heaving stomach in check,he picked up the dead man’s feet anddragged him off into a corner.Meanwhile, Rawl had completed theremoval of his space garments. Pulling hiscap from his pocket, he put it on andmoved over to the panel board. Namingthem as he went, he threw a number of lev-ers. ”Planetary News Media, home televi-sion interrupt, Planetary Army Headquar-ters, radio emergency interrupt, all PlanetAlert System, theater screens... ”The circuits clicked and whirred as theywent open. A regiment of TV monitorscreens leapt to life with Rawl’s image.Making a conscious effort to calm him-self, he drew a deep breath. He was on theair. Putting a cubical mike into position, hecommenced speaking. ”People of Cronjin, Iam Rawl, Speaker of the Congress of LoyalOfficers of the People, the ruling body ofthe Galactic Confederation... ”Lounging in a downtown bar, the Cron-jin Secret Police General visibly jumpedwhen Rawl appeared on the TV behind the"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS57counter. Slamming down his drink, heedlessof the slopping alcohol, he snatched a port-able radio from his coat pocket.”... Xenu has been deposed, ” contin-ued Rawl’s voice from the TV, ’’the secretpolice disbanded. Xenu is being sought fortrial for the destruction of the Planet Earth,murder of populations... ”The Secret Police General barked intohis radio. ”All police! Go to Cronjin Plane-tary Communications Center, airfield. Atonce!” Casting a last venomous glare at theTV, he swung about and stalked from thebarroom.A couple of teenagers were watchingwhat they called the boob-tube. The pro-grams had been so boring lately, nothing butlectures and ”dramas” of militaristic nature.Half-dozing, they jerked awake when Rawlcame on. One of them beckoned urgentlyfor the rest of his friends and family tocome over to the screen. Clustered aroundthe set, they listened avidly to their long-term hero.”Many of your own people were re-cently rounded up. They were transportedto Earth and murdered there by atomic fire.You have been told that recent measureswere taken to combat a crime wave. Thatcrime wave was Xenu!... ”Flanked by his staff officers, hastilysummoned and still buttoning on their blueand white jackets, the Commanding Generalof the Cronjin Planetary Army stoodtensely watching his office TV set. Rawl’swords were filling the room.”In addition to the entire population ofPlanet Earth, Xenu also rounded up and hadmurdered the entire Ninth Army because itsought to carry out the lawful orders ofCongress and resisted the formation of apolice state... ”The Commanding General’s face hard-ened as he nodded grimly. He knew it. ”Sothat’s why they don’t answer up, ” he mut-tered to himself. He turned and shouted’’Orderly! ”An orderly came running up. The staffOfficers began pulling transceivers fromtheir belts and leapt into action as theirCommanding General issued a stream ofdecisive orders.On a sidewalk, a crowd had gathered.Staring up at a public address systemspeaker, they were intent on what Rawlwas saying.”Your own bomber base did not blowup because of terrorists as you weretold..Xenu blew it up and every other Ga-lactic base in an effort to destroy the powerof the Loyal Officers and Congress. You aresafe, therefore, from any retaliation fromHome Planet. The sky above you is guardedby us... ”The crowd in the street shifted, angry.”... by the authority of the Congress ltherefore call on you to rise, smash the se-cret police and restore lawful government tothis planet!”At Rawl’s last words, the crowd surgedforward, snarling. One of them, ordinarily apeaceful citizen but now a ferocious mobleader inflamed by what he had heard,leaped up onto a balustrade and beganshouting directions.Listening to the wailing sirens, Mishbraced himself against the door. A fleet ofsecret police cars were coming, hurtlingacross the airfield.Rawl glanced out the window. Curtlysignalling Ap over to him, he spoke againinto the mike. ”You can and must win!”Shoving the mike into Ap’s resistivehands, Rawl grabbed his rifle, dashedthrough the door and along the outside plat-form. He dropped down to use the parapetfor cover and raised his gun over the edge.Shivering uncontrollably, Ap tried togather his scattered wits. All he wanted tobe was a thousand miles away. Steeling"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS58himself bravely, he stepped into the path ofthe television scanner and raised the mike.”Ladies and gentlemen, people of Cronjin,you have just heard an emergency an-nouncement by Commander Rawl... ”Outside, the first of the armored carshad skidded to a halt, and secret policemenwere leaping out. Rawl aimed and fired...,Ap jumped as the blast echoed through theroom.Desperately telling himself that he wasperfectly safe, and that he was, after all, apublicity agent and so should be able to dosomething as simple as talk on the radio, heforced himself to continue. ”... Loyal Offi-cer, Speaker of Congress. And if you’regoing do do anything, ” he swallowed agulp, ”you better do it now and fast. Thesecret police are piling into this airfield likean avalanche... ”The burst of flame from Rawl’s rifle hitthe car. Chock-full of ammunition, the vehi-cle was a deadly weapon.This same attribute was also its onlyAchilles’ heel. It detonated in a scintillatingflash of white and scarlet. Caught flat-footed, its crew went up with the car.Jerking his head down, Ap wailed.”People of Cronjin, where are you? Weneed help!”The second of the cars pulled up short.Jumping out, the Secret Police General sur-veyed the scene. Hell! One unit lost al-ready. He about-faced and started directingthe arriving forces into combat positions.Ap stole a glance out the window andturned sickly pale. He could count two,five – no, ten trucks! And all unloading se-cret police. ”Future zero!”A flatbed truck with a mounted artil-lery piece, joined the crowd. Its gun crewstarted training the gun on the dome of theCenter.The Secret Police General elbowed hisway through his rushing men and jumpedup onto the flatbed. ”No, no!” He wasshouting, motioning for the men to desist.”Don’t destroy the Communications Cen-ter. We’ll need it in a few minutes to tell thepopulation they are dead and we are in con-trol!”He sprang off the truck and ran to di-rect a small arms attack. At his command,lines of secret policemen threw themselvesdown and commenced discharging arcs offlame towards the Center.Lying prone over the doorsill, enemyfire chewing the frame above him, Mish re-turned his own staccato shots of fire.Ducked down, Lady Min crawled overto where Ap valiantly continued his addressto the populace. ”This field, ” he was say-ing, ”is swarming with secret police.” Heclosed his eyes and muttered a short prayer.”Right now we’re going to find out if thepeople of Cronjin are friends of murderersand oppressors!”As he spoke, two vanloads of renegadeforces arrived. By far more deadly than thesecret police. Scrambling out, the renegadeshit the ground at dead runs and made for thestaircase leading to the control room.Noticing Lady Min’s frantic gestures,he gave in to her plea. ”And so I give youLady Min, eyewitness to the planning ofXenu and destruction of Earth.” And hethankfully handed her the mike.The first of the renegades were pound-ing up the stairs. Mish, ready for it, letthem come to within a few feet of him be-fore cutting loose with his blast gun. Theleading renegades fell back, smashing intothe ones behind, creating a confused tangleof falling and thrashing men.Lady Min glanced back at the door.Spotlights! Composing herself, she turnedback to the mike. ”People of Cronjin, thismay be your last chance to attain freedom,’’ she began, close to tears. Dear God –where were the people of Cronjin?"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS59Rawl cursed as his gun clicked emptily.He thrust the last charge he had into thebreech and resumed firing. If the cavalrydon’t come soon, they wouldn’t stand achance. Not a damned chance. He shouldnever have let Lady Min come either. Grit-ting his teeth he smashed down anotherrenegade with a sharp burst of flare.By the flatbed, the determined SecretPolice General looked on through slittedeyes. Hearing a throbbing from behind, hewhirled around. Seeing nothing, he hit aswitch on the truck’s side and a spotlightstabbed out into the dark.The General froze in shock as the lightrevealed four blue and white army tanksrumbling towards him, gun snouts depress-ing into firing positions as they came.Fanned out behind the tanks, a flock ofcarrier trucks were pulling up, soldierspouring over their sides.A ragged battle cry reached the Gen-eral’s ears. ”Remember the Ninth Army!Remember the Ninth Army!”Stationed in a tank turret, the Com-manding General of the Cronjin PlanetaryArmy glared at the secret police maneuversahead. His face set into harsh lines, hisvoice severe, he snapped an order into aradio unit. ”Fire low so as not to hit theCommunications Center. Attack at once!”Together, the tanks fired huge spraysof blue-white flame.A secret police car, hit, leaped into theair. A group of trucks vanished as such, be-coming blazing pyres instead. The flatbedtruck burst asunder.As yet unaware of the ravages behindthem, the front lines of secret policemenstill exchanged shot with the Center. Then,a few seemed to sense that all was not well.As they rose to turn back, a wave of sol-diers hit them, screaming ”Remember theNinth Army!”Hearing the stepped up turmoil out-side, Lady Min risked a peek over the win-dowsill. Seeing the change of circumstances,she jumped to her feet, face radiant. Thankthe stars! ”Victory!” she cried. ”People ofCronjin, you are free, free, free!”Rawl and Mish grinned at each other.Dangling their rifles, they went to stand bythe shredded door to greet the approachingArmy General and his officers.Catching sight of Rawl, the Army Gen-eral rushed forward and firmly shook hishand. ”So I finally get to meet the famousRawl!”Mish gestured, ”Shall we go inside?”They did so, Ap clearing some batteredchairs out of their way.Lady Min had stopped speaking andheld the mike toward the conferring group,volume up.A sudden commotion at the door madethem turn. A group of officers with ashackled civilian in their midst crowded in.One of the officers gently pushed thecivilian forward. ”Look what we have here!”The man was middle-aged, he held hishead up proudly as another officer tried outvarious keys on his shackled wrists. Theofficer who had spoken explained further,noting Rawl’ s raised eyebrow. ”We got himout of the police barracks’ dungeon. TheCivil Governor of Cronjin!”One of his hands successfully un-shackled, the Governor extended it to Rawl.Shaking his hand, Rawl studied theman, liking what he saw. ”Can I count onyou and the General here to get this planetmopped up and in order?”The Governor and Army Generalbeamed with enthusiasm. ”Indeed so!” theychorused.Mish and Ap had gone over to the con-sole behind Lady Min. Looking as if hewere about to faint, Ap collapsed againstthe panel and wiped his face on his sleeve.”That was tombstone close!”"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS60Mish shrugged. ”One down and sev-enty-four planets to go.”Ap was horrified. ”Seventy-four morelike these?”CHAPTER SEVENTEENThrough the Interceptor’s windscreen,the stars seemed like a chain of diamondsagainst a backdrop of black velvet.In the pilot seat, mike in hand, Rawlbroadcasted a rallying message.”People of the Galactic Confederation,fight on! We have wrested thirty planetsfrom the unlawful control of Xenu. Every-where populations are in revolt. The meas-ures of personal income tax, enforced identi-fication, illegal entries and violations of pri-vacy by the secret police have inflamedpeoples everywhere.”Xenu in his stronghold on HomePlanet receives little news to cheer him... ”And revolt they did.Anchar: The Personal Income Tax Bu-reau headquarters was particularly hated.

Consulting it wasRawl himself, Mish, Lady Min and Ap.Rawl slapped down his pencil andstretched his cramped limbs. ”Sooner orlater they will get their wits working andstart to use the Home Planet bombers toretaliate.”Intent on oiling his pistol, Mish noddedabsently. He’d discussed this with Rawllast night.Ap darted his gaze from Rawl to Mish,then back to Rawl again. Bombers! Whatthis meant he didn’t know, but it must bebad news."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS61”I propose to attack that base, ” Rawltapped an area of Home Planet on the chart,”and then move right on in on the HomePlanet without waiting for other planets.They’re doing all right.”Mish nodded again. ”Looks safest.”Ap gasped. Had he heard that right?”Safest?”Rawl smiled. ”This is an outer spaceatomic Interceptor, ” he explained patiently,”made to combat enemy space battleships.Using it in an atmosphere makes it deadeasy against planetary ships. I doubt ifthere are any renegades that can even flyone.”Ap was unconvinced. ”Like a tigerfighting a puppy, huh?”Rawl laughed. ”You can man the tailgun.”Clutching at the table, Ap moaned, ”Doyou have any heart medicine aboard?”A young girl was being shoved aroundlike a rag doll. The renegades, seated in acircle, laughed at her terror, pushing herfrom one to the next of them with herclothes tearing further at each jolt.In the background, the Home Planetbomber base’s fleet of ships sat idle andpoorly cared for. For sure, the renegadeswho manned the base had better things todo, like what they were doing now.One of the renegades loosened up hiscollar. ”I didn’t think it would be so muchfun to be an agent of the Confederate Bu-reau of Investigation.”Another man gave a leer and turned tothe girl. ”Come on, sweetheart, let’s investi-gate further.”The girl was tossed at him. He caughther and ripped a garment further. She fell tohis feet, inert, eyes wide open.He shook her a little. No movement.”Hell! She’s dead!”A renegade to his left reached out.”Good, hand her over, that’s the way I like’em.”One of the group had grown bored. Hegot to his feet and yawned. ”I better get asquadron airborne to relieve the HomePlanet patrol.” He began to slouch off.The renegade holding the girl pitchedher into the arms of the renegade to his left,and called out after the departing man,”Yeah, you do that.”And he returned his attention to thesport.Up in patrol, the renegade co-pilotpunched a transmit button. ”When are youdog lovers coming up to relieve us?”The radio uttered an uncouthness in re-ply.Starting to put the mike back on itshook, a blip on the radar caught the co-pilot’s eye.He cast a searching glance out throughthe windscreen and yelped in fright.He frantically shook the dozing pilot’sarm and pointed outside, bringing the mikeback to his mouth with his other hand. Hisvoice cracked as he practically squeaked: ”ALoyal Officer Interceptor!”Rawl threw his Interceptor into a dive.Between his craft and the base below, sixrenegade patrol ships were flying in sloppyformation.Back in the tail, Ap sat in the gunnerseat wrestling the gun with clumsy hands.Looking out through his viewport, heflinched. ”Six Interceptors!”Alarm sirens sounded at ground level.Aroused from their various and nefariousactivities, renegades scrambled toward theirstations.Holding the dive, Rawl signalled Mishto hold fire as the latter readied a firing con-trol. Mish shot a grin back, and nodded.Ap checked the port again. ”Six moretaking off!” He began muttering a prayer,hoping that somewhere some kind godwould listen and transport him instantly to"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS62some other place. Anywhere but here!Firing tracer shot, the patrol rose tomeet Rawl’s ship.Flashing downwards to pass rightthrough the enemy formation, Mish closedthe firing control just as his own shippassed the first of the renegade Intercep-tors, leaving behind a pattern of black ballsstrewn between the patrol ships.Then, the black balls exploded, knock-ing four of the renegade craft from the skies.Ap at his tail gun was intent on mop-ping up the remaining two. Firing wildly, hemanaged to score a direct hit on one ofthem. Belching greasy black smoke, it fell.Letting loose a whoop of delight, Apturned his blazing gun, prayers forgotten,on the last ship as it pivoted around andbegan to fire at him.A curtain of swirling red engulfed Ap’sturret. In the cockpit, Rawl swore andjerked at the controls to steady his Inter-ceptor.But the hit was only glancing, not,much damage done. Ap, a trifle singed,yelled triumphantly as his next shot caughthis opponent right on the nose.Rawl held the dive. Mish pointed downat six more ships shooting vertically up to-wards them. ”Second squadron!Being twice the speed as well as twicethe size of the renegade craft, Rawl ’s shiphad flashed by them before they could evenchange course to fire on him.Nearly grazing the ground, Rawl pulledout of the dive and took the Interceptor,engines shrieking, up and under the patrol.Shooting right through the squadron,Mish again closed the firing switch, and thesix ships were blasted to fragments.Rawl yanked at the controls and dovedownwards again, for the base itself. In thetail Ap was raring to go, ready to roll.Hunting for something to fire at, he foundnothing, and slumped back in disappoint-ment.An anti-spacecraft gunner crew concen-trated ribbons of shot at the plummetingInterceptor. No use – the ship just keptdiving toward them. They ceased fire andducked futilely for cover.Mish once more had his hand on thefiring control, waiting for the word...”Now!” yelled Rawl, and Mishsnapped his thumb down.Rawl banked his ship and sped forsafety as the base went up in a cloud ofatomic particles.Flying left-handed, Rawl cruised his In-terceptor above Home Planet. He held amike in his other hand, and frowned slightlyas he spoke. ”Calling Commanding GeneralArn, Commanding Planetary Army HomePlanet. Calling Commanding General Arn,Commanding Planetary Army HomePlanet... ”A voice spluttered in over the receiver.”I’ll get him, I’ll get him.”Having answered the call, a communica-tions clerk signalled urgently to the Com-manding General across the room. Heducked down to avoid a red slash of firethat laced above him. Many others in theroom did the same, for the Planetary armywas engaged in a pitched battle.Soldiers, in the blue and white uni-forms, were at the windows, firing intermit-tently at the enemy outside. A line ofwounded lay against the far wall, growinglonger by the minute.General Arn, a dignified, grey-headedman, answered the clerk’ s summons. Capoff and collar open he ran, keeping his headdown, over to the radio.The clerk handed Arn the mike, shakinghis head incredulously. ”It sounds likeRawl!”The clerk hit a video button and theGeneral stared, jaw agape, at the screen.”Rawl!”"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS63He drew a breath of relief, then spokevery seriously. ”Don’t try to come in here.We’re pinned down! They seized our tanks.Secret police and renegades are out there inthousands all around our base.””Are you at Central Base Three?”The General looked a little suspicious.The guy would have to be crazy to come inhere! With reservation, he answered ”Yes.”Rawl gave a short laugh. ”Keep theheads of your men down when you hear aship!””Rawl... ” the General began, to be si-lenced by the audible click as Rawl cut thecircuit.Looking around him in some amaze-ment, he spoke to no one in particular.”He’s coming in here!” Then, hastily but-toning his collar and jamming his cap on hishead, heturned and shouted to his men. ”In-crease your fire!”High above Central Base Three, Rawland Mish surveyed the scene below. Thebase was a fortress-like building surroundedon three sides by open parade ground andbacked on the fourth by a winding river.Some twenty tanks were ranged around thebuilding, spouting gushes of flame. Massesof secret police in battle formations werekeeping up continuous fire at the buildingwhere army soldiers at the windows onlyshot back sporadically.Rawl pulled a lever and his shipswooped downward. ”Use fire, ” he toldMish. ”Don’t hit the building.”Mish grinned back at Rawl and gavehim an OK sign.Zel, a bit removed from his men, wasseated in a camp chair, observing the battlein satisfaction. Just a few more hours, andhe’d probably get a medal or something.Deserved it too – no one would ever knowthat this really wasn’t his plan, but whatthe hell. He was the senior officer hereanyway.The note of an alien engine intrudedupon his ruminations. He looked up, con-sternated and dumbfounded to see a divingInterceptor. Jumping up, he ran for thecover of some nearby trees.As the ship’s shadow raced over thetanks and men on the parade grounds, Mishjerked on the firing control, letting loose ablanket of raging flame.Army soldiers crowded, wounded andall, to the windows, cheering as the tanksblew up one by one.Those still alive in the ranks of secretpolice nearest the army building had about-faced to stare, awe-struck, at the burningwreckage. They didn’t see as the soldiersleapt over their window embrasures tocharge headlong at them.Then, hearing the battle cry ”Rememberthe Ninth Army!” the secret police whirledaround to be knocked flat by the wave ofblue and white uniformed men.”Remember the Ninth Army!”In the Interceptor, Lady Min and Aphad come to stand behind the pilot seats inthe Cockpit, looking eagerly through thewindshield.Ap clutched Mish’s arm and howled indelight. ”We’ve won!”Laughing, Mish disengaged Ap’s handsand reached across to lightly punch Rawl’sshoulder. ”Hey, pardner. We’ve done itagain!”Seeking an avenue of release for his highspirits, Ap grabbed Lady Min and waltzedher down the fuselage, to her own and theothers’ amusement.But below, Zel was making good hisescape. He clambered into an armored carand kicked it into gear. Hatless andscorched, he careened off madly, intent onlyon getting away."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS64CHAPTER NINETEENThe heads of state were holed up in thepalace. Renegade troops, scattered strategi-cally around the walls, kept up a barrage ofsmall arms fire.Out in the street, a crowd of affrontedcivilians were held back by barricades andpanes of anti-shot glass.In the square, facing the palace, wereseveral armored vehicles and a blue andwhite tank. Next to the tank, General Arn,Mish and Rawl were conferring.”They’re in there all right, ” observedArn. ”The lot of them, like rats in a hole.”Mish slammed a fist against the tank’sside. Blast! He spoke gruffly in his frustra-tion. ”You can’t bomb the place. It’s forcescreen detonates anything you drop onthem.”Rawl leaned back on the tank andshook his head. ”No, no. We’ve got to takethem alive.” He beckoned to a civilian policecaptain who held a loud-hailer.Stooping low to avoid ricocheting shot,the captain ran over to the tank, trailing thehailer’s cord behind him.Rawl jabbed a thumb over his shoulder.”Isn’t there any way we can get them out ofthere?”The captain shrugged. ”We could stormthe place. Cost an awful lot of men.””Call them again, ” sighed Rawl. ”Wewant to take them alive.”A man in the forefront of the watchingcrowds turned to his neighbor, marveling atwhat he had just heard. ”Rawl just said theywant to take them alive!”Pleased with the idea, his eyes lit upfanatically. Cupping his hands to hismouth, he shouted to Rawl: ”Take themalive!”Those around the man stared at him,astonished. Then they too took up the cry.”Take them alive!” the din grew asmore and more joined in.The captain glanced back at the peoplebehind the barricades, a small smile crossinghis face. Turning again to confront the pal-ace, he switched on the hailer. ”You arecalled upon to surrender peacefully. Allrenegades in the palace will be granted am-nesty and transported out of the Galaxy.All officials will be arraigned for trial. Comeout without weapons and your hands aboveyour head.”In a window, a renegade was turningthe captain’s words over in his mind. Helistened for a moment to the mob’s chant-ing – ”Take them alive!”Sighing, he worked the slide of his rifleand pulled the trigger. It gave an emptyclick. He regarded the street again, thenwithdrew from the window in defeat.One of the palace doors opened a crack.Several blast rifles slithered out to clatterdown the broad front steps. The dooropened wider, and a ragged bunch of pow-der-burned renegades straggled out, handsheld high.An officer signalled to his blue andwhite uniformed men. ”Hold your fire!”The men who had capitulated werefrisked and loaded into an open-sided truck.Suddenly, a burst of fire from the pal-ace knocked three of the renegades down.A civilian police officer dropped to hisknees and raised his rifle to shoot back.Holding his smoking rifle, the secretpolice executive tarried a second too long atthe window before drawing back. The de-moniac snarl on his face changed to one ofagony as the shot from below caught him inthe abdomen. Loosing an involuntary burstfrom his gun, he pitched forward and fell tothe pavement below.Viewing this exchange, Rawl’s frowndeepened. He looked over at Arn; ”Still a lotof fanatics in there.”Arn, scowling at the palace, nodded ab-sently."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS65Rawl drew his pistol and checked itsload. Jerking his head towards Mish, hemoved off in the direction of the palace.”Come on, Mish.”Aroused from his meditations, Arnmade a grab at Rawl in alarm; ”No!”But they were off, crouching low.Creeping alongside of them was a driverlessarmored car, pushed by a couple of civilianpolice, to protect them from fire. A splatterof red glanced off the top of the car withoutdoing harm.Deciding the least he could do was keepthe enemy busy, Arn shouted to his men:’’All troops, rapid fire at palace windows!”Pulled up in front of the building’sarched portals, Rawl and Mish knelt in backof the car’s fenders. Keeping his eyes onMish’s face, Rawl drew a coin from hispocket and flipped it.”Heads, ” chose Mish.Rawl didn’t even look at the coin orshow it to Mish. ”I lost, ” he stated, cuttingshort Mish’s protests by sprinting off to-wards the palace steps. Red streaks offlame ripped at the cement around him, butstill he ran on.Mish swore. Seeing someone about toshoot at Rawl from a window, he rapidlyaimed and fired. The man’s gun, hit, ex-ploded in his hands.Mish turned anxiously back to watchRawl dart through the palace doors. Hell!He wasn’t going to let Rawl go in therealone! He upped and dashed off to catch upwith Rawl.Inside, Rawl paused to spray the hallwith shot. Spotting a shadowy figure on abalcony, he brought his gun to bear andfired.He started as someone raced past himand made for the stairs. Seeing it was Mish,he smiled – not surprised. Staying below tocover him, Rawl waited until Mish hadreached the head of the staircase beforedashing up them himself.Their backs to the hallway on the leftof the bannister, neither saw an office doorsurreptitiously open. Nor did they see agrey-green uniformed man sneak out andtake aim.The shot caught Mish on the side of hishead. A look of amazement on his face, hejerked once and, weapon flying into the air,he fell backwards rolling over and over as hetoppled down the stairs.Rawl’s face went white as stunned, hewatched Mish fall. Then, whirling around,he saw a door down the corridor bang shut.Running furiously towards it, he cutloose a blast of fire and the door buckledinward. Kicking the smoking door aside, heentered the room, gun held ready. He swepthis eyes across the room. Cowering by thedesk were two secret policemen. A thirdwas getting to his feet, having been knockeddown by the door, and was bringing his riflearound.Though Rawl was still in shock fromthe loss of Mish, his reflexes were lightningquick. Instinctively almost, he blasted theman with the rifle down and turned hisblazing gun on the other two men. And hekept on firing long after the secret police-men were dead.He checked himself, the fury clearingfrom his mind. Stepping out into the hall-way, he looked down over the bannister atthe crumpled form lying at the bottom ofthe stairs.For a moment only he allowed grief totear through him. Mish had been his bestfriend. Damn, damn, damn! Then, grimlydetermined, he moved down the corridor.In the street, Lady Min had joinedGeneral Arn by the tank. Her face whitewith strain, she stared at the palace, clasp-ing and unclasping her hands in nervoustension. Oh lord! Let him come out alive...Bootbeats echoing, Rawl strode down"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS66the hall. He passed door after door until hearrived at the last one, slightly more orna-mental than the rest, its plaque announced itto be Xenu’s office.He reached out his hand, tentativelytouched the doorknob. he turned it. Then,he savagely kicked the door open andlunged through.At first glance, the room seemed bare.Red velvet drapes hung askew, red carpetlittered with paper and discarded weapons,the massive black desk was smothered inscatters of files.Rawl took this all in in a flash, thenbrought his gaze to rest on the floor underthe window. There slumped down, werefive men. Rawl walked slowly, cautiouslyeven, towards them.Stopping before them, Rawl regardedthe five men with contempt. Zel was white-faced with fear; Chi was panting – his handraised to ward off imagined horrors; Sty laystiffly as if he were one of his own patients,or victims rather; Chu the banker would notmeet Rawl’s eyes, concentrating as he wason not vomiting from total shattering terror;and lastly, Xenu – he was slightly morecomposed than the rest.Rawl’s lip curled. Well here they were.The kingpins. Not so brave now, butweren’t all criminals basically cowards atheart?Praying Rawl wouldn’t notice, Xenuobliquely eyed the floor by his right hand.A blast pistol lay there invitingly. He crepthis hand toward it, keeping a close watch onRawl as he frisked down the other four.Closer and closer crept Xenu’s hand.Still Rawl hadn’t noticed...With a sudden movement, Xenugrabbed the pistol. Out of the corner of hiseye, Rawl saw this and spun around,swinging his foot at the same time.Jamming the gun against his right tem-ple, Xenu squeezed the trigger...Just as Rawl’s boot connected with hishand, sending the pistol spinning up intothe air, it discharged harmlessly.Scooping it up from where it bouncedback onto the floor, Rawl tossed the pistolto the far end of the room.His attempted suicide foiled, and allweapons removed from his vicinity, Xenuflopped down in despair. ’Whoresons! Hewas lost, lost, lost.Casting a withering glance at Xenu,Rawl moved over to the window and shat-tered the glass with his pistol butt.Reversing his gun so as to keep hisprisoners covered, Rawl leaned out thewindow and waved his cap to the peoplebelow. ”They’re alive!”The crowd roared in approval. LadyMin, tears of relief streaming down her oth-erwise glowingly beautiful face, waved backfrantically, trying to catch Rawl’s eye.Car horns and church bells joined in theuproar. Rejoicing spread through the city atthe news of victory. As one, the crowdsburst through the barricades and surged,yelling in jubilation, towards the palace.The joy of the moment was infectious.Rawl smiled to himself as he Looked downat the tumult below. Seeing Lady Min there,his grin widened and he blew her a kiss.CHAPTER TWENTYGeneral Arn was talking with Rawl inhis office. Nearby, flashy in his loud newclothes, Ap was fidgeting. Lady Min, beau-tifully groomed and poised, gazed adoringlyup at Rawl through long lashes.Rawl put a hand on the General’s arm.”There’s a lot to be done. Can you nomi-nate some of your people as Loyal Offi-cers?””Yes, ” the General affirmed. ”And if Iwere you I would take the two top classesof the Loyal Officer Academy, commission"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS67them at once and put them up for electionby the people.”Rawl nodded, then a frown marked hisface. ”It won’t, ” he added gloomily, ”be thesame operating without Mish.”As he spoke, the door flew open andMish, heavily bandaged and grinning madly,entered on crutches. ”That, ” he laughed, ”isone problem you won’t have to feed intothe computer!”Rawl looked as if he was seeing an ap-parition. Mish? Alive? Recovering from theinitial shock, he whooped in delight andrushed over to clap him on his good arm.”You’ll never know, pardner, ” he said,”how pleased I am to see you!”Lady Min and Ap also swooped downon Mish trying to hug him and be careful ofhis wounds at the same time.”Hey, watch it!” exclaimed Mish inmock protest.The Congressional Hall echoed as theblack-robed judge, seated in the place onceoccupied by Xenu, rapped his gave!Two other judges flanked him. Manymore were seated below him in a long tier.The vast rows of chairs were empty,save those occupied by a stern-faced Rawl,a black-veiled Lady Min and a bandagedMish.Heavily guarded, Xenu, Chi, Zel, Styand Chu faced their tribune, awaiting sen-tence.Broadcasting the trial, a newsman andan audio assistant rolled the TV cameraaround on its crane support.The chief judge looked down gravely onthe criminals before him. ”Having been dulyand carefully tried under the authority ofCongress, the following persons are foundguilty of attempting to form a police state,extorting personal taxes, of instigating re-volt, high treason against the state, willfuland malicious mass murder of populationsand the destruction of the people and allthings on planet Earth:”Zel – former Chief of Secret PoliceEarth, Sty head of the Psychiatric Associa-tions, Chi – former head of the Departmentof Justice, Chu – former head of the Galac-tic Bank, and Xenu – deposed SupremeRuler... ”The judge paused for breath, then con-tinued, his voice taking on an even moresomber tone. ”... are hereby sentenced to beexhibited on every planet to the popula-tions of each planet and then imprisoned ina mountain sustained for eons by life-supports.”Such is the judgement of this court, ofthe Congress, of the offended peoples ofthe great Confederation and the moral na-tures of all decent men.”Is there anything the felons would careto say?”His question was met by silence. Thebanker’s nervous giggle didn’t count.The Judge, with some asperity, rappedhis gavel to silence the banker. He frownedseverely. ”Such is the fate of those whowould form a police state and such it hasever been.”He rapped his gavel three more times tosignal the conclusion of the proceedings.The sentence was carried out meticu-lously.The criminals were displayed in glassencased locomotives that travelled the faceof every planet in the Confederation.At each station, the trains would halt,met by angry, indignant crowds. Among thebands of citizens were some more bold thanthe rest. These displayed their hatred andutter contempt for the felons with tangibleexpressions in the form of eggs, tomatoesand other such objects, pelted pell-mell atthe carriages.The prisoners reacted in various ways.Chi merely stared out the windows, eyeswide and vacant as he slowly went insane."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS68Sty took to muttering Freudian stylephrases to himself in an attempt to occupyhimself with things other than his horror ofthe fate in store for him. Chu lost a greatdeal of weight, becoming less piggy, but stillmaintaining his habit of twist-twisting hisrings. Zel became a manic-depressive, andindulged in paroxysms of deep melancholiafollowed by fits of glee.And Xenu – Xenu just sat and sagged,head in his hands.Their grand tour over at last, they weretaken to a solitary mountain that broodedover a barren plain.A cluster of blue and white trucks wereparked around a tunnel entrance that ledinto the heart of the mountain. Nearby, amilling crowd of civilians and soldiers werescattered about. A military band playedfuneralistic music, slow in beat and low inpitch.Accompanied by his TV and radiobroadcasting equipment, a newsman waskeeping up a steady commentary. ”We arestanding here on the desolate slopes ofMount Xenu on Planet Tawn. This is themountain named for him in the days of un-holy power when he planned his criminalcourse of destruction. It was designated,possibly with bitterness, as the final placeof imprisonment. Officers of the Court arecompleting... ”Inside the mountain was a grotto carvedout of the living stone. A blue-overalledelectrician was connecting up sheets ofcopper plating that lined the room. Alertguards stood about. Cables and wires lay inheaps on the copper sheathed floor. Severalwhite-coated doctors and their attendantsworked busily around a semicircle of hospi-tal-style tables on which the prisoners,strapped down, were lying.Xenu was staring dully upwards as onedoctor fastened tubes to his wrists and an-other fastened them to his ankles. The firstdoctor, having finished the wrists, began toput two prongs around Xenu’s throat.Wetting his dry, cracked lips, Xenulooked up at the doctor, some terror show-ing in his glazed eyes. ”These devices keepone alive forever?””Don’t talk, ” snapped the doctor.A guard stepped forward. ”Don’t talkto the prisoner!”Despairing, Xenu rolled his eyes. ”Howlong is forever?”No one answered, no one knew.Completing their tasks, the doctors be-gan to pull out. Guards moved away fromthe tables. They filed out one by one, leav-ing only the electrician and one guard incompany with the prisoners.Rapidly, the remaining two gave the ta-bles and wirings a final check. The prisonerslay inert but awake. The banker and psy-chiatrist stared wretchedly at the exit, smalland more desirable than life, at the end ofthe long tunnel. Zel started to laugh hysteri-cally. Chi looked around, vacant-eyed. AndXenu gazed blankly, torment-torn, at theceiling.Satisfied all was in order, the electricianand guard also began to depart. Swinging thecopper-grated door shut behind them, theywalked the length of the tunnel.Reaching the final exit, the electricianswitched the lights off, and the guardsbanged the heavy steel door shut.Inside, the prisoners were bathed indarkness. And the screaming began...The newscaster buttonholed the electri-cian. ”How long, ” he asked, thrusting themike forward, ”will the power last to con-tinue their life-supports?”Turning in some impatience, the electri-cian shrugged. ”About seventy-four millionyears, I think, possibly more. Longenough.”Piqued at this laconic reply, the news-caster looked around for another prospec-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS69tive interviewee.Bulldozers moved up and began shov-eling dirt to cover up the tunnel entrance.An engineering officer spoke to one of thedrivers. ”Make sure there’s no trace of thattunnel entrance.”The driver grinned and gave him a sa-lute.Finally, the people had drifted away,the band was gone.Mount Xenu once more stood alone.No sign left of the tunnel. No sign of any-thing.A sullen breeze moaned monotonouslyover the plain, tumbling a few dried weedsbefore it.A faint scream sounded. Perhaps asudden gust of air, perhaps...Just the lonely wind.CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEEarth. A murky yellow mist swirledabout some shattered tree stumps thatspotted a promontory.A white helicopter was hovering thereas it lowered an angular, cylindrical object.It was a large capsule, shiny green in color.Its surface was smooth but for the panelsset in its nose.A few people were standing on thepromontory. All wore anti-radiation suitsover their normal clothing; Mish, watchingthe lowering capsule, guided it down withhand signals.Ap, not doing anything much as usualbut there anyway, looked around at thedesolated landscape. He found it a little bitspooky. ”This sure is, ” he commented tothe air as no one was listening to him, ”theend of Planet Earth! Future zero!”Off to one side, Lady Min and Rawlhad their heads together, talking quietly.Lady Min looked up at Rawl a trifleuncertainly. ”I never was his mistress, thatwas just his idea of a way to becomepopular. He hated women.”Rawl smiled, a little surprised butpleased all the same.”I used to keep news clips of you, ”she went on as she lowered her gaze, embar-rassed. ”Kept them under my pillow when Iwas a teenager. Silly, huh?”Rawl’s eyes flew wide open. ”Youkept clips of me?” It was his turn to lookembarrassed. ”I used to keep photos of youin my wallet.”They looked at each other in suddenunderstanding. Their hands reached out andtouched.Meanwhile, the capsule grounded, thehelicopter had landed. Mish disengaged thecable and together with Ap, wrestled thecylinder into position.Unhooking one of the panels, Mishswitched on a camera unit and recorder. Heturned to signal Rawl. ”You’re on, ” hehissed.Gently, Rawl took his hand from LadyMin’s and softly touched a finger to hermouth. Her eyes were brilliant as she smiledat him.Stepping into line with the capsule’scamera lens, Rawl braced himself to speak.”A few of us labored together to make thiscapsule so that those who may follow willknow how your planet was murdered andwhy.”He swept his arm to indicate the devas-tated terrain.”This desolation was the result offorming a police state. When populationsare restless, unwise governments seek tooppress. And the more they oppress thecloser they bring a revolution. Foolish gov-ernments seek to prevent revolution withmore oppression. And they die.”But part of the fault for this must beshared by the Congress. Congress let anexecutive branch grow bigger and bigger and"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS70let it act to antagonize and alienate the peo-ple. To that degree Congress betrayed thepeople who elected and trusted them.”He looked down and raised a hand totick off a finger as he made each point. ”Be-fore the other planets are also destroyed,Congress has got to reform the school sys-tem so -they stop teaching kids they areanimals. Then it has to get the police to re-alize they are responsible for public safety,not just nabbing people they don’t like.Congress will have to pass a bill abolishingthe whole evil fraud of psychiatry. Con-gress has to eradicate the executive branchas it is and organize one with far lesspower.”Rawl gazed intensely into the cameralens, as if willing a result of duplication andaction to occur if, when, Earth ever was re-born, re-civilized.”Do not attempt to form another policestate for then your planet will die again.”The mistakes of the past were ours.The future is yours.”With that, Rawl essayed an easy salute.A stray wind blew a wisp of yellowfog between Rawl and the capsule and thescreen went blank.EPILOGUEStunned, the president and his head copcould only stare at the blank screen as thecapsule’s panel doors slowly swung shut.Through the window, the sun was set-ting on Washington the fair, Washington thebeautiful.And still they just sat. The head of Na-tional Police vacant-eyed; the presidentpensive, trying to gather his scattered wits.The president considered the conse-quences of this capsule’s contents becamepublic knowledge. He shuddered at the idea.All his plans, all his power... he shook hishead to disband such awful notions.After a time, he stood up. Seeing hisboss rise, Jedgar also got to his feet, thank-ful to get going. He knew this business wasterribly important, and that much was atstake – but all he could think of was hisdinner and the race tonight. And he had amighty big bone to pick with that Bennythe Dip...Thoughtfully, the president walkedtowards the locked doors that led from theroom, Jedgar trailing behind, anxious to begone.On the steps outside the science build-ing, a cluster of newsmen and photogra-phers had gathered. They had been waitingan awfully long time.As the huge portals opened, their des-ultory talk ceased abruptly. They lookedup expectantly as the president and hissidekick, czar of all US police, appeared tobe instantly hit by a barrage of clamorousquestions and popping flashbulbs.”What was it?” yelled a reporter.”Mr. President... ” began another.And another reporter ”Was it some an-cient civilization?”Loud and clear above the others, onereporter could be heard. ”Was it a time cap-sule?”The president looked down at the re-porters. They were obviously awaitingsome kind of answer. Well, he’d give ’emone. He smiled slowly, eyes veiling.Waving his hands for silence, he spokein a jocular tone of voice. ”Sorry to disap-point. It was just a piece of old World WarII junk. Just scrap metal, gentlemen. Justscrap metal.”Turning his head a little, the presidentexchanged a sly, conspiratorial glance withhis Chief of National Police.Jedgar, catching on and approvingwhole-heartedly, smiled back – a bit evilly,slightly twisted.No one would ever know..."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"REVOLT IN THE STARS71Just scrap metal.THE END"}]
