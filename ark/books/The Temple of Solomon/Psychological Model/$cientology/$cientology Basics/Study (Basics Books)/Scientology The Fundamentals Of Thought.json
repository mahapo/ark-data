It isan extension of DIANETICS which is in itself an extension of old-time faculty-psychology of400 years ago. More acceptable and normal psychology such as that begun by St. ThomasAquinas and extended by many later authors was, in 1879, interrupted severely by oneProfessor Wundt, a Marxist at Leipzig University in Germany. This man conceived that manwas an animal without soul and based all of his work on the principle that there was no“psyche” (a Greek word meaning “spirit”).Psychology, the study of the spirit (or mind) then came into the peculiar position ofbeing “a study of the spirit which denied the spirit”. For the subsequent decades, Wundtian“psychology” was taught broadly throughout the world. It taught that man was an animal. Ittaught that man could not be bettered. It taught that intelligence never changed. This subject,Wundtian psychology, became standard, mainly because of the indifference or lack ofknowledge of people in charge of universities.Scientology is actually a new but very basic psychology in the most exact meaning ofthe word. It can and does change behavior and intelligence, and it can and does assist people tostudy life. Unlike Wundtianpseudo-psychology, it has no political aspiration. Scientology isnot teaching dialectical materialism under the heading of “psychology”.The term SCIENTOLOGY is taken from the Latin word SCIO (knowing in the fullestmeaning of the word) and the Greekword LOGOS (study).Scientology, used by the trained and untrained person, improves the health,intelligence, ability, behavior, skill and appearance of people.It is a precise and exact science, designed for an age of exact sciences.It is employed by an AUDITOR (a Scientology practitioner) upon individuals or smallor large groups of people in their presence. The Auditor makes these people, at their choice, dovarious exercises, and these exercises (processes) bring about changes for the better inintelligence, behavior and general competence. It is employed as well by persons in businessand government to solve problems and to establish better organization.It is also employed by the average person to bring better order into life.How is Scientology Used ?Scientology is employed by an Auditor (one who listens and commands) as a set ofdrills (exercises, processes) upon the individual, and small or large groups. It is also employedas an educational (teaching) subject. It has been found that persons can be processed (drilled) inScientology with Scientology exercises and can be freed from their major anxieties and canbecome brighter, more alert and more competent. BUT if they are only processed they have atendency to be overwhelmed or startled, and although they may be brighter and more competentthey are still held down by an ignorance of life. Therefore it is far better to teach AND process(audit, drill) a person than only to process him. In other words, the best use of Scientology isthrough processing and education in Scientology. In this way there is no imbalance. It isinteresting that people only need to study Scientology to have some small rise in their ownintelligence, behavior and competence. The study itself is therapeutic (goodmedicine) by actualtesting.1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It is also used by business and government leaders to establish or improve organization.It is used as well by the individual at home or at his work to make a better life.Is Scientology Valid ?Tens of thousands of case histories (reports on persons who have been processed,individual records) all sworn to (attested before public officials), are in the possession of theorganizations of Scientology. No other subject on earth except physics and chemistry has hadsuch gruelling testing (proofs, exact findings). Scientology in the hands of an expert (Auditor)can restore man’s ability to handle any and all of his problems. Scientology is used by some ofthe largest companies (business organizations) on Earth. It is valid. It has been tested. It is theonly thoroughly tested system of improving human relations, intelligence and character, and isthe only one which does.Where is there more information about Scientology?The world headquarters for Scientology is the Hubbard College of Scientology, SaintHill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex, England. In addition, there are major Scientologyorganizations on practically every continent on earth. Scientology practitioners are validated(certified, given diplomas) by these organizations. Diplomas are given only after very exacttraining. A person who is skilled in Scientology procedures has a diploma from one of theseorganizations. A list of these organizations is provided at the back of this book. These officesand these people can give you more information about Scientology. There have also been manybooks published in English, as well as other languages, on the subject of Dianetics andScientology. The publisher of the book you are reading may have more books in yourlanguage.Can a Person without much Study use Scientology?Scientology is practiced in daily life by enormous numbers of people who have noformal training in the humanities beyond a study of textbooks. Scientology was developed tobe used by such people as well as by the trained practitioner. A person studying by himselffrom textbooks can use Scientology to help his fellow human beings.What Special Use Does Scientology Have?Scientology does things for people where nothing has been done before. It restorespeople’s ability to handle conditions which were once considered hopeless. It increases theirintelligence. It changes their competence and betters their behavior. In addition to these it bringsthem a better understanding of life.Who Invented Scientology ?Scientology was discovered (found), not invented (created). It was organized by L.Ron Hubbard, an American, who has many degrees and is very skilled by reason of study.Hubbard was trained in nuclear physics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., before he started his studies about the mind. This explains the mathematical precision ofScientology. L. Ron Hubbard has been given many honors for his work in the field of themind. He has been assisted by one of the largest organizations, numerically speaking, in thefield of the mind on Earth today, the organizations of Dianetics and Scientology.EDITOR’S NOTE2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOBASIC PRINCIPLESLike engineering, Scientology has certain basic principles. These are necessary to a fullunderstanding of the subject. It is not enough to know how to process (drill) people inScientology. To be effective (good) one must also know the basic principles. Scientology isvery exact. The humanities (human studies) of the past were full of opinions. Scientology isfull of facts that work.To study Scientology one should scan (skim) quickly through the basics and findsomething with which one can agree. Having found ONE THING (one fact) with which he canagree, one should then skim through again and find another fact. One should continue to dothis until he feels some friendliness to the subject. When one has achieved this, and only whenone has achieved this, he should then study all the basic principles. There is no effort here to beauthoritarian (opinionated). No one will try to make the subject difficult.You may have been taught that the mind (thought, the brain) is a very difficult thing toknow about. This is the first principle of Scientology: It is possible to know about the mind,the spirit and Life.The Cycle of ActionThe most fundamental idea in Scientology is called the CYCLE OF ACTION. CYCLE= a span of time with a beginning and an end = a section of the totality of time with a beginningand an end = in beginningless and endless time one can set out periods which do have abeginning and an end insofar as action is concerned. ACTION = motion or movement = an act= a consideration that motion has occurred.In very ancient books it is written that from chaos came birth, from birth there wasgrowth, when growth was achieved there was then a gradual decay, the decay then ended indeath. After death there was chaos.Scientology expresses this more briefly. THE CYCLE OF ACTION IS ANAPPARENCY AS FOLLOWS: CREATE, then SURVIVE, then DESTROY; or Creation,Survival, Destruction. First there is Creation. Then this is followed by Survival. Then this isfollowed by Destruction.APPARENCY = appears to be, as distinct from what actually IS.This cycle is only an APPARENCY. It is what we see, what we behold, what webelieve. We CONSIDER (think, believe, suppose, postulate) that it is so and then we see it so.A child is born, he grows, he reaches manhood, he grows old, he dies. In Scientologyit can be seen that none of these steps are necessary. One considers them so, and so they are“true”. A man can grow old quickly or slowly. He grows old to the degree that he believes heis growing old. Because everyone AGREES that this is the way things are, they go that way.The cycle is not TRUE. It is only APPARENT. It is APPARENT because we believe we see it.It is APPARENT because we AGREE that it should be so.The test of this principle is as follows: By using the CYCLE OF ACTION can we makeanyone well or more intelligent? Thousands of tests have proven that the use of and belief in theCYCLE OF ACTION has made none well or intelligent. Therefore, no matter if we see it, theremust be something wrong with it. The woman, growing old, wishing to appear younger, isprotesting this CYCLE OF ACTION. She feels there is something wrong with it. There is. Wehave to find out what the ACTUAL cycle is before we can make people better.3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ACTUAL = what is really true = that which exists despite all apparencies = thatwhich-underlies the way things seem to be = the way things really are.THE ACTUAL CYCLE OF ACTION is as follows: CREATE, create-create-create,create-counter-create, no creation, nothingness.CREATE = make, manufacture, construct, postulate, bring into beingness = CREATE.Create-create-create = create again continuously one moment after the next =SURVIVAL.Create-counter-create = to create something against a creation = to create one thing andthen create some thing else against it = DESTROY.No creation = an absence of any creation = no creative activity.AN ACTUAL cycle of action then consists of various activities, but each and every oneof them is creative. The cycle of action contains an APPARENCY of SURVIVAL, but this isactually only a continuous creation. The APPARENT cycle of action containsDESTRUCTION, but the ACTUAL cycle of action tells us what destruction is.DESTRUCTION is one of TWO activities. DESTRUCTION is (in terms of action) a creationof something against a creation of something else. For example, a wall is seen standing. To beapparent it is necessary that the wall be constantly created. The act of “destruction” is to exertagainst the wall another creativeness, that of the action or activity of knocking the wall down.Both the wall standing there and the action of knocking it down are “creative” actions. Becausewe may object to (argue against, dislike) a wall being knocked down, we vilify (swear at,scorn) the creativeness involved in knocking it down with the word “destructive”.ACTUALITY tells us that there is no such thing as destruction. There is only creation against acreation. There is another “type of destruction” and this is NO MORE CREATION. By nolonger being a party to (a member of) the wall’s creation, the wall, in theory, can cease to existfor one. This is true in ACTUAL PRACTICE in Scientology.REALITY is the way things appear. REALITY IS APPARENCY. To do anythingabout reality, one must search into and discover what underlies the APPARENCY. Of whatdoes REALITY consist (what is Reality composed of)? We SEE an APPARENCY which hasthe CYCLE OF ACTION OF CREATE-SURVIVEDESTROY. More basically (fundamentally)this CYCLE OF ACTION contains nothing but CREATION.If one stops making something completely and ceases to be a party to its manufacture, itno longer exists for one. If one ceases to create, there is nothingness. When one createssomething or beholds something which is created, that thing is still being created. Even if oneis creating something with his left hand and has forgotten about it with his right hand, the thingstill exists. In other words, one can create something without knowing it is still being created.Then one seeks to DESTROY it by a counter-creation (a creation against it). The result is achaos created by two opposing creations.LET US BE PRACTICAL. A science is not a science unless it is practical. A theory isno good unless it works. All the fancy and beautiful theory in the world is useless unless it hasa use or a workability. Is this CYCLE OF ACTION THEORY USEFUL? It is. So long as webelieve that we have to destroy with force in order to destroy at all, as long as we think in termsof destruction, we have chaos.There is CREATING AND KNOWING ONE IS CREATING. There is CREATINGAND NOT KNOWING ONE IS CREATING. When one drives a car or a cart he does manythings (performs many acts) which he is not AWARE OF (conscious of, knows about), andthese we call AUTOMATIC ACTIONS. One is doing something and is not aware that he isdoing it. One starts to create something, then places this thought still active beyond his ownreach and the creation continues to occur.4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"KNOWINGLY CREATING SOMETHING is always the first condition. One can thenpurposefully CONTINUE THE CREATION UNKNOWINGLY. Everything one is doingknowingly or unknowingly one is doing here and now, in the present instant, in present time.ONE KNOWINGLY STARTED ANY CREATION in some PAST moment. But the Creationis being done in the present moment.To stop any creation it can be established that one once knew one was creating it—finding that thought and making it known again—OR ONE CAN SIMPLY CREATE NEWLYAND CONSCIOUSLY WHAT ONE IS ALREADY CREATING UNCONSCIOUSLY (un-knowingly). In either case the creation stops. The WRONG WAY is to start a new creation tocounter against the old creation; when one does this he gets confusion and chaos.FOR EXAMPLE, a man has a bad leg. He is trying to “get well”. He seeks then tocreate a good leg. He goes to doctors and wants to be healed. The treatment is difficult andusually somewhat unsuccessful in the case of a very severely crippled leg. SOMETHING iscreating a bad leg. Against this he is creating a good leg. The result is confusion and a bad leg.BUT a THIRD creativeness is present. First something was creating, we hope, a good leg.Then a counter-creation (such as an accident to his leg) counter-created a bad leg. Now he istrying to counter-create again a good leg. The result is to wipe out the ORIGINAL GOOD LEGsince THAT IS THE CREATION HE IS TAKING OVER AND EXPOSING WITH HISEFFORTS TO GET WELL. He wants a good leg. The trouble with him is the countercreationof a bad leg. The test is factual. Have him create (by a certain Scientology process) bad legsuntil the counter-creation of bad legs is wiped out and the ORIGINAL CREATION OF AGOOD LEG WILL REAPPEAR. This only fails when there is no original creation of a goodleg, when the original creation of a good leg is gone.FOR EXAMPLE, a man has a job. He works at it. That is to say hecreate-create-creates a job throughout the days, weeks and years. As long as he makes a job,the job exists. One day he DEPENDS upon (takes for granted) this job. He no longer creates it.It ceases to exist. He has no job. The APPARENCY is that he loafed (became lazy) and wasdischarged. The ACTUALITY is that he no longer created a job and so didn’t have one.FOR EXAMPLE, a man depends upon a woman to keep his house for him. One day heno longer has a woman. He can’t keep house EVEN THOUGH BEFORE HE MARRIED THEWOMAN HE COULD KEEP HOUSE .FOR EXAMPLE, a man is sane. He gets the idea (creates the idea) that it would bebetter to be insane. He starts to go insane (having created it) and then does numberless things inorder to stay sane. Here he was already creating the state of sanity. He counter-created insanity.He then counter-created sanity against insanity.CREATION IN THIS WORK may be thought to exclude God. We are hereconsidering only those things which man or man as a spirit can make or manufacture or think.The subject of WHO or WHAT is doing the creation does not invalidate the cycle. This is awork on the subject of the mind, not a work on the subject of the Supreme Being.LYING is the lowest order of creativity.There are many tests for these principles in SCIENTOLOGY. Such tests come underthe heading of PROCESSING .5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREETHE CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCEThere are three conditions (circumstances, qualities) of existence (apparency, reality,livingness).These three conditions comprise (make up, constitute) life.They are BE, DO and HAVE.THE CONDITION OF BEING iS defined as the assumption (choosing) of a categoryof identity. It could be said to be the role in a game and an example of beingness could be one’sown name. Another example would be one’s profession. Another example would be one’sphysical characteristics. Each or all of these things could be called one’s beingness. Beingnessis assumed by oneself or given to one’s self, or is attained. For example, in the playing of agame each player has his own beingness.THE SECOND CONDITION OF EXISTENCE IS DOING. By doing we mean action,function, accomplishment, the attainment of goals, the fulfilling of purpose, or any change ofposition in space.THE THIRD CONDITION IS HAVINGNESS. By havingness we mean owning,possessing, being capable of commanding, positioning, taking charge of objects, energies orspaces.The essential definition of having is to be able to touch or permeate or to direct thedisposition of.The game of life demands that one assume a beingness in order to accomplish adoingness in the direction of havingness.These three conditions are given in an order of seniority (importance) where life isconcerned. The ability to be is more important than the ability to do. The ability to do is moreimportant than the ability to have. In most people all three conditions are sufficiently confused(chaotic, baffling) that they are best understood in reverse order. When one has clarified(brought order into) the idea of possession or havingness, one can then proceed to clarifydoingness for general activity, and when this is done one understands beingness or identity.It is an essential to a successful existence that each of these three conditions be clarifiedand understood. The ability to assume or to grant (give, allow) beingness is probably thehighest of human virtues. It is even more important to be able to permit (allow) other people tohave beingness than to be able oneself to assume it.Beingness = IdentityIf you ask an Auditor how these work in processing, he will tell you that there is aspecialized form of each of these conditions. The Auditing form of Beingness is Identity. Toachieve a betterment of beingness and the granting of beingness, the Auditor remedies withprocessing the scarcity of identities of the preclear. The preclear is often found in valences(other identities): his father’s or mother’s or marital partner’s or any or all of thousands ofpossible people. He is unable to achieve or obtain (he thinks) enough identity or an identity ofhis own. He decries or criticizes the identities of others (fails to grant beingness to them) .6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"He himself cannot obtain enough identity to feel he has an identity. Identity is so scarcethat it’s too valuable. Nobody must have one. To be with such a person is therefore anuncomfortable experience since he does not credit our identity—does not grant us beingness.The “cure” for this is elementary. Let us say he is obviously in father’s valence(identity). He got into father’s valence when he found he could get no attention from mother.Observing that father got some of her attention, he took father’s identity. However, let us sayhe didn’t like father. The Auditor finds him hating “himself”. “Himself” is really father.A clever Auditor (see section under Processing) would see that while he was in father’svalence, it was really mother’s attention that was sought.The Auditor does not inform his preclear of such a finding. He asks the preclear to lieabout (lowest form of creativity) identities which would attract mother’s attention. Then, whenthe preclear can do this, the Auditor would have him invent identities which would attractmother’s attention.Suddenly the preclear would be no longer in father’s valence. However, he would havebeen not only in father’s but also in mother’s valence so the same process would have to bedone on father. “Lie about,” the Auditor would say, “identities which would attract father’sattention,” then “invent one,” until the preclear had many and would no longer be in mother’svalence.Solving father and mother valences is fundamental, since most people are somewhat “inthem” or revolted from them. But people can be “stuck” in all sorts of identities, even bedpostswhen humans are too valuable to be used.The rule is that the more aperson is “stuck” in avalence or identity, the fewer heconceives to exist. And the harder he thinks it is to get attention. Thus he can becomeexhibitionistic (displaying himself too thoroughly, being too much there at all times) or he canbecome dispersed (hiding himself, being vague, not there most of the time).People err, in identity, in being too apparent or too little apparent. The remedy of eitheris the remedy of their scarcity of identity.Identity and AttentionOne “needs” an identity to play the game, as covered later, but mainly to “get attention”.A being looks at things. To balance the flow of his attention, he feels he must also belooked at. Thus he becomes attention-hungry.Unlike yellow and brown people, the white does not usually believe he can get attentionfrom matter or objects. The yellow and brown believe for the most part (and it is all a matter ofconsideration) that rocks, trees, walls, etc., can give them attention. The white man seldombelieves this and so is likely to become anxious about people. Thus the white saves people,prevents famine, flood, disease and revolution forpeople as the only purveyors of attention arescarce. The white goes further. He often believes he can get attention only from whites and thatyellow and brown peoples’ attention is worthless. Thus the yellow and brown races are notvery progressive, but, by and large, saner. And the white race is progressive but more frantic.The yellow and brown races do not understand white concern for “bad conditions” since whatare a few million dead men? There are plenty of identities and there is plenty of attention, theythink. The white can’t understand them. Nor can they understand the white.Attention and Identity form a group of two. Attention makes space. Identity closesspace.7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Attention is a method of knowing. Inattention is a method of not-knowing.Identity is a method of making known. Lack of identity is a method of makingunknown.ValencesThe whole study of valences is a fascinating one. A valence is defined as “a falseidentity assumed unwittingly”. An identity is modified by valences. People who can be nobodymay try to be everybody. People who are seeking a way out of scarcity of identity may becomefixed in false valences. Nations can become fixed in valences of countries they have conqueredin war, etc., etc.A rule is that a person assumes the identity of that which gets attention. Another rule isthat the person assumes the identity of that which makes him fail (for he gave it his attention,didn’t he?)There is a basic personality, a person’s own identity. He colors or drowns this withvalences as he loses or wins in life. He can be dug up.Do =EffectDoing can be defined as the action of creating an effect. An effect in creation is action.An Auditor, processing a preclear, would always use “effect processes” to increasedoingness.“What effect could you create on father?” would be a typical Auditor question.If a preclear is fixated by books, a machine, a tool or a person, the Auditor asks him tolie about, then invent effects he could create upon it. At first the preclear may be able to think ofnone. Then as the process is continued he may become wildly imaginative or even cruel.Further running will bring the preclear into a more comfortable frame of mind. Criminals ormaniacs are people who are frantically attempting to create an effect long after they know theycannot. They cannot then create decent effects, only violent effects. Neither can they work(do).Despair of creating an effect brings about aberration and irrational conduct. It alsobrings about laziness and carelessness.Command of attention is necessary to creating an effect. Therefore when one conceiveshe cannot easily get attention, he seeks to create stronger effects. He creates effects to getattention. He gets attention to create effects.As in Axiom 10 (given later), the creation of an effect is the highest purpose in thisuniverse. Thus when one cannot create effects, he has no purpose. And thus it works out inLife. It may be all right to be a stern and unrelenting superior or parent, but such create lazinessand criminals. If one cannot have an effect created upon one. (and one is known to another),very definitely harmful results will ensue.As one believes he creates the least effect upon unconscious or dead people, these, as inhospitals or China, become the subject of much aberrated activity. “What effect could youcreate on an unconscious person (or a dead person)?” asked over and over by an Auditorobtains some astonishing results.An artist stops his work when he believes he can no longer create an effect.8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"A person actually dies for lack of being able to create an effect.BUT security often depends on being able to create no effect.The whole subject of survival is bound up in no-effect. Obviously those things onwhich no-effect can be made, survive.If one is anxious about survival (a foolish thing, for he can’t do anything else) hebecomes anxious to have about him things which resist all effects. But as his only anxiety isabout the survival of a valence or identity, remedy of the scarcity of these can resolve thematter.Another cycle of action, containing also the classes of effects, isSTART-CHANGE-and-STOP. This is the definition of control.HavingnessAs there must be a playing field (see Chapter Twelve) for a game to be held, so theremust be havingness. One must be able to possess.There are millions of methods of possession in life. The obvious one becomesoverlooked. If one can see a thing he can have it—if he thinks he can.The degree to which one can live is the degree to which one can own. To own is not tolabel or cart away. To own is to be able to see or touch or occupy.One loses to the degree he is forbidden to have. But to play a game one must be able tobelieve he can’t have.Effect and HaveEffect and Have form a pair like Attention and Identity. An effect should be on oragainst something. Thus havingness. If one’s attention never meets anything he doesn’t alwayslike it. Thus he wants objects.Effect makes distance. Have shortens distance.ProblemsMan or any life form in this universe seems to love problems. A problem is moreimportant than freedom. Problems keep up interest. When a man has a problem verythoroughly and can’t solve it, he really has too few problems. He needs more.The insanity among the idle is a matter of problem scarcity.A problem is defined as two or more purposes in opposition. Or Intention versusIntention.Out of the conditions of existence above can come many complex problems.If a man had all the attention in the world he would be unhappy. If he had all theidentities possible, he would still be unhappy. If he could blow up Earth or create any otherhuge effect he wanted without limit, he would be miserable (or insane). If he could owneverything everywhere he would be dulled to apathy. Or so it seems. For these conditions of9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"existence are all subordinate to the need of problems, by current Scientology reasoning andresults.Thus to have a person lie about problems or invent problems of the same size as theones he has, or the valences he is in, or to invent data of the same or different size as the one heis fixed upon is to make a well man.Probably the problem is the antidote to unconsciousness. It is certainly the antidote forboredom. But in making up the problems of life he consults the conditions of existence: Be,Do, Have and their necessary partner in every case, Attention.10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTHE EIGHT DYNAMICSAs one looks out across the confusion which is life or existence to most people, one candiscover eight main divisions, to each of which apply the conditions of existence. Each divisioncontains a cycle of action.There could be said to be eight urges (drives, impulses) in life. These we callDYNAMICS. These are motives or motivations. We call them THE EIGHT DYNAMICS.There is no thought or statement here that any one of these eight dynamics is moreimportant than the others. While they are categories (divisions) of the broad game of life theyare not necessarily equal to each other. It will be found amongst individuals that each personstresses one of the dynamics more than the others, or may stress a combination of dynamics asmore important-than other combinations.The purpose in setting forth this division is to increase an understanding of life byplacing it in compartments. Having subdivided existence in this fashion, each compartment canbe inspected as itself and by itself in its relationship to the other compartments of life. Inworking a puzzle it is necessary to first take pieces of similar color or character and place themin groups. In studying a subject it is necessary to proceed in an orderly fashion. To promotethis orderliness it is necessary to assume for our purposes these eight arbitrary compartments oflife.THE FIRST DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence as one’s self. Here we haveindividuality expressed fully. This can be called the SELF DYNAMIC.THE SECOND DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence as a sexual or bisexualactivity. This dynamic actually has two divisions. Second Dynamic (a) is the sexual act itselfand the Second Dynamic (b) is the family unit, including the rearing of children. This can becalled the SEX DYNAMIC.THE THIRD DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence in groups of individuals. Anygroup or part of an entire class could be considered to be a part of the Third Dynamic. Theschool, the society, the town, the nation are each part of the Third Dynamic, and each one is aThird Dynamic. This can be called the GROUP DYNAMIC.THE FOURTH DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence as mankind. Whereas thewhite race would be considered a Third Dynamic, all the races would be considered the FourthDynamic. This can be called the MANKIND DYNAMIC.THE FIFTH DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence of the animal kingdom. Thisincludes all living things whether vegetable or animal. The fish in the sea, the beasts of thefield, or of the forest, grass, trees, flowers or anything directly and intimately motivated bylife. This can be called the ANIMAL DYNAMIC.THE SIXTH DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence as the physical universe. Thephysical universe is composed of matter, energy, space and time. In Scientology we take thefirst letter of each of these words and coin a word, MESS. This can be called the UNIVERSEDYNAMIC.THE SEVENTH DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence as or of spirits. Anythingspiritual, with or without identity, would come under the heading of the Seventh Dynamic.This can be called the SPIRITUAL DYNAMIC.11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE EIGHTH DYNAMIC—is the urge toward existence as Infinity. This is alsoidentified as the Supreme Being. It is carefully observed here that the science of Scientologydoes not intrude into the Dynamic of the Supreme Being. This is called the Eighth Dynamicbecause the symbol of infinity stood upright makes the numeral “8”. This can be called theINFINITY or GOD DYNAMIC.Scientologists usually call these by number.The earlier science Dianetics included Dynamics One to Four. Scientology embracesDynamics One through Seven as known territory, scientifically demonstrated and classified.The difficulty of stating the exact definitions of the dynamics is entirely verbal.Originally the dynamics read “the urge toward survival as—”. As the science developed itbecame apparent that survival was only an apparency and only one facet of existence. Both thecycle of action and the three conditions of existence belong in each dynamic.A further manifestation of these dynamics is that they could best be represented as aseries of concentric circles wherein the First Dynamic would be the center and each newDynamic would be successively a circle outside it. The idea of space adjoining enters into theseDynamics.The basic characteristic of the individual includes his ability to so expand into the otherdynamics, but when the Seventh Dynamic is reached in its entirety one will only then discoverthe true First Dynamic.As an example of use of these Dynamics one discovers that a baby at birth is notperceptive beyond the First Dynamic, but as the child grows and interests extend can be seen toembrace other dynamics. As a further example of use, a person who is incapable of operatingon the Third Dynamic is incapable at once of being a part of a team and so might be said to beincapable of a social existence.As a further comment upon the Eight Dynamics, no one of these Dynamics from One toSeven is more important than any other one of them in terms of orienting the individual. Whilethe dynamics are not of equal importance, one to the next, the ability of an individual to assumethe beingness, doingness and havingness of each dynamic is an index of his ability to live.The Eight Dynamics are used in Scientology communication and should be perfectlylearned as part of the language of Scientology. The abilities and shortcomings of individualscan be understood by viewing their participation in the various dynamics.12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVETHE A-R-C TRIANGLEThere is a triangle of considerable importance in Scientology, and understanding of itgives a much greater understanding of life and an ability to use it.The A-R-C triangle is the keystone of living associations. This triangle is the commondenominator of all of life’s activities. The first corner of the triangle is called Affinity. The basicdefinition of affinity is the consideration of distance, whether good or bad. The most basicfunction of complete affinity would be the ability to occupy the same space as something else.The word “affinity” is here used to mean love, liking or any other emotional attitude.Affinity is conceived in Scientology to be something of many facets. Affinity is a variablequality. Affinity is here used as a word with the context “degree of liking”. Under affinity wehave the various emotional tones ranged from the highest to the lowest, and these are, in part,serenity (the highest level), enthusiasm (as we proceed downward toward the baser affinities),conservatism, boredom, antagonism, anger, covert hostility, fear, grief, apathy. This, inScientology, is called the Tone Scale. Below apathy, affinity proceeds into solidities such asmatter. Affinity is conceived to be comprised first of thought, then of emotion which containsenergy particles, and then as a solid.The second corner of the triangle is Reality. Reality could be defined as “that whichappears to be”. Reality is fundamentally agreement. What we agree to be real is real.The third corner of the triangle is Communication. In human relationships this is moreimportant than the other two corners of the triangle in understanding the composition of humanrelations in this universe. Communication is the solvent for all things. It dissolves all things.The inter-relationship of the triangle becomes apparent at once when one asks, “Haveyou ever tried to talk to an angry man?” Without a high degree of liking and without some basisof agreement there is no communication. Without communication and some basis of emotionalresponse there can be no reality. Without some basis for agreement and communication therecan be no affinity. Thus we call these three things a triangle. Unless we have two corners of atriangle, there cannot be a third corner. Desiring any corner of the triangle, one must include theother two.The triangle is conceived to be very spacious at the level of serenity and completelycondensed at the level of matter. Thus to represent a scale for use one would draw a largetriangle with a high part of the scale and succeedingly small triangles down to a dot at thebottom of the scale.Affinity, reality and communication are the basis of the Scientology Tone Scale, whichgives a prediction of human behavior as contained in Science of Survival.As has already been noted, the triangle is not an equilateral triangle. Affinity and Realityare very much less important than Communication. It might be said that the triangle begins withCommunication, which brings into existence Affinity and Reality.The most primitive Scientology definition of Communication is“Cause-Distance-Effect”. The fundamental manual of Communication is the book, Dianetics55!A-R-C are understanding.If you would continue a strong and able communication with someone there must besome basis for agreement. There must be some liking for the person and then communication13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"can exist. We can see then that simple talking and writing randomly without knowledge of thiswould not necessarily be communication. Communication is essentially something which issent and which is received. The intention to send and the intention to receive must both bepresent in some degree before an actual communication can take place. Therefore one couldhave conditions which appeared to be communications which were not.Original with Scientology, as are all these concepts, the A-R-C triangle understood is anextremely useful tool or weapon in human relationships. For instance, among the A-R-Ctriangle laws, a communication to be received must approximate the affinity level of the personto whom it is directed .As people descend the tone scale they become more and more difficult to communicatewith, and things with which they will agree become more and more solid. Thus we havefriendly discourse high on the scale and war at the bottom. Where the affinity level is hate, theagreement is solid matter, and the communications . . . bullets.14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTHE REASON WHYLife can best be understood by likening it to a game. Since we are exterior to a greatnumber of games we can regard them with a detached eye. If we were exterior to Life insteadof being involved and immersed in the living of it, it would look to us much like games look tous from our present vantage point.Despite the amount of suffering, pain, misery, sorrow and travail which can exist inlife, the reason for existence is the same reason as one has to play a game—interest, contest,activity and possession. The truth of this assertion is established by an observation of theelements of games and then applying these elements to life itself. When we do this we findnothing left wanting in the panorama of life.By game we mean contest of person against person, or team against team. When wesay games we mean such games as baseball, polo, chess or any other such pastime. It may atone time have struck you as peculiar that men would risk bodily injury in the field of play justfor the sake of “amusement”. So it might strike you as peculiar that people would go on livingor would enter into the “game of life” at the risk of all the sorrow, travail and pain just to havesomething to do. Evidently there is no greater curse than total idleness. Of course there is thatcondition where a person continues to play a game in which he is no longer interested.If you will but look about the room and check off items in which you are not interested,you will discover something remarkable. In a short time you will find that there is nothing inthe room in which you are not interested. You are interested in everything. However,disinterest itself is one of the mechanisms of play. In order to hide something it is onlynecessary to make everyone disinterested in the place where the item is hidden. Disinterest isnot an immediate result of interest which has worn out. Disinterest is a commodity in itself. It ispalpable, it exists.By studying the elements (factors) of games (contests) we find ourselves in possessionof the elements of life.Life is a game. A game consists of freedom, barriers and purposes. This is a scientificfact, not merely an observation.Freedom exists amongst barriers. A totality of barriers and a totality of freedom alikeare no-game conditions. Each is similarly cruel. Each is similarly purposeless.Great revolutionary movements fail. They promise unlimited freedom. That is the roadto failure. Only stupid visionaries chant of endless freedom. Only the afraid and the ignorantspeak of and insist upon unlimited barriers.When the relation between freedom and barriers becomes too unbalanced, anunhappiness results.“Freedom from” is all right only so long as there is a place to be free to. An endlessdesire for freedom from is a perfect trap, a fear of all things.Barriers are composed of inhibiting (limiting) ideas, space, energy, masses and time.Freedom in its entirety would be a total absence of these things—but it would also be a freedomwithout thought or action, an unhappy condition of total nothingness.Fixed on too many barriers, man yearns to be free. But launched into total freedom heis purposeless and miserable.15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"There is freedom amongst barriers. If the barriers are known and the freedoms areknown there can be life, living, happiness, a game.The restrictions of a government, or a job, give an employee his freedom. Withoutknown restrictions, an employee is a slave, doomed to the fears of uncertainty in all his actions.Executives in business and government can fail in three ways and thus bring about achaos in their department. They can:(1) seem to give endless freedom;(2)seem to give endless barriers;(3) make neither freedom nor barriers certain.Executive competence, therefore, consists of imposing and enforcing an adequatebalance between their people’s freedom and the unit’s barriers and in being precise andconsistent about those freedoms and barriers. Such an executive adding only in himselfinitiative and purpose can have a department with initiative and purpose.An employee, buying and/or insisting upon freedom only, will become a slave.Knowing the above facts he must insist upon a workable balance between freedom andbarriers.An examination of the dynamics above will demonstrate the possibility of a combinationof teams. Two group dynamics can engage one another as teams. The self dynamic can allyitself with the animal dynamic against, let us say, the universe dynamic and so have a game. Inother words, the dynamics are an outline of possible teams and interplays. As everyone isengaged in several games, an examination of the dynamics will plot and clarify for him thevarious teams he is playing on and those he is playing against. If an individual can discover thathe is only playing on the self dynamic and that he belongs to no other team it is certain that thisindividual will lose, for he has before him seven remaining dynamics. And the self dynamic isseldom capable of besting by itself all the remaining dynamics. In Scientology we call thiscondition the “only one”. Here is selfish determinism in the guise of self-determinism and hereis an individual who will most certainly be overwhelmed. To enjoy life one must be willing tobe some part of life.There is the principle in Scientology called pandeterminism. This could be looselydefined as determining the activities of two or more sides in a game simultaneously. Forinstance, a person playing chess is being selfdetermined and is playing chess against anopponent. A person who is pan-determined on the subject of chess could play both sides of theboard.A being is pan-determined about any game to which he is senior. He is self-determinedonly in a game to which he is junior. For instance, a general of an army is pan-determinedconcerning an argument between two privates or even two companies of his command. He ispan-determined in this case; but when he confronts another army, led by another general, hebecomes self-determined. The game in this wise could be said to be larger than himself. Thegame becomes even larger than this when the general seeks to play the parts of all the politicalheads which should be above him. This is the main reason why dictatorship doesn’t work. It isall but impossible for one man to be pan-determined about the entire system of games whichcomprise a nation. He starts taking sides and then to that degree becomes much less than thegovernment which he is seeking to run.It has been stylish in past ages to insist upon only freedom. The French Revolutionfurnishes an excellent example for this. In the late part of the 18th century, the nobles of Francebecame so self-determined against the remainder of the country and were so incapable of takingthe parts of the populace that the nobles were destroyed. Immediately the populace itself soughtto take over the government, and, being trained and being intensely antipathetic to any and allrestraints, their war cry became “Freedom”. They had no further restrictions of barriers. The16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"rules of government were thrown aside. Theft and brigandage took the place of economics. Thepopulace, therefore, found itself in a deeper trap and discovered itself to be involved with adictatorship which was far more restrictive than anything it had experienced before theRevolution.Although man continually uses “Freedom” for his war cry he only succeeds inestablishing further entrapment for himself. The reason for this is a very simple one. A gameconsists of freedom and barriers and purposes. When man drops the idea of restrictions orbarriers he loses at once control over barriers. He becomes self-determined about barriers andnot pan-determined, thus he cannot control the barriers. The barriers left uncontrolled trap himthen and there.The dwindling spiral of the apparency Create-Survive-Destroy comes about directlywhen man shuns barriers. If he considers all restrictions and barriers his enemies, he is ofcourse refusing to control them in any way and thus he starts his own dwindling spiral. A racewhich is educated to think in terms of freedom only is very easily entrapped. No one in thenation will take responsibility for restrictions, therefore restrictions apparently become less andless. Actually they become more and more. As these restrictions lessen, so lessens the freedomof the individual. One cannot be free from a wall unless there is a wall. Lacking any restrictionslife becomes purposeless, random, chaotic.A good manager must be capable of taking responsibility for restrictions in thatfreedom, to exist, must have barriers. A failure to take initiative on the subject of restrictions orbarriers causes them to arise all by themselves and exist without consent or direction.There are various states of mind which bring about happiness. That state of mind whichinsists only upon freedom can bring about nothing but unhappiness. It would be better todevelop a thought pattern which looked for new ways to be entrapped, and things to be trappedin, than to suffer the eventual total entrapment of dwelling upon freedom only. A man who iswilling to accept restrictions and barriers, and is not afraid of them, is free. A man who doesnothing but fight restrictions and barriers will usually be trapped. The way to have endless waris “abandon” all war.As it can be seen in any game, purposes become counter-posed. There is a matter ofpurpose-counterpurpose in almost any game played in a field with two teams. One team has theidea of reaching the goal of the other, and the other has the idea of reaching the goal of the first.Their purposes are at war, and this warring of purposes makes a game.The war of purposes gives us what we call problems. A problem consists of two ormore purposes opposed. It does not matter what problem you face or have faced, the basicanatomy of that problem is purpose-counter-purpose.In actual testing in Scientology it has been discovered that a person begins to sufferfrom problems when he does not have enough of them. There is the old saw (maxim) that ifyou want a thing done, give it to a busy man to do. Similarly if you want a happy associate,make sure that he is a man who can have lots of problems.From this we get the oddity of a high incidence of neurosis in the families of the rich.These people have verylittle to do and have very few problems. The basic problems of food, clothing andshelter are already solved for them. We would suppose, then, if it were true that an individual’shappiness depended only upon his freedom, that these people would be happy. However, theyare not happy. What brings about their unhappiness? It is the lack of problems.SELF-DETERMINISM is a condition of determining the actions of self. It is a First(Self) Dynamic action and leaves the remaining seven undetermined or, in actuality, inopposition to the self. Thus if one wants to take on the rest of life in a free-for-all fight, one17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"could be entirely insistent upon total self-determinism. As the remainder of the dynamics musthave a say in one’s self to function, they fight at once any attempt at total self-determinism.PAN-DETERMINISM means determining the action of self and others. It means widerdeterminism than self. In an aberrated fashion we see this in an effort to control all others toaggrandize (make important) self. Pandeterminism is across determinism or determinism of twosides. If one controls (monitors) both sides of a chess game one is “above” the game.One is self-determined, then, in any situation in which he is fighting. He ispan-determined in any situation which he is controlling.To become pan-determined rather than only selfdetermined, it is necessary to view bothsides.A problem is an intention-counter-intention. It is then something that has two opposingsides. By creating problems one tends to view both sides in opposition and so becomespan-determined.Thus a problem only appears to be necessary to man. The problem is the closest realityman has to pandeterminism. In processing, the invention of problems then shows a wider viewand so exteriorizes one from difficulty.Although successful processing in Scientology would depend upon taking all threeelements of games into consideration—and indeed that is the secret of bettering people: takingfreedom, barriers and purposes into consideration and balancing them—it is true that you couldmake a man well simply by sitting down with him and asking him to invent problems one afterthe other. The invention of synthetic problems would be found to free his mind and make himmore able. Of course, there is another factor involved in this in that it is he who is inventing theproblems and therefore he is becoming pan-determined about problems rather than being in oneplace with all problems opposed to him.An unhappy man is one who is considering continually how to become free. One seesthis in the clerk who is continually trying to avoid work. Although he has a great deal of leisuretime he is not enjoying any part of it. He is trying to avoid contact with people, objects,energies and spaces. He eventually becomes trapped in a sort of lethargy. If this man couldmerely change his mind and start “worrying” about how he could get more work to do, hishappiness level would increase markedly. One who is plotting continually how to get out ofthings will be miserable. One who is plotting how to get into things has a much better chance ofbecoming happy.There is, of course, the matter of being forced to play games in which one has nointerest—a war into which one is drafted is an excellent example of this. One is not interested inthe purposes of the war and yet one finds himself fighting it. Thus there must be an additionalelement, and this element is “the power of choice”.One could say, then, that life is a game and that the ability to play a game consists oftolerance for freedom and barriers and an insight into purposes, with the power of choice overparticipation.These four elements, freedom, barriers, purposes and power of choice, are the guidingelements of life. There are only two factors above these, and both of them are related to these.The first is the ability to create, with, of course, its negative, the ability to uncreate; and thesecond is the ability to make a postulate (to consider, to say a thing and have it be true). This,then, is the broad picture of life, and these elements are used in its understanding, in bringinglife into focus and in making it less confusing.18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE PARTS OF MANThe individual man is divisible (separable) into three parts (divisions) .The first of these is the spirit, called in Scientology the Thetan. The second of theseparts is the Mind . The third of these parts is the Body.Probably the greatest discovery of Scientology and its most forceful contribution to theknowledge of mankind has been the isolation, description and handling of the human spirit,accomplished in July, 1951, in Phoenix, Arizona. I established along scientific rather thanreligious or humanitarian lines that that thing which is the person, the personality, is separablefrom the body and the mind at will and without causing bodily death or mental derangement.In ages past there has been considerable controversy concerning the human spirit orsoul, and various attempts to control man have been effective in view of his almost completeignorance of his own identity. Latterly spiritualists isolated from the person what they called theastral body, and with this they were able to work for various purposes of their own. InScientology the spirit itself was separated from what the spiritualists called the astral body andthere should be no confusion between these two things. As you know that you are where youare at this moment, so you would know if you, a spirit, were detached from your mind andbody. Man had not discovered this before because, lacking the technologies of Scientology, hehad very little reality upon his detachment from his mind and body and therefore conceivedhimself to be at least in part a mind and a body. The entire cult of communism is based uponthe fact that one lives only one life, that there is no hereafter and that the individual has noreligious significance. Man at large has been close to this state for at least the last century. Thestate (condition) is of avery low order, excluding as it does all self-recognition.The SpiritThe thetan (spirit) is described in Scientology as having no mass, no wave-length, noenergy and no time or location in space except by consideration or postulate. The spirit, then, isnot a thing. It is the creator of things.The usual residence of the thetan is in the skull or near the body. A thetan can be in oneof four conditions. The first would be entirely separate from a body or bodies, or even fromthis universe. The second would be near a body and knowingly controlling the body. The thirdwould be in the body (the skull) and the fourth would be an inverted condition whereby he wascompulsively away from the body and could not approach it. There are degrees (subdivisions)of each one of these four states (conditions). The most optimum of these conditions, from thestandpoint of man, is the second.A thetan is subject to deterioration. This is at first difficult to understand since theentirety of his activity consists of considering or postulating. He uses, through his postulates,various methods of controlling a body. That he does deteriorate is manifest, but that he can atany moment return to an entirety of his ability is also factual. In that he associates beingnesswith mass and action, he does not consider himself as having an individual identity or nameunless he is connected with one or more of the games of life.The processes of Scientology can establish this for the individual with greater or lesserrapidity, and one of the many goals of processing in Scientology is to “exteriorize” theindividual and place him in the second condition above, since it has been discovered that he ishappier and more capable when so situated.19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The MindThe mind is a communication and control system between the thetan and hisenvironment. The mind is a network of communications and pictures, energies and masses,which are brought into being by the activities of the thetan versus the physical universe or otherthetans. A thetan establishes various systems of control so that he can continue to operate abody and through the body operate things in the physical universe, as well as other bodies. Themost obvious portion of the mind is recognizable by anyone not in serious condition. This isthe “mental image picture”. In Scientology we call this mental image picture a facsimile when itis a “photograph” of the physical universe sometime in the past. We call this mental imagepicture a mock-up when it is created by the thetan or for the thetan and does not consist of aphotograph of the physical universe. We call a mental image picture a “hallucination”, or moreproperly an automaticity (something uncontrolled) when it is created by another and seen byself.Various phenomena connect themselves with this entity called the mind. Some peopleclosing their eyes see only blackness, some people see pictures. Some people see pictures madeby body reactions. Some people see only black screens. Others see golden lines. Others seespaces. But the keynote of the entirety of the system called the mind is postulate andperception. Easily ten thousand new, separate mental phenomena, not hitherto seen by earlierobservers, have been classified in Scientology and Dianetics.The thetan receives, by the communication system called the mind, variousimpressions, including direct views of the physical universe. In addition to this he receivesimpressions from past activities and, most important, he himself, being close to a totalknowingness, conceives things about the past and future which are independent of immediatelypresent stimuli. The mind is not in its entirety a stimulus-response mechanism as old Marxistpsychology, as once taught in universities, would have one believe. The mind has three maindivisions. The first of these could be called the analytical mind, the second the reactive mind,and the third the somatic mind.The Analytical MindThe analytical mind combines perceptions of the immediate environment, of the past(via pictures) and estimations of the future into conclusions which are based upon the realitiesof situations. The analytical mind combines the potential knowingness of the thetan with theconditions of his surroundings and brings him to independent conclusions. This mind could besaid to consist of visual pictures either of the past or of the physical universe, monitored by,and presided over by, the knowingness of a thetan. The keynote of the analytical mind isawareness. One knows what one is concluding and knows what one is doing.The Reactive MindThe reactive mind is a stimulus-response mechanism, ruggedly built, and operable intrying circumstances. The reactive mind never stops operating. Pictures of the environment, ofa very low order, are taken by this mind even in deep states of unconsciousness. The reactivemind acts below the level of consciousness. It is the literal stimulus-response mind. Given acertain stimulus it gives a certain response. Dianetics concerned itself mainly with this onemind.While it is an order of thinkingness, the ability of the reactive mind to concluderationally is so poor that we find in the reactive mind those various aberrated impulses whichare gazed upon as oddities of personality, eccentricities, neuroses and psychoses. It is thismind which stores up all the bad things that have happened to one and throws them back to himagain in moments of emergency or danger so as to dictate his actions along lines which have20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"been considered “safe” before. As there is little thinkingness involved in this, the courses ofaction dictated by the reactive mind are often not safe, but highly dangerous.The reactive mind is entirely literal in its interpretation of words and actions. As it takespictures and receives impressions during moments of unconsciousness, a phrase uttered whena blow is struck is likely to be literally interpreted by the reactive mind and becomes active uponthe body and analytical mind at later times. The mildest stage of this would be arduous training,wherein a pattern is laid into the mind for later use under certain given stimuli.A harsh and less workable level is the hypnotic trance condition to which the mind issusceptible. Made impressionable by fixed attention, words can be immediately implanted intothe reactive mind which become operable under restimulation at later times.An even lower level in the reactive mind is that one associated with blows, drugs,illness, pain and other conditions of unconsciousness. Phrases spoken over an anaesthetizedperson can have a later effect upon that person. It is not necessarily true that each and everyportion of an operation is painstakingly “photographed” by the reactive mind of theunconscious patient, but it is true that a great many of these stimuli are registered. Completesilence, in the vicinity of a person under anaesthetic or a person who is unconscious or in deeppain, is mandatory if one would preserve the mental health of that person or patient afterwards.Probably the most therapeutic action which could occur to an individual would be,under Scientology processing, the separation of the thetan from the mind so that the thetan,under no duress and with total knowingness, could view himself and his mind and actaccordingly. However, there is a type of exteriorization which is the most aberrative of alltraumatic (mentally injurious) actions. This is the condition when an individual is brought,through injury or surgery or shock, very close to death so that he exteriorizes from body andmind. This exteriorization under duress is sudden, and to the patient inexplicable, and is initself very shocking. When this has occurred to an individual, it is certain that he will suffermentally from the experience afterwards.It could be said that when the reactive mind contains these sudden shocks ofexteriorization under duress, attempts to exteriorize the individual later by Scientology are moredifficult. However, modern processing has overcome this. The phenomenon of exteriorizationunder duress is accompanied at times by energy explosions in the various facsimiles of themind, and these cross-associate in the reactive mind. Therefore, people become afraid ofexteriorization, and at times people are made ill simply by discussing the phenomenon, due tothe fact that they have exteriorized under duress, during some operation, or during someaccident.Exteriorization under duress is the characteristic of death itself. Therefore,exteriorization or the departure of the soul is generally associated with death in the minds ofmost people. It is not necessarily true that one is dead because he exteriorizes, and it isdefinitely not true that exteriorization not accompanied by a shock, pain or duress is at allpainful. Indeed, it is quite therapeutic.The Somatic MindThe third portion of the mind is the somatic mind. This is an even heavier type of mindthan the reactive mind since it contains no thinkingness and contains only actingness. Theimpulses placed against the body by the thetan through various mental machinery arrive at thevoluntary, involuntary and glandular levels. These have set methods of analysis for any givensituation and so respond directly to commands given.Unfortunately the somatic mind is subject to each of the minds higher in scale above itand to the thetan. In other words, the thetan can independently affect the somatic mind. Theanalytical mind can affect the somatic mind. The reactive mind can affect the somatic mind.21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Thus we see that the neurons, the glandular system, the muscles and masses of the body aresubject to various impulses, each one of a lower order than the next. Thus it is not odd todiscover what we call “psychosomatic” illness. A condition exists here where the thetan doesnot have an awareness of burdening the somatic mind with various commands orderangements. Neither does the thetan have an awareness of his own participation in theanalytical mind causing this action against the body.In that the thetan is seldom aware of the reactive mind, it is possible then for the reactivemind, with its stimulusresponse content, to impinge itself directly, and without further recourseor advice, upon the neurons, muscles and glandular system of the body. In that the reactivemind can hold a fixed command in place, causing a derangement in the somatic mind, it ispossible then for illness to exist, for bizarre pains to be felt, for actual physical twists andaberrations to occur, without any conscious knowledge on the part of the thetan. This we callphysical illness caused by the mind. In brief, such illness is caused by perceptions received inthe reactive mind during moments of pain and unconsciousness.Whether the facsimile in the mind is received while the thetan is awake or unconscious,the resulting mass of the energy picture is energy just as you see energy in an electric light bulbor from the flames of a fire. At one time it was considered that mental energy was differentfrom physical energy. In Scientology it has been discovered that mental energy is simply afiner, higher level physical energy. The test of this is conclusive in that a thetan “mocking up”(creating) mental image pictures and thrusting them into the body can increase the body massand, by casting them away again, can decrease the body mass. This test has actually been madeand an increase of as much as 30 pounds, actually measured on scales, has been added to, andsubtracted from, a body by creating “mental energy”. Energy is energy. It has differentwave-lengths and different characteristics. The mental image pictures are capable of reactingupon the physical environment, and the physical environment is capable of reacting on mentalimage pictures. Thus the mind actually consists of spaces, energies and masses of the sameorder as the physical universe, if lighter and different in size and wave-length. For a muchmore comprehensive picture of the mind one should read Dianetics: The Original Thesis andDianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. These were written before the discoveries ofthe upper levels of beingness were made and are a very complete picture of the mind itself, itsstructure and what can be done to it and with it.The BodyThe third part of man is the physical body. This can best be studied in such books asGrey’s Anatomy and other anatomical texts. This is the province of the medical doctor and,usually, the old-time psychiatrist or psychologist who were involved in the main in bodyworship. The body is a purely structural study, and the actions and reactions amongst itsvarious structures are complex and intensely interesting.When Scientology established bio-physics, it did so because of the various discoverieswhich had accumulated concerning mental energy in its reaction against physical energy, andthe activities which took place in the body because of these interactions. Bio-physics onlybecame feasible when it was discovered in Scientology that a fixed electrical field existedsurrounding a body entirely independent of, but influenceable by, the human mind. The bodyexists in its own space. That space is created by “anchor points” (points which are anchored ina space different to the physical universe space around a body). The complexity of these anchorpoints can cause an independent series of electronic flows which can occasion much discomfortto the individual. The balance structure of the body and even its joint action and physicalcharacteristics can be changed by changing this electrical field which exists at a distance from,or within, the body.The electrical field is paramount and monitors the actual physical structure of the body.Thus the body is not only influenced by the three minds, it is influenced as well by its ownelectrical field. An expert Scientologist can discover for the average person this field, and can22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"bring about its adjustment, although this is very far from the primary purpose of theScientologist.The use of electrical shocks upon a body for any purpose is therefore very dangerousand is not condoned by sensible men. Of course, the use of electrical shock was never intendedto be therapeutic, but was intended only to bring about obedience by duress, and, as far as itcan be discovered, to make the entirety of insanity a horror. Electrical shock deranges theelectronic field in the vicinity of the body and is always succeeded by bad health or physicaldifficulties and never does otherwise than hasten the death of the person. It has been stated bypeople using electric shock that if they were denied euthanasia (the right to kill people whowere considered to be a burden on a society) they would at least use partial euthanasia in theform of electric shock, brain surgery and drugs. These treatments in some large percentage ofcases, however, effected euthanasia as they were expected to do.A knowledge of both the mental and physical structure of the body would be necessaryin order to treat the body, and this knowledge has not existed prior to Scientology. The medicaldoctor has achieved many results by working purely with structure and bio-chemical products,and in the field of emergency surgery and obstetrics and orthopaedics, he is indispensable inthe society. Medicine, however, has not previously even contained a definition for “mind” andis not expected to invade the field which belongs properly to Scientology.These three parts of man, the thetan, the mind and the body, are each one differentstudies, but they influence each other markedly and continually. Of the three, the senior entityis the thetan, for without the thetan there would be no mind or animation in the body, whilewithout a body or a mind there is still animation and life in the thetan. The thetan is the person.You are you in a body.Many speculations in the field of para-Scientology have been made. Para-Scientologyincludes all of the uncertainties and unknown territories of life which have not been completelyexplored and explained. However, as studies have gone forward, it has become more and moreapparent that the senior activity of life is that of the thetan, and that in the absence of the spiritno further life exists. In the insect kingdom it is not established whether or not each insect isordered by a spirit or whether one spirit orders enormous numbers of insects. It is notestablished how mutation and evolution occur (if they do), and the general Authorship of thephysical universe is only speculated upon, since Scientology does not invade the EighthDynamic.Some facts, however, are completely known. The first of these is that the individualhimself is a spirit controlling a body via a mind. The second of these is that the thetan is capableof making space, energy, mass and time. The third of these is that the thetan is separable fromthe body without the phenomenon of death, and can handle and control a body from welloutside it. The fourth of these is that the thetan does not care to remember the life which he hasjust lived, after he has parted from the body and the mind. The fifth of these is that a persondying always exteriorizes. The sixth of these is that the person, having exteriorized, usuallyreturns to a planet and procures, usually, another body of the same type of race as before.In para-Scientology there is much discussion about “between lives areas” and otherphenomena which might have passed at one time or another for heaven or hell, but it isestablished completely that a thetan is immortal and that he himself cannot actually experiencedeath and counterfeits it by forgetting. It is adequately manifest that a thetan lives again and thathe is very anxious to put something on the “time track” (something for the future) in order tohave something to come back to, thus we have the anxieties of sex. There must be additionalbodies for the next life.It is obvious that what we create in our societies during this lifetime affects us duringour next lifetime. This is quite different from the “belief”, or the idea, that this occurs. InScientology we have very little to do with forcing people to make conclusions. An individual23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"can experience these things for himself and unless he can do so no one expects him to acceptthem.The manifestation that our hereafter is our next life entirely alters the general concept ofspiritual destiny. There is no argument whatsoever with the tenets of faith since it is notprecisely stated, uniformly, by religions that one immediately goes to a heaven or hell. It iscertain that an individual experiences the effect of the civilization which he has had part increating, in his next lifetime. In other words, the individual comes back. He has aresponsibility for what goes on today since he will experience it tomorrow.Sex has been overweighted in importance in old psychotherapy, an importance more orless disgraced at this time. Sex is only one of numerous creative impulses. An anxiety aboutsex, however, occurs when an individual begins to believe that there will not be a body for himto have during the next lifetime.The common denominator of all aberration (mental derangement) is cessation ofcreation. As sex is only one kind of creation and a rather low order of it, it will be seen thatunhappiness could stem from various cessations of creation. Death itself is a cessation ofcreation. One stops creating the identity John Jones and the environment and things of JohnJones. He stops because he believes he cannot, himself, continue this creation without theassistance of a body, having become dependent upon a mind and a body, the first to do histhinking for him and the second to do his acting. An individual becoming sufficiently moroseon the ideas of creation can actually bring about the condition of an inability to create.ControlIt will be seen that the three parts of man are intimately associated with control. Theanatomy of control is start, change and stop. The loss of control takes place with the loss ofpan-determinism. When one becomes too partisan, braces himself too solidly against theremainder of the environment, he no longer controls the environment to the degree that hemight and so is unable to start, change and stop the environment.It is a scientific definition in Scientology that control consists of start, change and stop.These three manifestations can be graphed alongside the apparent cycle of action: create,survive, destroy. Any person is somewhere along this curve. An individual who is bent mainlyupon survival is intent, usually, upon changing things. An individual who is close to beingdestroyed is bent mainly upon stopping things. An individual who has a free heart and mindabout life is bent upon creating things.There could be three things wrong with any person, and these would be the inability tostart, the inability to change, the inability to stop. Insanity, for the most part, is an inability tostop. A neurosis is a habit which, worsening, flies entirely out of control. One is stopped sooften in life that he becomes an enemy of stopping and dislikes stopping so intensely that hehimself will not stop things. Neurosis and psychosis of all classes are entirely inabilities tostart, to change or to stop.In the matter of the parts of man we discover that all things are initiated by the thetan sofar as action, activity and behavior are concerned. After such an initiation he can be blunted orwarped from course and acted upon in such a way that his attention becomes too fixed alongone line or another and begins to suffer from these three inabilities. However, each one of theparts of man is subject to the anatomy of control.An individual begins first by being unable himself, without help, to start, to change andto stop. Then the mind may become prone to these disabilities and is unable to start, change orto stop at will. Then the body itself can become subject to these three disabilities and is unableto start, to change and to stop. The oddity is, however, that an environment can so work upona thetan that his body becomes disabled through no choice of his own. Similarly the reactive24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"mind can become disabled through no choice of either the body or the thetan. But the thetanhimself, beyond observing the effect of various causes and having initiated the thought to bethere, can only become disabled by becoming too partisan, by becoming too little pan-determined, and so bringing himself into difficulties. These difficulties, however, are entirelythe difficulties of consideration. As the thetan considers, so he is. In the final analysis thethetan has no problems of his own. The problems are always “other people’s problems” andmust exist in the mind or the body or in other people or his surroundings for him to haveproblems. Thus his difficulties are, in the main, difficulties of staying in the game and keepingthe game going.If a thetan can suffer from anything, it is being out-created (created against toothoroughly). The manifestations of being out-created would be the destruction of his owncreations and the overpowering presence of other creations. Thus a thetan can be brought tobelieve that he is trapped if he is out-created.In past dissertations on the subject of the mind and philosophies of life there was a greatdeal of speculation and very little actual proof. Therefore, these philosophies were creations,and one philosopher was at work outcreating another philosopher. In Scientology we have thissingle difference. We are dealing with discoveries. The only things created about Scientologyare the actual books and works in which Scientology is presented. The phenomena ofScientology are discovered and are held in common by all men and all life forms. There is noeffort in Scientology to out-create each and every thetan that comes along. It is, of course,possible to conceive Scientology as a creation, and to conceive that it is overwhelming. Itshould be viewed otherwise, for it is intended as an assistance to life at large, to enable life tomake a better civilization and a better game. There are no tenets in Scientology which cannot bedemonstrated with entirely scientific procedures.25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTCAUSATION OF KNOWLEDGEScientology as a science is composed of many axioms (self-evident truths, as ingeometry). There are some fifty-eight of these axioms in addition to the two hundred moreaxioms of Dianetics which preceded the Scientology axioms.The first axioms in Scientology are:Axiom 1. Life is basically a static. (Definition: A life static has no mass, no motion, nowave-length, no location in space or in time. It has the ability to postulate and to perceive.)Definition: In Scientology, the word “postulate” means to cause a thinkingness orconsideration. It is a specially applied word and is defined as causative thinkingness.Axiom 2. The static is capable of considerations, postulates and opinions.Axiom 3. Space, energy, objects, form and time are the result of considerations madeand/or agreed upon or not by the static, and are perceived solely because the static considersthat it can perceive them.Axiom 4. Space is a viewpoint of dimension. (Space is caused by looking out from apoint. The only actuality of space is the agreed-upon consideration that one perceives throughsomething, and this we call space.)Axiom 5. Energy consists of postulated particles in space. (One considers that energyexists and that he can perceive energy. One also considers that energy behaves according tocertain agreed-upon laws. These assumptions or considerations are the totality of energy.)Axiom 6. Objects consist of grouped particles and solids.Axiom 7. Time is basically a postulate that space and particles will persist. (The rate oftheir persistence is what we measure with clocks and the motion of heavenly bodies.)Axiom 8. The apparency of time is the change of position of particles in space.Axiom 9. Change is the primary manifestation of time.Axiom 10. The highest purpose in the universe is the creation of an effect.These first ten axioms of Scientology are the most fundamental “truths” (by which wemean commonly held considerations). Here we have thought and life and the physical universein their relation, one to the other. Regardless of further considerations, ideas, assumptions andconditions there lies beneath them these first ten truths.It is as though one had entered into an honorable bargain with fellow beings to holdthese things in common. Once this is done, or once such a “contract” or agreement exists, onehas the fundamentals of a universe. Specialized considerations based on the above make one oranother kind of universe.The physical universe which we see around us and in which we live was created onthese fundamentals without regard to Who created it. Its creation was agreed upon. In order toperceive it, one must agree that it exists.There are three classes of universes. There is first, foremost and most evident, thephysical universe of spaces, stars, suns, land, sea, air and living forms. Then there is the otherfellow’s universe which may or may not be agreed upon by his associates. This he holds to26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"himself. The phenomenon of this universe is included in the field of the “mind” as describedearlier. Then, listed last here, but first perceived, is one’s own universe.The phenomenon of universes is an interesting one, since one’s own universe can beoverwhelmed by the universes of others. These in Scientology we call valences (extrapersonalities, cells, apparent beingnesses). Valences and universes are the same thing,essentially.For example, one while living in the physical universe can be overpowered by theuniverse of, let us say, father. While one still retains his own valence or identity, one is yetacting or thinking or suffering or feeling somewhat like father. Even though one is by oneself,there is this additional apparent beingness. Although father is absent, his commands are stillpresent. Thus we get such things as “duty”, “obedience”, “training” and even”education”. Eachone of these is caused by some part of another universe to a greater or lesser degree.Regardless of how one reacts to universes, he still remains in some degree himself. It isthe effort of many to struggle against universes or valences. In fact, this is a game and theessence of games. The totality of the impulse of aberrated people is the effort to separate one’sown self as a thetan from the various universes with which he feels himself too intimatelyassociated. One is only oppressed by a universe when he feels he can have nothing of thatuniverse. One is only victimized by “Father’s universe” when one is in protest against father.One protests against the physical universe only when he feels that he can have no part of it ordoes not belong in it or, as in religion, is not looked upon kindly by what he conceives to bethe Creator of the physical universe. There is a basic law about universes: the postulates of thecreator of any universe are the postulates which “work” in that universe. Thus one may feeluncomfortable in the universe of another.Universes, as considered in games earlier, could be considered the playing fields oflife. One plays willingly or one plays unwillingly. When one begins to play unwillingly he isapt to discover himself victimized by and interiorized into the universe of some game. It isagainst this phenomenon that a person protests. Consider the matter of a jail. On the surface ofit, as Voltaire discovered, a jail provides food and shelter and leisure time. This would seem tobe the ambition of many people, but the jail provides as well a restriction without one’sconsent. The only difference between being in jail and being the king in a castle, so far asliberty is concerned, is one’s own desires in the matter and one’s own ability to commandone’s environment. As a king in a castle one would be causative. His will, statement,thinkingness would have an effect upon others. Being in jail, one is an effect in that thethinkingness of others finds him its target. Here we have in terms of universes the mostrudimentary example of cause and effect.We must, however, assume, because it is so evident, that an individual only gets intotraps and circumstances he intends to get into. Certain it is that, having gotten into such aposition, he may be unwilling to remain in it, but a trap is always preceded by one’s ownchoice of entrance. We must assume a very wide freedom of choice on the part of a thetan,since it is almost impossible to conceive how a thetan could get himself trapped even though heconsented to it. By actual demonstration a thetan goes through walls, barriers, vanishes space,appears anywhere at will and does other remarkable things. It must be, then, that an individualcan be trapped only when he considers that he is trapped. In view of the fact that the totality ofexistence is based upon his own considerations, we find that the limitations he has must havebeen invited by himself— otherwise they could not be eradicated by the individual underprocessing, since the only one who is present with the preclear is the Auditor, and pastassociates of the preclear, while not present, do desensitize, under auditing, in the preclear’smind. Therefore it must have been the preclear who kept them there. The preclear byprocessing can resolve all of his difficulties without going and finding other persons orconsulting other universes. Thus the totality of entrapment, aberration, even injury, torture,insanity and other distasteful items are basically considerations a thetan is making and holdingright now in present time. This must be the case since time itself is a postulate or considerationon his own part.27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The greatest philosophical clamor or quarrel has been waged around the subject of“knowledge”, and there is nothing preposterous on the subject of knowledge that cannot befound in the philosophical texts. The superiority and ascendancy of Scientology depends uponthe fact that it has transcended this philosophical quarrel on the subject of knowingness, andScientology contains in itself the basics of knowledge.By knowledge we mean assured belief, that which is known, information, instruction,enlightenment, learning, practical skill. By knowledge we mean data, factors and whatever canbe thought about or perceived.The reason why knowledge has been misunderstood in philosophy is that it is only halfthe answer. There is no allness to knowledge. By definition, knowledge is that which isperceived or learned or taken from another source. This patently then means that when onelearns he is being an effect.We see in Axiom 10 that “the highest purpose in the universe is the creation of aneffect.” This is in direct contradiction to knowledge, although one of course can know how tocreate an effect.Opposed to knowledge we have the neglected half of existence, which is the creation ofknowledge, the creation of data, the creation of thought, the causative consideration,self-evolved ideas as opposed to ideas otherwise evolved. The reason Scientology is such afascinating study is that it takes apart the other fellow’s ideas and permits one to create some ofhis own. Scientology gives us the common denominators of objects, energies, spaces, uni-verses, livingness and thought itself.There is cause and effect. Cause could be defined as emanation. It could be definedalso, for purposes of communication, as source-point. If you consider a river flowing to thesea, the place where it began would be the source-point or cause, and the place where it wentinto the sea would be the effect-point, and the sea would be the effect of the river. The manfiring the gun is cause; the man receiving the bullet is effect. The one making a statement iscausing a communication, the one receiving the statement is the effect of the communication. Abasic definition of communication is cause-distance-effect.Almost all anxieties and upsets in human relations come about through an imbalance ofcause and effect.One must be willing at once to cause new data, statements, assumptions,considerations, and to receive ideas, assumptions, considerations.So great is the anxiety of a thetan to be an effect that he closely approaches those thingswhich can cause an effect upon him. Thus a thetan becomes trapped. On the face of it so fewthetans make causative data and so many receive data that it would seem, in view of the fact thata thetan can be touched only by his own consideration, that thetans are more anxious for effectsthan to be cause.It is learned under close experiments that there is nothing a thetan actually disdains onan effect level. He pretends not to like or enjoy certain effects and protests against them, but heknows very well that the mechanism of protest causes the effect to approach more closely as ageneral rule. This came about by his repeated failure to cause an effect and to receive no-effectin games. Insisting on no-effect for himself, he lost. Then he had to say he liked the effect.The prevailing anxiety, then, is to be an effect, not to be a cause. The entire subject ofresponsibility is a study of cause and effect in that a person who wants no responsibility isanxious to be an effect only, and a person who can assume responsibility must also be willingto be causative.28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A thetan can be swung into a “state of consideration” by observing that it is commonlyheld by others. This keeps him in the universe and this keeps him being effect.Study, investigation, receiving education and similar activity are all effect activities andresult in the assumption of less responsibility. Thus, while it is true that a thetan cannot actuallyget into trouble, he can, by agreeing with the current agreed-upon thought in the universewhere he finds himself, take a pattern of thinkingness which makes him less effective becausehe wishes to be an effect. If he feels he must gather all of his data from elsewhere, he is thenthe effect of knowledge, the effect of universes and postulates, and he tends to reduce his ownability to form or make knowledge thirst for other thetans’ postulates and would lead one toforget that he himself has been a party to the making of these postulates and that he himself hadto follow a certain course in order to put himself in reach of other thetans’ postulates.(Note to Translators: Lacking a proper English word for “causative thinking”, the word“postulate” has been used in slight difference to its English definition. If there is a word in yourlanguage which means “self-impulsion” or “creation of a thought”, use that instead of “postu-late”.)Because one is the effect of knowledge, causing data, considerations or “facts” to comeinto being separates one in distance from being an effect. If one is very anxious to be an effectand if this is his basic consideration, he will not take well to causing information to come intoexistence, but in order to get him out of the traps in which he finds himself, it is necessary tosome degree that he do so.Causing few barriers or traps, the individual then loses control over barriers or traps;wishing to be an effect, of course he must lose control of barriers and traps, otherwise hecannot be entrapped by them. The thing to do to free him from a trap is to have him find whatparts of the trap he himself is willing to create, own, have or possess. This places the barriers(which can be spaces, energy movements or obstacles) under his control, and his postulatingthat he can have or possess this or that causes him to be willing to be or occupy the trap. Themoment this occurs he is no longer in the trap, or even if he is still in it to some degree he doesnot object to it and can leave it when he wishes.Civilization and SavageryThe way to paralyze a nation entirely and to make it completely ungovernable would beto forbid education of any kind within its borders and to inculcate into every person within itthe feeling that he must not receive any information from anybody about anything. To make anation governable it is necessary to hold a kindly view of education and to honor educativepersons and measures. To conquer a land it is not necessarily efficient to overwhelm it withguns. Once this is done it is necessary to apply educative measures in order to bring aboutsome sort of agreement amongst the people themselves, as well as between the conqueror andthe subdued. Only in this way could one have a society, a civilization or, as we say inScientology, a smoothly running game.In other words, two extremes could be reached, neither one of which is desirable forthe individual. The first extreme could be reached by emphasis only upon self-created data orinformation. This would bring about not only a lack of interpersonal relations, but also ananxiety to have an effect which would, as it does in barbaric peoples, result in social crueltyunimaginable in a civilized nation. The other extreme would be to forbid in its entirety anyself-created information and to condone only data or considerations generated by others thanself. Here we would create an individual with no responsibility, so easily handled that hewould be only a puppet.Self-created data is then not a bad thing, neither is education, but one without the otherto hold it in some balance will bring about a no-game condition or a nocivilization. Just asindividuals can be seen by observing nations, so we see the African tribesman, with his29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"complete contempt for truth and his emphasis on brutality and savagery for others but nothimself, is a no-civilization. And we see at the other extreme China, slavishly dedicated toancient scholars, incapable of generating within herself sufficient rulers to continue, withoutbloodshed, a nation.We have noted the individual who must be the only one who can make a postulate orcommand, whose authority is dearer to him than the comfort or state of millions, and we havesuffered from such men (Napoleon, Hitler, Kaiser Wilhelm, Frederick of Prussia, GenghisKhan, Attila). We have known, too, the scholar who has studied himself into blindness and isthe world’s greatest authority on government or some such thing, who yet cannot himselfmanage his bank account or a dog with any certainty. Here we have, in either case, a totalimbalance. The world shaker is himself unwilling to be any effect of any kind (and all the mennamed here were arrant personal cowards) and we have the opposite, a man who would notknow what you were talking about if you told him to get an idea of his own.We see another example of this in the fundamental laws of warfare. A body of troops,to be effective, must be able to attack and to defend. Its implements must be divided 50% forattack and 50% for defense. In other words, even in a crude activity such as warfare, we findthat no successful outcome is possible unless the troops can devote half of their energies toattack and half of them to defense.In the much broader view of life we discover on any dynamic that success or a game oractivity or life itself depends upon being willing to be cause as well as willing to be an effect.He who would give must be willing to receive. He who would receive must be willing to give.When these tenets are violated, the most fundamental principle of human relationships isviolated, and the result is a no-game condition such as aberration, insanity, anti-socialness,criminality, inactivity, laziness, tiredness, mania, fanaticism and all the other things againstwhich men protest. But imbalances between cause and effect also enter randomities(unpredicted motions) into the game of life and cannot be neglected in their potential forcreating a game.Any information is valuable to the degree that you can use it. In other words, anyinformation is valuable to the degree that you can make it yours. Scientology, of all thesciences, does not teach you—it only reminds you, for the information was yours in the firstplace. It is not only the science of life, but it is an account of what you were doing before youforgot what you were doing.30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEKNOW AND NOT-KNOWIt is a mechanism of thinkingness, whether one is postulating or receiving information,that one retain one’s ability to know. It is equally important that one retain one’s ability tonot-know. Thought consists entirely of knowing and not-knowing and the shades of graybetween.You will discover that most people are trying not to remember. In other words, they aretrying to not-know. Education can only become burdensome when one is unable to not-knowit. It is necessary that one be able to create, to receive, to know, and to not-know information,data and thoughts. Lacking any one of these skills, for they are skills, no matter how nativethey are to the individual, one is apt to get into a chaos of thinkingness or creatingness orlivingness.You can look at any eccentric or aberrated person and discover rapidly, by an inspectionof him, which one of these four factors he is violating. He either is unable to know ornot-know his own created thoughts, or he is unable to know or not-know the thoughts ofothers. Somewhere, for some reason best known to him, in his anxiety to be part of the game,he has shelved or lost one of these abilities.Time is a process of knowing in the present and not-knowing in the future or the past.Remembering is the process of knowing the past; prediction is the process of knowing thefuture. Forgetting is the process of notknowing the past, and living “only for today” is theprocess of not-knowing the future.Exercises in these various items rehabilitate not only the sanity or ability of theindividual, but his general capability in living and playing the game.31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENTHE GOAL OF SCIENTOLOGYThe end object of Scientology is not the making into nothing of all of existence or thefreeing of the individual of any and all traps everywhere.The goal of Scientology is the making of the individual capable of living a better life inhis own estimation and with his fellows, and the playing of a better game.32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENSCIENTOLOGY PROCESSINGScientology is applied in many ways to many fields. One particular and specializedmethod of application of Scientology is its use on individuals and groups of people in theeradication of physical problems deriving from mental states and the improvement of theirabilities and intelligence. By processing is meant the verbal exercising of an individual(preclear) in exact Scientology processes. There is a great deal of terminology and precision inthese processes and their use, and they are not combinable with older mental activities such aspsychiatry, psychology, psychoanalysis, yoga, massage, etc. However, these processes arecapable of addressing or treating the same ills of the mind as are delineated by oldermethodology, with the addition that Scientology is alone in its ability to successfully eradicatethose psychosomatic problems to which it is addressed. It is the only science or study knownwhich is capable of uniformly producing marked and significant increases in intelligence andgeneral ability.Scientology processing amongst other things can improve the intelligence quotient of anindividual, his ability or desire to communicate, his social attitudes, his capability and domesticharmony, his fertility, his artistic creativity, his reaction time and his health.An additional sphere of activity allied to processing is preventive Scientology. In thisbranch of processing, an individual is freed from assuming states lower than those he hasalready suffered from. In other words, the progress of tendencies, neuroses, habits anddeteriorating activities can be halted by Scientology or their occurrence can be prevented. Thisis done by processing the individual on standard Scientology processes without particular atten-tion to the aberration involved.Scientology processing is called “auditing”, by which the auditor (practitioner) “listens,computes and commands”. The auditor and preclear (person receiving auditing) are togetherout-of-doors or in a quiet place where they will not be disturbed or where they are not beingsubjected to interrupting influences. The purpose of the auditor is to give the preclear certainand exact commands which the preclear can follow and perform. The purpose of the auditor isto increase the ability of the preclear. The Auditor’s Code is the governing set of rules for thegeneral activity of auditing. The Code follows:The Auditor’s Code1. Do not evaluate for the preclear.2. Do not invalidate or correct the preclear’s data.3. Use the processes which improve the preclear’s case.4. Keep all appointments once made.5. Donotprocessapreclearafter 10p.m.6. Do not process a preclear who is improperly fed or who has not received enough rest.7. Do not permit a frequent change of auditors.8. Do not sympathize with the preclear.9. Never permit the preclear to end the session on his own independent decision.10. Never walk off from a preclear during a session.11. Never get angry with a preclear.12. Always reduce every communication lag encountered by continued use of the samequestion or process.13. Always continue a process as long as it produces change and no longer.14. Be willing to grant beingness to the preclear.15. Never mix the processes of Scientology with those of various other practices.16. Maintain two-way communication with the preclear.33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"17. Never use Scientology to obtain personal and unusual favors or unusual compliancefrom the preclear for the auditor’s own personal profit.18. Estimate the current case of your preclear with reality and do not audit another imaginedcase.19. Do not explain, justify, or make excuses for any auditor mistakes whether real orimagined.The Auditor’s Code governs the activity of the auditor during sessions. The activity ofthe Scientologist in general is governed by another broader code.The Code of a ScientologistAs a Scientologist, I pledge myself to the code of Scientology for the good of all:1. To hear or speak no word of disparagement to the press, public or preclears concerningany of my fellow Scientologists, our professional organization or those whose namesare closely connected to this Science, nor to place in danger any such person.2. To use the best I know of Scientology to the best of my ability to better my preclears,groups and the world.3. To refuse to accept for processing and to refuse to accept money from any preclear orgroup I feel I cannot honestly help.4. To deter to the fullest extent of my power anyone misusing or degrading Scientology toharmful ends.5. To prevent the use of Scientology in advertisements of other products.6. To discourage the abuse of Scientology in the press.7. To employ Scientology to the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics.8. To render good processing, sound training and good discipline to those students orpeoples entrusted to my care.9. To refuse to impart the personal secrets of my preclear.s10. To engage in no unseemly disputes with the uninformed on the subject of myprofession.11. To completely refrain from discussing the case of another auditor’s preclear with thatpreclear or within his hearing.As it can be seen, both of these codes are designed to protect the preclear as well asScientology and the auditor in general. As these codes evolve from many years of observationand experience by a great number of people, it can be said that they are intensely important andare probably complete. Failure to observe them has resulted in a failure of Scientology.Scientology can do what it can do only when it is used within the limits of these two codes.Thus it can be seen that the interjection of peculiarities or practices by the auditor intoScientology processing can actually nullify and eradicate the benefits of that processing. Anyhope or promise in Scientology is conditional upon its good use by the individual and its use inparticular within the limits of these two codes.The Conditions of AuditingCertain definite conditions must prevail and a certain methodology must be followed inorder that processing may be beneficial to its fullest extent. Probably the first condition is agood grasp of Scientology as a science and its mission in the world. The second conditionwould be a relaxed state of mind on the part of the auditor and the confidence that his use ofScientology upon the preclear will not produce a harmful result. The third requisite should befinding a preclear. By this it is literally meant that one should discover somebody willing to beprocessed, and, having discovered one so willing, should then make sure that he is aware thathe is there being processed. The fourth requisite would be a quiet place in which to audit, withevery precaution taken that the preclear will not be interrupted or burst in upon or undulystartled during processing.34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEEXACT PROCESSESAuditingGame and No-Game ConditionsIn Scientology, the most important single elements to the auditor are Game Conditionsand No-Game Conditions. Reason—all games are aberrative.All processing is directed toward game conditions. Little or no processing is directedtoward no-game conditions. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to know exactly whatthese are, for one could be superficial about it and lose.Rule—all Games are aberrative, some are fun.The Elements of Games to auditors are:A game consists of freedoms, barriers and purposes.In a game one’s own team or self must receive no-effect and must deliver an effect uponthe other team or opponent.A game should have space and, preferably, a playing field.A game is played in the same time continuum for both sides (all players).A game must have something which one does not have in order for it to be won.Some part of the dynamics must be excluded for a game condition to exist. The amountof the dynamics excluded represents the tone of the game.Games occur only when there is intention opposing intention, purpose opposingpurpose.A scarcity of games forces the preclear to accept less desirable games.Participation in any game (whether it be the game of sick-man, jealous-wife or polio) ispreferable to being in a no-game condition.The type of game entered by a person is determined by his consideration as to howmuch and what kind of an effect he may receive while trying to deliver an effect.Games are the basic mechanism for continuing attention.To play a game one must be able to not-know his past and future and not-know hisopponent’s complete intentions.Game Conditions are:AttentionIdentityEffect on OpponentsNo-effect on SelfCan’t Have on opponents and goals and their areasHave on tools of play, own goals and fieldPurposeProblems of play35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Self-determinismOpponentsThe possibility of lossThe possibility of winningCommunicationNon-arrivalNo-Game Conditions are:Knowing AllNot-Knowing EverythingSerenityNamelessnessNo-effect on opponentEffect on self or teamHave everythingCan’t Have nothingSolutionsPan-DeterminismFriendship with AllUnderstandingTotal CommunicationNo CommunicationWinLoseNo UniverseNo Playing FieldArrivalDeathProcess only with those conditions listed as Game Conditions. Do not process directlytoward those conditions listed as No-Game Conditions. So doing, the auditor will run out(erase) the aberrative effect of games and restore an ability to play a game.Identities—ValencesThere are four identities or valences.When one is in his “own” valence he is said to be “himself “.As he departs from his own identity he comes in to the following:Exchanged Valence: One has directly superimposed the identity of another on his own.Example—Daughter becomes own mother to some degree. Remedy—One directly runs outmother.Attention Valence: One has become the valence B because one wants attention from C.Example—One becomes mother because mother received attention from father while self didnot. Remedy—Run out father even though preclear appears in valence of mother.Synthetic Valence: One takes a valence about which he has been told. Example—Mother tells child false things about father, accuses child of being like father, with result thatchild is forced into father’s valence. Remedy—Run out mother even though preclear does notseem to be near mother’s valence.All requisites for auditing from here on are entirely concerned with procedures andprocesses. By auditing procedure is meant the general model of how one goes about addressinga preclear. This includes an ability to place one question worded exactly the same way over and36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"over again to the preclear no matter how many times the preclear has answered the question. Itshould include the ability to acknowledge with a “good” and “all right” every time a preclearexecutes or completes the execution of a command. It should include the ability to accept acommunication from the preclear. When the preclear has something to say, the auditor shouldacknowledge the fact that he has received the preclear.s communication and should pay someattention to the communication.Procedure also includes the ability to sense when the preclear is being over-strained byprocessing or is being unduly annoyed and to handle such crises in the session to prevent thepreclear from leaving. An auditor should also have the ability of handling startling remarks oroccurrences by the preclear. An auditor should also have the knack of preventing the preclearfrom talking obsessively since prolonged conversation markedly reduces the havingness of thepreclear, and the sooner long dissertations by the preclear are cut off the better for the sessionin general.Processes as distinct from procedures consist of utilizing the principle of the gradientscale to the end of placing the preclear in better control of himself, his mind, the people and theuniverse around him.By gradient scale is meant a proceeding from simplicity toward greater difficulty, givingthe preclear always no more than he can do, but giving him as much as he can do until he canhandle a great deal. The idea here is to give the preclear nothing but wins and to refrain fromgiving the preclear losses in the game of processing. Thus it can be seen that processing is ateam activity and is not itself a game whereby the auditor opposes and seeks to defeat thepreclear and the preclear seeks to defeat the auditor, for when this condition exists little resultsin processing.The earliest stage of auditing consists in taking over control of the preclear so as torestore to the preclear more control of himself than he has had. The most fundamental step isthen location, whereby the preclear is made to be aware of the fact that he is in an auditingroom, that an auditor is present and that the preclear is being a preclear.Those conditions will become quite apparent if one realizes that it would be verydifficult for a son to process a father. A father is not likely to recognize anything else than theboy he raised in his auditor. Therefore the father would have to be made aware of the fact thatthe son was a competent practitioner before the father could be placed under control inprocessing. One of the most elementary commands in Scientology is “Look at me, who am I?”After a preclear has been asked to do this many times until he can do so quickly and accuratelyand without protest, it can be said that the preclear will have “found” the auditor.The preclear is asked by the auditor to control, which is to say, start, change and stop(the anatomy of control) anything he is capable of controlling. In a very bad case this might bea very small object being pushed around on a table, being started and changed and stopped eachtime specifically and only at the auditor’s command until the preclear himself realizes that hehimself can start, change and stop the object. Sometimes four or five hours spent in thisexercise are very well spent on a very difficult preclear.The preclear is then asked to start, change and stop his own body under the auditor’sspecific and precise direction. In all of his commands the auditor must be careful never to give asecond command before the first one has been fully obeyed. A preclear in this procedure iswalked around the room and is made to start, change the direction of and stop his body,emphasizing one of these at a time, until he realizes that he can do so with ease. Only nowcould it be said that a session is well in progress or that a preclear is securely under theauditor’s command.It should be noted especially that the goal of Scientology is better self-determinism forthe preclear. This rules out at once hypnotism, drugs, alcohol or other control mechanisms37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"used by other and older therapies. It will be found that such things are not only not necessary,but they are in direct opposition to the goals of greater ability for the preclear.The principal points of concentration for the auditor now become the ability of thepreclear to have, the ability of the preclear to not-know, and the ability of the preclear to play agame.An additional factor is the ability of the preclear to be himself and not a number of otherpeople, such as his father, his mother, his marital partner or his children.The ability of the preclear is increased by addressing to him the process known as theTrio. These are three questions, or rather commands.1. “Look around here and tell me what you could have.”2. “Look around here and tell me what you would permit to remain in place.”3. “Look around here and tell me with what you could dispense.”No. 1 above is used usually about ten times, then No. 2 is used five times, and No. 3 isused once. This ratio of ten, five and one would be an ordinary or routine approach tohavingness. The end in view is to bring the preclear into a condition whereby he can possess orown or have whatever he sees, without further conditions, ramifications or restrictions. This isthe most therapeutic of all processes, elementary as it might seem. It is done without too muchtwo-way communication or discussion with the preclear, and it is done until the preclear cananswer questions one, two and three equally well. It should be noted at once that twenty-fivehours of use of this process by an auditor upon a preclear brings about a very high rise in tone.By saying twenty-five hours it is intended to give the idea of the length of time the processshould be used. As it is a strain on the usual person to repeat the same question over and over,it will be seen that an auditor should be well disciplined or very well trained before he audits.In the case of a preclear who is very unable, “Can’t have “ is substituted for “have”,etc., in each of the above questions for a few hours, until the preclear is ready for the Trio in its“have” form. This can-can’t is the plus and minus aspect of all thought and in Scientology iscalled by a specialized word dichotomy.The rehabilitation of the ability of the preclear to not-know is also rehabilitation of thepreclear in the time stream since the process of time consists of knowing the moment andnot-knowing the past and not-knowing the future simultaneously. This process, like all otherScientology processes, is repetitive. The process is run, ordinarily, only after the preclear is invery good condition and is generally run in an exterior well inhabited place. Here the auditor,without exciting public comment, indicates a person and asks the preclear “Can you not-knowsomething about that person?” The auditor does not permit the preclear to “not-know” thingswhich the preclear already doesn’t know. The preclear “not-knows” only those things whichare visible and apparent about the person. This is also run on objects in the environment suchas walls, floors, chairs and other things. The auditor should not be startled when for thepreclear large chunks of the environment start to disappear. This is ordinary routine and ineffect the preclear should make the entirety of the environment disappear at his own command.The environment does not disappear for the auditor. The end goal of this “not-know” process isthe disappearance of the entire universe, under the preclear’s control, but only for the preclear.It will be discovered while running this that the preclear’s “havingness” maydeteriorate. If this happens, he was not run enough on the Trio before he was run on thisprocess. It is only necessary in such a case to intersperse“Look around here and tell me what you could have” with the “not-know” command tokeep the preclear in good condition. Drop of havingness is manifested by nervous agitation,obsessive talk or semi-unconsciousness or “dopiness” on the part of the preclear. These mani-festations indicate only reduction of havingness.38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The reverse of the question here is “Tell me something that you would be willing tohave that person (indicated by the auditor) not-know about you.” Both sides of the questionhave to be run (audited). This process can be continued for twenty-five hours or even fifty orseventyfive hours of auditing with considerable benefit so long as it does not react too violentlyupon the preclear in terms of loss of havingness.It should be noted that, in running either havingness or “not-know” on a preclear, thepreclear may “exteriorize”. In other words, it may become apparent, either by his observationor because the preclear informs him, that the auditor has “exteriorized” a preclear. Under “TheParts of Man” section there is an explanation of this phenomenon In modern auditing theauditor does not do anything odd about this beyond receive and be interested in the preclear’sstatement of the fact. The preclear should not be permitted to become alarmed since it is a usualmanifestation. A preclear is in better condition and will audit better exteriorized than “in hishead”. Understanding that an actual ability to “not-know” is an ability to erase the past byself-command without suppressing it with energy or going into any other method is necessaryto help the preclear. It is the primary rehabilitation in terms of knowingness. Forgetting is alower manifestation than “not-knowingness”.The third ability to be addressed by the auditor is the ability of the preclear to play agame. First and foremost in the requisites to playing a game is the ability to control. One mustbe able to control something in order to participate in a game. Therefore the generalrehabilitation of control by starting, changing and stopping things is a rehabilitation of theability to play a game. When a preclear refuses to recover, it is because the preclear is using hisstate as a game, and does not believe that there is any better game for him to play than the statehe is in. He may protest if this is called a game. Nevertheless, any condition will surrender ifthe auditor has the preclear invent similar conditions or even tell lies about the existingcondition. Inventing games or inventing conditions or inventing problems alike rehabilitates theability to play a game. Chief amongst these various rehabilitation factors are control (start,change and stop), problems, and the willingness to overwhelm or be overwhelmed. One ceasesto be able to have games when one loses control over various things, when one becomes shortof problems and when one is unwilling to be overwhelmed (in other words, to lose) or tooverwhelm (to win). It will be found while running havingness as in the Trio above that onemay run down the ability to play a game, since havingness is the reward of a game in part.In the matter of problems it will be seen that these are completely necessary to theplaying of a game. The anatomy of a problem is intention versus intention. This is, of course,in essence the purpose of all games, to have two sides, each one with an opposed intention.Technically a problem is two or more purposes in conflict. It is very simple to detect whether ornot the preclear is suffering from a scarcity of games. The preclear who needs more gamesclutches to himself various present-time problems. If an auditor is confronted with a preclearwho is being obsessed by a problem in present-time he knows two things: (1) that thepreclear’s ability to play agame islow, and (2) that he must run an exact process at once torehabilitate the preclear in session.It often happens at the beginning of an auditing session that the preclear hasencountered a heavy present-time problem between sessions. The preclear must always beconsulted before the session is actually in progress as to whether or not he has “anythingworrying” him. To a preclear who is worried about some present-time situation or problem noother process has any greater effectiveness than the following one. The auditor after a verybrief discussion of the problem asks the preclear “to invent” a problem of comparablemagnitude. He may have to re-word this request to make the preclear understand it completely,but the auditor wants in essence the preclear to invent or create a problem he considers similarto the problem he has. If the preclear is unable to do this, it is necessary then to have him lieabout the problem which he has. Lying is the lowest order of creativeness. After he has liedabout the problem for a short time, it will be found that he will be able to invent problems. Heshould be made to invent problem after problem until he is no longer concerned with hispresent-time problem.39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The auditor should understand that a preclear who is “now willing to do somethingabout the problem” has not been run long enough on the invention of problems of comparablemagnitude. As long as the preclear is attempting to do something about the problem, theproblem is still of obsessive importance to him. No session can be continued successfully untilsuch a present-time problem is entirely flat, and it has been the experience, when a present-timeproblem was not completely eradicated by this process, that the remainder of the session orindeed the entire course of auditing may be interrupted.When a preclear does not seem to be advancing under auditing, a thing which he doesmarkedly and observedly, it must then be supposed that the preclear has a present-time problemwhich has not been eradicated and which must be handled in auditing. Although the auditorgives the preclear to understand that he too believes this present-time problem is extremelyimportant, the auditor should not believe that this process will not handle any present-timeproblem, since it will. This process should be done on some preclears in company with theTrio.If the preclear is asked to “lie about” or “invent a problem of comparable magnitude,”and while doing so becomes agitated or unconscious or begins to talk wildly or obsessively, itmust be assumed that he will have to have some havingness run on him until the agitation ormanifestation ceases so that the problem of comparable magnitude process can be resumed.Another aspect of the ability to play a game is the willingness to win and the willingnessto lose. An individual has to be willing to be cause or willing to be an effect. As far as gamesare concerned, this is reduced to a willingness to win and a willingness to lose. People becomeafraid of defeat and afraid of failure. The entire anatomy of failure is only that one’s postulatesor intentions are reversed in action. For instance, one intends to strike a wall and strikes it. Thatis a win. One intends not to strike a wall and doesn’t strike it. That is again a win. One intendsnot to strike a wall and strikes it. That is a lose. One intends to strike a wall and can’t strike it.This is again a lose. It will be seen in this as well as other things that the most significanttherapy there is is changing one’s mind. All things are as one considers they are and no otherway. If it is sufficiently simple to give the definition of winning and losing, so it is simple toprocess the matter.This condition is best expressed, it appears, in processing by a process known as“overwhelming”. An elementary way of running this is to take the preclear outside where thereare numbers of people to observe and, indicating a person, to ask the preclear “What couldoverwhelm that person?” When the preclear answers this, he is asked about the same person,“What could that person overwhelm?” He is then asked as the third question, “Look aroundhere and tell me what you could have. “ These three questions are run one after the other. Thenanother person is chosen and then the three questions are asked again.This process can be varied in its wording, but the central idea must remain as above.The preclear can be asked, “What would you permit to overwhelm that person?” and “Whatwould you permit that person to overwhelm?” and of course “Look around here and tell mewhat you could have. “ This is only one of a number of possible processes on the subject ofoverwhelming, but it should be noted that asking the preclear to think of things which wouldoverwhelm him could be fatal to the case. Where overwhelming is handled, the preclear shouldbe given a detached view.A counter-position to havingness processes, but one which is less therapeutic, is“separateness”. One asks the preclear to look around and discover things which are separatefrom things. This is repeated over and over. It is, however, destructive of havingness eventhough it will occasionally prove beneficial.It will be seen that havingness (barriers), “notknowingness” (being in present time andnot in the past or the future), purposes (problems, antagonists, or intentioncounter-intention),and separateness (freedom) will cover the anatomy of games. It is not to be thought, however,40"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"that havingness addresses itself only to games. Many other factors enter into it. In amongst allof these, it is of. the greatest single importance.One addresses in these days of Scientology the subjective self, the mind, as little aspossible. One keeps the preclear alert to the broad environment around him. An address to thevarious energy patterns of the mind is less beneficial than exercises which directly approachother people or the physical universe. Therefore, asking a preclear to sit still and answer thequestion “What could you have?”, when it is answered by the preclear from his experience oron the score of things which are not present, is found to be non-therapeutic and is foundinstead to decrease the ability and intelligence of the preclear. This is what is known as asubjective (inside the mind only) process.These are the principal processes which produce marked gains. There are otherprocesses and there are combinations of processes, but these given here are the most important.A Scientologist knowing the mind completely can of course do many “tricks” with theconditions of people to improve them. One of these is the ability to address a psychosomaticillness such as a crippled leg which, having nothing physically wrong with it, yet is not usable.The auditor could ask the preclear “Tell me a lie about your leg” with a possible relief of thepain or symptoms. Asking the preclear repeatedly “Look around here and tell me somethingyour leg could have” would undoubtedly release the somatic. Asking the preclear with the badleg “What problem could your leg be to you?” or desiring him to “Invent a problem ofcomparable magnitude to your leg” would produce a distinct change in the condition of the leg.This would apply to any other body part or organ. It would also apply, strangely enough, tothe preclear’s possessions. If a preclear had avehicle or cart which was out of repair ortroublesome to him, one could ask him “What problem could a cart be to you?” and thusrequesting him to invent many such problems one would discover that he had solved hisproblems with the cart. There is a phenomenon in existence that the preclear already has manyset games, and when the auditor asks him to give some problems, he already has the mani-festations of as-ising or erasing taking place. Thought erases; therefore the number of problemsor games the preclear would have would be reduced by asking him to recount those which healready has. Asking the preclear to describe his symptoms is far less therapeutic and may resultin a worsening of those symptoms, contrary to what some schools of thought have believed inthe past but which accounts for their failures.There are specific things which one must avoid in auditing. These follow:1. Significances. The easiest thing a thetan does is change his mind. The most difficultthing he does is handle the environment in which he finds himself situated. Therefore, asking athetan to run out various ideas is a fallacy. It is a mistake. Asking the preclear to think oversomething can also be an error. Asking a preclear to do exercises which concern his mind alonecan be entirely fatal. A preclear is processed between himself and his environment. If he isprocessed between himself and his mind, he is processed up too short a view and his conditionwill worsen.2. Two-way communication. There can be far too much two-way communication or fartoo much communication in an auditing session. Communication involves the reduction ofhavingness. Letting a preclear talk on and on or obsessively is to let a preclear reduce hishavingness. The preclear who is permitted to go on talking will talk himself down the tonescale and into a bad condition. It is better for the auditor simply and discourteously to tell apreclear to “shut up” than to have the preclear run himself “out of the bottom” on havingness.You can observe this for yourself if you permit a person who is not too able to talk about histroubles to keep on talking. He will begin to talk more and more hectically. He is reducing hishavingness. He will eventually talk himself down the tone scale into apathy at which time hewill be willing to tell you (as you insist upon it) that he “feels better” when, as a matter of fact,he is actually worse. Asking a preclear “How do you feel now4” can reduce his havingnesssince he looks over his present-time condition and as-ises some mass.41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"3. Too many processes. It is possible to run a preclear on too many processes in tooshort a time with a reduction of the preclear’s recovery. This is handled by observing thecommunication lag of the preclear. It will be discovered that the preclear will space his answersto a repeated question differently with each answer. When a long period ensues between thequestion and his answer to the question a second time, he is said to have a “communicationlag”. The “communication lag” is the length of time between the placing of the question by theauditor and the answering of that exact question by the preclear. It is not the length of timebetween the placing of the question by the auditor and some statement by the preclear.It will be found that the communication lag lengthens and shortens on a repeatedquestion. The question on the tenth time it has been asked may detect no significant lag. This isthe time to stop asking that question since it now has no appreciable communication lag. Onecan leave any process when the communication lag for three successive questions is the same.In order to get from one process to another, one employs a communication bridge which to amarked degree reduces the liability of too many processes. A communication bridge is alwaysused.Before a question is asked, the preclear should have the question discussed with himand the wording of the question agreed upon, as though he were making a contract with theauditor. The auditor says that he is going to have the preclear do certain things and finds out ifit’s all right with the preclear if the auditor asks him to do these things. This is the first part of acommunication bridge. It precedes all questions, but when one is changing from one process toanother the bridge becomes a bridge indeed. One levels out the old process by asking thepreclear whether or not he doesn’t think it is safe to leave that process now. One discusses withthe preclear the possible benefit received from the process and then tells the preclear that he isno longer going to use that process. Now he tells the preclear he is going to use a new process,describes the process and gets an agreement on it. When the agreement is achieved, then heuses this process. The communication bridge is used at all times. The last half of it, theagreement on a new process, is used always before any process is begun.4. Failure to handle the present-time problem. Probably more cases are stalled or foundunable to benefit in processing because of the neglect of the present-time problem, as coveredabove, than any other single item.5. Unconsciousness, “dopiness” or agitation on the part of the preclear is not a mark ofgood condition. It is a loss of havingness. The preclear must never be processed intounconsciousness or “dopiness”. He should always be kept alert. The basic phenomenon ofunconsciousness is “a flow which has flowed too long in one direction.” If one talks too longat somebody he will render him unconscious. In order to wake up the target of all that talk, it isnecessary to get the person to do some talking. It is simply necessary to reverse any flow tomake unconsciousness disappear, but this is normally cared for in modern Scientology byrunning the Trio above.The Future of ScientologyWith man now equipped with weapons sufficient to destroy all mankind on Earth, theemergence of a new science capable of handling man is vital. Scientology is such a science. Itwas born in the same crucible as the atomic bomb. The basic intelligence of Scientology camefrom nuclear physics, higher mathematics and the understanding of the ancients in the East.Scientology can and does do exactly what it says it can do. In Washington, D, there is anenormous file cabinet filled with thousands of case histories, fully validated and sworn to,which attest the scientific thoroughness of Scientology. With Scientology man can preventinsanity, criminality and war. It is for man to use. It is for the betterment of man. The primaryrace of Earth is not between one nation and another today. The only race that matters at thismoment is the one being run between Scientology and the atomic bomb. The history of man, ashas been said by well-known authorities, may well depend upon which one wins.42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"43"}]
